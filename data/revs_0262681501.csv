0,0262681501,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1899725-lily,2,"Back in my ~2nd year of grad school, a mentor that I respected (and still respect) recommended this book to me. I quite happily picked up this 1897 text, eager to glean the wisdom of a Nobel prize-winning neuroscientist. Unfortunately, this turned out to be an almost unbearable read at the time, and when I leafed through it again recently... yep, still unbearable. I'll admit that it contains some helpful guidance about a lot of the psychological pitfalls that a young scientist might come across, even if that guidance is delivered in a condescending tone. (He'd have you think that books and hobbies are dangerously distracting.)The book's true downfall is when it comes to discussing women. Not women scientists, because those specimens are too rare to warrant much discussion, but women as wives of scientists. Here's a taste:A woman loves tradition, adores privilege, pays little attention to justice, and is usually indifferent to all work related to change and progress. In contrast, a man loathes routine and privilege, reveres justice, and in many cases places the cause of humanity above the interests of his family...[A scientist] will not simply choose a woman, but a woman who belongs to him, whose best dowry will be a sensitive compliance with his wishes, and a warm and full-hearted acceptance of her husband’s view of life.And this just goes on and on. It worries me that professors in the 21st century still uncritically suggest this book to their trainees. It just goes to show that being a scientist, even a Nobel prize-winning one, is not synonymous with being forward-thinking. Better to figure things out as you go, rather than to absorb this over-long advice column that propagates notions that ought to be dead by now, but aren't. "

But unfortunately, much of this work is so dated that it's not helpful to the modern would-be investigator. Examples: endless reference to ""men of science,"" talk of the necessity to learn German to succeed, rambling about money and patriotism that doesn't make sense outside of Spain, the chapter on choosing a suitable wife to compliment one's career, and many others."

Books, like people, we respect and admire for their good qualities, but we only love them for some of their defects.
Santiago Ramón y Cajal has a fair claim to being the greatest scientist to hail from Spain. I have heard him called the “Darwin of Neuroscience”: his research and discoveries are foundational to our knowledge of the brain. When he won the Nobel Prize in 1906 it was for his work using nerve stains to differentiate neurons. At the time, you see, the existence of nerve cells was still highly controversial; Camillo Golgi, with whom Ramón y Cajal shared the Nobel, was a supporter of the reticular theory, which held that the nervous system was one continuous object.Aside from being an excellent scientist, Ramón y Cajal was also a man of letters and a passionate teacher. These three aptitudes combined to produce this charming book. Its prosaic title is normally translated into English—inaccurately but more appealingly—as Advice to a Young Investigator. These originated as lectures delivered in the Real Academia de Ciencias Exactas, Físicas y Naturales in 1897 and published the next year by his colleague. They consist of warm and frank advice to students embarking on a scientific career.Ramón y Cajal is wonderfully optimistic when it comes to the scientific enterprise. Like the philosopher Susan Haack, he thinks that science follows no special logic or method, but is only based on sharpened common sense. Thus one need not be a genius to make a valuable contribution. Indeed, for him, intelligence is much overrated. Focus, dedication, and perseverance are what really separate the successes from the failures. He goes on to diagnose several infirmities of the will that prevent young and promising students from accomplishing anything in the scientific field. Among these are megalófilos, a type exemplified in the character Casaubon in Middlemarch, who cannot finish taking notes and doing research in time to actually write his book.While much of Ramón y Cajal’s advice is timeless, this book is also very much of a time and a place. He advises his young students to buy their own equipment and to work at home—something that would be impractical today, not least because the equipment used in laboratories today has grown so much in complexity and expense. He even advises his student on finding the right wife (over-cultured women are to be avoided). More seriously, these lectures are marked by the crisis of 1898, when Spain lost the Spanish-American war and the feeling of cultural degeneration was widespread. Ramón y Cajal is painfully aware that Spain lagged behind the other Western countries in scientific research, and much of these lectures is aimed alleviating at specifically Spanish shortcomings.In every one of these pages Ramón y Cajal’s fierce dedication to the scientific enterprise, his conviction that science is noble, useful, and necessary, and his desire to see the spirit of inquiry spread far and wide, are expressed with pungent wit that cannot fail to infect the reader with the same zeal and with an admiration for such an exemplary scientist."

Enjoyable writing (translation); clear, direct, generous, encouraging advice; perfect mix of formal and not-sugar-coated opinion; fun (now) historical current examples. Short but wonderfully parsimonious (several times refers to itself as a pamphlet). Should have read it 11 years ago when I bought it! Excellent. "
5,0262681501,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7402577-dimitri-yatsenko,5,"I enjoyed reading this book immensely, although it does need to be taken with a sense of humor in places.Santiago Ramon y Cajal instructed his followers to build character in order to become fully dedicated to the task of collecting detailed data about nature and fully immersed in a narrow niche that one is studying. He cautioned against getting caught up in useless distractions: excessive theorizing, authority worship, gossip, or relationship troubles.The following quote sums up a great deal of the value system that Dr. Cajal prescribed to young scientists: ...a scholar's positive contribution is measured by the sum of the original data that he contributes. Hypotheses come and go but data remain. Theories desert us, while data defend us. They are our true resources, our real estate, and our best pedigree. In the eternal shifting of things, only they will save us from the ravages of time and from the forgetfulness or injustice of men. (Kindle Locations 934-936). Of course, the chapter on marriage and relationship advice is hilarious:For the man of science, the aid of a wife is just as necessary in youth as in old age. A woman at one's side may be likened to a knapsack in battle: without the accessory one fights unencumbered, but after the battle, then what? (Kindle Locations 1078-1079)"

Ramon y Cajal is a famous Spanish neuroscientist, often considered the father of modern neurobiology. This little book contains his advice for young scientists. It's an interesting read, though more as a snapshot of the history and sociology of science than as a source of actual career advice. Some of the advice is very interesting, but much more of it is questionable, dated, or obvious. The prose is also a little dry; I suspect it reads better in Spanish. "
7,0262681501,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4054399-pat-rondon,4,"A good read for grad students of all ages, if a bit dated. Take Ramón y Cajal at his word for developing persistence, original taste, and the importance of knowing others' work, and ignore the bits that hint at isolating yourself.

He is the father of neuroscience, we should give him the credit he deserved.In this book, he was like a father, a real sincere professor who try to pass down his manner in science researches. He asked us not to be blindly following the authority, pick up the subject that least people choose, which means the topic that most people think difficult. Think independently, stay humble all the time, focus and strong will. Tolerate the loneliness is the very important key to lead to great research, start from small lab, even suggest students to choose the right kind of wives (this part is really funny). He listed out the ""Don't be this kind of researchers..."" in a very humorous way, such as some prof profited the student to touch the devices in the lab, even needed to lock up before leaving, they should apply the job of guardian.  Of course, he taught how he did the researches as procedures: Observe, experiment, hypotheses, prove. He also suggested in this book that how senior researchers could train younger newbies. "

I mostly appreciated the emphasis on discipline.There is also lot of dated advice, but if you take this as a historical read -rather than an advice book - it turns out to be a quite interesting window into the past of science. You gain some insight on how the scientific process has changed in over a hundred years."

I genuinely enjoyed the passage on 'choosing a suitable wife' for a scientist because it was a) funny and b) a candid look at the outlook and priorities of this great figure in neuroscience. "
13,0262681501,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27737321-sophie,3,"Right when I joined the lab, I got this book from my PI (principal investigator, or My Boss), who had gotten it from his PI when he first started. I’m ashamed to say that I had never heard of Santiago Ramón y Cajal before this, but apparently he’s one of those big guys in science? This classic guide for new grad students is practical, informative, and often humorous, but probably a bit outdated given the cringe-worthy emphasis on the dominance of men in research and the supporting role of women.
Introduction
Santiago Ramón y Cajal (1852-1934) was a neuroscientist who made great contributions to the scientific community in Spain. He wrote and illustrated the first histology textbook in Spain, wrote many books (including this one!) to aid his students and colleagues in achieving productive scientific careers, won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine along with Camillo Golgi for their findings on the structures of the nervous system, and is deemed the father of neuroscience. This translation is one among many that stemmed from the original Spanish version, but the goal of translators Neely and Larry Swanson for this fourth edition of their translated work is to provide a more modern translation of the original that will remain relevant for students today.
Discussion
Advice for a Young Investigator is actually quite entertaining, given that it was written in the late 1800s when scientists were focused on doing science and not much on anything else. The flowery language that Ramón y Cajal uses amuses me greatly, and I’ve read some of these grandiose passages aloud just for the heck of it and couldn’t help bursting into giggles afterwards. Not to say that what Ramón y Cajal’s written is not inspiring, but it’s definitely just a little behind the times, haha. And some passages, like the following, led to a lot of re-reading and trying to figure out what Ramón y Cajal was trying to say…
The cajoleries of vanity, the effusions of instinct, and the caresses of fortune pale before the supreme pleasure of experiencing how the wings of the spirit emerge and develop, and how when working harmoniously we overcome difficulty to dominate and subdue elusive nature.
These extremely flowery passages with Ramón y Cajal’s great insights into what qualities an young investigator should have (concentration, passion for reputation, taste for scientific originality) as well as what he terms the “diseases of the will”, or types of people to not end up like: bibliophiles (who focus on reading everything), contemplators (who study nature for “its aesthetic qualities”, megalomaniacs (who plan more than they do), and instrument addicts (self-explanatory). The latter section was, in my opinion, the most interesting part of the book, since it reminded me of a Buzzfeed list. :D Another helpful section was on the stages of scientific research, going from observation to experimentation, making a hypothesis, and proving the hypothesis. I’m constantly surprised by how much politics there is in science nowadays, and that seems to have been the case even back in Ramón y Cajal’s time.
Far from humbling one’s self before the great authorities of science, those beginning research must understand that – by a cruel but inevitable law – their destiny is to grow a little at the expense of the great one’s reputation. It is very common for those beginning their scientific explorations with some success to do so by weakening the pedestal of an historic or contemporary hero.
The one section that really put me off about this book was on the social factors that were beneficial to scientific work. Here, Ramón y Cajal talked about the work-life balance (which was fine and dandy and is still discussed today), but also talked a lot about marriage and family life… for the man of science. Obviously, for his time period, women were not “scientists”, but I still cringe whenever I read about “the scholar’s wife.” I guess the advice that Ramón y Cajal provides that’s still relevant today is the following:
As a general rule, we advise the man inclined towards science to seek in the one whom his heart has chosen a compatible psychological profile rather than beauty and wealth. In other words, he should seek feelings, tastes, and tendencies that are to a certain extent complementary to his own.
(And then he follows that up with more cringe-worthy characteristics like “a sensitive compliance with his wishes” and a “warm and full-hearted acceptance of her husband’s view of life”, but I’m just going to ignore that part.)
Conclusion
Advice for a Young Investigator is a classic read that has been passed down from PI to grad student over the last few decades, and Ramón y Cajal’s wit and humor complemented by his extravagant narrative makes this an interesting read. However, I feel like there must be more recent works that hold the same amount of wisdom for young investigators without being sexist in the process.

20,0262681501,http://goodreads.com/user/show/74430567-matt,4,"A slim book by the grandfather of neuroscience with advice for young scientists. I was looking forward to reading this, but was anticipating 1) harsh injunctions emphasizing the need for personal sacrifice and total commitment to science (successful scientists tend to be an intense lot) and 2) the occasional anachronistic view on race, women, etc.How refreshing to run into neither of these! Ramon y Cajal comes across as intensely likable, erudite and passionate but also witty and good-natured, someone who gets a kick out of science and mentoring scientists. Sound advice abounds. Take homes include 1) hard work is far more important than intellectual ability in scientific success 2) one's primary focus, above all else, should be generating original data. Everything else will follow.Some particularly charming highlights:-So you're a newcomer to science? Buy some lab equipment and start messing around in your home. Try replicating some key published studies; once you have done this, you have established enough technical basis to start some simple novel investigations. (He even provides a lab equipment shopping list for a few different subfields in biology). -So you're a bachelor? The best wife for you, hands down, is a fellow scientist who you can share an intellectual life with as well as a home. (He makes no attempt to hide that he's a little jealous of Pierre Curie for landing Marie). All in all, a great book for beleaguered graduate students who want to get excited about science again. "
21,0262681501,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39340211-liam,3,"This book is suitable only for those beginning a career in doctoral science research (PhD), particularly biologists. This is simply not worth your time if you are of a different scientific standing (layperson, preapplicant, pregraduate, BSc, MSc, lab tech, postdoc, independent researcher, PI).I read this because for the next few years I aim to repeat and quantify what earned Ramón y Cajal the sixth ever Nobel Prize in Medicine & Physiology, but for different cells and within the human brain. I'd recommend this mainly to anatomy PhD students who will be satisfied with general as any 'career advice' guide will be to science. Ramón y Cajal's analogies, lyricism and dedication to perseverance and goodwill are commendable. He is very vague, but I think everything he writes is correct—he only writes of what he is certain, and perhaps that in itself is part of the advice he intends to give here.However, don't expect any concrete step-by-step methods, categories or strategies for experimental design, analysis or presentation. This is not a hand-holding exercise, this is a somewhat anarchic written ramble on the general nature of scientific career. The tone isn't even too serious—he emphasises patriotism and even makes marital recommendations for the male scientist. Taken lightly, these paternal elements made it more welcoming and less dry than a normal science monologue. "
22,0262681501,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18925418-charlie,3,"The book should be seen as a historic reference as it was published in 1893. The views of the author are therefore very strange and old-fashioned. (Learn German, women should assist their husband) Though I don't agree with this, I would recommend this book to every new scientist especially in the Life Science field. It is well written and the author is very passionate about being a scientist. What I didn't like about the book was how Cajal made mistakes in his own arguing. For example he argues in one chapter that in the arts it is much more difficult to find a field of research as one could never achieve what the Greeks and Romans had not achieved beforehand. For Science he however states that one should never give up just because the field is too competive and many advances have already been made. In my opinion his view of the arts is therefore invalid. He also feels that one should dedicate one mind to only a few major interest and not blunt the weapon of your mind by having too many (e.g. learning too many languages, reading too many books). I felt this was a bit extreme and to my mind the brain is able to accomplish so many things, there is no way you could clutter it up, if you will, with too much information."
23,0262681501,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25528089-efsun-annac,5,"This book is great. Let me explain why. First of all, please do not forget that it was written in 1897, and for its time this is a 'novel' book targeting graduate students or with Cajal's term ""young investigators"". Second, he tries to share all his experience and advice about how to survive as a young investigator in a complicated area, that is; Academy or any research environment. Third, he gives pieces of advice not only about how to do research but also how to cooperate or communicate with others to be able to feed your research. You may say some of his advice is too private or sometimes he is too sexist, and you might be right about it. However, conditions were completely different 120 years ago in research and you should consider every sentence he wrote was written in those times. I enjoyed this book a lot and as a ""young investigator"". I thought it is a nice and interesting journey for me from 2017 to 1897. It made me think how well we improved in science and research methods in the meantime. "
24,0262681501,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7192697-melissa,3,"Overall, I think there is a lot of wisdom in this book about how to shape the mind and life of an aspiring scientist. Sure, there were some objectionably sexist remarks in one chapter, but given the time and culture that the author wrote this in, it is at least marginally understandable. It shouldn't be a reason not to read the book. It's also interesting from a historical standpoint, to read how the scientific world functioned in the last century and to view Spain's position. I definitely will return to this book a few times over the next couple of years to see the things I marked (which was a lot!). Just a caution that it is a very dense (and often times, dry) book, so it is best enjoyed and valued a chapter (or less) at a time. "
25,0262681501,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5613105-eric,3,"I liked it, interesting to see the historical perspective and the views of a world-leading scientist ~1900. Certainly some aspects are dated, but plenty still carries through. Sort of a puzzle to try to read his language and distill it into principles applicable to the modern research field, so that was fun. Also nice to set modern research in the context of a hundred+ year old tradition. However, in spite of some humor it was a little dry and stilted compared to modern writing, which simply made it a little slower-going, less-absorbable, and less-relevant. Not the _greatest_ ROI for a young researcher, but still good reading."
26,0262681501,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30926456-goh-jiayin,5,"I really do think that Ramon y Cajal is a serious man with a kind heart. Most of his words are frank and somewhat easy to understand. It might be due to this book being a translated version. While reading this book, I have come to realise about my flaws and improvements that can be done. Besides that, it is a somewhat comforting book that tells you it's okay to make mistake as long as you learn from it. A thought provoking book indeed that make me question my place and interest in science for every turned pages. "
27,0262681501,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7453251-rohit-suratekar,3,"Cajal was a prolific researcher, this book represents his philosophy about working in science. Author explains many different aspects ranging from inspiration to do research to qualities of good investigators. Many of the qualities and situations mentioned in the book are actually significant for the period of time in Spain when author was there. Many of author's remarks are not useful in current scientific community. Nevertheless, the point raised by authors are good and convincing. "
28,0262681501,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21960395-milkiways,5,"It is a wonderful read. Cajal provided great insights from developing a research plan to the retirement. Choosing a research field, students, collaborations etc. that could align with institution's theory along with fostering personal ambitions. Even he advised on choosing an appropriate spouse, whose personality can be beneficial for research career if not an obstacle.Definitely a must read if you are considering a research career!"
29,0262681501,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3548937-darrin,5,This was an excellent book. The book was referred by an friend. It transformed my way of thought.

Topics include ""Beginner's Traps,"" ""Intellectual Qualities,"" ""Diseases of the Will,"" and ""Social Factors"" (material support, marriage and family).

31,0262681501,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3250760-chris-aldrich,4,This is certainly worth the read for the high qualities of its translation and vocabulary. There are lots of great aphorisms and brilliant bits of advice.
