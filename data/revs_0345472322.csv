0,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5808354-joshua-guest,2,"Okay, so the idea is fine, and usable, and easy to explain to others, and pretty simple. I was about to give this book a one-star rating because I was so irritated with Dr. Dweck trying to shoehorn her idea into every single success story in the history of humanity and basically saying that her theory was the best explanation of that success. Conversely, every failure could have been averted but for a change in mindset. It was the Fixed mindset that caused the Chicago Cubs to never win a World Series. If only they had the Growth mindset, like the Yankees, they would win more World Series.Dweck may be too in love with her own ideas to realize that she oversells the usefulness of her theory to the extent that the portion that is actually workable seems underwhelming after cutting away from her salesman-like puffery. However, Mindset still serves as a useful supplement to a change manager's library. Its principles are serviceable to the manager, the parent, the spouse, the student, and the teacher. Just don't mistake it for a panacea."

Not only that, but I'm pretty sure no one should require me to read a shitty waste-of time self help book.Let me save you the money and the aggrivation: The point of this book is (admittedly) not terrible, but it could be summed up real fast. Here you go, you're welcome.Often, people see their abilities as 'fixed' and this attitude stops them from working to better themselves, turns out that if you work hard and keep the right can-do attitude, that you can accomplish more than if you think you're doomed to be a particular skill level forever. There are examples of this all around you.Boom. Done. But no. What you get with this book is an endless diatribe. Hey, you remember that thing that happened in history? Where X person did Y thing that turned out to be good/bad? Well, if it was bad, it was TOTALLY because they had a fixed mindset. If it was good, it was 100% because of their growth mindset. This is true of literally any example in history ever no matter how poorly researched it might be. Is there any scientific basis for these historical claims? Absolutely not. Michael Jordan? SURE THING. That guy from that one business that went bad? WHAT A FIX MINDED DUMBASS. Bethoven? Duh. Seriously, I don't think I have ever read something so repetitive and belabored in my life. Sure, lady, you make a good point: People shouldn't limit themselves. Maybe give it a break after about 15 pages and I think it would probably be plenty.Also, if you tell me that I wouldn't be depressed if I just had a better attitude about it, I'm going to be upset and lose faith in your credibility. Seriously, kids, don't waste your time on this. And if your boss tells you to read it, don't bother, just read this helpful review again."
2,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/579294-cerealflakes,2,"I keep hearing educators praising this author and, specifically, this book. Maybe she's better in person. I found this book trite. It was very repetitive and full of cherry picked stories pulled out just to prove her obvious conclusion. Are there really people who think that if you go into something with a negative attitude it won't affect the outcome? She goes to the extreme with the positive attitude stuff, though. I just don't buy that anyone can do anything if they just try hard enough. Not trying guarantees you won't do it, but trying really hard doesn't mean you will. Lots of people try hard for years to get into the Olympics and they don't. It doesn't mean that they didn't work as hard as someone who did. The author also inserted herself pretty aggressively into this book. Her story about tears streaming down her face at the wonderfulness of Italians was too much. This book is dated enough that her stories of the greatness of Tiger Woods is pretty funny. I found Malcolm Gladwell's Outliers to be a much better book about a similar topic."

Disappointing, I know, I have been there. Perhaps, such way of thinking and having such beliefs about IQ and talent is the biggest hurdle in the way of great success and achievement. Thinking that we are born with a pre-determined IQ and talent, is called fixed-mindset according to Carol Dweck, a professor at Stanford University. The bad news is that people with fixed-mindset live a mediocre life and barely achieve anything extraordinary. The good news, however, is that you can readily change your fixed-mindset and adopt a growth-mindset which is the default mode thinking of world-class achievers.In this book review, I will provide a summary of the key points in the book “Mindset: The psychology of success”. In addition, I will provide you with practical insights on how you can apply the concepts in the book and alter this self-limiting belief. So, let’s learn how to think like pros.The two mindsets and how they determine your futureDweck, as a young researcher, has always been obsessed with understanding how people cope with failure. So, at schools, she brings children into a room and gives them a series of puzzles to solve. Puzzles start from fairly easy and continue to get harder and harder. As the students grunt, perspire and toil, she watches their strategies. This is where she gets shocked by the two starkly different approaches children adopted when facing difficult challenges.Confronted with harder puzzles, one ten-year-old pulls up his chair, rubs his hands together, smacks his lips, and cries out, “I love a challenge! Another, seating away on the puzzles, looks up with a pleased expression and says with authority, “You know, I was hoping this would be informative!” As Dweck puts it: What’s wrong with them? I wondered. I always thought you coped with failure or you didn’t cope with failure. I never thought anyone loved failure. Were these alien children or were they on to something? These children turned out to be thinking with a growth-mindset. A person with a growth mindset believes that human qualities, such as intellectual skills, can be cultivated through effort. Having this belief, not only they do not get discouraged by failure, they don’t even think they are failing. Rather, they think that they are learning, and consequently, they get smarter!The superpower of people with growth-mindset is that they have the confidence and courage to start and accomplish anything; and they do accomplish because, in the face of many inevitable failures, they are not discouraged. They do not say to themselves I am a failure, rather, they say I failed. Hence, they persevere, and they will triumph at the task.People with a fixed-mindset, on the other hand, think that human qualities are carved in stone. You are smart or you are not, and failure means you are not. The sad story for people with fixed-mindset is that the try to avoid failure at all costs, so they can stay (feel) smart. Struggles, mistakes, perseverance are just not part of their philosophy.Why do people differThe question that arises here, is why some people are endowed with a growth-mindset, while the others are doomed with the fixed-mindset. The answer is in their childhood upbringing and it is really simple.Imagine you are given a puzzle and you solve it. Now your parent sees your accomplishment. This is where the seeds to glory or mediocrity get implanted. If your parent praised you in the lines of: Look, what a smart boy/girl …You are so intelligent, excellent … Sorry to tell, but you are doomed if you have heard similar praises during your childhood. Such complements may come from your parents, teachers, caretakers, the source doesn’t really matter. But wait for a second, aren't such praises suppose to uplift your spirit and raise your confidence? Well, let's see what happens behind the curtain (in your subconscious mind) when you are complimented on a trait, over which you have not direct control (in this case, IQ and intelligence).Imagine you have solved a puzzle and received a juicy complement hinting on you high IQ or intelligence. Now, you are given a harder puzzle, you strive to solve it, but, you notice it is taking much more time. This is where the self-limiting seeds start to grow. In your subconscious you will start a self-dialog along these lines: hmm, wasn’t I a smart boy/girl, why am I not able to solve this puzzle then??? Hmm, maybe this is just how smart I am. My intelligence is limited to those tasks only … From then on, you will be very conservative of the activities you will get yourself into for the sake of preserving your self-esteem. Too bad! Don’t freak out though if you are in this category, I will share with you how you can easily change this self-limiting mindset as we proceed. Now, let’s see how children are endowed with the growth mindset.Imagine, again, the very same scenario, you solve a problem and now it is time for some praises … Your parent, instructor, while marveling at your accomplishments, says: Hmm, good job, this might have been an easy puzzle, let’s do something more challenging…orHmm, good job, you seem to have worked so hard, let’s move on to a harder puzzle. Take note that in the second scenario, there is no emphasis on an innate trait, rather, the praise is on something which is you have control over, that is, your efforts and how hard you work.Now let’s examine your self-dialog as you face the new harder challenge. When you try to solve the puzzle and it takes time more than the usual, if you could play your subconscious mind’s voice a little louder, you would hear:Hmm, I have not yet solved it, I have not tried enough, I must work harder on it, it is exciting.You see the difference? How do I know if I have fixed-mindset or growth-mindsetThe cornerstone of change is to first acknowledge that a shortcoming exist. So, to uncover if you have the fixed or growth-mindset, read the sentences below:Our intelligence is something very basic about you that you can’t change very much.You can learn new things, but you can’t really change how intelligent you are.No matter how much intelligence you have, you can always change it quite a bit.You can always substantially change how intelligent you are.If you agree more with the sentences 1, and 2, you are mostly behaving and operating with a fixed-mindset, and if you identify yourself with sentences 3, and 4, you operating with a growth-mindset.When asked people, ranging from children to young adults: When Do You Feel Smart: When you are flawless or when you are learning? Here are how differently people with a fixed-mindset replied:It’s when I don’t make any mistakes.When I finish something fast and it’s perfect.When Something is easy for me but other people can’t do it.And this is how people with growth-mindset replied: When it’s really hard, and I try really hard, and I can do something I couldn’t do before.When I work on something for a long time and I start to figure it out.See the difference? Which set of answers resonates most with you?There was a saying in 1960 which read: “Becoming is better than being”. The fixed-mindset robs people from the luxury of becoming. They have to already be. Mindset in relationshipsMindsets manifest themselves in every domain, whether you are a leader, teacher, parent, or a husband/wife. I chose relationship since I guess there are lots of myths around this topic (we all once craved to find our one true soulmate I guess), and also you must beware that even people with growth-mindset, might approach a domain like relationships with fixed-mindset.People with fixed-mindset think that if their relationship is the right one, and if they are compatible with one another, well, this means most things will fall into its place. In the face of problems, they tremble and threads of doubts and fears start to sneak in.People with fixed-mindset say if this is the right relationship and if we are compatible, there must be no need for hustle and hard work to get it to work. Remember the delusions sparked by the fixed-mindset? “If you have the ability, then you shouldn’t work hard for it”.Aaron Beck, noted marriage authority, says that one of the most destructive beliefs for a relationship is “If we need to work at it, there’s something seriously wrong with our relationship.” Says John Gottman, a foremost relationship researcher:Every marriage demands an effort to keep it on the right track; there is a constant tension . . . between the forces that hold you together and those that can tear you apart.As with personal achievement, this belief—that success should not need effort—robs people of the very thing they need to make their relationship thrive. It’s probably why so many relationships go stale—because people believe that being in love means never having to do anything taxing.How do I go from fixed-mindset to growth-mindsetIn this section, I share with you how you can adopt a growth mindset. Congrats, we have already taken the first step by shedding the light on these two modes of thinking. Regardless of these further steps, the sheer awareness of these two mindsets takes you a long way, but, it may not be enough.One way which is a profoundly effective way to instill the growth-mindset is studying the lives of great performers, and world-known figures like Michael Jordan, Mozart, Michelangelo, etc. Why, you might ask. The reason is that when you study the lives of such achievers, you will notice a common theme in their life story and that it, “hard work”, and not talent or IQ. While people marveled at the Pietà masterpiece, this is how the wizard, Michelangelo responded:If people knew how hard I worked to get my mastery, it wouldn't seem so wonderful at all...For practical insights refer to:  Growth Mindset vs Fixed Mindset"
4,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5564496-jamie-doerschuck,1,"I think a lot of people who rated this book highly must have had a ""fixed mindset"".I think this book was a waste of money, personally. The tone of the book is very repetitive and annoying. Essentially people with a growth mindset are better than people without it in every possible way. If you have a fixed mindset you'll have lower grades in school, be unhappier, die earlier, be fatter, (be more likely to) never get married, make a bundle less money, you name it! It reads more like fear mongering than actual research, rattling off a list of everyone's most basic fears ""But if you listen to me, Carol Dweck, all of your dreams and more will come true!"".I also don't recall Dweck listing many references to any of her research, you're just supposed to take her stories at face value ""Because I'm a researcher!"". Mindset offers a lot of words with little substance. I will admit that I haven't finished the book, and I don't plan to. Dweck's tone really just grated on my nerves, and I don't feel I gained anything useful from reading what parts of the book I read. I can't imagine anything more useful coming to light at the end."
5,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1112254-michael,5,"Excellent book. This one sounds like a typical self-help book, but it's a real find. The author is a pyschology researcher at Columbia, and her book is filled with insights and illustrations regarding the differences that a fixed mindset vs. a growth mindset can have when applied to business, parenting, school, and relationships. Her research has been highlighted in many venues, including an excellent book on parenting titled Nurture Shock. I give it 5 stars because I can see so much of myself in the book's description of the fixed mindset. The book's message spoke to me and the mindset I've adopted in some areas of my life. I'm particularly prone to the ""Effort Gone Awry"" scenario where I would work hard, but not with a growth mindset (i.e., one associated with the love of learning). Rather, I'd be working hard to prove myself to others. I worked hard to have achievements that would validate my self worth and adopted identity. The downside is that you end up being unwilling to take risks or face tough challenges (if you fail, your self worth goes down). Also, you end up running yourself ragged and being stressed out because you're afraid of losing the approval of others if you don't succeed.I find the growth mindset fits very well within a Christian perspective as our life in God needs to be always one of continual growth -- ""higher up and deeper in"" as C.S. Lewis would say. The fixed vs. growth mindset isn't the whole story, but it's an important part of the puzzle in helping us better understand how our minds work. I like the diagram on p.245 that I believe sums up the message of the book.Fixed Mindset:-E.g., Intelligence is staticLeads to a desire to look smart and therefore a tendency to...Challenges: avoid challengesObstacles: get defensive or give up easilyEffort: see effort as fruitless or worseCriticism: ignore useful negative feedbackSuccess of others: feel threatened by the success of others=> As a result, they may plateau early and achieve less than their full potentialGrowth Mindset:-E.g., Intelligence can be developedLeads to a desire to learn and therefore a tendency to...Challenges: embrace challengesObstacles: persist in the face of setbacksEffort: see effort as the path to masteryCriticism: learn from criticismSuccess of others: find lessons and inspiration in the success of others=> As a result, they reach ever-higher levels of achievementThese basic questions are also helpful in developing a growth mindset.I need to continually ask myself:-What are the opportunities for learning and growth today? For myself? For the people around me?As I think of opportunities and form a plan, I need to ask:When, where, and how will I embark on my plan?As I encounter difficulties, I need to ask:When, where, and how will I act on my new plan?And when you succeed, ask yourself:What do I have to do to maintain and continue the growth?"
6,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5048121-becca,1,"It's pretty bad when after 15 pages, I want to fling a book away in disgust. But I kept reading. (Okay, it turned into skimming pretty quickly). And it DIDN'T GET BETTER. I've read several thoughtful and interesting pieces of journalism lately referencing the general thesis of this book that were really thought provoking. But the book itself is just empty tripe and cliches, without adding any content of interest to bolster the general idea that it's more important to foster a growth mindset over a static mindset in people, so that they can better cope with and adapt to situations in which they are not just naturally talented. I'm actually very sympathetic to this general idea, but the book was just terribly written, and in fact made me wonder if I should rethink my agreement with her. Here is just a small sampling of ridiculousness that is within the pages of this book:- A section is literally begun with the words ""Since the dawn of time."" Your average ninth grader should be aware that this is a terrible idea.- An extensive summary of the movie ""Groundhog's Day"" is given as support for a theory of psychology.- Half the book is filled with ""interesting trivia"" that suggest that people who begin stupid can work hard and be AMAZING!!! For example, did you know people thought Einstein was slow as a child?! - Yes, everybody knows that piece of faux-trivia. And it's not even true - real evolutionary psychologists believe that Einstein's brain was larger than average in areas that encourage spatial reasoning and an intuitive grasp of numbers. (Steven Pinker told me that in _The Blank Slate_. After about three pages of this book, it was not hard to decide which author I find more credible.)- So many ridiculous cliches (introduced as ARGUMENTS and EVIDENCE) that it would be impossible to catalogue them all. This book is practically an encyclopedia of phrases like ""nothing ventured, nothing gained!"" and ""if at first you don't succeed, try, try again.""- The explanations of the research projects that created these ""findings"" make it obvious that you cannot trust these results. For instance, they presented kindergarteners with a test that they said was ""very important."" Before administering the test, they asked followup questions of the five year olds: ""Do you think this test will measure how smart you are?"" and ""Do you think this test will measure how smart you will be as a grown-up?"" Almost all of them said yes, except for one five year old I am certain is fictional, who responded ""No way! Ain't no test that can measure that!"" If you ask a FIVE YEAR OLD an extremely leading question who has been given no information, you are almost guaranteed to get a shower of ""yes!"" answers. The fact that they didn't immediately display suspiciousness toward researchers and critically deconstruct their questions is evidence of nothing. At best, it's evidence that children respond to leading questions and/or don't listen and think very deeply or carefully when asked leading questions.- There is one section that is full of reports about ""genius children"" to suggest that some of them turned out well (the ones who still applied hard work) and some who didn't (because they just rested on their natural proclivities). All of these stories feel impossible to believe the way they are presented. The author read a book once that told a story about a four month old baby who asked his parents ""Mom and Dad, what are we eating for dinner tonight?"" This is third-hand, not cited, and completely un-credible. (Even if a baby was genius enough to speak in full sentences at four months old, he cannot eat solid food yet, so why on earth does he care what they are making for dinner?).In short, this might be the worst book I've ever read. Before reading it, I was very persuaded by its premise. After reading it and discovering that at least this explanation of the thesis is the opposite of convincing, I will approach all writers who accept this theory with a huge degree of distrust and suspicion. "
7,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1472086-stark,4,"This is probably all i really need to hear out of this book, but i will read the whole thing anyway. there are two mindsets. fixed and growth.Believing that your qualities are carved in stone -- the fixed mindset -- creates an urgency to prove yourself over and over. If you have only a certain amount of intelligence, a certain personality, and a certain moral character -- well, then you'd better prove you have a healthy dose of them. It simply wouldn't do to look or feel deficient in these most basic characteristics. ...I've seen so many people with this one consuming goal of proving themselves -- in the classroom, in their careers, and in their relationships. Every situation calls for a confirmation of their intelligence, personality, or character. Every situation is evaluated: Will I succeed or fail? Will I look smart or dumb? Will I be accepted or rejected? Will I feel like a winner or a loser?...There's another mindset in which these traits are not simply a hand you're dealt and have to live with, always trying to convince yourself and others that you have a royal flush when you are secretly worried it's a pair of tens. In this mindset, the hand you're dealt is just the starting point for development. This growth mindset is based on the belief that your basic qualities are things you can cultivate through your efforts. ...Do people with this mindset believe that anyone can be anything, that anyone with proper motivation or education can become Einstein or Beethoven? No, but they believe that a person's true potential is unknown (and unknowable); that's its impossible to forsee what can be accomplished with years of passion, toil, and training.""a person's true potential is unknown (and unknowable)"" i feel like those words contain so much freedom for both those who have been made crazy by high expectations in their upbringing, and put down with low ones. it is not a knowable thing, what your potential is, anyone who told you they knew, it was a lie, and you have nothing to prove and nothing to hide? what a relief"
8,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1-otis-chandler,4,"Recommended in Stanford Magazine and by Guy Kawasaki.A very useful book about the growth mindset. Essentially, the book makes a case that those people who look at everything they do in life as a learning opportunity are much more successful. I think where this comes into play most often is when we face a setback, or a failure. Whether thats getting rejected from something (a job, a team, etc), messing up at work, having your boss yell at you, losing at something, getting laid off, making a bad bet, etc - most of us have many setbacks in our lives. How we deal with those is incredibly important. If we let the setback define us, we might think we aren't talented after all, and lose confidence. If on the other hand, we look at it as something we can learn from, we improve as a person.I came at the book as it was recommended to me as being good for parents. My daughter is only 1.6 years, but already she is learning fast. The book recommends praising our children's efforts, instead of their results. Telling them they are ""amazing"", and ""smart"" is so easy to do, but if you do that their whole lives they won't succeed when they get to the real world. What you want is to encourage a learning attitude. This quote sums it up: ""So what should we say when children complete a task—say, math problems—quickly and perfectly? Should we deny them the praise they have earned? Yes. When this happens, I say, “Whoops. I guess that was too easy. I apologize for wasting your time. Let’s do something you can really learn from!""Looking at life as a constant challenge is fun. And you can't fail at a personal challenge! Here is a great mental imagery technique the book mentioned when you are doing something you are bad at:""Picture your brain forming new connections as you meet the challenge and learn. Keep on going.""Another interesting bit was how people at the top of their game can get caught up in a fixed mindset. You see this in sports all the team - the champion team from last year thinks they can cruise through this year, doesn't work hard, and suddenly they are losing a lot. It's so hard to maintain the edge. John Wooden puts it best:""I believe ability can get you to the top,” says coach John Wooden, “but it takes character to keep you there.… It’s so easy to … begin thinking you can just ‘turn it on’ automatically, without proper preparation. It takes real character to keep working as hard or even harder once you’re there. When you read about an athlete or team that wins over and over and over, remind yourself, ‘More than ability, they have character.'"""

Hooray you are a special snowflake that can grow!Heavy on the inspirational stories and antidotes, light on the data to support some of the arguments and essentially void of the how to. I agree that the right attitude, one that embraces struggle and hard work in order to increase your talents (which are not fixed, but fluid), helps you succeed in life. But it's about putting ideas into action. This book offers very little practical advice or steps one can take in order to do so. I think most people, after reading this, get that warm fuzzy feeling that wow, this makes sense! But then that fades, and life resumes, and it's just a book on the shelf. Maybe even a companion book to put this idea into action to train the elephant in you (thanks Happiness Hypothesis).Ultimately, success requires the right attitude but also the sweat to make it happen. And this doesn't really offer practical steps on how to make it happen. There ain't no short cut.Studies that debunk this book:http://communityconnectors.ohio.gov/P... (read the abstract page one)"
10,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2018505-thomas,3,"Great overarching concept, lackluster execution. In Mindset, Professor of Psychology Carol S. Dweck discusses the difference between a fixed mindset and a growth mindset. The fixed mindset focuses on immovable measures of achievement and ability, such as the idea that everyone is born with a certain amount of unchangeable intelligence. The growth mindset advocates that everyone can improve themselves in any area of life through hard work. Dweck argues that we should adapt the growth mindset because it aids in parenting, academics, relationships, and more.As a Psychology major I learned about growth and fixed mindsets in my classes, and it was cool to see Dweck apply the concepts to several different areas, such as sports, marriage, and politics. However, I wish she had done more with her main argument: instead of delving deeper into the psychology behind the mindsets, it felt like she stayed at the surface level of her ideas and applied them to a wide range of interesting yet repetitive anecdotes. She could have connected growth and fixed mindsets to mental health, stereotype threat, feminism, or an assortment of other topics that would have strengthened the thesis of her book.After 276 pages, I did not feel like I learned anything new. It's not like anything Dweck wrote was wrong or bad, but I could capture her main argument and share it with people just by having them read an article or two, as opposed to this entire book."
11,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5868753-alex,2,"Another book that attempts to build upon the research of Anders Ericsson.The way I read it, I would break the book into 3 parts:Part 1: How people fail because they don't have the right mindsetPart 2: How people success because they have the right mindsetPart 3: You could also call this part 2a - it basically deals with children and success in school, home, etc.The first part of the book was the worst. Its case after case of ""this person tried to succeed and failed because he didn't have the right mindset"". Great. So what was the right mindset? She doesn't tell you. How do you obtain it, or get into that mindset? She doesn't tell you. She tells you whats wrong without explaining WHY it is wrong, etc. She sorta reserves that for the next part of the book. Also, there is no form. Its kind of a rambling, unorganized mess. You read it and are wondering ""Ok, this person failed, that person failed. They didn't have the right mindset. Do you mind explaining to me what the right mindset ACTUALLY IS? How a bout how do *I* get the right mindset so I can avoid all this?"" Some of those questions never get answered.The second part of the book has all these success stories, and she tells you that they were successful because they had the right mindset. She delves slightly into what the right mindset is, but there really aren't a new revelations here. And she never tells you how to get into that mindset. IOW, there is nothing in the book about motivation (intrinsic or extrinsic). There is nothing about background and upbringing or lessons learn earlier in life. There is no compare and contrast with the first part of the book to bring things into a proper context.IOW, shes not teaching you about mindset, shes just telling you. Thanks. Its like describing to someone how the piano is played vs actually giving someone lessons.If you are interested in this type of material, check out Geoffry Colvin's ""Talent Is Overrated"" and Matthew Sayid's ""Bounce"" - preferably in that order. Read it and you will see all that this book is missing. And though Colvin's book can get dry at time, it still has forward movement, and ideas build upon previous ones, and things are explained very well. All things that this one is lacking."

While reading something else recently, it referred to this one and I decided to give it a go. The basic premise is that ""the view you adopt for yourself profoundly affects the way you lead your life.""""Believing that your qualities are carved in stone - the fixed mindset - creates and urgency to prove yourself over and over. If you have only a certain amount of intelligence, a certain personality, and a certain moral character - well, then you'd better prove that you have a healthy dose of them. It simply wouldn't do to look or feel deficient in these most basic characterstics.""""The growth mindset is based on the belief that your basic qualities are things you can cultivate through your efforts. Although many people may differ in every which way - in their initial talents and aptitudes, interests or temperaments - everyone can change and grow through application and experience.""I've done some soul searching on myself, because I can certainly be angst-ridden and defensive. However, no matter how terribly I've failed, I have always tried again. I am a firm believer that there is no such thing as talent, only practice. It wasn't just Malcolm Gladwell who convinced me of this. I went to an elite highschool. We were all told we were smart, but that that would not put us through - only effort would. The growth mindset cultivated in my class led to many remarkable achievements. I had already cultivated good study habits, and these saw me through. I was more interested in learning than in being the best - the latter would have been futile in the group I was in anyway.The psychology classes of those highschool years taught me about IQ tests and the difficulty of measuring such a thing because of biases. It also taught me that most of the things measured could be learned. The IQ tests I have taken prove as much. I excel at langauge, anagrams, visual patterns and numbers - these are things I have practiced. I suck at logic. I never really attempted to learn it in the theory of knowledge classes either, but I could have and could still.When I was appointed my first management position, I read. When I got more responsibility and felt overwhelmed, I went back to part-time school and took a semester of work and organization psychology. This also involved some very specific things around Norwegian employment law, in addition to learning more about how people react to different situations. These classes were incredibly helpful. If I had had a fixed mindset, I would probably not have put so much effort into learning how to be a better boss having believed my traits and talents fixed. But I'm not done, and I never will be - there are always more things to learn.Lately I've become better at recognizing destructive thought patterns and tweaking my reactions. This is cognitive psychology, something this author doesn't seem to hold high in regard. However, the cognitive psychology I have been reading focuses much on behavior. If you want to live a more healthy lifestyle, start behaving like you are. Get your ass out of the sofa. And so forth. I find that the cognitive approach and the growth mindset go hand in hand.When things go to hell, don't take it personally but do accept personal responsibility for it. Learn what you can, move on and do better next time. Take it from me, the biggest screw up contain the biggest potential lessons.There is no talent. There is only effort and practice."

Dweck(original review, 2006)Following the footsteps of someone who is great in order to be great is moronic. Only talentless fools would look to do the same as others to be successful. The only way to succeed is by doing what you love and get obsessed by it. You will be working over 100 hours a week, and you will be thinking about it every second awake, and you will be a success because nobody loves it as much as you do. It is like when you get with a girl that you love and it doesn't matter how pretty people say other’s girls are in comparison to yours; it is yours the most beautiful in your eyes."
14,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59094974-ladan,3,"It is easy to follow the first 150 pages of the book in which the writer who is an accentuated Stanford professor presents the outcome of her research accompanied by tangible instances in various fields. I enjoy her honest confession of her flawed grammar through the very first pages. It makes her like one of those problem-solver types who yield to anyone who is obsessed with correcting others.While talking about her big experience with examining kids’ reactions to failure, it reminded me of my 2-year-old niece who strives for her independence and doing anything on her own. I assume that kids are one of the best sources to learn and approach anything in a novel way.Dweck categorizes people into having two kinds of mindsets, albeit it is feasible that one would have a mixture of both mindsets.1. The growth mindset, which promises one to learn and improve in any desired field.2. The fixed mindset, which leads to frustration and anxiety.The growth mindset insists that humans are capable of improving their intelligence and abilities. People having this mindset have high self-esteem and believe in themselves since they know that if they try hard enough and spend ample time they will improve. The striving and improvement are what matter the most to people bearing this mindset, thus they enjoy the journey of challenge and progress not the moment of achievement. On the other hand, people holding a fixed mindset define themselves with what they achieve and if they do not succeed, it demeans them to nothing. Their self-esteem is highly tied to the result of their actions. However, growth mindset people value their effort, creativity and strategies rather than the outcome. They make opportunities out of their failures and challenge themselves each day to carve a better version of themselves. Unfortunately, fixed mindset people who are mostly perfectionists would go for doing repetitive tasks just in case to escape facing the risk of failure. Challenges and trying new things for them equals the probability of failure and being judged. They presume that if you are born with a gift there is no need for putting effort into work!It is possible for the growth mindset people to get frustrated after failure or even feel depressed, though they would still be functional. Therefore, talent is by no means something to be proud of, instead, the effort and courage to take risks are of high value. Yet they are realistic enough to be aware of that trying hard does not guarantee success, the novel strategies that you use creatively to improve matter the most. They know that there are many other factors, which may influence achieving a goal or not achieving it, i.e financial status, network, education level, and different available resources, which significantly affect how much effort one should put into work.Regardless of what mindset one has been holding up to now, it is recommended to consciously take the road to a growth mindset. This mindset makes it easy to enjoy spending time on what one loves and one may accordingly prosper in something never planned for.Fixed mindset types owe their success to their talent and innate abilities, no matter how hard they try, it is always a matter of innate gift, you have it or not, you were born with it or not. There are numerous examples provided through the book in almost every field, introducing world-class gurus, describing their mindset and their approaches in order to clarify how the growth and fixed mindset work. The upshot of studies investigating three types of corporates and their mindsets is very informative:1. The average corporates upgraded to high-level ones, which sustain their status2. The average corporates improved to a high-level but degraded to their previous status3. The corporates, which had no improvement at all through the time of probingBear in mind that the resources available to these corporates were almost similar and the only distinguishing difference between them was their mindset. I found the examples provided in chapter 5 so tangible and applicable, especially for managers and leaders. They are constructive and illuminate the role of a leader, who is supposed to guide the system and simultaneously learn and educate him/herself with the staff and produce a feeling of belonging among the staff. This so reminded me of Jordan Belford in wolf of wall street movie and how strongly his staff felt belonged. In hard times, this feeling won’t let them even think about quitting, instead it motivates them to improve the circumstances and be more committed and feel more responsible to solve the problems. The feeling of belonging leads to a feeling of being supported regardless of the result. Systems holding a growth mindset act more humanely because they don’t consider one to act like a machine and do exactly what he is told to achieve the desired goal. However, in a fixed mind system chances are that people act unethically to prove themselves (since they are only measured by the outcome) and remain safe and secure from being judged. In these systems, one may easily be belittled, insulted or even omitted due to failure, however in a system holding a growth mindset people are allowed to take risks and creatively take new approaches to handle the situation. This may still turn into failure but they value the improvement and effort.Discussing the relationships in chapter 6, Dweck puts the emphasis on the art of communication and suggests that one should cease the expectancy of others to be mind readers. She believes lack of actual communication skills is the origin of misunderstandings and advises that one should put time and effort into a relationship to make it work. In order to figure out our mindset, it is better to check the features of each mindset in our behaviours and approaches. If we are defensive, inflexible to change and always looking for excuses and someone to blame and consider ourselves as victims of the circumstances, we hold a fixed mindset which can only provide us with the abovementioned alibies to escape the responsibility and imprison us in our comfort zone. On the other hand, if we strive for improvement and learning and are embrace new challenges just for the sake of growth we have a growth mindset. The last chapter which seems to be added recently claims to provide one with approaches to alter the fixed mindset. After all, I found the book somehow too long and repetitive yet informative! "

Should be required reading for parents and educators, but everyone can benefit--even if you aren't really on the prowl for 'success'. What I love most is that the concept will improve yourself, but even if you struggle to change your mindset from 'fixed' to 'growth' you can instill benefits on others by praising work rather than talent.If you've ever praised someone for being 'smart' or destined to be the 'next Mozart' or a 'natural' you'll realize that you've inadvertently wrecked havoc on their psyche. As victims of this type of praise, you'll learn how to change your mindset after being damaged. Of course the book is much more than that, but those segments were the most life-changing for me.

I am only on page 43 but I already have dismissed the ideas and the author as superficial. Written in a casual style (the author states in the introduction: ""A little note about grammar. I know it and I love it, but I haven't always followed it in this book. I start sentences with ands and buts. I end sentences with prepositions. I use the plural they in contexts that require the singular he or she. I've done this for imformality and immediacy, and I hope that the sticklers will forgive me.""Well, I have a hard time forgiving that when this had to pass through professional copy editors (it's published by Ballentine). But even worse is the informality of the anecdotes and conclusions.Her thesis is that there are two types of people in the world, those with a ""fixed mindset"" and those with a ""growth mindset."" The former believe that their intelligence and ability are ""fixed"" and there is no opportunity to become smarter or more able. So why try. Do what you are already good at and avoid situations where you might possibly fail or do worse than expected. Growth-minded people believe that failure is an opportunity to grow.That's it. There's the book. Fluffed up with superficial renderings of true life stories and supposed quotes from the author's research subjects.While the author has 239 footnotes at the back of the book, backing up her statements, her stories come off as simplistic to the extreme. The most disturbing example so far is that of the late chef, Bernard Loiseau. The author claims he committed suicide because he had a fixed mindset and could not accept that his restaurant lost a ""star"" in the leading restaurant guide in Europe. ""...the director of the GaultMillau (the restaurant guide) said it was unimaginable that their rating could have taken his life. But in the fixed mindset, it is imaginable. The lower rating gave him a new definition of himself: Failure. Has-been.""It's striking what counts as failure in the fixed mindset. So, on a lighter note...""Here the author has taken a complex situation and reduced it to ""guy killed himself because he was one of my two types of people in the world."" And then blythely moves on to ""a lighter note.""A quick look at Wikipedia shows that there was more to the story than that. There were known factors such as debt. And any thinking person would tell you there are other underlying factors that could have been involved such as clinical depression, bi-polar disorder, possibly drug or alcohol abuse, childhood abuse or neglect issues, the list goes on. The point is, the author chose to simplify in a way that simply makes her point.I'm still reading this book because it makes me actually angry and I feel I need to review it for my administrators to let them know my thoughts."

Such a simple sentiment ought to be a no-brainer; and yet, how often have we let opportunities slip through our grasp because of the way we think, what we believe, or what we uphold as valuable?In MINDSET, Carol Dweck shares her research on that particular part of the brain and how it affects the way we live our lives and approach our goals. Using powerful examples, Dweck shows how too much praise of a child's intelligence or making too much of an employee's innovation can be just as bad as saying too little or nothing at all. She goes on to show how just a simple change in the way we think about the brain - in the way we THINK! - can make us lovers of learning and more resilient in the way we approach our lives, our work, our education - even our relationships!I worked at GE during the Jack Welch years, so it's not at all surprising to see him extolled here as a mindset model. Welch was a tough boss, but he was always hardest on himself. He was a straight shooter who owned up to his mistakes, actively sought to improve the way he did his job, and always - perhaps because he had come up through the ranks himself - went back to the employees, whom he considered to be the experts, for input and advice on how to make the company a better place.MINDSET is nothing new to me. Dweck's down-to-earth presentation of it here, though, is a welcome refresher and an inspiring read. Suffering from mindset? This book's for you!"

That certainly raised my expectations, and I'm happy to report that I wasn't disappointed.The premise of the book is the basis of cognitive psychology: what you believe affects your whole life, so if you can change your beliefs, ie, your mindset, you can change your life. This book characterizes two mindsets, the fixed and the growth-oriented. The fixed is the more common one because that's what society tends to drill into us. Natural talent necessarily brings success. If you're talented, you shouldn't have to work hard, and if you fail, then you just weren't as talented as you thought you were. The growth mindset is the opposite. Hard work is more important to success than talent, and when you fail, you just have to plan a better strategy for success. The book goes on to show applications of both mindsets in sports, business, relationships, education, and parenting. And the stories cited paint human portraits. My favorites were the contrast between fixed mindset John McEnroe vs. growth mindset Tiger Woods. And I'm not even into sports! It didn't matter; the point is the psychology.The author acknowledges that it's not easy to rid yourself of the fixed mindset. But since reading this book, I'm vigilant on myself. And most of all I try and remember its most important lesson: if at first you don't succeed, try, try again. "
20,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7198893-jonathan-karmel,2,"I read the first few chapters but then ended up skimming the rest. I absolutely agree with the author that it's better to have a growth mindset than a fixed mindset. It just seemed like the author made the point and then kept repeating it over and over again. I did think it was valuable to apply this principle to relationships (chapter 6); it's nice to have someone confirm that good relationships are a lot of hard work and that if a relationship requires a great deal effort that does not mean that you failed to find your true love.While having a growth mindset is a prerequisite to success, I don't personally think changing your mindset is the greatest impediment to success. I think a lot of people believe they could succeed, but they feel like they lack the motivation and energy to make the effort to do things that are really difficult. They feel like they should do things but then feel guilty about not doing them. By the way, I'd be interested to know how the author squares her theory with the section of the The Feeling Good Handbook by David Burns that explains why you should stop “must”-erbating. It seems like a person who tried to take Dweck's advice to heart would spend a lot of time feeling like they ""should"" be doing things to grow, and might also feel awful that they are not actually doing all of the things that they feel that they should be doing.Also, many, many people are constantly making a tremendous effort to grow but still feel as if they are failing. They are in fact expending effort ineffectively and are extremely frustrated. Is the problem for most people really that they do not have a growth mindset, or rather that they just can't figure out exactly what they need to do to grow?"

So what is the difference? I really enjoyed this book which addresses this question head on. Carol S. Dweck is a Stanford University psychologist who has spent decades of research on achievement and success. In the end the differing factor for her came down to the concept of mindset. Do you have a fixed mindset or a growth mindset? This book was recommended to me by the headmaster of my son's school. She recommended it to all of the parents for their children to foster their academic success. I found the author's findings to be helpful and revelatory, though I wasn't crazy about the writing.

Many people take what they like about themselves and call it a “growth mindset.” If they’re open-minded or flexible, they say they have a growth mindset. I often hear people calling it an “open mindset.” But there’s a difference between being flexible or open-minded and being dedicated to growing talent.2. Many people believe that a growth mindset is only about effort, especially praising effort. The first important thing to remember here is that the process includes more than just effort. Certainly, we want children to appreciate the fruits of hard work. We don’t want them to just try harder with the same ineffective strategy.And we want them to ask for help or input from others when it’s needed. This is the process we want them to appreciate: hard work, trying new strategies, and seeking input from others.3. A growth mindset equals telling kids they can do anything.But it doesn’t happen by simply telling them, “You can do anything.” It happens by helping them gain the skills and find the resources to make progress toward their goals. Otherwise, it’s an empty reassurance. It puts the onus entirely on the children and may make them feel like a failure if they don’t reach their goals.One final word about putting the onus on the studentSome educators and coaches were blaming kids for having a fixed mindset scolding or criticizing them for not displaying growth-mindset qualities.“I can’t teach this child. He has a fixed mindset.” Let’s be totally clear here. Teachers and educators must take seriously our responsibility to create growth-mindset-friendly environments where kids feel safe from judgment, where they understand that we believe in their potential to grow, and where they know that we are totally dedicated to collaborating with them on their learning. We are in the business of helping kids thrive, not finding reasons why they can’t.Some people think they always had fixed mindset Although for simplicity Author talked as though some people have a growth mindset and some people have a fixed mindset, in truth we’re all a mixture of the two. There’s no point denying it. Sometimes we’re in one mindset and sometimes we’re in the other. Our task then becomes to understand what triggers our fixed mindset. What are the events or situations that take us to a place where we feel our (or other people’s) abilities are fixed? What are the events or situations that take us to a place of judgment rather than to a place of development?Other concepts :Naming fixed persona mindset example create your own Maurice Easy to blame someone always? But it’s not good for a relationship to pin everything on your partner. When you fail at other tasks, it’s hard to keep blaming someone else. But when something goes wrong in a relationship, it’s easy to blame someone else. In fact, in the fixed mindset you have a limited set of choices. One is to blame your own permanent qualities. And one is to blame your partner’s. You can see how tempting it is to foist the blame onto the other guy.Create your own Maurice and blame him instead. Better yet, work toward curing yourself of the need to blame. Move beyond thinking about fault and blame all the time."

This rereading also confirmed that this is one of the books that will accompany my growth throughout different phases of my life. I believe it will accompany for the rest of my life, actually. It has pressed me to recognize the areas in which I had a fixed mindset and those in which I had a growth mindset and it has helped me change my view in the areas I had that fixed mindset.I was already able to see the difference in my behavior from the first reading to the second. In some instances (before that first reading) I reacted with a fixed mindset but now in my second reading I noted that in some of those instances I have already made some changes and I can manage to react with a growth mindset.

26,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3745545-roslyn,2,"1) The author begins by going on and on about how important she is and how important her ideas are. Which made her sound insecure, and let me know right off the bat that she does not trust me to read her ideas and determine for myself whether they are good ideas or not. 2) In the beginning she also announces her ideas as one more panacea. One thing that is the cause of all problems. This made it hard to take her book seriously at all.3) Her idea of fixed and growth ""mindsets"" is NOT a new psychology, it is the concept of self-esteem by a new name. Or rather one character trait of people with high self-esteem and low self-esteem. She wouldn't know this though, since her only knowledge of the self-esteem movement comes from pop culture dumb-downs and are inaccurate. She makes some statements about ""the self-esteem movement"" that she means as insults but for someone who has actually read quite a bit about it, just confirms that she has never actually read a single thing by Nathaniel Branden and has no idea what he meant by self-esteem. 4) Her idea of fixed and growth ""mindsets"" is also similar to the concept of securely attached and insecurely attached individuals. (I would say that attachment style is another aspect of self-esteem.) Again, since she is the classic psychologist that apparently does not read what her fellow psychologists are writing, she has no idea. She thinks she has discovered something new and different.5) That being said, thinking in terms of growth is great! And I think her book would be a help to many people.6) BUT keep in mind that this is a dumb-down. She doesn't really examine the issues at hand and develop a full theory, she just comes up with some fun words and takes an entire book to explain something she could have written a 1 page paper on.7) ""Growth mindsets"" are fascinating to me. Why some people feel ""right"" in life and others feel not-good-enough no matter what they do fascinates me. This issue is tied, not just to our psychology, but to the WAY we think, it's tied to how our brains form concepts and abstractions, it's tied to our repression of our own fear of death--our attempts to control life, it's tied to religion and our ideas of ""good"" and ""bad."" It's tied to our culture and the messages we get in school and in the media, regardless of how we were parented. It's tied to our ideas about ""the pursuit of happiness"" and altruism. It's possibly tied to IQ. It's definitely tied to drugs--everybody has something they use to repress their strong feelings. This is a subject I have read hundreds of books on and I have found no real answer but plenty of panaceas! I too have noted that some people seem to take life lightly and others carry the weight of the world on their shoulders. Many psychologists (I think) are the latter and spend their lives trying to figure out how to be more like the former. They write these books trying to understand the light people and come up with all kinds of theories. And they're all a little helpful or at the very least interesting. That's this book: a little helpful.If this is a subject that interests you, skip this book and read: Happiness, a history by McMahon or Jordan Peterson’s 12 Rules."

28,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1187470-mike,4,"Carol Dweck’s Mindset: The New Psychology of Success is based on a deceptively simple—yet powerful—premise. The central distinction she draws here is directly relevant to any of us interested in teaching leadership. According to Dr. Dweck (a Stanford psychology professor), each of us adopts one of two mindsets about life: the fixed or growth mindset. People with fixed mindsets tend to see human potential as static and finite; people with growth mindsets see human potential as more dynamic and elastic. Obviously, those who believe that leaders are “born, not made” subscribe to the fixed mindset. Those of us sharing the gcLi’s core philosophy—i.e. that leadership can be taught—fall into the growth mindset camp.	When Dr. Deak compares neurological pathways to rubber bands, she invokes the growth mindset. Similarly, when a leadership scholar like Professor Ron Heifetz of Harvard distinguishes adaptive from technical leadership, his distinction implicitly entails growth vs. fixed mindsets too. Over the long haul, the more successful athletes, teachers, spouses, coaches, professionals and entrepreneurs naturally tend to manifest beliefs and behaviors characteristic of the growth mindset. Few of us are bound to enjoying playing or working for coaches or bosses with fixed mindsets. Dweck’s book is full of cautionary examples of those sorts of leaders (from the likes of the Enron executives to coaches like the mercurial—perhaps infamous—Bobby Knight).	These memorable, illustrative anecdotes are one of the signal strengths of Mindset. Many readers of this sort of literature are already well familiar with the process-oriented, growth-minded approaches of perennial champions like Michael Jordan or long-tenured UCLA basketball coach John Wooden. Both these remarkable competitors managed to achieve outstanding success in the win-loss column over long careers. But both considered winning merely an inevitable byproduct of their zealous pursuit of athletic excellence and their willingness to outwork their opponents. Seeking constant growth and improvement in their own teams’ abilities were Wooden’s and Jordan’s primary focus. By manifesting their growth mindsets this way, they were also able to accomplish unparalleled productivity and victorious results—but almost as an afterthought or matter of course.	Dweck and other similarly minded leadership scholars believe that leaders emerge naturally in organizations that prize learning and manifest pervasive growth mindsets. Her dichotomy also recalls James MacGregor Burns’s seminal distinction between “transactional” and “transforming” leadership. Transactional leaders—according to Burns—simply “exchange valued things” with their followers. They have a sort of quid pro quo arrangement, in which everyone’s needs and wishes get served despite possibly finite resources. Operating out of a growth instead of fixed mindset, by contrast, transforming leaders seek to enlarge the size of the relevant pie. Burns’s transforming leaders use mutual engagement between them and and their followers to enhance their collective potential, thus raising the possibilities for all.	Dweck closes her analysis by pointing out that we each can choose which mindset we embody from moment to moment. Her final chapter, for instance, offers a sort of self-guided workshop or tutorial one might follow to work on changing one’s primary (default) mindset. By showing how many contexts in which mindsets profoundly affect one’s experiences, prospects for success, satisfaction in life, or the quality of one’s relationships, Dr. Dweck offers her readers a simple, broadly significant insight."

Characteristics such as intelligence, personality, and creativity are fixed traits, rather than something that can be developed. 2nd group has a growth mindset coming from a belief that our basic qualities are things we can cultivate through effort. Group 2 understands that people differ greatly – in aptitude, talents, interests, temperaments etc... but everyone can change and grow through application and experience. The book also goes deep into implications of each belief and points out some basic mistakes that teachers, managers and parents make in their every day life which forces those they influence into a fixed mindset. I love reading about success and this book instantly turned into one of my favorites on the topic, the mindset concept is absolutely critical to understand and I would highly recommend you to read this book!"

It was slightly repetitive but it was just really zoning in on the points.This is definitely a re-read so that I can take notes and study it more.Just off the top of my head here are some of my take aways:- Be growth-minded not fixed-minded. Fixed minded is when you believe people were born with innate talents and skills and they can't develop/learn/grow. While the growth mind set is about becoming anything or anyone you want and learning and growing into the person you want to be.- Every human is born into a set of genetic code from their parents and has experiences which can or need not define them. You can change how you act and the decisions you make if you want to, it will just take some effort and work- Lots of great information on how to raise your children in this book. How certain praises actuakly do harm instead of your intended good praise. Like saying ""Oh wow Billy you got 100% on your test? That means you made no mistakes that's great! You're so smart."" This instill fear into Billy's mind that he should try his best not to make mistakes in the future or else he will not be ""smart."" And children feed off of the praise their parents give them so this is so crucial. It's better to talk about their effort instead of judging them. Instead say "" Oh wow Billy you got 100% on your test? You must have worked really hard and studied, I'm so proud of your efforts.""- Shyness was also an interesting aspect of this book because if you are a shy person that basically means that you are more so fixed-minded because you find judgement of other people important to you. If you were growth minded then you would focus n working on your shyness and uncomfortableness to improve yourself instead of just defining yourself as shy and that's the end of it.- When you are raised by judgemental family it can influence you to become fixed-minded.Carol S. Dweck is a smart cookie, I look forward to her future publications ;)""the courage to be open—to welcome change and new ideas regardless of their source. Real self-confidence is not reflected in a title, an expensive suit, a fancy car, or a series of acquisitions. It is reflected in your mindset: your readiness to grow."""""

Due to its repetitiveness, which sets in very early in the book, I originally planned to give it only three stars. But the message is an extremely important one, and the illustrative anecdotes are interesting and worth reading, thus the fourth star. "
37,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10400867,2,"The idea of having a growth mindset isn’t revolutionary, however, just like any good self-help book, it focuses on a specific trait, repositions its importance, and expands its application.The idea of “growth mindset” is insightful and impactful. Once integrated within the mindset of an individual, relationship or organization, the applications become limitless. The main idea of the book:""Every one of us should believe that our basic qualities are things we can cultivate through effort. Yes, people differ greatly but everyone can change and grow through application and experience""As a result, we should change the way we look at any past set back, current challenge, or future perceived distasteful experience. We should think about and approach them as learning opportunities. Thinking of them in such away: a) increases our willingness to be exposed to challenging situations, and b) increases the learning, and thus, our development as individuals. All this will result, in continuous incremental learnings as time passes by.The idea isn’t just about changing the way you think, but it’s about making this way of thinking a habit. This habit, will “convert” any belief about oneself limits to a narrative about “learning opportunities”The author then spends a good 70% of the book showing how this is applied in different situations (teachers, spouses, workplace, and sports).The verdict:•	The book delivers a short, simple, self-evident yet important truth that can be delivered in an article or 4 pages max. The additional 270 pages was pure waste. Too repetitive. •	The author is ‘too’ in love with her theory, she tries to attribute all human achievements to it. She oversells it in my opinion.•	The examples she gives are too polarized, too ideal. She portrays people with fixed mindset in a stereotypical shallow way showing them as morons.

It made sense right away and was easy to get into. Your mindset (either a growth mindset or a fixed mindset) determines how you relate to your abilities and experiences in school, business, relationships, and sports (those are the areas she covers). I could see myself in both of the mindsets she described, and I think they're a useful tool for making sense of places where I struggle. They offer a way to organize a response. I have a sense of the freedom in the growth mindset: nothing sticks to you because you don't identify with the results; you're here to learn and grow, so fear and anger and results don't have such a grip on you. I picture someone loose in a stream of events, like a slippery fish. But it's a learning stream. It's funny, though. I feel like I need a break from these kinds of books: idea books to help you make something work, to get better at something. Maybe the Joker's monologues in The Dark Knight had an effect on me. (I saw it by myself late at night, which is the best time to come out of a movie.) I kind of liked them. I thought they were the best of their kind. Something like, ""They're all schemers . . ."" and he wants to disrupt it, subvert it, hold it up for its ridiculousness. This isn't exactly a schemer book, but it's definitely an aiming at success book (""success"" is in the sub-title). Ways to succeed rely on a simplification of what's going on. It's the only way to create a model to use to work with life, but I get tired of it eventually. I've read a lot of good ones this summer, though. I guess I'm ready to put my new tools to use. I don't need anymore new tools right now, thank you. I feel like I'm ready for Handke again. And maybe Philip Dick. I want to read Ubik. "
45,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13852634-alan-bevan,2,"I struggled to rate this book. It offers a single gem of a concept - perhaps not particularly original but nevertheless really important. And that gem is that how we think about ourselves can make all the difference. Do we see ourselves to have a fixed capacity or do we have a growth mindset? It reminded me of my Dad who consistently frustrated me by never trying anything new on the grounds that he was not the sort of person who did X. He genuinely seemed to believe he was not free to choose. He didn't see life as an opportunity to learn. This book offers a language to describe the alternative that he never saw, the 'growth mindset'.But that was it really for the book. That single concept is padded with countless (and to me tedious) anecdotes but it offered nothing more other than superficially considering the role of parents and teachers in relation to the development of mindsets.So yes, it contains a really important concept and I would have liked my father to read it but I reckon it would have more impact if condensed to a pithy 1000 word essay. But then there wouldn't be book to sell which would obviously be contrary to Dweck's mindset.And lastly, I am stunned that the publishers can get away with the sub heading, 'The new Psychology of Success'. New? Really?"
46,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5977628-kat,2,"I found this book a little frustrating. It's overall message is good, it explores the differences between having a fixed and growth mindset. A fixed mindset believes your intelligence, skills, talent, and life are all basically set in stone and can't be improved. A growth mindset believes that you can always become smarter or more skilled with effort, and views criticism as motivation to improve instead of a crushing blow. It's definitely an important lesson that everyone should learn. My frustration is mostly in how the lesson is delivered, and that is mostly though stories about grade school student, athletes, and CEOs. There is a lot of hand wringing about the folly of complementing your kids. The author tells a story of how she accidentally told her husband he was brilliant and gasped in horror at her mistake. There is praise of sleazy CEOs who've ""made it"" (while screwing their employees and the environment) and Harvey Weinstein of all people (though this was published in 2009). It just feels a little silly and like every other self help book that leans on stories about football players and men who realized their business might do better if their weren't such giant a**holes. There are better self improvement books out there."
47,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14858185-steven,2,"Disappointing and repetitive pop-psychology book based on 1 idea that seems dubious from anecdotal experience. The author talks about the ""fixed mindset"" those who believe that traits like intelligence, personality, sports ability etc. are largely determined genetically and those who believe in the ""growth mindset"" that all traits can be fundamentally changed with enough effort, with the growth mindset being the path to success.This is a false dichotomy. It's not an either/or (growth vs fixed mindset) but a continuum. We are part genetically determined, part environmentally determined. The assertion that only those with the growth mindset achieve their potential seems false and I'd like to see Dweck's data. Those who believe they're innately gifted in a specific trait, usually work and practice long and hard to perfect their skills in their particular talents, while ignoring the areas they are weak in. Dweck's handful of examples of people succeeding in an area they were initially believed to have little talent in hardly proves her thesis that one can do anything if one has the right mindset. "
48,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16612969-andrea,5,"In the book Mindset, by Carol Dweck, the author explains the fixed mindset and offers tips to help you move toward a more growth oriented mindset. A person with a fixed mindset believes that their intelligence, skills, and abilities are static and there is nothing they can do change that. Someone with a growth mindset believes that learning is a lifelong process. In the book, Dr Dweck used athlete John McEnroe as an example of someone with a fixed mindset. McEnroe believed that he was the best tennis player and if he lost a match, it was always due to some outside force that was beyond his control. He even rooted for his friends and family to lose their matches, so he could be the best in his circle. He never practiced, because he believed that someone with natural talent shouldn't require practice. On the opposite side of the spectrum, you have Michael Jordan. He was arguably one the greatest basketball players of all time, but he was cut from his high school team. With a lot of effort, time, and practice, he went on to the NBA. If you embrace a growth mindset, skills can be developed over time."

Fixed mindset people avoid challenges, give-up when they encounters obstacles, they won’t take effort to make things better, they will avoid useful negative feedback from others and they won’t learn from their mistakes.Growth mindset people will be having desire to learn, never avoid challenges, learn from mistakes, they will take every effort to make things better, they will take valuable information from criticism and negative feedback.We have to learn from our mistakes and change ourself to improving our Intelligent and potential.

53,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1586355-chad-warner,4,"This book changed my perspective on abilities and potential. Dweck shows how to move from the fixed mindset (the belief that human qualities and abilities are set and essentially unalterable) to the growth mindset (the belief that those qualities and abilities can be cultivated through effort). Dweck, a psychologist, based the book on solid scientific research, not the pseudoscientific mystical nonsense often found in ""success psychology"" books. Dweck applies the mindsets to sports, business leadership, relationships, parenting, and teaching. The book has far too many anecdotes for my taste; it’s full of specific examples of famous CEOs and athletes, as well as ordinary people.My favorite parts were those that advised how to talk to children about their successes and failures. Intellectually, I agree with Dweck’s advice that you should praise effort, not ability, and that when a child does something quickly, you should challenge rather than praise them, but that can be emotionally difficult for a parent to do. I also found the section on bullying interesting, because I was bullied for most of my school years. I skimmed the many examples from sports, because I’m generally disinterested in sports.I read this because it was referred to in several books, articles, and podcasts about business and/or web design.The MindsetsFixed Mindset• Your qualities and intelligence are very basic to you and can’t change very much. If you have the ability, you’ll do well. If you don’t, you won’t.• Characteristics: passing up chances to learn, feeling labeled by a failure, getting discouraged when something requires effort.• Framework: judge and be judged; ""You have permanent traits and I'm judging them.""Growth Mindset• No matter your qualities and intelligence, you can always change substantially. Abilities can be cultivated and improved.• Characteristics: taking challenges, learning from failure, continuing effort.• Framework: learn and help learn; ""You are a developing person and I am interested in your development.""The Truth About Ability and Accomplishment• In the growth mindset, abilities can be cultivated, but that doesn’t mean that everything can or should be changed.• Benjamin Bloom, after 40 years of research on school learning, said, “What any person in the world can learn, almost all persons can learn, if provided with the appropriate prior and current conditions of learning.”• “Just because some people can do something with little or no training, it doesn’t mean that others can’t do it (and sometimes do it even better) with training.”• People (especially children) do better when praised for effort than ability.Relationships: Mindsets in Love (Or Not)• The fixed mindset believes that successful relationships don’t require effort. The growth mindset believes that they do.Bullying• To reduce bullying, change the school mindset.• Fight the atmosphere of judgement and create one of collaboration and self-improvement.• Empower bystanders to help victims.• Enforce discipline, but don’t judge the bully as a person. Make them feel liked and welcomed at school.• Praise the bully’s steps in the right direction (staying out of fighting, getting along with others). Praise efforts, not the person.• Teachers can point a bully away from judgment and towards compassion by not implying they’re a bad person, showing respect, and asking for the bully’s advice for helping bullied students.Parents, Teachers, and Coaches: Where Do Mindsets Come From?• Give children the growth-mindset message, “You are a developing person and I am interested in your development,” not the fixed-mindset message, “You have permanent traits and I’m judging them.”• Praising children’s intelligence harms motivation and performance. It gives a temporary boost, but if they run into difficulty, they’ll think failure means they’re dumb. Instead, praise for the growth-oriented process: what they accomplish through practice, study, persistence, strategy.• Don’t talk about others in terms of fixed judgments in front of children, or they’ll think you use the same fixed judgments on them.• When children do something quickly and perfectly, don’t praise their speed and perfection. Instead, say it was too easy and give them a challenge.• When a child fails, tell them you understand their disappointment, but they’ll need to work harder.• Use misbehavior as an occasion for teaching, not judgment.• When teachers judge, students will sabotage the teacher by not trying. When teachers care for students and show them school is a way to grow their minds, they try.Changing Mindsets: A WorkshopAs a family, talk about your efforts, strategies, setbacks, and learning every day."

55,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4177031-troy-blackford,4,"Original '3-star' Review (3/11/14) [see update below]:This was a book of good ideas that felt rather stretched out. This is probably because it is based on the author's original newspaper article, which became unexpectedly successful. There is a definite vibe of 'let's cash in on this article's success by stretching it out into a book-length work' that plagues the first third of Mindset. But, if you can stick out the abysmal first part, which seeks to assure readers the ideas contained in the book are helpful with a brutal series of 'A woman in Topeka e-mailed me that she tried the ideas in this book, and SHE LOVED IT!' type statements (along with the inverse: 'A man in Fort Wayne failed to use these ideas, and HE'S MISERABLE!'), the book which follows does indeed have some great points. This is well worth thinking about.I chalk it up to the state of the modern publishing industry that Carol Dweck was unable to print a book a third or maybe half the length of this, as 'that's not what customers want to buy,' because I'm sure I would have preferred a leaner, meaner, more toned version of this book. But if you can sit out the filler, this book is full of great points that employees/employers, teachers, parents, and people learning any skill will do well to ponder.UPDATE (10/5/15): This is over a year after I've read this book, and I've seen Dr. Dweck's research mentioned countless times since. I didn't greatly appreciate, at the time of my prior review, that Dr. Dweck is a researcher, and wrote this book sharing her findings for popular consumption. I can certainly see how pressure to stretch her findings into a book-length work led to the deficiencies I noted earlier, but I very much appreciate the value of the work she did and feel my earlier rating of 'three stars' is simply not fair. Now that I have a better understanding of what this work is meant to be and who Dr. Carol Dweck is, I am adding a star."

I ran across its title in several different contexts before I decided that if such dissimilar people swear by it, it can't be as obvious as it sounds. And its implications are wide-ranging and interesting. It made me see the world in a new way. It's entertaining and an easy read, and would be especially valuable to teachers, parents, and coaches, but really applies to pretty much everybody. Instead of subtitling it ""The New Psychology of Success"" (eyeroll, please) it could have been called ""What Great Teachers Know."" I didn't read quite all the way to the end, but something I felt was missing from this book is that few people have an overall ""fixed mindset"" or an overall ""growth mindset."" As I think about people I know, most have different mindsets for each realm of their life. Some people have an academic or career growth mindset but a fixed relationship or athletics mindset, for example. Since most people have a growth mindset in at least one area, learning to expand those attitudes into other areas seems like a useful path toward developing an advantageous mindset where it's lacking. And in fact, I think that's often what happens. A kid does badly in school and his parents put him in martial arts classes; not only does he love it, but he starts getting better grades and getting along with his friends better too. As he learns how to achieve in one area of his life, he begins to apply those same achievement skills to other areas as well. Like any other summary of this book, this sounds tediously obvious, but the implications are deeper than a summary can convey. "
57,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6317928-asra-syed,3,"I do agree with Carol Dweck's idea of mindsets as fixed or growth and how these mindsets can be limiting or beneficial. I've struggled with explaining to students how ""smart"" isn't something you are, and that instead you can work toward getting smarter and more capable, so Dweck's concepts will help with that. But I probably could have read an article about this or watched a video instead of reading this entire book. It gets incredibly redundant and she seems to take the ideas a little too far, attributing the mindsets to all sorts of famous accomplished people, which gets to be a stretch. Plus, she really seems to oversimplify or misunderstand the concept of depression (not that I can claim to really understand the mental illness myself, but I do know that it's a medical/chemical/emotional condition that can't just be fixed by changing one's mindset). I kept reading hoping that the book would provide concrete ways to work on changing mindsets instead of just redundancy proving that her ideas of these two mindsets it correct, but I guess you have to go pay for her Brainology material for that. Of course you do. "

Looking back, she should be embarrassed about claiming Roger Clemens' mindset was what it took for him to succeed. At least she didn't include Lance Armstrong. And her take on the corporate world is strange. The way CEOs were rewarded during the time period she writes about had to do with increasing share holder value immediately. Mindset has nothing to do with it. In hindsight, her praise of Circuit City and GE's Jack Welch doesn't look so good today.

61,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15896137-olivia,2,"The main idea of this book is one I think is incredibly powerful and impactful in people's lives. Before picking this up I was very familiar with the subject. This idea of having a growth vs fixed mindset is BIG in education and child development in the US. And I think for good reason, which is what made me excited to see this main work by the person who termed those ideas and leads the research in the area.I found myself disappointed because the power and understanding of it starts to get watered down by an excessive amount of storytelling and a very repetitive nature. Countless stories of how x person was the way they were because they had a growth/fixed mindset. And she would assume the mindset of so many different people as if she had asked them directly what their mindset was, and used it to explain her points, which made me weary. I think the concept is great, but the execution not so much.I appreciated her showing the way mindsets can influence so many aspects of our lives, and I particularly liked discussions of mindsets between teachers and students.But, again, this book feels repetitive and could have been shorter, and I think I also would have preferred reading the update version (didn't realize there was one until finishing this one lol) because I imagine it would include more update/recent research which would give more substance to the book than just the storytelling. A topic in growth mindset that I love is the power of the word 'yet' [aka, I can't do art.... yet.] But I guess that is post-this book's publication because it wasn't mentioned. "
62,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9862564-erika-rs,3,"Mindset lays out a idea that has the potential to improve our lives: whether or not we improve and grow is determined, to a large degree, by whether or not we believe we can improve and grow. While each person has a range of possible aptitude in any given subject, that range is generally much larger than assumed and early performance in the given area is almost never a good predictor of overall potential. Just knowing that you can grow can lead to huge improvements in performance. These improvements aren't magical. They have to do with how people approach problems. Individuals with the ""fixed mindset"" see early performance as indicative of potential aptitude and see failures as reasons to give up. Individuals with the ""growth mindset"" see early performance as the beginning of a journey and failures as an opportunity to learn and improve. With the fixed mindset, practice is seen as unnecessary and critique as negative -- if you're naturally good you should always be able to perform well. With the growth mindset, practice and critique are seen as a necessary part of growth. That doesn't mean they are always enjoyed, but they are understood in context of growth. A positive attitude towards practice and critique leads to more practice and tuning which, in turn, eventually leads to much better performance by growth mindset individuals.The above presents these two mindsets as if they were personality traits, but that is a simplification for discussion. While individuals tend to use one of the mindsets more than the other, the mindsets are really applied on a topic-by-topic basis. Someone might have a growth mindset with regard to some technical skill and a fixed mindset when it comes to people skills. The mindset with which we approach a particular aptitude is often influenced by our attitude toward it, and the way we were treated when we first practiced it.That second influence -- how we were treated -- is one of my key takeaways of this book. Since mindset is learned, how people (especially children) are praised can influence their future attitude toward whatever they are doing. People who are praised from a fixed perspective are more likely to take on a fixed mindset: ""You're so smart! You should be a scientist."" ""You know, not everyone is good at art. It's okay."" People who are praised from a growth perspective are more likely to take on a growth mindset: ""You worked really hard on that, and it looks like the hard work paid off."" ""You didn't get do well on the exam, but you still learned a lot. Let's brainstorm some ideas for how you can study better next time."" The popular wisdom that children should be praised for their effort, not their attributes comes out of the mindset research, and now it's clear why the type of praise matters. Praising effort encourages a growth mindset. Praising attributes encourages a fixed mindset.My other key takeaway is that mindsets are not fixed. You can have a growth mindset toward your mindset. The process can be painful, especially in areas where you are leveling out on skills you see as fixed which have brought you far, but new mindsets can be learned.All that said, why am I giving this book a 3? The beginning and end of the book are excellent. However, the middle of the book is formulaic. Each chapter has the form: Define an area of interest and talk about a number of aspects of it. For each aspect, show by discussion and example how a growth mindset feeds success and a fixed mindset feeds failure. These chapters are hit or miss depending on your interest in the current topic. Overall, while the book may or may not be worth you time, the ideas are well worth a look."

As I read this book, I thought about how I respond to my own setbacks and found myself relating to the fixed mindset in many areas of my life. Since reading it, it has tremendously helped me refrain from reacting with a fixed mindset, and instead trying to apply the growth mindset whenever I can. The reason being, a growth mindset helps me respond to life challenges in a healthier and more positive way. The concept itself may appear to be simple: People have fixed mindsets or growth mindsets. The former is a deterrent as it suggests that our basic abilities, talents, traits, etc. are fixed and are just a part of who we are. On the other hand, a growth mindset allows us to understand that there is always room for self-improvement and it encourages a learning attitude. One of my favourite quotes is: ""Becoming is better than being."" I find this simple and short phrase to be inspiring and motivating. The idea that we are not forced to be who we are at the moment, the idea that we can always keep learning and improving, the idea that throughout our entire lives we will go through many defining changes, makes me feel more optimistic about the future and life itself. We are not stuck in our life, we are simply stuck in our way of thinking. Of course, changing mindsets is not as easy as deciding to do so. It takes a lot effort and self-awareness. This is a book that I will be revisiting throughout my life as I inevitably encounter challenges in school, my career, my relationships, etc. to remind myself to maintain a growth mindset so that I can tackle each obstacle with the mindset that there is always room for positive change and growth. I recommend this book to everyone because even if you already understand and know about fixed and growth mindsets, a reminder of the differences these mindsets can have on your life is well worth reading."
64,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21679620-tuan-anh-le,4,"Summary: There are two types of mindsets: fixed and growth. In a fixed mindset, we assume our qualities are fixed. This can have bad consequences. For example, we are afraid to try new things because failing would mean that we are unchangeably bad. If we are good at something, we constantly want to prove that that is the case. In a growth mindset, we assume our qualities can be changed. This shift in focus allows us to worry less and enjoy life more. Regardless of whether we are good or bad at something, the growth mindset gives a clear course of action: try to improve a bit. The contrast between the two mindsets is explored in different settings like management, sports, coaching, parenting and relationships.This book puts a concrete label on a large set of ideas. This can be both good and bad. Good as it allows us to transfer insights between different domains (management to sports to coaching). Bad because every domain can have different peculiarities that must be dealt with on a case-by-case basis and putting a general label might be counter-productive. For example, having a ""growth mindset"" in management can require an entirely different set of behaviours than in sports. As such, it is difficult to tease out concrete and widely-applicable (across domains) lessons apart from ""always try to improve a bit""."

The title was repellant but glowing references from other books and positive reviews from seemingly smart.. oops... seemingly hard working people induced me to bite. Dweck's theory seems plausible but this book does a lousy job presenting and defending her big idea. If after seven experiments involving hundreds of children you have the clearest findings you've ever seen there is likely a problem with your methodology. Have the findings been replicated? By someone not wedded to the theory? I started this book with an unusually high degree of credulity but Dweck managed to sap it with anecdotes and oversimplification. In trying to maximize its potential audience the book comes across like a dare to be great course on buying property with no money down. People I respect take this book and author seriously but there was so little substance that I leave to go troll Google Scholar guarded and angry at Dweck for not earning $8.99. (I ultimately signed my daughter up at brainology.us which attempts to help children internalize Dweck's growth-centered strategies. So far, she thinks the course is interesting but puerile. Hmmmm.)"

There are people out there who look at failure as an indication that they need to do better, and people who look at failure as evidence that they shouldn't even bother with that sort of thing because they're obviously not good at it. I'm one of the latter sort, and in reading this book I looked back over a life of things I gave up on as soon as they got really difficult, things I lost interest in when it looked like I wasn't going to be good at them right away, and things I never tried. ""You can change!"" Dr Dweck says, but she doesn't really give you any notions of HOW. She talks about classes that have four year olds debating Shakespeare and says that you can't just throw Shakespeare at your toddler, you have to give them the tools they need, but she doesn't really say what those tools are. She does say that just knowing there's a difference, knowing you can change, will help, but I wish she gave more concrete advice.That said, yesterday I started playing Bioshock 2, even though I've long established that I'm not good at first person shooters and, thus, shouldn't even bother, so maybe that's something."
67,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2812589-eny-rebel,3,"The book illustrates how the world can be divided into two groups of people; those with a fixed mindset, and those with a growth mindset.People with a fixed mindset think intelligence is static. You’re smart or you aren’t, they think they just born this way. Therefore, if you succeed, you’re a smart person. Therefore, pick the easier problem so success is more likely, and you validate your smartness. Pick a hard problem and you may fail, revealing your stupidity.People with a growth mindset believe intelligence can be developed. They have a desire to learn so they embrace challenges, keep on going when they experience setbacks, and are not afraid to work hard because they see it as the path to achievement. Generally, growth mindset people says people can get smarter. They are more likely to take challenges. Therefore, pick the hard problem who cares if you fail. Mindset develops when we were child and the parents are very influential for the development of the mindset of their children. This book helps you understand the two mindsets, why you want to have a growth mindset, and gives you tools to avoid the fixed mindset and develop the growth mindset."

What I liked about it: The idea. The explanation of fear of failure in terms of fixed mindset. If you believe your traits are fixed then every success makes you a „quality human being“ and every failure takes that away. So you get tense and anxious to avoid failures at all cost. Usually at the cost of trying new things and facing challenges. It resonated with me greatly and explained a lot of patterns I kept catching myself in. For example how I used to memorize all the things at the university. I used to feel that this is most likely not the best way to go about learning, but was so so afraid that if I’ll try something new, I might not get the straight A’s. This was an example of a fixed mindset through the book. I really hope reading this book will help to set myself on a better path. I think it has a lot of potential for learning to love new challenges as well as for better communication with me peers. Cos seeing other people failures as learning opportunities and not manifestations of their actual skills and value could help to create a more compassionate relationships. What I disliked: I think it is the same thing most people complain about in the reviews. There are a lot of examples from sports, businesses etc. Dumbed down to the question of “did they have a fixed mindset or a growth mindset”. When usually things are not so simple. The best anecdote to illustrate this is the fact that before reading this book, I’ve read “Quiet: the power of introverts in a world that can’t stop talking”. And that book explained the collapse of Enron in terms of their leaders not listening to the introverts. While this one said it happened cos the leaders had a fixed mindset.Ideas/ Quotes:“The fixed mindset makes you concerned with how you’ll be judged; the growth mindset makes you concerned with improving.”“So in the fixed mindset, both positive and negative labels can mess with your mind. When you’re given a positive label, you’re afraid of losing it, and when you’re hit with a negative label, you’re afraid of deserving it.”“Failure has been transformed from an action (I failed) to an identity (I am a failure). This is especially true in the fixed mindset. If failure means you lack competence or potential—that you are a failure—where do you go from there?”“People who believe in fixed traits feel an urgency to succeed, and when they do, they may feel more than pride. They may feel a sense of superiority, since success means that their fixed traits are better than other people’s.”“Just by knowing about the two mindsets, you can start thinking and reacting in new ways. People tell me they start to catch themselves when they are in the throes of the fixed mindset—passing up a chance for learning, feeling labeled by a failure, or getting discouraged when something requires a lot of effort.”“Don’t judge. Teach. It’s a learning process.”"
74,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3472382-ulzii,5,"There were a few books that really changed my life. The first one was a Dori Ider Duudee where I knew that there is much to learn ahead of me. There were 7 Habits of Highly Effective People. There was an Alchemist. There was How to Win Friends and Influence People, Great Expectation, A Song of Fire and Ice which I'm still reading, and more. I would totally title Mindset as one of my favorite and life-changing books.This book is about how people's mindset determines its destiny. She claims there are two types of mindsets. One kind of mindset is called fixed. A fixed mindset believes that they are born with talent and intelligence. Thus, they don't have to try hard to learn something. In the fixed mindset mind, there are either losers or winners, no neutral ground. If you have a fixed mindset, you wouldn't be happy about other people's happiness. They believe that someone has to be sad in order for them to be happy. In contrast, the other mindset is called a growth mindset. People with this mindset focus on the effort, hard work instead of the end result. Everyone has unknown potential. Teachers, parents, and leaders' responsibility is to aid children, students, and employees to achieve their highest potential by encouraging their effort. I want to give an example of two types of parenting mindset. A fixed mindset parent would say to their kids, ""son, you are so talented,"" ""daughter, you are very smart."" The child would think his talent or smartness lead to his achievement, not because of his amount of effort. At this moment, a fixed mind kid would stop working hard.Meanwhile, a growth mindset parent would praise their kids differently. They would give a compliment on their effort. They would say, ""kid, you got an A, so you must have worked hard."" Next time, that kid would work harder because he/she knows hard work leads to achievement. I also reflected on myself about this mindset idea. When I was a small child, my dad used to tell me that I was very smart, bright like Mendeleev, who formulated the chemical periodic table. Now it makes sense to me why I always tried to be the smartest kid in the class in high school. I always felt like a loser whenever there is a better student in my class or school. And when I didn't understand, I felt stupid and stopped learning. I would say I am smart; why don't I understand it!. Also, I wouldn't ask for help from other students because I didn't want them to know that I was not smart. If there was something I didn't understand, I would just hide it. So no one knew I was not smart. It feels like I missed out on a lot of stuff that I would have learned. After I finished the book, I made some changes in my process of thinking. Mostly the book helped me to see myself and change my mindset. Even though I haven't compared myself with others much, now I wouldn't compare myself with others at all. There are no winners or losers, but people who are trying to be their best. I can only compare myself to myself. It seems like everything is possible with the right mindset. However, even when things go wrong, I won't blame or hate myself because I tried my best, and that's all that matters. I hope you read or listen to this book if you haven't. It will help you to change your mindset for your life. I'm pretty sure that I missed a lot of good points in the book, but how complimenting affects kids touched me the most. "

The correct question is: Did I make my best effort?” If so, he says, “You may be outscored but you will never lose.” “We like to think of our champions and idols as superheroes who were born different from us. We don’t like to think of them as relatively ordinary people who made themselves extraordinary.”“So what should we say when children complete a task—say, math problems—quickly and perfectly? Should we deny them the praise they have earned? Yes. When this happens, I say, “Whoops. I guess that was too easy. I apologize for wasting your time.

How can that be? Don’t children love to be praised? Yes, children love praise. And they especially love to be praised for their intelligence and talent. It really does give them a boost, a special glow—but only for the moment. The minute they hit a snag, their confidence goes out the window and their motivation hits rock bottom. If success means they’re smart, then failure means they’re dumb. That’s the fixed mindset.” “it’s not always the people who start out the smartest who end up the smartest.”“Genius is not enough; we need to get the job done.”“What on earth would make someone a nonlearner? Everyone is born with an intense drive to learn. Infants stretch their skills daily. Not just ordinary skills, but the most difficult tasks of a lifetime, like learning to walk and talk. They never decide it’s too hard or not worth the effort. Babies don’t worry about making mistakes or humiliating themselves. They walk, they fall, they get up. They just barge forward. What could put an end to this exuberant learning? The fixed mindset. As soon as children become able to evaluate themselves, some of them become afraid of challenges. They become afraid of not being smart. I have studied thousands of people from preschoolers on, and it’s breathtaking how many reject an opportunity to learn.” "

This feels a like a research paper that was optioned as a book, and she padded it out.However, if you have a fixed mindset, you will allow your internal limiting beliefs to hold you back or derail you. If you have a growth mindset, you don't allow failure to stop you from achieving your goals. Do I believe people can do anything they set their minds to? No, and maybe that shows I have a fixed mindset, but it's true. I will never run a 5 minute mile, no matter how hard I train. Absolutely never. I will never bench press 400 pounds. I will never be an astronaut. I'm realistic in the limitations of life, and if Carol Dweck really believes she could do anything, she either has very low goals or is living a life full of disappointment. I believe her overall message is to not let your attitude get in your way, work hard, and do better. Now you don't have to spend the money for this book. You're welcome.

When you work with students who are having a struggle with an aspect of school (especially with math) the #1 type of comment you hear is ""I just can't do _____."" Every chance I get I try and transmit the principles of this book to the students I work with. This book has taught me to always keep a mindset stories in my back pocket. The type of stories that start with ""this person was terrible at this thing at first"" and end with ""they are famous for that thing now."" Or that starts with ""remember how tough this thing was when you first started learning it?"" and ends with ""now you do it without having to even think about it.""Great book full of great concepts!

However, the book becomes a little tedious and repetitive (mainly due to the fact that it's a 300 page book simply on applications of the growth and fixed mindset types). A lot of the book is based on anecdotal evidence, which seems interesting at first but later feels very manipulated from the truth to fit the point that the author is trying to make. I'm also not sure I agree with the author on her consistent idea that anytime someone is successful or does something well that it is entirely due to them having a growth mindset, and anyone who suffers largely or does something bad definitely has a fixed mindset. Generally though, this book is a good read if wanting to understand the types of mindset more in applied contexts."

I liked how the content does fall under that category but without being too obvious about it. She talks about her research and her observations in detail, with real-life examples, which makes it much more believable and better than any of the other self-help books I have ever read (admittedly, not many - the few I did read put me off the genre). Through the middle of the book I was convinced by her theory and could relate to a couple of her mindset examples, and found that like most people, I have also been a sometimes unhealthy mixture of the two. It took me a while to finish the book; I took my time taking in the different aspects of the mindsets she was writing about, self-analyzing and getting back to it only when I felt like I had done justice to the previous part and/or needed motivation.

At the event, the principal spoke to the kinder parents and told us of a book study the teachers at the school had participated in this school year. She (the principal) had been so impressed with the book that she gifted the book to her own (grown) children and acquired copies for the parents of the school to check out. That was this book.Upon returning to my own school later that morning, I asked my own principal if she was familiar with the book. Not surprisingly, she had read it and also highly recommended it. What was surprising was that my principal informed me that Carol S. Dweck would be speaking in a free event here in town in one week's time. I immediately looked into it and, of course, the event was sold out. Minutes later, I discovered that a co-worker had a extra ticket and she brought it to me! When events unfold like that, I feel that it is fortuitous that I read the book. And, as it turned out, it was an important one for me to read right now.Dweck's premise is that people have one of two mindsets- a fixed mindset or a growth mindset. People with a fixed mindset believe that traits are fixed- intelligence, kindness, creativity- you either have it or you don't and the degree to which you are creative or intelligent cannot be changed. People with a growth mindset believe that you can acquire a higher level of intelligence or stronger creativity if you put in the hard work and see challenges or setbacks as opportunities to grow and learn.My son is smart, and he has been told he is smart his whole life. I am definitely guilty of praising his intelligence, but he also hears it from a lot of other people, and quite often. He does not get praised for his hard work or his diligent effort, or his perseverance, and that is likely because (at this point) he doesn't put forth much effort or have much perseverance. When things are hard, he is likely to get frustrated and quit. But things aren't hard for him very often. For now.I read this book with a sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach. I can see the fixed mindset establishing itself in my son quite comfortably and I need to do something about it. Luckily, this book also gives a lot of practical advice on changing your mindset and working with children to establish their mindsets. This is not a book about teaching or about parenting, although there are a lot of tips for both. There are chapters on mindsets in business and sports and even relationships. This book is a quick and easy read. I finished it in less than a week. I am excited to hear more from the author tomorrow night, and I definitely think the ideas in this book will have a lot of practical application in my life and the lives of my children and students.

Some people have a ""growth"" mindset stemming from a belief that one's abilities can change, which makes them value learning and effort, seek out new situations, and want to be with people who challenge them. Others have a ""fixed"" mindset stemming from a belief that one's intelligence and abilities are fixed, which makes them avoid activities that would imperil their self-image or reputation, avoid risks, seek out people who validate them, and get angry or defensive when presented with a challenge. The mindsets do not gel together in relationships and people with fixed mindsets often hit walls in their lives due to their habit of avoidance. (I've encountered descriptions of organizations (rather than individuals) that puts this in terms of a ""growth"" or a ""performance"" mindset, where the performance-oriented organization tries to, say, deliver impeccable and reliable customer service, rather than creating innovative products. In this context, I think the non-growth mindset can be positive, or it would even be ideal to have a mix of the two. But Dweck can't find anything positive to say about the fixed mindset in her telling.)This work has a really bad case of ""magazine-article-as-book"" but I still found it slightly worthwhile to read because of the idea that you could have one mindset for most parts of your life but adopt the other one in certain areas. This intrigued me because I definitely had a fixed mindset regarding my math ability through all of school (I let myself off the hook for being ""bad at math"" because I was good at other things and my teachers seemed to believe ability was fixed) and then, having gotten my mindset about math aligned better with my overall attitude, stubborned my way through a graduate program in computer science. This book gives a good account of precisely what changed in my attitude on that point, and it also makes a passionate argument that you can change your mindset.Still, people who would find this book useful probably won't read it by definition, it's written in a way that would just get their backs up, and I just gave you the whole gist in a few hundred words, so I wouldn't particularly recommend it."
87,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48164585-b-i-h,4,"In this book, Dweck argues that people could be categorized into 2 groups: fixed-mindset people and growth-mindset people. Fixed mindset people tend not to take too much risk because they believe in their fixed qualities. They are apt to prove themselves but their superiority and their talents. If life happens against them, they would be easily disappointed and depressed. Due to this quality, they try to avoid difficult tasks because those tasks would prove their competence. Conversely, Growth mindset people believe in progress and their capacities to grow. They don't start with a fixed quality and blindly fall into beliefs that their qualities are themselves. They accept their incompetence but make attempts to improve. In their mind, nothing is fixed and everything could grow even themselves. Therefore, growth mindset people are more likely to take risks and succeed because risks, according to them, are opportunities to change and to develop. After painting these kinds of mindsets, in following chapters, Dweck explains the influences of mindsets in several aspects of life such as sports, business, educations, etc. She gives a lot of case studies, drawing from her researches over years, to conclude that people are easy to succeed with the growth mindsets. This part of the book is where I keep disagree with her while reading her arguments. Dweck tries to explain several failures of sport athletes or CEOs are due ""solely"" to their fixed mindsets. She presents lots of cases of a sport athlete fails because of his complains; business man fails because of his fixed minds. She tries to prove that fixed mindset is an important factors lead to their low performance or wrong decisions. She confirms everything is due to fixed mindsets. Dweck appears to be a victim of confirmation bias (in confirmation bias, we tend to explain everything by our belief in something). I read and keep thinking that arguments in the book would be persuasive with statistics. Perhaps the informal writing styles make it difficult for the author to present numbers.Though I don't disagree with some the author's arguments, I might acknowledge importance messages that Dweck conveys in the book.. I understand the factors that has made me setbacks. I could see that my mindset tends to be fixed in some tasks and to be growth one in other tasks. For tasks with fixed mindsets, I have not know the way to improve myself until I read this book. Now I understand that If I change my mindset and start something for improvement, I could grow. Educational knowledge is also valuable that I dream of applying them to my children."
88,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3760321-gauri,4,"I believe that this book has made a large, positive impact on me. I was wary of this book being a self-help book without much substance, or one that stretched dubious or minimal research. For the most part, this book is neither of those things. The most common complaint people have with this book is that they feel Dweck is 'shoe-horning' her concept of fixed-mindset as the solution to every human struggle. I don't believe that she is implying, or at least, believes strongly, that a change in mindset is the only and most powerful thing that helped people achieve success. I think that Dweck is saying that mindset is the first step in reaching improvement, and without completing that first step, reaching the end goal would be futile or immensely difficult. Fixed-mindset occurs when a person believes that their character, their skills, their intelligence, and who they are as a person are all unalterable and a source of one's genetics or upbringing. When a person believes that they cannot become any better than who they are, they try to prove to themselves and others that their innate qualities are already of great caliber. This prevents people from improving these qualities and becoming better people. Their relationships, their education, and their careers are all negatively impacted by their lack of growth and stubbornness to change their flaws. This is the reason why the idea of fixed-mindset is so applicable to any human struggle: if you believe that your brain is plastic enough to change who you are, how you behave, and what you know, then you have taken the first step to improve your flaws. In addition, believing in the fixed mindset also impacts your view of others. If you believe that people cannot change and improve, then you can hinder others' growth. Dweck goes far more into depth about this in the book, examining the various ways this sort of mindset impacts us. At times, I admit she could have written fewer anecdotes and shortened her chapters, but I don't believe that should keep you from reading this book. I think that I most definitely have a fixed mindset, and many areas of my life have suffered due to it. Having read this book, I can identify exactly how my fixed-mindset has prevented me from progressing further in my education and my social life, and I am far more determined to improve all of these issues. Stepping into the growth-mindset will allow me to have better self-esteem and confidence to pursue my goals in life, but it will no doubt take a long while to practice and implement into my thought process. Overall: This is a book worth reading. "

Dr. Carol Dweck is a Stanford psychologist and while her observations are helpful, her thesis is way oversimplified!Dweck’s thesis: Our genes influence our intelligence and talents to some extent, but are not fixed at birth. If you mistakenly believe that your capabilities derive from DNA and destiny, then you operate with a “fixed mindset”. The „growths mindset“ on the other hand believe those talents to come from practice and perseverance. According to her, how we are raised and educated has a big influence on which mindset we adopt—and that mindset, in turn, has a profound impact on how we learn and which paths we take in life. People with a fixed mindset would tend to spend a lot of time trying to validate their talent rather than cultivating it. To protect their self-identity as being skilled they often steer clear of tough challenges that might jeopardize that identity. They have little incentive to work hard, instead of believing that basic qualities, including intelligence, can be strengthened like muscles.I criticize that Dweck oversimplifies. Contrary to the impression that Dweck creates, most people neither have a purely fixed-or growth- mindset, but something in between. In some areas we might tend more towards one or the other but the biggest part of the time we believe in the combination of talent and effort.I can find quite a few “symptoms” of a fixed mindset in my behaviors BUT I don’t relate at all to Dwecks definition of the fixed mindset. I don’t believe that our abilities are solely determined by our genes and I also don’t think that procrastination or the loss in motivation for something your bad at is caused by a fixed mindset, but by other factors.On the other hand this oversimplification offers a simple solution = Approach situations with a growth mindset. This is an easy to apply and beautiful thought that might help short term in a situation where you lack motivation.In conclusion I agree with the observations she picked up as problematic for making progress but I disagree with her thesis that those behaviors are solely caused by a fixed or growth mindset as she defines it. Still purposely approaching tasks with a growth mindset is something I will try to do in the future more purposely. It’s an extremely empowering though that can only help."

You could summarize all the book by that quote.It offers insightful thoughts about many situations and ways of thinking, which is very helpful and valuable, specially for those who never heard of it.The book could have been shorter, though. It has a thousand examples of fixed x growth mindset, which is good, but the examples are too many. I believe the length of the book could have been greatly reduced.There are some points where the book is judgemental. I was sort of appaled when I read that you should have a growth mindset to *cure* your shiness, though there is nothing to be cured.Sometimes it evaluated situations superficially, like saying depression is related to having a fixed mindset, ignoring a wide range of other important factors. Even though it says that it is more complex at some point, most of the book sort of ignores that fact and proceeds to make a shallow analysis.Finally, it felt to me that most of the examples are anecdotal. Many are about sports players, musicians and academics. It does sound a lot of people, but, statistically, they'd be irrelevant, so I missed a more statistical, scientific exposition of the arguments rather than hammering your head with anecdotes.The book does have an important message and can help you change your mind, it is true, I just think it could have been shorter, less judgemental and more profound in its analysis.But certainly worth reading. The questions that the book tells you to think about are useful and important in analysing your way of thinking."
92,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3843117-ensiform,4,"The author, a social psychologist, divides people into two types. One has a fixed mindset and so believes that intelligence and personality are fixed traits that cannot change. It follows from this view that effort is to be avoided, because if you need to try you must not have talent; that setbacks reflect personally on you (transference of action to individual); that you blame others or yourself for setbacks; and esteem is garnered through the deprecation of others. The second group is the growth mindset, which believes that intelligence and other traits can be improved on; that success comes through effort; that high standards are a challenge; that flaws should be admitted and faced; that praise should focus on effort, not ability; and that setbacks are not personal. She then applies this mindset theory to show how to deal best with school, teaching, parenting, relationships, and business.Dweck writes in a readable, conversational style with lots of real-world examples and citations from her personal research. There’s nothing earth-shatteringly revelatory here, but it’s genuine; as someone who was praised ad nauseam for my intelligence as a child, I have seen many of these results first hand. Overall it’s a well-reasoned and persuasive book. Unlike a lot of self-help authors, Dweck writes honestly about the lack of quick fixes and the struggle it takes to change into a healthy growth mindset, and gives clear tips on how to do so. This is no pie in the sky psycho-babble; it’s an easy read with powerful, practical advice. "

It helped me change my internal life. Today, finishing this book, I reflect happily and with chagrin at how much more work I have to do to shift my mindset so I can grow to be the kind of person I want to be in the world.Mindset investigates the difference between believing we are only as ______ as we are versus believing we are as _______ as we work to become. Dweck and many peers have done numerous studies, and she makes the case for the relevance of the difference in mindsets to how we grow, succeed, maintain, thrive, and bounce back in areas that range from interpersonal relationships to teachers/coaches/parents, to sports management, to CEOs.I cannot recommend the ideas in Dweck's research enough. You can find them in other formats - in books that reference her (NurtureShock, Drive, etc), in articles (""The Inverse Power of Praise,"" for instance), and in scholarly papers about the research Dweck and colleagues have done. It is powerful and, if you like me have fixed-minded aspects to your thinking, you can choose to use it to help transform your life. Heady stuff, I know. The research is solid and the impact of a mindset switch obvious. I highly recommend any parent, teacher, coach, manager, CEO, friend, or lover who wants new tools and a new paradigm for improving themselves and their abilities to check it out."

But. The growth mindset concept is terrific, and so I really, really liked reading this book. I recognized myself so much throughout all the description of the fixed mindset. Though at times the book made it feel like the growth mindset was this panacea to every ill that plagued us, and was just an easy switch to make it our brains, I think it'll make a difference to how I view the world. It's also a great book to read right before starting a new job - which I'll do in two weeks - because I will definitely suck in the beginning at it, and I'll need to think growth in order to not feel threatened by every helpful hint/outright criticism.I liked how the book talked about everything from raising kids to business to relationships (though there was too much talk of sports for this sports-hater! heh). I had read about how important it was to praise kids' efforts and not their intelligence, but having more examples and more concrete advice on things to say was very helpful, because it is not easy. (My daughter rode a bike for the first time this afternoon after giving up every time she tried before that. I told her I was really happy to see how hard she'd work this time around to suceed. She said ""no, I didn't have to work at all!"" all delighted. More work will be necessary. Hopefully I find someone to praise my efforts when I succeed.)"

It's what separates those who can achieve success - and maintain it - from those who merely want to coast by on their laurels and eventually, fail. This book is a great reminder that there are no short cuts in life.Dweck proposes critical strategies for both adults and children; this is also a great book for parents who want to teach their kids that effort, hard work and challenges pay off in the long run and that natural ability and talent will only get you so far. The info on praising kids is also really helpful. While some are born with natural abilities, it doesn't mean that only they will succeed. The weaker of us, the flawed, can strive to be great and can become even greater than those with inate skills. The major point here is that if someone wants to change, they can."

Yet, I can't overcome my anger towards the way Dr. Carol tries to prove her arguments in the book. Every good theory serves as a lens.

97,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54177141-kevin-suh,4,"Dweck uses Mindset to explain the growth vs. fixed mindset, and how this psychology plays a major role in what each of us ultimately achieves. In short, those with the growth mindset believe they can master anything if they try hard enough. Those with the fixed mindset believe that people are already finished products, and that their abilities are set in stone. People with growth mindset tend to prioritize their learning and development over gaining the approval of others. They embrace failures as learning lessons, and seek out help and honest feedback. In contrast, people with fixed mindset tend to prioritize the judgment and approval of others, since it validates their pre-determined talent. They are quick to judge others, and avoid investing real time and effort into something in fear that they'd be ""exposed"" if they fail.One personally interesting note is that everyone has growth mindsets in certain areas of their life, but not others. This helped me reflect and identify areas that I've implicitly built a fixed mindset in, and lay out the steps I could take to shift it into a growth mindset.This book can be life-changing, but its arguments could and should be stated in far fewer words."

The premise: success is determined primarily by mindset. A fixed mindset limits us and establishes early boundaries that can lead to negative behaviors. A growth mindset lets us continually strive to greater levels of performance. The fixed mindset can become a perfectionist, or they might assume they'll always succeed without effort (and make excuses about the external cause when they don't). It's possible to be mixed, fixed in some situations and not in others (like I am when speaking, but not when analyzing data; or on some days in tennis but not others). I loved the point that you don't always need confidence, as long as you have a growth mindset (p. 52). You can accept that you might not be good at something, even that this is more of a reason to do it. Advice: consider any experience, test, or other judgment that you now use to define yourself. Consider it, feel it, and put it in a growth mindset. Re-frame it as a learning experience. Over time, praise for a specific type of success can be an impediment, even a limiter."

I had always wondered why my gifted and talented students would quit working, or why students who were bright transfered out of my class as soon as I told them they would have to work. The fixed mindset, as Dweck asserts, has done more to limit humanity than oppressive regimes. Thinking you can benefit and grow from putting effort in to what you are doing,the preferred growth mindset,is not as prevalent as one would think. The most interesting section to me was the one on relationships. Those who have a fixed mindset tend to rush to judgment (usually negative) about people and/or situations and then give up or shut down because the relationship takes work or requires the judge to allow for the growth and development of the judged. Fascinating, readable. It gets a little bogged down in the middle and I refuse to give up telling people they are ""brilliant"" if they do something stellar (though that is a fixed mindset response)but otherwise, this book is enlightening and convincing.

I recommend it for any parent, because it is important to know how to praise and encourage your children.

I also learned that if you practice enough, you can become better in almost anything, and need not ever feel some people are ""naturally talented"" and that you are not.I also learned to look at mistakes as a way to learn, not be fear failure, and to expect to be a little uncomfortable when learning something new...that is a natural way to feel. This leads to realizing that when things do not come easily, you just need to continue to work and you will gradually become better at it.The book is constructed to present the basic concept then give examples in different areas of life.

The basic premise is there are two groups of people those with a ""fixed"" mindset and those with a ""growth"" mindset. Fixed is bad, growth is good. Fixed means you are limited by natural talents, growth implies learning and development. Growth requires work. At this point all is fine, then the author in many cases starts engaging in word gymnastics splitting subtleness in word meanings in order to only provide ""growth"" feedback. I'm all for positive growth feedback yet the author continually talks about a nurture only approach. In reality we have nature and nurture and no matter how much nurture is applied there are many cases that nature will apply enough to balance all the nurture; i.e. if someone is 5 feet tall they are never going to be a starting center in the NBA. In reality having a good grounding in ones limits is as important as viewing problems as things to overcome in life. For the most part I view the world through a growth outlook."

I'm starting to see a lot of my interactions with people in terms of how each of us views our ability to improve our skills, and to see how much that lens changes how we perceive our choices. This is especially obvious at school, where people who mainly care how smart they appear fail to progress, but people who ask questions and accept that everyone can improve any skill progress rapidly.One thing I realize I'd love to be better at is humor. I appreciate funny people, I think it's one of the best qualities anyone can have, but I'm very rarely funny on purpose. Maybe there's a book or a class out there to help me be funnier!

Mindset talks about the differences between the growth and fixed mindsets. It goes through all aspects of life - parenting, teaching, coaching, personal - and uses examples from celebrities, athletes, and other important figures. It was really interesting to try and figure out what type of mindset I was and how to change that mindset in my students. This is a great book study book. We used it for a book study at my school. "

The book is generally useful and straightforward, although on several occasions you can sense the selection bias in the cases presented by the author to make her point. I also found the sports / coaching examples to be excessive and hard to relate to for non-Americans. "

141,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85748454-hari-sood,2,Never written 'fuck off' across a book so many times. A book with a punchable face. But one basic good lesson.
142,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19014583-t,3,"I think this might be the lowest rating of any book that's made it to the diverse/interesting learning and life-list books shelves to date.First, the core idea of this book was GREAT. Deeply useful, very thought-provoking, and I think an incredibly important challenge to the idea that we are born with fixed capacities (or lacks) and must live with that. The idea that a growth mindset is better, healthier, more accurate, and more effective and the path to get there are deeply useful and important ideas.That said, I had a LOT of frustrations with this book.First and foremost was that after a short intro of selling the idea the core of the book was an INTERMINABLE list of examples to try and further sell an idea that needed no more selling. It was one of the worst instances of the phrase ""beating a dead horse"" I've ever run across and while I forced myself to listen in hopes value would be there I found very little value in most of it. In retrospect I should have skimmed many of the middle chapters, dipping in only to the subsections that were most interesting, and jumped straight to the discussion of HOW to change one's mindset. If I ever come back to this book (which I well might) I should do that.Side note there - I very much was left wondering if this was a byproduct of having read the ""updated"" edition. There were a few sections in the update that sounded like they might be new and were useful, but I was left wondering if the original didn't have this mess of junk and that was an addition later.Second, the actual discussion of how to change one's mindset was a bit too hokey for me. Does one really have to give one's fixed mindset a name to be able to change it? I doubt that very much, and while many might find it useful, the author's insistence on it being necessary seemed to me like an overreach.Third, the author did spend some early time discussion evidence that a growth mindset is more accurate but I felt like this could have used a lot more discussion. This is perhaps difficult because I'm actually not entirely sure such evidence exists and I am left wondering if that's part of what makes this concept a harder sell, so maybe this is an unfair critique in demanding something impossible, but it did seem overall to me like more effort here would have been merited and would have been vastly more useful than the center 2/3+ of the book.Fourth, there were times in which the growth mindset seemed basically like a panacea version of ""all things good."" It equated to being more motivated in all cases, being faster to bounce back after failures, being more willing to take on challenges, a way to be more disciplined in learning, on and on; at points it felt like an attempt to roll any and all possible virtues into a single concept and now and then that felt like a stretch. It also made the concept somewhat slippery at times in a way that was confusing. That said, one of the updated sections on wrong understandings of growth mindset did seem to address the slipperiness directly in a way I did find useful and while it had the aura of overreach now and then I could never firmly be sure it actually *did* overreach, leaving me even now uncertain whether this is a useful but oversold concept or one of the most useful ways of segmenting the world I've ever encountered.In the end it's probably both; so much of books like this are really about various ways to break down or segment the world and attempts to argue that their approach to understanding is the best. I think some of any such effort likely comes with some overreach, but among such theories this did strike me as one of the most useful of such segmentations I've ever encountered so I'll have to reserve final judgment and simply say I think this is a useful and important concept that's worth taking seriously.So, yeah, lots of caveats/frustrations that detracted from both the concepts and the reading experience, but the core concept and idea are useful/important enough to make the life-list bookshelf; I do think it's something everyone should read/know about."
143,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/769356-andrew,3,"I was talking with my son Dave, an athletic director at a high school in Tucson, about sports psychology. How do you help athletes move beyond a loss or bad performance? How do you help them focus on the next match or game without being dragged down by the past?It suddenly occurred to me that this could have parallels to writer's block. Writers often get stuck. Something went wrong, and now they can't seem to move forward. So I asked, ""What are the best books or resources on the topic?""He suggested Mindset.Generally I shy away from self-help and especially positive thinking books. This book, however, does not simply say, ""Think good thoughts, not bad, and all will be well."" The main proposal is more substantive and based on research that has helped not just athletes but also students, teachers, business people, parents, and writers.The nub of Carol Dweck's idea is that we often fall into one of two mindsets. The fixed mindset believes talent, ability, brains are God-given and there is nothing we can do to improve. If we are dumb or uncoordinated, we are just stuck there. If we are brilliant or talented, success should come easy. In either case, there is no point in working hard. And for both, losses can be devastating because it means I must not be talented.The growth mindset isn't focused on winning. It focuses on improving, on learning. The outcome is secondary. The result? Setbacks become opportunities to get better. We accept challenges so we can grow rather than avoid them for fear we will fail. Criticism isn't a judgment on me as a person but ideas that I can learn from. Those with the growth mindset also tend to do better than those with a fixed mindset. As a lifelong learner, I resonated with this alternative.One of the most surprising applications of this is that parents should not praise their children for who they are, how smart they are, how talented, how skilled. That instills the fixed mindset which discourages effort.Rather, parents should praise children for how hard they try. Not for the grade but for what they learned. Not for the win, but for how they improved. In a way, this book offers the exact opposite of the self-esteem movement.Mindset is a popularly written book with lots and lots of stories. It basically has one idea that it keeps hitting again and again. Whatever research the book is based on is way in the background. Another book on psychology, Thinking, Fast and Slow, is also filled with stories but has dozens of fascinating ideas based on research that is closer to the surface.In addition, Dweck seems to imply that mindset is context-free. It doesn't matter what your circumstances, background or social setting are. The growth mindset works all the time everywhere for everyone. I would have liked more than anecdotal evidence on how this paradigm is or could be effective in underresourced communities. She does offer qualifications a few times, saying not everyone can become a Beethoven or a Michael Jordan but that all can improve. Still the breathless enthusiasm of a true believer permeates the book.What about writer's block? Dweck's work has value in dealing with criticism which can paralyze writers because they see it as a judgment on who they are. ""Obviously, I don't have the talent.""When they change to the growth mindset, they saw criticism as an opportunity to improve. In essence, they thought, ""Teachers and editors are just doing their job to point out errors and weakness. Now I need to do my job by improving my work."" So they did."
144,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53239478-masum-hasan,5,"I consider this book as one of my personal bibles. Few other books touch a topic that is so broadly applicable in personal and professional life. The core message of this book is this, there are two types of mindset in people,Fixed Mindset: the belief in people that our qualities and characteristics as individuals are usually fixed traits and cannot be changed.Growth Mindset: the belief that we can improve almost any of our quality and characteristics with deliberate practice.Sounds simple, but the implication of this goes a long way. People with Fixed mindset usually view themselves and others as a finished product, you either ""are"" something or ""aren't"", you either ""have it"" or ""haven't"". When they do better than others in a test, they think of themselves as brilliant. When they fail at something, they view themselves as losers. They judge other's on the qualities that they ""have"". These are the parents who tell their children to be like someone else's kid. These are the children who are destroyed when they don't top in their class. These are celebrities who think themselves above everyone else and are crashed when they are no longer popular. Success to these people is an arbitrary distance to travel. When they have gone their desired distance, they think they made it, when they haven't they beat themselves up. ""Everyone will see me as a failure if I don't make this amount of money, drive this type of car, or have a spouse who looks like this and that.""Growth mindset gives a different definition of success. Instead of focusing on the distance traveled, it tells us to focus on our growth. In Physics term, we focus on dS/dt instead of S. If an experience helps you grow, that's a success. If you have failed, or made a mistake, and learned something important, that's a success. Growth mindset acknowledges that people are never a finished product, and always a work in progress. And the fundamental of this mindset is the belief that ANYONE AND ANYTHING CAN CHANGE AND GROW WITH EFFORT. Under this mindset, every failure becomes an opportunity, every challenge becomes an adventure. People with growth mindset are not hesitant to take big challenges. If they fail, it does not mean they are a failure, it just means they are not there yet. It's true for learning a new skill, advancing your career, maintaining a relationship, or healing from a traumatic life event. Anything can grow with effort. Dr. Dwek and her team applied these methods to school children, and their results are unprecedented. Disadvantageous schools for Native American children that were taught in growth mindset outperformed the most elite schools in California. So, if you focus on your velocity and not the distance traveled, you end up traveling farther. This book not just tells you what these two mindsets are, also how to apply growth mindset in different parts of our lives: education, relationships, parenting, profession, and many more. My only complaint about this book is that it is longer than it should have been. Highly recommended for anyone willing to improve their life. :)"
145,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/74063582-dan,2,"*read/skimmed for PD* First, (sorry Carol), I think this book is just poorly written. The style is lacking and her case studies are cursory to the point of almost being irrelevant. Still, I can't admit there aren't basic premises of the fixed/growth oriented mindsets, the praise of ability/effort, the focus on high and attainable standards that I found appealing and interesting. As a teacher, ensuring I shape my feedback in a specific way to praise positive effort over natural ability and in working to keep standards high is necessary. HOWEVER, I was confounded by how in a vacuum this book was. Clearly, societal factors (particulars prejudices based on race, gender, sexuality, you name it) reinforce specific mindsets and condition certain beliefs. Yet, these factors are barely mentioned and certainly not given the emotional weight that they deserve. (I didn't come up with this reading of teachings about grit/mindset/etc.) but often times these pop psychology books seem to pathologize a symptom rather than a social disease and ignore the real problems, choosing to invest effort, energy, and importance into ""non-political"" and deeply individualized areas. ""Why focus on system racism that perpetrates ideas of race-based intelligence and instead let's have the kid work on focusing on growth... that's the real problem."" Sure, Carol doesn't claim she's going to solve society's ills, but the lack of social context seemed distasteful to me. Later chapters grew on me, but I can't get over this omission. "
146,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45321954-jens,4,"(Little longer review, since insights as these are what make me enthusiastic about books and I can only hope they do so for someone else too)Absolutely loved the first few chapters. A growth mindset is the belief that practice and effort can always improve our every ability. As opposed to a fixed mindset where one believes you either have it or you don't. The most important consequence is the different way of coping with failure: do you see it as an opportunity for learning or as something that defines your self-worth? As this (failure coping) part of the mindset comes easy for me, it was really eye-opening to read about other parts of the same mindset (I so pride myself on) with which I do struggle. If you don't want failure to define you as worthless, you cannot believe succes came from some superior-worthy ability. This simple consequence is only one example I found really helpful. It may serve as a practical way of reminding yourself of the elusive advice to ""stay humble"". Other takes on how to foster such a growth mindset in children, how to inteprate bullying and how to not favour/focus on the good performers in a group would have easily earned this book 5 stars, if it wasn't for the outdated and exaggerated examples (almost always well out of the previous century or her children-subjects of 10yo that respond the ""perfect growth answer"", yeah right) and the overstretching of the concept (she comes close to saying that an organized, engaged, motivated person is the sole and only possible result of a growth mindset) All in all, highly recommended read to reflect on her words for yourself! (While you're at it, grab the 7 habits of highly effective people of Stephen Covey as well. His talk about the ""abundancy or scarcity mentality"" struck a same chord for me with regards to others' successes rather than your own)"
147,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3633494-laura-leaney,3,"This book was assigned summer reading by the school district that pretty much owns me. I didn't open the book until my last free week of summer, thinking that I'd rather poke my eyes out with sharpened pencils rather than read about another theory or program whose posters and jargon would be the next mandatory ""new"" way to teach. I was pleasantly surprised by the value of the book.I think that Dr. Dweck's ideas about overcoming failure, endurance during difficult times, and learning, are all sound. The concept of ""growth mindset"" versus ""fixed mindset"" feels true to me, although I believe that most people are a combination of both, changing their mindset from day to day or even hour to hour. Additional commentary on this combination would have been more realistic. Dweck's examples - case after case - use both famous people and former clients who show how mindset affects success. Examples include sports figures, CEOs, students, laborers, teachers, et cetera. The bottom line is that ""growth mindset is the belief that abilities can be cultivated"" and that a fixed mindset offers no hope for this: ""Everything is about the outcome. If you fail--or if you're not the best--it's all been wasted."" The theory of fixed versus growth mindset is 5 stars - but I'm giving the book 3 stars because repetition of the examples became a hammer on my brain. Nevertheless, the book has value. If you teach kids or you're a parent, I think you should read something on mindset. There's a great series of videos from Khan Academy that might also be beneficial."
148,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25583320-kim,4,"If your biggest fear is failure, this book might help. I haven't read very many self-help type books where I've said to myself something along the lines of ""I wish I would have read this 10 years ago,"" but this is one. It definitely got me to realize the reason for past failures and how to understand that failures aren't really the problem. Yes, there are some anecdotes and conclusions that seem a bit over-simplified, and yes, it gets a little repetitive toward the end. I could pick at some other little things here and there if I wanted to (primarily in regard to children's psychology and mental health), but it's not worth the effort. I wouldn't recommend reading more than a few pages per day either. It's not especially deep or anything. It's just that anecdotes don't really stay interesting for 250 pages straight."
149,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4732934-kyle-czarnecki,1," So generally I don't write reviews on here because who really cares what I have to say? I have to write a review of this book anyway for my class so I figured why not post it here. (Note: this ""review"" is not the one for my class, this one will include much more blunt observations and colorful language; be warned there will be swears.) I was assigned to read this for a class I'm taking regarding issues in higher education for transfer and nontraditional students, it's a good thought provoking class and I enjoy it. I say this because generally a book such as this is outside of my wheelhouse, I try to avoid pop psychology and self help and never have my preconceived notions been so thoroughly validated. This book can be summed up as simply schmaltzy self help offering quick solutions for type A personalities who have no real need for this book. From the standpoint of writing style this book is a slog and a chore. This book manages to string a bunch of anecdotes into 247 pages of non-help and at no point truly challenges notions or intellect. ""Work hard and persistently and you too will be successful"" is what this boils down to. No shit, nothing earth shattering there. Her writing style is grating and repetitive and makes it damn near impossible to remain interested. Her thesis is flawed in many ways the most egregious being her refusal to acknowledge the societal institutions and constructs that make her ""growth mindset"" a luxury only the rich and successful can enjoy. Throughout the book she attempts to construct an argument that in order to truly learn one must embrace learning for learning's sake and not be tempted by ideas of innate talent. Additionally she makes the argument with a select few studies that people in a ""growth mindset"" will succeed and be happy for it. The problem is that she focuses on internal self help and does not address the fact that a growth mindset is all well and good but is almost impossible to quantify. What good is challenging yourself and falling short when you're penalized for the attempt? The author is a faculty member at Stanford University and Columbia, obviously she has had tremendous success and is surrounded by equally successful people. In the book she describes her incoming graduate students with ""top GPAs"" and the molding she has to do to put them into the growth mindset, what she seems to miss is that perhaps the candidates who are already in the growth mindset might be a little less than ""top GPA"" quality? Did a student challenge themselves with a hard course outside of their major? Did that challenge end with a C grade but a strong willingness to learn and an understanding of difficult material? Too damn bad for that student because someone else has a higher GPA. Until the growth mindset is somehow quantified, trying and failing is a luxury not everyone can afford. One of the most privileged mindsets is that of ""failure is good."" Proponents of character education bandy about terms like ""resilience,"" ""overcoming"" and ""learning from failure."" However what these well meaning educators and theorists, Ms. Dweck included, miss is that the people who fail, get themselves up, dust themselves off and get back to work are generally going to have messy pasts. There will be low GPAs, gaps in employment history, a failed venture or two. As a proud failure myself I can honestly say that failing, adapting and overcoming is a hard and valuable lesson and one that I would never trade, why then do I so strongly disagree with her thesis? Because she suggests no mechanism for which to not be permanently penalized from valuable failures and we now live in a world where jobs, schools and other avenues to prosperity are fiercely competitive. The talented (such as Ms. Dweck) thrive and safely ensconced in her world of academia the author fails to recognize that reality; the stakes are too damn high to try and embrace learning for learning's sake. If the poor student's GPA drops they are in a far greater bind then the privileged student, GPA matters, test scores matter. Nowhere in the book does Ms. Dweck address this fact. Instead she focuses on anecdote after anecdote of people who were going to be successful anyway as some sort of paragon of the growth mindset. A perfect example of this is her canonizing of Michael Jordan. She, along with most of society, believe the nonsensical myth that Michael Jordan was ""cut"" from the varsity basketball team in high school. The reality is that his coach fully recognized his potential for success and decided to play him down for less than one season to develop his ball handling abilities. Michael Jordan was going to be a success no matter what he did or what mindset he was in. This book offers a series of self help mantras and nothing truly substantive to learn and grow. It seems strange to me that I should so strongly hate a book that describes my value system to a tee (the following values being core to me: hard work, persistence, innate curiosity and a willingness to learn and grow as a person) but as stated above we don't need another string of myths and anecdotes feeding the American people the lie that they can be anything. There is a system in place that rewards lavishly innate talent and funnels the pre-determined successful into said roles. What this book missed was an opportunity to have a substantive debate about how best to see past quantifiable test scores and numbers and start seeing people for intrinsic self worth, people are capable of so much when given the tools and mindset, that I wholeheartedly agree with Ms. Dweck, but we need to make those tools available to all.

Also, we kind of cover that in the first hm.. 50 pages then everything after that is examples. SO MANY EXAMPLES - we could’ve but this book down by at least 100 pages & it would’ve been better. So yeah - it’s fine but drags on & is FOR SURE overhyped but it’s not like it’s bad advice. "
151,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1495202-stefanie,3,"Mindset follows the idea that there are two ways people view themselves and the world (fixed or growth) and that we are capable of changing our mindset. Dweck's theory throughout the book is that these mindsets play into how we view our abilities in the workplace, relationships and school. She believes the growth mindset is ideal for healthier relationships and greater potential. Additionally, one should encourage a growth mindset in others - especially if you are a parent, teacher or coach.I agree - how people view success, mistakes and learning and how we raise our children to view these things can make a big difference in healthy living. It is easy for me to get on board with Dweck's point that taking on a growth mindset will better help you to reach your potential and is healthier mentally. The difference between a fixed mindset and a growth mindset is pretty easy to grasp - her infographic at the end of the book (that I am sure you can Google Image) is clear and easy to understand. She pretty much had me on board by the third page and I was ready to learn how to work towards growing and managing a growth mindset at work, in relationships and how I do self-care. Also, learning how the things I say/do can influence others - friends, family, employees, colleagues and children especially - to believe in a growth mindset as well. Unfortunately, Dweck takes her time to get to any call to action and I should have just skipped the first half of the book. First, there is was little evidence that only two mindsets exist. The book just starts off assuming that to be true. Second, I don't remember Dweck sharing much about how a person can have varying levels of the mindsets or that you can have one in how you view your intelligence and another on how you view relationships. If she did, it wasn't memorable. Over half of the book was Dweck trying to sell me on the fact that a fixed mindset is bad and a growth mindset is good... which like I said, she accomplished on page 3. She pulled in references of business and sports to showcase when a fixed mindset brought ruin to a company or athlete (Enron, IBM of the '90's, some tennis player I had to Google) and how a growth mindset brought success (IBM since President Clinton, Michael Jordan, Tiger Woods). Examples are great, however it felt more like name dropping as if I should know who all these specific CEOs are and that company's situation. She'd pull out a generally known negative situation - like Enron - and blame it on a CEO of a fixed mindset. Typically her proof that the CEO had a fixed mindset laid in one or two statements that the company’s hiring practices where to hire the elite only or that employees were discouraged from disagreeing with the CEO. I felt her points to be getting me to buy into the idea were not fully developed for me to trust her completely. This first half was a constant stream of example after example. I wish she would have picked a core few and really delve into thoroughly proving the person had a fixed/growth mindset and proving it factored into success/failure.Once we got to the chapter about mindsets in relationships I started to feel the ship turn and that I could start applying this theory to my own situation. Next up was a chapter on Teachers, Coaches and Parents and how to encourage a growth mindset in others. This gave me more tips on applying to my own life – however I still felt these were underdeveloped. At times I felt like she was just telling me what to believe and what to do about it. She’d make statements that sound like fact, but not mention what her resources are (… until you get to the end of the book where she notes her references. Which is great to find that out after having read the whole book… where are the notes in the text?) Also, what about managers at work? I have managed teams in the past where we’d hire young talent on their first or second job out of college. These “kids” are often very fixed mindset – being afraid to make mistakes and judging their success on knowing exactly what to do. I would have loved more insight on motivating them into a growth mindset and making them comfortable learning from what they consider “mistakes.”I started wondering what Dweck’s goal here really was? Was she just giving me just enough to then want to buy a ticket to one of her workshops? Why wasn’t proof in her theory and action more developed? She admits that she is recovering from a fixed mindset herself – was her writing just a product of that? On a spectrum I have more of a growth mindset than fixed and so what I wanted from the text was understanding how to recognize and interact with those of a fixed mindset. Dweck notes the pitfalls of these people, but how do you work with them, how to you trust them? They are people who are confident in themselves and what they believe… how do you maintain a growth mindset and confidence in yourself around these types of thinkers? It seems I was hoping for a different kind of book.You may be surprised after this review that I’d still recommend this book. I do – especially for personality test and psychology junkies and those who want to understand how to motivate others. I don’t think it’s a soul source of helping you understand the varieties in mindset and how to work towards healthy motivation, but I think it is important in a library of work to understand this topic. Those with a fixed mindset will find this book helpful in opening their eyes to a different way of thinking and encourage planting the seeds of change."

Every single person can benefit from reading this book, so I will recommend it to everyone.

But I love and value learning and am excited to learn and grow. Does that mean I have a growth mindset? Maybe. I also think I'm a terrible artist and can't improve. Does that mean I have a fixed mindset? Can I be a combo? Can i become more of a growth than fixed? You bet! And as I'm heading back to school, I'm excited to apply what I've learned in this book. As well as in my parenting, marriage and personal life. This was a fantastic book and extremely helpful! Read it!"

I think it would have been enough to summarise it into an approximately 50 pages book to deliver the point.I was reading ""feel the fear and do it anyway"" simultaneously and it am building a base for a unified idea of the works of the brain (or at least mine)."

It has shown a light on some aspects of my fixed area of my mind that I didn't even know about. I was glad to see areas where I am already in a growth mindset frame of mind.

173,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19341029-aur-lien-thomas,3,"Dr Carol Dweck, 'widely regarded as one of the world's leading researchers in the field of personality, social psychology and developmental psychology', is the psychologist whose famous experiment on school children a few decades ago had led to a ground-breaking understanding of how crucial our beliefs and views about ourselves profoundly affect the way we lead our lives. She is the one, in fact, who has put forward the idea that, people can be roughly divided in two groups - whose with a fixed mindset and, and whose with a growth mindset; where, for the fixed mindset 'intelligence is static', whereas, on the contrary, for the growth mindset 'intelligence can be developed'. Thus, a fixed mindset 'leads to a desire to look smart and therefore a tendency to avoid challenges, get defensive or give up easily, see efforts as fruitless or worse, ignore useful negative feedbacks, feel threatened by the success of others', while, a growth mindset 'leads to a desire to learn and therefore a tendency to embrace challenges, persist in the face of setbacks, see efforts as the path to mastery, learn from criticism, find lessons and inspiration in the success of others'. Put even more bluntly: 'the fixed mindset makes you concerned with how you'll be judged; the growth mindset makes you concerned with improving.'I am sure, we all can think of people fitting into one or the other type of mindset. Since challenging oneself requires efforts and taking risks, some will avoid it for fear of failure (that will question their self-esteem, either too high or too low) when, others on the contrary will embrace it (failure being an opportunity to learn, improve and progress). It's all down, in fact, to attitude:'Those with the growth mindset found success in doing their best, in learning and improving.'While:'(...) in the fixed mindset, you don't take control of your abilities and motivation. You look for your talent to carry you through, and when it doesn't, well then, what else could you have done? You are not a work in progress, you're a finished product. And finished products have to protect themselves, lament and blame. Everything but take charge.'Here's a fascinating take because, more than a divide defining how we perceive success and failures, our mindset appears to be a crucial key in determining if we will be able to unleash our potentials or not. Simplistic as it may sound (I personally see most people as being a mix of both -it's not either/ort but, more a kind of a spectrum and where one stands on that spectrum) such a view nevertheless had a big impact in various fields where individuals' self esteem is involved. That is actually where the book picks up; when the author illustrates her ideas with examples spanning from education to business and, sports to relationships and parenting.Of course, addressing here a wide audience, Carole Dweck's 'Mindset' reads like an easy pop psychology book! But, very influential, her work remains serious and revealing. It is, indeed, a significant read for anyone interested in how our beliefs impact, not only on our attitudes but, also, our achievements. Insightful. "

I was looking forward to read this item, but maybe I waited too long, or had too high expectation.It makes me feeling uneasy, because I agree with the author 100 %. I made almost 200 notes. There is nothing I could disagree with (view spoiler)[(OK, maybe to give a name to your fixed-minded person looks a little bit odd) (hide spoiler)]. So, what's the problem?Usually, in this kind of book, I give 5 stars to books which bring me some revelation, or at least, they are highly inspiring. Mindset doesn't bring me this - it's rather like a checklist: agree, checked, agree, checked...The book covers four main domains, where you could apply mindset: sport, business, relationships and parenting/teaching/coaching. For me, applying mindset in sport and business is too obvious. But maybe, it's just me - I ran a marathon, I worked as a team leader. Work hard and your effort will pay. Mentor (or coach) others. That's it.The relationships and parenting chapters were more helpful and enriching. Especially, the parenting part about labeling (good, or bad) was excellent reminder and guideline. But again, I already know this concept from Czech concept to respect and to be respected (Respektovat a být respektován).Probably the biggest flaw of the book has two roots: First, it's a little bit repetitive (alright, more than a little bit). Second, I would appreciate if the book would be less popular and more scientific - not to far, but just a bit closer to Daniel Kahneman's Thinking, Fast and Slow. I know that the book is based on long time research, but it's too much obfuscated by omnipresent stories.Final words? I would recommend to read Mindset to anyone - whoever you are, a parent, a teacher, an athlete, a boss, simply a person - you can gain. And grow."
175,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3255414-jay,4,"My sister recommended this book to me. She is definitely a growth mindset person and teacher; she found this book very useful in understanding how her fixed mindset students were thinking. She also found that she does have a fixed mindset about some things... mostly artistic talent. The main point of this book is that there are people who believe our skills, talents, knowledge, etc. are mostly set and the things we do are mostly an expression of those talents. ""You can't make someone smarter"" is a fixed mindset thought. On the other hand, there are people who believe that pretty much everything can be learned, given sufficient time and effort. Everything. Yes, even whatever it is that makes you say ""well, surely not..."" And then the author goes on to show what these two different mindsets mean in everyday life. Finally, she wraps up the book by explaining how to change your mindset.I think of myself as a very growth mindset person. I believe that I can learn anything, and that the mistakes I make are all repairable and don't really reflect on my skills. But I do have pockets of fixed mindset, I found. Singing, for instance. I have the idea that my voice is pretty untrainable. Maybe it isn't, after all. The other fixedness I found in my mindset is with other people: I believed that there are people who won't learn new things. In fact, I rather thought myself special because of my ability to grow, flower, fly. I think of adults as getting less limber in their learning. I need to remember that everyone can learn... some people had (tragically) lost the desire to learn new things.I'd give this book a big strong 5 for content. The mindset idea is rather simple once you see it, but realizing it in the first place... that's the trick. There are also many great ideas on how (and why) to change to a growth mindset. What I'd say is missing is the borderline cases. So much of the text covers the black-and-white cases: fully fixed or thoroughly growth. I understand that is an aid to distinguishing the two, but I would really like to have seen a less simple example or two.Overall, though, this is a great book. Especially for anyone who is either (1) in a position of teaching or managing, and (2) anyone who thinks things can't change... that people can't increase their abilities. Actually, it's definitely worth reading, no matter who you are."
176,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1833260-julie,5,"Mindset may very well be the best book I've read this year. Certainly, it's the one that's changed my thinking the most, which is pretty much the point.In Mindset, Carol Dweck explains that people tend to fall into one of two mindsets. The first, the ""fixed mindset,"" is one in which you feel that intelligence, artistic ability, business acumen, athletic potential, etc. are all fixed. You're smart or your dumb. You're a great artist or you're not. And if you're smart, you need to keep proving that you're smart. Every time you fail, it's an indication that you're not smart, you're stupid. So maybe you avoid hard or challenging problems, because you're afraid to fail (and thus admit you're not smart). Maybe you interpret everything as a judgment of praise or of blame. People in fixed mindsets tend to be afraid of failure, addicted to validation, and very stressed.The flip-side of the fixed mindset is the ""growth mindset."" People with the growth mindset believe that things like intelligence or athletic ability can be improved by effort and practice. They often seek out difficult or challenging problems, because these provide the best potential to learn. Failure is no longer invalidating, it's an opportunity to ask, ""What did I learn from this?"" or ""What could I do differently next time?"" or ""How can this failure help me get better?"" Not only does it soften the blow of failure, but thinking in a growth mindset actually helps you improve!Some people have different mindsets in different areas of their lives. Before reading this book, I had a very fixed mindset approach to intelligence and artistic ability (you've got it or you don't), but a more growth mindset approach to karate and cooking. Since reading Mindset, I'm trying to be constantly aware of how I'm thinking and move towards a more growth-mindset approach. I was amazed how invigorating this book made me feel. A lot of times I'd put it down in the middle of a chapter (practically unheard-of for me) to do some task I'd been procrastinating on. It's made me tremendously excited about a number of projects. Just reading a few pages often filled me with energy. I highly, highly recommend this book to just about everybody. You might be surprised to find yourself in the pages."
177,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1860322-elena,3,"Maybe 3.5 stars I wavered between 3 and 4 and was influenced by other reviewers. I read this book as it was discussed at a few faculty meetings in my building and I was intrigued... And I recognized myself in each mind set too. I really think it is very helpful and an interesting way to open your mind about how to help yourself grow, and how to help your children grow (both as a parent and a teacher). I'm no stranger to the idea of praising the effort, the process and helping encourage meeting challenges) I'm a teacher after all....but it was good review. I also found that I fell into fixed mind set thinking of being afraid to make mistakes, beating myself up for making a mistake etc so it was refreshing to see a way out of that thinking. (Side note: that is also often a trait of an eldest daughter....). I plan on incorporating the specific praising strategies in my parenting and my teaching as well. But I also know it's not the end of the world if you compliment something breezily once in awhile.That all being said there are a few other things to consider. I do agree with other reviewed who said Dweck seriously pushes her own agenda, labeling every success/failure anecdote rant she shares as clearly a result of HER idea of either a fixed mindset or a growth mindset. I'm not a psychologist, but I know people are a bit more complicated than that! After all someone who suffers from a deep depression might surely be in a fixed mind set, but it is also a mental health diagnosis that needs treatment! She shares examples of love fixed and growth mind set thinking, and brings up the Clinton/Lewinsky scandal as an example. Coincidentally, my husband and I had been watching a documentary on the 90s and had just been discussing the Clintons marriage scandal and how they are still together. According to Dweck, Hillary has to accept and love bill and see his potential for growth and change and THAT isHow they managed to stay together. Dweck could be 100 percent right about that but my husband and I also discussed how staying together could have been part of a long term political strategy......soooo she could also be wrong. Overall though a good idea, worth the read and worth the reminders to be open minded in thinking and growth."
178,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36574090-muse-ic,2,"2.5Well.....that took forever!And I'm finally done!So at the beginning I was really tempted to give this book 1 star. Part of me is still tempted.However, as the book progressed, it kind of grew on me and I did learn a bit and gain some perspective.Would I recommend it? Yes. But don't read the entire thing. Read only the chapters that would be relevant to your life. For example, I didn't give a crap about the business chapter, because I am not a CEO, nor am I associated with anything business related. You get the idea. The relationships chapter was very helpful because it discussed all kinds of relationship. Boyfriend/girlfriend, regular friends, marriage and divorce, families, and parents.I do have a lot of criticism though. This book is way too repetitive. The entire book is a comparison between the fixed and growth mindset and using research to support the argument that the growth mindset is much more likely to lead to success.And you know what?This book is too long for its own good. So many of the examples she uses are so similar. They ALL prove the same point, but there are way too many of them! This book is a glorified research paper expanded to make money.There is NO WAY--I repeat--NO WAY this professor needed 246 pages to explain what could have been expressed in, perhaps, a scholarly article. She did not need AN ENTIRE BOOK! Ready? This is the opening sentence: ""One day, my students sat me down and ordered me to write this book.""Really? Your students? How come I don't believe that. I doubt they ""ordered"" you or made you do anything. It makes for a cute idea, but it does not have the intended effect in the present context.Also throughout the books she includes thank you letters that people wrote to her, thanking her and telling her how her research and work affected their lives for the better.I get that she's trying to prove her research works, but I definitely think there were some egotistical undertones in this book.Also due to the excessive repetition, it was so goddamn boring! That's why I said only read the chapters that apply to you, because otherwise, you are wasting valuable time and brain cells But anyways, I made through alive! Hallelujah!"
179,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28998992-agenor,2,"This book presents two ideas. The first is that greater success in all areas of life is achieved when people adopt a growth mindset, believing that capabilities can be improved over time, rather than a fixed mindset. In other words, to achieve success you need to believe in nurture over nature. This is because an individual with a fixed mindset will act to protect their sense of self-worth, avoiding challenges in order to avoid failure, rather than seeing them as opportunities for improvement. They are also more likely to be discouraged by any setbacks that occur and take them as an indication that they aren't good enough, rather than thinking they need to put in more time and effort.The second major idea is that as a result, when children are praised for their intelligence or talent it embeds a fixed mindset and so instead they should be praised for the strategies and effort they have used to achieve results. In other words, instead of ""Great job in the game today, you are really good at basketball!"" we should say ""Great job in the game today, looks like your hard work in training is paying off!""However the book is very underwhelming overall. Firstly the author (Carol Dweck) has taken an idea that can be succinctly expressed in a few pages and has turned it into a novel. Second, Dweck exaggerates the importance of her framework, attributing any persons success to having a ""growth mindset"", downplaying the role of natural talent and cherry-picking examples to support her argument. Yes, Michael Jordan worked very hard, but it is ludicrous to suggest that he isn't also naturally talented. Thirdly, her research on this topic doesn't provide any quantitative evidence to back up her claims and consists mainly of ""he said/she said"" which is just poor science and disappointing from a ""world renowned"" Stanford University professor.All in all, I think the two main ideas are mostly right with an important modifier. A growth mindset is probably helpful for reaching your potential in most fields of life. This doesn't guarantee that you will be the best in your field, but you will be the best that you can be. A fixed mindset makes it more difficult to put in the effort needed to realise your potential without being discouraged."
180,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60897821-nguyen-linh-chi,3,"This book is a motivational book rather than a strategic book on how to change your mindset. There are 4 lessons that I can relate from this book:1. There are 2 kinds of mindsets. The fixed mindset asserts that your abilities are set in stone. However, the growth mindset states that you can improve your intelligence and abilities. Growth mindset helps you boost your productivity, contribute to your performance and achieve your future goals.2. Nature or Nurture has remained to be a debatable topic for many centuries. Some people perceive that success comes from natural endowments and they look down on people who make a lot of effort to be successful. As a result, people with fixed mindset think that they are intelligent and they do not need to fix their deficiencies. However, fixed mindset will lead to conservatism and complacency, which results in failure in studying, relationship and business.3. When you are attached to a postive label, you are afraid of losing it. On the other hand, when you are attached to a negative label, you are afraid of deserving it. As a result, we should be cautious when labeling and stereotyping people. When one person is labeled intelligent, he will avoid challenges so that others will not see him as dummy or stupid. When one person is labeled not intelligent, he will give up on working harder to overcome his deficiencies.4. Love is not enough. It takes a lot of sympathy, acknowledgements and communication to have a life-long relationship. Try not to be judmental to your partner.The reason why I rate 3/5 for this book is that although the ideas are dazzling, examples are presented monotonously, especially in Chapter 3 and 4. Many examples seem to be trivial without many applications to real life. Compared to Malcolm Gladwell, he has done excellently in stating complicated examples in a comprehensive and understandable way to every reader.Favorite quote from this book: ""Instead of using the company as a vehicle for their (the leaders) greatness, they use it as an engine of growth - for themselves, the employees and the company as a whole""."
181,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4061006-angela,3,"A good, solid intro to a valuable Life Philosophy! A book about the dichotomy between ""growth"" and ""fixed"" mindsets: growth mindsets praise hard work and effort, fixed mindsets believe some people are smart and others not. LAMBS AND GOATS, PEOPLE. This is definitely something that anyone working in or near academia or other socially-certified ""Smart People"" would do well to read and absorb. I couldn't really buy aalll Carol Dweck's applications; the book covers these mindsets' effects on work, play (sports), relationships. Mostly because this mindset stuff ALSO overlaps with cognitive behavioral stuff, and cognitive errors feel more all-encompassing (to me, at least). But that is a small critique. I did find this v useful, and goddamn do I wish I had had this book both during undergrad (where I did very well and unhelpfully just assumed it was cuz I had DA SMARTZ - but really I never challenged myself too much) and during grad school (which WAS challenging, and convinced me I was A STUPID and had a much smaller ""full potential"" than I previously thought). I noticed how only recently, when I taught myself to code in the privacy and seclusion of my home (boy, was that a game-changer on many fronts!), did I stop my reflexive ""freezing"" whenever something really intellectually challenging would appear, and I could really experience LEARNING, TRUE LEARNING. I'm also trying to apply the growth mindset stuff at work: when someone asks me something I don't know, instead of going into panic freeze mode (""I should know this, shit, what's wrong with me""), I attempt to go into ""I have no idea what you're talking about and don't know the answer, BUT I SHALL LEARN!"". That has been very, very helpful. It is a hard habit to break.In fact, I think the best and most interesting part of this book is its application to pedagogy and learning - a process that is very interesting indeed. And also interesting and heartening (and only obvious once you start losing your fixed mindset!) is how incredibly hamstringing the fixed mindset is, and how much MORE you can get done and how much better you can get at your job with the growth mindset.So yeah. It's good. Learning is fun. Growth mindset-learning is better."

Carol explains that the mindset of individuals from diverse backgrounds may have great impact on the organization or society or even inside the family. Fixed mind set people say talent / intelligence has to be born with them. Whereas Growth mindset people say “Instead of identifying the talent, work on to develop a talent“, and talent is not the one which should be born within us, it is a quality which has to be acquired. Author explains about Lee Iococa, an American Automobile Executive, who had a fixed mindset which ruined his company. He had a over confidence on him and never listened to other’s suggestions. But true self confidence is the courage to welcome a change and new ideas regardless of their resource. Books also covers a case study of IBM happened in late 1980’s. The board of directors where in trouble and within the company there were no team work. They had a royalty syndrome. Few years later new CEO was appointed, he was the one who developed a good culture in American Express. He stopped giving bonus to the individual instead for the team. In relationships, Fixed mind set people blame their partner or themselves for the mistake or for other bad things occurred. Instead Growth mind set people try figure out the problem and fix it together. They even encourage their partner to grow. I came across a term called “constructive criticism” which tells both positive and negative comments in a friendly manner. This type of approach will be very much useful in a company’s growth, or to a child. Final chapter of the book says about changing the mindset. Generally people are afraid to be judged. So instead of judging them, make them grow. Brain is not a mystery, its just like a muscle when we learn more it gets stronger and forms a new connections. Change our mindset to be growing one, there is no use of blaming or being discouraged. No one laughs at a new born baby since it doesn’t know to speak, because it didn’t learn. So its good to say, I am becoming like that instead of I am being like that. Lets decide which mindset we are - fixed or growing. "

You will see exactly how one thing leads to another – how a belief that your qualities are carved in stone leads to a host of thoughts and actions, and how a belief that your qualities can be cultivated leads to a host of different thoughts and actions, taking you down an entirely different road.” p. 10My sister started talking to me about mindsets about a year ago. She is an educator, parent and a loving human being. She had encountered Dweck’s beliefs in her reading and felt I needed to know more about it. She was right. I found Dweck’s basic idea very helpful. People are not born with all their abilities set from day one. However, many believe that they cannot change themselves. Their mindsets are fixed.My life would be easier and more fun if I would remember to see my qualities as something I can change and improve. In my head I know that I can change – every day I read so I can see the world in new ways. Of course, that is the hard part about seeing the world through a new lens. Reading and thinking is much easier than actually applying the research. Even more important is seeing that other people can transform if they choose. As a former people manager, I was not always convinced that change could happen. It was frustrating to deal with people who thought their abilities were set in concrete when they were born. If I was still a supervisor, I would want to get my direct reports to read at least some of Dweck. Her ideas are worth sharing. If more people thought change was possible all our jobs might be easier.This book is interesting, but repetitive. Chapters four through seven all look at mindsets and various aspects of life. I would recommend that you pick and choose what parts of this you read. The first three chapters lay out Dweck’s theories. She gives lots of examples and her ideas are clear. After reading those chapters, I think the rest of the book is optional. If you want to know more about mindsets and business, for example, then read that chapter and skip the rest."

(There you go Carol, praise the process right?)Mindset is a very palatable, very approachable book on high level psychology and the effects it has on our lives; both the detrimental and the uplifting.The language isn’t esoteric, and Carol definitely isn’t trying to flex years of academic knowledge and language - she is, instead, ultimately concerned with making her point as clearly as possible and to as many people as possible for, without a doubt, no other reason than to improve the lives of her readers.Inside you’ll find anecdotes about people’s lives; both heartbreaking and liberating in equal serve. These stories stand to demonstrate the power between two very different approaches to processing the world, and our place within it, when faced with challenges, grief, disappointment, failure or loss. The stories act as paintings of two completely different portraits, and yet underlying this is the message that we, ultimately, are the artist of our own lives and while we may not be able to pick the canvas, we are free to choose the paint, the angle, the style and the time required to paint our own portrait; and that it will take time and effort to execute this at varying levels of success.We all carry a mix of what’s labelled the Fixed-Mindset, and the Growth-Mindset, and as you’ll see it’s not a competition based on where you start relative to others in that ratio, nor a competition with yourself to be perfect.If you ever hold yourself back, despite your successes, or if you feel hopeless and powerless to take control of yourself and become who you are capable of being, then start reading now.You’ll not find strict answers to follow as a recipe for success, nor deep academic information, but you’ll find an encouraging way of looking at yourself, and the world; you’ll be kinder to yourself, kinder to others.If not already, you’ll realise that you, like me, are an unfinished painting and that with time and effort, you can stand tall as a work of art, although never finished, in your own right."

If you have only a certain amount of intelligence, a certain personality, and a certain moral character - well, then you'd better prove that you have a healthy dose of them. It simply wouldn't do to look or feel deficient in these most basic characteristics.""""Th[e] growth mindset is based on the belief that your basic qualities are things you can cultivate through your efforts, your strategies, and help from others. Although many people may differ in every which way - in their initial talents and aptitudes, interests, or temperaments - everyone can change and grow through application and experience.""That’s it. That's basically the entire book in a nutshell.But you know what? This simple revelation has CHANGED me. Just reading about the two different mindsets explained so many things in my life — my feelings, emotions, thoughts, beliefs, certain behaviors — as well as other people’s reactions and perspectives… It’s almost like I’ve been stumbling in the dark for all those years and finally could see things clearly.However, once you are introduced to the two different mindsets in the first few chapters, the rest of the book starts feeling kind of repetitive as it is just a bunch of anecdotes, case studies, and true life stories - some of them grossly oversimplified to prove a point - showing those two mindsets in action in different situations.As a result, I got stuck miserably on the chapter 5, ""Business: Mindset and Leadership."" It bored me to tears and I couldn’t get through it FOR MONTHS! But I'm glad I finally finished the book, as the chapter 6, ""Relationships: Mindsets in Love (or Not),"" was another eye-opening gem."
186,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24105229-yulia-vorotyntseva,2,"I would have given this book at least 4 stars if it consisted only of the first chapter, maybe the first two. The first chapter tells about ""fixed"" versus ""growth"" mindset -- a categorization of person's beliefs about her and others the abilities to change and to develop. These beliefs apparently affect our performance as learners, leaders, parents, etc. Everything is OK so far. The author acknowledges that the ""mindsets"" are just a concepts, the two labels for complex phenomena. And then, starting somewhere from the third chapter, she keeps sticking those two labels on people, mostly those whom she never had a chance to evaluate on her mindset scale.Here is what I mean. Most of the book consists of ""cases"" -- stories of famous CEOs, athletes, artists and coaches. All of them are like ""This guy had a fixed mindset and that's why he eventually failed, and that guy had a growth mindset and that's why he succeeded"". The problem is, the author diagnoses mindsets by biographies and tabloid interviews, and she connects the ""mindsets"" to ""successes"" ex post. The author goes as far as to explain the infamous Columbine School Shooting by the deceased participants ""fixed mindsets"", and she even describes their thoughts and intentions during the tragedy.The biggest problem is, the transitions between documented evidence and author's conjectures is done in a very smooth way, so it is very hard to distinguish between rigor and fiction. Needless to say, she never provides any facts that would cast doubt on her theory or any possible alternative explanations for what she observes. I believe the intention was to make the book more appealing for general public: it is much more interesting to read about Todd Knight than about some anonymous lab research participants. However, as a reader, I felt disrespected.In conclusion, there is no value added after the first two chapters -- only half-fictional stories that exaggerate the power of the author's theory. My advise would be -- read the first two chapters (yes, they are worth it), but don't even skim the rest."
187,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71255069-andrew-h,5,"This book changed the way I think about talent and effort. While listening to this book (a middling 3 stars on the narrator) I thought back to situations where the information in this book could have helped me. There were times that I felt talent was the deciding factor in how good I would be at something, more so than how much time I spent in focused practice. We all have innate attributes that affect our chosen task--the chances for a 7' tall person in the NBA versus a 4' tall person--but these are already set. It made so much sense to me to focus on the factors that we can change and that having a mindset that supports proactive efforts is hugely beneficial.The face validity of the content in some ways makes the book seem obvious. The inclination to think I already knew the material was lessened with reflection on the times when I had thought contrary to the material.There are two main criticisms of this book--the first is that the author makes it seem like having a growth mindset was the sole reason for the success of the people in the examples. However, read the examples given and ask yourself if the people would have had the same success with a fixed mindset, eschewing continued growth and focused practice for coasting on talent. Maybe they would have still had success, but near the same level? I think the answer is obvious.The other criticism is that the material can be summed up in an article or even shorter. This is true, but just like many other nonfiction books, it can take an entire book to fully explore and explain an important idea or concept. A bullet point summary might give you the general idea but it doesn't communicate the importance of the idea.I recommend this book to anyone who is interested in psychology, anyone that has difficulty with consistent practice on a skill, or any person that gives in to the complacency of a fixed mindset, especially teenagers--the perfect confluence of grasping concepts and a lifetime ahead to apply them."

189,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1068161-tryn,5,"The thesis of the book is that people have one of two opposing mindsets: you either believe that people can grow in their abilities and intelligence, even their social skills, or you believe that we have a fixed amount of intelligence and capability. Are human qualities set in stone or are they malleable? You may have a growth mindset in one area—relationships, for example—and a fixed mindset in another area—intelligence or athletics. The more you adopt a growth mindset in every area of your life that is important to you, the more successful you will become. I know from teaching piano lessons that there is growth potential for any student who will make the effort. For some that growth may come faster, but effort—steady, sustained effort—is still required to progress. For some students several strategies will have to be experimented with before the one that fits the student's learning style is found, but musical talent is always possible to cultivate. My mom had us memorize this quote by Emerson when we were young and it has always stuck with me: “That which we persist in doing becomes easier for us to do, not that the nature of the thing itself has changed, but that our power to do has increased.”When approaching something new, people with a fixed mindset feel like they have to be flawless. Things have to come easily to them. That's when they feel smart. If it doesn't come easily, they give up so they don't feel inept. In contrast, people with a growth mindset feel smart when they are learning something or challenging themselves. If something is too easy they feel bored. If something is hard, they say to themselves, “I don't know how to do this yet.” I find myself thinking about this book and discussing it with others often. There is a lot of food for thought here. "
190,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22554752-lilian-kong,4,"In general, I believe this is one of the better self-help books I've read in my life. Perhaps it's because alot of Dweck's advice echoes those of my mother, perhaps it's because I actually believe in most of her logic. She was able to specifically pinpoint some of the not-so-good ways I usually deal with failure (academic and social), which has never happened before. I especially loved the first three chapters as well as the concluding chapter. However, I must say that some of the relationship chapter didn't click with me, and I feel strongly about that. Dweck asks us to reconsider our friendships: to be aware of people who ""don't wish us well"" and be brave enough to cut them off. However, for romantic relationships, she advocates communication and mutual growth, instead of breaking up to escape issues in the relationship. Of course, if both parties are willing to change and have the growth mindset, even big problems should be eventually worked out. Yet, if one member has a fixed mindset either about their own growth, the growth of their partner, or of their relationship, and the other adopts a growth mindset - well, it will turn instantly into a one-sided continuous compromise. One person will remain the same while the other, thinking that they are growing, in fact is just changing his/her expectations/habits/lifestyle around their significant other. That is extremely unhealthy...I wish Dweck could have addressed that gap in more detail. She makes it seem like whenever one party communicates and compromises, the other will reciprocate. In real life, that may not be true."
191,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53647348-olga-shatokha,4,"Generally I liked the book and the ideas. It takes away the pressure of being knowledgeable and puts focus on learning. I’m still bearing the childhood complex that I have to be on top of everything right away. In this sense, the book helped me to see things in a new way and make a step towards being both better and happier person.What I lacked in the book is a deeper psychological research and contemplation on why people are so attracted to fixed mindset, why geniuses and naturals are more lovable that those who achieved the same results by learning and working hard instead of just being born like this. It seems to me that it raises even a bigger question of fatality attraction for humans, and I’d love to know more about our psychological drivers and motivations for that.Also, the book could be more compact. I had audio version and it’s over 10 h, and at some point I was thinking “yeah ok I get it lets please move to the next topic”, but the author kept talking and talking about what was already told before.Lastly, audiobook is read by a gender neutral voice, and I personally didn’t like it - was a bit like listening to a robot."
192,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2179211-eileen-souza,4,"I could swear that I already left a review for this book, but I guess it didn't save.The author, Carol Dweck, has spent her entire career researching failure and it's impacts on us in short and long term. Quite a career, I would say.This book was a game changer for me. As someone who tends towards the fixed mindset, I was able to see in every day life how I was holing myself back just with my own ""perfectionist"" attitude.Not quite as captivating as the Malcolm Gladwell books, it definitely was written in layman's terms, and it was a very easy read.One of my favorite quotes in the book was from math teacher who refused to participate in one of the ""fail"" experiments. The objective was for him to give a test, and then rate the level of intelligence of each of the kids. This would make total sense for a fixed mindset person, but this guy clearly had the growth mindset. He said ""You cannot determine the slope of a line given only one point, as there is no line to begin with. A single point in time does not show trends, improvements, lack of effort or mathematical ability."" Basically, he's saying that you cannot judge who you are or the value of what you do by any single act.I regularly define myself by single acts, and it is a shortcoming on my part. Even after the first chapter of this book, I was recognizing opportunities for change in mindset in myself, and looking at the world in a different way.I will read this book at least once a year to help me grow and develop."

I am, or hopefully was, one of those students with the fixed mindset she describes in the book. I've been told that I'm smart, intelligent at the young age. As such, I believe that I must be, since my parents keep telling me so. This is detrimental toward my attitude toward school and learning, as I started to see learning as something done to gain approvals and get good grades. This makes me shun challenges, just as the kids Dweck studied. I only studied the bare minimum required to get a good grade. Basically, I only studied what the teachers said will be on the test and so on. I often crammed for tests and finals, thinking if I study beforehand, that's trying too hard and that means I'm not as smart as I believe. Sometimes, I get lucky with cramming at the last minute and managed to do well but for the most part, I did not get good grades or learn much from my classes. This book explained so much of behaviors and my aversion to actual, genuine studying. I'm currently in the process and reforming my mindset not just toward learning in school but toward learning everything, including trying to change my moody temperament. The one area my psyche is still resisting toward changing is the relationship department. My view toward it seems to be very black and white still. Hopefully, as I start to see progress and the benefits of adopting a growth mindset in other aspects of my life, I can start to learn manage the relationships in my life in a more effective and proactive way."

This narrates about the mindset in different scenarios like business, workplace, students, teachers, children, parents, relationships and more. In this whole book in all the scenarios Carol described in two categories FIXED MINDSET and GROWTH MINDSET. In the chapter 3 a very important point was narrated in regard of TESTS for the students - Test scores and measurements tells where the student is but it doesn't tell where the student end up. And Flat mindset limits the opportunities. Success in terms of Fixed mindset is staying at the top - character of an individual makes the person to stand in the top and stay over there, Success in terms of growth mindset is thinking and achieving the goals they have with doing number of practises to achieve the goal. Failures are like downs and success are like ups to the fixed mindset. In the chapter 7 they clearly explained mindset of parents and children - The mindset of parents teachers and cultures, no parents thinks that their child should also do the same what they do in a day, they make the child to learn and explore and they give everything for their children's success, every word in the action has lesson. Children with Fixed Mindset says that he is being getting judged and the growth mindset says he is learning things and developing. And the most important point in the whole book is - ""Beware of success it can knock you into fixed mindset - I won because I am talented therefore I keep winning. Success can infect the team or an individual."""
195,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32578543-ali-haq,4,"A very important concept/idea regarding how much happier and successful a growth mindset can make someone, in comparison to a fixed mindset. I found myself relating to many of the ways the fixed minded examples responded to hypothetical situations in her book, and have actively caught myself in that frame of thought in order to address this mindset. While I believe this shift in mindset could definitely be beneficial, and mindset is no doubt important (it's ultimately the way that you perceive the world around you!), the book does stretch itself a little too thin at times. For example, there is a whole chapter devoted to athletics, and while it's an interesting application at first, the stories drone on and on with very few differences (spoiler alert: it's either a story about how a growth minded athlete succeeded, or a story about how a fixed minded athlete failed). I almost couldn't get through the book because of how repetitive it becomes in the middle. Thankfully, the book does pick up near the end, but I feel like this book would have been a lot better if the fat from the middle had been trimmed at least somewhat. Nonetheless, the main ideas revolving around the juxtaposition of the growth/fixed mindset are very useful and applicable, and I can't knock Carol Dweck too much for wanting to hammer the point home by using as many examples as she could. Definitely a good read for those who want to change their approach to the world, just remember it's probably okay to skim some of the more grueling chapters in the middle!"
196,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20176950-steffan-bard,4,"I started reading this book somewhat skeptically - due to all the hype and recommendations. In particular, I had heard that this book, like many, could have been a pamphlet rather than a whole book. I will say, I had to swallow my initial skepticism and admit that it was worth the read after all.(Since I loaned this from the library, I actually wrote down the sections I would have underlined in my ""updates"" section on the book. I think you can view those below and probably glean a lot of the powerful/key concepts of the book.)My main criticism would be that the plethora of anecdotes end up feeling redundant in some points, for me it was the section on sports, though I've been a lifelong athlete, I'm not necessarily passionate about sports and so I found myself sort of skimming over the many examples after awhile. And they didn't seem to be adding much more to the thrust of the concept past a certain point. I'm not sure if the anecdotes were more redundant in the sports section compared to the other sections later on or if it was a matter of my level of interest in the section/subject. I found that the overall concept of mindset fleshed out by the other section's stories were easily translatable to the other sections generally. For instance, reading about mindset with business leaders translated in my mind to how coaches, as leaders, affect a team. I did find the analysis of John Wooden as contrasted with another coach to be very insightful and interesting though.I found the examples more powerful and helpful in the sections on business in particular and parenting. I recall one example moved me to tears because it unearthed a part of my childhood through the story. A deep part of me could relate to the 6 year old who had ambivalence over whether to adopt the fixed or growth mindset because one parent embodied one and the other embodied the other. He didn't know how to view his mistakes, even if they were innocent and a natural part of learning. Were they a sign of his inability and lack of worthiness? Or were they just a part of the learning process in which he was doing his best at? That little story resonated very deep with me.Additionally, the way leaders and bosses' mindsets affect the work culture was very insightful to me and relatable. The specific differences that one will experience in work culture based on the mindset the ""higher up's"" have was very insightful. In particular, I remember the explanation that in a work environment where a boss has a fixed mindset, he actually sets out to prove the inadequacy of those under him, for instance by rejecting their contributions or ideas even if they are good, because in the fixed mindset, if those under him have legitimate contributions then that means they are ""better"" than him or have more inherent ability than him and that thus threatens his sense of worthiness to have his superior position in the company. Additionally, a boss or coach or leader with a fixed mindset will naturally fall into an authoritarian leadership style - ""my way or the highway."" He cannot admit his mistakes, because those would reflect on his inherent abilities and thus worthiness to hold the position he does. As a result, nor can those under him safely admit their mistakes and actually engage in the processes that allow companies or teams to grow and move forward. Nor can those under him take creative risks.As a person who naturally has a lot of creativity and tends to see through to the structural roots of the problems and obstacles holding a team or business back, I've had a lot of painful experiences struggling to be myself and to thrive in authoritarian and fixed mindset cultures. So I found those sections to be very validating. I wish there were more growth mindset leaders and business cultures out there! The fixed mindset is ultimately self-defeating in a work culture because it focuses doggedly on results while neglecting the quality of the process.My most powerful personal experience of this was the difference between the two soccer coaches I had in college. The first one was very micro-managing, technical and authoritarian and based a lot of an ideology of reward/punishment. Sort of like, ""The punishments will not cease until the morale improves."" The focus was largely on the outcome because that reflected on his ability as a coach. But this made our team's morale sink lower and lower and it was not safe to experiment, be creative or make contributions or suggestions for improvement. Though we had many skilled players (he was good at recruiting) our team consistently underperformed for the three years he was at the helm. At one point, it was very awkward because I felt like everybody could tell what was going on. We had so many players quit because it wasn't fun to play for him. I actually tried to reason with him and speak up but I ended up getting punished for this, unsurprisingly in retrospect. And that sort of put me on a ""blacklist"" in his psyche as a threat and so my college soccer career ended up suffering as a result of that and by time the new coach came in I had somewhat lost my confidence after toiling for three years under the first coach.In contrast, the assistant coach who eventually became the head coach was encouraging and you could feel a passion from him about the game. It wasn't just about winning and losing or the mechanics of it. He wasn't a pushover, but he didn't use the same reward/punishment style of leadership. Perhaps you could say, by analogy, he used more ""carrot than stick."" And it worked! The team's morale and enjoyment of and passion for the sport improved so much and as a result so did the outcome of our games. It was fun to play soccer again and so our creativity and work ethic came out but from a place of desire and inspiration rather than fear of punishment or losing. The first year he stepped in as head coach we actually won the championship, finally, my last year of playing in college. It was such a night and day difference. I'll never forget it. I now see that this experience was a powerful anecdote of the difference between the culture of a team under a leader with either a fixed or growth mindset. It remains a big life lesson for me and reminder of how I want to interact with others and be a leader when I am in that role.Perhaps my final note would be that we need to have a growth mindset towards our fixed mindset. Which I think Dweck explains somewhere. It is an ongoing process to untether from the ways we equate performance and inherent ability and to risk stepping into the growth, humanity, creativity, risk and uncertainty that letting go of a fixed mindset and stepping into a growth mindset requires. We have to focus on the process over the results. And that's hard to do if our consciousness is dominated by fear and thus control, striving and performance."
197,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6088206-kory-ching,3,"The good: this book contains the nuggets of some important ideas about motivation and learning. Dweck explores the differences between ""fixed"" mindset and ""growth"" mindset, using research to help readers understand what those look like and what their consequences are. I came to this book as a parent and educator, and it certainly helped me think through some of what I see in students and my own children. An unexpected side-effect was that this book helped me reflect on my own mindset(s). The not-so-good: I hate saying this about an academic, since it's kind of a cliche, but this book isn't terribly well-written. The problem isn't that it's dry and boring—a critique often leveled at academic writers—but instead that it tries too hard to be one of those ""intellectual"" popular press books, a la Malcolm Gladwell. Even that wouldn't be so bad, except that this book simplifies (and over-simplifies) without realizing a subsequent boost in entertainment value. This book also falls into the trap of repeatedly illustrating the same proposition (fixed mindset vs. growth mindset) without really evolving or complicating it over time. Anyway, the ideas in this book are important, and parents and educators should take them seriously. It's possible, though, that the contents of this book could be compressed to a fairly breezy TED talk without losing too much of what's here. "

199,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/975611-tara,3,"Someone made me read this book, and I'm glad I'm starting it.The messages are relatively simple. ""don't praise children/people for their ability,"" but instead ""praise them for their effort."" If something is easy, then make it fun and challenging, that's how you learn and grow. If you face setbacks or challenges, find strategies to help you improve.If you have the ability, or strategies but do not believe in growth or learning, they don't help.Overall, the message is to maintain a growth and learning mindset. It's great to see studies showing the effect of having both talent and effort, and not just either / or (it's not nature against nurture, it's nurture or both that matter).Several examples showed having the ""growth mindset"" help people to fulfill their potentials or become more successful. This might be true in sports where practice is important, but here, some examples are just a bit forced. This is the one thing I didn't like about this book. I've read of leaders who didn't necessarily came from ""growth"" mindset parents/parenting but still became very successful, so I'd attribute the ""success"" stories from this book as confirmation bias by the author.Also, the book didn't need ~250 pages to convey or repeat its message. The gist of it can be found on Wikipedia."

I am always looking for ways to expand my capabilities, learn, grow, and stretch. This book is all about just a single concept of identifying the differences between a fixed and growth mindset. It sounds simple and self evident, but it is not. At least is was not for me.The context that this book sets is a terrific new frame of mind to approach how you handle failures, setbacks, challenges, and relationships across all aspects of your life (business, personal, family). I will raise my children differently after reading this book. I identified certain key aspects of my personality, their apparent permanence, and exactly how they were formed down to the moment in my childhood. There were many areas where I identified a fixed mindset and how it served me very well, but also limits me.After doing my best to influence my closest friends to read this book, I discovered many already have and with glowing reviews. I finally made it to the game, but I'm here. If you want to uncover why you identify with very specific character traits, this book will enable you to discover where you put them on yourself and enable you to change them if you want to.I save the 5 star rating for those exception books, this is one of them."
201,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1618357-jay,3,"This book was being read by a group of co-workers, so not wanting to be left out, I read it as well. The concept was interesting – people can put themselves into two different mindsets, a fixed mindset or a growth mindset. Interestingly, these two mindsets weren’t described as being diametrically opposed, and I think that is what makes this an interesting concept. And you can easily see yourself in both of these mindsets in different situations. And you can see others as well. I was a bit taken aback by the author mapping her descriptions of mindsets onto the plot of the movie “Groundhog Day”. It seems quite true to her descriptions, and made me wonder if perhaps, despite her insistence otherwise, the author got the idea from the movie. Very odd. The book contains many stories, examples of the different mindsets at work. Some are taken from TV shows and movies, while most are from real life. This is a very media-friendly book and I believe it will appeal to those big on pop culture. Given there are only two mindsets, one that most would consider good with the other mostly bad, this didn’t feel very deep. But I will think of these mindsets when I talk to my kids about their classes. It seems like coaching learners to be in a learning mindset is a safe bet. Kudos to the author for describing the need to occasionally kick yourself or others into learning mode."
202,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/793094-lisa,5," The main idea of this book is that everyone has either a fixed mindset or a growth mindset. A fixed mindset is one in which you view your talents and abilities as fixed or set. In other words, your intelligence and talents are fixed, and your fate is to go through life avoiding challenge and failure.  A growth mindset is one in which you see yourself as a work in progress. You can work hard or learn to improve. The good news is that mindsets are not set. At any time, you can learn to use a growth mindset to achieve success and happiness. Dweck's overall assertion is that rigid thinking benefits no one, least of all yourself, and that a change of mind is always possible and welcome. I was going to give this book 4 stars, but really appreciated the value of this book when I discussed some of the ideas with my 14 year old son. He took the book and read most of the book. I had forgotten about the book until tonight when he brought it up and explained the mindset of one of his friends. It's good to be smart, but it's even better to be a really hard worker. As you work hard, you will improve yourself."

For example, when I mess something up, I might say, ""I'm so dumb,"" but that's not what I mean. People make mistakes. This book is about allowing the people the grace to grow. She stresses that comments for students should emphasize their efforts and not their ability. So in reading a student's writing you might say, ""I like how you used what we discussed in class about diction to choose a word like this,"" instead of ""Great word!"" This concept permeates every area of one's life: how one relates to friends and family, stereotyping and bias, overcoming obstacles, learning new skills, and coping under stress. Dweck says we should stress growth and learning for students to help them develop this mindset. However, grades are usually fixed. I have some colleagues who grade based on growth, but I'm not sure if that's the best either. A student may grow a lot, which is important, but they still may not be able to do what they should be able to do. How do you balance celebrating growth with the honest reflection of standards attainment?"
204,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1291116-dana-desjardins,3,"Dweck astutely asserts that one's expectations often determine results. She advocates for a ""growth mindset,"" which accommodates change as the impetus for growth rather than reactive self protection. This is not new. What is new is her belief that if people become aware of which areas in life they approach with a fixed mindset, they can adapt a new growth mindset to re-frame their expectations. The best part of this book is its insistence that adults and people in charge praise effort rather than talent. Congratulating a child on working hard rather than being intelligent establishes a template for success. People who think their intelligence and talents are static and hard-wired are defeated more easily and view their setbacks as inevitable. Other people, who attribute success and failure to experience and effort prove more resilient in the face of disappointment. Dweck presents case after case as variations on this theme. Unfortunately, the same theory could be proven in a good, long article. This book is worth reading, especially when one is trying to change results, but reading the first few chapters is persuasive enough. "

On the contrary, people with a growth mindset work hard and train hard to ultimately realize their potential to the fullest. By confronting our own attitudes and ideas, we can develop a growth mindset.The questions this book answered:How do people differ in their mindset?Our mindset shapes whether we believe we can learn and change and grow – or not.An individual’s abilities are set in stone in the fixed mindset.Growth and development are possible in the growth mindset.What impact does our mindset have on our behavior?People with a fixed mindset seek approval; those with a growth mindset seek development.The fixed mindset sees failures as disasters; the growth mindsetsees them as opportunities.People with a fixed mindset avoid difficulties; those with a growth mindset relish them.Can we change our mindset?Our mindset is often strongly influenced by the role models we had as children.Anyone can adopt a growth mindset and make the impossible possible."

We parents were invited to participate in class discussions of the book. I've read many reviews of Mindset, and those from people who appear to be students, even in college or grad school, dismiss it. My daughter's classmates for the most part found it to be quite repetitive, and could not relate to the chapters on parenting and business. I was intrigued by the chapter on sports figures, and found it personally challenging as well. It's easy to fall into a ""fixed"" mindset in so many realms, and I realized that I see it most often in politics! But I believe her main target is those in the business of education. The stories she shared of changes occurring in that sector were remarkable. And since we're all better off as lifelong learners, I would therefore recommend this book - especially to people old enough to be parents and grandparents. If teachers, professors, and coaches at all levels learned this style of instruction, we'd realize that our educational system doesn't really need more money thrown at it."

And I highly dislike this book's cover because it reeks of typically hollow, feel-good self-help material aimed at turning a profit. The title is also unfortunate - perhaps The Growth Mindset (with no cheesy subtitle) would be more descriptive and memorable.Dweck's theory of the two mindsets - fixed and growth - makes a lot of sense to me. And as one reviewer here says, those who love this book probably belong to the former group. I'd encountered Dweck's ideas before in bite-sized portions, and was pleasantly surprised to find so much more clarity and insight in the book. The sharing from her own life was especially refreshing and engaging.I didn't love everything. Most of the suggested phrases for praising and communicating with others sound unnatural (though the point is clear), and the text does get repetitive (but I see who the additional examples may be helpful for). Still, my mind is quite shaken and I feel as if some of my deeply rooted mental blackheads have started to be dislodged. A gospel worth sharing."

The minimun that I expect from anybody who saying that intelligence is not innate, and that it can be improved, is neuroscientifical, philosophical and psychological arguments, which the books barely provide.It is a simple summary of a mental model regarding biological determinism about intelligence. Although I agree with the main idea of the book, I believe it is poorly supported by arguments. I'd like to get indepth of the function of intelligence and mind rather than superficially mention studies and numerous sports examples. I found better judgement reading about Cognitive Science and basic functions of the mind in order to develop a criteria to know how intelligence can be improved. In addition, I found two highly insightful previous studies that might perfectly replace this book with better scientifical support: The Bell Curve, from professors Richard Hernstein and Charles Murray; and The Mismeasure of Man, from Harvard professor, Stephen Jay Gould. Both research books contrast each other in the hipothesis of innate and measurable intelligence. "

I strongly feel that it is an important book (or at least an important psychology) for educators, coaches, parents, and mentors to understand. The idea that we can become better--great, even--with hard work and dedication is extremely important to pass on to the next generation and I wish I could've had at least a small lesson in this when I was 10 years old. I was definitely one of those kids told she was ""a natural"" and that certain subjects came easy to because I was smart (therefore wouldn't have to try hard or work). And true to the textbook, I became afraid to fail and afraid of showing effort. I hope that I can inspire my children to take risks and opt for the hard choice if it's something they really want--I hope that I can encourage them and myself to enjoy the journey and the challenges that life offers. I hope we can have a generation of children all over the world who aren't afraid of hard work or challenges. Highly recommended. "

I was afraid that working at it would show that I wasn’t truly gifted. But now That I am aware that my gardening can be developed I can start growing again, literally and figuratively.I had a growth mindset towards learning new skills in math and science. Having struggled since youth I kept going on to new avenues and was recently told I’m valuable because of my intelligence (disputable), diverse interests, and abilities.

Turns out it was both good and bad reommendation -- the good -The first 3 Chapters are fantastic. She really nails down the idea of Growth/Fixed Mindsets. There are many moments where you will be going through these chapters and find something completely relate-able (at least I did). The concept really does motivate you to do better.- the bad -  If chapter 4 were just a a closing summary of the entire book, I would have been just as satisfied. I had a hard time focusing in the middle of the book because it was simply repetition. The last 2 chapters were better than the mid because the content varies a little more drastically. - in short -I give 5 stars to the first three chapters, and 2 the rest (with bits that rose up to a 3). I do have to say that this book did instill a good habit in myself, so there is something to gain.

People with this Mindset are likely to plateau early and achieve less than their potential. This Mindset represents a very Deterministically View of the World!2) A GROWTH MINDSET - meaning that Intelligence can be developed which leads to a desire to learn and therefore a tendancy to embrace challenges, persist in the face of setbacks, see effort as the path to MASTERY, learn from criticism, and find lessons and inspiration from the success of others. This Mindset drives a higher level of achievement and gives a greater sence of FREE WILL!The reference research is great in this book and it should be REQUIRED READING AND STUDY FOR ALL TEACHERS AND PARENTS"

Only, the readers are not Carol and are not the benefitting from mistakes. I am doubtful of magical cases where a single sentence or paragraph magically changed everything.* Testimonials in a book are like an author on Amazon writing his own reviews. Only the positive results are indicated. Which, is funny given the growth mindset being advocated in this book is about learning from mistakes. Yet the author's mistakes in this work are hidden.I spent too long frustrated by the Self-Help nature of the first 300 pages to enjoy it.

Exploring this through various lenses, such as business, personal relationships, childrearing, coaching and education, Dweck shows how a growth mindset can be cultivated in oneself and in others through very small ways. Just by changing how you praise someone can make a huge impact on how much they are willing to work for something and how they view their own abilities and potential. Tell a child, ""You're so smart!"" can make them question their intelligence and make them not want to take risks, while instead saying something like, ""Wow! You worked so hard an look what you've accomplished!"" can have the opposite effect. Pretty fascinating.That said, this book has no narrative: it is example after example of growth vs. fixed mindset in action, which is great, but definitely gets repetitive. I found myself skimming and wanting to move on to the next chapter.A worthwhile read for educators and managers."

Dweck identifies two mindsets: fixed and growth. Imagine a toddler just beginning to walk, just beginning to talk. The perfect example of a person with a growth mindset, the toddler has nowhere to go but up. There is no fear of failure, only the hope and determination that accomplishments will be made. But Dweck has conducted research on groups of children, praising one group for being smart and one group for being hard workers. When faced with the choice between increasingly difficult challenges and easy tasks, those who've been praised for being smart choose the easy tasks. They don't want to fail and disprove our theory about how smart they are. On the other hand, the children who have been praised for being hard working choose more frequently the task that will provide them with a greater challenge. One of the most life-changing books I have read in a long, long time."
216,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50769-katy,5,"Carol Dweck condenses years of research and experience into one book. Her ideas are clear and supported by anecdotes and research. Dweck suggests that our mindset determines our quality of life, but no surprise there. However, she suggests 2 different mindsets for approaching life: fixed and growth. Those with a fixed mindset believe that intelligence is static. They desire to appear competent and smart, avoid challenges, and view their circumstances as affirming or demeaning their intelligence. Those with a growth mindset believe that intelligence is gained through effort and seek out challenging situations.I experienced a paradigm shift while reading Mindset. As a product of the 'self-esteem' movement, I recognized negative side-effects like avoiding challenging situations or evaluating the experiences of my life as proof that I am 'superior, inferior, etc.' I would recommend this book for anyone who enjoys a good psychology/self-help guide or who is hard on themselves. Great book, a bit redundant, but I purchased it."

The fixed mindset relies on a belief in innate IQ and talent that we spend our lives proving. The growth mindset relies on the belief that whatever we start off with, we can always continue to learn and grow. This was assigned professional reading for teaching my gifted and talented students. While teachers can easily see how low achieving students are affected by an unwillingness to risk when they are convinced they are stupid, it is often more difficult for us to see the damage done to those who have been overpraised for their talent and intelligence. I often encounter students who are unwilling to risk or to do anything that doesn't come easily because that topples their identity as the smart kid who doesn't have to work. I spend as much time contending with the fixed attitudes of the smart students (and an occasional parent) as I do teaching.

The author frames this as if this was some new type of discovery. Most of the wisdom and knowledge in the book has been stated elsewhere. I really got the sense that the author is a huckster trying to pass this off as some new discovery. There's not really much advice about how one can improve yourself, other than trying to learn from your experiences and being humble and a number of other little things that you can find lots of places. The discussion of sports is problematic all the way around. For example, she cites Michael Jordan as the ultimate team player. But remember when Tex Winter told Jordan that there is no ""I"" in team? Jordan's response was that there is an ""I"" in win! And it's incongruent to criticize some great champions like McEnroe. He may have been a jerk but he was one hell of a tennis player and a champion.

People should embrace failure, learn from it and become better, rather than be miserable, try to express that they are brilliant, beautiful, blah, blah… Well, good idea, right attitude but maybe the author is so in love with her idea that she does not consider developing it to more practical tool. All the content of the book is to show how great people with growth mindset can do, how amazing to have a growth mindset. I have to say I totally agree with her from the beginning of the book, but I really expect something more than just repeat this fact. I have been already persuaded, now I need more tools on the way becoming a growth mindset. No useful breakthrough new tools are offered here even in the last chapter (well, I skip the middle chapters and jump to the last).Maybe I will scan the book one more time to find whether I could find something different before deciding to stop reading the book."

The fixed mindset, which is the thinking that intelligence and capacities are static and can't be developed in the future. Two examples: 1. When a kid thinks that he IS stupid because he doesn't get good grades. 2. When a kid thinks that he is smart and doesn't have to study, because studying is for stupid people.2. The growth mindset, which is the thinking that intelligence and capacities can grow in the future. This is found in people who work hard to achieve their goals and grow their intelligence.The case is very well argumented, and applied to very different situations in life: leadership, parenting, schooling, etc. However, Dweck becomes a little eager at moments, and tries to justify a lot of hitorical successes and failures using her theory. But I think this doesn't overshadow the rich theory she developed.I strongly recommend this book to anyone, specially early parents, those who have people in charge, and students of any kind."

Dweck (author ) classifies the human mindset to be either a fixed mindset or a growth oriented mindset. The growth mindset opens the door for plenty of opportunities to learn and grow anytime and hence making it a learning mindset. The fixed mindset can always be tuned leading to a direction which ensures growth for an individual.The fixed mindset restricts us to ""be"" in a position and not to ""become"" by using our potential and the author highlights beautifully that becoming is always better than being. The human mindset is engaged in several activities such as childhood learning , relationships , business and so forth. It is important to nourish our mind in a way that always guides us to promote creating opportunities for learning and improvement.

I appreciated Dweck's chapters that detail what a growth mindset looks like in business, in the classroom, in coaching, and in parenting. She had concrete and relatable examples in all of these areas.As I listened to the book, I found it to be a fantastic reminder for myself. I'm heading into a new position, in a new school and I need to remember that it's going to be a learning process. There's so much that I don't know and that's okay - I'm learning. Honoring that process is vital. Learn something new each day. I'll get there.I also found the book to be a great reminder as I think about my role as an educator and a librarian. How do I live out that growth mindset with students who visit the library? How do I express the growth mindset with dormant readers? How do I come alongside of teachers and students in their learning processes and support them in ways that encourage a growth mindset?"

However, the idea that anyone ca succeed if only they stick to their goals and make a joy out of the learning process instead of focusing on the grades, results and other meaningless things is empowering. This helped me believe I can learn the parts of my business I think I'm not good at (sales, marketing, technical parts of my website, analytics). Knowing what one should do to cultivate a growth mindset is freeing. I'll certainly apply the tips she gave towards growth at the end of the book. It is a really good book so I can recommend it to anyone struggling to achieve small goals or bigger ones. Remember that even intelligence can be taught.

What I would have liked is a bit more on the science, more support for the statement that intelligence (as the book calls it, maybe confusingly, or maybe I missed something) can be changed. I'm not so sure about that, baseline intelligence seems to have a strong genetic component as well, and this discussion was sort of missing or seemed anecdotal. I mean I believe in the abilities of my students, BUT in its cheeriness the book distorts the time factor and the issue of making up for weak early years. So it's tricky. Then again, I fully endorse the main message behind the growth mindset - work. Theoretical talents are nothing without work, and work alone can get you pretty far.Oh, and what really annoyed me was the direct criticism aimed at many (often living) people and their choices. It was awkward, because it didn't seem like they had given an interview or anything. "

When I first came across the idea that telling kids they were smart might actually shut them down and create a fear of risk-taking, I thought it was simply profound. How could something so seemingly benign as commenting on someone's ability have such a damaging effect? How could the answer (at least in good part) to such a seemingly complex problem as underachievement be so straightforward?The truth is that nothing is ever quite that simple. However, Dweck's theory, based on extensive research, adds great insight into not just kids but adults, not just gifted but everyone--very likely yourself. Looking at this idea from many perspectives (business, sports, relationships, parenting and education) not only gave me new insight into personality but gave me a clear path to greater success.

The best part I like in this book is, workshop., in the last chapter, author gave some dilemmas and explains how the both mindset people will respond to those dilemmas. This actually made me think, how would I respond or react if I were there in those situations, which made me realise which mindset I belong to.

It's easy to spot the places in one's own life where the ""fixed"" mindset can so easily hold you back. That being said, this would have worked much better as a short, 80-page novella-type publication rather than a full-fledged book. After a while, the brief (and shallow) anecdotes of someone magically working out their entire life problems got old and repetitive. Additionally, I expected much more out of the ""how to shift your mindset"" guide than ""imagine some solutions to this problem I posed.""Worth a read? Yes, totally, but you can probably cherry-pick relevant chapters. Additionally, this book might have come off as more superficial had I not read other books relating similar things. I would suggest reading this in conjunction with ""The Power of Habit"" and ""The Practicing Mind"" for a more nuanced, in-depth exploration of this idea."

Carol Dweck discusses thoroughly the two types of mindset that people have: a fixed mindset, and a growth one. She mentions many characteristics of both and gives a lot of real-life examples of people and experiences where mindset played a huge role on how they turned out. The main goal of the book is to show that, contrary to what most people believe, talent can be learned. And even though people aren't born equally and some are born more talented than others, it's hard work and the right mindset that make the difference at the end.I highly recommend this book to everyone. It's a must-read, and will completely change the way you think about skills and talent. "

It discusses how our approach to learning, and really life, can have a radical effect when viewed through the lense of growth. Having a growth mindset means that everyone has the potential for improvement, not just the gifted. In fact, the ones whom learning or sports is a breeze are the ones who often fall down in the face of real struggle. Teaching ourselves and our youth the ""not-yet"" mentality yields a treasure trove of possibilities. To be truly successful, one must have an insatiable thirst for the act of learning and an ability to rise again when the inevitable stumble(s) occurs. Business, school, relationships, and sports are all covered with more real-world examples than might have been necessary. My thoughts around this crucial thinking for students were validated.Read as a professional development book for my school, Mindset will be discussed among colleagues who teach kids ranging from 3-18.

I'm a big fan of popular psychology books, and overall what they have to tell us is uplifting; the plasticity of the mind, the growth of the mind far past what was once thought, the ability of the mind to heal, it's connection with brain and body, etc. This book book pairs off two different kinds of mindsets, the one that says people are born they way they are going to be, and one that says people can always grow. It's not quite as simple as nature/nurture, but something along those lines. Carol Dweck gives example after example of all kinds of people and shows pretty convincingly that when you think you are just a born badass, that tends to be pretty limiting. Even if you are a badass, you have to credit your willingness to learn and hard work at least a little or you won't ever get better, and maybe people who do work harder and do keep learning will pass your ass up. Great book, recommended for everyone."

It basically depicts how people in a fixed mindset and people in a growth mindset act in various segments of their life: - relationships- family- work- passions- in rapport to themselvesI knew from long time ago the nature vs nurture opposition but I must admit I didn't look deeper into the situation. This book did not bring any new concepts to me but it did represent a lot of inspiration to ask myself twice about the reactions that I might have in certain situations and it definitely hit the spots with some real life examples described. Basically, it is a book that says you should be honest to yourself, accept your flaws, set high standards and along with that, also make a road map to getting to them. Do those things, realize that there is no ""fail"", but there is a process and momentary failure represents one or some steps on that staircase and...you'll be more than fine. Again, I totally recommend it."

How would they react differently? Would their grades improve after or would they get worse? Did you know that praising a kid as ""smart"" or ""talented"" could be detrimental to their progress?The topic is anything but dry.

The latter groups of students did well by several percentage points.

290,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/90714103-elissa-khoury,5,"Chapter 1: A very well thought out and precise introduction. Many personality traits are discussed, and of course the two mindsets. The author only speaks truth once she says that characteristics can be changed and improved, and one mistake doesn’t define you. She begins exploring a fixed mindset, in which a human is certain they cannot change and that intelligence is fixed, with no hope for change. This is then debunked with the introduction of the growth mindset, that personally I would believe I have. One bad grade, one bad day, or one bad year even doesn’t define you as a person, and personally I agree with the idea of persistence and improvement. Chapter 2:Dweck begins this chapter by discussing the difference in the mindsets romantic relationships, and how the fixed mindset prefers a perfect partner that will constantly praise them, while the growth mindset values a partner that teaches them new things and also makes mistakes, as they grow together as humans. She emphasizes on the fact that intelligence is earned by hard work, and that no one is born with it. She provides examples of important CEOS, and she proves her argument that people with a growth mindset will accomplish far more than the people with the fixed mindset.Chapter 3:This chapter is undeniably significant, and I think was the most useful chapter for me, as a student, to read. Carol begins to discuss the difference of students with different mindsets, and how that affects their grades, success and so on . Stubborn students with a fixed mindset will never improve, and students with a growth and positive mindset will only get better. Even through the transition to college, the growth mindset remained determined. She later focuses on the fact that the fixed mindset limits achievement, and that if u believe you have the ability to accomplish something you can easily do it.Chapter 4:This chapter focuses on the difference of mindsets in sports, and how the media has enforced the fixed mindset on many talented players. Physical ability is not an attribute someone is born with as we are all lead to believe, it is something that is earned by hard work and dedication, and all those with the growth mindset know this to be true. Dweck includes examples of boxing, such as the fact that Muhammad Ali, the greatest boxer of all time was not a natural. She ends the chapter by giving descriptions of success and failure, and how athletes with the growth mindset distinguished the two.Chapter 5:The author explores the “talent mindset” in business in this chapter, and how big corporations tend to hire “naturals” so to say, people with the fixed mindset. Companies that stick to the safe side and hire the same safe people that refuse to take risks, will not grow. Employees with the growth mindset strive to improve, and Carol even provides an example of a successful CEO that would hold debates to learn from others.Chapter 6: Every single human will experience heartbreak, whether it’s once or many times. This concept is examined in this chapter, and the different way the different mindsets react is too. People with the growth mindset only wanted to grow, forgive and learn from their experience, with little taste for revenge. The fixed mindset was so focused on revenge for their redemption, which personally I think is quite sad. To read about these differences only puts reality into greater perspective, as Dweck’s description of the two mindsets in love is extremely accurate.Chapter 7:The certain mindset a parent teaches their child is important, as it can effect them for the rest of their life. A parent can raise their child with a fixed mindset, and judge their every flaw as if there is no fixing it. A parent can also let their child know it’s okay to develop, learn and grow, with messages of encouragement mentioned by the author. Dweck offers the advice of not judging a child’s intelligence or ability, as people with the growth mindset know it is not fixed. Not only do parents effect a child’s mindset, but teachers do as well. Chapter 8:The final chapter of this book discusses the growth mindset, and how it can change a persons life forever. Believing you can change is the first step, and knowing that change won’t change who you are, it will only improve who you are. Mindsets frame every little aspect of us, and they are the biggest contribution to the path of our lives. We all will have setbacks, but the growth mindset will make sure we know it’s not the end of the world. This book taught me that while I may already have a growth mindset, in some aspects I don’t. Also, change is something to be sought after not feared."
291,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24812781-erick,5,"The book challenges you to interpret most if not all events in life as learning opportunities. This is called a growth mindset. Independently of the result, the key is what you can learn and/or how much you can improve from every opportunity in life. Failure does not define you as long as you can learn from it, design strategies to get better, try your best and re-assess after some time. The example by a seventh-grade girl summarizes the growth mindset well: most kids do not answer if they are not sure, but she usually raises her hand because if she does a mistake, she will be corrected and increase her intelligence. For her, making mistakes is not shameful but just part of the process for increasing her capabilities. In contrast, a fixed mindset does not allow people to become because you think that you have to already be or makes you pretend that you already are. In other words, the fixed mindset makes you worry about new challenges because we are afraid to fail or be seen as a failure. Yet, the “top is where the fixed-mindset people hunger to be, but it’s where many growth-minded people arrive as a by-product of their enthusiasm for what they do.” Thus, a growth mindset can help boosting the desire to learn or feed the passion for what you do because you are encouraged to: embrace challenges (instead of avoiding them); be persistent when there are failures or obstacles (they are part of the process and one should not give-up); see effort as the path to mastery; learn from criticism (instead of ignoring useful negative feedback); and be inspired as well as identify things you can learn from the success stories (instead of feeling threatened). People with the growth mindset tend to value what they do independently of the outcome: “They’re tackling problems, charting new courses, working on important issues. Maybe they haven’t found the cure for cancer, but the search was deeply meaningful.”It is fair to say that a reader might get the main idea of the book in the first two chapters and the rest of the chapters tend to dwell on the same point. Nevertheless, in my opinion, reading the rest of the chapters is highly recommended because the author has thought hard on making her main argument robust to several considerations/areas (psychology, sports, business, education, etc.), circumstances and/or potential critics. One of my favorites is on the importance of re-assessing and not judging because not all efforts are created equal: “For example, people with money (or rich parents) have a safety net. They can take more risks and keep going longer until they succeed. People with easy access to good education, people with a network of influential friends, people who know how to be in the right place at the right time –all stand a better chance of having their effort pay off. Rich, educated, connected effort works better.” While being aware of these factors, I suppose the message is to do the best you can with what you have. As a Bolivian, it was delightful to read the example of Jaime Escalante (Stand and Deliver) whose work allowed students with less privileged backgrounds to perform at the top of the USA national charts in math. He used a growth mindset and asked “How can I teach team?” instead of “Can I teach them?” and “How will they learn best?” instead of “Can they learn?” A final example is when the author advocates that the issue of nature or nurture is not an either or type of question and that they actually both interact. What is the use of ability if it is not ignited by effort and turn it into accomplishment?"

In today’s society, we run into situations where we have two different ways of facing problems, tasks, and everyone’s fear — failures.Carol S. Dweck wrote “Mindset : The New Psychology Of Success,” to explain how the famous “fixed” and “growth” mindsets work while also providing examples of the two mindsets as it relates to real world students, individuals, and even important CEOs in the corporate world. Based off of numerous studies, facts, and bundles of information, Dweck concludes that everyone in life, no matter what age, is capable of absorbing, digesting, and learning gobs of information like a child with the mind of a sponge. The key to this learning is being tapped into the “growth mindset” rather than the limiting “fixed mindset.”The growth mindset allows a person to grow, change, adapt, and learn, simply by using failures, mistakes, challenges, or flaws as learning tools to improve oneself or any situation. The way this works is by taking all of the information and using it to your advantage by having the willingness to work with it. Being flexible enough to take an outcome (no matter what kind) and use it to your advantage by simply, well, growing! It gives anyone the power to thrive, develop and change over time. In contrast, the fixed mindset is a very close minded way of thinking that makes it difficult to work and understand. Being in the fixed mindset is like getting stuck in the quicksand with no way out, all while having a pessimistic view on the outlook. Those with a fixed mindset are difficult to work with because they are not willing to give an inch, and believe that there is no real room for change or growth. This makes struggles and challenges seem impossible and unbearable to combat against while also giving a bitterness to others in the same circle. This book is a great read for anyone looking to break outside the shell of a closed mind and explore the world of possibility and bettering oneself. Since reading this book, I have felt a positive shift in my mind and in my life. I feel a renewed motivation for work as well as a curiosity for learning. I am learning to accept and better myself from mistakes I have made and learning to see my flaws and errors as tools to improve every single day. A huge thank you to my special friend Carlos Lopez-Lay for introducing me to this wonderful hidden gem. It has helped me in my life and I hope it will in yours! Here’s to growth and purpose! Happy reading!"
293,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19307222-shawna-p,3,"So let me preface this by saying I read...or should I say listened to, this on my own accord. It wasn't enforced on me. It wasn't on my bosses to read list. And honestly, it doesn't really fit me. Maybe I have a fixed mindset when it comes to books, because this one didn't hit a home run. I am not a teacher, coach, boss, parent, etc. I work at home by myself, and do what I need to do. I am however, a former teacher turned curriculum designer so I have heard about this book from plenty of friends. I was looking at it from more of the perspective as just a person...and that's it. Student, teacher, boss, coach, etc. None really fit me. Therefore, I do like the overall wisdom behind it all....If you believe you can, you will. This tiny notion was coupled with lots of little stories and throwing out big names. They did research in some aspects, but seemed to not dig deep behind the reasons why a person has growth mindset vs. a fixed mindset. The shortest chapter I believe was the one on how to actually change the mindset. This is easier said than done. Teachers don't know every little minute detail of their students. So Sammy gets disgruntled when he can't solve a math problem. He is deemed to be in the fixed mindset. As a teacher, we continue to encourage him and praise for his effort, not ability. Now if Sammy continues to become upset about the problem, the teacher I bet becomes upset too. Now two people are in the fixed mindset. For me, I got bored...like so bored just listening to this, and it made it hard to even finish (I skimmed the rest). I then felt guilty like I was in a fixed mindset of negative thoughts on this book. Being negative doesn't always change the outcome, nor does being positive. Life is more of a series of unending situations. Looking at things from an entirely positive side all the damn time is probably not going to make a big difference vs. having a good balance of negative/positive thoughts. Schools are still trying to foster and install this method into kids, and it's not as easy as just using different phrases when speaking. I am going to do more research, because as said, I do like the idea of it, but this book just executed it in the wrong way. "

It seems logical: if you work in a field that is all about developing people and their minds, you ought to believe in the ability to change, develop, mature, and so on. But what we say and what we do can be very, very different.I fall into this trap of hypocrisy. I believe that education is valuable to all and everyone has opportunity to benefit but many times my actions or thoughts do not support this thinking. I judge people based on their experiences and not their potential. I have caught myself determining a student’s success based on weak assumptions. I even do this to myself. Countless times I have decided that I am not gifted at certain activities such as music, art, and math with minimal effort.I think most educators would claim growth-mindset yet practice fixed mindset towards themselves and their students. In Dweck’s book, Mindset, she not only breaks down the science of mindsets but how this mentality can affect the aspects of our lives: work, relationships, parenting, and school. This book helped me shed an unbecoming light on my faulty thinking and how I can change them. Changing my mindset is a journey and not a one moment, one-day step.There are many things in my life I am passionate about and I definitely have a growth-mindset in those areas. Bouncing off these activities can help me develop my outlook on every aspect of my life.This is a great read. Another great installment in the library of positive psychology and peak performance.Growth-mindset reminds me of this great quote from the venerable Conan O’Brien:“It is our failure to become our perceived ideal that ultimately defines us and makes us unique. It's not easy, but if you accept your misfortune and handle it right your perceived failure can become a catalyst for profound re-invention.”"
295,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4645281-eduardo,4,"This book has achieved legendary status and Dweck's research that underpins the book has largely held up in the ensuing years. In many ways, this is a how-to book but, as I reflect on it more, I see it as an invitation and a challenge to constantly search for ways and opportunities to grow. This view of the book helps me feel that growth mindset is not a box that I check to say that I have succeeded in having a growth mindset but instead that the mindset itself is something that can grow and develop over time.I most enjoyed the first three chapters because I felt that they were mainly about the research into and first principles of mindsets. The ensuing chapters were less interesting to me because I felt that they read more like stereotypical books in the genre, leaning heavily on anecdotal cases where the stories can be told to consistently support the thesis. I think that it is important to notice that the subjects did not always show a growth or fixed mindset. I think it is probably better to think that there are domains in which we are better at maintaining a growth mindset than other domains. An example of this is Tiger Woods. This book was published the year prior to the revelations about his personal life yet the book would have us believe that Tiger is pillar of humanity in all facets of life, which we now know to be false.I have noticed that I feel more comfortable thinking of behaviors as ""growth mindset behaviors"" rather than ""people with a growth mindset do this"". I found myself thinking that in order to feel like I have a growth mindset, I had to always do things that ""growth mindset people"" do. One of the valuable lessons I have learned about growth mindset is that errors are acceptable and grist for the mill of improvement. Thinking of my behaviors as being characteristic of a growth or a fixed mindset helps me recognize when I have more learning to do."
296,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7045376-victor,5,"Mindset is a great book discussing something all successful people, from kids to CEOs, have in common: a growth mindset. I've read a few books talking about the importance of the way we think, Dr. Dweck did a great job tying different examples together to illustrate one of the most important paradigm shifts one can have: fixed mindset --> growth mindset. Below are my top three takeaways:1. Growth mindset vs. fixed mindset:	○ Growth mindset: ""growth mindset is based on the belief that your basic qualities are things you can cultivate through your efforts. Although people may differ in every which way — in their initial talents and aptitudes, interests, or temperaments — everyone can change and grow through application and experience.""	○ Fixed mindset: ""Believing that your qualities are carved in stone — the fixed mindset — creates an urgency to prove yourself over and over. If you have only a certain amount of intelligence, a certain personality, and a certain moral character — well, then you’d better prove that you have a healthy dose of them. It simply wouldn’t do to look or feel deficient in these most basic characteristics."" 2. It's about the journey:	○ ""Becoming is better than being."" ""Beware of success. It can knock you into a fixed mindset."" When we think about our success as a journey instead of destination, we are no longer trapped by the fear of failure or inadequate. A growth mindset would say to inadequacy, ""I'm not there yet, but I will improving myself; thank you for challenging myself so I can be better."" On the other hand, a fixed mindset would say to inadequacy, ""My identify is based on achievement; when I don't achieve/become something, I'm a failure.""	○ ""Picture your brain forming new connections as you meet the challenge and learn. Keep on going."" This reminds me of what Daniel Coyle wrote in The Talent Code, when you're in deep practice mode (struggling a bit and practicing outside your comfort zone), your brain actually starts to grow myelin, the protective coating around nerve fibers, and thus increasing the speed at which impulses are conducted and helping us to develop stronger skills. 3. The art and science of praising others:	○ ""Praising children’s intelligence harms their motivation and it harms their performance… It makes children doubt themselves as soon as anything is hard or anything goes wrong. If parents want to give their children a gift, the best thing they can do is to teach their children to love challenges, be intrigued by mistakes, enjoy effort, and keep on learning. That way, their children don’t have to be slaves of praise. They will have a lifelong way to build and repair their own confidence.""	○ This reminds me of what my dad always said to me and his friends when they tried to praise how smart I am when I was little. ""I know my son; whatever he achieved so far is a result of his hard work. Whenever he slacks off, he would not do as well."" I'd like to thank my dad for helping me to develop a growth mindset early on. Nurturing growth mindset is a continuous process - fixed mindset still show up sometimes when triggered by certain things (such as criticism or perceived disrespect), but I'm working on it. Need to be specially mindful of my mindsets in these situations."
297,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7277191-nathan-moore,3,"The author argues that there are two kind of people in this world: those with a ‘fixed’ mindset, and those that have a ‘growth’ mindset. People with a fixed mindset believe that intelligence and skill is something you are born with. You either have it, or you don't and you can't do much tot change it. Those with the FM are defensive, avoid challenges, and tend to give up easily because they must defend their perception of themselves. Those with the FM tend to resist criticism and blame others. As a result, they rarely grow and improve themselves.However, those with a growth mindset believe that their sill, knowledge, and intelligence can be changed. They are intensely curious and value work and effort over ease and comfort. They seek challenges and view setbacks and failures as valuable feedback on how to grow.Pretty helpful so far.For the rest of the book, Stanford University psychologist Carol S. Dweck, tries to apply these ideas to business, sports, parenting, and education. (She also tries to apply them to relationships, which was incredibly lame so I skipped it.) Most of her applications are simple and unnecessary, but one chapter isn't a book, its a blog post... so readers must grimace as she superficially attempts to reverse engineer this concept into well known success/failure stories respectively. Dweck is no Malcom Gladwell.There are some helpful ideas in her discussion on parenting. The most helpful thing I took away was that parents (or coaches, teachers) can cultivate the growth mindset by celebrating effort and hard work rather than talent and ability. I think this is a wise and important observation. Overall, I think her claim, though simple is sound and helpful. Be humble. Don't place your identity in your skill, strive to improve. I'd recommend reading chapters 1-3 and maybe chapter 7 where she applies her ideas to parents and coaches."
298,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30432262-jun-chen,4,"This book was given to me as a farewell gift from a very good friend. Even though the concept of growth/fixed mindset isn't new to me, this book is really a self-reinforcing mechanism, and a good reminder of how I should think/what approaches I should be using in business school.Upside: really practical. Dr Dweck gave examples applying the growth mindset, visualizing how fixed mindset is manifested in four very relatable part of life; she also broke it down to actionable steps to change and sustain the new mindset. For people who are new to the concept, I think this step is very critical. Despite being familiar with the concept, I still learned things from the Relationship chapters, and I appreciated Dweck's candor in bringing her evolving relationship with her mother into the picture. The last chapter presents an important framework that I will definitely revisit again when encountering more setbacks in life. Life definitely is difficult! Downside: the book draws on loose correlation on happenings - for example, in the chapters about sport coaching and the growth mindset manifestations, Dr Dweck seems to indicate simple correlation between the mindset and success. In addition, the book is very American centric- except for using Hong Kong University students as an example when illustrating language proficiency, the chapters about business were full of American enterprises/entrepreneurs. While there's nothing wrong with that (if anything, that will make a stronger argument), I'd appreciate if in a revised version, a more international perspective is added.It does serve its purpose for me during this journey, though, and I really do appreciate this book showing up at this point in my life. I believe strongly in growth, learning, curiosity, and humility, and this book really nicely reinforces these virtues."
299,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/830221-ashik-uzzaman,5,"My review - https://reviewsonly.blogspot.com/2020...Stanford University Psychologist Carol Dweck tells us about the power of mindset in this fascinating book. She figured that people use one of two basic mindsets in their lives - fixed mindset and growth mindset.People with fixed mindset believe the abilities are largely fixed while people with growth believe that abilities can largely be developed with effort over time. If you think your capabilities are coded genetically and you can only vary to a certain degrees no matter what you try, you are applying a fixed mindset. On the other hand if you see that it's not just your gene but your environment, your overall context and how you utilize that will determine where you will end up, you are applying a growth mindset.Do you remember the Denim aftershave ad where it says ""for men who don't have to try too hard""? This is a perfect example of fixed mindset. People with fixed mindset put themselves into an imagined box and think that is the overall boundary within which they have to operate. The think other successful people operate within a larger box or outside of the boundary than their own. Effort can only take them to the edge of the boundary and no more.However, Carol argues us to develop a growth mindset where failures are learning opportunities, challenges are not hardles but call for more efforts. She argues us not to out ourselves into a box, and keep pushing the boundaries, if any has been setup for them, with curiosity, focus, endurance, hard work. She asks. us not to praise our children for their talents but for their efforts.If you think deeply, it's a groundbreaking categorization of how we think of everything around us. I highly recommend everyone to read this book."
