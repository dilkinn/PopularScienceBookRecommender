0,0691157243,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1713956-manny,4,"Let's look at this book. What can we say about it? It's got nearly 500 pages, it's nicely produced, it's got some famous names on the cover. The blurb says it's based on a popular introductory astronomy course the authors gave at Princeton. Well, that tells us something, but it doesn't tell us what we want to know. Is it any good? So let's stop for a moment and think about how we might answer the question. It doesn't really make any sense unless we have something to compare it with. What other books are like that, introductions to astronomy written by experts and aimed at smart laypeople?So I'm going to start by taking three books that fit the general description, and I'm going to talk a bit about what they're like and how they're organized. I could pick books written recently, but I think that's a bad idea for a couple of reasons. First, there aren't a lot of books like this, and second, you don't have any perspective when you take recent stuff. I'm going to take some older books, where we know how things worked out for them from our early twenty-first century point of view. I'm going to look at those books and at the end I'm going to compare them with Welcome to the Universe.Number one. Here's Exposition du système du monde, by Pierre-Simon de Laplace. Laplace published it in 1796 and it was the most famous pop science book in France for the next century. It's worth reading even today. Next up, Arthur Berry's A Short History of Astronomy. It came out in 1898, and it was still the standard text at the beginning of World War II. And third, Fred Hoyle's Frontiers of Astronomy. It was published in 1955, and it was a major non-fiction bestseller. I read in Alan Lightman's and Roberta Brawer's very nice book Origins that it inspired a whole generation of astrophysicists.Now all these books are examples of what Welcome to the Universe is trying to give you, a good one-volume summary of modern astronomy. What do we find in them? First of all you're going to get some history. People have been doing astronomy for more than two thousand years. You've got to say something about that, both the things they got right and the things they got wrong. Because when you do science, you always get some things wrong. Later generations of scientists correct the things you got wrong. That's how you make progress. Next, you write about the things scientists have found out recently, the cutting-edge material. Some of your audience will know this stuff but most of them won't. And then you add some bullshit, because scientists are just people and they love to bullshit when they think they can get away with it.If you look at the three books I just showed you, you can see that they tried to mix up those ingredients a bit differently. Berry is quite conservative. He puts in a lot of history and you can see he's trying not to bullshit you. But sometimes you bullshit without meaning to and he does that quite a lot. He tells you people like Kant once thought that galaxies were huge collections of stars a long way off, but no one takes that seriously any more. He was wrong! 25 years later, Hubble got good pictures of nearby galaxies, and then you could see that they really were huge collections of stars. Kant was right all along. Hoyle is the opposite of Berry. He doesn't give you much history and the last third of the book is nothing but bullshit. He has his own theory, the Steady State theory, of how the universe had no beginning and has always been the same. He makes it sound very convincing. But it was completely wrong. Ten years later they found the Cosmic Background Radiation, and then everyone knew Hoyle's theory was wrong and the Big Bang theory was right. Laplace's book is remarkable. He has a very good, careful history of astronomy. He gives a terrific overview of Newtonian gravitational theory, which was then cutting-edge, state of the art research. He tells you how it was used to explain the movements of Jupiter and Saturn and the Moon, which are really complicated. They are so complicated that some people thought Newton's gravitational theory was slightly wrong, but Laplace showed it was correct and explains everything. At the end, he has a bullshit section about how the Solar System started. He says he thinks it condensed out of a rotating cloud of gas. This was way past the state of the art in 1796. He was just guessing. But he was right! His bullshit wasn't bullshit, it was prophetic. We can say that now because we know more. Very few people are as smart as Laplace was.So let's get back to Welcome to the Universe. What's the mix there? There's quite a lot of history. They don't talk much about the ancient history of astronomy, there's nothing about the old Ptolemaic system with the epicycles and the deferents which Laplace and Berry explain in detail, but they do the more recent stuff very well. They tell you how Planck found his radiation formula. They do a really good job of explaining what it means and showing you how it's completely central to modern astrophysics. The same with explaining Maxwell's field equations and Einstein's theories of special and general relativity. I really liked this part. For example, they tell you how general relativity went through several different versions as Einstein was developing it, and how he used a version that wasn't quite right when he did one of his most famous calculations, the one about the advance of the perihelion of Mercury, but luckily it made no difference. There are lots of other good things, like they give the details of how Rømer used eclipses of Jupiter's moons to estimate the speed of light back in 1676. I'll give them an 8 or even a 9 on the history.Next, the recent stuff. This is also very good. You get a bang up to date tour of the Solar System with lots of new material about Kuiper Belt objects. There's an interesting section on exoplanets. There's lots of material about galaxy formation, showing you how we now know that dark matter and black holes play an essential role. Hoyle's 1955 book had a couple of chapters about galaxies. They sound plausible, but today we can see it was all bullshit. Hoyle didn't know about dark matter and black holes. Welcome to the Universe probably gets it right, we have so much more data now. They have nice material about the LIGO gravitational wave experiment, and how it found a collision between two black holes, and what it means. That's just from last year. Like I said, this book is up to date. I'll give them an 8 or a 9 for the recent stuff too.And last, the bullshit. To be honest, I think this book has just a bit too much bullshit. I don't mean that in a bad way. Like I said, Hoyle's book has too much bullshit and it was truly inspiring. But I still think this book has too much. There's a very speculative chapter on life in the universe. There's an even more speculative chapter on time travel. They use the time travel when they talk about what possibly came before the Big Bang. Maybe they'll get lucky the way Laplace did and it will turn out that the bullshit is actually correct! But I think that's against the odds. I'm giving them a 6 on the bullshit.So all in all, I think this is a pretty good book. I'd say it's better than Berry. It's maybe even better than Hoyle. It's not as good as Laplace, but then that would be a miracle. If you're a smart young teen and you think you might want to be an astrophysicist, you should go out and get a copy. Maybe it'll inspire you."
1,0691157243,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8079403-max,4,"Tyson, Strauss and Gott team up to give us a tutorial on our universe based on an introductory course they taught at Princeton for non-science students. The authors are more than descriptive in their discussions of the stars, planets, galaxies, other objects and phenomena. Using mostly straightforward algebra they show how things such as orbit trajectories, gravitational forces, luminosity and energy levels are calculated. I appreciate their care in explaining the meaning of the various Greek letters they put into their equations. As someone who doesn’t always quickly distinguish a v from a ν (the Greek letter Nu), this was very helpful. This book is more demanding than Tyson’s and Goldsmith’s book Origins which I had read previously and covers much of the same ground. But if you want to understand, at least a little, how scientists figure these things out, this denser version is well worth it. Actually the book still has a lot to offer even if you skim over the equations.Tyson takes us from the very big to the very small. How big is a billion. He puts it into hamburgers. McDonald’s quit reporting at 99 billion, but Tyson lays out 100 billion end to end. His are four inches wide and two inches high. First put one next to the other and go around the earth 216 times, then with the leftovers stack them to the moon and back to earth again. We eat a lot of burgers. Our galaxy, the Milky Way, has 300 billion stars. The universe we can see has 100 billion galaxies and ten sextillion stars and the universe we can’t see is likely much, much bigger. Tyson does similar explanations of the very small which goes just as incredibly far in the opposite direction. To understand stars we need to understand how they generate energy. This leads to particle physics and quantum mechanics so the relevant topics in these areas are also covered. Scientists can tell what stars and gases in the universe are composed of based on their spectra. The spectra tell us what wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation are being absorbed and emitted. Different atoms have different spectra, thus we know if we are witnessing hydrogen, helium or some other atom or molecule. The distribution of elements in stars or their debris and their temperatures tell us a lot about their structure and life cycle. Thus the scientists piece together the ongoing celestial process of star generation, decay and death. But the authors don’t leave it there. They go to the structure of the atom to show why and how light waves are absorbed and emitted to create spectral signatures.Along the way the authors cover all the hot topics: black holes, the big bang, dark energy and dark matter, eternal inflation, the multiverse and the fate of the one we live in. They even try to get us to understand special and general relativity. They introduce us to string theory and ten-dimensional space-time and explore the possibilities for time travel. There is something for everyone. The book itself is very nicely done with many illustrations, charts graphs and pictures printed on good quality paper. Recommended for those who enjoy popular physics books as well as the general reader who wants a crash course in astrophysics and isn’t put off by equations."
2,0691157243,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1701553-carlos,4,"Wow, what a read, to be honest this has been the be longest it has taken me to read a nonfiction book (I started it before the date I checked in Goodreads) , also I have to recognize that this book is beyond my capabilities to properly review , all I will say is that this is not an introductory book, this is a very complex and well detailed book about everything encompassing astrophysics. If you are into the subject you will love it , but if you want to read a book about astrophysics because you are merely interested in it then you will struggle."
3,0691157243,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6100646-brian-clegg,3,"One of the first things a writer is encouraged to do is to be aware of his or her audience. I think it's interesting that this book, like many written by physicists, mostly has comments on the back from physicists, because the book is written as if they were the audience. Not as serious reading - more the equivalent of a heavy literary fiction reader indulging in a bit of Agatha Christie for light relief. The trouble is that this isn't the audience it's supposed to be for. To make things worse, each of the three authors pitches their writing differently.Neil deGrasse Tyson is his usual ebullient self, using a style that mixes the shouty with a touch of condescension. However, his content is more detailed than usual with a strong smattering of equations - enough that this sometimes feels like an introductory textbook. The opening has something of the manic 'space is really big' approach of the Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxy, but then settles down to a quick rattle through '3,000 years of astronomy.' However, to ensure it's not too interesting he also tells us that he is not going to include details of people and discoveries. To be fair, this may be because Tyson has been slated in the past for poor history of science.Despite the style, Tyson manages a reasonable balance of general observation and introduction of physical concepts. There is one odd chapter, about the demotion of Pluto from a planet which doesn't fit with the rest at all - it seems a bit of a vanity project for Tyson - but the rest fits together quite well. We've already come across Michael Strauss in this first section on 'stars, planets and life' as he interposes a few chapters amongst Tyson's, but he comes into his own in the second, shortest section, 'galaxies'. This is probably the least technical section of the book, being mostly descriptive. In a dry, but generally accessible fashion, Strauss takes us from the interstellar medium to quasars and supermassive black holes.Finally we get to Richard Gott's section, 'Einstein and the Universe'. This the heaviest section of a literally heavy book (1.35 kilograms - get the Kindle version), but in some ways the most satisfying. Gott is not a great explainer, and does perpetuate the myth that Wheeler named the black hole (a common enough misunderstanding 10 years ago, but generally done away with by now), however he gives us a brisk introduction to special and general relativity (John Gribbin would not be impressed that he refers to 'the theory of special relativity'), going on to the implications of these theories for astrophysics and even time travel. Reading Gott is hard work, but it is rewarding. However, this section feels like a completely different book - the first two parts very much fit with the subtitle, 'an astrophysical tour', but the final part is very much physics with astrophysical applications.Overall, there's a lot going on in this book, with more equations and working out than I've ever seen in a book from a mainstream publisher aimed at a popular science audience. I think it will work well for a segment of that audience - high school students who are already specialising in physics, and regular popular science physics readers who want more depth (provided they can get through the Tyson section). But the book's inconsistent approach and heavy content won't be for everyone."

6,0691157243,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17629329-leah,5,"From 2+2 to Superstring Theory and beyond...The preface explains that this book arises from a course run by the three authors at Princeton University – a course on the universe for non-science majors; indeed, for students who perhaps had never taken a science course before. My knowledge of science is pretty basic and my maths is, if anything, even dodgier. So although the idea of the book intrigued me, I feared it might be way over my head.The book is divided into three sections, each written mainly by one of the authors with the occasional contribution from one of the others. The first section is Stars, Planets and Life with Tyson as the main author and a couple of chapters from Strauss. It starts brilliantly for the beginner, with an introduction to the very simplest stuff, like how long it takes for the Earth to revolve on its axis. At this early stage, Tyson assumes no prior knowledge and lays down some terminological groundwork for the more difficult stuff to come later. For example, he explains exactly what an Astronomical Unit is and that it is abbreviated to AU. He's very funny, so that these chapters are entertaining as well as informative. Each section takes the history of scientific discovery as a template for explaining what scientists know about the universe today and how they know it. All through the book, the authors are careful to credit those who came before, even when subsequent discoveries may have proved them wrong in some aspect. They show how even disproven theories contributed to the advances made by later scientists. There are a couple of chapters in this first section that are very heavy on maths and, truthfully, lost me so badly that I wondered whether there was much point in continuing. But I decided to struggle on and happily discovered that most of the book is perfectly accessible even to those of us whose eyes glaze over at any equation more complex than 2+2=4. On the other hand, there's loads of very well explained maths in there for anyone whose mind works that way, or who wants to get a feel for whether they would like to study astrophysics at higher levels perhaps.Tyson takes us through how scientists learned to measure distances between stars, how they work out their composition and age, and goes into considerable depth on the lifecycles of stars. It's fascinating stuff and made me realise how often popular science books just tell the reader something and expect us to accept it. Not this one – every statement is backed up with detail of how we know these things and what they mean in the broader context of the universe. Throughout, the book is superbly illustrated, not just with pretty pictures (though most of them are) but with clear, beautifully designed and explained diagrams and charts that are hugely helpful in understanding the text and visualising things like size comparisons. This section finishes with a chapter on the search for planets that could support life, explaining exactly what scientists are looking for and why, and how they're going about it. Strauss takes over as the main author for the second section on Galaxies. He takes the reader through the history of how our own galaxy was first mapped and then the discoveries that led to scientists realising that the Milky Way is only a tiny part of the universe. This section has some fantastic images from the various exploratory missions like Hubble, but the really great thing is that Strauss explains in detail what we're actually seeing – how to interpret the images rather than just admiring them. He then goes on to explain the discovery that (almost) all galaxies are moving away from each other, proving that the universe is expanding and enabling scientists to estimate its age and speculate as to its future. There is a fair amount of maths again in this section, but I found it easy to ignore for the most part while still grasping the concepts Strauss describes.The final section is by Richard Gott and takes us from Einstein's relativity back to the Big Bang and beyond. I hold my hands up – it's at Einstein that my brain always closes down and I find myself overwhelmed with an urgent desire to giggle, somewhat hysterically. However, Gott actually explained the whole E = mc2 thing well enough for me to more or less grasp, plus for the first time I now kinda understand why nuclear bombs work (not sure of the usefulness of that knowledge, but you never know when it might come in handy). His explanation of black holes and spaghettification is both humorous and clear. He then takes us through all the stuff that sound more like Star Trek plots than science (to my limited mind) – cosmic strings, wormholes, time travel, superstring theory, inflation, etc. While I'll never fully grasp this stuff and retain a large degree of cynicism about a lot of it, Gott's explanations are great, and hugely enhanced by some of the best and clearest diagrams I've come across, including a spectacular six-page spread in full colour showing Gott's own map of the universe. He finishes with some speculation about the beginnings of the universe and even what may have come before the Big Bang, and shows how these (crazy-sounding) ideas arise out of the most recent science, while making very clear which bits have been confirmed by observation missions and which haven't yet. Fascinating stuff! His final plea is for Earth to look quickly at colonising Mars to increase our species' chances of longterm survival.This is a great book, managing to be both hugely informative and entertaining – undoubtedly the best and most comprehensive of its kind that I've come across. It seems to me it is indeed suitable for a beginner so long as s/he has an enquiring mind and either the ability to understand the maths or the willingness to skim over those bits that are maths-heavy. Highly recommended, but do get the hardback rather than the Kindle – it's beautifully designed and produced, and the illustrations are an essential aid to understanding the text.NB This book was provided for review by the publisher, Princeton University Press.www.fictionfanblog.wordpress.com"
7,0691157243,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26188-jafar,5,This is probably the best pop-physics book that I've read. A great summary of modern astrophysics (and physics in general) plus a lot of good history. 
8,0691157243,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3990525-crystal-starr-light,5,Bullet Review:I finally finished! WOOT! What an amazing read - even if the quantum stuff started sailing over my head. So many nostalgic memories of me going to the library and desperately looking for the one astronomy book I hadn’t read.Maybe a full review later.
9,0691157243,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1894487-matt,3,"This book is an overview of modern cosmology, with explanations of things ranging from Newtonian physics to the Big Bang to string theory and the slow death of the universe. It is basically a distillation of the ideas the authors presented in an entry-level general course at Princeton. Much of it is familiar territory, but there are also in-depth explanations that are simultaneously challenging and accessible.The ideas and concepts discussed are interesting, but the explanations are often tedious. It can be especially frustrating when the authors treat a particular chapter like a mystery novel - laying out all the evidence before explaining what they're driving at. Done well, that could be an interesting technique. In this book, there were multiple instances of extended analogies before the concept they were analyzing was presented. I found that this occasionally required re-reading passages to pick up on the nuances."
10,0691157243,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7258380-dan-graser,5,"This gorgeous introduction to several areas of physics and cosmology is perhaps the best of its kind to be published if there are even comparable works (in terms of scope, not subject matter). Richard Gott, Michael Strauss, and Neil deGrasse Tyson are all very engaging and informative writers and even though they each write their own individual chapters the book has a very even read to it, with Tyson perhaps being the most engaging of the three. You will leave this book with firmer grasp as to the landscape of the Universe and also how it and its component parts were formed, the names behind these important discoveries, and what is left to be studied/discovered. Beautifully bound with vivid and informative full-color graphs and images, this is precisely what you would want a textbook for an Introduction to the Universe class to be like. "

12,0691157243,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2616607-nikki-the-crazie-betty-v,5,"I’m always a fan of science books, and was equal part hesitant and excited when a friend of mine loaned me this book and told me I HAD to read it. Excited in hopes of discovering something new, apprehensive because I’ve read A LOT of science books over the years and when a book is called ‘Welcome to the Universe’, it leads me to believe it will be kind of a Universe 101 class. This ended up being correct. A great book for anyone who is looking into the science of our universe that has no previous understanding, but has a lot of skippable chapters for anyone that has been studying the cosmos for a bit. I ended up skimming roughly 60% of it, due to already knowing the information, but happily devoured the last 4 chapters which were all specific to quantum mechanics and string theory; my bread and pudding when it comes to science. I just love reading about it!There are definitely some big equations and numerous maths throughout the book so it can be a little heavy to someone that isn’t very number minded. I definitely recommend that if you read this book, follow along with the notes and appendices at the back of the book as you go. They offer additional insight and explanation."
13,0691157243,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27195238-menglong-youk,5,"Welcome to the Universe is one of the best astrophysics books I've read so far. Not only it includes many equations more than many other science books, but it also gives readers a thorough explanations from the history to the frontiers of astrophysics. Most of the topics are familiar to me, but the last part on anthropic principle is quite impressive. I came across the concepts of the principle before, but the scenario to which it is applied is new to me, and that's exciting.I'm looking forward to reading this book again in the near future."
14,0691157243,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5846756-helen-marquis,4,"A great book. This takes the really complex subject of astrophysics and turns into something anyone can appreciate and in a lot of cases, actually understand! The writing is superb - really engaging and takes us from a world that people once thought was flat, to the outer reaches of the cosmos! I'd say that this makes a great companion to ""A Brief History of Time"" by Stephen Hawking, as it's equally mind-bending and mind-expanding! Recommended! "

17,0691157243,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6143501-kim,4,"This book covers a wide variety of topics around the core notion of astrophysics. Tyson, Strauss, and Gott each take chapters in turn and cover everything from gravity to photons to the infinite universe to why Pluto is no longer counted as a planet. (This last duplicates information already covered in Tyson's The Pluto Files.)Unlike many popular books on science, Welcome to the Universe is brave enough to walk readers through the actual equations that helped develop our understanding of the science discussed. This includes descriptions of famous equations such as E=MC² and calculations to determine the mass of the sun. It's not all numbers, however. All three writers are excellent teachers and communicators and offer basic concepts and historical perspective on the principles they are writing about. The book also has photos and illustrations to flesh out ideas.It's a wide ranging book. Not simple and easy but a great book for anyone interested in the science of the universe and the stars inhabiting it. Some are just fun, such as the true odds of life on other planets and science geek complaints about the aliens in fiction and movies. They even touch on time travel. A great read for anyone from interested and motivated high school students to adults who wish they knew more about the subject and missed out in college."
18,0691157243,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1189982-jamie,3,"There was a lot of math to show how discoveries were made. I don't need multiple pages explaining the evolution of an equation, but would rather be told how things were related, and move on to the discussion of the idea. It probably seems childish to complain about the amount of math in a book on astrophysics, but I found it distracting and unnecessary for a book oriented toward the layperson./It was my understanding there would be no math"

21,0691157243,http://goodreads.com/user/show/100427367-teun-voost,5,"An incredible generic introduction to Astrophysics. First and foremost, I am not going to claim that I understood everything that's in this book. There's some parts of the book that involve mathematics which I cannot understand with my secondary school level of mathematics. Then again I have to applaud the authors for explaining all of the various topics they discussed in such great clarity. Astrophysics deals with all of the physics involved in the study of the cosmos... which is big, infinitely big. Needless to say then that the authors had to be extremely careful in this book which claims to be based on an 'introductory course in astrophysics'. To keep such great topics and concepts so clear and concise is quite an achievement. The fact that I think I understand most of what the authors discussed in this book is quite frankly proof that they did an amazing job. Often while reading this book I found myself wandering off to distant galaxies and witnessing amazing natural phenomena. The pictures that went along with the topics the authors discussed helped to a great extent in actually grasping the gist of a lot of difficult concepts. Perhaps the most important thing that this book has learned me, and seems to me to be the most true of all truths, is neatly captured in a quote by Buzz Lightyear from Toy Story: ""To infinity and beyond!"""
22,0691157243,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7724604-lenny-ankireddi,5,"True to the title, it is for the most part, an Astrophysical tour that takes you across solar systems, galaxies, quasars, black holes and other massive entities in the universe. However, it also deals a little bit with fundamental particles, their nature and interaction and the underlying physics that leads to the behavior of the infinitesimally small and the unimaginably large. Having read many books over the past year from Lawrence Krauss, Sean Carroll, Stephen Hawking, Max Tegmark and various other focused on similar topics, I was not so sure how much new knowledge I would gain from reading this one. I was pleasantly surprised that while it was enlightening to gather a different perspective on these topics from the likes of Neil Tyson and J. Richard Gott, this book also makes a very concerted attempt, at being more educational and trying to explain complex things in simpler ways, to those that are not as mathematically adept as it would take to unravel the mysteries of the universe.It is simultaneously humbling and invigorating to realize how much there is to know that we do not know about the universe and at the same time being able to marvel how much , we an intelligent species, have been able to divine about the the 13.8 billion years of existence as we know it in the meager few last centuries we have spent working on these problems. The book builds up from small concepts that everyone knows and understands to bigger ones that you start to get a better appreciation for to really large hairy ones that you will consign to a second reading to get a better handle of. It is also replete with profound thought on various subjects as it attempts to construct understanding of complex constructs through thought experiments and analogies.You shall not come away from a reading of this book, with a well-rounded understanding of everything there is to know about the universe. You will however gain a fair deal of understanding of how much there is to know that we do not know and how well we do know those things that we do. It establishes with more certitude through the derivation of some truths, some of those concepts that we have come to accept at their face value, by virtue of their having emanated from what we consider as greater minds than our own. It makes those constructs more relatable because we have followed the thought processes in the minds of those greats that led them to those conclusions, that we, through our own machinations, and as does so often happen with science, have inevitably arrived at ourselves. A great read for the enthusiasts and a definite second read for the dilettantes."
23,0691157243,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7701175-alison,5,"Reading this book was a bit nerve-wracking for me: my relationship with physics has been a tumultuous one over the years, involving a lot of feeling somewhat stupid. However, deGrasse Tyson's nice bite-sized Astrophysics for People in a Hurry was such an easy, interesting read that I got a burst of enthusiasm and decided to try something a bit deeper, with actual, y'know, equations and stuff. So I bought this.I was immediately too terrified to open it. See, Amazon will do you a refund if you change your mind before opening a book, but once you've opened it, I think it is all yours. And it looked so very, very long. And y'know, equations.Eventually, I did a deal with myself. Take it slow, read alongside some easy novels, tackle it only in my precious early morning reading time when I am alert and thinking. And I started. deGrasse Tyson eases you into it, chatting merrily about numbers and how to imagine them, and I slowly exhaled. This book is written by excellent educators, and it shows. Concepts are clearly introduced, Tyson teaches you to read formula as a way of expressing relationships, something I realised I had never done, always seeing them a problem-solving tool rather than the language they are. The first three-quarters of the book took me solidly deeper into astrophysics, with barely anything I felt the need to cross-check. The last quarter, when we hit relativity and the curved nature of spacetime, got a bit harder. This is partly because it is hard, and partly because while the book recovers lots of high school physics, it doesn't discuss magnetism at much depth, and these concepts come in very handy to follow the more detailed work. Gott isn't quite the educational wizz of Tyson either, and his mad enthusiasm for time travel fiction was more distracting than enlightening at times: although his use of examples was wonderful. Having said this, the book didn't lose me, it just slowed me down a bit. I also had to switch off the monochrome kindle to see the diagrams properly in colour, and found myself talking things through with the advanced-maths-degree person in the household. In the end, this was a deeply satisfying read. I feel like I have much more solid understanding of everything from the Big Bang, through to multiverses and why physicists believe in them, and what time might be, really. I would unhesitatingly recommend this, and am toying with buying it for my fifteen-year-old niece. "
24,0691157243,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27148779-claudia,5,"This was such an entertaining and interesting book, I greatly enjoyed reading it. With Neil deGrasse Tyson, J. Richard Gott and Michael A. Strauss you not only get three of today's heavyweights in astrophysics as authors, but also three people who write interestingly, with humour and great passion about their subject.The book aims to adress the interested layman, and while I would certainly call myself that and have read many books on the subject, I do have to say: it was still waaaay over my head. But I still found it extremely interesting, and what I understood made me wish to understand more. If you really want to follow everything touched on in this book, you need to be able to understand very complex higher lever maths. But it is all explained very well and in an approachable way, so that even if you can't follow the equations you can still understand the underlying principles and get a good grasp of the concepts being described.I would highly recommend this to anyone interested in ""popular science astrophysics"". However, I would NOT recommend getting this as an audiobook (like I did). Can you follow complex mathematical equations in your head? If you just said ""no"", you need to get yourself a physical copy or the e-book (personally, I couldn't even follow them if they hit me on the head, but that's another story). The book also contains a multitude of pictures, diagrams and illustrations, and while you can download these as a PDF, that won't be of use to you if (like me) you like to listen while out and about or driving. Some of the illustrations are interactive, too, encouraging the reader to follow as set of instructions while looking at them to create an optical illusion. I feel there's a lot you miss by listening to the audiobook."
25,0691157243,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20048724-suncerae,4,"Based on the introductory astronomy course co-taught by the authors, Welcome to the Universe is a one-volume summary of modern astronomy, from our solar system and beyond—including planets, stars, galaxies, and black holes.I've read a lot of popular science books, and this one stands apart. I find it's content entertaining, approachable, and scientific, extremely broad in scope, but detailed enough to keep my interest. The history of astronomy and its contributors represent a significant portion of the book, with most of the focus on recent astronomers and explanations of the equations they contributed, especially Planck, Maxwell, Newton, and Einstein.Most interesting of all is the new information that is more difficult to find in popular science books (with the exception of black holes—everyone loves those), including Kuiper belt objects,  exoplanets, dark matter, and black hole specifics, like the LIGO gravitational wave experiment. Dr. Tyson's narrative of how Pluto lost its planetary status is notably fun.Toward the end, the content moves from physical data to mathematical speculation, which is inspiring and meant to be so, but also feels more un-grounded, especially with regard to intelligent life elsewhere in the universe, time travel, and infinite multiverses.My biggest beef has nothing to do with the meat of the material at all. Most pop-science books are fine for audiobook formats, but this one references equations and diagrams constantly, and while they are provided separately for the audio version, I did not pull them up during my morning commute. Make sure you can read this one on the page and in full color!Recommended as an introductory astronomy text for anyone interested in learning some real science!readwellreviews.com"

To say I thoroughly enjoyed the book would be true. Welcome to the Universe is an entertaining, enlightening, challenging book full of fascinating information about the universe. The book is divided into three parts each tackled primarily by one of the three authors: Tyson's Part I. Stars, Planets, and Life. Strauss's Part II. Galaxies. And Gott's Part III. Einstein and the Universe. And each section is full of numerous mind bending ideas, plenty of examples, and many clarifying analogies.My problem: The book is also full of math I didn't understand. Because my math knowledge and aptitude are limited, my reading frequently ground to a halt, and just as frequently I skipped over the math out of necessity. The best laugh line in the book is not one of Tyson's corny jokes. It's Gott who, upon nearing the end of a very long mathematical analysis, precedes his conclusion with ""Of course."" To that I laughed and said, ""Of course, your analysis is correct""--not because I can confirm your math but because I don't have a clue what you are talking about. For me, it was as if the book had portions translated into a foreign language, and as a result I left the formulas behind and jumped to the next section.So with deep curiosity about the universe and a sense of humor about the book's math challenges, I completely enjoyed Welcome to the Universe (the parts I read).

27,0691157243,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52757210-noah,5,"Welcome to the Universe is a comprehensive guide into Astrophysics. It is a very well written book that is very factual, yet includes an occasional joke; making the book more enjoyable. Welcome to the Universe covers many territories that range all the way from the physics of time travel and wormholes to the interstellar medium and life on other planets. This is a book not for people looking for an easy read, as there are explanations involving physical formulae and other such things. The book includes many real life examples to help you understand the text, and definitions for the more complicated words. It also includes many diagrams that are easy to understand and at one point, helped me to understand the string theory more clearly. Over all, this is a good book that is clearly written and scientific. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys comprehensive guides and is looking to understand astrophysics more clearly."

How orbits work, life cycles of stars, the Big Bang, scale of the universe, relativity, etc. All there and covered fairly accessibly but probably quite a bit more than most everyday joes with a garden variety interest in space are looking for. It gets progressively more difficult to grasp the concepts in each chapter, and by the end I was pretty well lost, but in a way that makes me want to keep at it - you can tell there are some mind blowing epiphanies in there, if you can somehow wrap your head around it.

29,0691157243,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71193457-nathan-robillard,5,"I really enjoyed this book. Personally, I think that this book is much better than the newer one that Neil Tyson wrote. This one goes more in depth with some of the topics. This book is much more advanced and I find it to be more interesting. Every time I read a book of his I find myself learning more and more each time. This book is very good for people who enjoy astrophysics, and why the universe does the things it does."
30,0691157243,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36069918-ramon-van-dam,4,A very impressive work about astrophysics that is both broad and comprehensible. The examples given by the three authors are all very relevant and the math (which plays a huge role in several chapters) is explained clearly. Highly recommended as a companion to widely known books such as A Brief History of Time.

I learned quite a lot and have developed a renewed sense of fawning excitement about all that has been discovered and is yet to be discovered in our universe.

32,0691157243,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73812096-miguel,4,"On this review I will not only give my opinion about this book, but I'll also describe its characteristics and the difficulties I had, so you can analyse by yourself and decide if it is or it isn't a book that you would like and be comfortable to read. If you are a person that likes physics, want to understand more about the universe and have a good understanding of math, this book is for you. But if you are not good with math and seeing complex equations get you mad, than this book is not for you. There were a bunch of equation which I didn't understand having variables such as ""Newton's variables"" or variables that I've never seen in my life, they also expect you to understand how an equation works. For example: you have something divided by something else, that number will be the relation between those two things, so if you have something from the Sun and divide it by something of Earth, then the result will be the relation of Sun and Earth. My experience with this book was that I would read 3 pages in 3 minutes, but when I got on the equation part I would spent 10 minutes in one page, I'm persistent and I have patience with these kind of stuff, that's why that didn't bother me, but there were equations that I spent a long time but I still didn't get it. This book doesn't explain everything in math, the reason they put equations it's so you can understand more how it works and how the physicist did it, and if you understand you'll see that it makes sense, but they don't teach by the equations. Even thought they go step by step explaining what they did, it can be a challenge. This book doesn't teach you about physics or facts about our daily lives, this book focus more on the Universe. Overall, I really liked this book because they teach you in a fun way, giving you examples of what we have in our daily life, unfortunately this started to decrease along the way, but I'm on the middle of the book so I hope they'll still recover this. The math part can be exhausting, but It didn't make the book boring for me, and also it made me understand more things about math. I like science, and I also like math, so I think that these aspects made me like the book. The book is big, but if you like it, time will pass as if you were reading a normal size book. I hope this review helped you to understand how this book is and made you think more about it and thank you for reading my review."
33,0691157243,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15948781-rasika-mahabal,5,It has nearly 500 pages. According to its description - It is based on a popular astronomy introductory course at Princeton (i feel introductory is misleading as it is pretty complex).This is a good one-volume summary of modern astronomy. I highly recommend this book to all astrophysics enthusiasts who are not put off by equations.
34,0691157243,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5643612-ben,5,"Exceeded my expectations. Great explanations of concepts I'd read about elsewhere, plus repeated application of a strong version of the Copernican Principle, which I hadn't seen before."
35,0691157243,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6751318-naessens,4,"I loved reading this book, all three authors Michael Strauss, Richard Gott and Neil deGrasse Tyson) did an excellent job of popularizing astrophysics for the average reader. Although each of them has his own writing style, there is no difference in the quality and clarity of their explanations.The book is divided in three parts. In the first part, the authors starts at the level of the solar system. After an introductory chapter which reviews the powers of ten and the scale of the Universe, the second chapter is more an historical tour of astrophysics. Chapter 3 focuses on Newton's laws. The discussion becomes little by little more difficult, but if you pay attention you can still continue to follow the authors in their descriptions and explanations. Next come three chapters written by Neil deGrasse Tyson which are in my favourite part of the book. Getting down to the atomic level of hydrogen atoms and the energy level of electrons in order to understand and how stars burn and to how to classify them was mind-blowing. And I finally get the definition of a parsec. Two chapters with less formulas and physics conclude the first part in a more gentle way. Now I see why Pluto was disqualified as a planet.Michael Strauss goes on another scale in the second part as he takes on interstellar space, our own galaxy the Milky way, galaxies and the expansion of the Universe. I feel that gradually the explanations and formulas are less and less precise because our observations, our measures of these bigger and farther objects are insufficient, imprecise. Unproven theories and hypotheses which are yet to be confirmed replace gradually detailed technical explanation. Something bothered me in the chapter about the expansion of the Universe. Michael Strauss introduces us to the Hubble constant derived from the observing of the redshift of star radiation. So basically the speed at which two galaxies are getting away from each other depends on their distance : v = H*d. So the speed depends on their current remoteness. Michael Strauss then proposes to determine the age of our Universe as the time when the two galaxies were at the same point and uses the formula t = d/v = d/(H*d) = 1/H. But what about the time to build these two galaxies ? And what about writing the speed v(t) as the derivative of d : v(t) = d'(t) = H*d(t) which gives us the differential equation : d'-H*d = 0 ? Of course he is right and I missed a point but let's just say that I find the explanation less convincing. The last chapter of the second part is about quasars and black holes. Like the last chapter of part one, it is on the verge of science fiction at times but nonetheless interesting and one can hardly see coming the reason behind the maximal capacity of a 6-inch harddisk (expecially because it comes from black hole theories).Finally, in the third part Richard Gott deals with Einstein's theories and the latest development in astrophysics. If like me you felt the explanation were sometimes less rigorous in the second part, then brace yourself for time travels and unintuitive stuffs. I must admit that after the first chapters that introduce readers to Einstein theories I read several pages where I cannot grasp what the concepts described. Another things that bothers me is that Einstein theories sheds a new light on the observations and the measurements used in the previous chapters to draw conclusions about the way galaxies and the Universe formed, but none of this seem to have been reviewed. Anyway , as the author writes, scientists need to find a theory of everything which unifies general relativity, quantum mechanics and the strong, weak and electromagnetics forces to explain all the laws of (astro)physics. Afterwards, they will be able to discard or amend a lot of the ideas, theories formulated in the last chapters.On the whole, it was an interesting book describing a fascinating universe and not not too tricky, except for some parts, considering the complexity of the physical laws involved."
36,0691157243,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45229825-robert-stevenson,4,"Authors: Neil Tyson, Richard Cott and Michael StraussA nice overview of the history and state of the art of Astrophysics. Initially, we thought the world was flat with humans at the center. During our circumnavigation of the globe we thought we were on a planet at the center of our universe with the Sun and stars rotating around us.After Copernicus, Planck and Newton were learned we were on the third planet rotating around the Sun. But again we thought our solar system was at the center of the Milk Way Galaxy and again we thought we were at the center of the Universe. Then we learned we were to the left of the center of the Milky Way galaxy, with our solar system rotating within the Milk Way Galaxy every 250 million years and we discovered Quasars and some of the most earlist galaxies putting ours at the later stages of our Universe's creation.Thanks to Einstein and Hubble we learned about spacetime, E=mc^2, relativity, cosmic microwaves and the true age of our universe and the most probably explainations of its creation (Big Bang), placing us at the 13.8 billion mark in its Age. So humanity has been around 200,000 years and often we think of ourself as being at the center of things only to discover we are not. If we take the lessons of Copernicus seriously, as a principle, we can estimate as a species we probably have between 5000 years to 8 million years ahead of us. Most likely even less.Using all of our telescope data from the time of Copernicus and earlier and recent Hobble telescope and other inter-solar system voyages plus the Drake equation we can also predict the probably of exter terrestrial life. It is not that great, out of the 200-300 billion stars in our galaxy there are probably only 1200 or so planets within the habitual zone for creating life. And given it took us 1 billion years to evolve from simple organisms into a species that can solve algebra. It is more likely our species will end over the next 8 million years before any of the other 1200 planets can be explored. The lesson being, we are not that unique and if we haven't discovered other alien species radio transmissions so far it is unlikely any of the other alien species have evolved pass simple organisms among those 1200 planets evolution. Of course all this assumes we are only searching within our galaxy, maybe outside of our galaxy in others much older there could alien life but with the universe expanding and the challenges of traveling billions of light years it is even more improbable.However if we develop the ability to colonize planets we could extent the probabilities of the human species living longer. This is a key concept behind Eton Musk and other Astro-physicists. The longevity of our species is dependent on our colonization of Mars and other planets. After all, many of the species of Earth have become extinct already and there are only a handful that have passed the 8 million year mark.The authors do a good job of explaining how over the last 100 years humanity has gone from imaging outselves as navigators of the seas to navigators of the cosmos. I enjoyed the book far more than the Cosmos TV series as the science is weighted more than the drama. But still this book is not a true science book and outside of Gaussian 3-sphere concepts, light touching on special / general relativity, electromagnetism and hyposthesises of time travel, being that as it may, it is very readable for average individuals.My favorite take aways from the book were an understanding the history and state of the art of Astro-physics, the challenges of time travel and the challenges for humanity as a species to survive in the Universe."
37,0691157243,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10404161-alex-shrugged,4,"""Welcome to the Universe"" is an anthology of articles by various authors including Dr. Tyson. It seems like an introduction to Astrophysics for the college student, but anyone with a basic background in college math should be able to follow along. As I recall there are two calculus formulas involved but it is not critical to understand calculus to follow the basic meaning of one of the articles.I love it. This is the type of book I read when I first developed an interest in astrophysics. It allows me to follow along in the logic (which is mostly math in astrophysics) and get a feel for why these astrophysicists feel confident in the sweeping statements that they make. Make no mistake. Astrophysicists in the popular media are making sweeping statements without giving any proof. That means you are forced to trust them. Book publishers tell the authors that they lose sales for every mathematical formula that appears in a book no matter how simple. (This includes authors who publish books on economics.) Thus, about the only formula you will see in popular books on astrophysics is the Drake Equation which is more of a logic tool than a serious equation. (Not to denigrate Dr. Frank Drake. He seems like a cool guy from what little I know of him. He is part of SETI.)Dr. Tyson goes through a reasonable analysis of the Drake equation, calculating that the number of habitable planets withing 40 light years of Earth are 6 (as I recall). That seems reasonable to me. Any meaningful two-way communication with an intelligent extraterrestrial life form could take place only within 40 light years. Otherwise, you are just listening or talking to yourself without any expectation of a response. For example, the Arecibo message was sent from Earth out toward the star cluster M13 back in 1974. It will take 25,000 years for the signal to get there. However, no response is likely because in 25,000 years the M13 star cluster will have moved out of its present apparent position. So the message is essentially useless. Dr. Tyson points this out which is what a scientist should do... point out the dumb things they do, and keep moving forward. (Hey! can you tell I just watched the animated film ""Meet the Robinsons""? :-) ) Failure is not only an option, its part of the job description. That's how we keep advancing.I especially liked the last chapter on ""Our Future in the Universe"" by Dr. J. Richard Gott. (Great name. He must get ribbed about it all the time.) My favorite part was the Weak Anthropic Principle and the Copernican Principle. It was really helpful by understanding that one's place in the universe is somewhat unique, but not entirely unique. One can make some reasonable assumptions and predictions if one is reasonably objective. I suggest reading The Anthropic Cosmological Principle for a history lesson on the Weak Anthropic Principle and a proposal for the Strong Anthropic Principle. I got the most out of the first 4 chapters which is a science history lesson. It is worth reading just for that.So, I will definitely read this book again."

Astrophysics to this day resides in my same mental category for magic and mysticism: incomprehensible and potentially dangerous if I’m not careful. Welcome to the Universe: An Astrophysical Tour, by Professors Neil deGrasse Tyson, Michael A. Strauss, and J. Richard Gott, is the collaborative effort to make this subject a little more accessible to the general public, and a little safer for me.  ""It then details the life and death of stars, the Big Bang, and the curious physics of black holes."" The title of the book does not disappoint, and it indeed takes us on a grand tour of our universe. It starts with our life on Earth and recalls how mundane weather and seasonal details are actually astrophysics forces at work. It then details the life and death of stars, the Big Bang, and the curious physics of black holes. It addresses contemporary debates currently capturing mainstream society’s attention, like the possibility of alien life and the (non-)planetary status of Pluto. What are quasars, and why are they called that? How can there be a 4th dimension (or 10th dimension), and what does that imply for our universe? Is there actually a multiverse? This book talks about it all.  ""Our math equations, from E=mc^2 to the general theory of relativity, are nothing more than a summary of what we are observing."" Explanations within the realm of astrophysics invariably involve math equations. To overcome these inherent complexities, the authors also focus on astrophysics’ historical roots, when we had nothing more than our eyes to observe the sky. This is the heart of the book’s genius. Over and over again, the authors emphasize that astrophysics, like any branch of science, is in the business of making observations and making sense of these observations. Our math equations, from E=mc^2 to the general theory of relativity, are nothing more than a summary of what we are observing. Those math equations then suggest new possibilities about our universe (like dark matter), which then help point our telescopes in the direction of the next big discovery.  ""Astrophysics offers elegant answers to big questions, if only we care to look carefully at the world around and above us.""Astrophysics offers elegant answers to big questions, if only we care to look carefully at the world around and above us. It is a field where the possibilities seem endless, and the next earth-shattering revelation about our universe seems just around the corner. I look forward to these new discoveries.

Maybe it takes me a percentage of the time I took to read the book to formulate a review? It did take me over a week to read Welcome to the Universe, with Neil deGrasse Tyson's name in bigger font than the other two co-authors. At first that made me sad for the other two authors, but then I got miffed over J. Richard Gott's chapters, where there's a lot of I did this!, which probably shouldn't annoy me as much as it did, since he did figure this stuff out, but it seemed kind of braggy to me and I just want to learn abstractly about science, not be amazed that the author I'm reading now did this stuff.So I got annoyed.Cool idea I did get from Welcome to the Universe: think of everything as bread. Slice horizontally (like here in North America) for one slice of space-time, but slice on an angle (like a baguette) for a relative slice of space-time. The bread is still the same, but how one views what's happening in/on the bread changes. I'm glad I got to that before I got fed up with physics.Ooh -- and something else -- I found out what word I wanted for physics book ages ago ages ago: falsifiable. I couldn't remember that word, but much of what was written in The Universe is a Machine wasn't falsifiable, so, from a science perspective, those ideas were kind of a non-starter. But that has nothing really to do with the book I'm supposed to be reviewing ...I'm in a weird place with physics books. I probably have enough math background that if I really wanted to, I could read textbooks rather than pop-science books (albeit much more slowly, and with a pad and pencil in hand for figuring things out), but I don't want to read a physics textbook. But then I read pop-science books and get frustrated that details I want to understand (like math stuff) is missing. But I don't want to read a physics textbook. But I want to know more about what's behind the science, which is generally math that I could probably understand given enough time and pencil lead. But I don't want to write physics notes in bed. But I want to know more!Is the moral that I should stop reading about cosmology and relativity? I mean, both of those things are going to go scootering on along in life without me understanding them or not.Science is hard.Welcome to the Universe by Neil deGrasse Tyson, Michael A.

But I saw Neil deGrasse Tyson on a T.V. talk show, and I thought him quite likeable. As a youngster (a teen, I believe) he went up onto the roof of an apartment building (in New York), with a telescope under his arm. Someone called the police. (Naturally.) But Tyson was well advised by his parents, to understand that the police were armed, so he was to remain calm and reasonable if he were ever approached by them. (No attitude, defensiveness, anger.) Tyson said when he saw the police he asked them if they'd ever seen Saturn. The officers apparently enjoyed looking at the planet. I enjoyed hearing him tell this story. So, I decided to read something he wrote. I enjoy Tyson's humor, and how he makes the information as easily accessible as possible for folks like me, folks who are not science ""nerds."" Well, all three astrophysicists, Neil deGrasse Tyson, Michael A. Strauss, and J. Richard Gott, make the information digestible. But it's still astrophysics, so I didn't even try to understand the math. O.K. So, that's the equation for this, and the one for that, and so on. I don't have to understand it. I don't really want to. I'll just take their word for it. I'm not interested in time travel, so I confess I skipped through most of that. But I was in awe to read about black holes and wormholes. And the pictures of galaxies and red stars and quasars are fabulous. What beauty.It's all fascinating, but really some of this just goes over my head. I'm really more interested in the internal landscape of human beings. Can we learn what is in there so that we might create a more cooperative existence? Will understanding the cosmos contribute to that? Apparently, in some 6 billion years the sun is going to swallow the earth. Interesting. Is this what compels humans to want to go into outer space? I wonder. "

Richard Gott III is a phenomenal book about the universe. I was a fan of 'A Brief History of Time' by Stephen Hawking, and this book goes steps beyond with newer research.This book was inspired by the introductory astronomy course that the three authors taught at Princeton. The chapters are shared among the authors and cover a vast array of material. I read about the size and scale of the universe, and how things get measured. How stars radiate energy, and how we might calculate where life could be found. The story behind why Pluto is not a planet and the interesting reaction Neil deGrasse Tyson got about it is amusing. There are chapters devoted to Einstein and his special and general theories of relativity.The math is broken down pretty well, but I confess that much of it was over my head. I did better with the diagrams and pictures. You should really plan to read this in book form or a color tablet. I started reading it on my Kindle in black and white and switched over to a tablet, and I was happy I did. There are many illustrations, photographs and charts, and they are better viewed in color.In spite of feeling a bit over my head, I still enjoyed the book and it's approach to the subject. I didn't feel like it was ""dumbed down"" but I had no problem following along. The writing style feels like a lecture from a professor who is completely engaged with their subject. I highly recommend this book for anyone interested in the universe who is not daunted by a bit of a challenge.I received a review copy of this ebook from Princeton University Press and NetGalley in exchange for an honest review. Thank you for allowing me to review this ebook."
42,0691157243,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14493425-joseph-millo,5,"An obvious disclaimer - I am NOT qualified to critique the science in this book.The book is based on a very popular introductory astronomy course taught by the authors at Princeton University. My first impression was that it was VERY introductory to non-science majors. I skimmed the first three chapters (scientific notation, planetary orbits and Newton's laws) but realized that the authors were simply ensuring that the reader had a solid foundation before rapidly progressing to more cutting edge astrophysics. For me the last third of the book, written by Richard Gott, was the most challenging and rewarding. Professor Gott appears to be a proponent of string theory so I was disappointed to see that he presents M theory as if it were universally accepted by the majority of astrophysicists - which I understand from other reading is not the case. Likewise, his discussion of worm holes and time travel were unconvincing to me. On the other hand, his discussion of inflation and recent developments in cosmology was fascinating.Overall I give this book an enthusiastic 5 stars!"
43,0691157243,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31359013-fenna,5,"Took me a bit to get through this one but I'm glad I did. I should start by saying that I audio-booked this one and that it defiantly effected my experience. I would recommend buying the physical book and reading it instead of the audio book. I hated having mathematical equations read out to me and while the audio book comes with a pdf, it's not as though I'm going to pull out the pdf and look at the chart they're talking about while I'm driving to work. The first half of this book felt a bit like a review of my high school physics class- a lot of history of early physics. They start at the beginning and work up to the more complicated parts. Once I got through the review and started on the parts I had less familiarity with I started to like the book a lot more. I might even go back and re-listen to the last three chapters since I feel like I rushed through them and there's a lot of material there to think about. Overall a great learning experience but I would recommend reading the physical book to get the full experience."
44,0691157243,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42058408-annette-jordan,4,"If I had to sum up this book in one word, it would be fascinating. Despite only a very basic grounding in physics which left me a little adrift at times , overall this book serves as a great introduction to a complex topic. The authors do a good job of introducing the reader to increasingly complex ideas gradually, with lots of examples and diagrams to illustrate their points, as well as some stunning photographs of our universe. The book takes us from the basics of how stars are formed to the complex theories that could make time travel possible, at least in theory with digressions along the way to explain the demotion of Pluto and introductions to some of the brightest and most important scientific minds in history. Reading this book gave me a new appreciation for the complexity of the universe that we are part of and the ongoing struggle to understand and explain it by the greatest minds of not only our generation, but of those who have gone before us. "
45,0691157243,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18331076-alex-berg,4,"This book is split into three sections, the first on Stars, Planets, and Life by Neil DeGrasse Tyson, the second on Galaxies by Michael Strauss, and the third on Einstein, relativity, and modern theories in cosmology by J. Richard Gott. Even though I was pretty familiar with most of the material in the first section, I found it to be the most entertaining, mostly because Tyson is easily the best storyteller of the bunch. The second section by Strauss I was still entertained by, even though I mostly was familiar with the subject matter. The third section by Gott I found to be the least rewarding, even though it was the one that contained the most amount of information that was new to me. It just came across as dry and a bit disjointed at times.Overall, however, I thought it was a very good read and a good introduction for anyone looking to understand more about our universe and how we understand the things we do about astrophysics."
46,0691157243,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6891806-matt-robinson,4,"First don't get this as an audiobook. It's not bad as an audiobook, but there are far too many diagrams, equations and referenced pictures for this to flow well as an audiobook. I ended up spending about an hour with the 100 page PDF that accompanies the audible version of this after finishing the audiobook just to catch up, and that's just not as good as having things inline. Also having equations read is pretty worthless.All that said it's an awesome summary of modern astrophysics. It seems to me like an update of Brian Greene's ""Fabric of the Cosmos"", although I read that so long ago I only remember it generally. After getting past Neil deGrasse Tyson's intro topic on the unbelievable scale of the universe, this covers topics such as black holes, the shape of the universe, dark matter and energy, and more. Having multiple authors means the different chapters have different presentations styles, some going into more depth than others."
47,0691157243,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27777097-thomas-jacob-jr,4,"Phew! This one's a doozy. Destined to become a standard primer for those interested in the frontiers of contemporary astrophysics, written by some of the best in the business. The book itself is gorgeous, with plenty of full-color images of nebulae, planets, diagrams, graphs, calculations, and more. Its physical size is somewhere in the middle between a coffee-table book and a standard hardcover book, so it looks good pretty much anywhere. The content can be dense as hell, especially when equations start getting thrown around, measurements start to extend into infinity, and the true scope of the universe starts to dawn on you (hint: it's bigger than you think). While much of the information here, admittedly, went over my head -- I have a pretty weak understanding of physics and astronomy in general -- this is the kind of book that one can easily open, read a chapter, and put back on their coffee table for general perusal. Recommended for fans of the universe! "
48,0691157243,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64785453-andrei-khrapavitski,5,"The cold weather and holidays allowed some time for reading. Just before the NYE, finished an exciting book called ""Welcome to the Universe,"" which I would definitely recommend to anyone interested in astrophysics but not scared of mathematical formulas. Reading this book, I couldn't escape the thought of how fortunate the new generations are to have books like this one in addition to brilliant documentaries, including Cosmos, Human Universe and so on, which make science exciting. As a school kid, I really liked astronomy, but it was primarily thanks to science fiction and a great teacher who was able to pass on his passion. Now it is easier no matter in what circumstance you are to get excited about sciences. This, like nothing else, should make us hopeful. Neil deGrasse Tyson with his brilliant collaborators did his part very well!"
49,0691157243,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1978459-susan,1,"I am a fan of Neil deGrass Tyson, so it was disappointing that I could not read this book. It's written mostly by Tyson, with some contributions by 2 other scientists with whom Tyson taught an introductory astronomy course at Princeton. The book is based on the course and allegedly presented as an introduction for non-astro-physicists. For me it was like trying to teach astro-physics to a kindergartener......IDK, maybe a kindergartener would have understood better. I liked the stories about people like Newton, and I could understand enough to rev up a little my already established awe of the universe. But the math formulas that apparently explain everything were an indecipherable foreign language, and the more Tyson explained, the more muddled I became. I gave up. I guess (in the words of Iris Dement) ""I'll just let the mystery be."""
50,0691157243,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63229314-justin,4,"When you have a trio of some of the worlds most renowned Astrophysicists explaining in-depth the intricate perspective of the Universe as we know it, you’re not in for an “easy” read but, it is a damn fascinating one. A comprehensive guide sometimes using advanced formula and mathematical analysis as the backbone of explanation. Even though I am not adept at the mathematics presented I felt that by following the thought process that led to the conclusions made their constructs all the more solid. Most of the writing is articulated in a accessible way. I doubt I will ever be able to calculate the Cauchy Horizon using partial differential equations however, theories like these give me a better appreciation of the complexity of the universe and our struggles to define it many times leaving me in jaw-dropping ponderment."
51,0691157243,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2214993-nance,4,"Considering I've never studied physics or astronomy at all, I was worried I'd be totally out of my depth with this. Enter Neil deGrasse Tyson, who has a reputation as a world class science educator for a reason. He wrote about a third of the book, and I worried that after his portion was done, I'd be lost at sea. Enter Michael Strauss, who took the reins and proved to be a great teacher himself. I didn't realize I was kind of tired of Tyson's silly illustrations about butter guns and mixed nut cannons until I was reading Strauss. Once Richard Gott took over and I got to the stuff about Einstein, relativity, and quantum physics, I really was getting out of my league, but that was just the last 15% or so of the book. All in all, it was very engaging and informative, even to someone with a weak background in science and math."
52,0691157243,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15854961-patrick-pilz,3,"Every year or so I take another attempt at understanding Astrophysics. I guess every time I understand a little more, but will probably keep this habit up for quite some time to understand the difference between what we know, what we can have mathematical solutions for, and what are the unproven assumptions and predictions when it comes to the universe. The difference seems to be blurry, and this book does not make much of a distinction.This book has not been written solely by Neil deGrasse Tyson, lesser known physicists have joined him. At times, it is extremely hard to follow the math, which made me question ""why am I reading this?"". Anyway, I finished, I am glad I did, but now I need another year's break."
53,0691157243,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2164930-bucket,3,"I was always a good math and science student, but as an English and German major with a Master's degree in Marketing & Communications, it has been a while since I had to use those skills. I was in turns fascinated and confused by this book. Sometimes I kept re-reading until I understand the math being described, and sometimes I just moved on.In between the intense math and physics, the descriptions of what they actually mean for what we know about the universe were really exciting. I definitely got that ""we're a tiny speck in the universe"" feeling, as well as a more than a few moments of stomach-in-throat, light-headed marveling at the sheer vastness of space and bendy-ness of time."
54,0691157243,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42698612-john-h,5,"I really enjoyed this book. It made me feel like I took a course in introductory astrophysics, which makes sense because this book is made up of the contents of just such a course taught by the authors at Princeton. It covers many of the same topics as Galfard’s The Universe In Your Hand, but it is much more technical (if you are allergic to mathematical equations, this may not be the book for you). Reading this book right after that one works really well in my opinion. I feel like this one has a little bit less about the basics of quantum physics than Galfard’s, but it does cover how quantum effects apply to many phenomena in the universe. It has a lot of nice photos too."
55,0691157243,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17061542-zoe-s-human,4,"According to the preface, the book started when Gott, Strauss, and Tyson taught an undergraduate course on astrophysics for non-science majors at Princeton. Perhaps I need the high school level class. :) I was hoping to understand more of this than I did. That's okay though. I read physics books specifically to stretch my mind. I think I'd be disappointed if I followed everything. I'd feel a bit cheated.With that said, whereas I ordinarily understand around 10% of a physics book, I followed a full 30% perhaps up to 40% of this one. What I understand was brilliant, and I don't mind getting lost in such complex things."
56,0691157243,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22824517-hayley-williamson,4,"I think of the three authors, Michael Strauss' were my favorite. He had a great balance of math and explanation. Tyson's were a bit simplistic--for some reason I don't quite like his writing style, and Gott's were harder to follow without more equations, as I would have like more math (I find for quantum and cosmological ""weirdness"" it's much easier to understand as equations than explanations. But I also have an extensive physics and math background so ymmv). Overall good book though; I think this would be a good introduction to astronomy for someone who knows algebra and is willing to learn in relative detail without taking a course."
57,0691157243,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36297846-wing,4,"Base on an undergraduate course for nonscience majors, three astrophysicists demonstrate how using basic arithmetic, geometry, and logical reasoning, the nature of heavenly bodies and the structure of spacetime can be deduced and understood through observation. It is a celebration of both the majesty of the cosmos and the ingenuity of the human intellect. The text is saturated with pedagogic enthusiasm and rigour, which are augmented by some exquisite astrophotography. Some mild dumbing down is inevitable, especially in those sections that cover general relativity and its implications. Thoroughly engaging and entertaining. Four stars."

It is based on an introductory astronomy course at Princeton University, I wanted to compare it to the introductory astronomy course at The University of Sydney. I loved every chapter, every topic, so many carefully constructed analogies to avoid mathematics (though there are some formulas here and there), so many inspiring side stories, I never wanted this book to end and I am already a convert, astronomy has won my heart and mind long ago, but this book made me fall in love with it all over again!"

The authors do a great job of explication, but this still means that thus is a challenging book. I do feel that my understanding of the process behind E=mc2 for instance rose to a higher level as a result of spending quality time with these 3 intelligent and witty men."

272,0691157243,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2244665-jc,4,"This was an interesting listen and I was blown away when we got to the Einstein section. I never had anything about Einstein's theories in any of my classes and I now understand why he's considered a genius. This book does a good job of setting the baseline to get to much bigger items, but it will probably require a couple more listens to really sink in - not to mention that listening to the formulas as you get further in is just not possible to follow everything."
273,0691157243,http://goodreads.com/user/show/55965502-steve-bellinger,5,"Not exactly light reading, but fascinating. It has been years since I have been able to make sense out of such complex equations, but I quickly realized that I did not have to. The math is simply proofs of the theories as presented. I glossed over the equations that I could not follow and just took their word for it. And it worked. You don't have to be a rocket scientist to read this book, just patient,"
274,0691157243,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3858434-peter,3,"I don't have any background in astrophysics so this sounded like a good starter book. It might be, but I found a large percentage of this book to be breaking down equations and geared towards readers who already know about these kinds of things. If you do, then I'm sure this will be a good book. I enjoyed the chapters written by Neil deGrasse Tyson as he has a better way of relating information to the everyday person, but some of the other chapters were very hard to get through. "
275,0691157243,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8848209-scott-kardel,4,"If you are looking for a good, up-to-date astronomy textbook that doesn't feel too much like a textbook this is it. Neil deGrasse Tyson, Richard Gott and Michael Strauss (all experts in their fields) have put together this nice book that looks at the solar system, stars, galaxies, relativity, black holes and much more. Be forewarned, there's actual math in it, but it is used to bring added depth to the astronomical concepts explained. "
276,0691157243,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62444493-amy-foley,5,Loved this book. The three writers did a lovely job writing at a level that everyone can understand but did not make the physics too easy that it was boring. The wide range of topics covered made the book particularly interesting and informative. I love that they included a guide of additional books to read on the topics if you are interested. I would recommend this book to anyone that loves science and is interested in a deep dive into the work of astrophysics.
277,0691157243,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16362429-vance-j,4,"I really enjoyed this book, and thought it would make a great introductory astrophysics text - maybe even at the HS level (there is an accompanying workbook now, so perhaps that’s what the authors had in mind?). I thought it could do without the excursion into time travel and the multiverse towards the end, but overall I highly recommend this book and I shall consider using it in my physics class next year."
278,0691157243,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1851057-billy,4,"A fun read detailing what we know about the age, size and future of our universe (and other universes). The problem is, the math required to get a handle on all of this is somewhat daunting, at least for someone like me. I'd like to understand the many equations presented but it would take months of study. Still, it's stunning that our species has learned so much about the cosmos in a very short time."
279,0691157243,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7207399-daniel,5,"Excellent book. It's in the perfect realm between an introductory astronomy/cosmology book and a text book. Explained concepts such as Keplar's planetary laws and stellar spectra in sufficient detail, throwing in some history as well. The book lost me near the end starting with Einstein's relativity theories, but that was expected. Highly recommend. Pushed my astronomy knowledge to the next level."
280,0691157243,http://goodreads.com/user/show/217696-jim,4,"This was way more technical than I was expecting. It started out light and friendly enough but by the end I was reading how to calculate the Planck length using Newton's gravitation constant, Planck's constant and the speed of light. Or just simply calculating the Schwarzschild radius of a black hole.""Huh?"" You say?Exactly."
281,0691157243,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36613008-paul-friebus,4,"While occasionally repetitive, I found this introductory astronomy course very enjoyable. How often do you get the chance to take a class from three world-class scientists, after all? I'm pretty sure I learned more in the few hours I spent with this title than I did in an entire semester of college-level Astronomy last year."
282,0691157243,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25532224-zhe-zeng,4,"A good book for people who wanted to know and learn in depth detail of astrophysics. Basically an Astrophysics 101 course, orchestrated and composed by well known astrophysicist. Edit #1: after reading through the book second time, this book is really if you fully grasp it , the outcome : Not only you'll know astrophysics a mile wide, also a mile deep. Really worth the time spent on this book!"
