0,0385513534,http://goodreads.com/user/show/405390-kemper,3,"We’ve all been wrong on this whole rainforest issue. We don’t need to SAVE the rainforest. We need to DESTROY the rainforest. Immediately. I knew that the Amazon was a hostile environment, but I was really shocked at the variety of horrific ways that the jungle will kill a person. You’ve got your standard malaria and yellow fever. Then there’s the piranha, the electric eels, the anacondas, the coral snakes or the poisonous toads that are so toxic that one of them could kill a hundred people. Still not convinced? How about the tiny fish that will swim into any orifice and proceed to do things so terrible that sometimes men had to be castrated to survive.That’s not even talking about the bugs. Sure, the mosquitoes spread disease, but there’s also a variety of maggot that will infect living tissue. Ants that can eat your clothes in a single night. Chiggers that eat human tissue. Cyanide squirting millipedes. Parasitic worms that cause blindness. Bugs that plant larvae under the skin where it will hatch later. ‘Kissing bugs’ that bite the lips but the victim doesn’t die until 20 years later when their brain or heart swells.Even if that doesn’t kill you, you’d probably starve to death in what is described as a counterfeit paradise. Because even though there’s all kinds of plants and animals, good luck finding anything edible. Avoid the animals, the disease, the bugs, injury, and starving to death, and you’re still screwed when hostile natives catch you, eat you and use your skull as their favorite coffee mug.To hell with the Amazon. Burn or bulldoze all of it and sow the earth with salt. That treacherous hellhole has to be obliterated before it can spread. And I don’t want to hear about global warming or any nonsense about generating most of the world’s oxygen. We can breathe shallow, people!Old Percy Fawcett was a veteran explorer who mounted several expeditions into the Amazon and somehow managed to escape with his life. But he got obsessed with finding the mythical ruins of an El Dorado-type city and led his son and another poor bastard to some kind of gruesome deaths. The mystery of what happened to him led to countless deaths from other dumb asses trekking into the jungle to look for them. The guy who wrote the book knew all this and he was still stupid enough to go in there. He somehow lived through it, but I think the message is clear. Stay out!"

In 1925, Percy Harrison Fawcett, armed with information only he had unearthed, accompanied by his son, his son’s best friend and a small company of bearers and support personnel, headed off into the Amazonian wilderness in search of a large, ancient, fabled city, the City of Z. Fawcett, his son, Jack, and Jack’s friend, Raleigh, were never seen again. There were many attempts by later explorers of varying levels of expertise to find Fawcett, or at least to learn definitively of his fate. Professional writer David Grann joins that horde, armed with little or no experience as an outdoorsman and having his athletic prowess honed by years as a subway-riding resident of Brooklyn. Not, perhaps, the likeliest starting point. He sets out on a strenuous enterprise in an attempt to explain this 80 year old mystery. David GrannWhile Grann’s book is non-fiction, it reads like an H. Rider Haggard action adventure novel. You will feel palpable excitement as Grann digs up first one then another then another clue as to where Fawcett might have wound up. He follows research directions ignored or unsuspected by prior investigators, to great advantage. I won’t spoil the ending by telling what he does or does not find. That is almost beside the point. It is the journey that counts here, and part of that journey is the window Grann offers on a part of the history of exploration, the sort of people who were drawn to it, their reasons, their personalities, the effect of their quests (or obsessions, depending) on their careers, families and on the body of human knowledge. We learn also of competing theories about the potential for the Amazon to support a large, urban population. Grann shows, as well, the challenges, the horrors of trying to traverse one of the most unwelcoming areas on earth. This is a very entertaining, very informative and very engaging journey.

2,0385513534,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3427339-jeffrey-keeten,4,"”How easily the Amazon can deceive.It begins as barely a rivulet, this, the mightiest river in the world, mightier than the Nile and the Ganges, mightier than the Mississippi and all the rivers in China. Over eighteen thousand feet high in the Andes, amid snow and clouds, it emerges through a rocky seam--a trickle of crystal water.”By the time it reaches the ocean, the estuary of the Amazon river at the mouth is 202 miles wide. A trickle becomes one of the mightiest forces on the planet. 



Colonel Percy Fawcett, the legend that launched a thousand explorers.Candice Millard, in her book about Theodore Roosevelt’s trip through the Amazon, summed it up nicely: ”The rainforest was not a garden of easy abundance, but precisely the opposite. Its quiet, shaded halls of leafy opulence were not a sanctuary, but rather the greatest natural battlefield on the planet, hosting an unremitting and remorseless fight for survival that occupied every single one of its inhabitants, every minute of every day.”David Grann, the author, became fascinated with Colonel Percy Fawcett after he stumbled upon a treasure trove of his journals. He wasn’t alone. Thousands have also found his story fascinating; hundreds have been so inspired by him as to go into the Amazonian jungle in search of him, their heads dancing with visions of being the next Henry Morton Stanley to find a famous missing explorer. 

There are as many visions of what El Dorado looks like as there are explorers to look for it.On his final journey to the Amazon in 1925, Fawcett was determined to finally find El Dorado, or the City of Z as he liked to call it, but he…disappeared without a trace. Not that it is difficult to disappear in a jungle as dangerous as the Amazon. Everything from the most microscopic insect to infections to pumas are trying to kill you, not to mention the local tribesmen who may think you are interesting enough to let live or even more interesting to roast on a spit. There was one description that made me shiver: ”Espundia, an illness with even more frightening symptoms. Caused by a parasite transmitted by sand flies, it destroys the flesh around the mouth, nose, and limbs, as if the person were slowly dissolving. ‘It develops into...a mass of leprous corruption.’”So why do Amazonian explorers insist on trying to conquer such an inhospitable place? Because it is there.But also because there are people who feel an itch so intense that they have to go somewhere as far away from people as possible. ”Indeed, some might say that explorers become explorers precisely because they have a streak of unsociability and a need to remove themselves at regular intervals as far as possible from their fellow men.” I resemble that comment, but my solution is less glamorous. I’m more likely to descend into the bowels of my library and let my books take me to Istanbul, Manchu Picchu, Gettysburg, or even, yes, to places as inhospitable as the Amazon. I can navigate the river without coming down with some hideous infection or being drained dry by a vampire bat because my arm flopped outside the netting in the middle of the night or feel the sting of a poisonous arrow puncturing my neck. My martini stays dry and at the proper temperature, too. Besides the desire for discovery, Fawcett was fortunate to have an iron constitution. While other members of his party were dropping like flies from a host of illnesses or injuries, he just marched on. He lost several key years to the trenches of WW1, and when he emerged from the war to start finding funding for his final trip, he discovered that his patron, the Royal Geological Society, was broke. He had to find financing elsewhere. America beckoned.Fawcett believed in small parties rather than large, heavily armed parties for exploring the Amazon. He had a rule that I think said a lot about his character, but also about his depth of wisdom. ”Die if you must, but never kill.” Unlike other European and American explorers, he was not in love with his guns. He was there to explore and discover, not conquer.

Percy’s son Jack Fawcett looking very fit for his venture into the jungle.Decades after his final dispatch from the jungle, Fawcett’s wife and remaining family (he took his teenage son Jack with him) continued to believe that one day he would emerge from the jungle with a tale so epic that only Homer could tell it properly. Grann, too, like so many others before him, became infatuated with what became of Fawcett. He is not made in the same mold as Fawcett, or really any explorer. He is short, pudgy, and not athletic, but he is helped by some modern conveniences that Fawcett would have snickered at the prospect of using. If you so dare, strap on your machete and hack your way through the Amazon with Fawcett, and see if the jungle will eat you or make you into a legend. ”Those whom the Gods intend to destroy they first make mad!”

I am not really a reader of adventure strories but every now and again one comes along that catches my interest and when a trusted Goodread's friend recommend this I just had to give it a try and see exactly what the Lost City of Z was all about.  In 1925, British explorer Percy Fawcett and his son journey into the Amazon jungle, in search of what for centuries Europeans believed the jungle was holding secret...... "" The ancient city of Z"" an advanced civilization that many believed to have once inhabited the jungle. Unfortunately the party never returned and over the years countless perished trying to find evidence of the party and the place they called “The Lost City of Z.” In this book David Grann traces their steps.I really enjoyed this non fiction read about Percy Fawcett and his obsession and adventures in the Amazon. I particulary enjoyed how the author weaved suspense, history and geography together in this book and I was entertained as well as educated which really added to my enjoyment of the read.Its an extremely well written and entertaining book and I couldn't help but admire these exporers (and their families) who risked everything for adventure. I think readers who like non fiction and adventure and history will really enjoy this book.I listened to this one on audio and the nattation was excellent but as always with audio I cant help wondering if the hard copy had photos and maps which I would have missed out on in the audio."
4,0385513534,http://goodreads.com/user/show/279256-diane,4,"Reading this book helped clarify one of my life goals, which is TO NEVER GET STRANDED IN THE AMAZON JUNGLE.Seriously, that place would kill me. There's the threat of piranhas, electric eels, venomous snakes, vampire fish, vampire bats, disease-carrying mosquitoes, dangerous spiders, poisonous plants... and about a hundred other scary things. I fear the jungle because I respect it.* I also respect those who have set out to explore the jungle — many of whom have died or disappeared. Some of those folks are the subject of David Grann's fascinating book, The Lost City of Z. Grann himself became a bit obsessed with the Amazon, hoping to discover what happened to the British explorer Percy Fawcett, who went missing in the Amazon in 1925. Fawcett had been searching for an ancient civilization, nicknamed Z, and after he disappeared, dozens of people also went into the Amazon trying to find him and the lost city. Some never returned. This book is part travelogue, part history, part outdoor adventure. I really enjoyed reading it (even though descriptions of the jungle are terrifying) and I'm looking forward to watching the movie that is based on this book. This is the third Grann book I've read this year — I also recommend Killers of the Flower Moon and The Devil and Sherlock Holmes — and I've become such a fan of Grann's work that I'll happily read his future books. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go buy some antivenom and mosquito nets. JUST TO BE SAFE.*Note: Another great-and-terrifying book about the Amazon jungle is Candice Millard's The River of Doubt. Highly recommended.Meaningful Passage""For nearly a century, explorers have sacrificed everything, even their lives, to find the City of Z. The search for the civilization, and for the countless men who vanished while looking for it, has eclipsed the Victorian quest novels of Arthur Conan Doyle and H. Rider Haggard — both of whom, as it happens, were drawn into the real-life hunt for Z. At times, I had to remind myself that everything in this story is true: a movie star really was abducted by Indians; there were cannibals, ruins, secret maps, and spies; explorers died from starvation, disease, attacks by wild animals, and poisonous arrows; and at stake amid the adventure and death was the very understanding of the Americas before Christopher Columbus came ashore in the New World."""
5,0385513534,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1742824-jason-koivu,4,"This will make you feel like a kid again! It will ignite a Jonny Quest kind of desire for adventure, to dive into the jungle in search of lost worlds.This will also quench most desires to ever take one step closer to a jungle. ""Z"" is supposedly a long lost South American city of a once powerful people. Think El Dorado. Did it ever really exist? Finding out was the self-imposed task of an almost legend of a man who lives up to the myth:Famous British explorer Percy Harrison Fawcett...A military man with an athlete's physique and a cast iron constitution, Fawcett made the perfect explorer. As fortune would have it, he lived in a time and place where conquering the last of our Earth's unknowns was in high fashion: Victorian England.I've read a few of these sorts of books and I've come to expect the unavoidable asides. After all, to take this book as an example, there is always going to be more to the story than just one man trying to find one lost city. The Lost City of Z is fattened by many an aside discussing the myriad of Victorian era explorers who threw themselves into harm's way for glory and adventure. It was almost like a game to them, a great race to see who could get there first, be it the depths of the jungle or the arctic pole.Author David Grann juggles these stories well, never dropping the main story, at least no more than necessary to incorporate the interesting details from these off-shoot tales that help the reader to better understand the mindset of the times or to underscore the perils of such treks into the unknown.In the process of putting this book together, tracking Fawcett became Grann's adventure. However, it turned out to be one shared by many. Fawcett went on numerous South American explorations with varying degrees of success and always emerging - though slightly worse for wear - in relatively good health compared to the many who perished along the way. However, after disappearing into the jungle one last time, with his son and a friend in-tow on this occasion, Fawcett disappeared forever. In the years that followed, finding Fawcett became a new kind of sport that swept the world. Many expeditions set out to find and bring the man back, dead or alive. As you read The Lost City of Z you begin to form the opinion that ""dead"" is the only possible outcome for anyone foolish enough to set foot in the jungle. Grann's descriptions of the jungle's deprivations felt to me like watching a David Attenborough nature program in Feel-o-vision...every sting, bite and virulent disease feels like its invading your body. I itched unconsciously at every mention of the ubiquitous insects. I swore my skin creeped and I could feel a fever coming on. So, if you've got Indiana Jones aspirations, this is the cure!"
6,0385513534,http://goodreads.com/user/show/900340-nancy-oakes,5,"I picked up this book and was immediately lost between the covers and could not stop reading until I had finished the entire thing. That's how good this book is.The author sets forth the story of Colonel Percy Harrison Fawcett, a British explorer who in 1925 set out on an expedition to the Amazon to find what he had named the ""lost city of Z."" He was convinced that an ancient and ""highly cultured"" people lived in the Amazon of Brazil, untouched by modern civilization, and that they lived in a great city in a valley somewhere. He spent years doing research and gathering evidence for the existence of this place in order to get funding for expeditions into Brazil's interior. On the 1925 expedition, he took his son, Jack, and Jack's best friend, both eager to be part of a mission that would make history. But shortly after they had arrived into the Amazon area, all communications ceased, and while their movements were traced to a point, nothing concrete was ever heard regarding the three explorers. Their disappearance, and the publicity following the mission from which they never returned, prompted years worth of explorers trying to locate any trace of Fawcett, his son, and his son's friend, even as late as 1996. Too bad for those left behind, Fawcett, who was facing a lot of competition from others exploring the Amazon at the time, and worried that these other explorers might find the lost city of Z before he would, kept his route a very closely guarded secret, so it was pretty much impossible for anyone to go in to either locate bodies, effect a rescue or even trace with any accuracy the steps taken by Fawcett and his group. Although Fawcett's wife refused to believe that her husband and son were gone, they had pretty much just vanished off the face of the earth. Grann, who writes for the New Yorker, decided to try to find Fawcett's route and discover what had happened to him once and for all. This book not only traces Grann's efforts, but takes the reader back into the Victorian period, at the peak of the British Empire, to look at exactly who Percy Fawcett was. It also examines old and modern views of the indigenous peoples of the Amazon as well as offers a glimpse of the fate of the rain forest in modern times.Simply stunning and superb, I loved this book so much that I pre-ordered a copy for when it is released for the general reading public. The writing is excellent, the mystery surrounding Fawcett's disappearance is well portrayed, and the amount of effort that Grann went to in his research is very much apparent here. If you are looking for something entirely different that will mesmerize you instantly, you cannot miss this book. I had never heard about any of this up until now, & my curiosity has been sparked enough that I made notes and took down book titles to fill in some holes in my knowledge. I cannot recommend this book highly enough, and I would like to thank Doubleday for sending me this book and also those on Shelf Awareness for offering it as an ARC. It is an excellent piece of writing. "
7,0385513534,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6105365-michael-ferro,5,"After reading KILLERS OF THE FLOWER MOON, I was desperate for more nonfiction and, especially, more David Grann. Well, THE LOST CITY OF Z did not disappoint! The joy of Grann's writing isn't just in the sense of action and adventure he offers in his works, but the incredible reportage and detail he puts into each of his books. Fawcett, a man larger than life and one who might seemingly be impossible to capture in the antiquated medium of the written word, comes alive like few other historic characters I have come across. His adventures into the Amazon in the early 20th century had my inner explorer feeling jealous and envious—that is until I came across the vivid descriptions of the horrors that awaited all explorers to this remote section of the world...During Fawcett's time, the Amazon was truly the last uncharted area on the map of the world (and in some ways, this is still the case in our present day). Once thought of as an impenetrable and harsh world of greenery and things that will kill you, certain brave souls went searching for lost worlds and hidden treasures. And while Fawcett was certainly no gold hunter, his mounting obsession with the lost city of ""Z"" had me truly wondering just what could be out in that dense and surprisingly delicate land of life. As with all of Grann's works, it is the mystery of the unknown that lurks at the heart of the story: what is possible, what is out there, and can we reach it? Grann attempts to answer all of these questions in his book and does so in such a way that it becomes one of the most thrilling and exciting nonfiction books I've read recently. I highly recommend this book for fans of ""Indiana Jones,"" early 20th century history stories, and just those tired of sitting on their lounger at home and wondering whether or not they should drop everything and run off into the jungle. (Hint: PROBABLY NOT A GOOD IDEA TO RUN OFF INTO THE JUNGLE.) "
8,0385513534,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2389048-denise,2,"Incredible reviews, national best seller, interesting subject matter, well written, extensively researched and yet it did nothing for me. EPIC FAIL. Not sure why but I had a hard time getting through it without falling asleep every other page. Too many details, too many names, too many stories, too much repetition (I get it, the AMAZON is incredibly dangerous). The first half just dragged and dragged. I am glad that I made myself finish it otherwise I would have nothing positive to say. I will admit after trudging through the back story, the intensity took off and my interest was held until the end. Unfortunately, more than half the book had been begrudgingly read by then. To illustrate: first half took two and a half weeks, last half took two days. Might not have been my thing but I can totally see why others would find it compelling and I did learn some things that I would otherwise not know. Apparently, there is a PBS special on Fawcett and this last expedition and I wouldn't mind watching it based on reading this book so evidently it wasn't a total loss. Hate to be sexist but it seems that men enjoyed this book more than women. As for me, I must be too practical and without an adventuresome bone in my body because I kept screaming ""Stop going in to that godforsaken jungle, people!""."
9,0385513534,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3815302-libby,4,"4+ stars - This is the third book I’ve read by David Grann. I enjoy his journalistic and research-oriented writing style. He knows how to weave a yarn and draw the reader in; I was captivated by this story of one man’s obsession with finding the lost city of Z. Colonel Percy Harrison Fawcett is an intrepid explorer who mapped areas of South America previously unknown to Europeans. Only Indian tribes lived there, some very hostile and with good reason. Many had been enslaved by the Spanish conquistadores; many others had been murdered. According to Grann’s research, Fawcett was impressive physically and seemed to never tire. During his South American ventures, Fawcett heard tales of El Dorado, an ancient civilization in the Amazon, where “The Great Lord...goes about continually covered in gold dust, as fine as ground salt.” According to legend, there were also groves of cinnamon trees in the kingdom, a spice that was highly valued at the time. The Incan empire had at one time consisted of nearly two million square kilometers and was peopled by more than ten million. Discoveries like this fueled Fawcett’s obsession of finding El Dorado, which he called Z.Grann delves into Fawcett’s past, his marriage to Nina, a very cultured daughter of a magistrate in Ceylon, his exploits in South America, his service as a Lt. Colonel during World War I, and his dealing with spiritualists, including the controversial Madame Blavatsky. What I enjoyed most about Grann’s account is that he reveals his protagonist’s flaws along with his idolized characteristics. Some of the bad include his surly nature after spending time with his family, his preference for his son Jack over his other two children, and his tendency to intimidate men he considered physically inferior or not up to his standards. On these long treks into the Amazon, even the slightest injury could prove fatal. Fawcett would prefer to abandon men rather than lose time taking them to a neighboring village to be cared for. Fawcett’s almost infallible constitution, his courage, the dignity and respect he almost always shows the Indian tribes are just a few of his most highly idolized attributes.In April 1925, Fawcett entered the Amazon accompanied by his twenty-one-year-old son, Jack, and Jack’s best friend, Raleigh Rimell. Jack, as fit and muscular as Fawcett, seemed to his father the ideal explorer’s companion. Raleigh, whose father had been a surgeon in the Royal Navy, was also a muscular young man, known to have a joyful and clownish nature. As their journey is well underway, Raleigh suffers from an infected foot and becomes despondent and gloomy. Fawcett begins to worry that Raleigh will keep him from his goals. He takes him aside, encouraging him to return with the guides. I want to whisper in Raleigh’s ear, “Go!,” to shout in his dreams, “Leave!” Raleigh has written to his brother, “Two’s company--Three’s none.” Jack is like his father, turned on and energetic with the adventure. Raleigh has no desire for glory or fame and longs for “a small business and to settle down with a family.” While writing this book, Grann pursues his own journey into the heart of the Amazon. I would have been disappointed had he not mentioned the Amazon’s current state, it’s decimation, the difference between Fawcett’s time and now. Grann writes, “I kept looking out the window, expecting to see the first signs of a fearsome jungle. Instead, the terrain looked like Nebraska--perpetual plains that faded into the horizon. When I asked Taukane where the forest was, he said, simply, “Gone.” A moment later, he pointed to a fleet of diesel-belching trucks heading in the opposite direction, carrying sixty-foot logs.”What destiny does Fawcett meet in the jungle? I was impressed by Grann’s research and his attention to detail. As well, he is thorough. I felt like I was getting a full picture of Fawcett, the man, and explorer, as well as insight into early twentieth-century events. The ending felt a little contrived but suits Grann’s particular storytelling method. Above journalistic and research-oriented, Grann is above all, a grand storyteller."
10,0385513534,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3920693-richard-derus,4,"Rating: 4.5* of fiveThis review has been revised and can now be found at Expendable Mudge Muses Aloud.Real-life Indiana Jones doesn't come back from this one. 2017 Movie News: Go watch the trailer for this Amazon Studios film. I'll wait. Okay, now go read the Rotten Tomatoes aggregation. Won't take long.Now. A four-plus star book review from me and a host of other sources, agreement among critics from Den of Geek all the way to The Nation, and a cast of pretty, pretty actors...plus the fact that it's an Amazon Studios original appearing hot on the heels of their Golden Globe-winning Manchester by the Sea, makes this a super-promising April 2017 must-see. Amazon might very well be Satan, I can't say I agree but there's a chorus of unhappy people from contractors to suppliers to anti-globalization zealots who say it is, but Satan's offering us a lot of really great inducements to forget his agenda. Amazon's Prime streaming service alone is worth the $100 a year it costs. I love that so much of Amazon Studios' output is book-based. Calculated or not, it's a great thing to see the filmed entertainment industry gain a player that mines the immense vein of unadapted written work instead of churning out sequels and comic book heroes and the occasional bland screensaver-level movie.But...having Prime-watched it...it is a disappointing film, and I was so hoping for something outstanding. It's gorgeous. It's utterly gorgeous. It's a Prime freebie and deserves watching for the cinematography. The WWI bits are pornily lovely, in love with their violence but curiously unmoving like porn. But the damned film isn't anything like as effective as the book! I am not, as you who read my reviews regularly are aware, a knee-jerk book's better boy. In this case, goddammit, the book's better at getting you in the feelz. PS Charlie Hunnam is gorgeous but wrong for this role. He does a creditable job with some slim writing but isn't pulling Percy out of his pockets. Robert Pattinson is outstanding as his second-in-command. I don't care about Sienna Miller anyway, and Nina is forgettable."
11,0385513534,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1923002-mara,3,"You can see how someone, perhaps someone who goes by the alias of Kemper, would read this book and come to the conclusion that we need to destroy the rainforest immediately (see review and comments that follow for a glimpse at the behaviors of peoples who have never before come into contact with sarcasm). Seriously though, as noted in my review of Candice Millard's The River of Doubt: Theodore Roosevelt's Darkest Journey, and further evidenced in reading this tale, the jungle is a punishing, dangerous place. As per usual, I'll refer to Sterling Archer for wisdom (see River of Doubt review), ""Everything out here either wants to eat me or give me malaria!""*The hunt for the 
City of Z
 follows the footsteps of professional explorer and part-time crazy person, Percy Fawcett (below, in an image which also suggests he may have been a Sherlock Holmes cosplay enthusiast), who went down jungle-yonder in search of the real-world, lost civilization equivalent of El Dorado.

Fawcett would probably be appalled by any comparisons with Roosevelt, but they did both take their sons into the unforgiving tropical environs and raise the hackles of the culturally-competent Marechal Cândido Mariano da Silva Rondon (below yucking it up with an indigenous peoples).

Big difference between Fawcett and TR? Fawcett never came back. Seen below with fellow explorer and guide Raleigh Rimell shortly before the expedition vanished, Fawcett's story, in the hands of David Grann was equal parts River of Doubt and 
Skyjack: The Hunt for D.B. Cooper
 as tales unravel of the many minds and/or lives lost in attempts to solve the mystery of a missing man.

So what's Grann's take on all this jungle business? Well, pretty darn similar to Millard's who he, in fact, quotes in her description of the deathcage smackdown that is Amazonia:

The rainforest was not a garden of easy abundance, but precisely the opposite. Its quiet, shaded halls of leafy opulence were not a sanctuary, but rather the greatest natural battlefield anywhere on the planet, hosting an unremitting and remorseless fight for survival that occupied every single one of its inhabitants, every minute of every day.

Why such hysteria? Well you've got your classics- poisonous snakes, jaguars, and crocodiles (""aka the world's most deadliest predators""- Archer's words, not Grann's). There's also a boatload of clever camouflage going down, para exaple (Portuguese) a caterpillar that makes itself look like a viper.

If you manage to avoid getting a fish lodged in your orifices, you still have disease to contend with. In addition to quotidien little things like Malaria, there's espundia.
""an illness...caused by a parasite transmitted by sand flies, it destroys the flesh around the mouth, nose, and limbs, as if the person were slowly dissolving.""
Obviously there are pictures of what that little gem of an illness can do on the internet, but even I have my limits. Oh, and also the reaction to white men waltzing into a camp of natives isn't always predictable.A fascinating, fun read that probably would have been a bit more riveting if I hadn't read The River of Doubt quite so recently. Three and a half stars!Bonus Archer Jungle Zing:

""What? I don't think it's racist to assume that a previously uncontacted tribe of indigenous peoples might react unpredictably, perhaps even wildly, to a bunch of white guys who walk up and hand them a goddamn M16!""

13,0385513534,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7986781-heidi-the-reader,4,"A well-researched tale by journalist David Grann about Percy Fawcett, the intrepid explorer who disappeared in the Amazon jungle on his search for the city he called 'Z'.The part in this book that I appreciated the most was Fawcett's struggle to learn about and appreciate the cultures of the people he discovered in the Amazon, while at the same time, juggling his own biases against any culture other than his own.In some ways, he was a product of his time, but the fact that Fawcett at least tried to understand different cultures made him different than other explorers of his age.It's only a small part in a larger tale full of adventure, exploration and discovery.The tid-bits about the jungle, mentioned by other reviewers on Goodreads, I first learned about in The River of Doubt by Candice Millard. https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7...The narrative in River of Doubt was more focused than this novel, but Millard was talking about one trip, not multiple trips or explorers.There's a lot of weird stuff that goes on in the jungle. Read either of these books to find out all about it.Recommended for fans of non-fiction. If you're looking for a more straight-forward adventure tale than this wandering title, choose River of Doubt."

I can't say I appreciated the man as I got to know more about him as the book progressed.So all in all an interesting 3.25 starred read, there was no closure to the mystery after-all...."

At times it felt like I was slogging through text right alongside the jungle trekkers. However, the ending was satisfactory enough to make me want to give the movie a chance. There is something inherently romantic about the idea of lost cities and pilgrimages. Don't we all feel that tug deep in our psyche? That perpetual urge to find/experience/accomplish/see/do/have the next unattainable thing, to catch the carrot that's always dangling just out of reach? “Civilization has a relatively precarious hold upon us and there is an undoubted attraction in a life of absolute freedom once it has been tasted. The ‘call o’ the wild’ is in the blood of many of us and finds its safety valve in adventure.” Although I'm eternally grateful to be alive now, this era of adventure and exploration must have been an exciting time to be alive."

17,0385513534,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1826682-trish,4,"What a great read. For really the first time I understood the fascination with the phrase 'armchair traveller.' In other circumstances, I always thought it was somewhat absurd to think that reading about a thing was as fun as doing it. In this case, it was a lot more fun to read about it than to do it. Pit vipers, swarms of biting insects, interminable wet, death by maggots...and in all of it, a frustrating mystery. At its heart, this is a story of the search for a magnificent civilization in the heart of the Amazon, with vast earthworks paralleled only by great cities on the European continent. This is a book to make you think about what man is: his determination, his understanding, his folly, his ego, and how some of us have these things in greater measure than others. "

It gave a real sense of what the conditions would have been like for Fawcett. "
19,0385513534,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22699228-matthew-quann,3,"A question for my nonfiction-loving friends: what is it you love about nonfiction?I ask this question not because I have an inherent dislike for the factual, more that I find fiction much more compelling, readable, and entertaining. It’s why I’ve switched to taking in the bulk of my nonfiction through audio: I just find it easier to get through in that medium. Still, I like to take the occasional foray into reading my nonfiction. With The Lost City of Z, then, I’m confused as to what I make of the whole experience.On one hand, the story is wild in every sense of the word. Grann chose well in his subject as Fawcett’s obsession over a hidden city in the Amazon is compulsively readable. Unfortunately, I found I was taken out of the story by the endless exposition. Hey, I get it. This is a superbly researched and probably hella accurate book, but I’m not pulled in by tidbits unveiling whose journal documented Fawcett’s journey, I just want to read about the journey. Despite the fact that this book caused me to struggle with my relationship to nonfiction, I was rather taken with the concept. In fact, I think if I had listened to this book rather than read it, I’d be all over it. Grann brings the exploratory culture of the early 1900s to life through tales of warm weather, mysterious jungle, and some truly gnarly infectious diseases. Fawcett’s slow circle of the drain towards toxic obsession is also really interesting. We get to see the man take dangerous and almost superhuman treks into the wilderness with an almost blatant disregard for those who come with him. My favourite sections were those in which Grann tells his parallel tale of discovering Fawcett and developing his own obsessions about the explorer’s unknown fate. It was these passages that kept me turning the pages between brief tedium. Throughout the whole book, Grann maintains an objective style that is to the point and well-organized.So, overall, I’m a little bummed out about this one. I had really been looking forward to reading it, but I found it slow and it took me way longer to read than I had anticipated. I’ll be checking out more of Grann’s work through Audible though, since I am impressed with his thorough research even if I wasn’t always entertained by it."
20,0385513534,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38617426-juli,5,"Percy Fawcett, a famous British explorer in the 20th century, disappeared into the Amazon jungle with his son and his son's best friend in 1925. Fawcett was searching for an ancient lost city that he called Z. The 3 men were never seen again. Over the decades after their disappearance, several teams and even individuals ventured into the dense jungle to find the famed explorer. Some of them reappeared weeks or months later sick and emaciated, and some were never seen again. No real trace of Fawcett was ever found. Plenty of rumors and lies......but no bodies or real evidence as to their fate. Fawcett's wife was never the same again. Flash forward to modern times, and New Yorker writer David Grann also goes to the Amazon jungle in search of evidence of Fawcett's fate. I love history and tales of the old style explorers....the men who trekked off into the unknown just because it was unknown. Not the sort of people who explored to make money, or to gain renown. But real explorers....the ones who mapped the world, discovered indigenous peoples and didn't plot to murder them all or evangelize them, the ones who climbed, trekked and discovered new places just because they were there. Fawcett was one of these men. Unfortunately, as with many explorers, his belief in himself, his obsession with his quest and his feelings of invincibility eventually caught up with him -- and he took two young men with him. He escaped fate multiple times.....but it catches up with everyone eventually. In 1925, he walked into the jungle in a valiant attempt to search for the Lost City of Z that he knew to his soul was there, and disappeared forever into the mysteries and tall tales that grow from such stories. Just a head's up for readers -- this is not a fictionalized story. This is a non-fiction account of the history of exploration in the Amazon jungle, the story of Fawcett's life and treks around the world, the fate of other explorers of the time, facts about his son and friend that went along on the 1925 trip, and the aftermath of the disappearance. There is also an accounting of David Grann's trip to the Amazon to glean facts about the fate of Fawcett, the local indigenous peoples and how the area has changed since the 1920s. Readers who don't like historical accounts of facts and information might want to pass this book by. But, for those who enjoy history....this story is awesome!! I loved this book! Anyone who enjoyed Douglas Preston's recent book, The Lost City of the Monkey God, will also enjoy this book. I listened to the audiobook version of this book. Read by Mark Deakins, the audio is just over 10 hours long. Deakins reads at a nice pace with an even, pleasant tone. I have hearing loss but was easily able to understand this entire book. It is obvious that Grann did a lot of detailed research into Amazon exploration, Fawcett and many other treks around the world at the time. He gives details of Fawcett's journals and news stories from the time, and information gleaned from Amazon natives and others. Such an interesting and intriguing story!!Because the book includes information gleaned from writings, journals and other sources from the time, there are some racist overtones in portions of this story. Many scientists, explorers, politicians, journalists -- hell, even the general white populus -- viewed indigenous peoples (or people of color in general) as lesser human beings, stating that there is no possible way they ever created a large society because it would be impossible for them to do so. At times as I listened, I found myself making snarky remarks to these long-dead idiots. Some of those old views were what started horrible and asinine beliefs/movements like eugenics, or cultural destruction by evangelization. Oh, we are white and must go to these countries and whitesplain to the natives that they are inferior, and must mold to our moral ideals or perish. Blah, blah, blah. What a load of racist crap. My take on the entire matter is this: how could anyone believe themselves superior to people who can survive and thrive in the most hazardous and inhospitable parts of the world when the whites who ventured there died in droves?? But as they were venturing into the jungle and dying of disease, starvation, accidents, predation, and native attacks, they wholeheartedly believed themselves freaking superior because of the color of their skin and their fat, sheltered lives in the modern world. Really?? Seems to me the people that can survive and feed themselves in that place are the superior ones. Amazon has released an original movie based on this book. I wanted to watch it, but had to follow my rule of always reading the book first. Now that I've read the book, I can enjoy the film! :) I hope it keeps the integrity of Grann's research and doesn't fall into over-grandizing fiction, rather than the interesting true facts of the case. David Grann is the author of several books including The Devil & Sherlock Holmes: Tales of Murder, Madness & Obsession. I'm definitely going to be reading more of his books!"
21,0385513534,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1531553-sara,4,"The Lost City of Z by David Grann is exceptional book that I can altogether recommend to every variety of reader. This well-rendered and deeply researched biography of Percy Fawcett, centers on his all consuming obsession with the Lost City of Z (evidence of a great but forgotten jungle civilization), the international fever that follows his mysterious disappearance and some of the more exciting tidbits of Grann’s journey to piece together Fawcett’s tale.  The book is unrelenting in its portrayal of everything Fawcett—you will find yourself deep in the Amazonian Jungle from the first page and racing through the subsequent pages to a surprising conclusion. It boasts unbelievably TRUE stories of savages, cannibalism, kidnappings, murder, torture, mutiny, starvation, massive hoaxes, madness and exotic deaths. Not only is this a astonishing biography, it’s also a fantastic adventure story. "
22,0385513534,http://goodreads.com/user/show/897874-bruce,2,"Two stars is probably generous. The rating stems from having known but little about the Amazon rainforest from an experiential point of view. Had I even taken more than a few trips to the National Zoo's only-slightly-muggy version largely without free-roaming pestilence, my rating would probably have been lower. So expectations and foreknowledge are everything here. The more you already know about what a godforsaken wasteland the Amazon is (from a nontropical, industrialized, rocking-chair, artisanal beer-swilling perspective), the weaker I imagine this book will appear.On that note, perhaps you're interested in reading about the exciting new disoveries that analysis of satellite imagery and carbon dating combined with sympathetic boots on the ground are lending to the field of pre-Columbian anthropology in the Americas. This is not that book. That book, referenced here only at page 284, is apparently  Charles Mann's 1491 and one which I look forward to reading at some point.Perhaps your interests are less expansive, limited to  Michael Heckenberger's work with and in proximity to the Kuikuro and Kalapalo tribes in the Amazonian Xingu region, presumably near to Colonel Percy Harrison Fawcett’s last-known whereabouts in his quest for the burg whose romantic name The Lost City of Z serves as the title of this book. You know, a book documenting a theory that represents a paradigm shift away from the 20th century view of Amazonia as a “counterfeit paradise” incapable of sustaining population density sufficient to yield a complex culture. Well, this is not that book, either. That book, referenced here a mere four pages from the end of his narrative at page 273, is Heckenberger’s own work called  The Ecology of Power and has been described by archaeologists and geographers (as related by David Grann) as “extraordinary,” “monumental,” “transformative,” and “earth-shattering,” which sounds worthy of at least a browse.Perhaps..., perhaps really you’re a fan of quirky travel, adventure, and outdoorsy exotica of the type to be found in  Douglas Adams’ amusing  Last Chance to See or  Jon Krakauer’s harrowing exposes of human folly and hubris  Into the Wild or  Into Thin Air and hoping to find here a biography of intrepid Edwardian explorer Fawcett that will match  Adam Hochschild’s telling of Lord Stanley’s disturbing exploits in the Belgian Congo in  King Leopold’s Ghost. Alas, none of those terrific books are this one, either.In fact, it’s hard to say what this book is, as David Grann doesn’t seem himself to know. Here’s how he opens the book: Preface – the author is lost and alone deep in the Amazon in pursuit of his story (this is actually not the case, but does self-destructively set the stage for the frustrating futility which the reader will perceive throughout the book). Chapter 1 - introducing Fawsett onboard ship destined for Brazil and what will become his last documented trip into the rainforest in 1925. Chapter 2 – introducing James and James, Jr. Lynch, wealthy bankers who managed to survive their own “In Search of…” quest into the Green Hell in 1995 only by ransoming themselves to a hostile kidnapping tribe (give ‘em a hand, folks, as they will be returning only once later in this story in a cameo role). Now here comes Chapter 3, melodramatically surtitled, “The Search Begins” (for what? the dimly-charted border between Bolivia and Brazil? Ninety-year old undocumented human remains which in the best of conditions would surely have vanished within the first decade of disappearance? the fact that water is wet, heat hot, and indigenous cultures mercilessly exploited and victimized? quel surprise!) and we’re back with the author in first person again as he documents what will ultimately prove to be only his own pointless, journalistic narcissism. Thus bumblingly shifting through multiple points of view, Grann exhausts readers’ patience and sympathy for the characters intended to be their surrogates. As no one even arrives at the jungle until nearly 80 pages in, this book even fails as a member of the nature-as-monster genre.You do pick up some interesting facts about life in the Amazon (via the author’s ultimate encounters with Heckenberger) and a bit of Edwardian-era explorer gossip (via mildew-spotted correspondence with the Royal Geographic Society circa 1911), but nothing worth a book-length investment. I read this in anticipation of a book talk and am now dying to find out why this particular work was chosen. I’m hoping Heckenberger will turn out to be the speaker. If it’s Grann, I won’t waste my lunch hour."
23,0385513534,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4086118-michael,4,"Excellent engaging read of a quest of a quest. Grann, a non-athletic journalist in New York, becomes obsessed with the obsession of an early 20th century British explorer, James Fawcett, with the uncharted areas of the Amazon near the boundaries of Bolivia and Brazil. His fame for several expeditions between 1905 and 1915 skyrocketed to nearly Airhart proportions when he disappeared with his son and his friend on a 1925 journey into the vast Mato Grosso wilderness of Brazil in search the ruins of an ancient civilization Fawcett codes as the ""Lost City of Z."" Rumors of a lost civilization and clues to its general location was what was driving him, not unlike the quest since the time of the Conquistadors for a gold rich El Dorado. Grann deftly charts the origins of Fawcett's character from his Victorian family upbringing, the worship of antecedent explorers like Burton, and an early experience looking for ruins in Ceylon while in the colonial army. His charisma and competence were sufficient to garner the backing of the Royal Geological Society and later the U.S. counterpart. On the ugly side, he had little empathy for anyone in his party who could not keep up with his pace, and he neglected his family. Paradoxically, Fawcett respected the many Indian tribes enough to avoid violent encounters at all costs, yet believed along with nearly all Europeans in their genetic inferiority. Fawcett came to believe that Amazon dwellers achieved a high civilization before the arrival and destructive impact of colonialism and European disease (e.g. Machu Picchu found in 1911). However, he bought into the idea that such civilization had been spread by ancient Phoenicians. Grann's research among Fawcett's letters and descendents led him to pursue his own foray to Brazil to uncover the mysteries of his disappearance and the potential real foundation for the lost city. In this, he was following along in the footsteps of numerous expeditions from the first in 1928 to the last one in 1996, all of which ended in failure and led to perhaps 100 deaths. It is hard to consider that there can be a spoiler to a journalistic memoir, but there is a surprise bit of archaeology at the end. Grann had to know about it, but he kept it tucked away to enhance the drama. I didn't appreciate this bit of showmanship in what otherwise passed as an objective account."
24,0385513534,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21413858-k-j-charles,0,"The tale of Colonel Percy Fawcett--what a name--an Edwardian explorer of the most fantastically Rider Haggard kind. Derring do, apparent natural malaria resistance, absurd physical courage and endurance, mad as a spoon, obsessed with the Amazon. He mapped the borders between various South American countries, but became obsessed with finding El Dorado and the fabled Lost City of Z. No, really.At the time received wisdom was that the indigenous tribes of the Amazon basin were inferior, weak, savage, blah blah Victorian racism. Fawcett was a man of his time in many bad ways but achieved a kind of doublethink morality that let him treat the locals as human (using radical tactics like 'not shooting them on sight' and 'learning their language' and 'grasping that enslavement and genocide had rather put the survivors off Europeans') and he became convinced that great ancient civilisations had existed in this insanely hostile dangerous 'green hell', as Europeans called it while flocking there for adventure or profit and dying in swathes. I had no idea how horrendously dangerous the Amazon was. Anacondas and maggots and diseases that make your face rot off. Argh. This is the interwoven tale of Fawcett's increasingly obsessed search for a great ancient city in the jungle and his eventual mysterious disappearance, which was a worldwide sensation, and the author's pursuit of evidence about his fate. Generally these sorts of stories can be rather unsatisfying--let's face it, he and his party died and something ate them and we'll never know more--but this one manages an ending that I found magnificent (probably because I was coming from a position of total ignorance of the entire topic but hey). A really enjoyable, engaging read of a vanished civilisation, by which I mean crazed Edwardian explorers obviously. "
25,0385513534,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5159766-l-a-starks,5,"Another superb book from David Grann. I read this after reading his later Killers of the Flower Moon.Grann researches, and then replicates, Amazon explorers' efforts to find the El Dorado (or ""Z"") of the Amazon. As in KFM, he focuses on the story of one individual, Colonel Percy Harrison Fawcett, and his extensive efforts.We take satellite pictures and maps of the world for granted, but Grann shows so much of the world remained unmapped until the 1900s, and that the Royal Geographic Society supported scientific efforts to do so.A stellar and exciting nonfiction read with a great twist ending."
26,0385513534,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5745485-christopher,4,"Don't you think the magic is gone from this world? There's nothing left to explore or discover. And if I were to pack a backpack and trek off into the Amazon rain forest in search of a city made of gold and possibly the fountain of youth, you'd institutionalize me.But not Percy (F'ing) Fawcett, the guy whose mustache and zeal for adventure more than makes up for his sissy first name. He's the real-life Indiana Jones. A treasure hunter, not an archaeologist (and by the way, it's clear to me now that Indiana Jones was truly the worst—absolute worst—archaeologist ever). The type of man who waltzes into the jungle and doesn't care if he ever comes out. A hairy-chested, fire-spitting, lion-wrestling, not-scared-of-big-spiders man!But now I'm realizing something...I'm expecting a child now. And the manly men I admire, the adventure-loving ones, they all seem to die. They wander off into the wilderness and die alone. This guy, Percy Fawcett; it's still a mystery what happened to him. Joshua Slocum, author of the wonderful Sailing Alone Around the World, disappeared while he was sailing alone around the Atlantic Ocean. Christopher McCandless, subject of Into the Wild, died alone in a school bus in frozen Alaska.Maybe... just maybe... I'm just a man who reads about manly men. Maybe I'm not, after all, the type of manly man with a waxed mustache and stylish but functional dungarees and an unquenchable thirst for danger and adventure, alone and with diminishing hope of survival. I think I'm the type of manly man who will enjoy the small adventures of hikes in the park (jungle) with my child; bike rides around the block (in hot pursuit of stolen jewels); climbing our backyard elm tree (Mount Everest).Maybe the world still has some magic left in it, after all."
27,0385513534,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6316460-becky,4,"The jungle is super scary ya'll. I havent had this many gross out moments since i read ""The Illustrated History of Cannibalism."" So there is no way you will get to the end of this book without being wildly impressed at the abilities of PJ Fawcett and what he was able to do and when he did it. No radios, violent (rightfully so, btw) Indians, no modern medicine, and yet he helped mapped thousands of miles never mapped before in the middle of a jungle.Likewise you will be equally disgusted to learn about the Rubber Barons and the absolute historically-disregarded genocide of the Amazon's indigenous people. I am really appreciative to Grann for being honest about the limitations of Fawcett, his attempts to break out of his cultural racism, but also how he couldnt quite move away from that limitation, and also for writing about the horrors both of the rubberwars and then WWI.The part I actually liked the most acme right at the end when he discussed the modern archaeology of the Amazon and how its blowing established minds on the subject. For so long it was thought that it was a desert of civilization because the jungle is just too inhospitable, but now we are finding that there was a vast, powerful, and beautiful culture that lived there and spread outwards. Absolutely fascinating. I would have definitely liked if Grann had included more information about the struggles of archaeology in the region, but felt that he did what he could without getting too off topic since his book IS about Fawcett.Overall a good read that I would definitely recommend."
28,0385513534,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1500718-ryan,5,"The most dangerous moment in my highly amateurish hiking career was when I fell a little behind my friends and then fell off a mountain path. Fortunately, I was holding a rope and did not roll down the cliff into the rocks below. Unfortunately, my friends couldn't hear me screaming for help. I held on tight, calmed myself, and climbed back on to the path.It scared the living daylights out of my mom when I told her, even though I was clearly still alive as I told the story.So you can bet that my mom would not have wanted to know Percy Harrison Fawcett, an English explorer tasked with exploring the Amazon rain forest at the start of the 20th century. Not easy. Any creature not poisonous is probably trying to reproduce in your skin. Fawcett referred to the jungle as hell, but he couldn't stop himself from exploring it repeatedly, relentlessly, and obsessively. By the 1920s, Fawcett became convinced that a lost city had been buried within the forest. He set out in 1921 and again in 1925 to find it, only to disappear in the attempt.What a story!Which is exactly why David Grann sets out to tell Fawcett's tale of obsession in The Lost City of Z.To his credit, Grann has a great eye for details, describing the horrors of the jungle, the arrogance with which the Royal Geographical Society viewed the Amazonian Indians, and the preparations needed to plan an expedition. I also enjoyed his discussion of spiritualism in an age that ostensibly celebrated reason and science. Grann's favorite example, and mine, was Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, who was enthusiastic about exploration, invented Sherlock Holmes, and believed wholehearted in psychic mediums. More than anything else, Grann has a great sense of pacing and of narrative. In fact, The Lost City of Z may be the most exciting work of non-fiction that I have ever read.However, perhaps Grann's dedication to the story gets the best of him.For one thing, Grann enters the jungle, which he passes off as obsession (nicely done), but by the end of the book I found myself wondering if it wasn't just a marketing gimmick. This is perhaps unfair, so please let me explain.Ostensibly, Grann enters the jungle to trace Fawcett's route and to find his remains, if possible (about 80 years later). He has also made contact with Michael Heckenberger, an anthropologist studying the Amazon. Grann implies that their meeting is a surprise. And he further confesses his shock that *surprise* there is evidence of a lost civilization after all. Quite frankly, it seems unlikely to me that Grann wouldn't have known of Heckenberger's findings before heading into the jungle. Surely amongst all this obsession he looked up Heckenberger's work before heading to Brazil.But it does make for a good story to suddenly discover, just as Grann is about to return to New York, that there is evidence of an ancient civilization after all.So although I am suspicious of Grann the reporter, I certainly recommend Grann the story teller."

For those of ye who are new to me log, a word: though this log’s focus is on sci-fi, fantasy, and young adult, this Captain does have broader reading tastes. Occasionally, I will share some novels that I enjoyed that are off the charts (a non sci-fi, fantasy, or young adult novel), as it were. So today I bring ye:the lost city of z: a tale of deadly obsession in the amazon (David Grann)This pirate Captain has a slight obsession with exploration, treasure, and secrets. I recently read a fascinating non-fiction book about a stowaway to Antarctica. Then I saw this book about the Amazon which features missing people, a lost city, treasure, exploration, and death. Arrr! A must-read or in this case must-listen.Now first off all let me just say that I will keep me sharks, kraken, and man-eating white whales. The sea has nothing on the Amazon. The Amazon has so many types of disgusting flesh eating bugs, flesh eating diseases, and flesh eating fish. Ye thought piranhas were bad. Try candiru. Ugh. Sailing that river does not appeal.What did appeal was the lengths and struggles that man would go to find and conquer nature. Or attempt to conquer it. This novel mostly chronicles the adventures of Percival “Percy” Harrison Fawcett. Percy was a “British geographer, artillery officer, cartographer, archaeologist and explorer of South America.” He became obsessed with finding a lost city in the jungles of Amazon. Some called it El Dorado. He called it Z. Finding the city would consume him and eventually lead to his disappearance in the jungles of Brazil in 1925. What happened to hardened and experienced Percy on that last ill-fated expedition? Author David Grann was determined to solve the centuries old case.Like the book about Antarctic explorers, this tale was full of details about the lengths to which these men would go to protect “their” finds and their fame. It also showcases how much effort went into planning and funding an expedition. I found the details of the flora, fauna, and geography of the Amazon to be fascinating. The author even portrays his own trip into the jungle in the name of research.Really the novel is dense with detail and history. It was riveting and seemingly well researched. The only downside I had was the ending which mentioned some interesting new archeology finds in the area of the Kalapalous tribe that may change the entire historical landscape of South America. These findings by Michael Heckenberger were only touched on. I wanted more!Side note: While researching for this post, I found a rather scathing article by John Hemming on how the author’s book was immensely exaggerated and factually incorrect. "
30,0385513534,http://goodreads.com/user/show/869064-jeremy,3,"This is kind of an odd accomplishment: an adventure book that will make you really really glad your not an adventurer. Grann's descriptions of Fawcett et al trampling through the amazonian rainforest with their crass, (often racist) imperialist delusions of grandeur and discovery are often gut-wrenching. Skin peels off in sheets, everyone gets malaria, parasites, maggot infections (shudder), gangrene, etc. Trekking through unspoiled tropical jungles is utterly horrifying, you basically just turn yourself into an oozing, walking meal and wait for the rainforest to literally devour you. Grann remains fairly non-judgmental through out. After all, it's the green hell of the jungle itself which finally breaks down and destroys hubris and good intentions alike. Seriously, some of this stuff would make Werner Herzog blush."
31,0385513534,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3195534-melanie,3,"3*. Well that was interesting! For most of the book I thought Percy Fawcett (the explorer whom the book is about) was probably a complete wack-a-doodle. At the end of the book, maybe only partially a wack-a-doodle but you do have to be somewhat obsessed to keep going back into that environment looking for a fabled ""Lost City"". I cannot fathom trekking into the Amazon jungle in our times with modern technology let alone in the 1920's when Fawcett did it. It is not a place I would ever desire to experience, just on the bug issue alone! Gross stuff in there!! The book is a bit long in places but overall pretty good.(Why is GR marking everything as read twice when it's only been read once?). Maddening!"

The author also has a new non-fiction book to be published in April, 2017: Killers of the Flower Moon. My original review:: ""This is a very readable, well researched book. It focuses on explorer Colonel Percy Fawcett, and his obsession to find a great. ancient city deep in the Amazon jungle which he called Z. Z ,if it existed, may have given rise to the legend of El Dorado. The book tells the story of Fawcett's quests, and of the author attempting to journey to the Amazon to try to solve some of the mystery around Fawcett's mysterious disappearance on his 1925 expedition.  Anyone interested in early 20th century exploration and past and present day Amazonia should enjoy this book. Prior to his ill-fated journey, Fawcett had explored the Amazon several times before. He was an arrogant man, rarely getting along with those who accompanied him on his journeys. He seemed immune to most tropical illnesses and scorned those who became ill or couldn't keep up to his break-neck pace, regarding them as weak. His obsession to find Z bordered on madness as he consulted spiritualists. The author found that his papers showed ever increasing bizarre beliefs. For his last journey he advertised for strong men to accompany him (no women allowed). A large number of scientists, explorers, athletes and people wanting adventure or just wishing to get just away from home replied. Among those turned down was Lawrence of Arabia . Fawcett felt that a person used to the desert would never keep up to him in the jungle. Instead he decided to go accompanied by his 21 year old son and the son's best friend.  As Fawcett was very secretive, not wanting any rival explorer to find Z before he did, his exact route was unknown or sometimes written in code. The disappearance of Fawcett and the two young men caused a sensation, and countless people also vanished or died searching for them.It also tells the stories of other explorers in the early part half of the 1800's. These adventurers have now been replaced by archaeologists and anthropologists. Grann discovers in his journey a ruins which may have led to the legend of Z which is now being studied and excavated, and he believes he knows the fate of Fawcett and the two young men from stories passed on by several Indian tribes."""
34,0385513534,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6969151-veeral,4,"That obnoxious Amazon. It likes to monopolize and dominate the jungle. Although one might be led to believe that there would be an abundance of everything where such a mighty force exists, the truth is exactly the opposite. As David Grann puts it himself: It’s the great “counterfeit paradise”. I couldn’t agree more. Amazon will starve you. Amazon will desiccate you. And finally, Amazon will obliterate you. Because, simply put, Amazon doesn’t care for you. It’s a green desert. Unfit for human civilization.Take the example of Colonel Percy Harrison Fawcett. He wanted to make “the great discovery of the century” by finding the cryptic lost City of Z but instead, the uncaring Amazon rainforest consumed him, his son (Jack) and his son’s friend (Raleigh Rimell). So, “the great discovery of the century” became infamous as what has often been described as “the greatest exploration mystery of the twentieth century”— that is, the mystery of the fate of Percy Fawcett and the whereabouts of the lost City of Z.Many have tried to solve the mystery over the years, but failed.No one could find exactly what happened to Fawcett and certainly no one could find any clues that Z ever existed. But why should it exist? It was really pointless of us to assume right from the start that a civilization could prosper under something as brutal and vainglorious as Amazon. Sure, Grann did made some flimsy attempts by the end of the book by hinting that a civilized colony might have existed in the Amazon in the past, but that didn’t half-convince me.So, one thing I would definitely take away from this book is the fact that, Amazon is the bane of civilization."
35,0385513534,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5858699-kavita,4,"David Grann is a journalist, who got fascinated with the legend of Percy Fawcett, the Amazon explorer who disappeared into the Amazon in 1925, along with his son and his son's friend. Fawcett's obsession with an ancient and highly complex civilisation within the Amazon rainforest forms the basis of this book. Grann sets out to prove that Fawcett was right, and makes a journey into the Amazon himself.The Lost City of Z is basically a biography of Fawcett and concentrates on his quest for the legendary city that he called Z. I originally assumed that it was Grann's own journey into the Amazon which would be described here. There were short chapters in which he got ready to enter the forest, and since the story was not about it, it all turned out to be superficial. It would have been much better if Grann had concentrated solely on the Fawcett story.Interestingly, Grann quotes from the writings of Spanish conquistadors who had travelled the Amazon in the 1500s. Their descriptions varied from those of Fawcett, because by then, the local tribes had been wiped out massively and the region deforested. Grann's own journey showed yet more deforestation and extinction of life since the 1900s. Sadly, a few hundred years down the line, we might not have an Amazon rainforest left despite its vastness, so these accounts are valuable. The real appeal of the book, of course, lies in the fact that you can enjoy the deadly rainforest from the comfort of your couch. Not for us the risking of our lives and confronting snakes, mosquitoes, and other creatures of the rainforest, not to mention battling disease, hunger, and thirst. For us, the delight of expertly sliding into a beautiful world you can romanticise without really having to move a muscle. The Inferno Verde can become a Paraíso Verde."
36,0385513534,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39134508-kathleen,4,"This book was chosen by my book club as the non-fiction book for the month. I am hoping that it will qualify for a Bingo square - name of a city in the title ""Lost City of Z"". David Grann is a reporter and states at the beginning of the book that he isn't the type to get involved in the stories he works on and researches. Once he finishes a story he moves on to the next one. But like other adventurers, David did get caught up in the ""greatest exploration mystery of the twentieth century"" and set out to solve the story about the disappearance of British explorer Perry Faucett, and his son in the Amazon. What happened to them while they were searching for the Lost City of Z? This is a very informative and interesting non-fiction book that reads much like an Indiana Jones adventure story. David Grann expertly weaves geography, history and science together resulting in a breath-taking narrative. I listened to the audiobook of this story narrated by the talented Mark Deakins. He is one of my favourite narrators because he uses different voices for each character, and the voices seem to fit the character -bringing the story ""alive"". (I have read over 160 audio books and feel this audiobook enhanced my experience reading this book. If you are new to audio books, I think you should opt for reading this in print.)I highly recommend this non-fiction book for readers interested in history, explorations, and the Amazon."

38,0385513534,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2370826-dave-cullen,5,"Brilliant. This is a new classic of the narrative nonfiction genre.The prose is vivid and intoxicating, and he weaves together 2+ threads, seamlessly--with the Fawcett thread dominant, as it should be, yet given fresh life with the mingling of the contemporary thread.I was drawn in from the start, but oddly enough, I REALLY got fascinated when he got to the developing field of cultural anthropology, and the fights over whether the people in the Amazon were ""noble savages"" or just ""savages,"" or stupid subhumans, or . . . and what the apparent tiny population really meant. Throughout the book, there was an adventure story going on, but a much wider, deeper consideration of how the discoveries there fundamentally altered our conceptions of how and why we all are the way we are. And it crept into those ideas artfully, interestingly and never pedantically. It never bogged down into a university course: felt more like an exciting speaker spurring our curiosity and helping us run with it.So well done. I'll use this as one of my models for all my future books.(And as a writer, I can't resist saying: Great verbs! I mean, stupendously great, every page, every paragraph. Never too much, consistently just right.)"

40,0385513534,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1377720-deborah-edwards,5,"Do you remember the first time you saw ""Raiders of the Lost Ark?"" Because I do. In fact, I remember clearly that I didn't want to see it. The name sounded silly, and I had no clue what it was about. Visions of pirates and space creatures clouded my judgment. Luckily, my friends dragged me in by majority vote and I emerged from the theater two hours later, exhilarated, endlessly curious about early human cultures, and determined to live a more exciting life. And it stuck. Years later, I stood in the middle of Albuquerque receiving my degree in Anthropology, still consumed with a passion for learning about ancient human history and lost worlds. Percy Fawcett, the adventurer, explorer, and land surveyor at the heart of ""The Lost City of Z"" would have most likely seen a lot of himself in Indiana Jones. If ever there were a real-life version of the intrepid anthropologist, Fawcett would definitely be a frontrunner. And fate seemed to lead him there. In his early military years in Ceylon, Fawcett heard the legend of a lost city buried beneath an earthen mound near his base. He took it upon himself to try to locate this lost world, and appears to have had some success, although he did not have the wherewithal at the time to excavate it. Still, the thrill of the find and the desire to pursue other ""lost worlds"" grabbed hold of him then, and planted the seed of obsession that would follow him throughout the rest of his life. Working for the Royal Geographical Society, Fawcett was sent to the largely uncharted and dangerous forests of the Amazon. By many accounts, there seems to be no crueler environment in the world. When I was once contemplating graduate field work, I recalled the stories of an anthropologist who had visited our class to tell us about his work with the Yanamami, a tribe so fascinating and remote that many classmates later expressed their desire to do the same. But me? Not in the least. I knew the last place on earth I ever wanted to live - even for a short time - was within the bug-infested, snake-laden, vampire-bat heavy jaguar lair that is the Amazon. Mosquitoes love me here in New England. Imagine the feast I would provide them in the rain forest. I would be nearly bloodless in a week. But Fawcett, he was made for the place. Surveying the formerly unexplored (by white men) border between Brazil and Bolivia, he accomplished his mission nearly a year ahead of schedule. This despite losing half his team to disease, the arrows of hostile tribes, parasitic worms, viral infections, and starvation. By all accounts, Fawcett was impervious to disease, boasting a hardy constitution unphased by the rigors of a jungle so dense that a day's worth of hacking through it with machetes sometimes only gained the team a half a mile of advancement. His amazing physical stamina and seeming disdain for the suffering of others bred one of two things in the men who served him: intense loyalty or mutinous desire. The tales of both of these conditions in his many journeys back into the jungle after his acclaimed first mission, are the stuff of legend. But, somewhere along the way, Fawcett began to hear about a Lost City, much like the famed El Dorado, a city of vast palaces and towering pillars, filled with riches and covered in gold dust. Having encountered a smaller version of this phenomenon in Ceylon, Fawcett became intrigued. As time went on, intrigue turned to obsession, as more and more of the oral histories he encountered in the tribes he befriended, as well as the geographical and archaeological record that had newly been discovered began to substantiate the claims. When Hiram Bingham discovered Machu Picchu during the same time period as Fawcett's work, it only fueled his desire to find his own ""lost world."" ""The Lost City of Z"" is brilliantly told and exhaustively researched by David Grann. Needless to say, Fawcett's final mission involved a last ditch effort to find the city, taking only his grown son, his son's best friend and a couple of temporary native guides. They went into the forest in 1925 and were never heard from again. Since that time, literally hundreds of amateur explorers have trekked into the same hostile jungles to try to find the missing Colonel and his companions. As recently as 1995, a Bolivian businessman and his grown son (along with an expert team and the best technological aids) tried to finally find out what happened to the Fawcett team all those years ago, only to find themselves taken captive by an Amazonian tribe. (The tribe debated whether or not to kill them for three days until finally releasing them in exchange for their thirty thousand dollars worth of equipment.) And this was 1995 - not 1925. It is no wonder that Grann himself finally feels compelled to witness the land where Percy Fawcett was lost forever. His journey, which he documents late in the book, is far more eventful than I would have imagined, and his final meeting with the anthropologist Michael Hecklenberger, who has lived in the Amazon for over a dozen years now, was insightful and educational. For anyone who has ever felt the pull of exploration, imagined the thrill of a lost world, or even just really enjoyed the exploits of Indiana Jones, pick up this fascinating book. I doubt it will make you want to trek through the Amazon, (in fact, it may dissuade you from going to a jungle anywhere, ever, under any circumstances), but it might just make you want to explore a new culture, visit a museum, or even just take the long way home. And if it does, Percy Fawcett may have succeeded in some small way."
41,0385513534,http://goodreads.com/user/show/798978-barbara,5,"The story of ""Colonel"" Fawcett, and his explorations of the Amazon were once world known. Fawcett was searching for a legendary city in the jungle. He began his explorations in the 19th century. In the Victorian Age exploration was done by amateurs, and the field of anthropology was in its infancy. Fawcett's trips were financed by the Royal Geographic Society in London. Fawcett was relentless, driving his family into bankruptcy. On his final trip in 1925, he and his son, and a third man, disappeared.The descriptions of the explorations were hair raising. The insects were not only pests but dangerous. I won't go into detail but their effect on humans are disgusting. There was also danger from some the the warlike tribes, who as recently as the 1990's killed outsiders who wandered into their territory.The author Grann decides to investigate Fawcett and the ""lost city"". This book is mostly a report of Fawcett's life, and expeditions. He was famous not only for his numerous journeys, but his ability to form friendships with Amazon Indians, and his appreciation of their way of life. Grann himself travels to Brazil over a 100 years after Fawcett disappeared. This is a fascinating account, and one I found hard to put down."
42,0385513534,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1605591-christine,5,"	Shortly after I finished this book, the BBC World Service reported that a Brazilian man who advocated for small farmers, natives, and the rain forest was murdered. He was shot five times in the head while biking with his wife. The same report made reference to the 2005 killing of an American nun, a murder that Grann mentions in his book. What the news report drove home was the idea that the Amazon is still a dangerous place, just not exactly in the same way it was during Fawcett’s time. Instead of worrying about how a misunderstanding with a native tribe could end in the death of tribal members or of the group of explorers, the battle is now between business and various types of conversation. In many ways, a more violent battle, not just because everyone has guns.	This idea is not wholly examined in The Lost City of Z, though David Grann does touch on it in the closing chapters of his book, and the idea of the destruction of the natural world does run though a good portion of the book.	Much of the book is about Fawcett and his various trips to the Amazon; culminating in what was undoubtedly a fatal trip to find a “lost” city that he had named Z.	In fact, if you are going to learn anything from this book (and you are), the most important is the simple fact that if the natives tell you not to do something or go somewhere, LISTEN TO THEM! THEY KNOW FROM WHENCE THEY SPEAK!	(I’m using the slightly political incorrect term of natives because I am a good American who has been taught that Indian refers to a person from India. South American Native Americans is way too wordy, there too many tribes to list all the tribe names, and the term Native American or First People [nations:] would make me sound like the news anchor on CNN who referred to the African immigrants protesting/rioting in Paris a few years back as African-Americans.)	Fawcett was a man who spent more time in the Amazon then with his family. As an aside, Grann does a wonderful job of showing the strength of character of both Nina Fawcett and Grann’s own wife, making both women sound just as, if not more, heroic than their husbands. In fact, Mr. Grann, your wife sounds far more intelligent than you. (Sorry, don’t mean to offend, but she knew you needed more than sneakers before heading into the Amazon). The men who explored the Amazon seemed to have married very understand and supportive women (and, if possible, very rich women). While her husband was dealing with nasty bugs and a fish that could swim up his wee-wee, Nina Fawcett was giving birth to their second child, raising their first (eventually raising all three children), keeping house, and protecting her husband’s reputation, all of this on a rather limited budget.	To be far, Fawcett seemed to know that he was unworthy of her. This is what makes the book charming. It’s warts and all, and the people who have warts, know they have them. It’s very human.	Fawcett became convinced that there was lost civilization in the Amazon, basically a version of the city of gold myth. It was during an attempt to find this city that Fawcett, his eldest son Jack, and his son’s closest friend disappeared in the Amazon. The disappearance set off searches, rescue missions, and theories (such as this book), possibly resulting in another 100 deaths/disappearances.	Grann seems aware of his obsession and the risks it brings to both himself and his family. In fact, it seems like this is going to be his only big adventure. It seems he learned a lesson that Fawcett didn’t or couldn’t learn.	In some ways, the most interesting part of the book is the closing chapter which describes what a lost civilization in the Amazon is truly. Think the Incas, the Mayans, the Aztecs but in a different country. If the rain forest is turned wholly over to big business, if its defenders and supporters are murdered then not only do the flora and fauna of the Amazon disappear, not only do tribal cultures (if not whole tribes) die, but the Lost City of Z will still forever be lost."

While not really giving any sort of definitive answer to what happened to Percy Fawcett on his last expedition, the book was a wonderfully researched book on turn of the century amateur exploration and the competition that ensued between these gentleman rivals.While the final discovery was a great vindication of those explorers who felt that there had to be some sort of great civilization in the Amazon region, we are still not sure that Z has been or ever will be found.Nonetheless, this is one journey that I was happy to make with the author and am amazed at the treasure trove of new information he was able to provide everyone."

The story of real-life adventurer Fawcett was interesting in itself, of course, but maybe not quite five stars. HOWEVER, I was pleasantly surprised that the book also gave me a sense of early 20th popular culture. I walked away with a new perspective on the environment that produced stories like The Lost World and At the Mountains of Madness. Also, I have scratched the deep amazon off my list of places to go hiking."

46,0385513534,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35799-amy,4,"Colonel Percy Harrison Fawcett was quite a famous explorer in his day. The last of the ""great Victorian explorers"", he inspired the creation of Indiana Jones (and quite possibly Commander McBragg). He was as well known at the time as Dr. Livingstone, and had a reputation of being indestructible. He became obsessed with El Dorado, the mythical (?) city of gold, which he also referred to as Z. In 1925, he took his oldest son and one of his son's friends on an expedition into the jungles of Brazil to find it. They were never seen again outside of the Amazon. Over the course of the next decades, dozens of expeditions set out to find the Fawcett party, or traces of it, including other famous explorers of the time, an actor who had played an explorer (!), and Fawcett's younger son Brian. Some of them were also lost. In addition, many people died just looking for El Dorado. More modern science concluded that no complex civilization could have endured in the Amazon, in so hostile an environment.This book tells the story of Fawcett and traces this final expedition. The author even traveled to Brazil himself to try to follow Fawcett's last trail and try to find out what exactly happened to him. (When he reached one point where Fawcett had been in the jungle, he said that it looked ""like Nebraska"" now - deforestation is real.) Using Fawcett's private notes from previous trips that the family shared with him, as well as dispatches from his final one, Grann was able to find the spot where he thought they had started from (Fawcett had said one thing in his public notes for the Royal Geographic Society, to keep the exact location confidential because other explorers were out there looking. But Grann found another set of coordinates in Fawcett's private notes).I don't know anything about this man or his expeditions, but it seems to me that Grann has helped answer some of the questions that surrounded him. And maybe the Amazon isn't as hostile to agriculture and society as previously thought?On the other hand.... it is pretty much just waiting to kill you so I don't recommend trying it."
47,0385513534,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1758594-patrick-gibson,4,"This author was on the Colbert show a few nights ago. Even though Steven wouldn’t give the poor guy a chance to talk, the story seemed right up my alley so I picked up the book the next day. Isn’t that why authors appear on talk shows, so that numb-nuts like me will rush to Borders?Percy Harrison Fawcett was the real-life explorer whose adventures Arthur Conan Doyle drew upon for his 1912 novel ‘The Lost Word.’ While Fawcett did not find a South American plateau populated with dinosaurs, he did lead numerous expeditions looking for lost civilizations. On his last and most ambitious—seeking the City of Z—he vanished. Over the past seventy-five years there have been hundreds of other expeditions into the Amazon, by a myriad of adventurers, looking for Percy Fawcett. All failed. Hundreds died. Many were never heard from again.Fawcett marked the end of an age. He was the last of the individualist explores. The day of the airplane, the radio, the organized and heavily financed modern expedition had not arrived. With him, it was the heroic story of a man against a vast uncharted wilderness nearly the size of the continental United States inhabited by deadly warriors.Armed with newly discovered information found in a trunk by one of Fawcett’s grandchildren the author, after completing exhaustive research, decides to enter the Amazon and follow the path of Fawcett’s last journey. This is a little eye-brow lifting because the author is a middle aged slightly chunky New Yorker who is the complete opposite of the rigorously trained, physically fit, handsome Fawcett. Thus the consequence of obsession, I guess.Throughout the nineteenth century there was a tremendous speculation concerning the ‘lesser’ civilizations and their inability to reach a level of sophistication beyond living in huts and foraging for food. Darwin did nothing to dispel this attitude—in fact, augmented it. Fawcett was unique in his vision and belief that remote jungle societies could indeed build out of stone, decipher the movements of the stars and create a written language. Without any concrete knowledge of its existence, he was determined to find proof, in the form of a magnificent stone city—he called Z—in the blank parts of the Amazon maps.For Fawcett’s final, and according to him ‘definitive’ 1925 excursion, instead of a group of hunter/explorers, he took only his twenty-one year old son Jack, and Jack’s companion Raleigh Rimell (who really wanted to go to Hollywood and become a silent movie star). For a while the trio sent native runners out of the jungle with progress reports. Their messages would be telegraphed to cities in the United States and eventually newspapers around the world published accounts of their progress. The world literally followed their escapades like a serial novel. Then everything stopped. And the world went nuts. Every major geographical society mounted rescue parties. Finding Fawcett Fever lasted for years. Even in the 1950’s there were rumors Fawcett was still alive and lording like a king over a remote tribe. In the 1960’s, rescue parties were mounted and sent into the wilds. More people died searching for Fawcett than looking for the headwaters of the Nile or panning gold in the Pacific northwest. It’s a pretty amazing story and a whopping good read. The author knows how to pace his story and exactly the right time to intersperse details of his own trek though the tropical forest.I have always wondered about these curious lines from ‘Othello”:And of the Cannibals that each other eat,The Anthropophagi, and men whose headsDo grow beneath their shoulders.It comes from an idea Shakespeare borrowed from Sir Walter Raleigh writing about Francisco de Orellana, whose expedition into the Amazon vanished in 1542. One of the many Christian xenophobes who contributed to slavery in the Western hemisphere. (Raleigh, not Shakespeare.)The author doesn’t have an ending and the story looses its momentum towards the end, but it is an intriguing story, well researched and a very interesting read. Completely enjoyable."

All so common, and all such a snore. Now, even my exciting life in Italy is still tedious at times, albeit for different reasons.Then a book like this comes along to rip us out of the goddamn delirium of every day life. This is the true story of when men were men and the world was a place to be explored and conquered so that the blank places on maps could be filled in and the Queen could get a few more jewels in her crown. The ballsiest of all explorers, Percy Fawcett, thought that hiking through the Amazon in a search for the legendary city of El Dorado was a good way to spend his time. KICK ASS.

It was a worldwide publicized event, with Fawcett writing journal entries and having a messenger take them to the nearest large town to be sent via telegraph to the rest of the world. Then the entries suddenly stopped and Fawcett was never heard from again. Expeditions were made to discover what happened to them; nothing was ever found, while some more people were lost to the Amazon. The Lost City of Z is the story of Percy Fawcett, his life and how he became a great explorer, and where his obsession for the Amazon came from. It is also the story of the mystery of this doomed last expedition, and all the efforts – some ending in tragedy – that have been made since then.David Grann is a staff writer for the New Yorker who first found out about Percy Fawcett while researching an article on the mysterious death of the world’s foremost Sherlock Holmes expert. The Lost City of Z takes Grann all over the world, from visiting Fawcett’s great granddaughter and seeing some of his original journal entries, to putting together his own expedition to find out what really happened to Percy Fawcett. The Lost City of Z is the incredible story of one of the last explorers, but it is also the story of the strength of the human spirit and it’s drive to never give up.

I liked the format with the biographical and historical information interspersed with the authors research in libraries and archives, and shopping trips to adventure outfitters. How had I never heard of the Fawcett mystery until now? It seems like a story ripe for Hollywood or various adventure stories, so it is a wonder that it took this long to have some quality research on the topic (or have I just been ignorant of this?) Interesting aside - as I was reading this, my husband is reading Candice Millard's *River of Doubt* about Roosevelt's travels in Amazon. It was intriguing to hear the Grann citing that book, and for my husband and I to discuss the two expeditions and how they differed. I look forward to reading that book soon to continue my own little obsession with rainforest adventure stories...This book describes a very different Amazon than the one I encountered on my trip to Peru in 2007 - of course, I was not in the deepest darkest part of the forest, but we were ""roughing it"" by a lot of standards... I guess that is because over the last century there have been significant strides in public health and sanitation, disease prevention, and research on tropical climes... even in the author's travels in 2006 and 2007, he describes a very different Brazilian rainforest than Fawcett encountered 80 years prior. This alone causes some concern that things can change so significantly in the relatively short span of years..."

Fawcett's British colonial background, his early years, other explorations, his family, his involvement in the Royal Geographical Society and the colonial and imperialist mix that was current in the late 19th and early 20th century in England ... it's all filler.Finally, finally, FINALLY the author takes the reader on his recent journey to the same area where Fawcett was last reported. The upshot is still that no one knows what happened, despite numerous attempts by numerous people to find out. The book ends with a short description of recent archaeological discoveries in the region that have uncovered much larger population centers and could have given rise to stories about an El Dorado or Z.That's it. The book could have been condensed into 50 pages and told exactly the same story."

Tragically, Fawcett never found Z...or did he? Legend has it Fawcett was killed or captured by hostile tribes, starved to death, or perhaps as some fringe groups believe he transcended mortality when he found and entered the lost city of Z. Journalist David Grann finds new information regarding Fawcett's secret route and eventually follows Fawcett into an area of the world that still remains largely unknown - and hostile - to outsiders.

Along with that, the descriptions in the book are sometimes more than I would have liked, whether it be about bodies, diseases, deaths, etc. There were many bizarre religions mentioned, including the occult.The adventure Fawcett must have thrived on throughout his life was evident in this book, and it's what kept me reading when the story went on a tangent, which happened often. It would have been much easier to read if the author had chosen either his own experiences or Fawcett's to focus on throughout, as the jumps from one POV to the next were quite jarring most of the time. However, I did enjoy learning about the various journeys taken by both men.This was an informative book.

55,0385513534,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1256603-sara,5,"You wouldn't think that a book featuring lost civilizations in the Amazon rain forest, cannibals, wild beasts, natives shooting poisoned arrows, mad men, and more man eating bugs then I ever want to encounter in a book ever again would best be described as subtle but such is the case with the totally wicked awesome Lost City of Z.David Grann, a reporter for the New Yorker, becomes intrigued by the story of Percy Fawcett an explorer in the early 1900's who became internationally famous for his forays into the Amazon rain forest with little more then a machete and an almost god like ability to survive even the most insane situations. In the course of his explorations Fawcett became obsessed with the idea of a lost civilization somewhere in the Amazon, a technologically and culturally advanced society hidden somewhere in the dense, impenetrable jungle. I'm not spoiling anything to let you know that Fawcett never found his city, which he mysteriously nicknamed ""Z,"" at 58 he took his 22 year old son and his son's best friend into the jungle determined to finally find it. The three men never returned and a legend was born.Over the years hundreds of would be rescuers and explorers have attempted to learn the fate of the last Fawcett expedition and/or discover Fawcett's fabled city.Grann joins their ranks and determines to journey there himself, leaving a wife and newborn son in New York City, to try to find the truth.There are two perfectly blended journey's here. Grann takes a ""no apologies"" approach in his exploration of Fawcett's life. We meet the tireless, obsessed explorer, negligent father and husband and the aggressive, easily offended bully who called anyone who couldn't match his 10 mile treks through unexplored jungle a ""coward."" Fawcett was certainly a thoroughly unlikable person but, as Grann takes pains to point out, its impossible to ignore his strength, dedication and intelligence. He changed the more time he spent in the Amazon among the tribes that lived there. He came to question the Victorian ""make the world England"" approach that was playing the same role the Spanish had years earlier in killing, subjugating and erasing the people who had thrived there for a thousand years. He fought bitterly against his own nature and that of his country to argue that ""savage"" was an abhorrent term perhaps best used to describe those attempting to ""civilize"" a people far beyond them already.Then we have Grann who through his own journey to the Amazon comes to understand that for all Fawcett's successes he lost site of those closest to him, those who needed him and depended upon him. He realizes that he too has become so blind to everything but this quest that he's abandoned his own family without a second thought.So yes, this is a book about crazy amazing adventures and secrets in the jungle and its amazingly exciting and so much fun to listen to at night right before bed. It really is like Indiana Jones comes to life (hell there's apparently an Indiana Jones novel ABOUT Fawcett and his city) but its also about what we lose when we put dreams ahead of everything else. Subtle and heart stopping. A nice combo it turns out."
56,0385513534,http://goodreads.com/user/show/83144-el,4,"I love a good yarn. I love those crazy stories about hidden treasures, travels to the ends of the earth, and driving obsessions - the more real they are, the better.In the Twenties, explorer Percy Fawcett wandered into the jungles of the Amazon to find the Lost City of Z, aka the ancient civilization, El Dorado. He was obsessed with the concept of this hidden civilization, and spent years researching and studying before embarking on his journey. But what happened? We know that most of his team died along the way, and that he sent his then 21-year-old son back home. But then the story ends basically, because Fawcett never made it out of the jungle. Was he driven to death by his own obsession? Was he eaten by a ginormous snake? Did he find the Lost City of Z and decide to just hang there for the rest of his days? David Grann picks up the story by not necessarily answering those questions, but by trying to follow in Fawcett's footsteps. Well... without that pesky ""getting-lost-in-the-Amazon-and-probably-dying"" thing.This is an engrossing story and totally fulfilled the wannabe archeologist I have inside, all the while reminding me that I would never last in the Amazon. It's hot, it's humid, there are bugs I've never even imagined (and I'm not being especially girly - I'm talking about mosquitoes that suck the juice off your eyeballs or those annoying things that basically get inside your junk and can not be removed), vampire bats, and did I mention the humidity? Yeah, it's not really a place that I could call home, but Fawcett apparently could, and Grann sure as heck could at least hang with the best of them. More power to those guys.Still, the bouncing back and forth between Grann's own expedition and that of Fawcett's was distracting at times. It would have been better if Grann just took one storyline and ran with it as they are singularly pretty fascinating. But Grann did a decent job of finding primary sources to back his (and Fawcett's) claims. My list of books to hunt down now has increased exponentially, and I suppose I can thank Grann for that, though I think it has more to do with the absolute craziness that possessed Fawcett that makes me want to know more about him."
57,0385513534,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4026072-kim,4,"I love travel and adventure and ancient civiliations so a real-life journey is a must-read for me. It is amazing how many people had invested time, money and, in some cases, their lives to search for a group that people said shouldn't have gone in the first place. Maybe if those people had helped fund the expedition they wouldn't have gone missing. Or as some conspiracies say maybe he wanted to go missing.But there's a part of me that would have also wanted to rush out looking for him. And that's the part that believes in the lost city of Z. Not the city of gold or the gilded man but the ancient civilization of the Amazon. The people and cities the original European explorers reported that were never seen again. And which science and archaeologists are finally confirming as being real. I would love to join the digs in South America, maybe one day I will.So why only 4 stars? The book is too short. I know it was originally written as an article and then extended but it was over too quick. I was really getting into the story and the discoveries when it finished. Now I'll have to find more books on the subject."

Grann's descriptions of all the horrible ways the Amazon can invade the body make me never want to stand in a forest again. However, the book did end on a good note: in awe of the great unknown civilizations that not only survive but thrived in the Amazon. I also found Grann's portrayal of the individuals that journeyed into the Amazon (and the people they left behind) interesting enough in themselves. What kind of people are compelled again and again to enter into a lonely hell? "

Grann's descriptions of Fawcett et al trampling through the amazonian rainforest with their crass, (often racist) imperialist delusions of grandeur and discovery are often gut-wrenching. Skin peels off in sheets, everyone gets malaria, parasites, maggot infections (shudder), gangrene, etc. Trekking through unspoiled tropical jungles is utterly horrifying, you basically just turn yourself into an oozing, walking meal and wait for the rainforest to literally devour you. Grann remains fairly non-judgmental through out. After all, it's the green hell of the jungle itself which finally breaks down and destroys hubris and good intentions alike. Seriously, some of this stuff would make Werner Herzog blush."

For most of the book I thought Percy Fawcett (the explorer whom the book is about) was probably a complete wack-a-doodle. At the end of the book, maybe only partially a wack-a-doodle but you do have to be somewhat obsessed to keep going back into that environment looking for a fabled ""Lost City"". I cannot fathom trekking into the Amazon jungle in our times with modern technology let alone in the 1920's when Fawcett did it. It is not a place I would ever desire to experience, just on the bug issue alone! Gross stuff in there!! The book is a bit long in places but overall pretty good.(Why is GR marking everything as read twice when it's only been read once?). Maddening!"

The author also has a new non-fiction book to be published in April, 2017: Killers of the Flower Moon. My original review:: ""This is a very readable, well researched book. It focuses on explorer Colonel Percy Fawcett, and his obsession to find a great. ancient city deep in the Amazon jungle which he called Z. Z ,if it existed, may have given rise to the legend of El Dorado. The book tells the story of Fawcett's quests, and of the author attempting to journey to the Amazon to try to solve some of the mystery around Fawcett's mysterious disappearance on his 1925 expedition.  Anyone interested in early 20th century exploration and past and present day Amazonia should enjoy this book. Prior to his ill-fated journey, Fawcett had explored the Amazon several times before. He was an arrogant man, rarely getting along with those who accompanied him on his journeys. He seemed immune to most tropical illnesses and scorned those who became ill or couldn't keep up to his break-neck pace, regarding them as weak. His obsession to find Z bordered on madness as he consulted spiritualists. The author found that his papers showed ever increasing bizarre beliefs. For his last journey he advertised for strong men to accompany him (no women allowed). A large number of scientists, explorers, athletes and people wanting adventure or just wishing to get just away from home replied. Among those turned down was Lawrence of Arabia . Fawcett felt that a person used to the desert would never keep up to him in the jungle. Instead he decided to go accompanied by his 21 year old son and the son's best friend.  As Fawcett was very secretive, not wanting any rival explorer to find Z before he did, his exact route was unknown or sometimes written in code. The disappearance of Fawcett and the two young men caused a sensation, and countless people also vanished or died searching for them.It also tells the stories of other explorers in the early part half of the 1800's. These adventurers have now been replaced by archaeologists and anthropologists. Grann discovers in his journey a ruins which may have led to the legend of Z which is now being studied and excavated, and he believes he knows the fate of Fawcett and the two young men from stories passed on by several Indian tribes."""
64,0385513534,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6969151-veeral,4,"That obnoxious Amazon. It likes to monopolize and dominate the jungle. Although one might be led to believe that there would be an abundance of everything where such a mighty force exists, the truth is exactly the opposite. As David Grann puts it himself: It’s the great “counterfeit paradise”. I couldn’t agree more. Amazon will starve you. Amazon will desiccate you. And finally, Amazon will obliterate you. Because, simply put, Amazon doesn’t care for you. It’s a green desert. Unfit for human civilization.Take the example of Colonel Percy Harrison Fawcett. He wanted to make “the great discovery of the century” by finding the cryptic lost City of Z but instead, the uncaring Amazon rainforest consumed him, his son (Jack) and his son’s friend (Raleigh Rimell). So, “the great discovery of the century” became infamous as what has often been described as “the greatest exploration mystery of the twentieth century”— that is, the mystery of the fate of Percy Fawcett and the whereabouts of the lost City of Z.Many have tried to solve the mystery over the years, but failed.No one could find exactly what happened to Fawcett and certainly no one could find any clues that Z ever existed. But why should it exist? It was really pointless of us to assume right from the start that a civilization could prosper under something as brutal and vainglorious as Amazon. Sure, Grann did made some flimsy attempts by the end of the book by hinting that a civilized colony might have existed in the Amazon in the past, but that didn’t half-convince me.So, one thing I would definitely take away from this book is the fact that, Amazon is the bane of civilization."
65,0385513534,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5858699-kavita,4,"David Grann is a journalist, who got fascinated with the legend of Percy Fawcett, the Amazon explorer who disappeared into the Amazon in 1925, along with his son and his son's friend. Fawcett's obsession with an ancient and highly complex civilisation within the Amazon rainforest forms the basis of this book. Grann sets out to prove that Fawcett was right, and makes a journey into the Amazon himself.The Lost City of Z is basically a biography of Fawcett and concentrates on his quest for the legendary city that he called Z. I originally assumed that it was Grann's own journey into the Amazon which would be described here. There were short chapters in which he got ready to enter the forest, and since the story was not about it, it all turned out to be superficial. It would have been much better if Grann had concentrated solely on the Fawcett story.Interestingly, Grann quotes from the writings of Spanish conquistadors who had travelled the Amazon in the 1500s. Their descriptions varied from those of Fawcett, because by then, the local tribes had been wiped out massively and the region deforested. Grann's own journey showed yet more deforestation and extinction of life since the 1900s. Sadly, a few hundred years down the line, we might not have an Amazon rainforest left despite its vastness, so these accounts are valuable. The real appeal of the book, of course, lies in the fact that you can enjoy the deadly rainforest from the comfort of your couch. Not for us the risking of our lives and confronting snakes, mosquitoes, and other creatures of the rainforest, not to mention battling disease, hunger, and thirst. For us, the delight of expertly sliding into a beautiful world you can romanticise without really having to move a muscle. The Inferno Verde can become a Paraíso Verde."
66,0385513534,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39134508-kathleen,4,"This book was chosen by my book club as the non-fiction book for the month. I am hoping that it will qualify for a Bingo square - name of a city in the title ""Lost City of Z"". David Grann is a reporter and states at the beginning of the book that he isn't the type to get involved in the stories he works on and researches. Once he finishes a story he moves on to the next one. But like other adventurers, David did get caught up in the ""greatest exploration mystery of the twentieth century"" and set out to solve the story about the disappearance of British explorer Perry Faucett, and his son in the Amazon. What happened to them while they were searching for the Lost City of Z? This is a very informative and interesting non-fiction book that reads much like an Indiana Jones adventure story. David Grann expertly weaves geography, history and science together resulting in a breath-taking narrative. I listened to the audiobook of this story narrated by the talented Mark Deakins. He is one of my favourite narrators because he uses different voices for each character, and the voices seem to fit the character -bringing the story ""alive"". (I have read over 160 audio books and feel this audiobook enhanced my experience reading this book. If you are new to audio books, I think you should opt for reading this in print.)I highly recommend this non-fiction book for readers interested in history, explorations, and the Amazon."

This is a new classic of the narrative nonfiction genre.The prose is vivid and intoxicating, and he weaves together 2+ threads, seamlessly--with the Fawcett thread dominant, as it should be, yet given fresh life with the mingling of the contemporary thread.I was drawn in from the start, but oddly enough, I REALLY got fascinated when he got to the developing field of cultural anthropology, and the fights over whether the people in the Amazon were ""noble savages"" or just ""savages,"" or stupid subhumans, or . . . and what the apparent tiny population really meant. Throughout the book, there was an adventure story going on, but a much wider, deeper consideration of how the discoveries there fundamentally altered our conceptions of how and why we all are the way we are. And it crept into those ideas artfully, interestingly and never pedantically. It never bogged down into a university course: felt more like an exciting speaker spurring our curiosity and helping us run with it.So well done. I'll use this as one of my models for all my future books.(And as a writer, I can't resist saying: Great verbs! I mean, stupendously great, every page, every paragraph. Never too much, consistently just right.)"

In fact, I remember clearly that I didn't want to see it. The name sounded silly, and I had no clue what it was about. Visions of pirates and space creatures clouded my judgment. Luckily, my friends dragged me in by majority vote and I emerged from the theater two hours later, exhilarated, endlessly curious about early human cultures, and determined to live a more exciting life. And it stuck. Years later, I stood in the middle of Albuquerque receiving my degree in Anthropology, still consumed with a passion for learning about ancient human history and lost worlds. Percy Fawcett, the adventurer, explorer, and land surveyor at the heart of ""The Lost City of Z"" would have most likely seen a lot of himself in Indiana Jones. If ever there were a real-life version of the intrepid anthropologist, Fawcett would definitely be a frontrunner. And fate seemed to lead him there. In his early military years in Ceylon, Fawcett heard the legend of a lost city buried beneath an earthen mound near his base. He took it upon himself to try to locate this lost world, and appears to have had some success, although he did not have the wherewithal at the time to excavate it. Still, the thrill of the find and the desire to pursue other ""lost worlds"" grabbed hold of him then, and planted the seed of obsession that would follow him throughout the rest of his life. Working for the Royal Geographical Society, Fawcett was sent to the largely uncharted and dangerous forests of the Amazon. By many accounts, there seems to be no crueler environment in the world. When I was once contemplating graduate field work, I recalled the stories of an anthropologist who had visited our class to tell us about his work with the Yanamami, a tribe so fascinating and remote that many classmates later expressed their desire to do the same. But me? Not in the least. I knew the last place on earth I ever wanted to live - even for a short time - was within the bug-infested, snake-laden, vampire-bat heavy jaguar lair that is the Amazon. Mosquitoes love me here in New England. Imagine the feast I would provide them in the rain forest. I would be nearly bloodless in a week. But Fawcett, he was made for the place. Surveying the formerly unexplored (by white men) border between Brazil and Bolivia, he accomplished his mission nearly a year ahead of schedule. This despite losing half his team to disease, the arrows of hostile tribes, parasitic worms, viral infections, and starvation. By all accounts, Fawcett was impervious to disease, boasting a hardy constitution unphased by the rigors of a jungle so dense that a day's worth of hacking through it with machetes sometimes only gained the team a half a mile of advancement. His amazing physical stamina and seeming disdain for the suffering of others bred one of two things in the men who served him: intense loyalty or mutinous desire. The tales of both of these conditions in his many journeys back into the jungle after his acclaimed first mission, are the stuff of legend. But, somewhere along the way, Fawcett began to hear about a Lost City, much like the famed El Dorado, a city of vast palaces and towering pillars, filled with riches and covered in gold dust. Having encountered a smaller version of this phenomenon in Ceylon, Fawcett became intrigued. As time went on, intrigue turned to obsession, as more and more of the oral histories he encountered in the tribes he befriended, as well as the geographical and archaeological record that had newly been discovered began to substantiate the claims. When Hiram Bingham discovered Machu Picchu during the same time period as Fawcett's work, it only fueled his desire to find his own ""lost world."" ""The Lost City of Z"" is brilliantly told and exhaustively researched by David Grann. Needless to say, Fawcett's final mission involved a last ditch effort to find the city, taking only his grown son, his son's best friend and a couple of temporary native guides. They went into the forest in 1925 and were never heard from again. Since that time, literally hundreds of amateur explorers have trekked into the same hostile jungles to try to find the missing Colonel and his companions. As recently as 1995, a Bolivian businessman and his grown son (along with an expert team and the best technological aids) tried to finally find out what happened to the Fawcett team all those years ago, only to find themselves taken captive by an Amazonian tribe. (The tribe debated whether or not to kill them for three days until finally releasing them in exchange for their thirty thousand dollars worth of equipment.) And this was 1995 - not 1925. It is no wonder that Grann himself finally feels compelled to witness the land where Percy Fawcett was lost forever. His journey, which he documents late in the book, is far more eventful than I would have imagined, and his final meeting with the anthropologist Michael Hecklenberger, who has lived in the Amazon for over a dozen years now, was insightful and educational. For anyone who has ever felt the pull of exploration, imagined the thrill of a lost world, or even just really enjoyed the exploits of Indiana Jones, pick up this fascinating book. I doubt it will make you want to trek through the Amazon, (in fact, it may dissuade you from going to a jungle anywhere, ever, under any circumstances), but it might just make you want to explore a new culture, visit a museum, or even just take the long way home. And if it does, Percy Fawcett may have succeeded in some small way."
71,0385513534,http://goodreads.com/user/show/798978-barbara,5,"The story of ""Colonel"" Fawcett, and his explorations of the Amazon were once world known. Fawcett was searching for a legendary city in the jungle. He began his explorations in the 19th century. In the Victorian Age exploration was done by amateurs, and the field of anthropology was in its infancy. Fawcett's trips were financed by the Royal Geographic Society in London. Fawcett was relentless, driving his family into bankruptcy. On his final trip in 1925, he and his son, and a third man, disappeared.The descriptions of the explorations were hair raising. The insects were not only pests but dangerous. I won't go into detail but their effect on humans are disgusting. There was also danger from some the the warlike tribes, who as recently as the 1990's killed outsiders who wandered into their territory.The author Grann decides to investigate Fawcett and the ""lost city"". This book is mostly a report of Fawcett's life, and expeditions. He was famous not only for his numerous journeys, but his ability to form friendships with Amazon Indians, and his appreciation of their way of life. Grann himself travels to Brazil over a 100 years after Fawcett disappeared. This is a fascinating account, and one I found hard to put down."
72,0385513534,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1605591-christine,5,"	Shortly after I finished this book, the BBC World Service reported that a Brazilian man who advocated for small farmers, natives, and the rain forest was murdered. He was shot five times in the head while biking with his wife. The same report made reference to the 2005 killing of an American nun, a murder that Grann mentions in his book. What the news report drove home was the idea that the Amazon is still a dangerous place, just not exactly in the same way it was during Fawcett’s time. Instead of worrying about how a misunderstanding with a native tribe could end in the death of tribal members or of the group of explorers, the battle is now between business and various types of conversation. In many ways, a more violent battle, not just because everyone has guns.	This idea is not wholly examined in The Lost City of Z, though David Grann does touch on it in the closing chapters of his book, and the idea of the destruction of the natural world does run though a good portion of the book.	Much of the book is about Fawcett and his various trips to the Amazon; culminating in what was undoubtedly a fatal trip to find a “lost” city that he had named Z.	In fact, if you are going to learn anything from this book (and you are), the most important is the simple fact that if the natives tell you not to do something or go somewhere, LISTEN TO THEM! THEY KNOW FROM WHENCE THEY SPEAK!	(I’m using the slightly political incorrect term of natives because I am a good American who has been taught that Indian refers to a person from India. South American Native Americans is way too wordy, there too many tribes to list all the tribe names, and the term Native American or First People [nations:] would make me sound like the news anchor on CNN who referred to the African immigrants protesting/rioting in Paris a few years back as African-Americans.)	Fawcett was a man who spent more time in the Amazon then with his family. As an aside, Grann does a wonderful job of showing the strength of character of both Nina Fawcett and Grann’s own wife, making both women sound just as, if not more, heroic than their husbands. In fact, Mr. Grann, your wife sounds far more intelligent than you. (Sorry, don’t mean to offend, but she knew you needed more than sneakers before heading into the Amazon). The men who explored the Amazon seemed to have married very understand and supportive women (and, if possible, very rich women). While her husband was dealing with nasty bugs and a fish that could swim up his wee-wee, Nina Fawcett was giving birth to their second child, raising their first (eventually raising all three children), keeping house, and protecting her husband’s reputation, all of this on a rather limited budget.	To be far, Fawcett seemed to know that he was unworthy of her. This is what makes the book charming. It’s warts and all, and the people who have warts, know they have them. It’s very human.	Fawcett became convinced that there was lost civilization in the Amazon, basically a version of the city of gold myth. It was during an attempt to find this city that Fawcett, his eldest son Jack, and his son’s closest friend disappeared in the Amazon. The disappearance set off searches, rescue missions, and theories (such as this book), possibly resulting in another 100 deaths/disappearances.	Grann seems aware of his obsession and the risks it brings to both himself and his family. In fact, it seems like this is going to be his only big adventure. It seems he learned a lesson that Fawcett didn’t or couldn’t learn.	In some ways, the most interesting part of the book is the closing chapter which describes what a lost civilization in the Amazon is truly. Think the Incas, the Mayans, the Aztecs but in a different country. If the rain forest is turned wholly over to big business, if its defenders and supporters are murdered then not only do the flora and fauna of the Amazon disappear, not only do tribal cultures (if not whole tribes) die, but the Lost City of Z will still forever be lost."

While not really giving any sort of definitive answer to what happened to Percy Fawcett on his last expedition, the book was a wonderfully researched book on turn of the century amateur exploration and the competition that ensued between these gentleman rivals.While the final discovery was a great vindication of those explorers who felt that there had to be some sort of great civilization in the Amazon region, we are still not sure that Z has been or ever will be found.Nonetheless, this is one journey that I was happy to make with the author and am amazed at the treasure trove of new information he was able to provide everyone."

The story of real-life adventurer Fawcett was interesting in itself, of course, but maybe not quite five stars. HOWEVER, I was pleasantly surprised that the book also gave me a sense of early 20th popular culture. I walked away with a new perspective on the environment that produced stories like The Lost World and At the Mountains of Madness. Also, I have scratched the deep amazon off my list of places to go hiking."

76,0385513534,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35799-amy,4,"Colonel Percy Harrison Fawcett was quite a famous explorer in his day. The last of the ""great Victorian explorers"", he inspired the creation of Indiana Jones (and quite possibly Commander McBragg). He was as well known at the time as Dr. Livingstone, and had a reputation of being indestructible. He became obsessed with El Dorado, the mythical (?) city of gold, which he also referred to as Z. In 1925, he took his oldest son and one of his son's friends on an expedition into the jungles of Brazil to find it. They were never seen again outside of the Amazon. Over the course of the next decades, dozens of expeditions set out to find the Fawcett party, or traces of it, including other famous explorers of the time, an actor who had played an explorer (!), and Fawcett's younger son Brian. Some of them were also lost. In addition, many people died just looking for El Dorado. More modern science concluded that no complex civilization could have endured in the Amazon, in so hostile an environment.This book tells the story of Fawcett and traces this final expedition. The author even traveled to Brazil himself to try to follow Fawcett's last trail and try to find out what exactly happened to him. (When he reached one point where Fawcett had been in the jungle, he said that it looked ""like Nebraska"" now - deforestation is real.) Using Fawcett's private notes from previous trips that the family shared with him, as well as dispatches from his final one, Grann was able to find the spot where he thought they had started from (Fawcett had said one thing in his public notes for the Royal Geographic Society, to keep the exact location confidential because other explorers were out there looking. But Grann found another set of coordinates in Fawcett's private notes).I don't know anything about this man or his expeditions, but it seems to me that Grann has helped answer some of the questions that surrounded him. And maybe the Amazon isn't as hostile to agriculture and society as previously thought?On the other hand.... it is pretty much just waiting to kill you so I don't recommend trying it."

Even though Steven wouldn’t give the poor guy a chance to talk, the story seemed right up my alley so I picked up the book the next day. Isn’t that why authors appear on talk shows, so that numb-nuts like me will rush to Borders?Percy Harrison Fawcett was the real-life explorer whose adventures Arthur Conan Doyle drew upon for his 1912 novel ‘The Lost Word.’ While Fawcett did not find a South American plateau populated with dinosaurs, he did lead numerous expeditions looking for lost civilizations. On his last and most ambitious—seeking the City of Z—he vanished. Over the past seventy-five years there have been hundreds of other expeditions into the Amazon, by a myriad of adventurers, looking for Percy Fawcett. All failed. Hundreds died. Many were never heard from again.Fawcett marked the end of an age. He was the last of the individualist explores. The day of the airplane, the radio, the organized and heavily financed modern expedition had not arrived. With him, it was the heroic story of a man against a vast uncharted wilderness nearly the size of the continental United States inhabited by deadly warriors.Armed with newly discovered information found in a trunk by one of Fawcett’s grandchildren the author, after completing exhaustive research, decides to enter the Amazon and follow the path of Fawcett’s last journey. This is a little eye-brow lifting because the author is a middle aged slightly chunky New Yorker who is the complete opposite of the rigorously trained, physically fit, handsome Fawcett. Thus the consequence of obsession, I guess.Throughout the nineteenth century there was a tremendous speculation concerning the ‘lesser’ civilizations and their inability to reach a level of sophistication beyond living in huts and foraging for food. Darwin did nothing to dispel this attitude—in fact, augmented it. Fawcett was unique in his vision and belief that remote jungle societies could indeed build out of stone, decipher the movements of the stars and create a written language. Without any concrete knowledge of its existence, he was determined to find proof, in the form of a magnificent stone city—he called Z—in the blank parts of the Amazon maps.For Fawcett’s final, and according to him ‘definitive’ 1925 excursion, instead of a group of hunter/explorers, he took only his twenty-one year old son Jack, and Jack’s companion Raleigh Rimell (who really wanted to go to Hollywood and become a silent movie star). For a while the trio sent native runners out of the jungle with progress reports. Their messages would be telegraphed to cities in the United States and eventually newspapers around the world published accounts of their progress. The world literally followed their escapades like a serial novel. Then everything stopped. And the world went nuts. Every major geographical society mounted rescue parties. Finding Fawcett Fever lasted for years. Even in the 1950’s there were rumors Fawcett was still alive and lording like a king over a remote tribe. In the 1960’s, rescue parties were mounted and sent into the wilds. More people died searching for Fawcett than looking for the headwaters of the Nile or panning gold in the Pacific northwest. It’s a pretty amazing story and a whopping good read. The author knows how to pace his story and exactly the right time to intersperse details of his own trek though the tropical forest.I have always wondered about these curious lines from ‘Othello”:And of the Cannibals that each other eat,The Anthropophagi, and men whose headsDo grow beneath their shoulders.It comes from an idea Shakespeare borrowed from Sir Walter Raleigh writing about Francisco de Orellana, whose expedition into the Amazon vanished in 1542. One of the many Christian xenophobes who contributed to slavery in the Western hemisphere. (Raleigh, not Shakespeare.)The author doesn’t have an ending and the story looses its momentum towards the end, but it is an intriguing story, well researched and a very interesting read. Completely enjoyable."

That is, talking about sales forecasts, writing up spread sheets and cursing Excel when I couldn't copy/paste from one cell to another, and being encouraged to think of ways I could improve the company while knowing I could be laid off at any minute. All so common, and all such a snore. Now, even my exciting life in Italy is still tedious at times, albeit for different reasons.Then a book like this comes along to rip us out of the goddamn delirium of every day life. This is the true story of when men were men and the world was a place to be explored and conquered so that the blank places on maps could be filled in and the Queen could get a few more jewels in her crown. The ballsiest of all explorers, Percy Fawcett, thought that hiking through the Amazon in a search for the legendary city of El Dorado was a good way to spend his time. KICK ASS. And there's even more fun here: swarming mosquitoes that carry disease, small catfish that like to lodge themselves IN the anus or urethra and can only be removed by surgery, blood-sucking bats, disease, parasites, and Indians in the bush just waiting to shoot you with poison arrows and shrink your head, sell it to collectors, and have it turn up in a pawn shop in Vegas. WICKED! Fawcett's eventual disappearance and the likelihood that an ancient, advanced civilization thrived in the Amazon and was wiped out by conquistadors are sobering reminders that this incredible story is as true as it gets. This book is a mystery, an adventure tale, and travelogue all rolled into one fly-through read. And it's the kind of thing that makes spreadsheets, the 9 to 5 drill, and even Excel, bearable.

It was a worldwide publicized event, with Fawcett writing journal entries and having a messenger take them to the nearest large town to be sent via telegraph to the rest of the world. Then the entries suddenly stopped and Fawcett was never heard from again. Expeditions were made to discover what happened to them; nothing was ever found, while some more people were lost to the Amazon. The Lost City of Z is the story of Percy Fawcett, his life and how he became a great explorer, and where his obsession for the Amazon came from. It is also the story of the mystery of this doomed last expedition, and all the efforts – some ending in tragedy – that have been made since then.David Grann is a staff writer for the New Yorker who first found out about Percy Fawcett while researching an article on the mysterious death of the world’s foremost Sherlock Holmes expert. The Lost City of Z takes Grann all over the world, from visiting Fawcett’s great granddaughter and seeing some of his original journal entries, to putting together his own expedition to find out what really happened to Percy Fawcett. The Lost City of Z is the incredible story of one of the last explorers, but it is also the story of the strength of the human spirit and it’s drive to never give up. Percy Fawcett was a real life Indiana Jones and this is his fascinating story.Originally written on February 9th 2010 ©Alex C. Telander.For more reviews and author interviews, go to Bookbanter.net"

I liked the format with the biographical and historical information interspersed with the authors research in libraries and archives, and shopping trips to adventure outfitters. How had I never heard of the Fawcett mystery until now? It seems like a story ripe for Hollywood or various adventure stories, so it is a wonder that it took this long to have some quality research on the topic (or have I just been ignorant of this?) Interesting aside - as I was reading this, my husband is reading Candice Millard's *River of Doubt* about Roosevelt's travels in Amazon. It was intriguing to hear the Grann citing that book, and for my husband and I to discuss the two expeditions and how they differed. I look forward to reading that book soon to continue my own little obsession with rainforest adventure stories...This book describes a very different Amazon than the one I encountered on my trip to Peru in 2007 - of course, I was not in the deepest darkest part of the forest, but we were ""roughing it"" by a lot of standards... I guess that is because over the last century there have been significant strides in public health and sanitation, disease prevention, and research on tropical climes... even in the author's travels in 2006 and 2007, he describes a very different Brazilian rainforest than Fawcett encountered 80 years prior. This alone causes some concern that things can change so significantly in the relatively short span of years..."

Fawcett's British colonial background, his early years, other explorations, his family, his involvement in the Royal Geographical Society and the colonial and imperialist mix that was current in the late 19th and early 20th century in England ... it's all filler.Finally, finally, FINALLY the author takes the reader on his recent journey to the same area where Fawcett was last reported. The upshot is still that no one knows what happened, despite numerous attempts by numerous people to find out. The book ends with a short description of recent archaeological discoveries in the region that have uncovered much larger population centers and could have given rise to stories about an El Dorado or Z.That's it. The book could have been condensed into 50 pages and told exactly the same story."

Legend has it Fawcett was killed or captured by hostile tribes, starved to death, or perhaps as some fringe groups believe he transcended mortality when he found and entered the lost city of Z. Journalist David Grann finds new information regarding Fawcett's secret route and eventually follows Fawcett into an area of the world that still remains largely unknown - and hostile - to outsiders.

Along with that, the descriptions in the book are sometimes more than I would have liked, whether it be about bodies, diseases, deaths, etc. There were many bizarre religions mentioned, including the occult.The adventure Fawcett must have thrived on throughout his life was evident in this book, and it's what kept me reading when the story went on a tangent, which happened often. It would have been much easier to read if the author had chosen either his own experiences or Fawcett's to focus on throughout, as the jumps from one POV to the next were quite jarring most of the time.

In the course of his explorations Fawcett became obsessed with the idea of a lost civilization somewhere in the Amazon, a technologically and culturally advanced society hidden somewhere in the dense, impenetrable jungle. I'm not spoiling anything to let you know that Fawcett never found his city, which he mysteriously nicknamed ""Z,"" at 58 he took his 22 year old son and his son's best friend into the jungle determined to finally find it. The three men never returned and a legend was born.Over the years hundreds of would be rescuers and explorers have attempted to learn the fate of the last Fawcett expedition and/or discover Fawcett's fabled city.Grann joins their ranks and determines to journey there himself, leaving a wife and newborn son in New York City, to try to find the truth.There are two perfectly blended journey's here. Grann takes a ""no apologies"" approach in his exploration of Fawcett's life. We meet the tireless, obsessed explorer, negligent father and husband and the aggressive, easily offended bully who called anyone who couldn't match his 10 mile treks through unexplored jungle a ""coward."" Fawcett was certainly a thoroughly unlikable person but, as Grann takes pains to point out, its impossible to ignore his strength, dedication and intelligence. He changed the more time he spent in the Amazon among the tribes that lived there. He came to question the Victorian ""make the world England"" approach that was playing the same role the Spanish had years earlier in killing, subjugating and erasing the people who had thrived there for a thousand years. He fought bitterly against his own nature and that of his country to argue that ""savage"" was an abhorrent term perhaps best used to describe those attempting to ""civilize"" a people far beyond them already.Then we have Grann who through his own journey to the Amazon comes to understand that for all Fawcett's successes he lost site of those closest to him, those who needed him and depended upon him. He realizes that he too has become so blind to everything but this quest that he's abandoned his own family without a second thought.So yes, this is a book about crazy amazing adventures and secrets in the jungle and its amazingly exciting and so much fun to listen to at night right before bed. It really is like Indiana Jones comes to life (hell there's apparently an Indiana Jones novel ABOUT Fawcett and his city) but its also about what we lose when we put dreams ahead of everything else. Subtle and heart stopping. A nice combo it turns out."
86,0385513534,http://goodreads.com/user/show/83144-el,4,"I love a good yarn. I love those crazy stories about hidden treasures, travels to the ends of the earth, and driving obsessions - the more real they are, the better.In the Twenties, explorer Percy Fawcett wandered into the jungles of the Amazon to find the Lost City of Z, aka the ancient civilization, El Dorado. He was obsessed with the concept of this hidden civilization, and spent years researching and studying before embarking on his journey. But what happened? We know that most of his team died along the way, and that he sent his then 21-year-old son back home. But then the story ends basically, because Fawcett never made it out of the jungle. Was he driven to death by his own obsession? Was he eaten by a ginormous snake? Did he find the Lost City of Z and decide to just hang there for the rest of his days? David Grann picks up the story by not necessarily answering those questions, but by trying to follow in Fawcett's footsteps. Well... without that pesky ""getting-lost-in-the-Amazon-and-probably-dying"" thing.This is an engrossing story and totally fulfilled the wannabe archeologist I have inside, all the while reminding me that I would never last in the Amazon. It's hot, it's humid, there are bugs I've never even imagined (and I'm not being especially girly - I'm talking about mosquitoes that suck the juice off your eyeballs or those annoying things that basically get inside your junk and can not be removed), vampire bats, and did I mention the humidity? Yeah, it's not really a place that I could call home, but Fawcett apparently could, and Grann sure as heck could at least hang with the best of them. More power to those guys.Still, the bouncing back and forth between Grann's own expedition and that of Fawcett's was distracting at times. It would have been better if Grann just took one storyline and ran with it as they are singularly pretty fascinating. But Grann did a decent job of finding primary sources to back his (and Fawcett's) claims. My list of books to hunt down now has increased exponentially, and I suppose I can thank Grann for that, though I think it has more to do with the absolute craziness that possessed Fawcett that makes me want to know more about him."
87,0385513534,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4026072-kim,4,"I love travel and adventure and ancient civiliations so a real-life journey is a must-read for me. It is amazing how many people had invested time, money and, in some cases, their lives to search for a group that people said shouldn't have gone in the first place. Maybe if those people had helped fund the expedition they wouldn't have gone missing. Or as some conspiracies say maybe he wanted to go missing.But there's a part of me that would have also wanted to rush out looking for him. And that's the part that believes in the lost city of Z. Not the city of gold or the gilded man but the ancient civilization of the Amazon. The people and cities the original European explorers reported that were never seen again. And which science and archaeologists are finally confirming as being real. I would love to join the digs in South America, maybe one day I will.So why only 4 stars? The book is too short. I know it was originally written as an article and then extended but it was over too quick. I was really getting into the story and the discoveries when it finished. Now I'll have to find more books on the subject."

Grann's descriptions of all the horrible ways the Amazon can invade the body make me never want to stand in a forest again. However, the book did end on a good note: in awe of the great unknown civilizations that not only survive but thrived in the Amazon. I also found Grann's portrayal of the individuals that journeyed into the Amazon (and the people they left behind) interesting enough in themselves. What kind of people are compelled again and again to enter into a lonely hell? "

90,0385513534,http://goodreads.com/user/show/869064-jeremy,3,"This is kind of an odd accomplishment: an adventure book that will make you really really glad your not an adventurer. Grann's descriptions of Fawcett et al trampling through the amazonian rainforest with their crass, (often racist) imperialist delusions of grandeur and discovery are often gut-wrenching. Skin peels off in sheets, everyone gets malaria, parasites, maggot infections (shudder), gangrene, etc. Trekking through unspoiled tropical jungles is utterly horrifying, you basically just turn yourself into an oozing, walking meal and wait for the rainforest to literally devour you. Grann remains fairly non-judgmental through out. After all, it's the green hell of the jungle itself which finally breaks down and destroys hubris and good intentions alike. Seriously, some of this stuff would make Werner Herzog blush."

For most of the book I thought Percy Fawcett (the explorer whom the book is about) was probably a complete wack-a-doodle. At the end of the book, maybe only partially a wack-a-doodle but you do have to be somewhat obsessed to keep going back into that environment looking for a fabled ""Lost City"". I cannot fathom trekking into the Amazon jungle in our times with modern technology let alone in the 1920's when Fawcett did it. It is not a place I would ever desire to experience, just on the bug issue alone! Gross stuff in there!! The book is a bit long in places but overall pretty good.(Why is GR marking everything as read twice when it's only been read once?). Maddening!"

The author also has a new non-fiction book to be published in April, 2017: Killers of the Flower Moon. My original review:: ""This is a very readable, well researched book. It focuses on explorer Colonel Percy Fawcett, and his obsession to find a great. ancient city deep in the Amazon jungle which he called Z. Z ,if it existed, may have given rise to the legend of El Dorado. The book tells the story of Fawcett's quests, and of the author attempting to journey to the Amazon to try to solve some of the mystery around Fawcett's mysterious disappearance on his 1925 expedition.  Anyone interested in early 20th century exploration and past and present day Amazonia should enjoy this book. Prior to his ill-fated journey, Fawcett had explored the Amazon several times before. He was an arrogant man, rarely getting along with those who accompanied him on his journeys. He seemed immune to most tropical illnesses and scorned those who became ill or couldn't keep up to his break-neck pace, regarding them as weak. His obsession to find Z bordered on madness as he consulted spiritualists. The author found that his papers showed ever increasing bizarre beliefs. For his last journey he advertised for strong men to accompany him (no women allowed). A large number of scientists, explorers, athletes and people wanting adventure or just wishing to get just away from home replied. Among those turned down was Lawrence of Arabia . Fawcett felt that a person used to the desert would never keep up to him in the jungle. Instead he decided to go accompanied by his 21 year old son and the son's best friend.  As Fawcett was very secretive, not wanting any rival explorer to find Z before he did, his exact route was unknown or sometimes written in code. The disappearance of Fawcett and the two young men caused a sensation, and countless people also vanished or died searching for them.It also tells the stories of other explorers in the early part half of the 1800's. These adventurers have now been replaced by archaeologists and anthropologists. Grann discovers in his journey a ruins which may have led to the legend of Z which is now being studied and excavated, and he believes he knows the fate of Fawcett and the two young men from stories passed on by several Indian tribes."""
94,0385513534,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6969151-veeral,4,"That obnoxious Amazon. It likes to monopolize and dominate the jungle. Although one might be led to believe that there would be an abundance of everything where such a mighty force exists, the truth is exactly the opposite. As David Grann puts it himself: It’s the great “counterfeit paradise”. I couldn’t agree more. Amazon will starve you. Amazon will desiccate you. And finally, Amazon will obliterate you. Because, simply put, Amazon doesn’t care for you. It’s a green desert. Unfit for human civilization.Take the example of Colonel Percy Harrison Fawcett. He wanted to make “the great discovery of the century” by finding the cryptic lost City of Z but instead, the uncaring Amazon rainforest consumed him, his son (Jack) and his son’s friend (Raleigh Rimell). So, “the great discovery of the century” became infamous as what has often been described as “the greatest exploration mystery of the twentieth century”— that is, the mystery of the fate of Percy Fawcett and the whereabouts of the lost City of Z.Many have tried to solve the mystery over the years, but failed.No one could find exactly what happened to Fawcett and certainly no one could find any clues that Z ever existed. But why should it exist? It was really pointless of us to assume right from the start that a civilization could prosper under something as brutal and vainglorious as Amazon. Sure, Grann did made some flimsy attempts by the end of the book by hinting that a civilized colony might have existed in the Amazon in the past, but that didn’t half-convince me.So, one thing I would definitely take away from this book is the fact that, Amazon is the bane of civilization."
95,0385513534,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5858699-kavita,4,"David Grann is a journalist, who got fascinated with the legend of Percy Fawcett, the Amazon explorer who disappeared into the Amazon in 1925, along with his son and his son's friend. Fawcett's obsession with an ancient and highly complex civilisation within the Amazon rainforest forms the basis of this book. Grann sets out to prove that Fawcett was right, and makes a journey into the Amazon himself.The Lost City of Z is basically a biography of Fawcett and concentrates on his quest for the legendary city that he called Z. I originally assumed that it was Grann's own journey into the Amazon which would be described here. There were short chapters in which he got ready to enter the forest, and since the story was not about it, it all turned out to be superficial. It would have been much better if Grann had concentrated solely on the Fawcett story.Interestingly, Grann quotes from the writings of Spanish conquistadors who had travelled the Amazon in the 1500s. Their descriptions varied from those of Fawcett, because by then, the local tribes had been wiped out massively and the region deforested. Grann's own journey showed yet more deforestation and extinction of life since the 1900s. Sadly, a few hundred years down the line, we might not have an Amazon rainforest left despite its vastness, so these accounts are valuable. The real appeal of the book, of course, lies in the fact that you can enjoy the deadly rainforest from the comfort of your couch. Not for us the risking of our lives and confronting snakes, mosquitoes, and other creatures of the rainforest, not to mention battling disease, hunger, and thirst. For us, the delight of expertly sliding into a beautiful world you can romanticise without really having to move a muscle. The Inferno Verde can become a Paraíso Verde."

I am hoping that it will qualify for a Bingo square - name of a city in the title ""Lost City of Z"". David Grann is a reporter and states at the beginning of the book that he isn't the type to get involved in the stories he works on and researches. Once he finishes a story he moves on to the next one. But like other adventurers, David did get caught up in the ""greatest exploration mystery of the twentieth century"" and set out to solve the story about the disappearance of British explorer Perry Faucett, and his son in the Amazon. What happened to them while they were searching for the Lost City of Z? This is a very informative and interesting non-fiction book that reads much like an Indiana Jones adventure story. David Grann expertly weaves geography, history and science together resulting in a breath-taking narrative. I listened to the audiobook of this story narrated by the talented Mark Deakins. He is one of my favourite narrators because he uses different voices for each character, and the voices seem to fit the character -bringing the story ""alive"". (I have read over 160 audio books and feel this audiobook enhanced my experience reading this book.

98,0385513534,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2370826-dave-cullen,5,"Brilliant. This is a new classic of the narrative nonfiction genre.The prose is vivid and intoxicating, and he weaves together 2+ threads, seamlessly--with the Fawcett thread dominant, as it should be, yet given fresh life with the mingling of the contemporary thread.I was drawn in from the start, but oddly enough, I REALLY got fascinated when he got to the developing field of cultural anthropology, and the fights over whether the people in the Amazon were ""noble savages"" or just ""savages,"" or stupid subhumans, or . . . and what the apparent tiny population really meant. Throughout the book, there was an adventure story going on, but a much wider, deeper consideration of how the discoveries there fundamentally altered our conceptions of how and why we all are the way we are. And it crept into those ideas artfully, interestingly and never pedantically. It never bogged down into a university course: felt more like an exciting speaker spurring our curiosity and helping us run with it.So well done. I'll use this as one of my models for all my future books.(And as a writer, I can't resist saying: Great verbs! I mean, stupendously great, every page, every paragraph. Never too much, consistently just right.)"

In fact, I remember clearly that I didn't want to see it. The name sounded silly, and I had no clue what it was about. Visions of pirates and space creatures clouded my judgment. Luckily, my friends dragged me in by majority vote and I emerged from the theater two hours later, exhilarated, endlessly curious about early human cultures, and determined to live a more exciting life. And it stuck. Years later, I stood in the middle of Albuquerque receiving my degree in Anthropology, still consumed with a passion for learning about ancient human history and lost worlds. Percy Fawcett, the adventurer, explorer, and land surveyor at the heart of ""The Lost City of Z"" would have most likely seen a lot of himself in Indiana Jones. If ever there were a real-life version of the intrepid anthropologist, Fawcett would definitely be a frontrunner. And fate seemed to lead him there. In his early military years in Ceylon, Fawcett heard the legend of a lost city buried beneath an earthen mound near his base. He took it upon himself to try to locate this lost world, and appears to have had some success, although he did not have the wherewithal at the time to excavate it. Still, the thrill of the find and the desire to pursue other ""lost worlds"" grabbed hold of him then, and planted the seed of obsession that would follow him throughout the rest of his life. Working for the Royal Geographical Society, Fawcett was sent to the largely uncharted and dangerous forests of the Amazon. By many accounts, there seems to be no crueler environment in the world. When I was once contemplating graduate field work, I recalled the stories of an anthropologist who had visited our class to tell us about his work with the Yanamami, a tribe so fascinating and remote that many classmates later expressed their desire to do the same. But me? Not in the least. I knew the last place on earth I ever wanted to live - even for a short time - was within the bug-infested, snake-laden, vampire-bat heavy jaguar lair that is the Amazon. Mosquitoes love me here in New England. Imagine the feast I would provide them in the rain forest. I would be nearly bloodless in a week. But Fawcett, he was made for the place. Surveying the formerly unexplored (by white men) border between Brazil and Bolivia, he accomplished his mission nearly a year ahead of schedule. This despite losing half his team to disease, the arrows of hostile tribes, parasitic worms, viral infections, and starvation. By all accounts, Fawcett was impervious to disease, boasting a hardy constitution unphased by the rigors of a jungle so dense that a day's worth of hacking through it with machetes sometimes only gained the team a half a mile of advancement. His amazing physical stamina and seeming disdain for the suffering of others bred one of two things in the men who served him: intense loyalty or mutinous desire. The tales of both of these conditions in his many journeys back into the jungle after his acclaimed first mission, are the stuff of legend. But, somewhere along the way, Fawcett began to hear about a Lost City, much like the famed El Dorado, a city of vast palaces and towering pillars, filled with riches and covered in gold dust. Having encountered a smaller version of this phenomenon in Ceylon, Fawcett became intrigued. As time went on, intrigue turned to obsession, as more and more of the oral histories he encountered in the tribes he befriended, as well as the geographical and archaeological record that had newly been discovered began to substantiate the claims. When Hiram Bingham discovered Machu Picchu during the same time period as Fawcett's work, it only fueled his desire to find his own ""lost world."" ""The Lost City of Z"" is brilliantly told and exhaustively researched by David Grann. Needless to say, Fawcett's final mission involved a last ditch effort to find the city, taking only his grown son, his son's best friend and a couple of temporary native guides. They went into the forest in 1925 and were never heard from again. Since that time, literally hundreds of amateur explorers have trekked into the same hostile jungles to try to find the missing Colonel and his companions. As recently as 1995, a Bolivian businessman and his grown son (along with an expert team and the best technological aids) tried to finally find out what happened to the Fawcett team all those years ago, only to find themselves taken captive by an Amazonian tribe. (The tribe debated whether or not to kill them for three days until finally releasing them in exchange for their thirty thousand dollars worth of equipment.) And this was 1995 - not 1925. It is no wonder that Grann himself finally feels compelled to witness the land where Percy Fawcett was lost forever. His journey, which he documents late in the book, is far more eventful than I would have imagined, and his final meeting with the anthropologist Michael Hecklenberger, who has lived in the Amazon for over a dozen years now, was insightful and educational. For anyone who has ever felt the pull of exploration, imagined the thrill of a lost world, or even just really enjoyed the exploits of Indiana Jones, pick up this fascinating book. I doubt it will make you want to trek through the Amazon, (in fact, it may dissuade you from going to a jungle anywhere, ever, under any circumstances), but it might just make you want to explore a new culture, visit a museum, or even just take the long way home. And if it does, Percy Fawcett may have succeeded in some small way."
101,0385513534,http://goodreads.com/user/show/798978-barbara,5,"The story of ""Colonel"" Fawcett, and his explorations of the Amazon were once world known. Fawcett was searching for a legendary city in the jungle. He began his explorations in the 19th century. In the Victorian Age exploration was done by amateurs, and the field of anthropology was in its infancy. Fawcett's trips were financed by the Royal Geographic Society in London. Fawcett was relentless, driving his family into bankruptcy. On his final trip in 1925, he and his son, and a third man, disappeared.The descriptions of the explorations were hair raising. The insects were not only pests but dangerous. I won't go into detail but their effect on humans are disgusting. There was also danger from some the the warlike tribes, who as recently as the 1990's killed outsiders who wandered into their territory.The author Grann decides to investigate Fawcett and the ""lost city"". This book is mostly a report of Fawcett's life, and expeditions. He was famous not only for his numerous journeys, but his ability to form friendships with Amazon Indians, and his appreciation of their way of life. Grann himself travels to Brazil over a 100 years after Fawcett disappeared. This is a fascinating account, and one I found hard to put down."
102,0385513534,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1605591-christine,5,"	Shortly after I finished this book, the BBC World Service reported that a Brazilian man who advocated for small farmers, natives, and the rain forest was murdered. He was shot five times in the head while biking with his wife. The same report made reference to the 2005 killing of an American nun, a murder that Grann mentions in his book. What the news report drove home was the idea that the Amazon is still a dangerous place, just not exactly in the same way it was during Fawcett’s time. Instead of worrying about how a misunderstanding with a native tribe could end in the death of tribal members or of the group of explorers, the battle is now between business and various types of conversation. In many ways, a more violent battle, not just because everyone has guns.	This idea is not wholly examined in The Lost City of Z, though David Grann does touch on it in the closing chapters of his book, and the idea of the destruction of the natural world does run though a good portion of the book.	Much of the book is about Fawcett and his various trips to the Amazon; culminating in what was undoubtedly a fatal trip to find a “lost” city that he had named Z.	In fact, if you are going to learn anything from this book (and you are), the most important is the simple fact that if the natives tell you not to do something or go somewhere, LISTEN TO THEM! THEY KNOW FROM WHENCE THEY SPEAK!	(I’m using the slightly political incorrect term of natives because I am a good American who has been taught that Indian refers to a person from India. South American Native Americans is way too wordy, there too many tribes to list all the tribe names, and the term Native American or First People [nations:] would make me sound like the news anchor on CNN who referred to the African immigrants protesting/rioting in Paris a few years back as African-Americans.)	Fawcett was a man who spent more time in the Amazon then with his family. As an aside, Grann does a wonderful job of showing the strength of character of both Nina Fawcett and Grann’s own wife, making both women sound just as, if not more, heroic than their husbands. In fact, Mr. Grann, your wife sounds far more intelligent than you. (Sorry, don’t mean to offend, but she knew you needed more than sneakers before heading into the Amazon). The men who explored the Amazon seemed to have married very understand and supportive women (and, if possible, very rich women). While her husband was dealing with nasty bugs and a fish that could swim up his wee-wee, Nina Fawcett was giving birth to their second child, raising their first (eventually raising all three children), keeping house, and protecting her husband’s reputation, all of this on a rather limited budget.	To be far, Fawcett seemed to know that he was unworthy of her. This is what makes the book charming. It’s warts and all, and the people who have warts, know they have them. It’s very human.	Fawcett became convinced that there was lost civilization in the Amazon, basically a version of the city of gold myth. It was during an attempt to find this city that Fawcett, his eldest son Jack, and his son’s closest friend disappeared in the Amazon. The disappearance set off searches, rescue missions, and theories (such as this book), possibly resulting in another 100 deaths/disappearances.	Grann seems aware of his obsession and the risks it brings to both himself and his family. In fact, it seems like this is going to be his only big adventure. It seems he learned a lesson that Fawcett didn’t or couldn’t learn.	In some ways, the most interesting part of the book is the closing chapter which describes what a lost civilization in the Amazon is truly. Think the Incas, the Mayans, the Aztecs but in a different country. If the rain forest is turned wholly over to big business, if its defenders and supporters are murdered then not only do the flora and fauna of the Amazon disappear, not only do tribal cultures (if not whole tribes) die, but the Lost City of Z will still forever be lost."

While not really giving any sort of definitive answer to what happened to Percy Fawcett on his last expedition, the book was a wonderfully researched book on turn of the century amateur exploration and the competition that ensued between these gentleman rivals.While the final discovery was a great vindication of those explorers who felt that there had to be some sort of great civilization in the Amazon region, we are still not sure that Z has been or ever will be found.Nonetheless, this is one journey that I was happy to make with the author and am amazed at the treasure trove of new information he was able to provide everyone."

HOWEVER, I was pleasantly surprised that the book also gave me a sense of early 20th popular culture. I walked away with a new perspective on the environment that produced stories like The Lost World and At the Mountains of Madness. Also, I have scratched the deep amazon off my list of places to go hiking."

106,0385513534,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35799-amy,4,"Colonel Percy Harrison Fawcett was quite a famous explorer in his day. The last of the ""great Victorian explorers"", he inspired the creation of Indiana Jones (and quite possibly Commander McBragg). He was as well known at the time as Dr. Livingstone, and had a reputation of being indestructible. He became obsessed with El Dorado, the mythical (?) city of gold, which he also referred to as Z. In 1925, he took his oldest son and one of his son's friends on an expedition into the jungles of Brazil to find it. They were never seen again outside of the Amazon. Over the course of the next decades, dozens of expeditions set out to find the Fawcett party, or traces of it, including other famous explorers of the time, an actor who had played an explorer (!), and Fawcett's younger son Brian. Some of them were also lost. In addition, many people died just looking for El Dorado. More modern science concluded that no complex civilization could have endured in the Amazon, in so hostile an environment.This book tells the story of Fawcett and traces this final expedition. The author even traveled to Brazil himself to try to follow Fawcett's last trail and try to find out what exactly happened to him. (When he reached one point where Fawcett had been in the jungle, he said that it looked ""like Nebraska"" now - deforestation is real.) Using Fawcett's private notes from previous trips that the family shared with him, as well as dispatches from his final one, Grann was able to find the spot where he thought they had started from (Fawcett had said one thing in his public notes for the Royal Geographic Society, to keep the exact location confidential because other explorers were out there looking. But Grann found another set of coordinates in Fawcett's private notes).I don't know anything about this man or his expeditions, but it seems to me that Grann has helped answer some of the questions that surrounded him. And maybe the Amazon isn't as hostile to agriculture and society as previously thought?On the other hand.... it is pretty much just waiting to kill you so I don't recommend trying it."
107,0385513534,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1758594-patrick-gibson,4,"This author was on the Colbert show a few nights ago. Even though Steven wouldn’t give the poor guy a chance to talk, the story seemed right up my alley so I picked up the book the next day. Isn’t that why authors appear on talk shows, so that numb-nuts like me will rush to Borders?Percy Harrison Fawcett was the real-life explorer whose adventures Arthur Conan Doyle drew upon for his 1912 novel ‘The Lost Word.’ While Fawcett did not find a South American plateau populated with dinosaurs, he did lead numerous expeditions looking for lost civilizations. On his last and most ambitious—seeking the City of Z—he vanished. Over the past seventy-five years there have been hundreds of other expeditions into the Amazon, by a myriad of adventurers, looking for Percy Fawcett. All failed. Hundreds died. Many were never heard from again.Fawcett marked the end of an age. He was the last of the individualist explores. The day of the airplane, the radio, the organized and heavily financed modern expedition had not arrived. With him, it was the heroic story of a man against a vast uncharted wilderness nearly the size of the continental United States inhabited by deadly warriors.Armed with newly discovered information found in a trunk by one of Fawcett’s grandchildren the author, after completing exhaustive research, decides to enter the Amazon and follow the path of Fawcett’s last journey. This is a little eye-brow lifting because the author is a middle aged slightly chunky New Yorker who is the complete opposite of the rigorously trained, physically fit, handsome Fawcett. Thus the consequence of obsession, I guess.Throughout the nineteenth century there was a tremendous speculation concerning the ‘lesser’ civilizations and their inability to reach a level of sophistication beyond living in huts and foraging for food. Darwin did nothing to dispel this attitude—in fact, augmented it. Fawcett was unique in his vision and belief that remote jungle societies could indeed build out of stone, decipher the movements of the stars and create a written language. Without any concrete knowledge of its existence, he was determined to find proof, in the form of a magnificent stone city—he called Z—in the blank parts of the Amazon maps.For Fawcett’s final, and according to him ‘definitive’ 1925 excursion, instead of a group of hunter/explorers, he took only his twenty-one year old son Jack, and Jack’s companion Raleigh Rimell (who really wanted to go to Hollywood and become a silent movie star). For a while the trio sent native runners out of the jungle with progress reports. Their messages would be telegraphed to cities in the United States and eventually newspapers around the world published accounts of their progress. The world literally followed their escapades like a serial novel. Then everything stopped. And the world went nuts. Every major geographical society mounted rescue parties. Finding Fawcett Fever lasted for years. Even in the 1950’s there were rumors Fawcett was still alive and lording like a king over a remote tribe. In the 1960’s, rescue parties were mounted and sent into the wilds. More people died searching for Fawcett than looking for the headwaters of the Nile or panning gold in the Pacific northwest. It’s a pretty amazing story and a whopping good read. The author knows how to pace his story and exactly the right time to intersperse details of his own trek though the tropical forest.I have always wondered about these curious lines from ‘Othello”:And of the Cannibals that each other eat,The Anthropophagi, and men whose headsDo grow beneath their shoulders.It comes from an idea Shakespeare borrowed from Sir Walter Raleigh writing about Francisco de Orellana, whose expedition into the Amazon vanished in 1542. One of the many Christian xenophobes who contributed to slavery in the Western hemisphere. (Raleigh, not Shakespeare.)The author doesn’t have an ending and the story looses its momentum towards the end, but it is an intriguing story, well researched and a very interesting read. Completely enjoyable."

That is, talking about sales forecasts, writing up spread sheets and cursing Excel when I couldn't copy/paste from one cell to another, and being encouraged to think of ways I could improve the company while knowing I could be laid off at any minute. All so common, and all such a snore. Now, even my exciting life in Italy is still tedious at times, albeit for different reasons.Then a book like this comes along to rip us out of the goddamn delirium of every day life. This is the true story of when men were men and the world was a place to be explored and conquered so that the blank places on maps could be filled in and the Queen could get a few more jewels in her crown. The ballsiest of all explorers, Percy Fawcett, thought that hiking through the Amazon in a search for the legendary city of El Dorado was a good way to spend his time. KICK ASS. And there's even more fun here: swarming mosquitoes that carry disease, small catfish that like to lodge themselves IN the anus or urethra and can only be removed by surgery, blood-sucking bats, disease, parasites, and Indians in the bush just waiting to shoot you with poison arrows and shrink your head, sell it to collectors, and have it turn up in a pawn shop in Vegas. WICKED!

Then the entries suddenly stopped and Fawcett was never heard from again. Expeditions were made to discover what happened to them; nothing was ever found, while some more people were lost to the Amazon. The Lost City of Z is the story of Percy Fawcett, his life and how he became a great explorer, and where his obsession for the Amazon came from. It is also the story of the mystery of this doomed last expedition, and all the efforts – some ending in tragedy – that have been made since then.David Grann is a staff writer for the New Yorker who first found out about Percy Fawcett while researching an article on the mysterious death of the world’s foremost Sherlock Holmes expert. The Lost City of Z takes Grann all over the world, from visiting Fawcett’s great granddaughter and seeing some of his original journal entries, to putting together his own expedition to find out what really happened to Percy Fawcett. The Lost City of Z is the incredible story of one of the last explorers, but it is also the story of the strength of the human spirit and it’s drive to never give up.

I liked the format with the biographical and historical information interspersed with the authors research in libraries and archives, and shopping trips to adventure outfitters. How had I never heard of the Fawcett mystery until now? It seems like a story ripe for Hollywood or various adventure stories, so it is a wonder that it took this long to have some quality research on the topic (or have I just been ignorant of this?) Interesting aside - as I was reading this, my husband is reading Candice Millard's *River of Doubt* about Roosevelt's travels in Amazon. It was intriguing to hear the Grann citing that book, and for my husband and I to discuss the two expeditions and how they differed. I look forward to reading that book soon to continue my own little obsession with rainforest adventure stories...This book describes a very different Amazon than the one I encountered on my trip to Peru in 2007 - of course, I was not in the deepest darkest part of the forest, but we were ""roughing it"" by a lot of standards... I guess that is because over the last century there have been significant strides in public health and sanitation, disease prevention, and research on tropical climes... even in the author's travels in 2006 and 2007, he describes a very different Brazilian rainforest than Fawcett encountered 80 years prior. This alone causes some concern that things can change so significantly in the relatively short span of years..."

Fawcett's British colonial background, his early years, other explorations, his family, his involvement in the Royal Geographical Society and the colonial and imperialist mix that was current in the late 19th and early 20th century in England ... it's all filler.Finally, finally, FINALLY the author takes the reader on his recent journey to the same area where Fawcett was last reported. The upshot is still that no one knows what happened, despite numerous attempts by numerous people to find out. The book ends with a short description of recent archaeological discoveries in the region that have uncovered much larger population centers and could have given rise to stories about an El Dorado or Z.That's it. The book could have been condensed into 50 pages and told exactly the same story."

Legend has it Fawcett was killed or captured by hostile tribes, starved to death, or perhaps as some fringe groups believe he transcended mortality when he found and entered the lost city of Z.

Along with that, the descriptions in the book are sometimes more than I would have liked, whether it be about bodies, diseases, deaths, etc. There were many bizarre religions mentioned, including the occult.The adventure Fawcett must have thrived on throughout his life was evident in this book, and it's what kept me reading when the story went on a tangent, which happened often. It would have been much easier to read if the author had chosen either his own experiences or Fawcett's to focus on throughout, as the jumps from one POV to the next were quite jarring most of the time.

In the course of his explorations Fawcett became obsessed with the idea of a lost civilization somewhere in the Amazon, a technologically and culturally advanced society hidden somewhere in the dense, impenetrable jungle. I'm not spoiling anything to let you know that Fawcett never found his city, which he mysteriously nicknamed ""Z,"" at 58 he took his 22 year old son and his son's best friend into the jungle determined to finally find it. The three men never returned and a legend was born.Over the years hundreds of would be rescuers and explorers have attempted to learn the fate of the last Fawcett expedition and/or discover Fawcett's fabled city.Grann joins their ranks and determines to journey there himself, leaving a wife and newborn son in New York City, to try to find the truth.There are two perfectly blended journey's here. Grann takes a ""no apologies"" approach in his exploration of Fawcett's life. We meet the tireless, obsessed explorer, negligent father and husband and the aggressive, easily offended bully who called anyone who couldn't match his 10 mile treks through unexplored jungle a ""coward."" Fawcett was certainly a thoroughly unlikable person but, as Grann takes pains to point out, its impossible to ignore his strength, dedication and intelligence. He changed the more time he spent in the Amazon among the tribes that lived there. He came to question the Victorian ""make the world England"" approach that was playing the same role the Spanish had years earlier in killing, subjugating and erasing the people who had thrived there for a thousand years. He fought bitterly against his own nature and that of his country to argue that ""savage"" was an abhorrent term perhaps best used to describe those attempting to ""civilize"" a people far beyond them already.Then we have Grann who through his own journey to the Amazon comes to understand that for all Fawcett's successes he lost site of those closest to him, those who needed him and depended upon him. He realizes that he too has become so blind to everything but this quest that he's abandoned his own family without a second thought.So yes, this is a book about crazy amazing adventures and secrets in the jungle and its amazingly exciting and so much fun to listen to at night right before bed. It really is like Indiana Jones comes to life (hell there's apparently an Indiana Jones novel ABOUT Fawcett and his city) but its also about what we lose when we put dreams ahead of everything else. Subtle and heart stopping. A nice combo it turns out."
116,0385513534,http://goodreads.com/user/show/83144-el,4,"I love a good yarn. I love those crazy stories about hidden treasures, travels to the ends of the earth, and driving obsessions - the more real they are, the better.In the Twenties, explorer Percy Fawcett wandered into the jungles of the Amazon to find the Lost City of Z, aka the ancient civilization, El Dorado. He was obsessed with the concept of this hidden civilization, and spent years researching and studying before embarking on his journey. But what happened? We know that most of his team died along the way, and that he sent his then 21-year-old son back home. But then the story ends basically, because Fawcett never made it out of the jungle. Was he driven to death by his own obsession? Was he eaten by a ginormous snake? Did he find the Lost City of Z and decide to just hang there for the rest of his days? David Grann picks up the story by not necessarily answering those questions, but by trying to follow in Fawcett's footsteps. Well... without that pesky ""getting-lost-in-the-Amazon-and-probably-dying"" thing.This is an engrossing story and totally fulfilled the wannabe archeologist I have inside, all the while reminding me that I would never last in the Amazon. It's hot, it's humid, there are bugs I've never even imagined (and I'm not being especially girly - I'm talking about mosquitoes that suck the juice off your eyeballs or those annoying things that basically get inside your junk and can not be removed), vampire bats, and did I mention the humidity? Yeah, it's not really a place that I could call home, but Fawcett apparently could, and Grann sure as heck could at least hang with the best of them. More power to those guys.Still, the bouncing back and forth between Grann's own expedition and that of Fawcett's was distracting at times. It would have been better if Grann just took one storyline and ran with it as they are singularly pretty fascinating. But Grann did a decent job of finding primary sources to back his (and Fawcett's) claims. My list of books to hunt down now has increased exponentially, and I suppose I can thank Grann for that, though I think it has more to do with the absolute craziness that possessed Fawcett that makes me want to know more about him."

It is amazing how many people had invested time, money and, in some cases, their lives to search for a group that people said shouldn't have gone in the first place. Maybe if those people had helped fund the expedition they wouldn't have gone missing. Or as some conspiracies say maybe he wanted to go missing.But there's a part of me that would have also wanted to rush out looking for him. And that's the part that believes in the lost city of Z. Not the city of gold or the gilded man but the ancient civilization of the Amazon. The people and cities the original European explorers reported that were never seen again. And which science and archaeologists are finally confirming as being real. I would love to join the digs in South America, maybe one day I will.So why only 4 stars? The book is too short. I know it was originally written as an article and then extended but it was over too quick. I was really getting into the story and the discoveries when it finished. Now I'll have to find more books on the subject."

Grann's descriptions of all the horrible ways the Amazon can invade the body make me never want to stand in a forest again. However, the book did end on a good note: in awe of the great unknown civilizations that not only survive but thrived in the Amazon. I also found Grann's portrayal of the individuals that journeyed into the Amazon (and the people they left behind) interesting enough in themselves. What kind of people are compelled again and again to enter into a lonely hell? "

120,0385513534,http://goodreads.com/user/show/869064-jeremy,3,"This is kind of an odd accomplishment: an adventure book that will make you really really glad your not an adventurer. Grann's descriptions of Fawcett et al trampling through the amazonian rainforest with their crass, (often racist) imperialist delusions of grandeur and discovery are often gut-wrenching. Skin peels off in sheets, everyone gets malaria, parasites, maggot infections (shudder), gangrene, etc. Trekking through unspoiled tropical jungles is utterly horrifying, you basically just turn yourself into an oozing, walking meal and wait for the rainforest to literally devour you. Grann remains fairly non-judgmental through out. After all, it's the green hell of the jungle itself which finally breaks down and destroys hubris and good intentions alike. Seriously, some of this stuff would make Werner Herzog blush."

For most of the book I thought Percy Fawcett (the explorer whom the book is about) was probably a complete wack-a-doodle. At the end of the book, maybe only partially a wack-a-doodle but you do have to be somewhat obsessed to keep going back into that environment looking for a fabled ""Lost City"". I cannot fathom trekking into the Amazon jungle in our times with modern technology let alone in the 1920's when Fawcett did it. It is not a place I would ever desire to experience, just on the bug issue alone! Gross stuff in there!! The book is a bit long in places but overall pretty good.(Why is GR marking everything as read twice when it's only been read once?). Maddening!"

The author also has a new non-fiction book to be published in April, 2017: Killers of the Flower Moon. My original review:: ""This is a very readable, well researched book. It focuses on explorer Colonel Percy Fawcett, and his obsession to find a great. ancient city deep in the Amazon jungle which he called Z. Z ,if it existed, may have given rise to the legend of El Dorado. The book tells the story of Fawcett's quests, and of the author attempting to journey to the Amazon to try to solve some of the mystery around Fawcett's mysterious disappearance on his 1925 expedition.  Anyone interested in early 20th century exploration and past and present day Amazonia should enjoy this book. Prior to his ill-fated journey, Fawcett had explored the Amazon several times before. He was an arrogant man, rarely getting along with those who accompanied him on his journeys. He seemed immune to most tropical illnesses and scorned those who became ill or couldn't keep up to his break-neck pace, regarding them as weak. His obsession to find Z bordered on madness as he consulted spiritualists. The author found that his papers showed ever increasing bizarre beliefs. For his last journey he advertised for strong men to accompany him (no women allowed). A large number of scientists, explorers, athletes and people wanting adventure or just wishing to get just away from home replied. Among those turned down was Lawrence of Arabia . Fawcett felt that a person used to the desert would never keep up to him in the jungle. Instead he decided to go accompanied by his 21 year old son and the son's best friend.  As Fawcett was very secretive, not wanting any rival explorer to find Z before he did, his exact route was unknown or sometimes written in code. The disappearance of Fawcett and the two young men caused a sensation, and countless people also vanished or died searching for them.It also tells the stories of other explorers in the early part half of the 1800's. These adventurers have now been replaced by archaeologists and anthropologists. Grann discovers in his journey a ruins which may have led to the legend of Z which is now being studied and excavated, and he believes he knows the fate of Fawcett and the two young men from stories passed on by several Indian tribes."""
124,0385513534,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6969151-veeral,4,"That obnoxious Amazon. It likes to monopolize and dominate the jungle. Although one might be led to believe that there would be an abundance of everything where such a mighty force exists, the truth is exactly the opposite. As David Grann puts it himself: It’s the great “counterfeit paradise”. I couldn’t agree more. Amazon will starve you. Amazon will desiccate you. And finally, Amazon will obliterate you. Because, simply put, Amazon doesn’t care for you. It’s a green desert. Unfit for human civilization.Take the example of Colonel Percy Harrison Fawcett. He wanted to make “the great discovery of the century” by finding the cryptic lost City of Z but instead, the uncaring Amazon rainforest consumed him, his son (Jack) and his son’s friend (Raleigh Rimell). So, “the great discovery of the century” became infamous as what has often been described as “the greatest exploration mystery of the twentieth century”— that is, the mystery of the fate of Percy Fawcett and the whereabouts of the lost City of Z.Many have tried to solve the mystery over the years, but failed.No one could find exactly what happened to Fawcett and certainly no one could find any clues that Z ever existed. But why should it exist? It was really pointless of us to assume right from the start that a civilization could prosper under something as brutal and vainglorious as Amazon. Sure, Grann did made some flimsy attempts by the end of the book by hinting that a civilized colony might have existed in the Amazon in the past, but that didn’t half-convince me.So, one thing I would definitely take away from this book is the fact that, Amazon is the bane of civilization."
125,0385513534,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5858699-kavita,4,"David Grann is a journalist, who got fascinated with the legend of Percy Fawcett, the Amazon explorer who disappeared into the Amazon in 1925, along with his son and his son's friend. Fawcett's obsession with an ancient and highly complex civilisation within the Amazon rainforest forms the basis of this book. Grann sets out to prove that Fawcett was right, and makes a journey into the Amazon himself.The Lost City of Z is basically a biography of Fawcett and concentrates on his quest for the legendary city that he called Z. I originally assumed that it was Grann's own journey into the Amazon which would be described here. There were short chapters in which he got ready to enter the forest, and since the story was not about it, it all turned out to be superficial. It would have been much better if Grann had concentrated solely on the Fawcett story.Interestingly, Grann quotes from the writings of Spanish conquistadors who had travelled the Amazon in the 1500s. Their descriptions varied from those of Fawcett, because by then, the local tribes had been wiped out massively and the region deforested. Grann's own journey showed yet more deforestation and extinction of life since the 1900s. Sadly, a few hundred years down the line, we might not have an Amazon rainforest left despite its vastness, so these accounts are valuable. The real appeal of the book, of course, lies in the fact that you can enjoy the deadly rainforest from the comfort of your couch. Not for us the risking of our lives and confronting snakes, mosquitoes, and other creatures of the rainforest, not to mention battling disease, hunger, and thirst. For us, the delight of expertly sliding into a beautiful world you can romanticise without really having to move a muscle. The Inferno Verde can become a Paraíso Verde."
126,0385513534,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39134508-kathleen,4,"This book was chosen by my book club as the non-fiction book for the month. I am hoping that it will qualify for a Bingo square - name of a city in the title ""Lost City of Z"". David Grann is a reporter and states at the beginning of the book that he isn't the type to get involved in the stories he works on and researches. Once he finishes a story he moves on to the next one. But like other adventurers, David did get caught up in the ""greatest exploration mystery of the twentieth century"" and set out to solve the story about the disappearance of British explorer Perry Faucett, and his son in the Amazon. What happened to them while they were searching for the Lost City of Z? This is a very informative and interesting non-fiction book that reads much like an Indiana Jones adventure story. David Grann expertly weaves geography, history and science together resulting in a breath-taking narrative. I listened to the audiobook of this story narrated by the talented Mark Deakins. He is one of my favourite narrators because he uses different voices for each character, and the voices seem to fit the character -bringing the story ""alive"". (I have read over 160 audio books and feel this audiobook enhanced my experience reading this book. If you are new to audio books, I think you should opt for reading this in print.)I highly recommend this non-fiction book for readers interested in history, explorations, and the Amazon."

This is a new classic of the narrative nonfiction genre.The prose is vivid and intoxicating, and he weaves together 2+ threads, seamlessly--with the Fawcett thread dominant, as it should be, yet given fresh life with the mingling of the contemporary thread.I was drawn in from the start, but oddly enough, I REALLY got fascinated when he got to the developing field of cultural anthropology, and the fights over whether the people in the Amazon were ""noble savages"" or just ""savages,"" or stupid subhumans, or . . . and what the apparent tiny population really meant. Throughout the book, there was an adventure story going on, but a much wider, deeper consideration of how the discoveries there fundamentally altered our conceptions of how and why we all are the way we are. And it crept into those ideas artfully, interestingly and never pedantically. It never bogged down into a university course: felt more like an exciting speaker spurring our curiosity and helping us run with it.So well done. I'll use this as one of my models for all my future books.(And as a writer, I can't resist saying: Great verbs! I mean, stupendously great, every page, every paragraph. Never too much, consistently just right.)"

In fact, I remember clearly that I didn't want to see it. The name sounded silly, and I had no clue what it was about. Visions of pirates and space creatures clouded my judgment. Luckily, my friends dragged me in by majority vote and I emerged from the theater two hours later, exhilarated, endlessly curious about early human cultures, and determined to live a more exciting life. And it stuck. Years later, I stood in the middle of Albuquerque receiving my degree in Anthropology, still consumed with a passion for learning about ancient human history and lost worlds. Percy Fawcett, the adventurer, explorer, and land surveyor at the heart of ""The Lost City of Z"" would have most likely seen a lot of himself in Indiana Jones. If ever there were a real-life version of the intrepid anthropologist, Fawcett would definitely be a frontrunner. And fate seemed to lead him there. In his early military years in Ceylon, Fawcett heard the legend of a lost city buried beneath an earthen mound near his base. He took it upon himself to try to locate this lost world, and appears to have had some success, although he did not have the wherewithal at the time to excavate it. Still, the thrill of the find and the desire to pursue other ""lost worlds"" grabbed hold of him then, and planted the seed of obsession that would follow him throughout the rest of his life. Working for the Royal Geographical Society, Fawcett was sent to the largely uncharted and dangerous forests of the Amazon. By many accounts, there seems to be no crueler environment in the world. When I was once contemplating graduate field work, I recalled the stories of an anthropologist who had visited our class to tell us about his work with the Yanamami, a tribe so fascinating and remote that many classmates later expressed their desire to do the same. But me? Not in the least. I knew the last place on earth I ever wanted to live - even for a short time - was within the bug-infested, snake-laden, vampire-bat heavy jaguar lair that is the Amazon. Mosquitoes love me here in New England. Imagine the feast I would provide them in the rain forest. I would be nearly bloodless in a week. But Fawcett, he was made for the place. Surveying the formerly unexplored (by white men) border between Brazil and Bolivia, he accomplished his mission nearly a year ahead of schedule. This despite losing half his team to disease, the arrows of hostile tribes, parasitic worms, viral infections, and starvation. By all accounts, Fawcett was impervious to disease, boasting a hardy constitution unphased by the rigors of a jungle so dense that a day's worth of hacking through it with machetes sometimes only gained the team a half a mile of advancement. His amazing physical stamina and seeming disdain for the suffering of others bred one of two things in the men who served him: intense loyalty or mutinous desire. The tales of both of these conditions in his many journeys back into the jungle after his acclaimed first mission, are the stuff of legend. But, somewhere along the way, Fawcett began to hear about a Lost City, much like the famed El Dorado, a city of vast palaces and towering pillars, filled with riches and covered in gold dust. Having encountered a smaller version of this phenomenon in Ceylon, Fawcett became intrigued. As time went on, intrigue turned to obsession, as more and more of the oral histories he encountered in the tribes he befriended, as well as the geographical and archaeological record that had newly been discovered began to substantiate the claims. When Hiram Bingham discovered Machu Picchu during the same time period as Fawcett's work, it only fueled his desire to find his own ""lost world."" ""The Lost City of Z"" is brilliantly told and exhaustively researched by David Grann. Needless to say, Fawcett's final mission involved a last ditch effort to find the city, taking only his grown son, his son's best friend and a couple of temporary native guides. They went into the forest in 1925 and were never heard from again. Since that time, literally hundreds of amateur explorers have trekked into the same hostile jungles to try to find the missing Colonel and his companions. As recently as 1995, a Bolivian businessman and his grown son (along with an expert team and the best technological aids) tried to finally find out what happened to the Fawcett team all those years ago, only to find themselves taken captive by an Amazonian tribe. (The tribe debated whether or not to kill them for three days until finally releasing them in exchange for their thirty thousand dollars worth of equipment.) And this was 1995 - not 1925. It is no wonder that Grann himself finally feels compelled to witness the land where Percy Fawcett was lost forever. His journey, which he documents late in the book, is far more eventful than I would have imagined, and his final meeting with the anthropologist Michael Hecklenberger, who has lived in the Amazon for over a dozen years now, was insightful and educational. For anyone who has ever felt the pull of exploration, imagined the thrill of a lost world, or even just really enjoyed the exploits of Indiana Jones, pick up this fascinating book. I doubt it will make you want to trek through the Amazon, (in fact, it may dissuade you from going to a jungle anywhere, ever, under any circumstances), but it might just make you want to explore a new culture, visit a museum, or even just take the long way home. And if it does, Percy Fawcett may have succeeded in some small way."
131,0385513534,http://goodreads.com/user/show/798978-barbara,5,"The story of ""Colonel"" Fawcett, and his explorations of the Amazon were once world known. Fawcett was searching for a legendary city in the jungle. He began his explorations in the 19th century. In the Victorian Age exploration was done by amateurs, and the field of anthropology was in its infancy. Fawcett's trips were financed by the Royal Geographic Society in London. Fawcett was relentless, driving his family into bankruptcy. On his final trip in 1925, he and his son, and a third man, disappeared.The descriptions of the explorations were hair raising. The insects were not only pests but dangerous. I won't go into detail but their effect on humans are disgusting. There was also danger from some the the warlike tribes, who as recently as the 1990's killed outsiders who wandered into their territory.The author Grann decides to investigate Fawcett and the ""lost city"". This book is mostly a report of Fawcett's life, and expeditions. He was famous not only for his numerous journeys, but his ability to form friendships with Amazon Indians, and his appreciation of their way of life. Grann himself travels to Brazil over a 100 years after Fawcett disappeared. This is a fascinating account, and one I found hard to put down."
132,0385513534,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1605591-christine,5,"	Shortly after I finished this book, the BBC World Service reported that a Brazilian man who advocated for small farmers, natives, and the rain forest was murdered. He was shot five times in the head while biking with his wife. The same report made reference to the 2005 killing of an American nun, a murder that Grann mentions in his book. What the news report drove home was the idea that the Amazon is still a dangerous place, just not exactly in the same way it was during Fawcett’s time. Instead of worrying about how a misunderstanding with a native tribe could end in the death of tribal members or of the group of explorers, the battle is now between business and various types of conversation. In many ways, a more violent battle, not just because everyone has guns.	This idea is not wholly examined in The Lost City of Z, though David Grann does touch on it in the closing chapters of his book, and the idea of the destruction of the natural world does run though a good portion of the book.	Much of the book is about Fawcett and his various trips to the Amazon; culminating in what was undoubtedly a fatal trip to find a “lost” city that he had named Z.	In fact, if you are going to learn anything from this book (and you are), the most important is the simple fact that if the natives tell you not to do something or go somewhere, LISTEN TO THEM! THEY KNOW FROM WHENCE THEY SPEAK!	(I’m using the slightly political incorrect term of natives because I am a good American who has been taught that Indian refers to a person from India. South American Native Americans is way too wordy, there too many tribes to list all the tribe names, and the term Native American or First People [nations:] would make me sound like the news anchor on CNN who referred to the African immigrants protesting/rioting in Paris a few years back as African-Americans.)	Fawcett was a man who spent more time in the Amazon then with his family. As an aside, Grann does a wonderful job of showing the strength of character of both Nina Fawcett and Grann’s own wife, making both women sound just as, if not more, heroic than their husbands. In fact, Mr. Grann, your wife sounds far more intelligent than you. (Sorry, don’t mean to offend, but she knew you needed more than sneakers before heading into the Amazon). The men who explored the Amazon seemed to have married very understand and supportive women (and, if possible, very rich women). While her husband was dealing with nasty bugs and a fish that could swim up his wee-wee, Nina Fawcett was giving birth to their second child, raising their first (eventually raising all three children), keeping house, and protecting her husband’s reputation, all of this on a rather limited budget.	To be far, Fawcett seemed to know that he was unworthy of her. This is what makes the book charming. It’s warts and all, and the people who have warts, know they have them. It’s very human.	Fawcett became convinced that there was lost civilization in the Amazon, basically a version of the city of gold myth. It was during an attempt to find this city that Fawcett, his eldest son Jack, and his son’s closest friend disappeared in the Amazon. The disappearance set off searches, rescue missions, and theories (such as this book), possibly resulting in another 100 deaths/disappearances.	Grann seems aware of his obsession and the risks it brings to both himself and his family. In fact, it seems like this is going to be his only big adventure. It seems he learned a lesson that Fawcett didn’t or couldn’t learn.	In some ways, the most interesting part of the book is the closing chapter which describes what a lost civilization in the Amazon is truly. Think the Incas, the Mayans, the Aztecs but in a different country. If the rain forest is turned wholly over to big business, if its defenders and supporters are murdered then not only do the flora and fauna of the Amazon disappear, not only do tribal cultures (if not whole tribes) die, but the Lost City of Z will still forever be lost."

While not really giving any sort of definitive answer to what happened to Percy Fawcett on his last expedition, the book was a wonderfully researched book on turn of the century amateur exploration and the competition that ensued between these gentleman rivals.While the final discovery was a great vindication of those explorers who felt that there had to be some sort of great civilization in the Amazon region, we are still not sure that Z has been or ever will be found.Nonetheless, this is one journey that I was happy to make with the author and am amazed at the treasure trove of new information he was able to provide everyone."

136,0385513534,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35799-amy,4,"Colonel Percy Harrison Fawcett was quite a famous explorer in his day. The last of the ""great Victorian explorers"", he inspired the creation of Indiana Jones (and quite possibly Commander McBragg). He was as well known at the time as Dr. Livingstone, and had a reputation of being indestructible. He became obsessed with El Dorado, the mythical (?) city of gold, which he also referred to as Z. In 1925, he took his oldest son and one of his son's friends on an expedition into the jungles of Brazil to find it. They were never seen again outside of the Amazon. Over the course of the next decades, dozens of expeditions set out to find the Fawcett party, or traces of it, including other famous explorers of the time, an actor who had played an explorer (!), and Fawcett's younger son Brian. Some of them were also lost. In addition, many people died just looking for El Dorado. More modern science concluded that no complex civilization could have endured in the Amazon, in so hostile an environment.This book tells the story of Fawcett and traces this final expedition. The author even traveled to Brazil himself to try to follow Fawcett's last trail and try to find out what exactly happened to him. (When he reached one point where Fawcett had been in the jungle, he said that it looked ""like Nebraska"" now - deforestation is real.) Using Fawcett's private notes from previous trips that the family shared with him, as well as dispatches from his final one, Grann was able to find the spot where he thought they had started from (Fawcett had said one thing in his public notes for the Royal Geographic Society, to keep the exact location confidential because other explorers were out there looking. But Grann found another set of coordinates in Fawcett's private notes).I don't know anything about this man or his expeditions, but it seems to me that Grann has helped answer some of the questions that surrounded him. And maybe the Amazon isn't as hostile to agriculture and society as previously thought?On the other hand.... it is pretty much just waiting to kill you so I don't recommend trying it."

Even though Steven wouldn’t give the poor guy a chance to talk, the story seemed right up my alley so I picked up the book the next day. Isn’t that why authors appear on talk shows, so that numb-nuts like me will rush to Borders?Percy Harrison Fawcett was the real-life explorer whose adventures Arthur Conan Doyle drew upon for his 1912 novel ‘The Lost Word.’ While Fawcett did not find a South American plateau populated with dinosaurs, he did lead numerous expeditions looking for lost civilizations. On his last and most ambitious—seeking the City of Z—he vanished. Over the past seventy-five years there have been hundreds of other expeditions into the Amazon, by a myriad of adventurers, looking for Percy Fawcett. All failed. Hundreds died. Many were never heard from again.Fawcett marked the end of an age. He was the last of the individualist explores. The day of the airplane, the radio, the organized and heavily financed modern expedition had not arrived. With him, it was the heroic story of a man against a vast uncharted wilderness nearly the size of the continental United States inhabited by deadly warriors.Armed with newly discovered information found in a trunk by one of Fawcett’s grandchildren the author, after completing exhaustive research, decides to enter the Amazon and follow the path of Fawcett’s last journey. This is a little eye-brow lifting because the author is a middle aged slightly chunky New Yorker who is the complete opposite of the rigorously trained, physically fit, handsome Fawcett. Thus the consequence of obsession, I guess.Throughout the nineteenth century there was a tremendous speculation concerning the ‘lesser’ civilizations and their inability to reach a level of sophistication beyond living in huts and foraging for food. Darwin did nothing to dispel this attitude—in fact, augmented it. Fawcett was unique in his vision and belief that remote jungle societies could indeed build out of stone, decipher the movements of the stars and create a written language. Without any concrete knowledge of its existence, he was determined to find proof, in the form of a magnificent stone city—he called Z—in the blank parts of the Amazon maps.For Fawcett’s final, and according to him ‘definitive’ 1925 excursion, instead of a group of hunter/explorers, he took only his twenty-one year old son Jack, and Jack’s companion Raleigh Rimell (who really wanted to go to Hollywood and become a silent movie star). For a while the trio sent native runners out of the jungle with progress reports. Their messages would be telegraphed to cities in the United States and eventually newspapers around the world published accounts of their progress. The world literally followed their escapades like a serial novel. Then everything stopped. And the world went nuts. Every major geographical society mounted rescue parties. Finding Fawcett Fever lasted for years. Even in the 1950’s there were rumors Fawcett was still alive and lording like a king over a remote tribe. In the 1960’s, rescue parties were mounted and sent into the wilds. More people died searching for Fawcett than looking for the headwaters of the Nile or panning gold in the Pacific northwest. It’s a pretty amazing story and a whopping good read. The author knows how to pace his story and exactly the right time to intersperse details of his own trek though the tropical forest.I have always wondered about these curious lines from ‘Othello”:And of the Cannibals that each other eat,The Anthropophagi, and men whose headsDo grow beneath their shoulders.It comes from an idea Shakespeare borrowed from Sir Walter Raleigh writing about Francisco de Orellana, whose expedition into the Amazon vanished in 1542. One of the many Christian xenophobes who contributed to slavery in the Western hemisphere. (Raleigh, not Shakespeare.)The author doesn’t have an ending and the story looses its momentum towards the end, but it is an intriguing story, well researched and a very interesting read. Completely enjoyable."

And there's even more fun here: swarming mosquitoes that carry disease, small catfish that like to lodge themselves IN the anus or urethra and can only be removed by surgery, blood-sucking bats, disease, parasites, and Indians in the bush just waiting to shoot you with poison arrows and shrink your head, sell it to collectors, and have it turn up in a pawn shop in Vegas. WICKED! Fawcett's eventual disappearance and the likelihood that an ancient, advanced civilization thrived in the Amazon and was wiped out by conquistadors are sobering reminders that this incredible story is as true as it gets. This book is a mystery, an adventure tale, and travelogue all rolled into one fly-through read. And it's the kind of thing that makes spreadsheets, the 9 to 5 drill, and even Excel, bearable. KICKED ASS. READ IT! "
139,0385513534,http://goodreads.com/user/show/595788-alex-telander,5,"In 1925 one of the world’s last explorers, Percy Fawcett, traveled into the heart of the Amazon jungle with his son for his last expedition in search of a lost civilization. It was a worldwide publicized event, with Fawcett writing journal entries and having a messenger take them to the nearest large town to be sent via telegraph to the rest of the world. Then the entries suddenly stopped and Fawcett was never heard from again. Expeditions were made to discover what happened to them; nothing was ever found, while some more people were lost to the Amazon. The Lost City of Z is the story of Percy Fawcett, his life and how he became a great explorer, and where his obsession for the Amazon came from. It is also the story of the mystery of this doomed last expedition, and all the efforts – some ending in tragedy – that have been made since then.David Grann is a staff writer for the New Yorker who first found out about Percy Fawcett while researching an article on the mysterious death of the world’s foremost Sherlock Holmes expert. The Lost City of Z takes Grann all over the world, from visiting Fawcett’s great granddaughter and seeing some of his original journal entries, to putting together his own expedition to find out what really happened to Percy Fawcett. The Lost City of Z is the incredible story of one of the last explorers, but it is also the story of the strength of the human spirit and it’s drive to never give up. Percy Fawcett was a real life Indiana Jones and this is his fascinating story.Originally written on February 9th 2010 ©Alex C. Telander.For more reviews and author interviews, go to Bookbanter.net"

I liked the format with the biographical and historical information interspersed with the authors research in libraries and archives, and shopping trips to adventure outfitters. How had I never heard of the Fawcett mystery until now? It seems like a story ripe for Hollywood or various adventure stories, so it is a wonder that it took this long to have some quality research on the topic (or have I just been ignorant of this?) Interesting aside - as I was reading this, my husband is reading Candice Millard's *River of Doubt* about Roosevelt's travels in Amazon. It was intriguing to hear the Grann citing that book, and for my husband and I to discuss the two expeditions and how they differed. I look forward to reading that book soon to continue my own little obsession with rainforest adventure stories...This book describes a very different Amazon than the one I encountered on my trip to Peru in 2007 - of course, I was not in the deepest darkest part of the forest, but we were ""roughing it"" by a lot of standards... I guess that is because over the last century there have been significant strides in public health and sanitation, disease prevention, and research on tropical climes... even in the author's travels in 2006 and 2007, he describes a very different Brazilian rainforest than Fawcett encountered 80 years prior. This alone causes some concern that things can change so significantly in the relatively short span of years..."
141,0385513534,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1600029-helen,2,"The book is about the explorer Fawcett's quest for the lost city of El Dorado, called ""Z"" in the Amazon.Because no one really and truly knows what DID happen to Fawcett and his son in their last Amazon region in 1925, a large amount of the book is filler. Fawcett's British colonial background, his early years, other explorations, his family, his involvement in the Royal Geographical Society and the colonial and imperialist mix that was current in the late 19th and early 20th century in England ... it's all filler.Finally, finally, FINALLY the author takes the reader on his recent journey to the same area where Fawcett was last reported. The upshot is still that no one knows what happened, despite numerous attempts by numerous people to find out. The book ends with a short description of recent archaeological discoveries in the region that have uncovered much larger population centers and could have given rise to stories about an El Dorado or Z.That's it. The book could have been condensed into 50 pages and told exactly the same story."

Tragically, Fawcett never found Z...or did he? Legend has it Fawcett was killed or captured by hostile tribes, starved to death, or perhaps as some fringe groups believe he transcended mortality when he found and entered the lost city of Z. Journalist David Grann finds new information regarding Fawcett's secret route and eventually follows Fawcett into an area of the world that still remains largely unknown - and hostile - to outsiders.

143,0385513534,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16407549-andrea-cox,2,"This was an okay book for me. It contains inappropriate pictures, associated with the lack of clothing on natives in the Amazon. Along with that, the descriptions in the book are sometimes more than I would have liked, whether it be about bodies, diseases, deaths, etc. There were many bizarre religions mentioned, including the occult.The adventure Fawcett must have thrived on throughout his life was evident in this book, and it's what kept me reading when the story went on a tangent, which happened often. It would have been much easier to read if the author had chosen either his own experiences or Fawcett's to focus on throughout, as the jumps from one POV to the next were quite jarring most of the time. However, I did enjoy learning about the various journeys taken by both men.This was an informative book. I am glad I read it, but I don't think I'll be reading it again.I was not compensated for my honest review."

145,0385513534,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1256603-sara,5,"You wouldn't think that a book featuring lost civilizations in the Amazon rain forest, cannibals, wild beasts, natives shooting poisoned arrows, mad men, and more man eating bugs then I ever want to encounter in a book ever again would best be described as subtle but such is the case with the totally wicked awesome Lost City of Z.David Grann, a reporter for the New Yorker, becomes intrigued by the story of Percy Fawcett an explorer in the early 1900's who became internationally famous for his forays into the Amazon rain forest with little more then a machete and an almost god like ability to survive even the most insane situations. In the course of his explorations Fawcett became obsessed with the idea of a lost civilization somewhere in the Amazon, a technologically and culturally advanced society hidden somewhere in the dense, impenetrable jungle. I'm not spoiling anything to let you know that Fawcett never found his city, which he mysteriously nicknamed ""Z,"" at 58 he took his 22 year old son and his son's best friend into the jungle determined to finally find it. The three men never returned and a legend was born.Over the years hundreds of would be rescuers and explorers have attempted to learn the fate of the last Fawcett expedition and/or discover Fawcett's fabled city.Grann joins their ranks and determines to journey there himself, leaving a wife and newborn son in New York City, to try to find the truth.There are two perfectly blended journey's here. Grann takes a ""no apologies"" approach in his exploration of Fawcett's life. We meet the tireless, obsessed explorer, negligent father and husband and the aggressive, easily offended bully who called anyone who couldn't match his 10 mile treks through unexplored jungle a ""coward."" Fawcett was certainly a thoroughly unlikable person but, as Grann takes pains to point out, its impossible to ignore his strength, dedication and intelligence. He changed the more time he spent in the Amazon among the tribes that lived there. He came to question the Victorian ""make the world England"" approach that was playing the same role the Spanish had years earlier in killing, subjugating and erasing the people who had thrived there for a thousand years. He fought bitterly against his own nature and that of his country to argue that ""savage"" was an abhorrent term perhaps best used to describe those attempting to ""civilize"" a people far beyond them already.Then we have Grann who through his own journey to the Amazon comes to understand that for all Fawcett's successes he lost site of those closest to him, those who needed him and depended upon him. He realizes that he too has become so blind to everything but this quest that he's abandoned his own family without a second thought.So yes, this is a book about crazy amazing adventures and secrets in the jungle and its amazingly exciting and so much fun to listen to at night right before bed. It really is like Indiana Jones comes to life (hell there's apparently an Indiana Jones novel ABOUT Fawcett and his city) but its also about what we lose when we put dreams ahead of everything else. Subtle and heart stopping. A nice combo it turns out."
146,0385513534,http://goodreads.com/user/show/83144-el,4,"I love a good yarn. I love those crazy stories about hidden treasures, travels to the ends of the earth, and driving obsessions - the more real they are, the better.In the Twenties, explorer Percy Fawcett wandered into the jungles of the Amazon to find the Lost City of Z, aka the ancient civilization, El Dorado. He was obsessed with the concept of this hidden civilization, and spent years researching and studying before embarking on his journey. But what happened? We know that most of his team died along the way, and that he sent his then 21-year-old son back home. But then the story ends basically, because Fawcett never made it out of the jungle. Was he driven to death by his own obsession? Was he eaten by a ginormous snake? Did he find the Lost City of Z and decide to just hang there for the rest of his days? David Grann picks up the story by not necessarily answering those questions, but by trying to follow in Fawcett's footsteps. Well... without that pesky ""getting-lost-in-the-Amazon-and-probably-dying"" thing.This is an engrossing story and totally fulfilled the wannabe archeologist I have inside, all the while reminding me that I would never last in the Amazon. It's hot, it's humid, there are bugs I've never even imagined (and I'm not being especially girly - I'm talking about mosquitoes that suck the juice off your eyeballs or those annoying things that basically get inside your junk and can not be removed), vampire bats, and did I mention the humidity? Yeah, it's not really a place that I could call home, but Fawcett apparently could, and Grann sure as heck could at least hang with the best of them. More power to those guys.Still, the bouncing back and forth between Grann's own expedition and that of Fawcett's was distracting at times. It would have been better if Grann just took one storyline and ran with it as they are singularly pretty fascinating. But Grann did a decent job of finding primary sources to back his (and Fawcett's) claims. My list of books to hunt down now has increased exponentially, and I suppose I can thank Grann for that, though I think it has more to do with the absolute craziness that possessed Fawcett that makes me want to know more about him."
147,0385513534,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4026072-kim,4,"I love travel and adventure and ancient civiliations so a real-life journey is a must-read for me. It is amazing how many people had invested time, money and, in some cases, their lives to search for a group that people said shouldn't have gone in the first place. Maybe if those people had helped fund the expedition they wouldn't have gone missing. Or as some conspiracies say maybe he wanted to go missing.But there's a part of me that would have also wanted to rush out looking for him. And that's the part that believes in the lost city of Z. Not the city of gold or the gilded man but the ancient civilization of the Amazon. The people and cities the original European explorers reported that were never seen again. And which science and archaeologists are finally confirming as being real. I would love to join the digs in South America, maybe one day I will.So why only 4 stars? The book is too short. I know it was originally written as an article and then extended but it was over too quick. I was really getting into the story and the discoveries when it finished. Now I'll have to find more books on the subject."

Grann's descriptions of all the horrible ways the Amazon can invade the body make me never want to stand in a forest again. However, the book did end on a good note: in awe of the great unknown civilizations that not only survive but thrived in the Amazon. I also found Grann's portrayal of the individuals that journeyed into the Amazon (and the people they left behind) interesting enough in themselves. What kind of people are compelled again and again to enter into a lonely hell? "

150,0385513534,http://goodreads.com/user/show/869064-jeremy,3,"This is kind of an odd accomplishment: an adventure book that will make you really really glad your not an adventurer. Grann's descriptions of Fawcett et al trampling through the amazonian rainforest with their crass, (often racist) imperialist delusions of grandeur and discovery are often gut-wrenching. Skin peels off in sheets, everyone gets malaria, parasites, maggot infections (shudder), gangrene, etc. Trekking through unspoiled tropical jungles is utterly horrifying, you basically just turn yourself into an oozing, walking meal and wait for the rainforest to literally devour you. Grann remains fairly non-judgmental through out. After all, it's the green hell of the jungle itself which finally breaks down and destroys hubris and good intentions alike. Seriously, some of this stuff would make Werner Herzog blush."
151,0385513534,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3195534-melanie,3,"3*. Well that was interesting! For most of the book I thought Percy Fawcett (the explorer whom the book is about) was probably a complete wack-a-doodle. At the end of the book, maybe only partially a wack-a-doodle but you do have to be somewhat obsessed to keep going back into that environment looking for a fabled ""Lost City"". I cannot fathom trekking into the Amazon jungle in our times with modern technology let alone in the 1920's when Fawcett did it. It is not a place I would ever desire to experience, just on the bug issue alone! Gross stuff in there!! The book is a bit long in places but overall pretty good.(Why is GR marking everything as read twice when it's only been read once?). Maddening!"

The author also has a new non-fiction book to be published in April, 2017: Killers of the Flower Moon. My original review:: ""This is a very readable, well researched book. It focuses on explorer Colonel Percy Fawcett, and his obsession to find a great. ancient city deep in the Amazon jungle which he called Z. Z ,if it existed, may have given rise to the legend of El Dorado. The book tells the story of Fawcett's quests, and of the author attempting to journey to the Amazon to try to solve some of the mystery around Fawcett's mysterious disappearance on his 1925 expedition.  Anyone interested in early 20th century exploration and past and present day Amazonia should enjoy this book. Prior to his ill-fated journey, Fawcett had explored the Amazon several times before. He was an arrogant man, rarely getting along with those who accompanied him on his journeys. He seemed immune to most tropical illnesses and scorned those who became ill or couldn't keep up to his break-neck pace, regarding them as weak. His obsession to find Z bordered on madness as he consulted spiritualists. The author found that his papers showed ever increasing bizarre beliefs. For his last journey he advertised for strong men to accompany him (no women allowed). A large number of scientists, explorers, athletes and people wanting adventure or just wishing to get just away from home replied. Among those turned down was Lawrence of Arabia . Fawcett felt that a person used to the desert would never keep up to him in the jungle. Instead he decided to go accompanied by his 21 year old son and the son's best friend.  As Fawcett was very secretive, not wanting any rival explorer to find Z before he did, his exact route was unknown or sometimes written in code. The disappearance of Fawcett and the two young men caused a sensation, and countless people also vanished or died searching for them.It also tells the stories of other explorers in the early part half of the 1800's. These adventurers have now been replaced by archaeologists and anthropologists. Grann discovers in his journey a ruins which may have led to the legend of Z which is now being studied and excavated, and he believes he knows the fate of Fawcett and the two young men from stories passed on by several Indian tribes."""
154,0385513534,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6969151-veeral,4,"That obnoxious Amazon. It likes to monopolize and dominate the jungle. Although one might be led to believe that there would be an abundance of everything where such a mighty force exists, the truth is exactly the opposite. As David Grann puts it himself: It’s the great “counterfeit paradise”. I couldn’t agree more. Amazon will starve you. Amazon will desiccate you. And finally, Amazon will obliterate you. Because, simply put, Amazon doesn’t care for you. It’s a green desert. Unfit for human civilization.Take the example of Colonel Percy Harrison Fawcett. He wanted to make “the great discovery of the century” by finding the cryptic lost City of Z but instead, the uncaring Amazon rainforest consumed him, his son (Jack) and his son’s friend (Raleigh Rimell). So, “the great discovery of the century” became infamous as what has often been described as “the greatest exploration mystery of the twentieth century”— that is, the mystery of the fate of Percy Fawcett and the whereabouts of the lost City of Z.Many have tried to solve the mystery over the years, but failed.No one could find exactly what happened to Fawcett and certainly no one could find any clues that Z ever existed. But why should it exist? It was really pointless of us to assume right from the start that a civilization could prosper under something as brutal and vainglorious as Amazon. Sure, Grann did made some flimsy attempts by the end of the book by hinting that a civilized colony might have existed in the Amazon in the past, but that didn’t half-convince me.So, one thing I would definitely take away from this book is the fact that, Amazon is the bane of civilization."
155,0385513534,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5858699-kavita,4,"David Grann is a journalist, who got fascinated with the legend of Percy Fawcett, the Amazon explorer who disappeared into the Amazon in 1925, along with his son and his son's friend. Fawcett's obsession with an ancient and highly complex civilisation within the Amazon rainforest forms the basis of this book. Grann sets out to prove that Fawcett was right, and makes a journey into the Amazon himself.The Lost City of Z is basically a biography of Fawcett and concentrates on his quest for the legendary city that he called Z. I originally assumed that it was Grann's own journey into the Amazon which would be described here. There were short chapters in which he got ready to enter the forest, and since the story was not about it, it all turned out to be superficial. It would have been much better if Grann had concentrated solely on the Fawcett story.Interestingly, Grann quotes from the writings of Spanish conquistadors who had travelled the Amazon in the 1500s. Their descriptions varied from those of Fawcett, because by then, the local tribes had been wiped out massively and the region deforested. Grann's own journey showed yet more deforestation and extinction of life since the 1900s. Sadly, a few hundred years down the line, we might not have an Amazon rainforest left despite its vastness, so these accounts are valuable. The real appeal of the book, of course, lies in the fact that you can enjoy the deadly rainforest from the comfort of your couch. Not for us the risking of our lives and confronting snakes, mosquitoes, and other creatures of the rainforest, not to mention battling disease, hunger, and thirst. For us, the delight of expertly sliding into a beautiful world you can romanticise without really having to move a muscle. The Inferno Verde can become a Paraíso Verde."
156,0385513534,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39134508-kathleen,4,"This book was chosen by my book club as the non-fiction book for the month. I am hoping that it will qualify for a Bingo square - name of a city in the title ""Lost City of Z"". David Grann is a reporter and states at the beginning of the book that he isn't the type to get involved in the stories he works on and researches. Once he finishes a story he moves on to the next one. But like other adventurers, David did get caught up in the ""greatest exploration mystery of the twentieth century"" and set out to solve the story about the disappearance of British explorer Perry Faucett, and his son in the Amazon. What happened to them while they were searching for the Lost City of Z? This is a very informative and interesting non-fiction book that reads much like an Indiana Jones adventure story. David Grann expertly weaves geography, history and science together resulting in a breath-taking narrative. I listened to the audiobook of this story narrated by the talented Mark Deakins. He is one of my favourite narrators because he uses different voices for each character, and the voices seem to fit the character -bringing the story ""alive"". (I have read over 160 audio books and feel this audiobook enhanced my experience reading this book. If you are new to audio books, I think you should opt for reading this in print.)I highly recommend this non-fiction book for readers interested in history, explorations, and the Amazon."

This is a new classic of the narrative nonfiction genre.The prose is vivid and intoxicating, and he weaves together 2+ threads, seamlessly--with the Fawcett thread dominant, as it should be, yet given fresh life with the mingling of the contemporary thread.I was drawn in from the start, but oddly enough, I REALLY got fascinated when he got to the developing field of cultural anthropology, and the fights over whether the people in the Amazon were ""noble savages"" or just ""savages,"" or stupid subhumans, or . . . and what the apparent tiny population really meant. Throughout the book, there was an adventure story going on, but a much wider, deeper consideration of how the discoveries there fundamentally altered our conceptions of how and why we all are the way we are. And it crept into those ideas artfully, interestingly and never pedantically. It never bogged down into a university course: felt more like an exciting speaker spurring our curiosity and helping us run with it.So well done. I'll use this as one of my models for all my future books.(And as a writer, I can't resist saying: Great verbs! I mean, stupendously great, every page, every paragraph. Never too much, consistently just right.)"

In fact, I remember clearly that I didn't want to see it. The name sounded silly, and I had no clue what it was about. Visions of pirates and space creatures clouded my judgment. Luckily, my friends dragged me in by majority vote and I emerged from the theater two hours later, exhilarated, endlessly curious about early human cultures, and determined to live a more exciting life. And it stuck. Years later, I stood in the middle of Albuquerque receiving my degree in Anthropology, still consumed with a passion for learning about ancient human history and lost worlds. Percy Fawcett, the adventurer, explorer, and land surveyor at the heart of ""The Lost City of Z"" would have most likely seen a lot of himself in Indiana Jones. If ever there were a real-life version of the intrepid anthropologist, Fawcett would definitely be a frontrunner. And fate seemed to lead him there. In his early military years in Ceylon, Fawcett heard the legend of a lost city buried beneath an earthen mound near his base. He took it upon himself to try to locate this lost world, and appears to have had some success, although he did not have the wherewithal at the time to excavate it. Still, the thrill of the find and the desire to pursue other ""lost worlds"" grabbed hold of him then, and planted the seed of obsession that would follow him throughout the rest of his life. Working for the Royal Geographical Society, Fawcett was sent to the largely uncharted and dangerous forests of the Amazon. By many accounts, there seems to be no crueler environment in the world. When I was once contemplating graduate field work, I recalled the stories of an anthropologist who had visited our class to tell us about his work with the Yanamami, a tribe so fascinating and remote that many classmates later expressed their desire to do the same. But me? Not in the least. I knew the last place on earth I ever wanted to live - even for a short time - was within the bug-infested, snake-laden, vampire-bat heavy jaguar lair that is the Amazon. Mosquitoes love me here in New England. Imagine the feast I would provide them in the rain forest. I would be nearly bloodless in a week. But Fawcett, he was made for the place. Surveying the formerly unexplored (by white men) border between Brazil and Bolivia, he accomplished his mission nearly a year ahead of schedule. This despite losing half his team to disease, the arrows of hostile tribes, parasitic worms, viral infections, and starvation. By all accounts, Fawcett was impervious to disease, boasting a hardy constitution unphased by the rigors of a jungle so dense that a day's worth of hacking through it with machetes sometimes only gained the team a half a mile of advancement. His amazing physical stamina and seeming disdain for the suffering of others bred one of two things in the men who served him: intense loyalty or mutinous desire. The tales of both of these conditions in his many journeys back into the jungle after his acclaimed first mission, are the stuff of legend. But, somewhere along the way, Fawcett began to hear about a Lost City, much like the famed El Dorado, a city of vast palaces and towering pillars, filled with riches and covered in gold dust. Having encountered a smaller version of this phenomenon in Ceylon, Fawcett became intrigued. As time went on, intrigue turned to obsession, as more and more of the oral histories he encountered in the tribes he befriended, as well as the geographical and archaeological record that had newly been discovered began to substantiate the claims. When Hiram Bingham discovered Machu Picchu during the same time period as Fawcett's work, it only fueled his desire to find his own ""lost world."" ""The Lost City of Z"" is brilliantly told and exhaustively researched by David Grann. Needless to say, Fawcett's final mission involved a last ditch effort to find the city, taking only his grown son, his son's best friend and a couple of temporary native guides. They went into the forest in 1925 and were never heard from again. Since that time, literally hundreds of amateur explorers have trekked into the same hostile jungles to try to find the missing Colonel and his companions. As recently as 1995, a Bolivian businessman and his grown son (along with an expert team and the best technological aids) tried to finally find out what happened to the Fawcett team all those years ago, only to find themselves taken captive by an Amazonian tribe. (The tribe debated whether or not to kill them for three days until finally releasing them in exchange for their thirty thousand dollars worth of equipment.) And this was 1995 - not 1925. It is no wonder that Grann himself finally feels compelled to witness the land where Percy Fawcett was lost forever. His journey, which he documents late in the book, is far more eventful than I would have imagined, and his final meeting with the anthropologist Michael Hecklenberger, who has lived in the Amazon for over a dozen years now, was insightful and educational. For anyone who has ever felt the pull of exploration, imagined the thrill of a lost world, or even just really enjoyed the exploits of Indiana Jones, pick up this fascinating book. I doubt it will make you want to trek through the Amazon, (in fact, it may dissuade you from going to a jungle anywhere, ever, under any circumstances), but it might just make you want to explore a new culture, visit a museum, or even just take the long way home. And if it does, Percy Fawcett may have succeeded in some small way."
161,0385513534,http://goodreads.com/user/show/798978-barbara,5,"The story of ""Colonel"" Fawcett, and his explorations of the Amazon were once world known. Fawcett was searching for a legendary city in the jungle. He began his explorations in the 19th century. In the Victorian Age exploration was done by amateurs, and the field of anthropology was in its infancy. Fawcett's trips were financed by the Royal Geographic Society in London. Fawcett was relentless, driving his family into bankruptcy. On his final trip in 1925, he and his son, and a third man, disappeared.The descriptions of the explorations were hair raising. The insects were not only pests but dangerous. I won't go into detail but their effect on humans are disgusting. There was also danger from some the the warlike tribes, who as recently as the 1990's killed outsiders who wandered into their territory.The author Grann decides to investigate Fawcett and the ""lost city"". This book is mostly a report of Fawcett's life, and expeditions. He was famous not only for his numerous journeys, but his ability to form friendships with Amazon Indians, and his appreciation of their way of life. Grann himself travels to Brazil over a 100 years after Fawcett disappeared. This is a fascinating account, and one I found hard to put down."
162,0385513534,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1605591-christine,5,"	Shortly after I finished this book, the BBC World Service reported that a Brazilian man who advocated for small farmers, natives, and the rain forest was murdered. He was shot five times in the head while biking with his wife. The same report made reference to the 2005 killing of an American nun, a murder that Grann mentions in his book. What the news report drove home was the idea that the Amazon is still a dangerous place, just not exactly in the same way it was during Fawcett’s time. Instead of worrying about how a misunderstanding with a native tribe could end in the death of tribal members or of the group of explorers, the battle is now between business and various types of conversation. In many ways, a more violent battle, not just because everyone has guns.	This idea is not wholly examined in The Lost City of Z, though David Grann does touch on it in the closing chapters of his book, and the idea of the destruction of the natural world does run though a good portion of the book.	Much of the book is about Fawcett and his various trips to the Amazon; culminating in what was undoubtedly a fatal trip to find a “lost” city that he had named Z.	In fact, if you are going to learn anything from this book (and you are), the most important is the simple fact that if the natives tell you not to do something or go somewhere, LISTEN TO THEM! THEY KNOW FROM WHENCE THEY SPEAK!	(I’m using the slightly political incorrect term of natives because I am a good American who has been taught that Indian refers to a person from India. South American Native Americans is way too wordy, there too many tribes to list all the tribe names, and the term Native American or First People [nations:] would make me sound like the news anchor on CNN who referred to the African immigrants protesting/rioting in Paris a few years back as African-Americans.)	Fawcett was a man who spent more time in the Amazon then with his family. As an aside, Grann does a wonderful job of showing the strength of character of both Nina Fawcett and Grann’s own wife, making both women sound just as, if not more, heroic than their husbands. In fact, Mr. Grann, your wife sounds far more intelligent than you. (Sorry, don’t mean to offend, but she knew you needed more than sneakers before heading into the Amazon). The men who explored the Amazon seemed to have married very understand and supportive women (and, if possible, very rich women). While her husband was dealing with nasty bugs and a fish that could swim up his wee-wee, Nina Fawcett was giving birth to their second child, raising their first (eventually raising all three children), keeping house, and protecting her husband’s reputation, all of this on a rather limited budget.	To be far, Fawcett seemed to know that he was unworthy of her. This is what makes the book charming. It’s warts and all, and the people who have warts, know they have them. It’s very human.	Fawcett became convinced that there was lost civilization in the Amazon, basically a version of the city of gold myth. It was during an attempt to find this city that Fawcett, his eldest son Jack, and his son’s closest friend disappeared in the Amazon. The disappearance set off searches, rescue missions, and theories (such as this book), possibly resulting in another 100 deaths/disappearances.	Grann seems aware of his obsession and the risks it brings to both himself and his family. In fact, it seems like this is going to be his only big adventure. It seems he learned a lesson that Fawcett didn’t or couldn’t learn.	In some ways, the most interesting part of the book is the closing chapter which describes what a lost civilization in the Amazon is truly. Think the Incas, the Mayans, the Aztecs but in a different country. If the rain forest is turned wholly over to big business, if its defenders and supporters are murdered then not only do the flora and fauna of the Amazon disappear, not only do tribal cultures (if not whole tribes) die, but the Lost City of Z will still forever be lost."

While not really giving any sort of definitive answer to what happened to Percy Fawcett on his last expedition, the book was a wonderfully researched book on turn of the century amateur exploration and the competition that ensued between these gentleman rivals.While the final discovery was a great vindication of those explorers who felt that there had to be some sort of great civilization in the Amazon region, we are still not sure that Z has been or ever will be found.Nonetheless, this is one journey that I was happy to make with the author and am amazed at the treasure trove of new information he was able to provide everyone."

The story of real-life adventurer Fawcett was interesting in itself, of course, but maybe not quite five stars. HOWEVER, I was pleasantly surprised that the book also gave me a sense of early 20th popular culture. I walked away with a new perspective on the environment that produced stories like The Lost World and At the Mountains of Madness. Also, I have scratched the deep amazon off my list of places to go hiking."

166,0385513534,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35799-amy,4,"Colonel Percy Harrison Fawcett was quite a famous explorer in his day. The last of the ""great Victorian explorers"", he inspired the creation of Indiana Jones (and quite possibly Commander McBragg). He was as well known at the time as Dr. Livingstone, and had a reputation of being indestructible. He became obsessed with El Dorado, the mythical (?) city of gold, which he also referred to as Z. In 1925, he took his oldest son and one of his son's friends on an expedition into the jungles of Brazil to find it. They were never seen again outside of the Amazon. Over the course of the next decades, dozens of expeditions set out to find the Fawcett party, or traces of it, including other famous explorers of the time, an actor who had played an explorer (!), and Fawcett's younger son Brian. Some of them were also lost. In addition, many people died just looking for El Dorado. More modern science concluded that no complex civilization could have endured in the Amazon, in so hostile an environment.This book tells the story of Fawcett and traces this final expedition. The author even traveled to Brazil himself to try to follow Fawcett's last trail and try to find out what exactly happened to him. (When he reached one point where Fawcett had been in the jungle, he said that it looked ""like Nebraska"" now - deforestation is real.) Using Fawcett's private notes from previous trips that the family shared with him, as well as dispatches from his final one, Grann was able to find the spot where he thought they had started from (Fawcett had said one thing in his public notes for the Royal Geographic Society, to keep the exact location confidential because other explorers were out there looking. But Grann found another set of coordinates in Fawcett's private notes).I don't know anything about this man or his expeditions, but it seems to me that Grann has helped answer some of the questions that surrounded him. And maybe the Amazon isn't as hostile to agriculture and society as previously thought?On the other hand.... it is pretty much just waiting to kill you so I don't recommend trying it."

Even though Steven wouldn’t give the poor guy a chance to talk, the story seemed right up my alley so I picked up the book the next day. Isn’t that why authors appear on talk shows, so that numb-nuts like me will rush to Borders?Percy Harrison Fawcett was the real-life explorer whose adventures Arthur Conan Doyle drew upon for his 1912 novel ‘The Lost Word.’ While Fawcett did not find a South American plateau populated with dinosaurs, he did lead numerous expeditions looking for lost civilizations. On his last and most ambitious—seeking the City of Z—he vanished. Over the past seventy-five years there have been hundreds of other expeditions into the Amazon, by a myriad of adventurers, looking for Percy Fawcett. All failed. Hundreds died. Many were never heard from again.Fawcett marked the end of an age. He was the last of the individualist explores. The day of the airplane, the radio, the organized and heavily financed modern expedition had not arrived. With him, it was the heroic story of a man against a vast uncharted wilderness nearly the size of the continental United States inhabited by deadly warriors.Armed with newly discovered information found in a trunk by one of Fawcett’s grandchildren the author, after completing exhaustive research, decides to enter the Amazon and follow the path of Fawcett’s last journey. This is a little eye-brow lifting because the author is a middle aged slightly chunky New Yorker who is the complete opposite of the rigorously trained, physically fit, handsome Fawcett. Thus the consequence of obsession, I guess.Throughout the nineteenth century there was a tremendous speculation concerning the ‘lesser’ civilizations and their inability to reach a level of sophistication beyond living in huts and foraging for food. Darwin did nothing to dispel this attitude—in fact, augmented it. Fawcett was unique in his vision and belief that remote jungle societies could indeed build out of stone, decipher the movements of the stars and create a written language. Without any concrete knowledge of its existence, he was determined to find proof, in the form of a magnificent stone city—he called Z—in the blank parts of the Amazon maps.For Fawcett’s final, and according to him ‘definitive’ 1925 excursion, instead of a group of hunter/explorers, he took only his twenty-one year old son Jack, and Jack’s companion Raleigh Rimell (who really wanted to go to Hollywood and become a silent movie star). For a while the trio sent native runners out of the jungle with progress reports. Their messages would be telegraphed to cities in the United States and eventually newspapers around the world published accounts of their progress. The world literally followed their escapades like a serial novel. Then everything stopped. And the world went nuts. Every major geographical society mounted rescue parties. Finding Fawcett Fever lasted for years. Even in the 1950’s there were rumors Fawcett was still alive and lording like a king over a remote tribe. In the 1960’s, rescue parties were mounted and sent into the wilds. More people died searching for Fawcett than looking for the headwaters of the Nile or panning gold in the Pacific northwest. It’s a pretty amazing story and a whopping good read. The author knows how to pace his story and exactly the right time to intersperse details of his own trek though the tropical forest.I have always wondered about these curious lines from ‘Othello”:And of the Cannibals that each other eat,The Anthropophagi, and men whose headsDo grow beneath their shoulders.It comes from an idea Shakespeare borrowed from Sir Walter Raleigh writing about Francisco de Orellana, whose expedition into the Amazon vanished in 1542. One of the many Christian xenophobes who contributed to slavery in the Western hemisphere. (Raleigh, not Shakespeare.)The author doesn’t have an ending and the story looses its momentum towards the end, but it is an intriguing story, well researched and a very interesting read. Completely enjoyable."

That is, talking about sales forecasts, writing up spread sheets and cursing Excel when I couldn't copy/paste from one cell to another, and being encouraged to think of ways I could improve the company while knowing I could be laid off at any minute. All so common, and all such a snore. Now, even my exciting life in Italy is still tedious at times, albeit for different reasons.Then a book like this comes along to rip us out of the goddamn delirium of every day life. This is the true story of when men were men and the world was a place to be explored and conquered so that the blank places on maps could be filled in and the Queen could get a few more jewels in her crown. The ballsiest of all explorers, Percy Fawcett, thought that hiking through the Amazon in a search for the legendary city of El Dorado was a good way to spend his time. KICK ASS. And there's even more fun here: swarming mosquitoes that carry disease, small catfish that like to lodge themselves IN the anus or urethra and can only be removed by surgery, blood-sucking bats, disease, parasites, and Indians in the bush just waiting to shoot you with poison arrows and shrink your head, sell it to collectors, and have it turn up in a pawn shop in Vegas. WICKED! Fawcett's eventual disappearance and the likelihood that an ancient, advanced civilization thrived in the Amazon and was wiped out by conquistadors are sobering reminders that this incredible story is as true as it gets. This book is a mystery, an adventure tale, and travelogue all rolled into one fly-through read. And it's the kind of thing that makes spreadsheets, the 9 to 5 drill, and even Excel, bearable.

It was a worldwide publicized event, with Fawcett writing journal entries and having a messenger take them to the nearest large town to be sent via telegraph to the rest of the world. Then the entries suddenly stopped and Fawcett was never heard from again. Expeditions were made to discover what happened to them; nothing was ever found, while some more people were lost to the Amazon. The Lost City of Z is the story of Percy Fawcett, his life and how he became a great explorer, and where his obsession for the Amazon came from. It is also the story of the mystery of this doomed last expedition, and all the efforts – some ending in tragedy – that have been made since then.David Grann is a staff writer for the New Yorker who first found out about Percy Fawcett while researching an article on the mysterious death of the world’s foremost Sherlock Holmes expert. The Lost City of Z takes Grann all over the world, from visiting Fawcett’s great granddaughter and seeing some of his original journal entries, to putting together his own expedition to find out what really happened to Percy Fawcett. The Lost City of Z is the incredible story of one of the last explorers, but it is also the story of the strength of the human spirit and it’s drive to never give up. Percy Fawcett was a real life Indiana Jones and this is his fascinating story.Originally written on February 9th 2010 ©Alex C. Telander.For more reviews and author interviews, go to Bookbanter.net"

I liked the format with the biographical and historical information interspersed with the authors research in libraries and archives, and shopping trips to adventure outfitters. How had I never heard of the Fawcett mystery until now? It seems like a story ripe for Hollywood or various adventure stories, so it is a wonder that it took this long to have some quality research on the topic (or have I just been ignorant of this?) Interesting aside - as I was reading this, my husband is reading Candice Millard's *River of Doubt* about Roosevelt's travels in Amazon. It was intriguing to hear the Grann citing that book, and for my husband and I to discuss the two expeditions and how they differed. I look forward to reading that book soon to continue my own little obsession with rainforest adventure stories...This book describes a very different Amazon than the one I encountered on my trip to Peru in 2007 - of course, I was not in the deepest darkest part of the forest, but we were ""roughing it"" by a lot of standards... I guess that is because over the last century there have been significant strides in public health and sanitation, disease prevention, and research on tropical climes... even in the author's travels in 2006 and 2007, he describes a very different Brazilian rainforest than Fawcett encountered 80 years prior. This alone causes some concern that things can change so significantly in the relatively short span of years..."

Fawcett's British colonial background, his early years, other explorations, his family, his involvement in the Royal Geographical Society and the colonial and imperialist mix that was current in the late 19th and early 20th century in England ... it's all filler.Finally, finally, FINALLY the author takes the reader on his recent journey to the same area where Fawcett was last reported. The upshot is still that no one knows what happened, despite numerous attempts by numerous people to find out. The book ends with a short description of recent archaeological discoveries in the region that have uncovered much larger population centers and could have given rise to stories about an El Dorado or Z.That's it. The book could have been condensed into 50 pages and told exactly the same story."

Legend has it Fawcett was killed or captured by hostile tribes, starved to death, or perhaps as some fringe groups believe he transcended mortality when he found and entered the lost city of Z.

Along with that, the descriptions in the book are sometimes more than I would have liked, whether it be about bodies, diseases, deaths, etc. There were many bizarre religions mentioned, including the occult.The adventure Fawcett must have thrived on throughout his life was evident in this book, and it's what kept me reading when the story went on a tangent, which happened often. It would have been much easier to read if the author had chosen either his own experiences or Fawcett's to focus on throughout, as the jumps from one POV to the next were quite jarring most of the time.

In the course of his explorations Fawcett became obsessed with the idea of a lost civilization somewhere in the Amazon, a technologically and culturally advanced society hidden somewhere in the dense, impenetrable jungle. I'm not spoiling anything to let you know that Fawcett never found his city, which he mysteriously nicknamed ""Z,"" at 58 he took his 22 year old son and his son's best friend into the jungle determined to finally find it. The three men never returned and a legend was born.Over the years hundreds of would be rescuers and explorers have attempted to learn the fate of the last Fawcett expedition and/or discover Fawcett's fabled city.Grann joins their ranks and determines to journey there himself, leaving a wife and newborn son in New York City, to try to find the truth.There are two perfectly blended journey's here. Grann takes a ""no apologies"" approach in his exploration of Fawcett's life. We meet the tireless, obsessed explorer, negligent father and husband and the aggressive, easily offended bully who called anyone who couldn't match his 10 mile treks through unexplored jungle a ""coward."" Fawcett was certainly a thoroughly unlikable person but, as Grann takes pains to point out, its impossible to ignore his strength, dedication and intelligence. He changed the more time he spent in the Amazon among the tribes that lived there. He came to question the Victorian ""make the world England"" approach that was playing the same role the Spanish had years earlier in killing, subjugating and erasing the people who had thrived there for a thousand years. He fought bitterly against his own nature and that of his country to argue that ""savage"" was an abhorrent term perhaps best used to describe those attempting to ""civilize"" a people far beyond them already.Then we have Grann who through his own journey to the Amazon comes to understand that for all Fawcett's successes he lost site of those closest to him, those who needed him and depended upon him. He realizes that he too has become so blind to everything but this quest that he's abandoned his own family without a second thought.So yes, this is a book about crazy amazing adventures and secrets in the jungle and its amazingly exciting and so much fun to listen to at night right before bed. It really is like Indiana Jones comes to life (hell there's apparently an Indiana Jones novel ABOUT Fawcett and his city) but its also about what we lose when we put dreams ahead of everything else. Subtle and heart stopping. A nice combo it turns out."

I love those crazy stories about hidden treasures, travels to the ends of the earth, and driving obsessions - the more real they are, the better.In the Twenties, explorer Percy Fawcett wandered into the jungles of the Amazon to find the Lost City of Z, aka the ancient civilization, El Dorado. He was obsessed with the concept of this hidden civilization, and spent years researching and studying before embarking on his journey. But what happened? We know that most of his team died along the way, and that he sent his then 21-year-old son back home. But then the story ends basically, because Fawcett never made it out of the jungle. Was he driven to death by his own obsession? Was he eaten by a ginormous snake? Did he find the Lost City of Z and decide to just hang there for the rest of his days? David Grann picks up the story by not necessarily answering those questions, but by trying to follow in Fawcett's footsteps. Well... without that pesky ""getting-lost-in-the-Amazon-and-probably-dying"" thing.This is an engrossing story and totally fulfilled the wannabe archeologist I have inside, all the while reminding me that I would never last in the Amazon. It's hot, it's humid, there are bugs I've never even imagined (and I'm not being especially girly - I'm talking about mosquitoes that suck the juice off your eyeballs or those annoying things that basically get inside your junk and can not be removed), vampire bats, and did I mention the humidity? Yeah, it's not really a place that I could call home, but Fawcett apparently could, and Grann sure as heck could at least hang with the best of them. More power to those guys.Still, the bouncing back and forth between Grann's own expedition and that of Fawcett's was distracting at times. It would have been better if Grann just took one storyline and ran with it as they are singularly pretty fascinating. But Grann did a decent job of finding primary sources to back his (and Fawcett's) claims. My list of books to hunt down now has increased exponentially, and I suppose I can thank Grann for that, though I think it has more to do with the absolute craziness that possessed Fawcett that makes me want to know more about him."

It is amazing how many people had invested time, money and, in some cases, their lives to search for a group that people said shouldn't have gone in the first place. Maybe if those people had helped fund the expedition they wouldn't have gone missing. Or as some conspiracies say maybe he wanted to go missing.But there's a part of me that would have also wanted to rush out looking for him. And that's the part that believes in the lost city of Z. Not the city of gold or the gilded man but the ancient civilization of the Amazon. The people and cities the original European explorers reported that were never seen again. And which science and archaeologists are finally confirming as being real. I would love to join the digs in South America, maybe one day I will.So why only 4 stars? The book is too short. I know it was originally written as an article and then extended but it was over too quick. I was really getting into the story and the discoveries when it finished.

Grann's descriptions of Fawcett et al trampling through the amazonian rainforest with their crass, (often racist) imperialist delusions of grandeur and discovery are often gut-wrenching. Skin peels off in sheets, everyone gets malaria, parasites, maggot infections (shudder), gangrene, etc. Trekking through unspoiled tropical jungles is utterly horrifying, you basically just turn yourself into an oozing, walking meal and wait for the rainforest to literally devour you. Grann remains fairly non-judgmental through out. After all, it's the green hell of the jungle itself which finally breaks down and destroys hubris and good intentions alike. Seriously, some of this stuff would make Werner Herzog blush."

For most of the book I thought Percy Fawcett (the explorer whom the book is about) was probably a complete wack-a-doodle. At the end of the book, maybe only partially a wack-a-doodle but you do have to be somewhat obsessed to keep going back into that environment looking for a fabled ""Lost City"". I cannot fathom trekking into the Amazon jungle in our times with modern technology let alone in the 1920's when Fawcett did it. It is not a place I would ever desire to experience, just on the bug issue alone! Gross stuff in there!! The book is a bit long in places but overall pretty good.(Why is GR marking everything as read twice when it's only been read once?). Maddening!"

The author also has a new non-fiction book to be published in April, 2017: Killers of the Flower Moon. My original review:: ""This is a very readable, well researched book. It focuses on explorer Colonel Percy Fawcett, and his obsession to find a great. ancient city deep in the Amazon jungle which he called Z. Z ,if it existed, may have given rise to the legend of El Dorado. The book tells the story of Fawcett's quests, and of the author attempting to journey to the Amazon to try to solve some of the mystery around Fawcett's mysterious disappearance on his 1925 expedition.  Anyone interested in early 20th century exploration and past and present day Amazonia should enjoy this book. Prior to his ill-fated journey, Fawcett had explored the Amazon several times before. He was an arrogant man, rarely getting along with those who accompanied him on his journeys. He seemed immune to most tropical illnesses and scorned those who became ill or couldn't keep up to his break-neck pace, regarding them as weak. His obsession to find Z bordered on madness as he consulted spiritualists. The author found that his papers showed ever increasing bizarre beliefs. For his last journey he advertised for strong men to accompany him (no women allowed). A large number of scientists, explorers, athletes and people wanting adventure or just wishing to get just away from home replied. Among those turned down was Lawrence of Arabia . Fawcett felt that a person used to the desert would never keep up to him in the jungle. Instead he decided to go accompanied by his 21 year old son and the son's best friend.  As Fawcett was very secretive, not wanting any rival explorer to find Z before he did, his exact route was unknown or sometimes written in code. The disappearance of Fawcett and the two young men caused a sensation, and countless people also vanished or died searching for them.It also tells the stories of other explorers in the early part half of the 1800's. These adventurers have now been replaced by archaeologists and anthropologists. Grann discovers in his journey a ruins which may have led to the legend of Z which is now being studied and excavated, and he believes he knows the fate of Fawcett and the two young men from stories passed on by several Indian tribes."""
184,0385513534,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6969151-veeral,4,"That obnoxious Amazon. It likes to monopolize and dominate the jungle. Although one might be led to believe that there would be an abundance of everything where such a mighty force exists, the truth is exactly the opposite. As David Grann puts it himself: It’s the great “counterfeit paradise”. I couldn’t agree more. Amazon will starve you. Amazon will desiccate you. And finally, Amazon will obliterate you. Because, simply put, Amazon doesn’t care for you. It’s a green desert. Unfit for human civilization.Take the example of Colonel Percy Harrison Fawcett. He wanted to make “the great discovery of the century” by finding the cryptic lost City of Z but instead, the uncaring Amazon rainforest consumed him, his son (Jack) and his son’s friend (Raleigh Rimell). So, “the great discovery of the century” became infamous as what has often been described as “the greatest exploration mystery of the twentieth century”— that is, the mystery of the fate of Percy Fawcett and the whereabouts of the lost City of Z.Many have tried to solve the mystery over the years, but failed.No one could find exactly what happened to Fawcett and certainly no one could find any clues that Z ever existed. But why should it exist? It was really pointless of us to assume right from the start that a civilization could prosper under something as brutal and vainglorious as Amazon. Sure, Grann did made some flimsy attempts by the end of the book by hinting that a civilized colony might have existed in the Amazon in the past, but that didn’t half-convince me.So, one thing I would definitely take away from this book is the fact that, Amazon is the bane of civilization."
185,0385513534,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5858699-kavita,4,"David Grann is a journalist, who got fascinated with the legend of Percy Fawcett, the Amazon explorer who disappeared into the Amazon in 1925, along with his son and his son's friend. Fawcett's obsession with an ancient and highly complex civilisation within the Amazon rainforest forms the basis of this book. Grann sets out to prove that Fawcett was right, and makes a journey into the Amazon himself.The Lost City of Z is basically a biography of Fawcett and concentrates on his quest for the legendary city that he called Z. I originally assumed that it was Grann's own journey into the Amazon which would be described here. There were short chapters in which he got ready to enter the forest, and since the story was not about it, it all turned out to be superficial. It would have been much better if Grann had concentrated solely on the Fawcett story.Interestingly, Grann quotes from the writings of Spanish conquistadors who had travelled the Amazon in the 1500s. Their descriptions varied from those of Fawcett, because by then, the local tribes had been wiped out massively and the region deforested. Grann's own journey showed yet more deforestation and extinction of life since the 1900s. Sadly, a few hundred years down the line, we might not have an Amazon rainforest left despite its vastness, so these accounts are valuable. The real appeal of the book, of course, lies in the fact that you can enjoy the deadly rainforest from the comfort of your couch. Not for us the risking of our lives and confronting snakes, mosquitoes, and other creatures of the rainforest, not to mention battling disease, hunger, and thirst. For us, the delight of expertly sliding into a beautiful world you can romanticise without really having to move a muscle. The Inferno Verde can become a Paraíso Verde."
186,0385513534,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39134508-kathleen,4,"This book was chosen by my book club as the non-fiction book for the month. I am hoping that it will qualify for a Bingo square - name of a city in the title ""Lost City of Z"". David Grann is a reporter and states at the beginning of the book that he isn't the type to get involved in the stories he works on and researches. Once he finishes a story he moves on to the next one. But like other adventurers, David did get caught up in the ""greatest exploration mystery of the twentieth century"" and set out to solve the story about the disappearance of British explorer Perry Faucett, and his son in the Amazon. What happened to them while they were searching for the Lost City of Z? This is a very informative and interesting non-fiction book that reads much like an Indiana Jones adventure story. David Grann expertly weaves geography, history and science together resulting in a breath-taking narrative. I listened to the audiobook of this story narrated by the talented Mark Deakins. He is one of my favourite narrators because he uses different voices for each character, and the voices seem to fit the character -bringing the story ""alive"". (I have read over 160 audio books and feel this audiobook enhanced my experience reading this book. If you are new to audio books, I think you should opt for reading this in print.)I highly recommend this non-fiction book for readers interested in history, explorations, and the Amazon."

188,0385513534,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2370826-dave-cullen,5,"Brilliant. This is a new classic of the narrative nonfiction genre.The prose is vivid and intoxicating, and he weaves together 2+ threads, seamlessly--with the Fawcett thread dominant, as it should be, yet given fresh life with the mingling of the contemporary thread.I was drawn in from the start, but oddly enough, I REALLY got fascinated when he got to the developing field of cultural anthropology, and the fights over whether the people in the Amazon were ""noble savages"" or just ""savages,"" or stupid subhumans, or . . . and what the apparent tiny population really meant. Throughout the book, there was an adventure story going on, but a much wider, deeper consideration of how the discoveries there fundamentally altered our conceptions of how and why we all are the way we are. And it crept into those ideas artfully, interestingly and never pedantically. It never bogged down into a university course: felt more like an exciting speaker spurring our curiosity and helping us run with it.So well done. I'll use this as one of my models for all my future books.(And as a writer, I can't resist saying: Great verbs! I mean, stupendously great, every page, every paragraph. Never too much, consistently just right.)"

190,0385513534,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1377720-deborah-edwards,5,"Do you remember the first time you saw ""Raiders of the Lost Ark?"" Because I do. In fact, I remember clearly that I didn't want to see it. The name sounded silly, and I had no clue what it was about. Visions of pirates and space creatures clouded my judgment. Luckily, my friends dragged me in by majority vote and I emerged from the theater two hours later, exhilarated, endlessly curious about early human cultures, and determined to live a more exciting life. And it stuck. Years later, I stood in the middle of Albuquerque receiving my degree in Anthropology, still consumed with a passion for learning about ancient human history and lost worlds. Percy Fawcett, the adventurer, explorer, and land surveyor at the heart of ""The Lost City of Z"" would have most likely seen a lot of himself in Indiana Jones. If ever there were a real-life version of the intrepid anthropologist, Fawcett would definitely be a frontrunner. And fate seemed to lead him there. In his early military years in Ceylon, Fawcett heard the legend of a lost city buried beneath an earthen mound near his base. He took it upon himself to try to locate this lost world, and appears to have had some success, although he did not have the wherewithal at the time to excavate it. Still, the thrill of the find and the desire to pursue other ""lost worlds"" grabbed hold of him then, and planted the seed of obsession that would follow him throughout the rest of his life. Working for the Royal Geographical Society, Fawcett was sent to the largely uncharted and dangerous forests of the Amazon. By many accounts, there seems to be no crueler environment in the world. When I was once contemplating graduate field work, I recalled the stories of an anthropologist who had visited our class to tell us about his work with the Yanamami, a tribe so fascinating and remote that many classmates later expressed their desire to do the same. But me? Not in the least. I knew the last place on earth I ever wanted to live - even for a short time - was within the bug-infested, snake-laden, vampire-bat heavy jaguar lair that is the Amazon. Mosquitoes love me here in New England. Imagine the feast I would provide them in the rain forest. I would be nearly bloodless in a week. But Fawcett, he was made for the place. Surveying the formerly unexplored (by white men) border between Brazil and Bolivia, he accomplished his mission nearly a year ahead of schedule. This despite losing half his team to disease, the arrows of hostile tribes, parasitic worms, viral infections, and starvation. By all accounts, Fawcett was impervious to disease, boasting a hardy constitution unphased by the rigors of a jungle so dense that a day's worth of hacking through it with machetes sometimes only gained the team a half a mile of advancement. His amazing physical stamina and seeming disdain for the suffering of others bred one of two things in the men who served him: intense loyalty or mutinous desire. The tales of both of these conditions in his many journeys back into the jungle after his acclaimed first mission, are the stuff of legend. But, somewhere along the way, Fawcett began to hear about a Lost City, much like the famed El Dorado, a city of vast palaces and towering pillars, filled with riches and covered in gold dust. Having encountered a smaller version of this phenomenon in Ceylon, Fawcett became intrigued. As time went on, intrigue turned to obsession, as more and more of the oral histories he encountered in the tribes he befriended, as well as the geographical and archaeological record that had newly been discovered began to substantiate the claims. When Hiram Bingham discovered Machu Picchu during the same time period as Fawcett's work, it only fueled his desire to find his own ""lost world."" ""The Lost City of Z"" is brilliantly told and exhaustively researched by David Grann. Needless to say, Fawcett's final mission involved a last ditch effort to find the city, taking only his grown son, his son's best friend and a couple of temporary native guides. They went into the forest in 1925 and were never heard from again. Since that time, literally hundreds of amateur explorers have trekked into the same hostile jungles to try to find the missing Colonel and his companions. As recently as 1995, a Bolivian businessman and his grown son (along with an expert team and the best technological aids) tried to finally find out what happened to the Fawcett team all those years ago, only to find themselves taken captive by an Amazonian tribe. (The tribe debated whether or not to kill them for three days until finally releasing them in exchange for their thirty thousand dollars worth of equipment.) And this was 1995 - not 1925. It is no wonder that Grann himself finally feels compelled to witness the land where Percy Fawcett was lost forever. His journey, which he documents late in the book, is far more eventful than I would have imagined, and his final meeting with the anthropologist Michael Hecklenberger, who has lived in the Amazon for over a dozen years now, was insightful and educational. For anyone who has ever felt the pull of exploration, imagined the thrill of a lost world, or even just really enjoyed the exploits of Indiana Jones, pick up this fascinating book. I doubt it will make you want to trek through the Amazon, (in fact, it may dissuade you from going to a jungle anywhere, ever, under any circumstances), but it might just make you want to explore a new culture, visit a museum, or even just take the long way home. And if it does, Percy Fawcett may have succeeded in some small way."
191,0385513534,http://goodreads.com/user/show/798978-barbara,5,"The story of ""Colonel"" Fawcett, and his explorations of the Amazon were once world known. Fawcett was searching for a legendary city in the jungle. He began his explorations in the 19th century. In the Victorian Age exploration was done by amateurs, and the field of anthropology was in its infancy. Fawcett's trips were financed by the Royal Geographic Society in London. Fawcett was relentless, driving his family into bankruptcy. On his final trip in 1925, he and his son, and a third man, disappeared.The descriptions of the explorations were hair raising. The insects were not only pests but dangerous. I won't go into detail but their effect on humans are disgusting. There was also danger from some the the warlike tribes, who as recently as the 1990's killed outsiders who wandered into their territory.The author Grann decides to investigate Fawcett and the ""lost city"". This book is mostly a report of Fawcett's life, and expeditions. He was famous not only for his numerous journeys, but his ability to form friendships with Amazon Indians, and his appreciation of their way of life. Grann himself travels to Brazil over a 100 years after Fawcett disappeared. This is a fascinating account, and one I found hard to put down."
192,0385513534,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1605591-christine,5,"	Shortly after I finished this book, the BBC World Service reported that a Brazilian man who advocated for small farmers, natives, and the rain forest was murdered. He was shot five times in the head while biking with his wife. The same report made reference to the 2005 killing of an American nun, a murder that Grann mentions in his book. What the news report drove home was the idea that the Amazon is still a dangerous place, just not exactly in the same way it was during Fawcett’s time. Instead of worrying about how a misunderstanding with a native tribe could end in the death of tribal members or of the group of explorers, the battle is now between business and various types of conversation. In many ways, a more violent battle, not just because everyone has guns.	This idea is not wholly examined in The Lost City of Z, though David Grann does touch on it in the closing chapters of his book, and the idea of the destruction of the natural world does run though a good portion of the book.	Much of the book is about Fawcett and his various trips to the Amazon; culminating in what was undoubtedly a fatal trip to find a “lost” city that he had named Z.	In fact, if you are going to learn anything from this book (and you are), the most important is the simple fact that if the natives tell you not to do something or go somewhere, LISTEN TO THEM! THEY KNOW FROM WHENCE THEY SPEAK!	(I’m using the slightly political incorrect term of natives because I am a good American who has been taught that Indian refers to a person from India. South American Native Americans is way too wordy, there too many tribes to list all the tribe names, and the term Native American or First People [nations:] would make me sound like the news anchor on CNN who referred to the African immigrants protesting/rioting in Paris a few years back as African-Americans.)	Fawcett was a man who spent more time in the Amazon then with his family. As an aside, Grann does a wonderful job of showing the strength of character of both Nina Fawcett and Grann’s own wife, making both women sound just as, if not more, heroic than their husbands. In fact, Mr. Grann, your wife sounds far more intelligent than you. (Sorry, don’t mean to offend, but she knew you needed more than sneakers before heading into the Amazon). The men who explored the Amazon seemed to have married very understand and supportive women (and, if possible, very rich women). While her husband was dealing with nasty bugs and a fish that could swim up his wee-wee, Nina Fawcett was giving birth to their second child, raising their first (eventually raising all three children), keeping house, and protecting her husband’s reputation, all of this on a rather limited budget.	To be far, Fawcett seemed to know that he was unworthy of her. This is what makes the book charming. It’s warts and all, and the people who have warts, know they have them. It’s very human.	Fawcett became convinced that there was lost civilization in the Amazon, basically a version of the city of gold myth. It was during an attempt to find this city that Fawcett, his eldest son Jack, and his son’s closest friend disappeared in the Amazon. The disappearance set off searches, rescue missions, and theories (such as this book), possibly resulting in another 100 deaths/disappearances.	Grann seems aware of his obsession and the risks it brings to both himself and his family. In fact, it seems like this is going to be his only big adventure. It seems he learned a lesson that Fawcett didn’t or couldn’t learn.	In some ways, the most interesting part of the book is the closing chapter which describes what a lost civilization in the Amazon is truly. Think the Incas, the Mayans, the Aztecs but in a different country. If the rain forest is turned wholly over to big business, if its defenders and supporters are murdered then not only do the flora and fauna of the Amazon disappear, not only do tribal cultures (if not whole tribes) die, but the Lost City of Z will still forever be lost."

While not really giving any sort of definitive answer to what happened to Percy Fawcett on his last expedition, the book was a wonderfully researched book on turn of the century amateur exploration and the competition that ensued between these gentleman rivals.While the final discovery was a great vindication of those explorers who felt that there had to be some sort of great civilization in the Amazon region, we are still not sure that Z has been or ever will be found.Nonetheless, this is one journey that I was happy to make with the author and am amazed at the treasure trove of new information he was able to provide everyone."

HOWEVER, I was pleasantly surprised that the book also gave me a sense of early 20th popular culture.

196,0385513534,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35799-amy,4,"Colonel Percy Harrison Fawcett was quite a famous explorer in his day. The last of the ""great Victorian explorers"", he inspired the creation of Indiana Jones (and quite possibly Commander McBragg). He was as well known at the time as Dr. Livingstone, and had a reputation of being indestructible. He became obsessed with El Dorado, the mythical (?) city of gold, which he also referred to as Z. In 1925, he took his oldest son and one of his son's friends on an expedition into the jungles of Brazil to find it. They were never seen again outside of the Amazon. Over the course of the next decades, dozens of expeditions set out to find the Fawcett party, or traces of it, including other famous explorers of the time, an actor who had played an explorer (!), and Fawcett's younger son Brian. Some of them were also lost. In addition, many people died just looking for El Dorado. More modern science concluded that no complex civilization could have endured in the Amazon, in so hostile an environment.This book tells the story of Fawcett and traces this final expedition. The author even traveled to Brazil himself to try to follow Fawcett's last trail and try to find out what exactly happened to him. (When he reached one point where Fawcett had been in the jungle, he said that it looked ""like Nebraska"" now - deforestation is real.) Using Fawcett's private notes from previous trips that the family shared with him, as well as dispatches from his final one, Grann was able to find the spot where he thought they had started from (Fawcett had said one thing in his public notes for the Royal Geographic Society, to keep the exact location confidential because other explorers were out there looking. But Grann found another set of coordinates in Fawcett's private notes).I don't know anything about this man or his expeditions, but it seems to me that Grann has helped answer some of the questions that surrounded him. And maybe the Amazon isn't as hostile to agriculture and society as previously thought?On the other hand.... it is pretty much just waiting to kill you so I don't recommend trying it."
197,0385513534,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1758594-patrick-gibson,4,"This author was on the Colbert show a few nights ago. Even though Steven wouldn’t give the poor guy a chance to talk, the story seemed right up my alley so I picked up the book the next day. Isn’t that why authors appear on talk shows, so that numb-nuts like me will rush to Borders?Percy Harrison Fawcett was the real-life explorer whose adventures Arthur Conan Doyle drew upon for his 1912 novel ‘The Lost Word.’ While Fawcett did not find a South American plateau populated with dinosaurs, he did lead numerous expeditions looking for lost civilizations. On his last and most ambitious—seeking the City of Z—he vanished. Over the past seventy-five years there have been hundreds of other expeditions into the Amazon, by a myriad of adventurers, looking for Percy Fawcett. All failed. Hundreds died. Many were never heard from again.Fawcett marked the end of an age. He was the last of the individualist explores. The day of the airplane, the radio, the organized and heavily financed modern expedition had not arrived. With him, it was the heroic story of a man against a vast uncharted wilderness nearly the size of the continental United States inhabited by deadly warriors.Armed with newly discovered information found in a trunk by one of Fawcett’s grandchildren the author, after completing exhaustive research, decides to enter the Amazon and follow the path of Fawcett’s last journey. This is a little eye-brow lifting because the author is a middle aged slightly chunky New Yorker who is the complete opposite of the rigorously trained, physically fit, handsome Fawcett. Thus the consequence of obsession, I guess.Throughout the nineteenth century there was a tremendous speculation concerning the ‘lesser’ civilizations and their inability to reach a level of sophistication beyond living in huts and foraging for food. Darwin did nothing to dispel this attitude—in fact, augmented it. Fawcett was unique in his vision and belief that remote jungle societies could indeed build out of stone, decipher the movements of the stars and create a written language. Without any concrete knowledge of its existence, he was determined to find proof, in the form of a magnificent stone city—he called Z—in the blank parts of the Amazon maps.For Fawcett’s final, and according to him ‘definitive’ 1925 excursion, instead of a group of hunter/explorers, he took only his twenty-one year old son Jack, and Jack’s companion Raleigh Rimell (who really wanted to go to Hollywood and become a silent movie star). For a while the trio sent native runners out of the jungle with progress reports. Their messages would be telegraphed to cities in the United States and eventually newspapers around the world published accounts of their progress. The world literally followed their escapades like a serial novel. Then everything stopped. And the world went nuts. Every major geographical society mounted rescue parties. Finding Fawcett Fever lasted for years. Even in the 1950’s there were rumors Fawcett was still alive and lording like a king over a remote tribe. In the 1960’s, rescue parties were mounted and sent into the wilds. More people died searching for Fawcett than looking for the headwaters of the Nile or panning gold in the Pacific northwest. It’s a pretty amazing story and a whopping good read. The author knows how to pace his story and exactly the right time to intersperse details of his own trek though the tropical forest.I have always wondered about these curious lines from ‘Othello”:And of the Cannibals that each other eat,The Anthropophagi, and men whose headsDo grow beneath their shoulders.It comes from an idea Shakespeare borrowed from Sir Walter Raleigh writing about Francisco de Orellana, whose expedition into the Amazon vanished in 1542. One of the many Christian xenophobes who contributed to slavery in the Western hemisphere. (Raleigh, not Shakespeare.)The author doesn’t have an ending and the story looses its momentum towards the end, but it is an intriguing story, well researched and a very interesting read. Completely enjoyable."

I liked the format with the biographical and historical information interspersed with the authors research in libraries and archives, and shopping trips to adventure outfitters. How had I never heard of the Fawcett mystery until now? It seems like a story ripe for Hollywood or various adventure stories, so it is a wonder that it took this long to have some quality research on the topic (or have I just been ignorant of this?) Interesting aside - as I was reading this, my husband is reading Candice Millard's *River of Doubt* about Roosevelt's travels in Amazon. It was intriguing to hear the Grann citing that book, and for my husband and I to discuss the two expeditions and how they differed. I look forward to reading that book soon to continue my own little obsession with rainforest adventure stories...This book describes a very different Amazon than the one I encountered on my trip to Peru in 2007 - of course, I was not in the deepest darkest part of the forest, but we were ""roughing it"" by a lot of standards... I guess that is because over the last century there have been significant strides in public health and sanitation, disease prevention, and research on tropical climes... even in the author's travels in 2006 and 2007, he describes a very different Brazilian rainforest than Fawcett encountered 80 years prior. This alone causes some concern that things can change so significantly in the relatively short span of years..."

The upshot is still that no one knows what happened, despite numerous attempts by numerous people to find out. The book ends with a short description of recent archaeological discoveries in the region that have uncovered much larger population centers and could have given rise to stories about an El Dorado or Z.That's it.

The three men never returned and a legend was born.Over the years hundreds of would be rescuers and explorers have attempted to learn the fate of the last Fawcett expedition and/or discover Fawcett's fabled city.Grann joins their ranks and determines to journey there himself, leaving a wife and newborn son in New York City, to try to find the truth.There are two perfectly blended journey's here. Grann takes a ""no apologies"" approach in his exploration of Fawcett's life. We meet the tireless, obsessed explorer, negligent father and husband and the aggressive, easily offended bully who called anyone who couldn't match his 10 mile treks through unexplored jungle a ""coward."" Fawcett was certainly a thoroughly unlikable person but, as Grann takes pains to point out, its impossible to ignore his strength, dedication and intelligence. He changed the more time he spent in the Amazon among the tribes that lived there. He came to question the Victorian ""make the world England"" approach that was playing the same role the Spanish had years earlier in killing, subjugating and erasing the people who had thrived there for a thousand years. He fought bitterly against his own nature and that of his country to argue that ""savage"" was an abhorrent term perhaps best used to describe those attempting to ""civilize"" a people far beyond them already.Then we have Grann who through his own journey to the Amazon comes to understand that for all Fawcett's successes he lost site of those closest to him, those who needed him and depended upon him. He realizes that he too has become so blind to everything but this quest that he's abandoned his own family without a second thought.So yes, this is a book about crazy amazing adventures and secrets in the jungle and its amazingly exciting and so much fun to listen to at night right before bed. It really is like Indiana Jones comes to life (hell there's apparently an Indiana Jones novel ABOUT Fawcett and his city) but its also about what we lose when we put dreams ahead of everything else. Subtle and heart stopping. A nice combo it turns out."
206,0385513534,http://goodreads.com/user/show/83144-el,4,"I love a good yarn. I love those crazy stories about hidden treasures, travels to the ends of the earth, and driving obsessions - the more real they are, the better.In the Twenties, explorer Percy Fawcett wandered into the jungles of the Amazon to find the Lost City of Z, aka the ancient civilization, El Dorado. He was obsessed with the concept of this hidden civilization, and spent years researching and studying before embarking on his journey. But what happened? We know that most of his team died along the way, and that he sent his then 21-year-old son back home. But then the story ends basically, because Fawcett never made it out of the jungle. Was he driven to death by his own obsession? Was he eaten by a ginormous snake? Did he find the Lost City of Z and decide to just hang there for the rest of his days? David Grann picks up the story by not necessarily answering those questions, but by trying to follow in Fawcett's footsteps. Well... without that pesky ""getting-lost-in-the-Amazon-and-probably-dying"" thing.This is an engrossing story and totally fulfilled the wannabe archeologist I have inside, all the while reminding me that I would never last in the Amazon. It's hot, it's humid, there are bugs I've never even imagined (and I'm not being especially girly - I'm talking about mosquitoes that suck the juice off your eyeballs or those annoying things that basically get inside your junk and can not be removed), vampire bats, and did I mention the humidity? Yeah, it's not really a place that I could call home, but Fawcett apparently could, and Grann sure as heck could at least hang with the best of them. More power to those guys.Still, the bouncing back and forth between Grann's own expedition and that of Fawcett's was distracting at times. It would have been better if Grann just took one storyline and ran with it as they are singularly pretty fascinating. But Grann did a decent job of finding primary sources to back his (and Fawcett's) claims. My list of books to hunt down now has increased exponentially, and I suppose I can thank Grann for that, though I think it has more to do with the absolute craziness that possessed Fawcett that makes me want to know more about him."
207,0385513534,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4026072-kim,4,"I love travel and adventure and ancient civiliations so a real-life journey is a must-read for me. It is amazing how many people had invested time, money and, in some cases, their lives to search for a group that people said shouldn't have gone in the first place. Maybe if those people had helped fund the expedition they wouldn't have gone missing. Or as some conspiracies say maybe he wanted to go missing.But there's a part of me that would have also wanted to rush out looking for him. And that's the part that believes in the lost city of Z. Not the city of gold or the gilded man but the ancient civilization of the Amazon. The people and cities the original European explorers reported that were never seen again. And which science and archaeologists are finally confirming as being real. I would love to join the digs in South America, maybe one day I will.So why only 4 stars? The book is too short. I know it was originally written as an article and then extended but it was over too quick. I was really getting into the story and the discoveries when it finished. Now I'll have to find more books on the subject."

Grann's descriptions of all the horrible ways the Amazon can invade the body make me never want to stand in a forest again. However, the book did end on a good note: in awe of the great unknown civilizations that not only survive but thrived in the Amazon. I also found Grann's portrayal of the individuals that journeyed into the Amazon (and the people they left behind) interesting enough in themselves. What kind of people are compelled again and again to enter into a lonely hell? "

210,0385513534,http://goodreads.com/user/show/869064-jeremy,3,"This is kind of an odd accomplishment: an adventure book that will make you really really glad your not an adventurer. Grann's descriptions of Fawcett et al trampling through the amazonian rainforest with their crass, (often racist) imperialist delusions of grandeur and discovery are often gut-wrenching. Skin peels off in sheets, everyone gets malaria, parasites, maggot infections (shudder), gangrene, etc. Trekking through unspoiled tropical jungles is utterly horrifying, you basically just turn yourself into an oozing, walking meal and wait for the rainforest to literally devour you. Grann remains fairly non-judgmental through out. After all, it's the green hell of the jungle itself which finally breaks down and destroys hubris and good intentions alike. Seriously, some of this stuff would make Werner Herzog blush."

For most of the book I thought Percy Fawcett (the explorer whom the book is about) was probably a complete wack-a-doodle. At the end of the book, maybe only partially a wack-a-doodle but you do have to be somewhat obsessed to keep going back into that environment looking for a fabled ""Lost City"". I cannot fathom trekking into the Amazon jungle in our times with modern technology let alone in the 1920's when Fawcett did it. It is not a place I would ever desire to experience, just on the bug issue alone! Gross stuff in there!! The book is a bit long in places but overall pretty good.(Why is GR marking everything as read twice when it's only been read once?). Maddening!"

The author also has a new non-fiction book to be published in April, 2017: Killers of the Flower Moon. My original review:: ""This is a very readable, well researched book. It focuses on explorer Colonel Percy Fawcett, and his obsession to find a great. ancient city deep in the Amazon jungle which he called Z. Z ,if it existed, may have given rise to the legend of El Dorado. The book tells the story of Fawcett's quests, and of the author attempting to journey to the Amazon to try to solve some of the mystery around Fawcett's mysterious disappearance on his 1925 expedition.  Anyone interested in early 20th century exploration and past and present day Amazonia should enjoy this book. Prior to his ill-fated journey, Fawcett had explored the Amazon several times before. He was an arrogant man, rarely getting along with those who accompanied him on his journeys. He seemed immune to most tropical illnesses and scorned those who became ill or couldn't keep up to his break-neck pace, regarding them as weak. His obsession to find Z bordered on madness as he consulted spiritualists. The author found that his papers showed ever increasing bizarre beliefs. For his last journey he advertised for strong men to accompany him (no women allowed). A large number of scientists, explorers, athletes and people wanting adventure or just wishing to get just away from home replied. Among those turned down was Lawrence of Arabia . Fawcett felt that a person used to the desert would never keep up to him in the jungle. Instead he decided to go accompanied by his 21 year old son and the son's best friend.  As Fawcett was very secretive, not wanting any rival explorer to find Z before he did, his exact route was unknown or sometimes written in code. The disappearance of Fawcett and the two young men caused a sensation, and countless people also vanished or died searching for them.It also tells the stories of other explorers in the early part half of the 1800's. These adventurers have now been replaced by archaeologists and anthropologists. Grann discovers in his journey a ruins which may have led to the legend of Z which is now being studied and excavated, and he believes he knows the fate of Fawcett and the two young men from stories passed on by several Indian tribes."""
214,0385513534,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6969151-veeral,4,"That obnoxious Amazon. It likes to monopolize and dominate the jungle. Although one might be led to believe that there would be an abundance of everything where such a mighty force exists, the truth is exactly the opposite. As David Grann puts it himself: It’s the great “counterfeit paradise”. I couldn’t agree more. Amazon will starve you. Amazon will desiccate you. And finally, Amazon will obliterate you. Because, simply put, Amazon doesn’t care for you. It’s a green desert. Unfit for human civilization.Take the example of Colonel Percy Harrison Fawcett. He wanted to make “the great discovery of the century” by finding the cryptic lost City of Z but instead, the uncaring Amazon rainforest consumed him, his son (Jack) and his son’s friend (Raleigh Rimell). So, “the great discovery of the century” became infamous as what has often been described as “the greatest exploration mystery of the twentieth century”— that is, the mystery of the fate of Percy Fawcett and the whereabouts of the lost City of Z.Many have tried to solve the mystery over the years, but failed.No one could find exactly what happened to Fawcett and certainly no one could find any clues that Z ever existed. But why should it exist? It was really pointless of us to assume right from the start that a civilization could prosper under something as brutal and vainglorious as Amazon. Sure, Grann did made some flimsy attempts by the end of the book by hinting that a civilized colony might have existed in the Amazon in the past, but that didn’t half-convince me.So, one thing I would definitely take away from this book is the fact that, Amazon is the bane of civilization."
215,0385513534,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5858699-kavita,4,"David Grann is a journalist, who got fascinated with the legend of Percy Fawcett, the Amazon explorer who disappeared into the Amazon in 1925, along with his son and his son's friend. Fawcett's obsession with an ancient and highly complex civilisation within the Amazon rainforest forms the basis of this book. Grann sets out to prove that Fawcett was right, and makes a journey into the Amazon himself.The Lost City of Z is basically a biography of Fawcett and concentrates on his quest for the legendary city that he called Z. I originally assumed that it was Grann's own journey into the Amazon which would be described here. There were short chapters in which he got ready to enter the forest, and since the story was not about it, it all turned out to be superficial. It would have been much better if Grann had concentrated solely on the Fawcett story.Interestingly, Grann quotes from the writings of Spanish conquistadors who had travelled the Amazon in the 1500s. Their descriptions varied from those of Fawcett, because by then, the local tribes had been wiped out massively and the region deforested. Grann's own journey showed yet more deforestation and extinction of life since the 1900s. Sadly, a few hundred years down the line, we might not have an Amazon rainforest left despite its vastness, so these accounts are valuable. The real appeal of the book, of course, lies in the fact that you can enjoy the deadly rainforest from the comfort of your couch. Not for us the risking of our lives and confronting snakes, mosquitoes, and other creatures of the rainforest, not to mention battling disease, hunger, and thirst. For us, the delight of expertly sliding into a beautiful world you can romanticise without really having to move a muscle. The Inferno Verde can become a Paraíso Verde."
216,0385513534,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39134508-kathleen,4,"This book was chosen by my book club as the non-fiction book for the month. I am hoping that it will qualify for a Bingo square - name of a city in the title ""Lost City of Z"". David Grann is a reporter and states at the beginning of the book that he isn't the type to get involved in the stories he works on and researches. Once he finishes a story he moves on to the next one. But like other adventurers, David did get caught up in the ""greatest exploration mystery of the twentieth century"" and set out to solve the story about the disappearance of British explorer Perry Faucett, and his son in the Amazon. What happened to them while they were searching for the Lost City of Z? This is a very informative and interesting non-fiction book that reads much like an Indiana Jones adventure story. David Grann expertly weaves geography, history and science together resulting in a breath-taking narrative. I listened to the audiobook of this story narrated by the talented Mark Deakins. He is one of my favourite narrators because he uses different voices for each character, and the voices seem to fit the character -bringing the story ""alive"". (I have read over 160 audio books and feel this audiobook enhanced my experience reading this book. If you are new to audio books, I think you should opt for reading this in print.)I highly recommend this non-fiction book for readers interested in history, explorations, and the Amazon."

This is a new classic of the narrative nonfiction genre.The prose is vivid and intoxicating, and he weaves together 2+ threads, seamlessly--with the Fawcett thread dominant, as it should be, yet given fresh life with the mingling of the contemporary thread.I was drawn in from the start, but oddly enough, I REALLY got fascinated when he got to the developing field of cultural anthropology, and the fights over whether the people in the Amazon were ""noble savages"" or just ""savages,"" or stupid subhumans, or . . . and what the apparent tiny population really meant. Throughout the book, there was an adventure story going on, but a much wider, deeper consideration of how the discoveries there fundamentally altered our conceptions of how and why we all are the way we are. And it crept into those ideas artfully, interestingly and never pedantically. It never bogged down into a university course: felt more like an exciting speaker spurring our curiosity and helping us run with it.So well done. I'll use this as one of my models for all my future books.(And as a writer, I can't resist saying: Great verbs! I mean, stupendously great, every page, every paragraph.

In fact, I remember clearly that I didn't want to see it. The name sounded silly, and I had no clue what it was about. Visions of pirates and space creatures clouded my judgment. Luckily, my friends dragged me in by majority vote and I emerged from the theater two hours later, exhilarated, endlessly curious about early human cultures, and determined to live a more exciting life. And it stuck. Years later, I stood in the middle of Albuquerque receiving my degree in Anthropology, still consumed with a passion for learning about ancient human history and lost worlds. Percy Fawcett, the adventurer, explorer, and land surveyor at the heart of ""The Lost City of Z"" would have most likely seen a lot of himself in Indiana Jones. If ever there were a real-life version of the intrepid anthropologist, Fawcett would definitely be a frontrunner. And fate seemed to lead him there. In his early military years in Ceylon, Fawcett heard the legend of a lost city buried beneath an earthen mound near his base. He took it upon himself to try to locate this lost world, and appears to have had some success, although he did not have the wherewithal at the time to excavate it. Still, the thrill of the find and the desire to pursue other ""lost worlds"" grabbed hold of him then, and planted the seed of obsession that would follow him throughout the rest of his life. Working for the Royal Geographical Society, Fawcett was sent to the largely uncharted and dangerous forests of the Amazon. By many accounts, there seems to be no crueler environment in the world. When I was once contemplating graduate field work, I recalled the stories of an anthropologist who had visited our class to tell us about his work with the Yanamami, a tribe so fascinating and remote that many classmates later expressed their desire to do the same. But me? Not in the least. I knew the last place on earth I ever wanted to live - even for a short time - was within the bug-infested, snake-laden, vampire-bat heavy jaguar lair that is the Amazon. Mosquitoes love me here in New England. Imagine the feast I would provide them in the rain forest. I would be nearly bloodless in a week. But Fawcett, he was made for the place. Surveying the formerly unexplored (by white men) border between Brazil and Bolivia, he accomplished his mission nearly a year ahead of schedule. This despite losing half his team to disease, the arrows of hostile tribes, parasitic worms, viral infections, and starvation. By all accounts, Fawcett was impervious to disease, boasting a hardy constitution unphased by the rigors of a jungle so dense that a day's worth of hacking through it with machetes sometimes only gained the team a half a mile of advancement. His amazing physical stamina and seeming disdain for the suffering of others bred one of two things in the men who served him: intense loyalty or mutinous desire. The tales of both of these conditions in his many journeys back into the jungle after his acclaimed first mission, are the stuff of legend. But, somewhere along the way, Fawcett began to hear about a Lost City, much like the famed El Dorado, a city of vast palaces and towering pillars, filled with riches and covered in gold dust. Having encountered a smaller version of this phenomenon in Ceylon, Fawcett became intrigued. As time went on, intrigue turned to obsession, as more and more of the oral histories he encountered in the tribes he befriended, as well as the geographical and archaeological record that had newly been discovered began to substantiate the claims. When Hiram Bingham discovered Machu Picchu during the same time period as Fawcett's work, it only fueled his desire to find his own ""lost world."" ""The Lost City of Z"" is brilliantly told and exhaustively researched by David Grann. Needless to say, Fawcett's final mission involved a last ditch effort to find the city, taking only his grown son, his son's best friend and a couple of temporary native guides. They went into the forest in 1925 and were never heard from again. Since that time, literally hundreds of amateur explorers have trekked into the same hostile jungles to try to find the missing Colonel and his companions. As recently as 1995, a Bolivian businessman and his grown son (along with an expert team and the best technological aids) tried to finally find out what happened to the Fawcett team all those years ago, only to find themselves taken captive by an Amazonian tribe. (The tribe debated whether or not to kill them for three days until finally releasing them in exchange for their thirty thousand dollars worth of equipment.) And this was 1995 - not 1925. It is no wonder that Grann himself finally feels compelled to witness the land where Percy Fawcett was lost forever. His journey, which he documents late in the book, is far more eventful than I would have imagined, and his final meeting with the anthropologist Michael Hecklenberger, who has lived in the Amazon for over a dozen years now, was insightful and educational. For anyone who has ever felt the pull of exploration, imagined the thrill of a lost world, or even just really enjoyed the exploits of Indiana Jones, pick up this fascinating book. I doubt it will make you want to trek through the Amazon, (in fact, it may dissuade you from going to a jungle anywhere, ever, under any circumstances), but it might just make you want to explore a new culture, visit a museum, or even just take the long way home. And if it does, Percy Fawcett may have succeeded in some small way."
221,0385513534,http://goodreads.com/user/show/798978-barbara,5,"The story of ""Colonel"" Fawcett, and his explorations of the Amazon were once world known. Fawcett was searching for a legendary city in the jungle. He began his explorations in the 19th century. In the Victorian Age exploration was done by amateurs, and the field of anthropology was in its infancy. Fawcett's trips were financed by the Royal Geographic Society in London. Fawcett was relentless, driving his family into bankruptcy. On his final trip in 1925, he and his son, and a third man, disappeared.The descriptions of the explorations were hair raising. The insects were not only pests but dangerous. I won't go into detail but their effect on humans are disgusting. There was also danger from some the the warlike tribes, who as recently as the 1990's killed outsiders who wandered into their territory.The author Grann decides to investigate Fawcett and the ""lost city"". This book is mostly a report of Fawcett's life, and expeditions. He was famous not only for his numerous journeys, but his ability to form friendships with Amazon Indians, and his appreciation of their way of life. Grann himself travels to Brazil over a 100 years after Fawcett disappeared. This is a fascinating account, and one I found hard to put down."
222,0385513534,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1605591-christine,5,"	Shortly after I finished this book, the BBC World Service reported that a Brazilian man who advocated for small farmers, natives, and the rain forest was murdered. He was shot five times in the head while biking with his wife. The same report made reference to the 2005 killing of an American nun, a murder that Grann mentions in his book. What the news report drove home was the idea that the Amazon is still a dangerous place, just not exactly in the same way it was during Fawcett’s time. Instead of worrying about how a misunderstanding with a native tribe could end in the death of tribal members or of the group of explorers, the battle is now between business and various types of conversation. In many ways, a more violent battle, not just because everyone has guns.	This idea is not wholly examined in The Lost City of Z, though David Grann does touch on it in the closing chapters of his book, and the idea of the destruction of the natural world does run though a good portion of the book.	Much of the book is about Fawcett and his various trips to the Amazon; culminating in what was undoubtedly a fatal trip to find a “lost” city that he had named Z.	In fact, if you are going to learn anything from this book (and you are), the most important is the simple fact that if the natives tell you not to do something or go somewhere, LISTEN TO THEM! THEY KNOW FROM WHENCE THEY SPEAK!	(I’m using the slightly political incorrect term of natives because I am a good American who has been taught that Indian refers to a person from India. South American Native Americans is way too wordy, there too many tribes to list all the tribe names, and the term Native American or First People [nations:] would make me sound like the news anchor on CNN who referred to the African immigrants protesting/rioting in Paris a few years back as African-Americans.)	Fawcett was a man who spent more time in the Amazon then with his family. As an aside, Grann does a wonderful job of showing the strength of character of both Nina Fawcett and Grann’s own wife, making both women sound just as, if not more, heroic than their husbands. In fact, Mr. Grann, your wife sounds far more intelligent than you. (Sorry, don’t mean to offend, but she knew you needed more than sneakers before heading into the Amazon). The men who explored the Amazon seemed to have married very understand and supportive women (and, if possible, very rich women). While her husband was dealing with nasty bugs and a fish that could swim up his wee-wee, Nina Fawcett was giving birth to their second child, raising their first (eventually raising all three children), keeping house, and protecting her husband’s reputation, all of this on a rather limited budget.	To be far, Fawcett seemed to know that he was unworthy of her. This is what makes the book charming. It’s warts and all, and the people who have warts, know they have them. It’s very human.	Fawcett became convinced that there was lost civilization in the Amazon, basically a version of the city of gold myth. It was during an attempt to find this city that Fawcett, his eldest son Jack, and his son’s closest friend disappeared in the Amazon. The disappearance set off searches, rescue missions, and theories (such as this book), possibly resulting in another 100 deaths/disappearances.	Grann seems aware of his obsession and the risks it brings to both himself and his family. In fact, it seems like this is going to be his only big adventure. It seems he learned a lesson that Fawcett didn’t or couldn’t learn.	In some ways, the most interesting part of the book is the closing chapter which describes what a lost civilization in the Amazon is truly. Think the Incas, the Mayans, the Aztecs but in a different country. If the rain forest is turned wholly over to big business, if its defenders and supporters are murdered then not only do the flora and fauna of the Amazon disappear, not only do tribal cultures (if not whole tribes) die, but the Lost City of Z will still forever be lost."

While not really giving any sort of definitive answer to what happened to Percy Fawcett on his last expedition, the book was a wonderfully researched book on turn of the century amateur exploration and the competition that ensued between these gentleman rivals.While the final discovery was a great vindication of those explorers who felt that there had to be some sort of great civilization in the Amazon region, we are still not sure that Z has been or ever will be found.Nonetheless, this is one journey that I was happy to make with the author and am amazed at the treasure trove of new information he was able to provide everyone."

226,0385513534,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35799-amy,4,"Colonel Percy Harrison Fawcett was quite a famous explorer in his day. The last of the ""great Victorian explorers"", he inspired the creation of Indiana Jones (and quite possibly Commander McBragg). He was as well known at the time as Dr. Livingstone, and had a reputation of being indestructible. He became obsessed with El Dorado, the mythical (?) city of gold, which he also referred to as Z. In 1925, he took his oldest son and one of his son's friends on an expedition into the jungles of Brazil to find it. They were never seen again outside of the Amazon. Over the course of the next decades, dozens of expeditions set out to find the Fawcett party, or traces of it, including other famous explorers of the time, an actor who had played an explorer (!), and Fawcett's younger son Brian. Some of them were also lost. In addition, many people died just looking for El Dorado. More modern science concluded that no complex civilization could have endured in the Amazon, in so hostile an environment.This book tells the story of Fawcett and traces this final expedition. The author even traveled to Brazil himself to try to follow Fawcett's last trail and try to find out what exactly happened to him. (When he reached one point where Fawcett had been in the jungle, he said that it looked ""like Nebraska"" now - deforestation is real.) Using Fawcett's private notes from previous trips that the family shared with him, as well as dispatches from his final one, Grann was able to find the spot where he thought they had started from (Fawcett had said one thing in his public notes for the Royal Geographic Society, to keep the exact location confidential because other explorers were out there looking. But Grann found another set of coordinates in Fawcett's private notes).I don't know anything about this man or his expeditions, but it seems to me that Grann has helped answer some of the questions that surrounded him. And maybe the Amazon isn't as hostile to agriculture and society as previously thought?On the other hand.... it is pretty much just waiting to kill you so I don't recommend trying it."

On his last and most ambitious—seeking the City of Z—he vanished. Over the past seventy-five years there have been hundreds of other expeditions into the Amazon, by a myriad of adventurers, looking for Percy Fawcett. All failed. Hundreds died. Many were never heard from again.Fawcett marked the end of an age. He was the last of the individualist explores. The day of the airplane, the radio, the organized and heavily financed modern expedition had not arrived. With him, it was the heroic story of a man against a vast uncharted wilderness nearly the size of the continental United States inhabited by deadly warriors.Armed with newly discovered information found in a trunk by one of Fawcett’s grandchildren the author, after completing exhaustive research, decides to enter the Amazon and follow the path of Fawcett’s last journey. This is a little eye-brow lifting because the author is a middle aged slightly chunky New Yorker who is the complete opposite of the rigorously trained, physically fit, handsome Fawcett. Thus the consequence of obsession, I guess.Throughout the nineteenth century there was a tremendous speculation concerning the ‘lesser’ civilizations and their inability to reach a level of sophistication beyond living in huts and foraging for food. Darwin did nothing to dispel this attitude—in fact, augmented it. Fawcett was unique in his vision and belief that remote jungle societies could indeed build out of stone, decipher the movements of the stars and create a written language. Without any concrete knowledge of its existence, he was determined to find proof, in the form of a magnificent stone city—he called Z—in the blank parts of the Amazon maps.For Fawcett’s final, and according to him ‘definitive’ 1925 excursion, instead of a group of hunter/explorers, he took only his twenty-one year old son Jack, and Jack’s companion Raleigh Rimell (who really wanted to go to Hollywood and become a silent movie star). For a while the trio sent native runners out of the jungle with progress reports. Their messages would be telegraphed to cities in the United States and eventually newspapers around the world published accounts of their progress. The world literally followed their escapades like a serial novel. Then everything stopped. And the world went nuts. Every major geographical society mounted rescue parties. Finding Fawcett Fever lasted for years. Even in the 1950’s there were rumors Fawcett was still alive and lording like a king over a remote tribe. In the 1960’s, rescue parties were mounted and sent into the wilds. More people died searching for Fawcett than looking for the headwaters of the Nile or panning gold in the Pacific northwest. It’s a pretty amazing story and a whopping good read. The author knows how to pace his story and exactly the right time to intersperse details of his own trek though the tropical forest.I have always wondered about these curious lines from ‘Othello”:And of the Cannibals that each other eat,The Anthropophagi, and men whose headsDo grow beneath their shoulders.It comes from an idea Shakespeare borrowed from Sir Walter Raleigh writing about Francisco de Orellana, whose expedition into the Amazon vanished in 1542. One of the many Christian xenophobes who contributed to slavery in the Western hemisphere. (Raleigh, not Shakespeare.)The author doesn’t have an ending and the story looses its momentum towards the end, but it is an intriguing story, well researched and a very interesting read. Completely enjoyable."

That is, talking about sales forecasts, writing up spread sheets and cursing Excel when I couldn't copy/paste from one cell to another, and being encouraged to think of ways I could improve the company while knowing I could be laid off at any minute. All so common, and all such a snore. Now, even my exciting life in Italy is still tedious at times, albeit for different reasons.Then a book like this comes along to rip us out of the goddamn delirium of every day life. This is the true story of when men were men and the world was a place to be explored and conquered so that the blank places on maps could be filled in and the Queen could get a few more jewels in her crown. The ballsiest of all explorers, Percy Fawcett, thought that hiking through the Amazon in a search for the legendary city of El Dorado was a good way to spend his time. KICK ASS. And there's even more fun here: swarming mosquitoes that carry disease, small catfish that like to lodge themselves IN the anus or urethra and can only be removed by surgery, blood-sucking bats, disease, parasites, and Indians in the bush just waiting to shoot you with poison arrows and shrink your head, sell it to collectors, and have it turn up in a pawn shop in Vegas. WICKED! Fawcett's eventual disappearance and the likelihood that an ancient, advanced civilization thrived in the Amazon and was wiped out by conquistadors are sobering reminders that this incredible story is as true as it gets. This book is a mystery, an adventure tale, and travelogue all rolled into one fly-through read. And it's the kind of thing that makes spreadsheets, the 9 to 5 drill, and even Excel, bearable. KICKED ASS. READ IT! "
229,0385513534,http://goodreads.com/user/show/595788-alex-telander,5,"In 1925 one of the world’s last explorers, Percy Fawcett, traveled into the heart of the Amazon jungle with his son for his last expedition in search of a lost civilization. It was a worldwide publicized event, with Fawcett writing journal entries and having a messenger take them to the nearest large town to be sent via telegraph to the rest of the world. Then the entries suddenly stopped and Fawcett was never heard from again. Expeditions were made to discover what happened to them; nothing was ever found, while some more people were lost to the Amazon. The Lost City of Z is the story of Percy Fawcett, his life and how he became a great explorer, and where his obsession for the Amazon came from. It is also the story of the mystery of this doomed last expedition, and all the efforts – some ending in tragedy – that have been made since then.David Grann is a staff writer for the New Yorker who first found out about Percy Fawcett while researching an article on the mysterious death of the world’s foremost Sherlock Holmes expert. The Lost City of Z takes Grann all over the world, from visiting Fawcett’s great granddaughter and seeing some of his original journal entries, to putting together his own expedition to find out what really happened to Percy Fawcett. The Lost City of Z is the incredible story of one of the last explorers, but it is also the story of the strength of the human spirit and it’s drive to never give up. Percy Fawcett was a real life Indiana Jones and this is his fascinating story.Originally written on February 9th 2010 ©Alex C. Telander.For more reviews and author interviews, go to Bookbanter.net"

I liked the format with the biographical and historical information interspersed with the authors research in libraries and archives, and shopping trips to adventure outfitters. How had I never heard of the Fawcett mystery until now? It seems like a story ripe for Hollywood or various adventure stories, so it is a wonder that it took this long to have some quality research on the topic (or have I just been ignorant of this?) Interesting aside - as I was reading this, my husband is reading Candice Millard's *River of Doubt* about Roosevelt's travels in Amazon. It was intriguing to hear the Grann citing that book, and for my husband and I to discuss the two expeditions and how they differed. I look forward to reading that book soon to continue my own little obsession with rainforest adventure stories...This book describes a very different Amazon than the one I encountered on my trip to Peru in 2007 - of course, I was not in the deepest darkest part of the forest, but we were ""roughing it"" by a lot of standards... I guess that is because over the last century there have been significant strides in public health and sanitation, disease prevention, and research on tropical climes... even in the author's travels in 2006 and 2007, he describes a very different Brazilian rainforest than Fawcett encountered 80 years prior. This alone causes some concern that things can change so significantly in the relatively short span of years..."

Fawcett's British colonial background, his early years, other explorations, his family, his involvement in the Royal Geographical Society and the colonial and imperialist mix that was current in the late 19th and early 20th century in England ... it's all filler.Finally, finally, FINALLY the author takes the reader on his recent journey to the same area where Fawcett was last reported. The upshot is still that no one knows what happened, despite numerous attempts by numerous people to find out. The book ends with a short description of recent archaeological discoveries in the region that have uncovered much larger population centers and could have given rise to stories about an El Dorado or Z.That's it. The book could have been condensed into 50 pages and told exactly the same story."

Legend has it Fawcett was killed or captured by hostile tribes, starved to death, or perhaps as some fringe groups believe he transcended mortality when he found and entered the lost city of Z. Journalist David Grann finds new information regarding Fawcett's secret route and eventually follows Fawcett into an area of the world that still remains largely unknown - and hostile - to outsiders.

Along with that, the descriptions in the book are sometimes more than I would have liked, whether it be about bodies, diseases, deaths, etc. There were many bizarre religions mentioned, including the occult.The adventure Fawcett must have thrived on throughout his life was evident in this book, and it's what kept me reading when the story went on a tangent, which happened often. It would have been much easier to read if the author had chosen either his own experiences or Fawcett's to focus on throughout, as the jumps from one POV to the next were quite jarring most of the time.

235,0385513534,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1256603-sara,5,"You wouldn't think that a book featuring lost civilizations in the Amazon rain forest, cannibals, wild beasts, natives shooting poisoned arrows, mad men, and more man eating bugs then I ever want to encounter in a book ever again would best be described as subtle but such is the case with the totally wicked awesome Lost City of Z.David Grann, a reporter for the New Yorker, becomes intrigued by the story of Percy Fawcett an explorer in the early 1900's who became internationally famous for his forays into the Amazon rain forest with little more then a machete and an almost god like ability to survive even the most insane situations. In the course of his explorations Fawcett became obsessed with the idea of a lost civilization somewhere in the Amazon, a technologically and culturally advanced society hidden somewhere in the dense, impenetrable jungle. I'm not spoiling anything to let you know that Fawcett never found his city, which he mysteriously nicknamed ""Z,"" at 58 he took his 22 year old son and his son's best friend into the jungle determined to finally find it. The three men never returned and a legend was born.Over the years hundreds of would be rescuers and explorers have attempted to learn the fate of the last Fawcett expedition and/or discover Fawcett's fabled city.Grann joins their ranks and determines to journey there himself, leaving a wife and newborn son in New York City, to try to find the truth.There are two perfectly blended journey's here. Grann takes a ""no apologies"" approach in his exploration of Fawcett's life. We meet the tireless, obsessed explorer, negligent father and husband and the aggressive, easily offended bully who called anyone who couldn't match his 10 mile treks through unexplored jungle a ""coward."" Fawcett was certainly a thoroughly unlikable person but, as Grann takes pains to point out, its impossible to ignore his strength, dedication and intelligence. He changed the more time he spent in the Amazon among the tribes that lived there. He came to question the Victorian ""make the world England"" approach that was playing the same role the Spanish had years earlier in killing, subjugating and erasing the people who had thrived there for a thousand years. He fought bitterly against his own nature and that of his country to argue that ""savage"" was an abhorrent term perhaps best used to describe those attempting to ""civilize"" a people far beyond them already.Then we have Grann who through his own journey to the Amazon comes to understand that for all Fawcett's successes he lost site of those closest to him, those who needed him and depended upon him. He realizes that he too has become so blind to everything but this quest that he's abandoned his own family without a second thought.So yes, this is a book about crazy amazing adventures and secrets in the jungle and its amazingly exciting and so much fun to listen to at night right before bed. It really is like Indiana Jones comes to life (hell there's apparently an Indiana Jones novel ABOUT Fawcett and his city) but its also about what we lose when we put dreams ahead of everything else. Subtle and heart stopping. A nice combo it turns out."
236,0385513534,http://goodreads.com/user/show/83144-el,4,"I love a good yarn. I love those crazy stories about hidden treasures, travels to the ends of the earth, and driving obsessions - the more real they are, the better.In the Twenties, explorer Percy Fawcett wandered into the jungles of the Amazon to find the Lost City of Z, aka the ancient civilization, El Dorado. He was obsessed with the concept of this hidden civilization, and spent years researching and studying before embarking on his journey. But what happened? We know that most of his team died along the way, and that he sent his then 21-year-old son back home. But then the story ends basically, because Fawcett never made it out of the jungle. Was he driven to death by his own obsession? Was he eaten by a ginormous snake? Did he find the Lost City of Z and decide to just hang there for the rest of his days? David Grann picks up the story by not necessarily answering those questions, but by trying to follow in Fawcett's footsteps. Well... without that pesky ""getting-lost-in-the-Amazon-and-probably-dying"" thing.This is an engrossing story and totally fulfilled the wannabe archeologist I have inside, all the while reminding me that I would never last in the Amazon. It's hot, it's humid, there are bugs I've never even imagined (and I'm not being especially girly - I'm talking about mosquitoes that suck the juice off your eyeballs or those annoying things that basically get inside your junk and can not be removed), vampire bats, and did I mention the humidity? Yeah, it's not really a place that I could call home, but Fawcett apparently could, and Grann sure as heck could at least hang with the best of them. More power to those guys.Still, the bouncing back and forth between Grann's own expedition and that of Fawcett's was distracting at times. It would have been better if Grann just took one storyline and ran with it as they are singularly pretty fascinating. But Grann did a decent job of finding primary sources to back his (and Fawcett's) claims. My list of books to hunt down now has increased exponentially, and I suppose I can thank Grann for that, though I think it has more to do with the absolute craziness that possessed Fawcett that makes me want to know more about him."
237,0385513534,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4026072-kim,4,"I love travel and adventure and ancient civiliations so a real-life journey is a must-read for me. It is amazing how many people had invested time, money and, in some cases, their lives to search for a group that people said shouldn't have gone in the first place. Maybe if those people had helped fund the expedition they wouldn't have gone missing. Or as some conspiracies say maybe he wanted to go missing.But there's a part of me that would have also wanted to rush out looking for him. And that's the part that believes in the lost city of Z. Not the city of gold or the gilded man but the ancient civilization of the Amazon. The people and cities the original European explorers reported that were never seen again. And which science and archaeologists are finally confirming as being real. I would love to join the digs in South America, maybe one day I will.So why only 4 stars? The book is too short. I know it was originally written as an article and then extended but it was over too quick. I was really getting into the story and the discoveries when it finished. Now I'll have to find more books on the subject."

Grann's descriptions of all the horrible ways the Amazon can invade the body make me never want to stand in a forest again. However, the book did end on a good note: in awe of the great unknown civilizations that not only survive but thrived in the Amazon. I also found Grann's portrayal of the individuals that journeyed into the Amazon (and the people they left behind) interesting enough in themselves. What kind of people are compelled again and again to enter into a lonely hell? "

240,0385513534,http://goodreads.com/user/show/869064-jeremy,3,"This is kind of an odd accomplishment: an adventure book that will make you really really glad your not an adventurer. Grann's descriptions of Fawcett et al trampling through the amazonian rainforest with their crass, (often racist) imperialist delusions of grandeur and discovery are often gut-wrenching. Skin peels off in sheets, everyone gets malaria, parasites, maggot infections (shudder), gangrene, etc. Trekking through unspoiled tropical jungles is utterly horrifying, you basically just turn yourself into an oozing, walking meal and wait for the rainforest to literally devour you. Grann remains fairly non-judgmental through out. After all, it's the green hell of the jungle itself which finally breaks down and destroys hubris and good intentions alike. Seriously, some of this stuff would make Werner Herzog blush."

For most of the book I thought Percy Fawcett (the explorer whom the book is about) was probably a complete wack-a-doodle. At the end of the book, maybe only partially a wack-a-doodle but you do have to be somewhat obsessed to keep going back into that environment looking for a fabled ""Lost City"". I cannot fathom trekking into the Amazon jungle in our times with modern technology let alone in the 1920's when Fawcett did it. It is not a place I would ever desire to experience, just on the bug issue alone! Gross stuff in there!! The book is a bit long in places but overall pretty good.(Why is GR marking everything as read twice when it's only been read once?). Maddening!"

The author also has a new non-fiction book to be published in April, 2017: Killers of the Flower Moon. My original review:: ""This is a very readable, well researched book. It focuses on explorer Colonel Percy Fawcett, and his obsession to find a great. ancient city deep in the Amazon jungle which he called Z. Z ,if it existed, may have given rise to the legend of El Dorado. The book tells the story of Fawcett's quests, and of the author attempting to journey to the Amazon to try to solve some of the mystery around Fawcett's mysterious disappearance on his 1925 expedition.  Anyone interested in early 20th century exploration and past and present day Amazonia should enjoy this book. Prior to his ill-fated journey, Fawcett had explored the Amazon several times before. He was an arrogant man, rarely getting along with those who accompanied him on his journeys. He seemed immune to most tropical illnesses and scorned those who became ill or couldn't keep up to his break-neck pace, regarding them as weak. His obsession to find Z bordered on madness as he consulted spiritualists. The author found that his papers showed ever increasing bizarre beliefs. For his last journey he advertised for strong men to accompany him (no women allowed). A large number of scientists, explorers, athletes and people wanting adventure or just wishing to get just away from home replied. Among those turned down was Lawrence of Arabia . Fawcett felt that a person used to the desert would never keep up to him in the jungle. Instead he decided to go accompanied by his 21 year old son and the son's best friend.  As Fawcett was very secretive, not wanting any rival explorer to find Z before he did, his exact route was unknown or sometimes written in code. The disappearance of Fawcett and the two young men caused a sensation, and countless people also vanished or died searching for them.It also tells the stories of other explorers in the early part half of the 1800's. These adventurers have now been replaced by archaeologists and anthropologists. Grann discovers in his journey a ruins which may have led to the legend of Z which is now being studied and excavated, and he believes he knows the fate of Fawcett and the two young men from stories passed on by several Indian tribes."""
244,0385513534,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6969151-veeral,4,"That obnoxious Amazon. It likes to monopolize and dominate the jungle. Although one might be led to believe that there would be an abundance of everything where such a mighty force exists, the truth is exactly the opposite. As David Grann puts it himself: It’s the great “counterfeit paradise”. I couldn’t agree more. Amazon will starve you. Amazon will desiccate you. And finally, Amazon will obliterate you. Because, simply put, Amazon doesn’t care for you. It’s a green desert. Unfit for human civilization.Take the example of Colonel Percy Harrison Fawcett. He wanted to make “the great discovery of the century” by finding the cryptic lost City of Z but instead, the uncaring Amazon rainforest consumed him, his son (Jack) and his son’s friend (Raleigh Rimell). So, “the great discovery of the century” became infamous as what has often been described as “the greatest exploration mystery of the twentieth century”— that is, the mystery of the fate of Percy Fawcett and the whereabouts of the lost City of Z.Many have tried to solve the mystery over the years, but failed.No one could find exactly what happened to Fawcett and certainly no one could find any clues that Z ever existed. But why should it exist? It was really pointless of us to assume right from the start that a civilization could prosper under something as brutal and vainglorious as Amazon. Sure, Grann did made some flimsy attempts by the end of the book by hinting that a civilized colony might have existed in the Amazon in the past, but that didn’t half-convince me.So, one thing I would definitely take away from this book is the fact that, Amazon is the bane of civilization."
245,0385513534,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5858699-kavita,4,"David Grann is a journalist, who got fascinated with the legend of Percy Fawcett, the Amazon explorer who disappeared into the Amazon in 1925, along with his son and his son's friend. Fawcett's obsession with an ancient and highly complex civilisation within the Amazon rainforest forms the basis of this book. Grann sets out to prove that Fawcett was right, and makes a journey into the Amazon himself.The Lost City of Z is basically a biography of Fawcett and concentrates on his quest for the legendary city that he called Z. I originally assumed that it was Grann's own journey into the Amazon which would be described here. There were short chapters in which he got ready to enter the forest, and since the story was not about it, it all turned out to be superficial. It would have been much better if Grann had concentrated solely on the Fawcett story.Interestingly, Grann quotes from the writings of Spanish conquistadors who had travelled the Amazon in the 1500s. Their descriptions varied from those of Fawcett, because by then, the local tribes had been wiped out massively and the region deforested. Grann's own journey showed yet more deforestation and extinction of life since the 1900s. Sadly, a few hundred years down the line, we might not have an Amazon rainforest left despite its vastness, so these accounts are valuable. The real appeal of the book, of course, lies in the fact that you can enjoy the deadly rainforest from the comfort of your couch. Not for us the risking of our lives and confronting snakes, mosquitoes, and other creatures of the rainforest, not to mention battling disease, hunger, and thirst. For us, the delight of expertly sliding into a beautiful world you can romanticise without really having to move a muscle. The Inferno Verde can become a Paraíso Verde."
246,0385513534,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39134508-kathleen,4,"This book was chosen by my book club as the non-fiction book for the month. I am hoping that it will qualify for a Bingo square - name of a city in the title ""Lost City of Z"". David Grann is a reporter and states at the beginning of the book that he isn't the type to get involved in the stories he works on and researches. Once he finishes a story he moves on to the next one. But like other adventurers, David did get caught up in the ""greatest exploration mystery of the twentieth century"" and set out to solve the story about the disappearance of British explorer Perry Faucett, and his son in the Amazon. What happened to them while they were searching for the Lost City of Z? This is a very informative and interesting non-fiction book that reads much like an Indiana Jones adventure story. David Grann expertly weaves geography, history and science together resulting in a breath-taking narrative. I listened to the audiobook of this story narrated by the talented Mark Deakins. He is one of my favourite narrators because he uses different voices for each character, and the voices seem to fit the character -bringing the story ""alive"". (I have read over 160 audio books and feel this audiobook enhanced my experience reading this book. If you are new to audio books, I think you should opt for reading this in print.)I highly recommend this non-fiction book for readers interested in history, explorations, and the Amazon."

This is a new classic of the narrative nonfiction genre.The prose is vivid and intoxicating, and he weaves together 2+ threads, seamlessly--with the Fawcett thread dominant, as it should be, yet given fresh life with the mingling of the contemporary thread.I was drawn in from the start, but oddly enough, I REALLY got fascinated when he got to the developing field of cultural anthropology, and the fights over whether the people in the Amazon were ""noble savages"" or just ""savages,"" or stupid subhumans, or . . . and what the apparent tiny population really meant. Throughout the book, there was an adventure story going on, but a much wider, deeper consideration of how the discoveries there fundamentally altered our conceptions of how and why we all are the way we are. And it crept into those ideas artfully, interestingly and never pedantically. It never bogged down into a university course: felt more like an exciting speaker spurring our curiosity and helping us run with it.So well done. I'll use this as one of my models for all my future books.(And as a writer, I can't resist saying: Great verbs! I mean, stupendously great, every page, every paragraph.

In fact, I remember clearly that I didn't want to see it. The name sounded silly, and I had no clue what it was about. Visions of pirates and space creatures clouded my judgment. Luckily, my friends dragged me in by majority vote and I emerged from the theater two hours later, exhilarated, endlessly curious about early human cultures, and determined to live a more exciting life. And it stuck. Years later, I stood in the middle of Albuquerque receiving my degree in Anthropology, still consumed with a passion for learning about ancient human history and lost worlds. Percy Fawcett, the adventurer, explorer, and land surveyor at the heart of ""The Lost City of Z"" would have most likely seen a lot of himself in Indiana Jones. If ever there were a real-life version of the intrepid anthropologist, Fawcett would definitely be a frontrunner. And fate seemed to lead him there. In his early military years in Ceylon, Fawcett heard the legend of a lost city buried beneath an earthen mound near his base. He took it upon himself to try to locate this lost world, and appears to have had some success, although he did not have the wherewithal at the time to excavate it. Still, the thrill of the find and the desire to pursue other ""lost worlds"" grabbed hold of him then, and planted the seed of obsession that would follow him throughout the rest of his life. Working for the Royal Geographical Society, Fawcett was sent to the largely uncharted and dangerous forests of the Amazon. By many accounts, there seems to be no crueler environment in the world. When I was once contemplating graduate field work, I recalled the stories of an anthropologist who had visited our class to tell us about his work with the Yanamami, a tribe so fascinating and remote that many classmates later expressed their desire to do the same. But me? Not in the least. I knew the last place on earth I ever wanted to live - even for a short time - was within the bug-infested, snake-laden, vampire-bat heavy jaguar lair that is the Amazon. Mosquitoes love me here in New England. Imagine the feast I would provide them in the rain forest. I would be nearly bloodless in a week. But Fawcett, he was made for the place. Surveying the formerly unexplored (by white men) border between Brazil and Bolivia, he accomplished his mission nearly a year ahead of schedule. This despite losing half his team to disease, the arrows of hostile tribes, parasitic worms, viral infections, and starvation. By all accounts, Fawcett was impervious to disease, boasting a hardy constitution unphased by the rigors of a jungle so dense that a day's worth of hacking through it with machetes sometimes only gained the team a half a mile of advancement. His amazing physical stamina and seeming disdain for the suffering of others bred one of two things in the men who served him: intense loyalty or mutinous desire. The tales of both of these conditions in his many journeys back into the jungle after his acclaimed first mission, are the stuff of legend. But, somewhere along the way, Fawcett began to hear about a Lost City, much like the famed El Dorado, a city of vast palaces and towering pillars, filled with riches and covered in gold dust. Having encountered a smaller version of this phenomenon in Ceylon, Fawcett became intrigued. As time went on, intrigue turned to obsession, as more and more of the oral histories he encountered in the tribes he befriended, as well as the geographical and archaeological record that had newly been discovered began to substantiate the claims. When Hiram Bingham discovered Machu Picchu during the same time period as Fawcett's work, it only fueled his desire to find his own ""lost world."" ""The Lost City of Z"" is brilliantly told and exhaustively researched by David Grann. Needless to say, Fawcett's final mission involved a last ditch effort to find the city, taking only his grown son, his son's best friend and a couple of temporary native guides. They went into the forest in 1925 and were never heard from again. Since that time, literally hundreds of amateur explorers have trekked into the same hostile jungles to try to find the missing Colonel and his companions. As recently as 1995, a Bolivian businessman and his grown son (along with an expert team and the best technological aids) tried to finally find out what happened to the Fawcett team all those years ago, only to find themselves taken captive by an Amazonian tribe. (The tribe debated whether or not to kill them for three days until finally releasing them in exchange for their thirty thousand dollars worth of equipment.) And this was 1995 - not 1925. It is no wonder that Grann himself finally feels compelled to witness the land where Percy Fawcett was lost forever. His journey, which he documents late in the book, is far more eventful than I would have imagined, and his final meeting with the anthropologist Michael Hecklenberger, who has lived in the Amazon for over a dozen years now, was insightful and educational. For anyone who has ever felt the pull of exploration, imagined the thrill of a lost world, or even just really enjoyed the exploits of Indiana Jones, pick up this fascinating book. I doubt it will make you want to trek through the Amazon, (in fact, it may dissuade you from going to a jungle anywhere, ever, under any circumstances), but it might just make you want to explore a new culture, visit a museum, or even just take the long way home. And if it does, Percy Fawcett may have succeeded in some small way."
251,0385513534,http://goodreads.com/user/show/798978-barbara,5,"The story of ""Colonel"" Fawcett, and his explorations of the Amazon were once world known. Fawcett was searching for a legendary city in the jungle. He began his explorations in the 19th century. In the Victorian Age exploration was done by amateurs, and the field of anthropology was in its infancy. Fawcett's trips were financed by the Royal Geographic Society in London. Fawcett was relentless, driving his family into bankruptcy. On his final trip in 1925, he and his son, and a third man, disappeared.The descriptions of the explorations were hair raising. The insects were not only pests but dangerous. I won't go into detail but their effect on humans are disgusting. There was also danger from some the the warlike tribes, who as recently as the 1990's killed outsiders who wandered into their territory.The author Grann decides to investigate Fawcett and the ""lost city"". This book is mostly a report of Fawcett's life, and expeditions. He was famous not only for his numerous journeys, but his ability to form friendships with Amazon Indians, and his appreciation of their way of life. Grann himself travels to Brazil over a 100 years after Fawcett disappeared. This is a fascinating account, and one I found hard to put down."
252,0385513534,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1605591-christine,5,"	Shortly after I finished this book, the BBC World Service reported that a Brazilian man who advocated for small farmers, natives, and the rain forest was murdered. He was shot five times in the head while biking with his wife. The same report made reference to the 2005 killing of an American nun, a murder that Grann mentions in his book. What the news report drove home was the idea that the Amazon is still a dangerous place, just not exactly in the same way it was during Fawcett’s time. Instead of worrying about how a misunderstanding with a native tribe could end in the death of tribal members or of the group of explorers, the battle is now between business and various types of conversation. In many ways, a more violent battle, not just because everyone has guns.	This idea is not wholly examined in The Lost City of Z, though David Grann does touch on it in the closing chapters of his book, and the idea of the destruction of the natural world does run though a good portion of the book.	Much of the book is about Fawcett and his various trips to the Amazon; culminating in what was undoubtedly a fatal trip to find a “lost” city that he had named Z.	In fact, if you are going to learn anything from this book (and you are), the most important is the simple fact that if the natives tell you not to do something or go somewhere, LISTEN TO THEM! THEY KNOW FROM WHENCE THEY SPEAK!	(I’m using the slightly political incorrect term of natives because I am a good American who has been taught that Indian refers to a person from India. South American Native Americans is way too wordy, there too many tribes to list all the tribe names, and the term Native American or First People [nations:] would make me sound like the news anchor on CNN who referred to the African immigrants protesting/rioting in Paris a few years back as African-Americans.)	Fawcett was a man who spent more time in the Amazon then with his family. As an aside, Grann does a wonderful job of showing the strength of character of both Nina Fawcett and Grann’s own wife, making both women sound just as, if not more, heroic than their husbands. In fact, Mr. Grann, your wife sounds far more intelligent than you. (Sorry, don’t mean to offend, but she knew you needed more than sneakers before heading into the Amazon). The men who explored the Amazon seemed to have married very understand and supportive women (and, if possible, very rich women). While her husband was dealing with nasty bugs and a fish that could swim up his wee-wee, Nina Fawcett was giving birth to their second child, raising their first (eventually raising all three children), keeping house, and protecting her husband’s reputation, all of this on a rather limited budget.	To be far, Fawcett seemed to know that he was unworthy of her. This is what makes the book charming. It’s warts and all, and the people who have warts, know they have them. It’s very human.	Fawcett became convinced that there was lost civilization in the Amazon, basically a version of the city of gold myth. It was during an attempt to find this city that Fawcett, his eldest son Jack, and his son’s closest friend disappeared in the Amazon. The disappearance set off searches, rescue missions, and theories (such as this book), possibly resulting in another 100 deaths/disappearances.	Grann seems aware of his obsession and the risks it brings to both himself and his family. In fact, it seems like this is going to be his only big adventure. It seems he learned a lesson that Fawcett didn’t or couldn’t learn.	In some ways, the most interesting part of the book is the closing chapter which describes what a lost civilization in the Amazon is truly. Think the Incas, the Mayans, the Aztecs but in a different country. If the rain forest is turned wholly over to big business, if its defenders and supporters are murdered then not only do the flora and fauna of the Amazon disappear, not only do tribal cultures (if not whole tribes) die, but the Lost City of Z will still forever be lost."

While not really giving any sort of definitive answer to what happened to Percy Fawcett on his last expedition, the book was a wonderfully researched book on turn of the century amateur exploration and the competition that ensued between these gentleman rivals.While the final discovery was a great vindication of those explorers who felt that there had to be some sort of great civilization in the Amazon region, we are still not sure that Z has been or ever will be found.Nonetheless, this is one journey that I was happy to make with the author and am amazed at the treasure trove of new information he was able to provide everyone."

The story of real-life adventurer Fawcett was interesting in itself, of course, but maybe not quite five stars. HOWEVER, I was pleasantly surprised that the book also gave me a sense of early 20th popular culture. I walked away with a new perspective on the environment that produced stories like The Lost World and At the Mountains of Madness. Also, I have scratched the deep amazon off my list of places to go hiking."

256,0385513534,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35799-amy,4,"Colonel Percy Harrison Fawcett was quite a famous explorer in his day. The last of the ""great Victorian explorers"", he inspired the creation of Indiana Jones (and quite possibly Commander McBragg). He was as well known at the time as Dr. Livingstone, and had a reputation of being indestructible. He became obsessed with El Dorado, the mythical (?) city of gold, which he also referred to as Z. In 1925, he took his oldest son and one of his son's friends on an expedition into the jungles of Brazil to find it. They were never seen again outside of the Amazon. Over the course of the next decades, dozens of expeditions set out to find the Fawcett party, or traces of it, including other famous explorers of the time, an actor who had played an explorer (!), and Fawcett's younger son Brian. Some of them were also lost. In addition, many people died just looking for El Dorado. More modern science concluded that no complex civilization could have endured in the Amazon, in so hostile an environment.This book tells the story of Fawcett and traces this final expedition. The author even traveled to Brazil himself to try to follow Fawcett's last trail and try to find out what exactly happened to him. (When he reached one point where Fawcett had been in the jungle, he said that it looked ""like Nebraska"" now - deforestation is real.) Using Fawcett's private notes from previous trips that the family shared with him, as well as dispatches from his final one, Grann was able to find the spot where he thought they had started from (Fawcett had said one thing in his public notes for the Royal Geographic Society, to keep the exact location confidential because other explorers were out there looking. But Grann found another set of coordinates in Fawcett's private notes).I don't know anything about this man or his expeditions, but it seems to me that Grann has helped answer some of the questions that surrounded him. And maybe the Amazon isn't as hostile to agriculture and society as previously thought?On the other hand.... it is pretty much just waiting to kill you so I don't recommend trying it."
257,0385513534,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1758594-patrick-gibson,4,"This author was on the Colbert show a few nights ago. Even though Steven wouldn’t give the poor guy a chance to talk, the story seemed right up my alley so I picked up the book the next day. Isn’t that why authors appear on talk shows, so that numb-nuts like me will rush to Borders?Percy Harrison Fawcett was the real-life explorer whose adventures Arthur Conan Doyle drew upon for his 1912 novel ‘The Lost Word.’ While Fawcett did not find a South American plateau populated with dinosaurs, he did lead numerous expeditions looking for lost civilizations. On his last and most ambitious—seeking the City of Z—he vanished. Over the past seventy-five years there have been hundreds of other expeditions into the Amazon, by a myriad of adventurers, looking for Percy Fawcett. All failed. Hundreds died. Many were never heard from again.Fawcett marked the end of an age. He was the last of the individualist explores. The day of the airplane, the radio, the organized and heavily financed modern expedition had not arrived. With him, it was the heroic story of a man against a vast uncharted wilderness nearly the size of the continental United States inhabited by deadly warriors.Armed with newly discovered information found in a trunk by one of Fawcett’s grandchildren the author, after completing exhaustive research, decides to enter the Amazon and follow the path of Fawcett’s last journey. This is a little eye-brow lifting because the author is a middle aged slightly chunky New Yorker who is the complete opposite of the rigorously trained, physically fit, handsome Fawcett. Thus the consequence of obsession, I guess.Throughout the nineteenth century there was a tremendous speculation concerning the ‘lesser’ civilizations and their inability to reach a level of sophistication beyond living in huts and foraging for food. Darwin did nothing to dispel this attitude—in fact, augmented it. Fawcett was unique in his vision and belief that remote jungle societies could indeed build out of stone, decipher the movements of the stars and create a written language. Without any concrete knowledge of its existence, he was determined to find proof, in the form of a magnificent stone city—he called Z—in the blank parts of the Amazon maps.For Fawcett’s final, and according to him ‘definitive’ 1925 excursion, instead of a group of hunter/explorers, he took only his twenty-one year old son Jack, and Jack’s companion Raleigh Rimell (who really wanted to go to Hollywood and become a silent movie star). For a while the trio sent native runners out of the jungle with progress reports. Their messages would be telegraphed to cities in the United States and eventually newspapers around the world published accounts of their progress. The world literally followed their escapades like a serial novel. Then everything stopped. And the world went nuts. Every major geographical society mounted rescue parties. Finding Fawcett Fever lasted for years. Even in the 1950’s there were rumors Fawcett was still alive and lording like a king over a remote tribe. In the 1960’s, rescue parties were mounted and sent into the wilds. More people died searching for Fawcett than looking for the headwaters of the Nile or panning gold in the Pacific northwest. It’s a pretty amazing story and a whopping good read. The author knows how to pace his story and exactly the right time to intersperse details of his own trek though the tropical forest.I have always wondered about these curious lines from ‘Othello”:And of the Cannibals that each other eat,The Anthropophagi, and men whose headsDo grow beneath their shoulders.It comes from an idea Shakespeare borrowed from Sir Walter Raleigh writing about Francisco de Orellana, whose expedition into the Amazon vanished in 1542. One of the many Christian xenophobes who contributed to slavery in the Western hemisphere. (Raleigh, not Shakespeare.)The author doesn’t have an ending and the story looses its momentum towards the end, but it is an intriguing story, well researched and a very interesting read. Completely enjoyable."

That is, talking about sales forecasts, writing up spread sheets and cursing Excel when I couldn't copy/paste from one cell to another, and being encouraged to think of ways I could improve the company while knowing I could be laid off at any minute. All so common, and all such a snore. Now, even my exciting life in Italy is still tedious at times, albeit for different reasons.Then a book like this comes along to rip us out of the goddamn delirium of every day life. This is the true story of when men were men and the world was a place to be explored and conquered so that the blank places on maps could be filled in and the Queen could get a few more jewels in her crown. The ballsiest of all explorers, Percy Fawcett, thought that hiking through the Amazon in a search for the legendary city of El Dorado was a good way to spend his time. KICK ASS. And there's even more fun here: swarming mosquitoes that carry disease, small catfish that like to lodge themselves IN the anus or urethra and can only be removed by surgery, blood-sucking bats, disease, parasites, and Indians in the bush just waiting to shoot you with poison arrows and shrink your head, sell it to collectors, and have it turn up in a pawn shop in Vegas. WICKED! Fawcett's eventual disappearance and the likelihood that an ancient, advanced civilization thrived in the Amazon and was wiped out by conquistadors are sobering reminders that this incredible story is as true as it gets. This book is a mystery, an adventure tale, and travelogue all rolled into one fly-through read. And it's the kind of thing that makes spreadsheets, the 9 to 5 drill, and even Excel, bearable.

It was a worldwide publicized event, with Fawcett writing journal entries and having a messenger take them to the nearest large town to be sent via telegraph to the rest of the world. Then the entries suddenly stopped and Fawcett was never heard from again. Expeditions were made to discover what happened to them; nothing was ever found, while some more people were lost to the Amazon. The Lost City of Z is the story of Percy Fawcett, his life and how he became a great explorer, and where his obsession for the Amazon came from. It is also the story of the mystery of this doomed last expedition, and all the efforts – some ending in tragedy – that have been made since then.David Grann is a staff writer for the New Yorker who first found out about Percy Fawcett while researching an article on the mysterious death of the world’s foremost Sherlock Holmes expert. The Lost City of Z takes Grann all over the world, from visiting Fawcett’s great granddaughter and seeing some of his original journal entries, to putting together his own expedition to find out what really happened to Percy Fawcett. The Lost City of Z is the incredible story of one of the last explorers, but it is also the story of the strength of the human spirit and it’s drive to never give up.

I liked the format with the biographical and historical information interspersed with the authors research in libraries and archives, and shopping trips to adventure outfitters. How had I never heard of the Fawcett mystery until now? It seems like a story ripe for Hollywood or various adventure stories, so it is a wonder that it took this long to have some quality research on the topic (or have I just been ignorant of this?) Interesting aside - as I was reading this, my husband is reading Candice Millard's *River of Doubt* about Roosevelt's travels in Amazon. It was intriguing to hear the Grann citing that book, and for my husband and I to discuss the two expeditions and how they differed. I look forward to reading that book soon to continue my own little obsession with rainforest adventure stories...This book describes a very different Amazon than the one I encountered on my trip to Peru in 2007 - of course, I was not in the deepest darkest part of the forest, but we were ""roughing it"" by a lot of standards... I guess that is because over the last century there have been significant strides in public health and sanitation, disease prevention, and research on tropical climes... even in the author's travels in 2006 and 2007, he describes a very different Brazilian rainforest than Fawcett encountered 80 years prior. This alone causes some concern that things can change so significantly in the relatively short span of years..."

Fawcett's British colonial background, his early years, other explorations, his family, his involvement in the Royal Geographical Society and the colonial and imperialist mix that was current in the late 19th and early 20th century in England ... it's all filler.Finally, finally, FINALLY the author takes the reader on his recent journey to the same area where Fawcett was last reported. The upshot is still that no one knows what happened, despite numerous attempts by numerous people to find out. The book ends with a short description of recent archaeological discoveries in the region that have uncovered much larger population centers and could have given rise to stories about an El Dorado or Z.That's it. The book could have been condensed into 50 pages and told exactly the same story."

Legend has it Fawcett was killed or captured by hostile tribes, starved to death, or perhaps as some fringe groups believe he transcended mortality when he found and entered the lost city of Z.

Along with that, the descriptions in the book are sometimes more than I would have liked, whether it be about bodies, diseases, deaths, etc. There were many bizarre religions mentioned, including the occult.The adventure Fawcett must have thrived on throughout his life was evident in this book, and it's what kept me reading when the story went on a tangent, which happened often.

In the course of his explorations Fawcett became obsessed with the idea of a lost civilization somewhere in the Amazon, a technologically and culturally advanced society hidden somewhere in the dense, impenetrable jungle. I'm not spoiling anything to let you know that Fawcett never found his city, which he mysteriously nicknamed ""Z,"" at 58 he took his 22 year old son and his son's best friend into the jungle determined to finally find it. The three men never returned and a legend was born.Over the years hundreds of would be rescuers and explorers have attempted to learn the fate of the last Fawcett expedition and/or discover Fawcett's fabled city.Grann joins their ranks and determines to journey there himself, leaving a wife and newborn son in New York City, to try to find the truth.There are two perfectly blended journey's here. Grann takes a ""no apologies"" approach in his exploration of Fawcett's life. We meet the tireless, obsessed explorer, negligent father and husband and the aggressive, easily offended bully who called anyone who couldn't match his 10 mile treks through unexplored jungle a ""coward."" Fawcett was certainly a thoroughly unlikable person but, as Grann takes pains to point out, its impossible to ignore his strength, dedication and intelligence. He changed the more time he spent in the Amazon among the tribes that lived there. He came to question the Victorian ""make the world England"" approach that was playing the same role the Spanish had years earlier in killing, subjugating and erasing the people who had thrived there for a thousand years. He fought bitterly against his own nature and that of his country to argue that ""savage"" was an abhorrent term perhaps best used to describe those attempting to ""civilize"" a people far beyond them already.Then we have Grann who through his own journey to the Amazon comes to understand that for all Fawcett's successes he lost site of those closest to him, those who needed him and depended upon him. He realizes that he too has become so blind to everything but this quest that he's abandoned his own family without a second thought.So yes, this is a book about crazy amazing adventures and secrets in the jungle and its amazingly exciting and so much fun to listen to at night right before bed. It really is like Indiana Jones comes to life (hell there's apparently an Indiana Jones novel ABOUT Fawcett and his city) but its also about what we lose when we put dreams ahead of everything else. Subtle and heart stopping. A nice combo it turns out."
266,0385513534,http://goodreads.com/user/show/83144-el,4,"I love a good yarn. I love those crazy stories about hidden treasures, travels to the ends of the earth, and driving obsessions - the more real they are, the better.In the Twenties, explorer Percy Fawcett wandered into the jungles of the Amazon to find the Lost City of Z, aka the ancient civilization, El Dorado. He was obsessed with the concept of this hidden civilization, and spent years researching and studying before embarking on his journey. But what happened? We know that most of his team died along the way, and that he sent his then 21-year-old son back home. But then the story ends basically, because Fawcett never made it out of the jungle. Was he driven to death by his own obsession? Was he eaten by a ginormous snake? Did he find the Lost City of Z and decide to just hang there for the rest of his days? David Grann picks up the story by not necessarily answering those questions, but by trying to follow in Fawcett's footsteps. Well... without that pesky ""getting-lost-in-the-Amazon-and-probably-dying"" thing.This is an engrossing story and totally fulfilled the wannabe archeologist I have inside, all the while reminding me that I would never last in the Amazon. It's hot, it's humid, there are bugs I've never even imagined (and I'm not being especially girly - I'm talking about mosquitoes that suck the juice off your eyeballs or those annoying things that basically get inside your junk and can not be removed), vampire bats, and did I mention the humidity? Yeah, it's not really a place that I could call home, but Fawcett apparently could, and Grann sure as heck could at least hang with the best of them. More power to those guys.Still, the bouncing back and forth between Grann's own expedition and that of Fawcett's was distracting at times. It would have been better if Grann just took one storyline and ran with it as they are singularly pretty fascinating. But Grann did a decent job of finding primary sources to back his (and Fawcett's) claims. My list of books to hunt down now has increased exponentially, and I suppose I can thank Grann for that, though I think it has more to do with the absolute craziness that possessed Fawcett that makes me want to know more about him."

It is amazing how many people had invested time, money and, in some cases, their lives to search for a group that people said shouldn't have gone in the first place. Maybe if those people had helped fund the expedition they wouldn't have gone missing. Or as some conspiracies say maybe he wanted to go missing.But there's a part of me that would have also wanted to rush out looking for him. And that's the part that believes in the lost city of Z. Not the city of gold or the gilded man but the ancient civilization of the Amazon. The people and cities the original European explorers reported that were never seen again. And which science and archaeologists are finally confirming as being real. I would love to join the digs in South America, maybe one day I will.So why only 4 stars? The book is too short. I know it was originally written as an article and then extended but it was over too quick. I was really getting into the story and the discoveries when it finished.

Grann's descriptions of Fawcett et al trampling through the amazonian rainforest with their crass, (often racist) imperialist delusions of grandeur and discovery are often gut-wrenching. Skin peels off in sheets, everyone gets malaria, parasites, maggot infections (shudder), gangrene, etc. Trekking through unspoiled tropical jungles is utterly horrifying, you basically just turn yourself into an oozing, walking meal and wait for the rainforest to literally devour you. Grann remains fairly non-judgmental through out. After all, it's the green hell of the jungle itself which finally breaks down and destroys hubris and good intentions alike. Seriously, some of this stuff would make Werner Herzog blush."

For most of the book I thought Percy Fawcett (the explorer whom the book is about) was probably a complete wack-a-doodle. At the end of the book, maybe only partially a wack-a-doodle but you do have to be somewhat obsessed to keep going back into that environment looking for a fabled ""Lost City"". I cannot fathom trekking into the Amazon jungle in our times with modern technology let alone in the 1920's when Fawcett did it. It is not a place I would ever desire to experience, just on the bug issue alone! Gross stuff in there!!

Z ,if it existed, may have given rise to the legend of El Dorado. The book tells the story of Fawcett's quests, and of the author attempting to journey to the Amazon to try to solve some of the mystery around Fawcett's mysterious disappearance on his 1925 expedition.  Anyone interested in early 20th century exploration and past and present day Amazonia should enjoy this book. Prior to his ill-fated journey, Fawcett had explored the Amazon several times before. He was an arrogant man, rarely getting along with those who accompanied him on his journeys. He seemed immune to most tropical illnesses and scorned those who became ill or couldn't keep up to his break-neck pace, regarding them as weak. His obsession to find Z bordered on madness as he consulted spiritualists. The author found that his papers showed ever increasing bizarre beliefs. For his last journey he advertised for strong men to accompany him (no women allowed). A large number of scientists, explorers, athletes and people wanting adventure or just wishing to get just away from home replied. Among those turned down was Lawrence of Arabia . Fawcett felt that a person used to the desert would never keep up to him in the jungle. Instead he decided to go accompanied by his 21 year old son and the son's best friend.  As Fawcett was very secretive, not wanting any rival explorer to find Z before he did, his exact route was unknown or sometimes written in code. The disappearance of Fawcett and the two young men caused a sensation, and countless people also vanished or died searching for them.It also tells the stories of other explorers in the early part half of the 1800's. These adventurers have now been replaced by archaeologists and anthropologists. Grann discovers in his journey a ruins which may have led to the legend of Z which is now being studied and excavated, and he believes he knows the fate of Fawcett and the two young men from stories passed on by several Indian tribes."""

Although one might be led to believe that there would be an abundance of everything where such a mighty force exists, the truth is exactly the opposite. As David Grann puts it himself: It’s the great “counterfeit paradise”. I couldn’t agree more. Amazon will starve you. Amazon will desiccate you. And finally, Amazon will obliterate you. Because, simply put, Amazon doesn’t care for you. It’s a green desert. Unfit for human civilization.Take the example of Colonel Percy Harrison Fawcett. He wanted to make “the great discovery of the century” by finding the cryptic lost City of Z but instead, the uncaring Amazon rainforest consumed him, his son (Jack) and his son’s friend (Raleigh Rimell). So, “the great discovery of the century” became infamous as what has often been described as “the greatest exploration mystery of the twentieth century”— that is, the mystery of the fate of Percy Fawcett and the whereabouts of the lost City of Z.Many have tried to solve the mystery over the years, but failed.No one could find exactly what happened to Fawcett and certainly no one could find any clues that Z ever existed. But why should it exist? It was really pointless of us to assume right from the start that a civilization could prosper under something as brutal and vainglorious as Amazon. Sure, Grann did made some flimsy attempts by the end of the book by hinting that a civilized colony might have existed in the Amazon in the past, but that didn’t half-convince me.So, one thing I would definitely take away from this book is the fact that, Amazon is the bane of civilization."
275,0385513534,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5858699-kavita,4,"David Grann is a journalist, who got fascinated with the legend of Percy Fawcett, the Amazon explorer who disappeared into the Amazon in 1925, along with his son and his son's friend. Fawcett's obsession with an ancient and highly complex civilisation within the Amazon rainforest forms the basis of this book. Grann sets out to prove that Fawcett was right, and makes a journey into the Amazon himself.The Lost City of Z is basically a biography of Fawcett and concentrates on his quest for the legendary city that he called Z. I originally assumed that it was Grann's own journey into the Amazon which would be described here. There were short chapters in which he got ready to enter the forest, and since the story was not about it, it all turned out to be superficial. It would have been much better if Grann had concentrated solely on the Fawcett story.Interestingly, Grann quotes from the writings of Spanish conquistadors who had travelled the Amazon in the 1500s. Their descriptions varied from those of Fawcett, because by then, the local tribes had been wiped out massively and the region deforested. Grann's own journey showed yet more deforestation and extinction of life since the 1900s. Sadly, a few hundred years down the line, we might not have an Amazon rainforest left despite its vastness, so these accounts are valuable. The real appeal of the book, of course, lies in the fact that you can enjoy the deadly rainforest from the comfort of your couch. Not for us the risking of our lives and confronting snakes, mosquitoes, and other creatures of the rainforest, not to mention battling disease, hunger, and thirst. For us, the delight of expertly sliding into a beautiful world you can romanticise without really having to move a muscle. The Inferno Verde can become a Paraíso Verde."
276,0385513534,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39134508-kathleen,4,"This book was chosen by my book club as the non-fiction book for the month. I am hoping that it will qualify for a Bingo square - name of a city in the title ""Lost City of Z"". David Grann is a reporter and states at the beginning of the book that he isn't the type to get involved in the stories he works on and researches. Once he finishes a story he moves on to the next one. But like other adventurers, David did get caught up in the ""greatest exploration mystery of the twentieth century"" and set out to solve the story about the disappearance of British explorer Perry Faucett, and his son in the Amazon. What happened to them while they were searching for the Lost City of Z? This is a very informative and interesting non-fiction book that reads much like an Indiana Jones adventure story. David Grann expertly weaves geography, history and science together resulting in a breath-taking narrative. I listened to the audiobook of this story narrated by the talented Mark Deakins. He is one of my favourite narrators because he uses different voices for each character, and the voices seem to fit the character -bringing the story ""alive"". (I have read over 160 audio books and feel this audiobook enhanced my experience reading this book. If you are new to audio books, I think you should opt for reading this in print.)I highly recommend this non-fiction book for readers interested in history, explorations, and the Amazon."

278,0385513534,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2370826-dave-cullen,5,"Brilliant. This is a new classic of the narrative nonfiction genre.The prose is vivid and intoxicating, and he weaves together 2+ threads, seamlessly--with the Fawcett thread dominant, as it should be, yet given fresh life with the mingling of the contemporary thread.I was drawn in from the start, but oddly enough, I REALLY got fascinated when he got to the developing field of cultural anthropology, and the fights over whether the people in the Amazon were ""noble savages"" or just ""savages,"" or stupid subhumans, or . . . and what the apparent tiny population really meant. Throughout the book, there was an adventure story going on, but a much wider, deeper consideration of how the discoveries there fundamentally altered our conceptions of how and why we all are the way we are. And it crept into those ideas artfully, interestingly and never pedantically. It never bogged down into a university course: felt more like an exciting speaker spurring our curiosity and helping us run with it.So well done. I'll use this as one of my models for all my future books.(And as a writer, I can't resist saying: Great verbs! I mean, stupendously great, every page, every paragraph. Never too much, consistently just right.)"

280,0385513534,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1377720-deborah-edwards,5,"Do you remember the first time you saw ""Raiders of the Lost Ark?"" Because I do. In fact, I remember clearly that I didn't want to see it. The name sounded silly, and I had no clue what it was about. Visions of pirates and space creatures clouded my judgment. Luckily, my friends dragged me in by majority vote and I emerged from the theater two hours later, exhilarated, endlessly curious about early human cultures, and determined to live a more exciting life. And it stuck. Years later, I stood in the middle of Albuquerque receiving my degree in Anthropology, still consumed with a passion for learning about ancient human history and lost worlds. Percy Fawcett, the adventurer, explorer, and land surveyor at the heart of ""The Lost City of Z"" would have most likely seen a lot of himself in Indiana Jones. If ever there were a real-life version of the intrepid anthropologist, Fawcett would definitely be a frontrunner. And fate seemed to lead him there. In his early military years in Ceylon, Fawcett heard the legend of a lost city buried beneath an earthen mound near his base. He took it upon himself to try to locate this lost world, and appears to have had some success, although he did not have the wherewithal at the time to excavate it. Still, the thrill of the find and the desire to pursue other ""lost worlds"" grabbed hold of him then, and planted the seed of obsession that would follow him throughout the rest of his life. Working for the Royal Geographical Society, Fawcett was sent to the largely uncharted and dangerous forests of the Amazon. By many accounts, there seems to be no crueler environment in the world. When I was once contemplating graduate field work, I recalled the stories of an anthropologist who had visited our class to tell us about his work with the Yanamami, a tribe so fascinating and remote that many classmates later expressed their desire to do the same. But me? Not in the least. I knew the last place on earth I ever wanted to live - even for a short time - was within the bug-infested, snake-laden, vampire-bat heavy jaguar lair that is the Amazon. Mosquitoes love me here in New England. Imagine the feast I would provide them in the rain forest. I would be nearly bloodless in a week. But Fawcett, he was made for the place. Surveying the formerly unexplored (by white men) border between Brazil and Bolivia, he accomplished his mission nearly a year ahead of schedule. This despite losing half his team to disease, the arrows of hostile tribes, parasitic worms, viral infections, and starvation. By all accounts, Fawcett was impervious to disease, boasting a hardy constitution unphased by the rigors of a jungle so dense that a day's worth of hacking through it with machetes sometimes only gained the team a half a mile of advancement. His amazing physical stamina and seeming disdain for the suffering of others bred one of two things in the men who served him: intense loyalty or mutinous desire. The tales of both of these conditions in his many journeys back into the jungle after his acclaimed first mission, are the stuff of legend. But, somewhere along the way, Fawcett began to hear about a Lost City, much like the famed El Dorado, a city of vast palaces and towering pillars, filled with riches and covered in gold dust. Having encountered a smaller version of this phenomenon in Ceylon, Fawcett became intrigued. As time went on, intrigue turned to obsession, as more and more of the oral histories he encountered in the tribes he befriended, as well as the geographical and archaeological record that had newly been discovered began to substantiate the claims. When Hiram Bingham discovered Machu Picchu during the same time period as Fawcett's work, it only fueled his desire to find his own ""lost world."" ""The Lost City of Z"" is brilliantly told and exhaustively researched by David Grann. Needless to say, Fawcett's final mission involved a last ditch effort to find the city, taking only his grown son, his son's best friend and a couple of temporary native guides. They went into the forest in 1925 and were never heard from again. Since that time, literally hundreds of amateur explorers have trekked into the same hostile jungles to try to find the missing Colonel and his companions. As recently as 1995, a Bolivian businessman and his grown son (along with an expert team and the best technological aids) tried to finally find out what happened to the Fawcett team all those years ago, only to find themselves taken captive by an Amazonian tribe. (The tribe debated whether or not to kill them for three days until finally releasing them in exchange for their thirty thousand dollars worth of equipment.) And this was 1995 - not 1925. It is no wonder that Grann himself finally feels compelled to witness the land where Percy Fawcett was lost forever. His journey, which he documents late in the book, is far more eventful than I would have imagined, and his final meeting with the anthropologist Michael Hecklenberger, who has lived in the Amazon for over a dozen years now, was insightful and educational. For anyone who has ever felt the pull of exploration, imagined the thrill of a lost world, or even just really enjoyed the exploits of Indiana Jones, pick up this fascinating book. I doubt it will make you want to trek through the Amazon, (in fact, it may dissuade you from going to a jungle anywhere, ever, under any circumstances), but it might just make you want to explore a new culture, visit a museum, or even just take the long way home. And if it does, Percy Fawcett may have succeeded in some small way."
281,0385513534,http://goodreads.com/user/show/798978-barbara,5,"The story of ""Colonel"" Fawcett, and his explorations of the Amazon were once world known. Fawcett was searching for a legendary city in the jungle. He began his explorations in the 19th century. In the Victorian Age exploration was done by amateurs, and the field of anthropology was in its infancy. Fawcett's trips were financed by the Royal Geographic Society in London. Fawcett was relentless, driving his family into bankruptcy. On his final trip in 1925, he and his son, and a third man, disappeared.The descriptions of the explorations were hair raising. The insects were not only pests but dangerous. I won't go into detail but their effect on humans are disgusting. There was also danger from some the the warlike tribes, who as recently as the 1990's killed outsiders who wandered into their territory.The author Grann decides to investigate Fawcett and the ""lost city"". This book is mostly a report of Fawcett's life, and expeditions. He was famous not only for his numerous journeys, but his ability to form friendships with Amazon Indians, and his appreciation of their way of life. Grann himself travels to Brazil over a 100 years after Fawcett disappeared. This is a fascinating account, and one I found hard to put down."
282,0385513534,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1605591-christine,5,"	Shortly after I finished this book, the BBC World Service reported that a Brazilian man who advocated for small farmers, natives, and the rain forest was murdered. He was shot five times in the head while biking with his wife. The same report made reference to the 2005 killing of an American nun, a murder that Grann mentions in his book. What the news report drove home was the idea that the Amazon is still a dangerous place, just not exactly in the same way it was during Fawcett’s time. Instead of worrying about how a misunderstanding with a native tribe could end in the death of tribal members or of the group of explorers, the battle is now between business and various types of conversation. In many ways, a more violent battle, not just because everyone has guns.	This idea is not wholly examined in The Lost City of Z, though David Grann does touch on it in the closing chapters of his book, and the idea of the destruction of the natural world does run though a good portion of the book.	Much of the book is about Fawcett and his various trips to the Amazon; culminating in what was undoubtedly a fatal trip to find a “lost” city that he had named Z.	In fact, if you are going to learn anything from this book (and you are), the most important is the simple fact that if the natives tell you not to do something or go somewhere, LISTEN TO THEM! THEY KNOW FROM WHENCE THEY SPEAK!	(I’m using the slightly political incorrect term of natives because I am a good American who has been taught that Indian refers to a person from India. South American Native Americans is way too wordy, there too many tribes to list all the tribe names, and the term Native American or First People [nations:] would make me sound like the news anchor on CNN who referred to the African immigrants protesting/rioting in Paris a few years back as African-Americans.)	Fawcett was a man who spent more time in the Amazon then with his family. As an aside, Grann does a wonderful job of showing the strength of character of both Nina Fawcett and Grann’s own wife, making both women sound just as, if not more, heroic than their husbands. In fact, Mr. Grann, your wife sounds far more intelligent than you. (Sorry, don’t mean to offend, but she knew you needed more than sneakers before heading into the Amazon). The men who explored the Amazon seemed to have married very understand and supportive women (and, if possible, very rich women). While her husband was dealing with nasty bugs and a fish that could swim up his wee-wee, Nina Fawcett was giving birth to their second child, raising their first (eventually raising all three children), keeping house, and protecting her husband’s reputation, all of this on a rather limited budget.	To be far, Fawcett seemed to know that he was unworthy of her. This is what makes the book charming. It’s warts and all, and the people who have warts, know they have them. It’s very human.	Fawcett became convinced that there was lost civilization in the Amazon, basically a version of the city of gold myth. It was during an attempt to find this city that Fawcett, his eldest son Jack, and his son’s closest friend disappeared in the Amazon. The disappearance set off searches, rescue missions, and theories (such as this book), possibly resulting in another 100 deaths/disappearances.	Grann seems aware of his obsession and the risks it brings to both himself and his family. In fact, it seems like this is going to be his only big adventure. It seems he learned a lesson that Fawcett didn’t or couldn’t learn.	In some ways, the most interesting part of the book is the closing chapter which describes what a lost civilization in the Amazon is truly. Think the Incas, the Mayans, the Aztecs but in a different country. If the rain forest is turned wholly over to big business, if its defenders and supporters are murdered then not only do the flora and fauna of the Amazon disappear, not only do tribal cultures (if not whole tribes) die, but the Lost City of Z will still forever be lost."

While not really giving any sort of definitive answer to what happened to Percy Fawcett on his last expedition, the book was a wonderfully researched book on turn of the century amateur exploration and the competition that ensued between these gentleman rivals.While the final discovery was a great vindication of those explorers who felt that there had to be some sort of great civilization in the Amazon region, we are still not sure that Z has been or ever will be found.Nonetheless, this is one journey that I was happy to make with the author and am amazed at the treasure trove of new information he was able to provide everyone."

HOWEVER, I was pleasantly surprised that the book also gave me a sense of early 20th popular culture.

286,0385513534,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35799-amy,4,"Colonel Percy Harrison Fawcett was quite a famous explorer in his day. The last of the ""great Victorian explorers"", he inspired the creation of Indiana Jones (and quite possibly Commander McBragg). He was as well known at the time as Dr. Livingstone, and had a reputation of being indestructible. He became obsessed with El Dorado, the mythical (?) city of gold, which he also referred to as Z. In 1925, he took his oldest son and one of his son's friends on an expedition into the jungles of Brazil to find it. They were never seen again outside of the Amazon. Over the course of the next decades, dozens of expeditions set out to find the Fawcett party, or traces of it, including other famous explorers of the time, an actor who had played an explorer (!), and Fawcett's younger son Brian. Some of them were also lost. In addition, many people died just looking for El Dorado. More modern science concluded that no complex civilization could have endured in the Amazon, in so hostile an environment.This book tells the story of Fawcett and traces this final expedition. The author even traveled to Brazil himself to try to follow Fawcett's last trail and try to find out what exactly happened to him. (When he reached one point where Fawcett had been in the jungle, he said that it looked ""like Nebraska"" now - deforestation is real.) Using Fawcett's private notes from previous trips that the family shared with him, as well as dispatches from his final one, Grann was able to find the spot where he thought they had started from (Fawcett had said one thing in his public notes for the Royal Geographic Society, to keep the exact location confidential because other explorers were out there looking. But Grann found another set of coordinates in Fawcett's private notes).I don't know anything about this man or his expeditions, but it seems to me that Grann has helped answer some of the questions that surrounded him. And maybe the Amazon isn't as hostile to agriculture and society as previously thought?On the other hand.... it is pretty much just waiting to kill you so I don't recommend trying it."

Even though Steven wouldn’t give the poor guy a chance to talk, the story seemed right up my alley so I picked up the book the next day. Isn’t that why authors appear on talk shows, so that numb-nuts like me will rush to Borders?Percy Harrison Fawcett was the real-life explorer whose adventures Arthur Conan Doyle drew upon for his 1912 novel ‘The Lost Word.’ While Fawcett did not find a South American plateau populated with dinosaurs, he did lead numerous expeditions looking for lost civilizations. On his last and most ambitious—seeking the City of Z—he vanished. Over the past seventy-five years there have been hundreds of other expeditions into the Amazon, by a myriad of adventurers, looking for Percy Fawcett. All failed. Hundreds died. Many were never heard from again.Fawcett marked the end of an age. He was the last of the individualist explores. The day of the airplane, the radio, the organized and heavily financed modern expedition had not arrived. With him, it was the heroic story of a man against a vast uncharted wilderness nearly the size of the continental United States inhabited by deadly warriors.Armed with newly discovered information found in a trunk by one of Fawcett’s grandchildren the author, after completing exhaustive research, decides to enter the Amazon and follow the path of Fawcett’s last journey. This is a little eye-brow lifting because the author is a middle aged slightly chunky New Yorker who is the complete opposite of the rigorously trained, physically fit, handsome Fawcett. Thus the consequence of obsession, I guess.Throughout the nineteenth century there was a tremendous speculation concerning the ‘lesser’ civilizations and their inability to reach a level of sophistication beyond living in huts and foraging for food. Darwin did nothing to dispel this attitude—in fact, augmented it. Fawcett was unique in his vision and belief that remote jungle societies could indeed build out of stone, decipher the movements of the stars and create a written language. Without any concrete knowledge of its existence, he was determined to find proof, in the form of a magnificent stone city—he called Z—in the blank parts of the Amazon maps.For Fawcett’s final, and according to him ‘definitive’ 1925 excursion, instead of a group of hunter/explorers, he took only his twenty-one year old son Jack, and Jack’s companion Raleigh Rimell (who really wanted to go to Hollywood and become a silent movie star). For a while the trio sent native runners out of the jungle with progress reports. Their messages would be telegraphed to cities in the United States and eventually newspapers around the world published accounts of their progress. The world literally followed their escapades like a serial novel. Then everything stopped. And the world went nuts. Every major geographical society mounted rescue parties. Finding Fawcett Fever lasted for years. Even in the 1950’s there were rumors Fawcett was still alive and lording like a king over a remote tribe. In the 1960’s, rescue parties were mounted and sent into the wilds. More people died searching for Fawcett than looking for the headwaters of the Nile or panning gold in the Pacific northwest. It’s a pretty amazing story and a whopping good read. The author knows how to pace his story and exactly the right time to intersperse details of his own trek though the tropical forest.I have always wondered about these curious lines from ‘Othello”:And of the Cannibals that each other eat,The Anthropophagi, and men whose headsDo grow beneath their shoulders.It comes from an idea Shakespeare borrowed from Sir Walter Raleigh writing about Francisco de Orellana, whose expedition into the Amazon vanished in 1542. One of the many Christian xenophobes who contributed to slavery in the Western hemisphere. (Raleigh, not Shakespeare.)The author doesn’t have an ending and the story looses its momentum towards the end, but it is an intriguing story, well researched and a very interesting read. Completely enjoyable."

It was a worldwide publicized event, with Fawcett writing journal entries and having a messenger take them to the nearest large town to be sent via telegraph to the rest of the world. Then the entries suddenly stopped and Fawcett was never heard from again. Expeditions were made to discover what happened to them; nothing was ever found, while some more people were lost to the Amazon. The Lost City of Z is the story of Percy Fawcett, his life and how he became a great explorer, and where his obsession for the Amazon came from.

The Lost City of Z takes Grann all over the world, from visiting Fawcett’s great granddaughter and seeing some of his original journal entries, to putting together his own expedition to find out what really happened to Percy Fawcett. The Lost City of Z is the incredible story of one of the last explorers, but it is also the story of the strength of the human spirit and it’s drive to never give up.

I liked the format with the biographical and historical information interspersed with the authors research in libraries and archives, and shopping trips to adventure outfitters. How had I never heard of the Fawcett mystery until now? It seems like a story ripe for Hollywood or various adventure stories, so it is a wonder that it took this long to have some quality research on the topic (or have I just been ignorant of this?) Interesting aside - as I was reading this, my husband is reading Candice Millard's *River of Doubt* about Roosevelt's travels in Amazon. It was intriguing to hear the Grann citing that book, and for my husband and I to discuss the two expeditions and how they differed. I look forward to reading that book soon to continue my own little obsession with rainforest adventure stories...This book describes a very different Amazon than the one I encountered on my trip to Peru in 2007 - of course, I was not in the deepest darkest part of the forest, but we were ""roughing it"" by a lot of standards... I guess that is because over the last century there have been significant strides in public health and sanitation, disease prevention, and research on tropical climes... even in the author's travels in 2006 and 2007, he describes a very different Brazilian rainforest than Fawcett encountered 80 years prior.

Fawcett's British colonial background, his early years, other explorations, his family, his involvement in the Royal Geographical Society and the colonial and imperialist mix that was current in the late 19th and early 20th century in England ... it's all filler.Finally, finally, FINALLY the author takes the reader on his recent journey to the same area where Fawcett was last reported. The upshot is still that no one knows what happened, despite numerous attempts by numerous people to find out. The book ends with a short description of recent archaeological discoveries in the region that have uncovered much larger population centers and could have given rise to stories about an El Dorado or Z.That's it. The book could have been condensed into 50 pages and told exactly the same story."
292,0385513534,http://goodreads.com/user/show/131730-rj-from-the-lbc,4,"An explorer enters the Amazon jungle in search of a lost civilization: It's not an Indiana Jones movie but instead a true story about explorer Percy Fawcett who disappeared in 1925 while hunting for the ""forbidden city"" which he nicknamed ""Z."" Tragically, Fawcett never found Z...or did he? Legend has it Fawcett was killed or captured by hostile tribes, starved to death, or perhaps as some fringe groups believe he transcended mortality when he found and entered the lost city of Z. Journalist David Grann finds new information regarding Fawcett's secret route and eventually follows Fawcett into an area of the world that still remains largely unknown - and hostile - to outsiders. The Lost City of Z is often reminiscent of Susan Orlean's The Orchid Thief: A True Story of Beauty and Obsession - largely fascinating with the occasional dull patch or lack of focus. "
293,0385513534,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16407549-andrea-cox,2,"This was an okay book for me. It contains inappropriate pictures, associated with the lack of clothing on natives in the Amazon. Along with that, the descriptions in the book are sometimes more than I would have liked, whether it be about bodies, diseases, deaths, etc. There were many bizarre religions mentioned, including the occult.The adventure Fawcett must have thrived on throughout his life was evident in this book, and it's what kept me reading when the story went on a tangent, which happened often. It would have been much easier to read if the author had chosen either his own experiences or Fawcett's to focus on throughout, as the jumps from one POV to the next were quite jarring most of the time. However, I did enjoy learning about the various journeys taken by both men.This was an informative book. I am glad I read it, but I don't think I'll be reading it again.I was not compensated for my honest review."

295,0385513534,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1256603-sara,5,"You wouldn't think that a book featuring lost civilizations in the Amazon rain forest, cannibals, wild beasts, natives shooting poisoned arrows, mad men, and more man eating bugs then I ever want to encounter in a book ever again would best be described as subtle but such is the case with the totally wicked awesome Lost City of Z.David Grann, a reporter for the New Yorker, becomes intrigued by the story of Percy Fawcett an explorer in the early 1900's who became internationally famous for his forays into the Amazon rain forest with little more then a machete and an almost god like ability to survive even the most insane situations. In the course of his explorations Fawcett became obsessed with the idea of a lost civilization somewhere in the Amazon, a technologically and culturally advanced society hidden somewhere in the dense, impenetrable jungle. I'm not spoiling anything to let you know that Fawcett never found his city, which he mysteriously nicknamed ""Z,"" at 58 he took his 22 year old son and his son's best friend into the jungle determined to finally find it. The three men never returned and a legend was born.Over the years hundreds of would be rescuers and explorers have attempted to learn the fate of the last Fawcett expedition and/or discover Fawcett's fabled city.Grann joins their ranks and determines to journey there himself, leaving a wife and newborn son in New York City, to try to find the truth.There are two perfectly blended journey's here. Grann takes a ""no apologies"" approach in his exploration of Fawcett's life. We meet the tireless, obsessed explorer, negligent father and husband and the aggressive, easily offended bully who called anyone who couldn't match his 10 mile treks through unexplored jungle a ""coward."" Fawcett was certainly a thoroughly unlikable person but, as Grann takes pains to point out, its impossible to ignore his strength, dedication and intelligence. He changed the more time he spent in the Amazon among the tribes that lived there. He came to question the Victorian ""make the world England"" approach that was playing the same role the Spanish had years earlier in killing, subjugating and erasing the people who had thrived there for a thousand years. He fought bitterly against his own nature and that of his country to argue that ""savage"" was an abhorrent term perhaps best used to describe those attempting to ""civilize"" a people far beyond them already.Then we have Grann who through his own journey to the Amazon comes to understand that for all Fawcett's successes he lost site of those closest to him, those who needed him and depended upon him. He realizes that he too has become so blind to everything but this quest that he's abandoned his own family without a second thought.So yes, this is a book about crazy amazing adventures and secrets in the jungle and its amazingly exciting and so much fun to listen to at night right before bed. It really is like Indiana Jones comes to life (hell there's apparently an Indiana Jones novel ABOUT Fawcett and his city) but its also about what we lose when we put dreams ahead of everything else. Subtle and heart stopping. A nice combo it turns out."
296,0385513534,http://goodreads.com/user/show/83144-el,4,"I love a good yarn. I love those crazy stories about hidden treasures, travels to the ends of the earth, and driving obsessions - the more real they are, the better.In the Twenties, explorer Percy Fawcett wandered into the jungles of the Amazon to find the Lost City of Z, aka the ancient civilization, El Dorado. He was obsessed with the concept of this hidden civilization, and spent years researching and studying before embarking on his journey. But what happened? We know that most of his team died along the way, and that he sent his then 21-year-old son back home. But then the story ends basically, because Fawcett never made it out of the jungle. Was he driven to death by his own obsession? Was he eaten by a ginormous snake? Did he find the Lost City of Z and decide to just hang there for the rest of his days? David Grann picks up the story by not necessarily answering those questions, but by trying to follow in Fawcett's footsteps. Well... without that pesky ""getting-lost-in-the-Amazon-and-probably-dying"" thing.This is an engrossing story and totally fulfilled the wannabe archeologist I have inside, all the while reminding me that I would never last in the Amazon. It's hot, it's humid, there are bugs I've never even imagined (and I'm not being especially girly - I'm talking about mosquitoes that suck the juice off your eyeballs or those annoying things that basically get inside your junk and can not be removed), vampire bats, and did I mention the humidity? Yeah, it's not really a place that I could call home, but Fawcett apparently could, and Grann sure as heck could at least hang with the best of them. More power to those guys.Still, the bouncing back and forth between Grann's own expedition and that of Fawcett's was distracting at times. It would have been better if Grann just took one storyline and ran with it as they are singularly pretty fascinating. But Grann did a decent job of finding primary sources to back his (and Fawcett's) claims. My list of books to hunt down now has increased exponentially, and I suppose I can thank Grann for that, though I think it has more to do with the absolute craziness that possessed Fawcett that makes me want to know more about him."
297,0385513534,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4026072-kim,4,"I love travel and adventure and ancient civiliations so a real-life journey is a must-read for me. It is amazing how many people had invested time, money and, in some cases, their lives to search for a group that people said shouldn't have gone in the first place. Maybe if those people had helped fund the expedition they wouldn't have gone missing. Or as some conspiracies say maybe he wanted to go missing.But there's a part of me that would have also wanted to rush out looking for him. And that's the part that believes in the lost city of Z. Not the city of gold or the gilded man but the ancient civilization of the Amazon. The people and cities the original European explorers reported that were never seen again. And which science and archaeologists are finally confirming as being real. I would love to join the digs in South America, maybe one day I will.So why only 4 stars? The book is too short. I know it was originally written as an article and then extended but it was over too quick. I was really getting into the story and the discoveries when it finished. Now I'll have to find more books on the subject."
298,0385513534,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18377898-marjorie,4,"I read this book to build anticipation for an upcoming trip to Colombia. Little did I know, it is NOT that kind of book. Grann's descriptions of all the horrible ways the Amazon can invade the body make me never want to stand in a forest again. However, the book did end on a good note: in awe of the great unknown civilizations that not only survive but thrived in the Amazon. I also found Grann's portrayal of the individuals that journeyed into the Amazon (and the people they left behind) interesting enough in themselves. What kind of people are compelled again and again to enter into a lonely hell? "
299,0385513534,http://goodreads.com/user/show/795695-jennifer-ozawa,4,"Enjoyed this. It reminded me of Erik Larson's books, but with ""Julie and Julia"" for good measure. "
