0,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6938150-marie-paule,5,"An amazing book about how modern DNA techniques contribute to anthropological and (pre-)historical research. DNA-research tells us that the European population is the result of three important migration waves: a) a migration of hunters-gatherers (coming from Africa) as a result of the ice ages;b) agriculture is not a result of a naturally occuring 'evolution' in several populations of hunters. Agriculture arose at one specific time in one specific area, viz. the surroundings of Syria. Once farmers needed more farming land, they started to migrate from the 'south to the north' (6000 BC.);c) around 2800 BC, large groups of shepherds migrated from the drylands in the east (Russia etc). Here, DNA-research is in line with the findings of linguistic studies (Indo-European languages).These are the three main immigration waves, but of course, a lot of economical and political factors have added additional 'layers' to this general picture, e.g. the Vikings coming to Western Europe. Even in prehistorical eras, commerce and ships have played a far more important role in the development of Europe, than I could have imagined.This book also gives an interesting insight in the appearance of dogs, horses and cats in human existence. And last but not least, the author makes some interesting ethical remarks about do's and don'ts when we are dealing with genetic research in an anthropological setting.I dare to recommend this book to my fellow GR-friends !"

Karin Bojs is an experienced science journalist and writes well - her look into the development of what Europeans are and where they came from is both personal and universal.The essence of it is clear: Europeans are all immigrants, in the end, a mixture of hunterer-gatherers who arrived first, the farmers who arrived later and the steppe nomads who were the last to arrive. Mix in some Neanderthal blood in it, and there you go, the variety of Europeans who live in Europe today."

According to himself, he of course is a pure breed, but Samis and Jews are not.Well, dear Björn, I’m sorry to inform you that none of us are pure breeds. We’re all Africans, spiced up with a little Neanderthal.The first ”Swedes” were hunters, and they arrived from the European continent just after the last deglaciation, more than 10,000 years ago. Their hair and skin were dark, and their eyes probably blue. A couple of thousand years later the first light skinned and brown-eyed farmers arrived from - wait for it - Syria. How does that make you feel, Björn? Having Syrian genes, I mean? Then, about 5,000 years ago a new wave of indoeuropean immigrants came from Central Asia. You know, Björn, those people you think are superior to others.What about the Samis then? The first arrived from northeast just after the deglaciation. Then there was a second immigration wave between 2,000 and 3,000 years ago. Numerous groups have come since then. All have lived side by side and exchanged genes with each other.And Björn, if a may ask a personal question: My very blonde and blue-eyed aunt, who has converted to Judaism - is she a real Swede?Lesson learned: When cultures meet and interact generally great progress is made."
3,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15045505-michael-bafford,4,"This was very interesting. It seems that DNA research is answering questions deemed unanswerable not that long ago. It also raises at least as many new questions, but hey, that's science. We are all descended from Mitochondrial Eve who lived in Africa about 200,000 years ago. Before Eve people were not like us; were not ""modern"" humans, not homo-sapiens. I find it intriguing to wonder what triggered the mutation that gave Eve that slight advantage which, in the end, won out over every other human type. I happened across a lecture on You-tube where the answer was aliens. Not that surprising, I suppose. Maybe it was God, or an accident?This story hops forward a bit to 54,000 years ago when some of our ancestors somewhere in the middle east were raped - probably - by Neanderthals. Or maybe they were just into beefy guys. I find it exciting to learn that I have at least 2% Neanderthal in me; as does everybody else. What was also interesting was how, with DNA technique, it is possible to trace the invasion of Europe. The native Europeans - the Neanderthals - disappeared shortly thereafter. Shortly, in a relative, prehistory, perspective. They had been living here already for over 200,000 years when we arrived, but... A second wave of emigrants left the fertile crescent and came wandering up into Europe about 9,000 years ago, bringing bronze, farming, farm animals, ceramics and cats. Archaeologists would apparently rather not believe that farming was brought by immigrants; assuming rather that the knowledge was passed on culturally, but dead men tell the tale. Actually, it's mostly dead women. I learned more about DNA here than I really wanted to know, but it probably did me good. And a final wave of immigrants - invaders? - came from the East a mere 5,000 years ago, probably in better boats, riding on horses and speaking an Indo-European language. Thre are some things I take issue with. Ms. Bojs' interpretation of a rock carving from Vitlycke in which she sees a man holding a hammer, with a lightning bolt in front of him, riding in a cart pulled by a horse, for example. I can't say I see it that way. Another interpretation is that the cart is drawn by a goat - compare the Thor mythology. To me the lightning bolt looks like a snake, the hammer seems just to be a disfigured hand and the man seems to have antlers. But what do I know. I have always thought the ""boats"" look like sledges. That men were generally erect seems pretty certain - and that girls wore pony-tails is for sure.The personal side of the story with Ms. Bojs' travels and meetings was a nice change from the hard facts. And at times I find her insights enlightening. As in the chapter ""The Mothers"" discussing Dawkins: The Selfish Gene. ""Rather than ""selfish genes"" I would like to speak of ""double genes"". Genes may be good or bad, depending on the environment in which they occur. They can lead to mental illness or great creativity. To ample flesh that allows survival in an austere environment but a risk for overweight when food is in abundance. Hyper-sensitivity to impressions helps the hunter discover the prey, but can be devastating in classrooms and offices. What is good and bad depends on the combination and the context. (p. 414-15, translation by Google and me).The book also contains tips to museums and ancient sites and caves. Recommended to all students of human history."

5,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56815627-b-jean,4,"When I first picked up this book, I had a different image in mind about what it would be about. Perhaps more anecdotal, or concerned only with her direct ancestors. Maybe it would be a lot of guesswork & stipulation.I wasn't expecting her to be a science journalist who interviewed over 70 different researchers and was funded to write this by a leading Swedish journal. I also didn't expect to be given such a lovely introduction into DNA archaeology. I'd never made the connection between DNA & archaeology before this because I simply didn't think about it. This book opened my mind to all the possibilities and benefits this field offers to understanding the history of humankind. This book goes way back...waaay back. Now I know more about neanderthals than I did before. Really, it was so full of information that it was hard to digest at first. The further I got into it, the easier it became to understand. Also, I was so fortunate to take a trip to Ireland while reading this book and I got to see some bog bodies for myself. I loved looking up all the historic bodies & archaeological finds that were cited in the book. It was great to have seen the pictures on google and then to see some of the bodies in person at the National Museum. I also appreciate that she added in the dangers of racial biology & how racists shouldn't stop our understanding of DNA. As she quoted in the book, ‘We can’t let Hitler dictate what subjects we can research, 50 years on.’ This gave me a great new direction to take my interests in, so hopefully I'll be reading up on burials & neanderthals & other such matters soon.

7,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1555052-helen,5,"I found the book fascinating how the author went on a search of her ancestry and traced it so far back by looking at her DNA. She takes on a trip of where her ancestors have been by travelling to a number of European countries and interviewing a number of researchers. What is interesting is how she explained what life must have been like for the people at that time, what people ate, how they lived. Through DNA research it shows that there were three major waves of migration - during the ice age, when the farmers came from the Middle East, namely Syria, and then the Steppes. The migration took place not only on foot but by boat as well.It is interesting how humans had to deal with harsh environments, disease which wiped out 1/2 of the population (plagues), enemies, change in diet and how some groups of people were able to survive and pass on their DNA. How interesting that some people in Iceland have in their DNA mitochondria belonging to a group descended from an indigenous group in America. One thing I thought she should have questioned id the oldest flute found in a cave in Slovenia that has been dismissed as being made by a hyena. You do not need to be a researcher to know that if an animal bites a bone it will not make a perfect circle on only one side."
8,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5861984-judyta-szaci-o,4,"I very much enjoyed this book even though I'm not really used to reading about science in a journalistic style. Journalists use many details that are supposed to make the narrative more lively - like what the weather was or what they were drinking when interviewing a person, or what's the latest gossip about work relationships between researchers going sour... I found it redundant and slightly annoying, but there's not too much of it in this book and it did not deter me from reading. The main matter is fascinating, and the author's rich imagination was a boost to my own - there are several imagined scenes of our prehistorical ancestors' travels and meetings, which make the whole story much more alive. I did get lost in some of the terminology in the end - couldn't possibly remember the names of all haplogroups, them being just strings of seemingly random numbers and letters - but that didn't affect my ability to follow the arguments as the narrative is otherwise very accessible to an amateur reader. Last but not least, the author's sensitivity to the beauty of landscapes shines throughout the book and makes the whole reading experience that much more real. Thank you, Karin, I've had a great time with your book!"

11,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5606654-deb,5,"An amazing book about how today's developing DNA techniques contribute to understanding our common humanness! I definitely will read a second (maybe third!) time.Bojs explained that the European continent experienced three homo sapien migration waves: 1st the hunters-gatherers OOA (out of Africa) as a result of the ice ages. They met up with Neandrathals in their middle east trek. 2nd around 6000BC, the farmers and their agriculture migrated to Europe. DNA now shows that farming was not a result of naturally occurring expertise in populations of hunters. Instead, agriculture arose at one specific time in one specific area, the border of today's Turkey and Syria. Once farmers needed more farming land, they started to migrate from the 'south to the north.' 3rd Around 2800 BC (around 5000 years ago), large groups of shepherds migrated from the drylands in the east (Russia etc). Here, DNA-research is in line with the findings of linguistic studies (Indo-European languages). That wave of immigrants - invaders? - came from the East probably in better boats, riding on horses and speaking an Indo-European language. Bojs' careful explanation and scientific DNA data show that Europeans are all immigrants, in the end, a mixture of hunterer-gatherers who arrived first, the farmers who arrived later and the steppe nomads who were the last to arrive. Plus, mix in some Neanderthal blood in it and you have most of the Europeans today.Bojs also focused on Swedes. The first ""Swedes” were hunters who arrived from the European continent just after the last deglaciation, more than 10,000 years ago. Their hair and skin were dark, and their eyes probably blue. A couple of thousand years later the first light skinned and brown-eyed farmers arrived from the area around Syria. Then, about 5,000 years ago a new wave of immigrants came from the Central Asia steppes. Bojs introduced the Scandanavian roots to Samis whose common foremother was probably in northern Spain/sourthern France 18,000 ya and arrived in Sweden area just after deglaciation. But, some Sami have DNA from populations in the Urals/Volga region of Russia that arrived in Finland and Scandanavia 6,000 ya. It is complicated, and deserves a second read.I will remember Bojs pointing out ""two-face genes."" Genes may be good or bad, depending on the environment in which they occur. They can lead to mental illness or great creativity. To ""well-filled physique"" that assures survival in an austere environment but a risk for overweight when food is in abundance. Hyper-sensitivity helps the hunter discover the prey, but can be devastating in classrooms and offices. ""What is good and bad depends on the combination and the context.""There are TONS of tips to wonderful museums all over Europe!"
12,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18702398-piet-boels,4,"I liked this book but only for a subset of the subjects it set out to address in the first place. Bojs, as a long-time and competent science-correspondent of the Swedish broadsheet Dagens Nyheter, an independent, middle of the road, quality newspaper owned by the Bonnier family, appears at times to be a wide-eyed Alice in the wonderland of DNA-archaeology while at other times she adopts a much more endearing and appropriate role of hard-nosed sleuth. In its overall structure, the book is a diary of family-tree research done both in the classic way of archival digging (which in Sweden is probably nowadays replaced by mouse-clicking rather than exposing yourself to future dust- or mold-induced lung disease) and the modern way of DNA-profiling. Where the story is immersive, interesting and revealing is in the drawing together of climate- and DNA-archaeology with the classical archaeological evidence regarding the populating of the European continent with consecutive different peoples and cultures. Karin Bojs magisterially weaves first-hand accounts from experts in the field (Svante Pääbo deservedly appears at several moments in the book) together with a wide and deep-going knowledge and understanding of the relevant primary literature into a –well yes, why not?– “ripping yarn”. This is popularising science-writing at its best, also because she does not shy away from reporting the vicious infighting that occur at times in the archaeological scientific community. It is fascinating to read (and in my case learn) about the mechanics of the spreading of agricultural, ceramic, stone and metal technologies. It is thought-provoking (and should provoke further research as well) that a person in Sweden can carry DNA-traces pointing to descendency from various different migratory peoples, be they coming 1000s of years ago from an area corresponding currently to the Syrian-Turkish borderlands or 100s of years ago from Scotland or Ireland. Where the story becomes parochial is whether there may be evidence for descendency from 17th century Finnish migrants into Sweden or where exactly, for the last 10 generations, different members of her family were living, moving to or moving from. Why there is the slightly patronising chapter on Hitler's and Stalin's propagandizing misuse of genetics is anybody's guess. The book could have included a register."
13,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15588590-skalman71,2,"I enjoyed learning about the techniques a lot, and see what we can find out about ourselves these days and the language is good. Unfortunately, the book focused a little too much on Bojs herself (a bit I expected since you have to have a reference point, but not for it to dominate like it did). Moreover, she tended to accept some scientific research, and discard other just like that, so how am I supposed to know what to believe? Too much subjectivity, coupled with the fact that more (contradictory) scientific research was released as I was reading this. "

Next time I go I'll keep that in mind as an alternative to ruins, castles, and paintings.Cons:- Last two chapters transition from broad history to personal biography of her family which is utterly uninteresting. At least it is ready to skip. - The flip side of readability is that some things are perhaps simplified a bit. She makes the progression of cultures seem awfully clear and orderly, especially in the deep past. - While the author does quite a bit if acknowledging things we don't know for sure, she often then follows up with an elaboration of what she just wants to believe (often based on a viable theory by serious researchers but still speculative and unproven). Note, I actually don't mind the brief explicitly speculative vignettes of ancient peoples added for color and imagery.- As with all books on this subject, there is considerable text spent on disclaimers to distance anything here from Nazis, eugenecists, and other such taboos. I'm not in danger of reading things that way, so the disclaimers are just tedious for me."
19,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58935752-morten,3,"Karin Bojs has an impressive overview and draws from many intervies and travels around Europe, when written this compact presentation of 'current' research on human migration to and around in Europe. By viewing the history of Europe from her own family tree the story becomes relevant and interesting and gives some ties to the broad list of research that Karin Bojs are presenting. The book covers slightly too many topics, and at times it seems like Karin Bojs should have done a more substantial selection of stories, or dig deeper into the research. Then it seems more like a collection of articles from the science section of a newspaper, than a comprehensive story compiled into a compact book. It covers enough relevant results that it is an interesting read and relevant for everybody to learn about the current best guess about the story of europeans."
20,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7125174-michael,4," The book covers the archaeology behind early humanity's migrations into Europe and the rest of the Eurasian continent, but mainly concentrates on the expansion of DNA testing as a tool to help answer questions such as ""did agriculture begin at several locations concurrently or did it begin in one location and spread from there?""Karin's focus is primarily on Sweden and her own family line, but that shouldn't be a limiting factor to reading the book. If a general understanding of the science behind DNA testing (such as the increasingly popular Ancestry.com and 23andMe versions) interests you, and you're wondering how this works with archaeology and early humanity, then this is a good book to read.
