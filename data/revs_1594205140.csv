They put copper, lead, formaldehyde and so much more in our food. Kids died from drinking milk. That’s so mind boggling that I had to reread the paragraphs focused on that. Paragraphs, plural, because it HAPPENED MORE THAN ONCE OVER SEVERAL YEARS. This author does an amazing job of compiling all of the information together in a cohesive form. There’s a inordinate amount of information within these pages and while it can get a bit dense and repetitive, it never lost my interest. I’m so glad I had the opportunity to read it and I’m going to make damn sure everybody knows to read it. FIGHT THE MAN!(Or just hold corporations like Coca-Cola accountable)"
1,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,5,"This is an amazing book about Dr. Harvey Wiley, a chemist in the Department of Agriculture at the turn of the century. He worked tirelessly to keep food and beverages safe for consumption. A hundred years ago, adulterated food products were very common. Unhealthful--or even poisonous--additives stretched the volume of foods, making them devoid of nutrition, and even harmful. Sometimes the additives were employed to stretch the apparent volume of products. Sometimes the additives were used to prolong shelf life. Sometimes the foods were deliberately mislabeled, to trick consumers. And, some foods were processed under very unsanitary conditions. It was a very big problem. And it could be argued that the problem still exists.While Theodore Roosevelt was president, the first law was passed, aimed at these problems. The Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906 was passed was passed, to help ameliorate these problems. However, the law did not, by itself, fix any problems. The Department of Agriculture was still in bed with food manufacturers. And, there was no proof that food additives or adulterants were dangerous to health. And, in order to prohibit a manufacturer from adding a chemical to foods, it was necessary to first prove that the chemical was dangerous to health.Harvey Wiley, the head of the chemistry division at the Department of Agriculture, was the leading proponent of food safety and honesty in labeling. He formed what was known as the ""Poison Squad"". He had some rooms in the basement fixed up like a restaurant. He invited healthy civil servants to be served free meals there. Participants were admonished to eat breakfast, lunch and dinner at this location, and to eat nothing at any other location. Of course, free meals were a big attraction, but they realized that they would be participating in nutrition experiments. The cooks added different concentrations of food additives, with the purpose of determining who would get sick. These experiments showed that certain food additives were clearly dangerous, and therefore prohibited from use.Wiley's efforts at upholding the safety of foods made him a nationwide hero in the eyes of women. He had to constantly battle against the Secretary of Agriculture, who very frequently sided with food producers instead of siding with food safety. But Wiley's popularity made it difficult to fire him, although firing was attempted several times.This book is about the courage of this man who stood for food safety and honesty, above all else. It was an enjoyable read, engaging, and full of surprises. But, I didn't read this book--I listened to the audiobook. It is narrated very nicely by Kirsten Potter. I listened to the book while taking long walks from Arlington to Theodore Roosevelt Island. And the most amazing experience occurred while listening to the discussions between Harvey Wiley and Theodore Roosevelt, while viewing the super-sized statue of Theodore Roosevelt! The central circle on the island is ornamented by Roosevelt's statue and chiseled quotes by Roosevelt that show how progressive he was for his times. What a treat!"
2,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61946844-amy,5,"During his successful 2016 campaign for the White House, Trump promised to have his cabinet ""submit a list of every wasteful and unnecessary regulation which kills jobs, and which does not improve public safety, and eliminate them."" His FDA commission, Scott Gottlieb, followed that promise by saying what while he recognizes the importance of food safety legislation he wants to ""strike the right balance"" in its implementation. Consumer groups now anticipate delayed and reduced protections from agencies facing deep budget cuts. The Earthjustice Institute has warned of the ""Trump administration's willingness to accommodate even unfounded and partial industry opposition to the detriment of the health and welfare of people and families across the country.""Such a warning, with its mix of theatrical anger and genuine dismay could have been written, almost word for word, by Harvey Washington Wiley more than a century ago. The sense of deja vu, echoing down the years, should remind us of the ways that food safety practices have dramatically changed in this country--and of the ways they have changed hardly at all. (The Poison Squad, pg. 289)I found this book while browsing in my local library and picked it up because public health is always an interesting topic to me. It took me a little while to get started on this book, but once I did I could hardly put it down. The Poison Squad follows Dr. Harvey Washington Wiley in his career primarily as chief chemist for the Department of Agriculture, explains how his research on altered and deliberately unlabeled/mislabeled products came to shape his advocacy for safe and pure (or, at the very least, properly labeled) food and drink, and illustrates for readers the parallels between the complaints and schemes of business of decades ago and the complaints and schemes of business today. Just like the Earthjustice statement could have been written by Dr. Wiley, The Poison Squad is littered with quotations from 19th and 20th century businessmen, their lawyers, and the their lobbyists, that could be written - word for word - by the industry-at-any-cost interests of today. I knew about a couple of the cases cited in the text - the poisoning of children with milk that had been 'preserved' with formaldehyde, the mass poisoning of mainly children by Elixir Sulfanilamide - but not the vast majority. Well written, informative, and very, very relevant, The Poison Squad was an amazing book and it is one that I would highly recommend. However, given that a good many of the descriptions are graphic, I have one caveat: I would try not to recommend The Poison Squad to someone who didn't have at least an ok tolerance for nauseating descriptions, the likes of which are extremely likely to cause intense revulsion at the very idea of some things once being considered 'food.' For example: Doctors continued to worry over continued reports of ""grocer's itch,"" a side effect of the deceptive practice of grinding up insects and passing the result off as brown sugar. Sometimes live lice survived the process. (The Poison Squad, pg. 66)The secretary [of agriculture, Wilson] also had endorsed a November decision to seize fifty-two industrial-sized cans of eggs preserved in a 2 percent solution of boracic acid. The Hipolite Egg Company of St. Louis sold these huge cans--forty-two pounds each--to the baking industry at a price much lower than fresh eggs. Hipolite specialized in salvaging dirty, cracked, and even rotting eggs for use in breads and cakes. The company was particularly known for using ""spots"" (decomposing eggs); mixing their contents into a thick, homogeneous mass; using boracic acid, a by-product of borax [the cleaning product also used for pest control] to halt further decomposition; and then selling the eggy soup by the can. (The Poison Squad, pg. 203)New options [for coloring agents] arose with synthetic dyes made from coal tars--dense, chemically complex residues left over the processing of coal...The new dyes were durable, cheap, and potent--and rapidly adopted by industrial processors of everything from fabric to food. (The Poison Squad, pg. 229)The organizers [of the pure food exhibit] decided to exhibit two thousand different brands presenting tainted food and drink sold in the United States. ...Minnesota and South Dakota sent sheets of silk and wool, each five feet square, brilliantly colored with coal-tar dyes extracted from a variety of strawberry syrups, ketchup, jams and jellies, and red wine. Michigan sent samples of lemon extract in which the manufacturer had used cheap but deadly wood alcohol as a base. Illinois provided more faked extracts, such as ""vanilla"" made only of alcohol and brown food coloring...Participating states provided forty brands of ketchup, labeled as a tomato product, that were mostly stewed pumpkin rind dyed red, and some fifty brands of baking powder that were largely well-ground chalk enhanced by aluminum compounds. To the fury of food industry executives, the fair's head of publicity, Mark Bennett, send out a news release titled ""Lessons in Food Poisoning,"" which noted: ""If you want to have your faith in mankind rather rudely shaken, take the time to look about in the exhibit of the State Food Commissioners in the south end of the Palace of Agriculture."" (The Poison Squad, pg. 115)This is a small sampling of just what I could easily find and could be easily understood from a relatively short quote. I personally think the text is all the better for including these details; they do not allow industry malpractice and unethical behavior to hide behind the veneer of polite wording. I think it is necessary the same way that Upton Sinclair's graphic descriptions of the Chicago stockyards and packing plants were necessary (The Jungle, as well as other information about it and the yards themselves are also quoted, by the way). But, because I know not everyone has the same opinion as me, I would try to take into account personal taste when making - or choosing not to make - a recommendation."
3,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/216284-mark,5,"Another superb book by Deborah Blum. Like her previous book, The Poisoner's Handbook, Blum dives deep into our recent past to show how different we were in some ways just a century ago, and yet how alike we are in many respects.The Poisoner's Handbook told the story of the birth of forensic science, along with the frighteningly common availability of murderous poisons in the early 1900s. The Poison Squad tells the story of the birth of pure food and drug laws in the United States, led largely by a single iron-willed man, Harvey Washington Wiley, although he had a lot of help from crusading reformers, muckraking journalists and state food inspectors.Wiley came of age in the late 1800s, when the desire of food manufacturers to provide cheap products in an age before refrigeration caused them to dose their food with preservatives that seem almost ludicrously dangerous today --borax, sodium benzoate, and even formaldehyde. For purely deceptive purposes, they also produced ketchup with no tomatoes, coffee with no coffee, and whiskey with no whiskey. At a time when American activists were seeking reform on many fronts -- women the right to vote, temperance committees a ban on alcohol, Teddy Roosevelt an attack on monopolies -- the pure food movement became another plank in this broad reformist effort, and Wiley was its leading figure.The title of the book comes from an experiment that Wiley put together while running the Bureau of Chemistry in the Department of Agriculture, which for ethical reasons might never occur today. To test how safe various preservatives were, he recruited volunteers -- mostly young single men working for the federal government -- and put them on a strictly regulated diet, with some in the group getting regular food and others adding capsules of whatever preservative he was studying. By doing this, Wiley was able to show the dangers of substances like sodium benzoate and formaldehyde -- none of his young men died, but some got very sick -- and refute the arguments of manufacturers that the preservatives were harmless.After years of campaigning, both through his bureau's careful testing and through his charismatic speaking appearances, Wiley finally managed to persuade Congress and President Roosevelt to pass a pure food and drug act. But once the bill was signed into law in 1906, the manufacturers did everything in their power to dilute it, and years of fighting and court battles remained ahead.Throughout most of this period, Wiley was saddled with a particular burden. His boss, Agriculture Secretary James Wilson, served under four presidents and was so industry-friendly that he blunted much of what Wiley was able to do, prohibiting him from publishing scientific findings, blocking him from speaking appearances, and finally appointing a special committee that had the power to overrule many of Wiley's recommendations.Despite all those roadblocks, Wiley became enormously popular both within his agency and with the broader public, and when he finally decided to leave government service, he was given a prominent position and much higher pay as a consultant and author for Good Housekeeping, then a powerhouse magazine for America's educated women.The magic Blum brings to these books is her ability to take government reports, transcripts of testimony and court hearings and other dusty tomes and bring them to life, infusing this critical change in our attitudes toward government regulation with humanity and drama. And while we no longer face borax and formaldehyde in our food, the elemental struggle between businesses trying to get away with whatever they can for profit, vs. the government preventing their worst excesses through regulation, remains just as powerful an issue today as it did when the Pure Food and Drug law was passed.Highly recommended."

5,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25032671-kris,3,"This book focuses on chemicals like formaldehyde, sodium benzoate, Borax, and strong acids and dyes. There's also mention of arsenic, led, mercury, and copper. I wanted a little more about foods laced with blatantly crazy drugs we still think of today —like morphine, cocaine, and heroine.It sounds like these drugs were harming people, but the field was so new there wasn't documented evidence and studies to prove it beyond doubt. Once the research got started, it was damning. I was fascinated by the fact that volunteers willingly ingested poison for weeks on end just to help a scientist prove this stuff.Even the strongest conservative has to admit the government's role is to protect people from harm. And this stuff harmed. It isn't a question of enforcing regulation to protect health, it's a question of how much regulation is needed to protect health. It's obvious some kind of regulation was sorely needed during these times.But it's a far cry from the regulations on the books today. Blum would have you believe there's no difference between 1910 and 2010. Her leftist bias is clear, and every once in a while her voice pops out to pester at you annoyingly from the page (...Shame on those people who dare try to reduce regulations... It's so obvious you should think the way I do... How dare Trump do x, y, and z...). Blegh. This was clearly written in a post-Trump era. Luckily her bias was occasional, easy enough to spot, then proceed to ignore.I do wonder if people 50 or 100 years from now will look back at all the chemicals in our processed junk foods, alongside the increased rates of cancer, and call us crazy too.I also want to read:Pandora's Lunchbox: How Processed Food Took Over the American Meal"
6,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1889783-emily,3,"This author's previous book is one of the most popular I've encountered, in that everyone I know who's read it, loved it. It was about the emergence of forensic medicine (and solving poisoning cases) against the backdrop of Prohibition-era New York. In this work she takes on a scientifically similar topic with a good deal less surrounding jazz and excitement. Early in the twentieth century, the food supply was far from the bucolic ideal we might imagine having existed before the emergence of junk food and factory farms. In fact, food purveyors regularly adulterated foods with all sorts of disgusting bulking materials, or added toxic substances like arsenic to achieve bright colors. Some foods were straight-up fakes. The book is full of hair-raising examples. For example, milk producers wanted to stretch their production. ""The standard recipe was a pint of lukewarm water to every quart of milk—after the cream had been skimmed off. To improve the bluish look of the remaining liquid, milk producers learned to add whitening agents such as plaster of paris or chalk. Sometimes they added a dollop of molasses to give the liquid a more golden, creamy color. To mimic the expected layer of cream on top, they might also add a final squirt of something yellowish, occasionally pureed calf brains."" (loc 236). ""Cloves"" were made of burned seashells or ""pepper"" from charcoal and sawdust--and there were few laws restricting any of these practices. Children were poisoned by milk ""preserved"" with formaldehyde.The main figure here is Dr. Harvey Wiley, who tried to use his role at the Agriculture Department to research food safety and bring about legislation to protect Americans' health. The fundamental problem with this book is that Wiley's career was long and slow-moving, full of bureaucratic maneuvers that don't exactly leap of the page like the juicy revenge poisonings in Blum's previous book. In his personal life, Wiley also romanced a librarian from the Library of Congress, which reads like a painfully prolonged case of mild sexual harassment culminating in the lady taking stock of her independent economic prospects and marrying him. Blum's writing, research, and story-telling are still well-done--this is just a topic that's going to appeal to fewer, and only more patient readers."
7,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2141142-marieka,2,"This didn’t draw me in like I thought that it would. I generally tear through this type of book, but I’m maybe 5/6 of the way through and stuck, and I’m considering leaving it unfinished. Maybe it’s that it focuses too much on Dr. Wiley and goes into too much detail? I can’t nail down what exactly my issue with this book was, but I was somehow disappointed."
8,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/80750585-claudia,5,"Today, when talking about the safety of our food, we are concerned with MSG; high-fructose corn syrup; trans fats, synthetic sweeteners, artificial colors among others. In the late 1800's into the early years of the twentieth century, you would have been concerned more about arsenic, formaldehyde (yes, embalming fluid); salicylic acid, copper sulfate, and borax being used as preservatives. Coal-tar dyes to make the food appear fresh and bright. Saccharin to replace the more expensive sugar. Acetic acid replacing lemon juice. So-called neutral spirits colored, flavored and called whiskey. Nitrites to bleach flour to brilliant whiteness. Lead and a variety of minerals in candy. It is suspected that hundreds if not thousands of young children were killed by milk that was more chemical than dairy - the recipe could be a pint of water to each quart of milk after the cream was skimmed off. Add a bit of chalk or plaster of paris for whitening. Molasses to give it a golden color and to replace the cream, a squirt of something that may include pureed calf brains. And don't forget the formaldehyde! Yummy, isn't it? You don't want to know what could be in butter.Food manufacturers were certainly inventive with their additives. Sometimes the only thing missing in the product was what it was advertised and sold as. Of course, what it could include was mashed fruit and vegetable leavings. Charred rope. Sawdust. Crushed nut shells, ground insects and floor sweepings of all kinds. This book is about Dr. Harvey Washington Wiley, a chemist in the employ of the federal Department of Agriculture (the infant FDA) and his fight to eliminate toxic minerals and chemicals from the foods available to the American people. The same chemicals/additives, which were forbidden for use in Europe and Canada, flooded American food.And it was a long, exhausting fight. Utilizing the resources available, Wiley would create his 'poison squads' which would be volunteers who would take in the chemical investigated over a period of time and record any negative impacts on their health. The data would be analyzed and the report released to the public.Of course, the manufacturers fought hard and long. They were all about using cheaper materials instead of authentic, pure food products. Most were certainly were not willing to make the product a few cents more expensive but without toxic additives. But Dr. Wiley had his supporters as well - the AMA, women's groups, several Congressmen and Senators, various state-level secretaries of agriculture, newspaper journalists especially after the publication of Upton Sinclair's The Jungle which blew the lid off the meatpacking industry of Chicago. Fanny Farmer and her famous cookbook. H.J. Heinz that proved that food could be uncontaminated, tasty and appealing to the buying public.1906 saw the passage of the Pure Food and Drug Act but food industry lobbyists managed to convince industry-friendly politicians to basically weaken and gut the law. But it was a start and Dr. Wiley eventually lost his neutrality in his crusade for unadulterated and safe food which caused tension within the Department of Agriculture. Taking on Coca Cola for their cocaine and caffeine. Taking on the whiskey manufacturers. Saccharin and bread whitening agents.In the end, Dr. Wiley felt the best decision for him and his family was to continue his crusade through a job offered by Good Housekeeping magazine. He never saw the modified Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act of 1938 which corrected the Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906. Unfortunately, it took the death of more than a 100 people who were poisoned and killed by cough syrup sweetened by antifreeze. This is a vital book to read. Not just because of how far food safety has advanced over the years but how much more work needs to be done. Additional laws and updates to food and drug regulation over the years is in danger from our current administration as Trump promised to eliminate every unnecessary regulation and it seems that the FDA and its work is once again under fire. Only time will tell if it survives or is stripped of its authority and dominion."
9,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2527265-david,4,"It is heartening to see this excellent new history getting favorable attention on the radio, in newspapers, in online journals, and in both food blogs and science blogs.In addition, there are already many reviews here on Goodreads that adequately summarize and elaborate on this book's fine qualities, so I thought I would allow myself the freedom to write a few words about what the century-old struggle for safer food in the US has to say about current unpleasantness. There are many similarities.It's hard to believe that anyone would construe the liberties we enjoy in the United States as permission to introduce known poisons, insect body parts, rodent excretia, etc., into food, but that's exactly what many food manufactures, big and small, did. Furthermore, attempts to limit known poisons, etc., from the food supply were treated as outrageous examples of government overreach and hysterical attention-seeking. Of course, from this distance, the champions of such “freedoms” look like the villains they were, and their arguments ring extremely hollow. We can only hope that people will be around in a century to give today's analogs the ridicule they richly deserve. Now, of course, the stakes are higher. Instead of simply poisoning an entire country, today's villains have the opportunity to wreck the whole world.This book also reminds how difficult it is to do the right thing. There are many pitfalls. For example, the book's splendidly cantankerous hero, log-cabin-born chemist Harvey Washington Wiley, was a thorn in the side of corner-cutters and quacks of all varieties well into his ninth decade. However, like a lot of people in the do-gooding business, he occasionally loses focus of the main goal and wastes precious time and resources on fringe issues. Wiley, for example, was an enthusiastic consumer of bourbon and pursued a strict definition of what type of restorative should be allowed to bear that proud label. I have been known to favor an occasional snort myself, so I appreciate his enthusiasm, but I recognize bourbon is (as is often said here in The Nation's Capital) not the hill you want to die on. Defending the purity of milk, flour, canned goods, etc., brings a rosy glow of mother- and baby-protecting saintliness to your advocacy. Bourbon – not so much. There are only so many hours in a day, so many battles you can fight. Choose wisely.Speaking of choosing your battles: Wiley knew that his cause was just, and he was for much of his life the smartest person in the room. As a result, he tended to shoot off his mouth and (another Nation's Capital cliché coming up) not suffer fools gladly. Most of the time, people who really needed defending benefitted from this tendency, but when you are in the room with the President of the United States, it's often wise to choose your words carefully, even if (perhaps especially when) the President is a bit of a tool. In Wiley's case, he unnecessarily alienated the affections of Theodore Roosevelt. The consequences were not disastrous, but even Wiley himself admitted that it would have been wiser to keep his trap shut. Finally, remember: the struggle never ends. It's natural enough, when long work results in success, to take a moment out to do a triumphant happy-dance, but remember while shaking what God gave you that your opponents are already looking for ways to roll back your improvements and undermine your good works. As happens similarly today, evil lawyerly minions who opposed Wiley managed to change the wording of legislation and rule-making so that strict guidelines were replaced with weasel words (e.g., “The guidelines now merely banned an undefined 'excessive' amount” (Kindle location 2430)). These words can then be litigated into meaninglessness, and/or cost pesky do-gooders a small mountain of legal fees.This is a fine book about a man whose life work benefitted others. In his lifetime, he received a certain amount of fame and monetary reward for his selflessness, but now he is largely forgotten, while names of murderous racists of the same period and earlier still grace our high schools and highways, and their graven images still infest our parks and public lands. Read this and remember someone worth remembering. I received a free electronic advance review copy of this book via Netgalley and Penguin Random House."
10,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1462387-karyl,4,"I saw this for sale at B&N and was immediately drawn to it, so I requested it from my library. But before I could get to it, my DVR recorded the episode of American Experience titled The Poison Squad, which is about this exact subject. So if you’re interested in the subject matter, but you aren’t really in the mood to read, I would highly recommend watching that documentary. It features Deborah Blum, the author, so it’s a great summary of the material she covered in this book.Harvey Washington Wiley was a man on a mission. At the time that he became the chief chemist of the US Department of Agriculture in 1883, food safety in America was non-existent. Cows were fed the swill from breweries, and the resulting milk they gave was watery and lacking much nutrition. They were chained upright in their stalls and forced to give milk until they fell over dead. Canned food started with rotting and decaying scraps brought back to life with dangerous additives. Flour was bleached with nitrogen oxides, leaving large doses of nitrates in the resulting product, which couldn’t be baked out. Not only were there no laws regulating what chemicals and preservatives could be added to the nation’s food supply, but there were no studies showing how safe or dangerous they were, and there was no requirement for labeling the products either. Containers could have higher bottoms than they appeared to have, making consumers believe they were getting more in a larger container when they really were getting less. And the consumer had no idea exactly what was in the food they were buying, whether they felt it was safe or not; they couldn’t decide for themselves whether to ingest saccharine or copper sulfate or the nitrates resulting from bleaching flour because there was no regulation on any of it. Wiley wanted to change all of that. Initially he sought simply to label food products so the consumer would be informed regarding what s/he was ingesting, but once he started his Poison Squad, in which he fed a team of twelve young men a specific diet over time to test various additives, he realized that the US needed laws against these harmful chemicals. But as in modern times, various lobbies sought to have his research buried so they could continue to make money with impunity. It was mind-boggling, coming off the impeachment hearings in which the Republicans kept making various excuses as to why the hearings weren’t even legitimate, to read about congressmen against any kind of food labeling, with such inane statements of, “The American consumer doesn’t need the government telling him what to eat!” when Dr. Wiley was simply trying to request laws that caused the government to tell the consumer what was in his food so he could decide what he wanted to ingest. It just sounded all so familiar.It also makes me shake my head to know that there are so many people in 21st century America that don’t realize how literally dangerous our food was just over a hundred years ago. In the age of wondering about pesticides and organic farming and “all-natural” foods and folks looking for “raw milk” (ie, un-pasteurized, which I cannot even fathom wanting after reading this book), at least we don’t have formaldehyde mixed into our milk, the sweet taste of which covered up the fact that it was spoiling quickly without pasteurization or refrigeration. And it was this addition of formaldehyde, an embalming fluid and a poison, which killed children that drank the milk.This book is interesting, but it does get bogged down in a lot of names and data. I would actually recommend watching the documentary over reading this book because it’s just so much information that it’s hard to keep a hold of. That said, if reading is more your speed, I highly recommend this book. "
11,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3726509-lis-carey,5,"This is the fascinating, alarming, and encouraging story of the first great round in the fight for food safety in the USA.In the second half of the 19th century, the food industry embraced the chemical industry, and preservatives, colorants, and substitutions became common. This might not sound all that alarming, as all those terms apply to things legitimately used in food now. However, at that time, milk could contain formaldehyde, jellies and jams might contain none of the claimed fruit at all and get their color from coal tar dyes, and there were no labeling requirements at all. Basic food safety legislation was making progress in Europe, but was completely squelched by industry efforts in America.In 1883, Dr. Harvey Washington Wiley was appointed chief chemist of the Department of Agriculture, and began a thirty-year crusade for clean, safe, and honestly packaged food. Under him, the agency began methodically investigating fraud in the manufacture and sale of food and drink. This included tests on human volunteers dubbed ""The Poison Squad,"" tests that probably wouldn't pass an ethics committee review now, but were for the time a serious early attempt at controlled testing with informed volunteer test subjects. Among the commonly used preservatives in food at the time, aside from formaldehyde, were borax (a cleaning compound) and salicylic acid (a pharmaceutical). Saccharine was used as a sugar substitute in food products that continued to be labeled, if they were at all, as being sweetened with sugar. Even honest labeling was seen as an outrageous infringement on noble American business.Wiley wasn't just fighting industry greed; he was often fighting politicians in the House and Senate, and even his own colleagues in the Department of Agriculture. On the other hand, he also had allies: the American Medical Association, women's suffrage groups, Fannie Farmer and other popular cookbook writers, women's magazines, and even those companies in the food industry, such as J.B. Heinz, who took pride in their products being manufactured to high standards with only the expected ingredients (ketchup made primarily of tomatoes, for instance.)It's a fascinating battle, with victories and setbacks, and Wiley himself is an interesting character. Nor is he the only interesting character here. It was never a one-man battle, on either side of the fight, and Blum truly does justice to the story.Highly recommended.I bought this audiobook."
12,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3357765-jimmy,5,"The author gives many examples of deceptive food practices in the 1800s and the turn of the century. Here is one: Honey was often tinted corn syrup. Without laws and regulations, how would we stop such unscrupulous practices? A few years ago I heard a friend complain about laws in California that required honey makers to register with the state for quality control. They forget that there are reasons for regulations. The book is a tribute to the great Dr. Harvey Washington Wiley who in 1883 as a young chemist first wrote a paper exposing such practices. And guess who opposed him? The honey producers themselves. They thought it would do harm to their reputations. So the trade journals attacked him. All the while ignoring the fact that many ""beekeepers"" had NO BEES. A report on milk production in 1850 reads like a horror story. The cows lived in misery, and the children drinking the milk were sick and often dying. Wiley became famous as a chemist doing his best to expose such practices. He was hated by some as a man ""who is doing all he can to destroy American business. Lead solder was used to seal the seams of tin cans. Europe regulated the use of lead, but the US had no standards even for food. This libertarian philosophy continues even to today. We have many who want the companies to regulate themselves. A dose of history might get them to think again about such a philosophy. Medicines were often little more than flavored drinking alcohol. Legislation was constantly flouted. Businesses opposed even the idea of a pure food and drug act. Wiley found support from women's organizations. One area of concern was a famously stimulating soft drink known as Coca-Cola. They wanted the company to drastically reduce the amount of cocaine in its formula. It also contained caffeine. That is still a problem. https://teens.drugabuse.gov/blog/post... Upton Sinclair, another hero, had a grubstake of $1,000 (about $30,000 today) to work on a novel about the courageous workers of the Chicago stockyards who were fighting for better living conditions. He would spend 7 weeks in the stockyards dressing in the grubby clothes of a worker to blend in. He would settle down to write the most influential book of his prolific career: The Jungle. It was about a Lithuanian immigrant with the dream of a better life in America. But he is nearly destroyed by the horrendous working conditions of the fictional ""Anderson"" meat-processing company. That name stood for Armour Meats. The conclusion of the book is that the only way out is to embrace socialism.Sinclair wanted to focus on workers' rights, but it was the meat stories that affected the reading public. Once again, it showed that there is always a connection between social justice and good environmental protection. From Upton Sinclair's book The Jungle, we learn such things as how pickled beef had to be bathed in acid; the men working that line had their fingers eaten away by repeated exposure. Tuberculosis germs thrived in the moist, stinking air of the processing plants and spread from animal to animal. Workers occasionally fell into vats of acid and ""when they were fished out, there was never enough left of them to be worth exhibiting."" Sometimes a worker would slip into a vat and be ""overlooked for days till all but the bones of them had gone out into the world as Anderson's Pure Beef Lard."" Everyone knew he meant Armour's. Poisoned bread was put out to control the rat population. ""Then the rats, bread, and meat would go into the hoppers together."" One hero in the publishing industry was Isaac Marcosson, who pushed to have Sinclair's book published by Doubleday, Page, & Company. Sinclair was discouraged, even though his book sold well and made a great impact. He said, ""I aimed for the public's heart, and by accident I hit it in the stomach."" All anyone cared about was their food and not the workers who suffered miserably. The whiskey makers did not want to have labels to show the dyes, additives, and synthetic alcohol in their products. They warned it would hurt taxes. Manufacturers in almost every industry joined together to fight any sign of food, drink, or drug regulation. Some things never change. Passing the Food and Drug Act in 1906 did not end the troubles. Wiley would be attacked constantly for the rest of his life. Manufacturers would spend all their time and money trying to gut the law. Just like they do today with our Consumer Protection Agency, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Endangered Species Act, and every regulation on the book designed to protect us all. One other tactic still used today was to limit funding of these laws. Then there are not enough inspectors. Cheating continues. The exception often proves the rule. There was one man and one company that tried to do it right: Heinz. They advertised a ketchup free from additives. It costs a few cents more, but they convinced consumers it was worth it. His company fought for pure food and decent working conditions. The fact that he was the only one shows how bad things were. Cocaine was famously used in Coca-Cola. Also many ""soothing syrups"" for children were laced with morphine, heroin, and chloral hydrate. Same for cough syrups and asthma medications. I salute the heroic life of Dr. Wiley. He believed in the power of science to benefit society. He said, ""The freedom of science should be kept inviolate."" In today's world we could use that type of idealism again. The President of the United States of America fights science all the time, and his party and others enable him. The so-called libertarian/conservative movement supports them. There is nothing conservative about such people. Nothing. We need to carry on Dr. Wiley's fight and never give up. "

There is an enormous amount of information in this book, but the title is on point. This was absolutely the story of one man's single-minded crusade to achieve a better world for mankind. It is unfortunate that H W Wiley was not able to see his ideals working the way he envisioned them working during his lifetime. It is unfortunate that a better balance cannot be reached between regulation and letting business run wild. It is unfortunate that to this day, we are still a reactionary society...big business fights against regulation...the public keeps their heads buried in the sand...but then disaster strikes and everyone scrambles to right the wrong and fight future injustices. I feel that this was worth reading. A bit repetitive at times, but an accurate depiction of everything it takes to create and enforce a regulation that works."

19,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6970638-sheri,3,"So I have come across this book several times as a good historical account of the development of the FDA. While current politics are highlighting the exact problems with big business and government officials (Trump defunding the EPA and deregulating pork manufacturers are two easy examples), this book feels sadly timely. Polices are always (it seems) a balance between protecting the lower classes and negotiating with big business: ""The story of consumer protection in the United States is often the story of a country playing defense, an account of government regulators waking up, time and again, to yet another public health crisis"".That said, the was an super easy read and gives a good historical account of the process by which Americans began to understand that adulterated food was not a good thing. I found it not compelling at times, but I have also been very busy and distracted this week with other things. I probably would have enjoyed it more at a different time.Overall it is an important and approachable book, but in this moment of COVID coupled with racial protests over our incompetent criminal justice system it felt like just another example of American individualist culture putting capitalist pursuits over equality for all."

Should be required reading for the naive libertarians who have forgotten what an unrestricted market will devolve into and the lengths it will go to protect itself. They still test food for floor sweepings to this day and we have the tireless efforts of the folks in this book to thank for that. I learned a lot from this book, including that Upton Sinclair's The Jungle was actually a socialist book and Sinclair was disappointed the public reaction was more about the meat rather than the workers. Docked one star since it felt a little repetitive due to structuring the story around Wiley's life, which was relatively boring, but definitely recommended.

Parallels to a lot of the same fights being waged against the food industry today (eg: added sugars, trans fat, labeling, “generally recognized as safe,” etc.) Would have liked a more generalized history of this effort rather than this rather narrow, semi biographical focus on one personality, albeit a key one.

This is both truly well written and a reminder how history repeats. if you hear about how good the food used to be, this book reminds you how good the food really was not. The Poison Squad: One Chemist's Single-Minded Crusade for Food Safety at the Turn of the Twentieth Century is history at its best. Told with a reporter's eye, but with humanity, Deborah Blum never lets the reader forget what is at stake. She spins a tale that reads like a well written novel, but never strays from the main pint of the book. This is the story of America's food purity law and the battle that started at the turn of the twentieth century and continues to this day.What comes across very well is this is the type of battle that is waged throughout American history. I was amazed at the companies that are under fire today were under fire then too. I am also amazed how certain brands were always industry leaders in both quality and purity. The same arguments portrayed the are used today. It is too expensive, it will not hurt the public, the government has no oversight to name just a few.The Poison Squad: One Chemist's Single-Minded Crusade for Food Safety at the Turn of the Twentieth Century is also about iconoclastic personalities. Dr. Wiley, the main focus of the book is so single minded, he cannot comprehend compromise.This is both an excellent history and an excellent read."
25,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1392376-erin,5,"Listened to audiobook. I may be more interested in this book than your average American because I do work with agriculture regulations, but I loved this snapshot of the Dr. Wiley and the eventual creation of the FDA. It is both comforting and frustrating to see that the more things change, the more they stay the same. I believe there will always be an inherent friction between the public's and the government's tolerance for risk. With anything, there is no way to promise that risk and harm can be completely eliminated from any system, and this includes the American food supply. However, by funding research and using science to make thoughtful and effective regulations (i.e. with enforcement fully funded), we can mitigate great amounts of risk and make the food supply safe for the public.It is also interesting to see how ""owning"" your work in the government can really blind a person to the ever changing circumstances and inevitably hamstring their own work and mission. I'd like to shake some of my colleagues sometimes and say, ""You don't own this. This is not YOUR program. It is the program you manage for the taxpayers"". As soon as you add your own ego to your work, you can no longer be the objective manager/worker you were hired to be. If you want ego, go into private industry. If you are in public service, check your ego at the door. Dr. Wiley lost that objectivity later in his career and life and it made him less effective in his job."
26,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/81873043-e,4,"Clearly well-researched, it's a look into the life of Dr. Harvey Wiley and also the precursor department to what we know as the FDA today. It's both fascinating and horrifying, the list of preservatives and agents that industry manufacturers considered common to put in their food for the masses. No one will be surprised that half of one chapter is devoted to Upton Sinclair and ""The Jungle"" but how many people know that the federal government put Coca-Cola on trial? I'd recommend this book to anyone who enjoys history, chemistry or food."
27,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9310118-jeimy,4,"This is billed as a fascinating story about how food was made safe in America, but I have to disagree with the second part of that statement. It is about how food was made safer. However, it doesn't take much for readers to see how much our capitalistic government bends to serve the whims of corporations. Food adulterations continue to occur. Read this book to understand how much has improved and ponder how far we still have to go."
28,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15251834-camille-mccarthy,4," I enjoyed this book and thought the writing was pretty engaging. I thought the author could have done a better job connecting the food additives issues to today than the short epilogue at the end, but I thought she described Wiley's influence on the food safety issue very well. The book focused narrowly on issues of food safety and on Wiley's life, which made it a little hard to put this history into context with what else was going on at the time, politically. There was some mention of suffragettes, but only because Wiley's wife was famous for being one. I thought having more context might make the book more interesting for those who aren't so interested in hearing lists of chemicals that were in various foods - since I minored in Chemistry this was fascinating to me and I never got tired of it. I enjoyed the connection to ""the Jungle"" by Upton Sinclair, and I was glad the author included that part of the story, but I thought she sadly didn't connect Sinclair's socialist politics with the politics at the time. The way he is presented, he sounds like a lonely socialist man with outlandish ideas, but actually there was a strong socialist tendency in the US at the time, and the book ""Young Radicals in the War for American Ideals"" goes into some of this, though I think it, too, is overly simplistic.  If you enjoy this topic, a book that is extremely well-written, relevant to today, and incredibly necessary reading is ""A Terrible Thing to Waste"" by Harriet A. Washington, which focuses on environmental racism and how pollutants and poisons disproportionately affect Black and brown Americans and cause negative cognitive effects - it was one of the best nonfiction books I've ever read and I can't say enough about it.  This book goes into a lot of the nitty-gritty of how even in the turn of the 20th century, industry lobbyists had their crooked fingers in every aspect of government regulation, and even government scientists faced a lot of pressure to just tow the industry line and let everyone get poisoned for profits. I think the author is a little harsh on Wiley for saying he was too pedantic at times and didn't pick his battles - I think if you are a scientist charged with keeping a country safe, and you know that the safety of a nation hinges on your regulations, you have to be pedantic, and even so, he was only saying chemicals shouldn't be included in food items after he had provided substantial proof that they were causing harm. To me, there is no middle ground in choosing people's lives and safety over profit, and I'm glad he saw it that way as well. These days we have Monsanto lackeys in that kind of position, and even so we still have publications that are suppressed and scientists that are blacklisted for reporting their findings regarding the safety of some of these products, notably GMOs.  I found this book fascinating, not just from a historical perspective but for the sheer horrors of capitalism that are on display - this is another thing the book didn't really analyze, but rather takes for granted as a price of doing business, but should be emphasized - these people were using obvious poisons to make their food products more enticing, were killing people and doing physical damage with their poisonous adulterants, and then weren't even punished or taken to task because there was no law against putting poisons in food. How gross is that? "
29,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50448-becky,5,"First sentence from introduction: We tend these days to cast a romantic glow over the foods of our forefathers. In such rosy light, we may imagine grandparents or great-grandparents thriving happily--and solely--on farm-fresh produce and pasture-raised livestock. We may even believe they ate and drank in a world untouched by the chemically enhanced and deceptive food manufacturing practices of today. In this we would be wrong.First sentence from chapter one: The sixth of seven children, Harvey Washington Wiley was born on April 16, 1844, in a log cabin on a small farm in Kent, Indiana, about a hundred miles northeast of the farm where Abraham Lincoln had grown up a few decades earlier. Premise/plot: The Poison Squad is a page-turner. It is the story of Harvey Washington Wiley and the FIGHT for food safety. Wiley wanted LAWS, REGULATIONS, OVERSIGHT. At the very least, he wanted FOOD LABELS that clearly and accurately listed WHAT was in the food (and drinks) being manufactured. Shouldn't milk be milk, sugar be sugar, pepper be pepper, and flour be flour? You'd think so--but that wasn't often the case. Manufacturers were ADDING things to their products--legally since there wasn't a law against--and people--sometimes children--were dying.Though the story mainly focuses on the early twentieth century--up through the first world war--the story begins in the nineteenth century. It isn't Wiley's story alone for he wasn't alone in his fight. There were good guys and bad guys. The manufacturers often were buddy-buddy with politicians. Politicians cared more about staying that way--protecting the interests of businesses and manufacturers--than about public safety. You'd almost think that politicians didn't have families of their own. Then again, this is also a story of class. It was mainly the poor whose food supply was effected. The ultra-rich could always buy fresh food--fresh meat, fresh vegetables, fresh fruit, fresh dairy products. Wiley's argument was that we should CARE what is in our food and care about HOW our food is being handled and processed.My thoughts: Fascinating. Compelling. Scary. Those words are how I'd sum up this biographical must-read. This is an incredible read. It has almost robbed me of any desire I had to TIME TRAVEL. If I ever do time travel, I think I'll bring my own food with me. It was SUPER-SCARY to read accounts about how UNSAFE food was. For example, today we may think that candy is ""unhealthy"" because of SUGAR but THEN candy was unhealthy because it actually-actually contained POISON. And that's just one example.I'd be surprised if anyone could read this one without starting to share facts or factoids with others. DID YOU KNOW? DID YOU KNOW? DID YOU KNOW? It's just a super-absorbing read that gives much food for thought.Food labels are something that most people take for granted. I know I did for most of my life. All that changed for me--a few years ago. I developed allergies to certain foods as an adult. I now read food labels super-closely. Knowing exactly what is in something is crucial. Wiley is a super-hero; his name should be better known and his work celebrated. "
30,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72623806-nicholle,5,"I give this book 5 stars (out of 5). I loved the science/chemistry and history behind the story. The author is an excellent science writer and wrote such an intriguing story. The parts where she described the politics behind the story were boring to me (I cannot stand politics), but a necessary evil in order to describe how the story played out. This story is about chemist Dr. Harvey Washington Wiley and how he wanted to make sure that all food was safe, or at least labeled, from adulterants. Such adulterants were arsenic, dyes from coal tar, and boric acid (or borax), just to name a few. He was truly a man ahead of his time because during a time where most individuals (and even companies) were ignorant of science and most companies producing food only cared about making a profit, he strove to make sure food was safe from unnecessary additives (or adulterants) by actually testing the additives to prove that they were in fact harmful to people.Dr. Wiley set up experiments to feed a group of individuals adulterants, such as boric acid, by comparing that group against a control group not being fed adulterants. The data he and his team of chemists generated was not only rigorous and scientific, but also proved his hypothesis that the adulterants being added to food were in fact harmful to people. Taking this data a step further, he extrapolated that if these adulterants were harmful to healthy (male) adults, these adulterants were even more harmful to babies, children, and the elderly. Dr. Wiley fought almost his whole career against the politics of the unscrupulous lobby behind the companies making the adulterated foods. What I found so fascinating was that among the few companies that did mass produce food without adulterants was the company that made Heinz ketchup. The owner behind the ketchup not only wanted to make food without adulterants, but he also wanted to prove that making unadulterated food could be profitable, since that was the main argument behind the companies that adulterated food was that they could not be profitable. What I truly loved about Dr. Wiley was his desire to speak up about the chemistry behind the adulterants, without dumbing it down, to women. He wrote countless articles in magazines and publications geared towards women. He knew that getting women (who make up 50% of the population) on board with his cause would only further his fight in the political arena to achieve his goals. Dr. Wiley even married a suffragist and supported her desire to be jailed for her fight for women to vote.Another aspect I found so fascinating about this book is the role the government needs to play to protect the average American, or consumer, from unregulated business that cares more about profit than the health of the consumer by taking shortcuts. While I read this book the government shut down was occurring. And it also seems the trend in the current administration is to cozy up to big business that may or may not care about the average American consumer in their bottom line. Only time will tell if this is occurring, and unfortunately as history does repeat itself, who (and how many) will have to get sick and or die before government steps in to protect the average American consumer? "
31,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56837139-brandon-polzin,3,"This book was an enjoyable narrative about a story that I never thought I would be interested in. The topic of food safety is a vitally important one, and I am grateful that a person like Harvey Washington Wiley had a lifelong goal of supporting food transparency for the benefit of the United States' citizens. I am a sucker for the time period in American History that a large portion of this book is set in, as Theodore Roosevelt is one of my favorite historical figures. He is painted as a protagonist in most of the other books that I've read, so it was amusing to see him portrayed in an antagonistic light here.All that being said, I felt this book had a few shortcomings. I may be spoiled after reading biographical narratives by Siddharta Mukherjee and Edmund Morris, but I felt illustrative descriptions of characters and settings were lacking in this book. I certainly was never bored, but it lacked the fiction-like and seemingly whimsical appeal of other critically acclaimed nonfiction narratives. It may be, though, that the nature of this story was not as exciting as those I am comparing it to, so I don't want to place the blame solely on Blum's shoulders.Another issue I had was the intermittent lack of focus/mislabeling of the book. The subtitle of the book (""One Chemist's...) implies that it is a biography about one man, that man being the aforementioned Wiley. Blum went into great detail about him, but would then move on to other parallel stories that coincided with the progression of food safety within the United States. This was obviously all relevant to the overarching story the book was trying to tell, but because of the excessive breaks from Wiley I felt this book should have been explicitly marketed as a story of food safety as a whole, not JUST as a narrative about Wiley. It's a nitpicky criticism, but I found myself being taken out of the story and thinking about it as I read the book.All in all though, I would recommend this book. I love that there was a ""cast of characters"" in the beginning to reference to whenever I forgot about a person's name or their significance. I also loved they way Blum used the story of food safety in the USA to emphasize the control that big business has over the way consumers act and think as a whole, and the importance of a dissenting opinion when everyone is all too eager to comply.I would rate this book a 3.5 if I could, but I'll round up because I'm feeling nice. I hope you can get your hands on a copy sometime soon!"
32,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1468458-lisa,4,"So why do they bleach flour? Read this and you will find out and probably never buy bleached flour again. Having worked in QA in the pharmaceutical industry, I was familiar with the Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906 as the beginning of the regulation of pharmaceuticals, but hadn't really known that its major impetus was on food and I had never heard of the man who had such a big part of making it law, Dr. Harvey Washington Wiley. It was not just unclean production practices that put the food supply at risk of contamination. The dangers included what was purposefully added like heavy metal and coal tar food dyes, especially in candy; formaldehyde in meat and milk; preservatives that had never been tested for safety of human consumption; sugar replacements that had no caloric value; and other fillers added just to improve the profit margin. Some of these additives were even marketed to grocers and food producers solely based on their ability to be undetected and increase profitability by dilution of the actual food product or by masking spoilage. People were literally being killed by the food they ate. The book details just how adulterated our food supply was prior to this act, how much industry worked to keep it that way, how much politicians were unconcerned about the health and welfare of the common person, and how hard Dr. Wiley had to work to protect consumers. Some things never really change and the parallels to our modern world are easy to see. Industry does not, never has, and never will self-regulate if it means less profitability. There were some good guy manufacturers who were promoting pure food, such as H.J. Heinz Company, but they were the rare exception. Some of these same companies that were willingly putting our health at risk over 100 years ago are still in business: Armour, Swift, Coca-cola, Monsanto, McCormick. Despite the debt we owe him and his Poison Squad volunteers, they and Dr. Wiley have mostly been forgotten today. This book attempts to correct that. I fully appreciated the inclusion of historic photos, political cartoons, and food ads. It was especially gratifying to see the woman working in the chemistry lab in the early 1900's. Deborah Blum also includes Dr. Wiley's wife, Anna Kelton Wiley, who was one of the suffragists jailed by President Wilson. Are these hints at a future book on the womens' suffrage movement? I could completely see how this book could be born out of the research from ""The Poisoner's Handbook"" due to the pure whiskey issue. "
33,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71163840-steven-meyers,5,"If you are under the impression that food was awesome back in the “good ole days,” then, man oh man, Ms. Blum’s book will relieve you of that misconception. ‘The Poison Squad’ shows how business greed and political chicanery worked hand-in-hand to place private interests over consumer safety. As the author states, “Fraud was not just pervasive, it was standard practice.” The decades-long fight over supplying consumers with information about what is in their food and the toxic dangers in it was enlightening but discouraging to read. Ms. Blum is a highly respected author who has written numerous books in the field of science. Her writing style is direct and easy to understand. The years covered are from 1844 through 1938. Buckle up, you’re in for a illuminating scary ride. During the mid-1800s, manufacturers and food processors discovered certain inexpensive chemicals could imitate foods and hide unhealthy diseased meats or other perishable products. Factory environments were hellholes, riddled with unsafe and unclean practices. Into this business atmosphere came Harvey Washington Wiley, a government chemist, who began experiments on the quality of foods, exposed business deceptions, and made the public aware of what their families were eating and drinking. Needless to say, company feces hit the fan big time. While Ms. Blum does center the book on Mr. Wiley’s actions, a plethora of other food safety advocates and detractors are also explained. During his three decades crusading against business chicanery he became a very popular and widely loved individual by the general public. Politicians and businessmen, however, would have liked nothing better than for Mr. Wiley to wind up in a can of corned beef or be fired. I never heard of the guy until I picked up ‘The Poison Squad.’ ‘The Poison Squad’ shows that there were responsible high-minded corporations such as Heinz who practiced and advocated for safe foods and there were plenty of nasty ones such as Monsanto who aggressively fought to allow their “additives” to remain in the market. The way companies acted about possibly having to supply consumers with ingredient information so they could make more informed choices, you’d think it was the next thing to Armageddon. It would be naïve to believe that those awful days are completely gone and corporations now place consumer safety over greed. Sure, like yesteryear, there are businesses that are good corporate stewards but like the old Russian proverb we should, “Trust but verify” before embracing a business’s assertions, especially when it comes to consumer safety. Greed has not somehow magically disappeared. In the author’s epilogue she states, “The story of consumer protection in the United States is often to story of a country playing defense, an account of government regulators waking up, time and time again, to yet another public health crisis.” In other words, once a sizable number of consumers bite the dust and it gets enough press exposure, then politicians and government act. Compared to the time period covered in the book, food safety has greatly improved. However, many businesses still focus on profit over public welfare is still very much with us. Ms. Blum has, yet again, written another highly informative work. Read it and weep."
34,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2125854-becca-younk,3,"I loved The Poisoner's Handbook, so of course I had to read this when I spied it on display at the library. It's not quite as good, but still a compelling and interesting read. It's a bit scary to think about all the ingredients listed on labels that I wouldn't even be able to guess what they are, but at least they're listed! I can google them if I'm so inclined. Whereas previously, food manufacturers could just throw in basically whatever they wanted. The book follows Dr. Wiley at the Agriculture Department as he conducts studies in an effort to pass a Pure Food law. Dr. Wiley sounds great, he ends up marrying a suffragette, which is cool. I think where this book sort of falls flat is all the emphasis on the trials and the inner workings of the Department and politicians. It's interesting for awhile, and then gets a bit tedious and feels a little too much like office drama. While The Poisoner's Handbook gives specific examples of how poisons killed people, this book tends to just list deaths or illnesses as numbers. ""100 children died from such-and-such in Indiana"" type of thing, without going into detail. Food safety isn't as shocking as poisons, sure, but I wish there were more human impact stories. ""Cure-all"" medications are briefly mentioned, and it makes me wonder if Blum will write an entire book on those. Crossing my fingers she does, because that would be fascinating. Twice in the book Blum writes Midland, Michigan, as Midlands, Michigan. Once I can believe is a typo. But twice? It takes two seconds of googling to find that the headquarters of Dow is in Midland, no 's.' I find I'm very annoyed by the lack of caring to get a city name correct. Is publishing in such a bad state that there are no editors?"

She has an incredible talent for writing history and, in particular, making the areas of scientific history unbelievably exciting!After thoroughly enjoying her other book, The Poisoner’s Handbook, several years back, I was eager to pick up another one by her. The Poison Squad explores the unique history of food safety laws in the U.S. and the influence of historical figures on the creation of the Food Safety and Drug Administration — specifically Upton Sinclair’s The Jungle and Harvey Washington Wiley, the famous 19th century chemist who identified poisons in everyday manufactured foods we love to eat. The author also provides intriguing cases of food poisoning scandals by manufactured foods throughout the 19th and early 20th century. For example, in June 1899, the city of Cincinnati had to warn its citizens of an epidemic of stomach problems following the consumption of “embalmed” beef. “More than one thousand people had fallen ill in a single week after eating beef.” The culprit? Two new brand-name preservatives at the time that contained formaldehyde as a main ingredient. (p. 61) Truly a fascinating history! So glad we live in the times that we do! Highly recommended read. :-)"

It took me several weeks to get through this book but, I still really enjoyed it. This book basically covers the story of Wiley and his fight for food safety regulations. It also discusses the effect politics can have on regulations and consumer protection as well as the creation of the 1906 Pure Food and Drug Act. It is quite alarming to me how we allow politics to impede the creation of regulations to keep people safe. This book provides examples of times when scientists and researchers were providing data about an adulterant saying, ""this can hurt you"" and industry saying, "" no it's fine"" and then politicians agreeing with industry. While we don't want to hurt business and our economy it is important to keep in mind that generally companies in industry are looking out for their own interest. Also I am so grateful for the safety regulations we have now. We don't have to worry about formalin in milk etc. One of my favorite quotes from this book was from Wiley in regards to the purpose of science which is "" to search for truth and thereby to elevate and improve mankind"". "
37,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63521529-beth-menendez,5,"Solid 4.5 stars. I'm dinging it half a star because it is a scince-y book that can get a little dry at times and I think it may lose some readers because of this. However, for anyone who think that the Whole Foods movement and Clean Eating is a new fad, you are gravely mistaken. Deborah Blum does a fantastic job of making Dr. Harvey Washington Wiley come to life. Dr. Washington was the Chief Chemist in the Department of Chemistry and fought for YEARS trying to get congress to approve bills for the Pure Food and Drug movement. Before this movement it was completely legal to add preservatives to food so that spoiled food could then be served to the masses. Yes. Spoiled food. Since mass refrigeration was not really a thing yet, nor was any kind of safety guidelines for chemicals (whether used in food or drugs) all kinds of sketchy things were going on with food for the masses. Milk a little off? No worries, we'll put formaldehyde in it. Oh, was that cow a bit sick? No worries, we'll use some potassium nitrate (saltpeter) to keep it okay. It does not mater that saltpeter will actually kill you. It's cheaper than sodium chloride (table salt) so it's fine. Seriously. The stuff they put in medicines... eek. Just eek. So how does Dr Wiley come in? He began to protest that what manufacturers put in things was deceiving the populations. That maple syrup is not syrup. It's coal tar derived color agents (seriously) and water with a little sugar. Later with a lot of saccharin in it. Because it's cheaper. There were huge arguments over corn syrup as a cheaper additive to foods than sugar. Wait - aren't we STILL arguing about this. Yes, yes we are. After reading this book I am realizing how much has stayed the same and not changed a bit. Oh the topics might be a little different but the court case involving Coca Cola and their ingredients that were both addicting to people and toxic to them that went round and round could be replaced with the energy drinks of today all over the same chemical - caffeine.  The way that what we eat is literally influenced by who is in the White House was a bit of a shock. Dr. Wiley had harder times certain years simply because the president in office elected secretaries that made Dr. Wiley's job almost impossible. The fact that the main secretary to the USDA over him had ties to manufacturing making his job nearly impossible at the end of his term could have read like it was happening today. Upton Sinclair's book The Jungle was more than just a novel - it was a whistle blowing land mine that showed many what was going on with the ""food"" we eat. Even with that book selling thousands of copies there was much attempt to discredit Sinclair which were eventually successful because Sinclair was a socialist - he just wanted everyone to get a fair (clean healthy) shake. Manufacturers and lobbyists were not about to let this happen and so he became a pariah in Washington.  The one thing that resounded throughout the book is how much we fight over the minutiae until there is a national epidemic sadly has not changed. The 1906 original Pure Foods bill (Dr Wiley's bill) came into effect after many children died from the formaldehyde in the milk after YEARS of dying on the floor of Congress. The 1938 bill that beefed (no pun intended) up the bill came about after many children died from taking cough syrup that had been made with sweetened with diethylene glycol (antifreeze). Similar bills were passed in 1956 and 1971 after injury to women and children. Why do I mention this? Because we are STILL fighting this battle - remember when there was salmonella in the peanut butter? Remember how no one could eat salad last Thanksgiving because of E.Coli? Yes, we are still fighting getting clean, pure food from manufacturers. If that is not scary I cannot think what is. Before we look at the past with rose colored glasses we need to realize that the fight for balance of what is actually good for us and what can be had cheaply is still going on. For this reason alone, I highly recommend this book. "
38,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63970501-maureen-caupp,4,"A very interesting read about the work done at the turn of the twentieth century by the United States Department of Agriculture to determine the contents of food and drinks, the impacts of the added compounds on health, and the continuing battle to regulate harmful additives and require truthful labeling. At the turn of the century food manufactures used dangerous preservatives such as formaldehyde in dairy and meats to cover up already spoiling products. Manufactures also used cheap synthetic dyes and flavorings to cut costs. For example ketchup often didn't have tomatoes and strawberry jam didn't contain strawberries. Instead both were any available food scraps left over (pumpkin rinds, apple cores and skins, etc.) dyed red.This book focuses on the efforts of the chief chemist at the USDA for over 30 years around the turn of the century who worked tirelessly and was a strong advocate for regulation and accurate labeling. It also goes into some of the legal battles involved in regulating additives to food and drink. Just like today whenever any regulating legislation managed to get passed into law manufactures pushed back to weaken the new laws. "

IS A MANIFESTO.I follow the two blogs, Barf Blog and Food Safety News, at work, and when this book was published, both of them published blurbs on it, suggesting it was a good read. My coworker, now my manager, requested the library purchase it, and they did! So she borrowed it and said it was fascinating.Then when it came out in paperback, both blogs again ran blurbs, and I checked it out.I would consider this a must-read book. It details so much about common assumptions of the public, government, and business, and WHY government is absolutely essential to putting roadblocks into the path of capitalism.Some might say that the book bogs down a bit when it details all the different shit (sometimes literally) the Bureau of Chemistry was finding in food products, but it never repeated itself, and it honestly could have gone on forever. The borax, the salicylic acid, the lead, it just never stopped coming. The rise of industrial chemistry, while ultimately a good thing, makes me shiver in fear at what it would have been like to have been alive then.Absolutely loved the epilogue where the author warns against this presidential administration pointing out that it directly mirrors what Harvey Washington Wiley was up against.Those who are not students of history are condemned to repeat the past, indeed."

48,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32057224-grace,3,"I think this is an important read to understand the politics and process behind the eventual creation of the FDA. It is essential to understand that throughout time, industry/corporations in masse have actively fought against protecting individuals if they perceived the requested change would have a negative impact on their profit. These corporations have expended significant revenue to market the political idea of the deregulation of all the things. This book is a great example of why, as a society, there is a necessity for many of the existing regulations. It also does a good job of highlighting corporations and individuals who were open to change and saw the value in a pure food movement and how it could be economically and socially beneficial. Personally, I think I should have read this slower and just read a chapter here and there. To some extent, the chapters and build up were formulaic and came off as a tad dense. This is likely because the majority of the book discussed how a food or beverage was adulterated and the steps taken to stop the incorrect labeling or toxic additives. The adulterations were often similar and the process of fighting the deceptions would be similar, ie. education of the public and the attempt to pass laws to prohibit the additives or mislabeling. Due to the somewhat repetitive nature, I think I would have liked to spread out this book. With that said, I still enjoyed this read and recommend it! If I could I would have given it 3.5 and probably would have been a 4.0 had a read it like I suggested above."

54,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2404655-melissa,5,This was fascinating (and horrifying/disgusting) discussion of post industrial America and the food industry pre- regulations. 
55,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6293008-filippe,5,"“The Shutdown is Bad For Anyone Who Eats Food”, says Stephen Colbert on Friday, January 11. “Don't Panic: The Government Shutdown Isn't Making Food Unsafe”, counters NPR’s Dan Charles on Weekend Update the following morning.It’s 2019, but you’d be forgiven for thinking of pre-1906 America after reading this wonderful account of the U.S. “pure food movement” and its most steadfast defender and all-around gadfly, chemist Harvey W. Wiley, a man I’d heard nothing about before. As in all of her previous books, Blum’s conversational tone belies meticulous research and attention to detail. Each chapter, charmingly epigraphed with a line or verse from a poem by Wiley himself, is filled with quotations from primary sources; ancillary characters are given their due. Decades of political warfare and industry opposition to pure-food-and-drug laws (familiar names such as Monsanto, Dow Chemical, and Coca-Cola all make unflattering appearances) are richly described.The hand-wringing ineffectiveness of early enforcement, endless concessions to regulation-hating manufacturers, conflicts of interest, and downright corruption in the Department of Agriculture and elsewhere are frustrating, unsurprising, and terribly modern, but I sometimes found myself equally exasperated by Wiley’s crusader-style single-mindedness (that word’s in the title for a reason).I do wish the book had focused more on Wiley’s later-life work with Good Housekeeping Laboratories and covered a bit more of the history of the Food and Drug Administration (newly founded at the book’s close and Wiley’s death in 1930). I wish Wiley’s work and that of the pure-food defenders was not still under continuous undermining more than a century later, as the Epilogue notes. And, tangentially, I would love to read a similar biography/history of Frances Oldham Kelsey’s half-century of work at the FDA. What a lovely parallel (or sequel) that would make."

59,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76170804-judy-monchuk,4,"What a fascinating and frightening read. This history of the fight for food safety laws in the United States is a disturbing page-turner that literally kept me up at night because I didn’t want to put it down.As food manufacturers in the late 19th century embraced chemicals as preservatives, sweeteners or colourants to keep food bright and tasty, they were under no obligation to tell customers what was in their milk or meat, coffee or candy. Whiskey might not even be whiskey. Children died after drinking “chemically improved” milk, canned meat sent to soldiers fighting in the Spanish-American war was described as “embalmed beef.” Formaldehyde was used to deal with the sour taste of milk and extend its life, while chalk was added to whiten it. Borax improved the taste of rancid butter, candy was coloured with poisonous dyes that included arsenic or lead. Saccharine (marketed by Monsanto more than a century ago) presented a health risk if consumed in large enough doses, which was likely because it was an unlabelled sweetener in many products: from soft drinks to jam to canned vegetables. There was no requirement for any food to be or even include what it said it was. Spices could be predominantly anything but the pepper or ginger promised on the bottle, which may include burned shells, charcoal and even floor sweepings. Honey was often tinted corn syrup, tea leaves may not be tea and “fraud was not just pervasive; it was standard practice.”Any effort to introduce safety testing or require a breakdown of ingredients was met with sharp resistance from industry, which often received a sympathetic ear in the White House across a handful of administrations. At the dawn of the 20th century, the manufacturer of a formaldehyde-infused preservative called Freezine argued that the public should just embrace whatever chemicals prevented food decay without question, noting “I wish to say that every one of us eats embalmed meat and we know it and we like it.” Weaving all of this together is a biography of chemist Dr. Harvey Wiley, who refused to back down in his quest for consumer protection. Wiley, chief chemist for the US Department of Agriculture, spent decades fighting for regulations, investigation and even basic labelling to inform consumers what was their food or drinks. The Pure Food and Drug Act, passed in 1906, was known to many as “Dr. Wiley’s law” although he is largely a footnote in history today. In his later years, Wiley was bitter about the struggle and the constant pushback from industry for any regulation. Pulitzer Prize-winning science journalist Deborah Blum has done a fabulous job of bringing this era to life and outlining the challenges facing Wiley and others who tried to spotlight the importance of food safety. It’s rare to celebrate the efforts of a civil servant, especially where those who work for the public good are often painted by politicians as an impediment to business, a consideration spelled out in Wiley’s day. It’s also very true in the 21st century, where the current president vowed to eliminate any regulation that kills jobs. The Poison Squad: One Chemist's Single-Minded Crusade for Food Safety at the Turn of the Twentieth Century is a first-rate thriller. 4.5 stars."
60,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72623806-nicholle,5,"I give this book 5 stars (out of 5). I loved the science/chemistry and history behind the story. The author is an excellent science writer and wrote such an intriguing story. The parts where she described the politics behind the story were boring to me (I cannot stand politics), but a necessary evil in order to describe how the story played out. This story is about chemist Dr. Harvey Washington Wiley and how he wanted to make sure that all food was safe, or at least labeled, from adulterants. Such adulterants were arsenic, dyes from coal tar, and boric acid (or borax), just to name a few. He was truly a man ahead of his time because during a time where most individuals (and even companies) were ignorant of science and most companies producing food only cared about making a profit, he strove to make sure food was safe from unnecessary additives (or adulterants) by actually testing the additives to prove that they were in fact harmful to people.Dr. Wiley set up experiments to feed a group of individuals adulterants, such as boric acid, by comparing that group against a control group not being fed adulterants. The data he and his team of chemists generated was not only rigorous and scientific, but also proved his hypothesis that the adulterants being added to food were in fact harmful to people. Taking this data a step further, he extrapolated that if these adulterants were harmful to healthy (male) adults, these adulterants were even more harmful to babies, children, and the elderly. Dr. Wiley fought almost his whole career against the politics of the unscrupulous lobby behind the companies making the adulterated foods. What I found so fascinating was that among the few companies that did mass produce food without adulterants was the company that made Heinz ketchup. The owner behind the ketchup not only wanted to make food without adulterants, but he also wanted to prove that making unadulterated food could be profitable, since that was the main argument behind the companies that adulterated food was that they could not be profitable. What I truly loved about Dr. Wiley was his desire to speak up about the chemistry behind the adulterants, without dumbing it down, to women. He wrote countless articles in magazines and publications geared towards women. He knew that getting women (who make up 50% of the population) on board with his cause would only further his fight in the political arena to achieve his goals. Dr. Wiley even married a suffragist and supported her desire to be jailed for her fight for women to vote.Another aspect I found so fascinating about this book is the role the government needs to play to protect the average American, or consumer, from unregulated business that cares more about profit than the health of the consumer by taking shortcuts. While I read this book the government shut down was occurring. And it also seems the trend in the current administration is to cozy up to big business that may or may not care about the average American consumer in their bottom line. Only time will tell if this is occurring, and unfortunately as history does repeat itself, who (and how many) will have to get sick and or die before government steps in to protect the average American consumer? "
61,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56837139-brandon-polzin,3,"This book was an enjoyable narrative about a story that I never thought I would be interested in. The topic of food safety is a vitally important one, and I am grateful that a person like Harvey Washington Wiley had a lifelong goal of supporting food transparency for the benefit of the United States' citizens. I am a sucker for the time period in American History that a large portion of this book is set in, as Theodore Roosevelt is one of my favorite historical figures. He is painted as a protagonist in most of the other books that I've read, so it was amusing to see him portrayed in an antagonistic light here.All that being said, I felt this book had a few shortcomings. I may be spoiled after reading biographical narratives by Siddharta Mukherjee and Edmund Morris, but I felt illustrative descriptions of characters and settings were lacking in this book. I certainly was never bored, but it lacked the fiction-like and seemingly whimsical appeal of other critically acclaimed nonfiction narratives. It may be, though, that the nature of this story was not as exciting as those I am comparing it to, so I don't want to place the blame solely on Blum's shoulders.Another issue I had was the intermittent lack of focus/mislabeling of the book. The subtitle of the book (""One Chemist's...) implies that it is a biography about one man, that man being the aforementioned Wiley. Blum went into great detail about him, but would then move on to other parallel stories that coincided with the progression of food safety within the United States. This was obviously all relevant to the overarching story the book was trying to tell, but because of the excessive breaks from Wiley I felt this book should have been explicitly marketed as a story of food safety as a whole, not JUST as a narrative about Wiley. It's a nitpicky criticism, but I found myself being taken out of the story and thinking about it as I read the book.All in all though, I would recommend this book. I love that there was a ""cast of characters"" in the beginning to reference to whenever I forgot about a person's name or their significance. I also loved they way Blum used the story of food safety in the USA to emphasize the control that big business has over the way consumers act and think as a whole, and the importance of a dissenting opinion when everyone is all too eager to comply.I would rate this book a 3.5 if I could, but I'll round up because I'm feeling nice. I hope you can get your hands on a copy sometime soon!"
62,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1468458-lisa,4,"So why do they bleach flour? Read this and you will find out and probably never buy bleached flour again. Having worked in QA in the pharmaceutical industry, I was familiar with the Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906 as the beginning of the regulation of pharmaceuticals, but hadn't really known that its major impetus was on food and I had never heard of the man who had such a big part of making it law, Dr. Harvey Washington Wiley. It was not just unclean production practices that put the food supply at risk of contamination. The dangers included what was purposefully added like heavy metal and coal tar food dyes, especially in candy; formaldehyde in meat and milk; preservatives that had never been tested for safety of human consumption; sugar replacements that had no caloric value; and other fillers added just to improve the profit margin. Some of these additives were even marketed to grocers and food producers solely based on their ability to be undetected and increase profitability by dilution of the actual food product or by masking spoilage. People were literally being killed by the food they ate. The book details just how adulterated our food supply was prior to this act, how much industry worked to keep it that way, how much politicians were unconcerned about the health and welfare of the common person, and how hard Dr. Wiley had to work to protect consumers. Some things never really change and the parallels to our modern world are easy to see. Industry does not, never has, and never will self-regulate if it means less profitability. There were some good guy manufacturers who were promoting pure food, such as H.J. Heinz Company, but they were the rare exception. Some of these same companies that were willingly putting our health at risk over 100 years ago are still in business: Armour, Swift, Coca-cola, Monsanto, McCormick. Despite the debt we owe him and his Poison Squad volunteers, they and Dr. Wiley have mostly been forgotten today. This book attempts to correct that. I fully appreciated the inclusion of historic photos, political cartoons, and food ads. It was especially gratifying to see the woman working in the chemistry lab in the early 1900's. Deborah Blum also includes Dr. Wiley's wife, Anna Kelton Wiley, who was one of the suffragists jailed by President Wilson. Are these hints at a future book on the womens' suffrage movement? I could completely see how this book could be born out of the research from ""The Poisoner's Handbook"" due to the pure whiskey issue. "
63,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71163840-steven-meyers,5,"If you are under the impression that food was awesome back in the “good ole days,” then, man oh man, Ms. Blum’s book will relieve you of that misconception. ‘The Poison Squad’ shows how business greed and political chicanery worked hand-in-hand to place private interests over consumer safety. As the author states, “Fraud was not just pervasive, it was standard practice.” The decades-long fight over supplying consumers with information about what is in their food and the toxic dangers in it was enlightening but discouraging to read. Ms. Blum is a highly respected author who has written numerous books in the field of science. Her writing style is direct and easy to understand. The years covered are from 1844 through 1938. Buckle up, you’re in for a illuminating scary ride. During the mid-1800s, manufacturers and food processors discovered certain inexpensive chemicals could imitate foods and hide unhealthy diseased meats or other perishable products. Factory environments were hellholes, riddled with unsafe and unclean practices. Into this business atmosphere came Harvey Washington Wiley, a government chemist, who began experiments on the quality of foods, exposed business deceptions, and made the public aware of what their families were eating and drinking. Needless to say, company feces hit the fan big time. While Ms. Blum does center the book on Mr. Wiley’s actions, a plethora of other food safety advocates and detractors are also explained. During his three decades crusading against business chicanery he became a very popular and widely loved individual by the general public. Politicians and businessmen, however, would have liked nothing better than for Mr. Wiley to wind up in a can of corned beef or be fired. I never heard of the guy until I picked up ‘The Poison Squad.’ ‘The Poison Squad’ shows that there were responsible high-minded corporations such as Heinz who practiced and advocated for safe foods and there were plenty of nasty ones such as Monsanto who aggressively fought to allow their “additives” to remain in the market. The way companies acted about possibly having to supply consumers with ingredient information so they could make more informed choices, you’d think it was the next thing to Armageddon. It would be naïve to believe that those awful days are completely gone and corporations now place consumer safety over greed. Sure, like yesteryear, there are businesses that are good corporate stewards but like the old Russian proverb we should, “Trust but verify” before embracing a business’s assertions, especially when it comes to consumer safety. Greed has not somehow magically disappeared. In the author’s epilogue she states, “The story of consumer protection in the United States is often to story of a country playing defense, an account of government regulators waking up, time and time again, to yet another public health crisis.” In other words, once a sizable number of consumers bite the dust and it gets enough press exposure, then politicians and government act. Compared to the time period covered in the book, food safety has greatly improved. However, many businesses still focus on profit over public welfare is still very much with us. Ms. Blum has, yet again, written another highly informative work. Read it and weep."
64,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2125854-becca-younk,3,"I loved The Poisoner's Handbook, so of course I had to read this when I spied it on display at the library. It's not quite as good, but still a compelling and interesting read. It's a bit scary to think about all the ingredients listed on labels that I wouldn't even be able to guess what they are, but at least they're listed! I can google them if I'm so inclined. Whereas previously, food manufacturers could just throw in basically whatever they wanted. The book follows Dr. Wiley at the Agriculture Department as he conducts studies in an effort to pass a Pure Food law. Dr. Wiley sounds great, he ends up marrying a suffragette, which is cool. I think where this book sort of falls flat is all the emphasis on the trials and the inner workings of the Department and politicians. It's interesting for awhile, and then gets a bit tedious and feels a little too much like office drama. While The Poisoner's Handbook gives specific examples of how poisons killed people, this book tends to just list deaths or illnesses as numbers. ""100 children died from such-and-such in Indiana"" type of thing, without going into detail. Food safety isn't as shocking as poisons, sure, but I wish there were more human impact stories. ""Cure-all"" medications are briefly mentioned, and it makes me wonder if Blum will write an entire book on those. Crossing my fingers she does, because that would be fascinating. Twice in the book Blum writes Midland, Michigan, as Midlands, Michigan. Once I can believe is a typo. But twice? It takes two seconds of googling to find that the headquarters of Dow is in Midland, no 's.' I find I'm very annoyed by the lack of caring to get a city name correct. Is publishing in such a bad state that there are no editors?"
65,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4454466-amy,5,"Firstly, I think there should be a law enacted declaring that Deborah Blum must author all history/non-fiction books for popular culture. She has an incredible talent for writing history and, in particular, making the areas of scientific history unbelievably exciting!After thoroughly enjoying her other book, The Poisoner’s Handbook, several years back, I was eager to pick up another one by her. The Poison Squad explores the unique history of food safety laws in the U.S. and the influence of historical figures on the creation of the Food Safety and Drug Administration — specifically Upton Sinclair’s The Jungle and Harvey Washington Wiley, the famous 19th century chemist who identified poisons in everyday manufactured foods we love to eat. The author also provides intriguing cases of food poisoning scandals by manufactured foods throughout the 19th and early 20th century. For example, in June 1899, the city of Cincinnati had to warn its citizens of an epidemic of stomach problems following the consumption of “embalmed” beef. “More than one thousand people had fallen ill in a single week after eating beef.” The culprit? Two new brand-name preservatives at the time that contained formaldehyde as a main ingredient. (p. 61) Truly a fascinating history! So glad we live in the times that we do! Highly recommended read. :-)"
66,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28745526-allie,4,"I came across this book while at the Boston Science museum and knew I had pick it up. It took me several weeks to get through this book but, I still really enjoyed it. This book basically covers the story of Wiley and his fight for food safety regulations. It also discusses the effect politics can have on regulations and consumer protection as well as the creation of the 1906 Pure Food and Drug Act. It is quite alarming to me how we allow politics to impede the creation of regulations to keep people safe. This book provides examples of times when scientists and researchers were providing data about an adulterant saying, ""this can hurt you"" and industry saying, "" no it's fine"" and then politicians agreeing with industry. While we don't want to hurt business and our economy it is important to keep in mind that generally companies in industry are looking out for their own interest. Also I am so grateful for the safety regulations we have now. We don't have to worry about formalin in milk etc. One of my favorite quotes from this book was from Wiley in regards to the purpose of science which is "" to search for truth and thereby to elevate and improve mankind"". "
67,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63521529-beth-menendez,5,"Solid 4.5 stars. I'm dinging it half a star because it is a scince-y book that can get a little dry at times and I think it may lose some readers because of this. However, for anyone who think that the Whole Foods movement and Clean Eating is a new fad, you are gravely mistaken. Deborah Blum does a fantastic job of making Dr. Harvey Washington Wiley come to life. Dr. Washington was the Chief Chemist in the Department of Chemistry and fought for YEARS trying to get congress to approve bills for the Pure Food and Drug movement. Before this movement it was completely legal to add preservatives to food so that spoiled food could then be served to the masses. Yes. Spoiled food. Since mass refrigeration was not really a thing yet, nor was any kind of safety guidelines for chemicals (whether used in food or drugs) all kinds of sketchy things were going on with food for the masses. Milk a little off? No worries, we'll put formaldehyde in it. Oh, was that cow a bit sick? No worries, we'll use some potassium nitrate (saltpeter) to keep it okay. It does not mater that saltpeter will actually kill you. It's cheaper than sodium chloride (table salt) so it's fine. Seriously. The stuff they put in medicines... eek. Just eek. So how does Dr Wiley come in? He began to protest that what manufacturers put in things was deceiving the populations. That maple syrup is not syrup. It's coal tar derived color agents (seriously) and water with a little sugar. Later with a lot of saccharin in it. Because it's cheaper. There were huge arguments over corn syrup as a cheaper additive to foods than sugar. Wait - aren't we STILL arguing about this. Yes, yes we are. After reading this book I am realizing how much has stayed the same and not changed a bit. Oh the topics might be a little different but the court case involving Coca Cola and their ingredients that were both addicting to people and toxic to them that went round and round could be replaced with the energy drinks of today all over the same chemical - caffeine.  The way that what we eat is literally influenced by who is in the White House was a bit of a shock. Dr. Wiley had harder times certain years simply because the president in office elected secretaries that made Dr. Wiley's job almost impossible. The fact that the main secretary to the USDA over him had ties to manufacturing making his job nearly impossible at the end of his term could have read like it was happening today. Upton Sinclair's book The Jungle was more than just a novel - it was a whistle blowing land mine that showed many what was going on with the ""food"" we eat. Even with that book selling thousands of copies there was much attempt to discredit Sinclair which were eventually successful because Sinclair was a socialist - he just wanted everyone to get a fair (clean healthy) shake. Manufacturers and lobbyists were not about to let this happen and so he became a pariah in Washington.  The one thing that resounded throughout the book is how much we fight over the minutiae until there is a national epidemic sadly has not changed. The 1906 original Pure Foods bill (Dr Wiley's bill) came into effect after many children died from the formaldehyde in the milk after YEARS of dying on the floor of Congress. The 1938 bill that beefed (no pun intended) up the bill came about after many children died from taking cough syrup that had been made with sweetened with diethylene glycol (antifreeze). Similar bills were passed in 1956 and 1971 after injury to women and children. Why do I mention this? Because we are STILL fighting this battle - remember when there was salmonella in the peanut butter? Remember how no one could eat salad last Thanksgiving because of E.Coli? Yes, we are still fighting getting clean, pure food from manufacturers. If that is not scary I cannot think what is. Before we look at the past with rose colored glasses we need to realize that the fight for balance of what is actually good for us and what can be had cheaply is still going on. For this reason alone, I highly recommend this book. "
68,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63970501-maureen-caupp,4,"A very interesting read about the work done at the turn of the twentieth century by the United States Department of Agriculture to determine the contents of food and drinks, the impacts of the added compounds on health, and the continuing battle to regulate harmful additives and require truthful labeling. At the turn of the century food manufactures used dangerous preservatives such as formaldehyde in dairy and meats to cover up already spoiling products. Manufactures also used cheap synthetic dyes and flavorings to cut costs. For example ketchup often didn't have tomatoes and strawberry jam didn't contain strawberries. Instead both were any available food scraps left over (pumpkin rinds, apple cores and skins, etc.) dyed red.This book focuses on the efforts of the chief chemist at the USDA for over 30 years around the turn of the century who worked tirelessly and was a strong advocate for regulation and accurate labeling. It also goes into some of the legal battles involved in regulating additives to food and drink. Just like today whenever any regulating legislation managed to get passed into law manufactures pushed back to weaken the new laws. "

IS A MANIFESTO.I follow the two blogs, Barf Blog and Food Safety News, at work, and when this book was published, both of them published blurbs on it, suggesting it was a good read. My coworker, now my manager, requested the library purchase it, and they did! So she borrowed it and said it was fascinating.Then when it came out in paperback, both blogs again ran blurbs, and I checked it out.I would consider this a must-read book. It details so much about common assumptions of the public, government, and business, and WHY government is absolutely essential to putting roadblocks into the path of capitalism.Some might say that the book bogs down a bit when it details all the different shit (sometimes literally) the Bureau of Chemistry was finding in food products, but it never repeated itself, and it honestly could have gone on forever. The borax, the salicylic acid, the lead, it just never stopped coming. The rise of industrial chemistry, while ultimately a good thing, makes me shiver in fear at what it would have been like to have been alive then.Absolutely loved the epilogue where the author warns against this presidential administration pointing out that it directly mirrors what Harvey Washington Wiley was up against.Those who are not students of history are condemned to repeat the past, indeed."

78,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32057224-grace,3,"I think this is an important read to understand the politics and process behind the eventual creation of the FDA. It is essential to understand that throughout time, industry/corporations in masse have actively fought against protecting individuals if they perceived the requested change would have a negative impact on their profit. These corporations have expended significant revenue to market the political idea of the deregulation of all the things. This book is a great example of why, as a society, there is a necessity for many of the existing regulations. It also does a good job of highlighting corporations and individuals who were open to change and saw the value in a pure food movement and how it could be economically and socially beneficial. Personally, I think I should have read this slower and just read a chapter here and there. To some extent, the chapters and build up were formulaic and came off as a tad dense. This is likely because the majority of the book discussed how a food or beverage was adulterated and the steps taken to stop the incorrect labeling or toxic additives. The adulterations were often similar and the process of fighting the deceptions would be similar, ie. education of the public and the attempt to pass laws to prohibit the additives or mislabeling. Due to the somewhat repetitive nature, I think I would have liked to spread out this book. With that said, I still enjoyed this read and recommend it! If I could I would have given it 3.5 and probably would have been a 4.0 had a read it like I suggested above."

85,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6293008-filippe,5,"“The Shutdown is Bad For Anyone Who Eats Food”, says Stephen Colbert on Friday, January 11. “Don't Panic: The Government Shutdown Isn't Making Food Unsafe”, counters NPR’s Dan Charles on Weekend Update the following morning.It’s 2019, but you’d be forgiven for thinking of pre-1906 America after reading this wonderful account of the U.S. “pure food movement” and its most steadfast defender and all-around gadfly, chemist Harvey W. Wiley, a man I’d heard nothing about before. As in all of her previous books, Blum’s conversational tone belies meticulous research and attention to detail. Each chapter, charmingly epigraphed with a line or verse from a poem by Wiley himself, is filled with quotations from primary sources; ancillary characters are given their due. Decades of political warfare and industry opposition to pure-food-and-drug laws (familiar names such as Monsanto, Dow Chemical, and Coca-Cola all make unflattering appearances) are richly described.The hand-wringing ineffectiveness of early enforcement, endless concessions to regulation-hating manufacturers, conflicts of interest, and downright corruption in the Department of Agriculture and elsewhere are frustrating, unsurprising, and terribly modern, but I sometimes found myself equally exasperated by Wiley’s crusader-style single-mindedness (that word’s in the title for a reason).I do wish the book had focused more on Wiley’s later-life work with Good Housekeeping Laboratories and covered a bit more of the history of the Food and Drug Administration (newly founded at the book’s close and Wiley’s death in 1930). I wish Wiley’s work and that of the pure-food defenders was not still under continuous undermining more than a century later, as the Epilogue notes. And, tangentially, I would love to read a similar biography/history of Frances Oldham Kelsey’s half-century of work at the FDA. What a lovely parallel (or sequel) that would make."

89,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76170804-judy-monchuk,4,"What a fascinating and frightening read. This history of the fight for food safety laws in the United States is a disturbing page-turner that literally kept me up at night because I didn’t want to put it down.As food manufacturers in the late 19th century embraced chemicals as preservatives, sweeteners or colourants to keep food bright and tasty, they were under no obligation to tell customers what was in their milk or meat, coffee or candy. Whiskey might not even be whiskey. Children died after drinking “chemically improved” milk, canned meat sent to soldiers fighting in the Spanish-American war was described as “embalmed beef.” Formaldehyde was used to deal with the sour taste of milk and extend its life, while chalk was added to whiten it. Borax improved the taste of rancid butter, candy was coloured with poisonous dyes that included arsenic or lead. Saccharine (marketed by Monsanto more than a century ago) presented a health risk if consumed in large enough doses, which was likely because it was an unlabelled sweetener in many products: from soft drinks to jam to canned vegetables. There was no requirement for any food to be or even include what it said it was. Spices could be predominantly anything but the pepper or ginger promised on the bottle, which may include burned shells, charcoal and even floor sweepings. Honey was often tinted corn syrup, tea leaves may not be tea and “fraud was not just pervasive; it was standard practice.”Any effort to introduce safety testing or require a breakdown of ingredients was met with sharp resistance from industry, which often received a sympathetic ear in the White House across a handful of administrations. At the dawn of the 20th century, the manufacturer of a formaldehyde-infused preservative called Freezine argued that the public should just embrace whatever chemicals prevented food decay without question, noting “I wish to say that every one of us eats embalmed meat and we know it and we like it.” Weaving all of this together is a biography of chemist Dr. Harvey Wiley, who refused to back down in his quest for consumer protection. Wiley, chief chemist for the US Department of Agriculture, spent decades fighting for regulations, investigation and even basic labelling to inform consumers what was their food or drinks. The Pure Food and Drug Act, passed in 1906, was known to many as “Dr. Wiley’s law” although he is largely a footnote in history today. In his later years, Wiley was bitter about the struggle and the constant pushback from industry for any regulation. Pulitzer Prize-winning science journalist Deborah Blum has done a fabulous job of bringing this era to life and outlining the challenges facing Wiley and others who tried to spotlight the importance of food safety. It’s rare to celebrate the efforts of a civil servant, especially where those who work for the public good are often painted by politicians as an impediment to business, a consideration spelled out in Wiley’s day. It’s also very true in the 21st century, where the current president vowed to eliminate any regulation that kills jobs. The Poison Squad: One Chemist's Single-Minded Crusade for Food Safety at the Turn of the Twentieth Century is a first-rate thriller. 4.5 stars."
90,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72623806-nicholle,5,"I give this book 5 stars (out of 5). I loved the science/chemistry and history behind the story. The author is an excellent science writer and wrote such an intriguing story. The parts where she described the politics behind the story were boring to me (I cannot stand politics), but a necessary evil in order to describe how the story played out. This story is about chemist Dr. Harvey Washington Wiley and how he wanted to make sure that all food was safe, or at least labeled, from adulterants. Such adulterants were arsenic, dyes from coal tar, and boric acid (or borax), just to name a few. He was truly a man ahead of his time because during a time where most individuals (and even companies) were ignorant of science and most companies producing food only cared about making a profit, he strove to make sure food was safe from unnecessary additives (or adulterants) by actually testing the additives to prove that they were in fact harmful to people.Dr. Wiley set up experiments to feed a group of individuals adulterants, such as boric acid, by comparing that group against a control group not being fed adulterants. The data he and his team of chemists generated was not only rigorous and scientific, but also proved his hypothesis that the adulterants being added to food were in fact harmful to people. Taking this data a step further, he extrapolated that if these adulterants were harmful to healthy (male) adults, these adulterants were even more harmful to babies, children, and the elderly. Dr. Wiley fought almost his whole career against the politics of the unscrupulous lobby behind the companies making the adulterated foods. What I found so fascinating was that among the few companies that did mass produce food without adulterants was the company that made Heinz ketchup. The owner behind the ketchup not only wanted to make food without adulterants, but he also wanted to prove that making unadulterated food could be profitable, since that was the main argument behind the companies that adulterated food was that they could not be profitable. What I truly loved about Dr. Wiley was his desire to speak up about the chemistry behind the adulterants, without dumbing it down, to women. He wrote countless articles in magazines and publications geared towards women. He knew that getting women (who make up 50% of the population) on board with his cause would only further his fight in the political arena to achieve his goals. Dr. Wiley even married a suffragist and supported her desire to be jailed for her fight for women to vote.Another aspect I found so fascinating about this book is the role the government needs to play to protect the average American, or consumer, from unregulated business that cares more about profit than the health of the consumer by taking shortcuts. While I read this book the government shut down was occurring. And it also seems the trend in the current administration is to cozy up to big business that may or may not care about the average American consumer in their bottom line. Only time will tell if this is occurring, and unfortunately as history does repeat itself, who (and how many) will have to get sick and or die before government steps in to protect the average American consumer? "
91,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56837139-brandon-polzin,3,"This book was an enjoyable narrative about a story that I never thought I would be interested in. The topic of food safety is a vitally important one, and I am grateful that a person like Harvey Washington Wiley had a lifelong goal of supporting food transparency for the benefit of the United States' citizens. I am a sucker for the time period in American History that a large portion of this book is set in, as Theodore Roosevelt is one of my favorite historical figures. He is painted as a protagonist in most of the other books that I've read, so it was amusing to see him portrayed in an antagonistic light here.All that being said, I felt this book had a few shortcomings. I may be spoiled after reading biographical narratives by Siddharta Mukherjee and Edmund Morris, but I felt illustrative descriptions of characters and settings were lacking in this book. I certainly was never bored, but it lacked the fiction-like and seemingly whimsical appeal of other critically acclaimed nonfiction narratives. It may be, though, that the nature of this story was not as exciting as those I am comparing it to, so I don't want to place the blame solely on Blum's shoulders.Another issue I had was the intermittent lack of focus/mislabeling of the book. The subtitle of the book (""One Chemist's...) implies that it is a biography about one man, that man being the aforementioned Wiley. Blum went into great detail about him, but would then move on to other parallel stories that coincided with the progression of food safety within the United States. This was obviously all relevant to the overarching story the book was trying to tell, but because of the excessive breaks from Wiley I felt this book should have been explicitly marketed as a story of food safety as a whole, not JUST as a narrative about Wiley. It's a nitpicky criticism, but I found myself being taken out of the story and thinking about it as I read the book.All in all though, I would recommend this book. I love that there was a ""cast of characters"" in the beginning to reference to whenever I forgot about a person's name or their significance. I also loved they way Blum used the story of food safety in the USA to emphasize the control that big business has over the way consumers act and think as a whole, and the importance of a dissenting opinion when everyone is all too eager to comply.I would rate this book a 3.5 if I could, but I'll round up because I'm feeling nice. I hope you can get your hands on a copy sometime soon!"

Having worked in QA in the pharmaceutical industry, I was familiar with the Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906 as the beginning of the regulation of pharmaceuticals, but hadn't really known that its major impetus was on food and I had never heard of the man who had such a big part of making it law, Dr. Harvey Washington Wiley. It was not just unclean production practices that put the food supply at risk of contamination. The dangers included what was purposefully added like heavy metal and coal tar food dyes, especially in candy; formaldehyde in meat and milk; preservatives that had never been tested for safety of human consumption; sugar replacements that had no caloric value; and other fillers added just to improve the profit margin. Some of these additives were even marketed to grocers and food producers solely based on their ability to be undetected and increase profitability by dilution of the actual food product or by masking spoilage. People were literally being killed by the food they ate. The book details just how adulterated our food supply was prior to this act, how much industry worked to keep it that way, how much politicians were unconcerned about the health and welfare of the common person, and how hard Dr. Wiley had to work to protect consumers. Some things never really change and the parallels to our modern world are easy to see. Industry does not, never has, and never will self-regulate if it means less profitability. There were some good guy manufacturers who were promoting pure food, such as H.J. Heinz Company, but they were the rare exception. Some of these same companies that were willingly putting our health at risk over 100 years ago are still in business: Armour, Swift, Coca-cola, Monsanto, McCormick. Despite the debt we owe him and his Poison Squad volunteers, they and Dr. Wiley have mostly been forgotten today. This book attempts to correct that. I fully appreciated the inclusion of historic photos, political cartoons, and food ads. It was especially gratifying to see the woman working in the chemistry lab in the early 1900's. Deborah Blum also includes Dr. Wiley's wife, Anna Kelton Wiley, who was one of the suffragists jailed by President Wilson. Are these hints at a future book on the womens' suffrage movement? I could completely see how this book could be born out of the research from ""The Poisoner's Handbook"" due to the pure whiskey issue. "
93,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71163840-steven-meyers,5,"If you are under the impression that food was awesome back in the “good ole days,” then, man oh man, Ms. Blum’s book will relieve you of that misconception. ‘The Poison Squad’ shows how business greed and political chicanery worked hand-in-hand to place private interests over consumer safety. As the author states, “Fraud was not just pervasive, it was standard practice.” The decades-long fight over supplying consumers with information about what is in their food and the toxic dangers in it was enlightening but discouraging to read. Ms. Blum is a highly respected author who has written numerous books in the field of science. Her writing style is direct and easy to understand. The years covered are from 1844 through 1938. Buckle up, you’re in for a illuminating scary ride. During the mid-1800s, manufacturers and food processors discovered certain inexpensive chemicals could imitate foods and hide unhealthy diseased meats or other perishable products. Factory environments were hellholes, riddled with unsafe and unclean practices. Into this business atmosphere came Harvey Washington Wiley, a government chemist, who began experiments on the quality of foods, exposed business deceptions, and made the public aware of what their families were eating and drinking. Needless to say, company feces hit the fan big time. While Ms. Blum does center the book on Mr. Wiley’s actions, a plethora of other food safety advocates and detractors are also explained. During his three decades crusading against business chicanery he became a very popular and widely loved individual by the general public. Politicians and businessmen, however, would have liked nothing better than for Mr. Wiley to wind up in a can of corned beef or be fired. I never heard of the guy until I picked up ‘The Poison Squad.’ ‘The Poison Squad’ shows that there were responsible high-minded corporations such as Heinz who practiced and advocated for safe foods and there were plenty of nasty ones such as Monsanto who aggressively fought to allow their “additives” to remain in the market. The way companies acted about possibly having to supply consumers with ingredient information so they could make more informed choices, you’d think it was the next thing to Armageddon. It would be naïve to believe that those awful days are completely gone and corporations now place consumer safety over greed. Sure, like yesteryear, there are businesses that are good corporate stewards but like the old Russian proverb we should, “Trust but verify” before embracing a business’s assertions, especially when it comes to consumer safety. Greed has not somehow magically disappeared. In the author’s epilogue she states, “The story of consumer protection in the United States is often to story of a country playing defense, an account of government regulators waking up, time and time again, to yet another public health crisis.” In other words, once a sizable number of consumers bite the dust and it gets enough press exposure, then politicians and government act. Compared to the time period covered in the book, food safety has greatly improved. However, many businesses still focus on profit over public welfare is still very much with us. Ms. Blum has, yet again, written another highly informative work. Read it and weep."
94,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2125854-becca-younk,3,"I loved The Poisoner's Handbook, so of course I had to read this when I spied it on display at the library. It's not quite as good, but still a compelling and interesting read. It's a bit scary to think about all the ingredients listed on labels that I wouldn't even be able to guess what they are, but at least they're listed! I can google them if I'm so inclined. Whereas previously, food manufacturers could just throw in basically whatever they wanted. The book follows Dr. Wiley at the Agriculture Department as he conducts studies in an effort to pass a Pure Food law. Dr. Wiley sounds great, he ends up marrying a suffragette, which is cool. I think where this book sort of falls flat is all the emphasis on the trials and the inner workings of the Department and politicians. It's interesting for awhile, and then gets a bit tedious and feels a little too much like office drama. While The Poisoner's Handbook gives specific examples of how poisons killed people, this book tends to just list deaths or illnesses as numbers. ""100 children died from such-and-such in Indiana"" type of thing, without going into detail. Food safety isn't as shocking as poisons, sure, but I wish there were more human impact stories. ""Cure-all"" medications are briefly mentioned, and it makes me wonder if Blum will write an entire book on those. Crossing my fingers she does, because that would be fascinating. Twice in the book Blum writes Midland, Michigan, as Midlands, Michigan. Once I can believe is a typo. But twice? It takes two seconds of googling to find that the headquarters of Dow is in Midland, no 's.' I find I'm very annoyed by the lack of caring to get a city name correct. Is publishing in such a bad state that there are no editors?"
95,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4454466-amy,5,"Firstly, I think there should be a law enacted declaring that Deborah Blum must author all history/non-fiction books for popular culture. She has an incredible talent for writing history and, in particular, making the areas of scientific history unbelievably exciting!After thoroughly enjoying her other book, The Poisoner’s Handbook, several years back, I was eager to pick up another one by her. The Poison Squad explores the unique history of food safety laws in the U.S. and the influence of historical figures on the creation of the Food Safety and Drug Administration — specifically Upton Sinclair’s The Jungle and Harvey Washington Wiley, the famous 19th century chemist who identified poisons in everyday manufactured foods we love to eat. The author also provides intriguing cases of food poisoning scandals by manufactured foods throughout the 19th and early 20th century. For example, in June 1899, the city of Cincinnati had to warn its citizens of an epidemic of stomach problems following the consumption of “embalmed” beef. “More than one thousand people had fallen ill in a single week after eating beef.” The culprit? Two new brand-name preservatives at the time that contained formaldehyde as a main ingredient. (p. 61) Truly a fascinating history! So glad we live in the times that we do! Highly recommended read. :-)"

It took me several weeks to get through this book but, I still really enjoyed it. This book basically covers the story of Wiley and his fight for food safety regulations. It also discusses the effect politics can have on regulations and consumer protection as well as the creation of the 1906 Pure Food and Drug Act. It is quite alarming to me how we allow politics to impede the creation of regulations to keep people safe. This book provides examples of times when scientists and researchers were providing data about an adulterant saying, ""this can hurt you"" and industry saying, "" no it's fine"" and then politicians agreeing with industry. While we don't want to hurt business and our economy it is important to keep in mind that generally companies in industry are looking out for their own interest. Also I am so grateful for the safety regulations we have now. We don't have to worry about formalin in milk etc. One of my favorite quotes from this book was from Wiley in regards to the purpose of science which is "" to search for truth and thereby to elevate and improve mankind"". "
97,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63521529-beth-menendez,5,"Solid 4.5 stars. I'm dinging it half a star because it is a scince-y book that can get a little dry at times and I think it may lose some readers because of this. However, for anyone who think that the Whole Foods movement and Clean Eating is a new fad, you are gravely mistaken. Deborah Blum does a fantastic job of making Dr. Harvey Washington Wiley come to life. Dr. Washington was the Chief Chemist in the Department of Chemistry and fought for YEARS trying to get congress to approve bills for the Pure Food and Drug movement. Before this movement it was completely legal to add preservatives to food so that spoiled food could then be served to the masses. Yes. Spoiled food. Since mass refrigeration was not really a thing yet, nor was any kind of safety guidelines for chemicals (whether used in food or drugs) all kinds of sketchy things were going on with food for the masses. Milk a little off? No worries, we'll put formaldehyde in it. Oh, was that cow a bit sick? No worries, we'll use some potassium nitrate (saltpeter) to keep it okay. It does not mater that saltpeter will actually kill you. It's cheaper than sodium chloride (table salt) so it's fine. Seriously. The stuff they put in medicines... eek. Just eek. So how does Dr Wiley come in? He began to protest that what manufacturers put in things was deceiving the populations. That maple syrup is not syrup. It's coal tar derived color agents (seriously) and water with a little sugar. Later with a lot of saccharin in it. Because it's cheaper. There were huge arguments over corn syrup as a cheaper additive to foods than sugar. Wait - aren't we STILL arguing about this. Yes, yes we are. After reading this book I am realizing how much has stayed the same and not changed a bit. Oh the topics might be a little different but the court case involving Coca Cola and their ingredients that were both addicting to people and toxic to them that went round and round could be replaced with the energy drinks of today all over the same chemical - caffeine.  The way that what we eat is literally influenced by who is in the White House was a bit of a shock. Dr. Wiley had harder times certain years simply because the president in office elected secretaries that made Dr. Wiley's job almost impossible. The fact that the main secretary to the USDA over him had ties to manufacturing making his job nearly impossible at the end of his term could have read like it was happening today. Upton Sinclair's book The Jungle was more than just a novel - it was a whistle blowing land mine that showed many what was going on with the ""food"" we eat. Even with that book selling thousands of copies there was much attempt to discredit Sinclair which were eventually successful because Sinclair was a socialist - he just wanted everyone to get a fair (clean healthy) shake. Manufacturers and lobbyists were not about to let this happen and so he became a pariah in Washington.  The one thing that resounded throughout the book is how much we fight over the minutiae until there is a national epidemic sadly has not changed. The 1906 original Pure Foods bill (Dr Wiley's bill) came into effect after many children died from the formaldehyde in the milk after YEARS of dying on the floor of Congress. The 1938 bill that beefed (no pun intended) up the bill came about after many children died from taking cough syrup that had been made with sweetened with diethylene glycol (antifreeze). Similar bills were passed in 1956 and 1971 after injury to women and children. Why do I mention this? Because we are STILL fighting this battle - remember when there was salmonella in the peanut butter? Remember how no one could eat salad last Thanksgiving because of E.Coli? Yes, we are still fighting getting clean, pure food from manufacturers. If that is not scary I cannot think what is. Before we look at the past with rose colored glasses we need to realize that the fight for balance of what is actually good for us and what can be had cheaply is still going on. For this reason alone, I highly recommend this book. "
98,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63970501-maureen-caupp,4,"A very interesting read about the work done at the turn of the twentieth century by the United States Department of Agriculture to determine the contents of food and drinks, the impacts of the added compounds on health, and the continuing battle to regulate harmful additives and require truthful labeling. At the turn of the century food manufactures used dangerous preservatives such as formaldehyde in dairy and meats to cover up already spoiling products. Manufactures also used cheap synthetic dyes and flavorings to cut costs. For example ketchup often didn't have tomatoes and strawberry jam didn't contain strawberries. Instead both were any available food scraps left over (pumpkin rinds, apple cores and skins, etc.) dyed red.This book focuses on the efforts of the chief chemist at the USDA for over 30 years around the turn of the century who worked tirelessly and was a strong advocate for regulation and accurate labeling. It also goes into some of the legal battles involved in regulating additives to food and drink. Just like today whenever any regulating legislation managed to get passed into law manufactures pushed back to weaken the new laws. "

My coworker, now my manager, requested the library purchase it, and they did! So she borrowed it and said it was fascinating.Then when it came out in paperback, both blogs again ran blurbs, and I checked it out.I would consider this a must-read book. It details so much about common assumptions of the public, government, and business, and WHY government is absolutely essential to putting roadblocks into the path of capitalism.Some might say that the book bogs down a bit when it details all the different shit (sometimes literally) the Bureau of Chemistry was finding in food products, but it never repeated itself, and it honestly could have gone on forever. The borax, the salicylic acid, the lead, it just never stopped coming. The rise of industrial chemistry, while ultimately a good thing, makes me shiver in fear at what it would have been like to have been alive then.Absolutely loved the epilogue where the author warns against this presidential administration pointing out that it directly mirrors what Harvey Washington Wiley was up against.Those who are not students of history are condemned to repeat the past, indeed."

It is essential to understand that throughout time, industry/corporations in masse have actively fought against protecting individuals if they perceived the requested change would have a negative impact on their profit. These corporations have expended significant revenue to market the political idea of the deregulation of all the things. This book is a great example of why, as a society, there is a necessity for many of the existing regulations. It also does a good job of highlighting corporations and individuals who were open to change and saw the value in a pure food movement and how it could be economically and socially beneficial. Personally, I think I should have read this slower and just read a chapter here and there. To some extent, the chapters and build up were formulaic and came off as a tad dense. This is likely because the majority of the book discussed how a food or beverage was adulterated and the steps taken to stop the incorrect labeling or toxic additives. The adulterations were often similar and the process of fighting the deceptions would be similar, ie. education of the public and the attempt to pass laws to prohibit the additives or mislabeling. Due to the somewhat repetitive nature, I think I would have liked to spread out this book. With that said, I still enjoyed this read and recommend it! If I could I would have given it 3.5 and probably would have been a 4.0 had a read it like I suggested above."

115,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6293008-filippe,5,"“The Shutdown is Bad For Anyone Who Eats Food”, says Stephen Colbert on Friday, January 11. “Don't Panic: The Government Shutdown Isn't Making Food Unsafe”, counters NPR’s Dan Charles on Weekend Update the following morning.It’s 2019, but you’d be forgiven for thinking of pre-1906 America after reading this wonderful account of the U.S. “pure food movement” and its most steadfast defender and all-around gadfly, chemist Harvey W. Wiley, a man I’d heard nothing about before. As in all of her previous books, Blum’s conversational tone belies meticulous research and attention to detail. Each chapter, charmingly epigraphed with a line or verse from a poem by Wiley himself, is filled with quotations from primary sources; ancillary characters are given their due. Decades of political warfare and industry opposition to pure-food-and-drug laws (familiar names such as Monsanto, Dow Chemical, and Coca-Cola all make unflattering appearances) are richly described.The hand-wringing ineffectiveness of early enforcement, endless concessions to regulation-hating manufacturers, conflicts of interest, and downright corruption in the Department of Agriculture and elsewhere are frustrating, unsurprising, and terribly modern, but I sometimes found myself equally exasperated by Wiley’s crusader-style single-mindedness (that word’s in the title for a reason).I do wish the book had focused more on Wiley’s later-life work with Good Housekeeping Laboratories and covered a bit more of the history of the Food and Drug Administration (newly founded at the book’s close and Wiley’s death in 1930). I wish Wiley’s work and that of the pure-food defenders was not still under continuous undermining more than a century later, as the Epilogue notes. And, tangentially, I would love to read a similar biography/history of Frances Oldham Kelsey’s half-century of work at the FDA. What a lovely parallel (or sequel) that would make."

119,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76170804-judy-monchuk,4,"What a fascinating and frightening read. This history of the fight for food safety laws in the United States is a disturbing page-turner that literally kept me up at night because I didn’t want to put it down.As food manufacturers in the late 19th century embraced chemicals as preservatives, sweeteners or colourants to keep food bright and tasty, they were under no obligation to tell customers what was in their milk or meat, coffee or candy. Whiskey might not even be whiskey. Children died after drinking “chemically improved” milk, canned meat sent to soldiers fighting in the Spanish-American war was described as “embalmed beef.” Formaldehyde was used to deal with the sour taste of milk and extend its life, while chalk was added to whiten it. Borax improved the taste of rancid butter, candy was coloured with poisonous dyes that included arsenic or lead. Saccharine (marketed by Monsanto more than a century ago) presented a health risk if consumed in large enough doses, which was likely because it was an unlabelled sweetener in many products: from soft drinks to jam to canned vegetables. There was no requirement for any food to be or even include what it said it was. Spices could be predominantly anything but the pepper or ginger promised on the bottle, which may include burned shells, charcoal and even floor sweepings. Honey was often tinted corn syrup, tea leaves may not be tea and “fraud was not just pervasive; it was standard practice.”Any effort to introduce safety testing or require a breakdown of ingredients was met with sharp resistance from industry, which often received a sympathetic ear in the White House across a handful of administrations. At the dawn of the 20th century, the manufacturer of a formaldehyde-infused preservative called Freezine argued that the public should just embrace whatever chemicals prevented food decay without question, noting “I wish to say that every one of us eats embalmed meat and we know it and we like it.” Weaving all of this together is a biography of chemist Dr. Harvey Wiley, who refused to back down in his quest for consumer protection. Wiley, chief chemist for the US Department of Agriculture, spent decades fighting for regulations, investigation and even basic labelling to inform consumers what was their food or drinks. The Pure Food and Drug Act, passed in 1906, was known to many as “Dr. Wiley’s law” although he is largely a footnote in history today. In his later years, Wiley was bitter about the struggle and the constant pushback from industry for any regulation. Pulitzer Prize-winning science journalist Deborah Blum has done a fabulous job of bringing this era to life and outlining the challenges facing Wiley and others who tried to spotlight the importance of food safety. It’s rare to celebrate the efforts of a civil servant, especially where those who work for the public good are often painted by politicians as an impediment to business, a consideration spelled out in Wiley’s day. It’s also very true in the 21st century, where the current president vowed to eliminate any regulation that kills jobs. The Poison Squad: One Chemist's Single-Minded Crusade for Food Safety at the Turn of the Twentieth Century is a first-rate thriller. 4.5 stars."
120,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72623806-nicholle,5,"I give this book 5 stars (out of 5). I loved the science/chemistry and history behind the story. The author is an excellent science writer and wrote such an intriguing story. The parts where she described the politics behind the story were boring to me (I cannot stand politics), but a necessary evil in order to describe how the story played out. This story is about chemist Dr. Harvey Washington Wiley and how he wanted to make sure that all food was safe, or at least labeled, from adulterants. Such adulterants were arsenic, dyes from coal tar, and boric acid (or borax), just to name a few. He was truly a man ahead of his time because during a time where most individuals (and even companies) were ignorant of science and most companies producing food only cared about making a profit, he strove to make sure food was safe from unnecessary additives (or adulterants) by actually testing the additives to prove that they were in fact harmful to people.Dr. Wiley set up experiments to feed a group of individuals adulterants, such as boric acid, by comparing that group against a control group not being fed adulterants. The data he and his team of chemists generated was not only rigorous and scientific, but also proved his hypothesis that the adulterants being added to food were in fact harmful to people. Taking this data a step further, he extrapolated that if these adulterants were harmful to healthy (male) adults, these adulterants were even more harmful to babies, children, and the elderly. Dr. Wiley fought almost his whole career against the politics of the unscrupulous lobby behind the companies making the adulterated foods. What I found so fascinating was that among the few companies that did mass produce food without adulterants was the company that made Heinz ketchup. The owner behind the ketchup not only wanted to make food without adulterants, but he also wanted to prove that making unadulterated food could be profitable, since that was the main argument behind the companies that adulterated food was that they could not be profitable. What I truly loved about Dr. Wiley was his desire to speak up about the chemistry behind the adulterants, without dumbing it down, to women. He wrote countless articles in magazines and publications geared towards women. He knew that getting women (who make up 50% of the population) on board with his cause would only further his fight in the political arena to achieve his goals. Dr. Wiley even married a suffragist and supported her desire to be jailed for her fight for women to vote.Another aspect I found so fascinating about this book is the role the government needs to play to protect the average American, or consumer, from unregulated business that cares more about profit than the health of the consumer by taking shortcuts. While I read this book the government shut down was occurring. And it also seems the trend in the current administration is to cozy up to big business that may or may not care about the average American consumer in their bottom line. Only time will tell if this is occurring, and unfortunately as history does repeat itself, who (and how many) will have to get sick and or die before government steps in to protect the average American consumer? "
121,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56837139-brandon-polzin,3,"This book was an enjoyable narrative about a story that I never thought I would be interested in. The topic of food safety is a vitally important one, and I am grateful that a person like Harvey Washington Wiley had a lifelong goal of supporting food transparency for the benefit of the United States' citizens. I am a sucker for the time period in American History that a large portion of this book is set in, as Theodore Roosevelt is one of my favorite historical figures. He is painted as a protagonist in most of the other books that I've read, so it was amusing to see him portrayed in an antagonistic light here.All that being said, I felt this book had a few shortcomings. I may be spoiled after reading biographical narratives by Siddharta Mukherjee and Edmund Morris, but I felt illustrative descriptions of characters and settings were lacking in this book. I certainly was never bored, but it lacked the fiction-like and seemingly whimsical appeal of other critically acclaimed nonfiction narratives. It may be, though, that the nature of this story was not as exciting as those I am comparing it to, so I don't want to place the blame solely on Blum's shoulders.Another issue I had was the intermittent lack of focus/mislabeling of the book. The subtitle of the book (""One Chemist's...) implies that it is a biography about one man, that man being the aforementioned Wiley. Blum went into great detail about him, but would then move on to other parallel stories that coincided with the progression of food safety within the United States. This was obviously all relevant to the overarching story the book was trying to tell, but because of the excessive breaks from Wiley I felt this book should have been explicitly marketed as a story of food safety as a whole, not JUST as a narrative about Wiley. It's a nitpicky criticism, but I found myself being taken out of the story and thinking about it as I read the book.All in all though, I would recommend this book. I love that there was a ""cast of characters"" in the beginning to reference to whenever I forgot about a person's name or their significance. I also loved they way Blum used the story of food safety in the USA to emphasize the control that big business has over the way consumers act and think as a whole, and the importance of a dissenting opinion when everyone is all too eager to comply.I would rate this book a 3.5 if I could, but I'll round up because I'm feeling nice. I hope you can get your hands on a copy sometime soon!"

Having worked in QA in the pharmaceutical industry, I was familiar with the Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906 as the beginning of the regulation of pharmaceuticals, but hadn't really known that its major impetus was on food and I had never heard of the man who had such a big part of making it law, Dr. Harvey Washington Wiley. It was not just unclean production practices that put the food supply at risk of contamination. The dangers included what was purposefully added like heavy metal and coal tar food dyes, especially in candy; formaldehyde in meat and milk; preservatives that had never been tested for safety of human consumption; sugar replacements that had no caloric value; and other fillers added just to improve the profit margin. Some of these additives were even marketed to grocers and food producers solely based on their ability to be undetected and increase profitability by dilution of the actual food product or by masking spoilage. People were literally being killed by the food they ate. The book details just how adulterated our food supply was prior to this act, how much industry worked to keep it that way, how much politicians were unconcerned about the health and welfare of the common person, and how hard Dr. Wiley had to work to protect consumers. Some things never really change and the parallels to our modern world are easy to see. Industry does not, never has, and never will self-regulate if it means less profitability. There were some good guy manufacturers who were promoting pure food, such as H.J. Heinz Company, but they were the rare exception. Some of these same companies that were willingly putting our health at risk over 100 years ago are still in business: Armour, Swift, Coca-cola, Monsanto, McCormick. Despite the debt we owe him and his Poison Squad volunteers, they and Dr. Wiley have mostly been forgotten today. This book attempts to correct that. I fully appreciated the inclusion of historic photos, political cartoons, and food ads. It was especially gratifying to see the woman working in the chemistry lab in the early 1900's. Deborah Blum also includes Dr. Wiley's wife, Anna Kelton Wiley, who was one of the suffragists jailed by President Wilson. Are these hints at a future book on the womens' suffrage movement? I could completely see how this book could be born out of the research from ""The Poisoner's Handbook"" due to the pure whiskey issue. "
123,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71163840-steven-meyers,5,"If you are under the impression that food was awesome back in the “good ole days,” then, man oh man, Ms. Blum’s book will relieve you of that misconception. ‘The Poison Squad’ shows how business greed and political chicanery worked hand-in-hand to place private interests over consumer safety. As the author states, “Fraud was not just pervasive, it was standard practice.” The decades-long fight over supplying consumers with information about what is in their food and the toxic dangers in it was enlightening but discouraging to read. Ms. Blum is a highly respected author who has written numerous books in the field of science. Her writing style is direct and easy to understand. The years covered are from 1844 through 1938. Buckle up, you’re in for a illuminating scary ride. During the mid-1800s, manufacturers and food processors discovered certain inexpensive chemicals could imitate foods and hide unhealthy diseased meats or other perishable products. Factory environments were hellholes, riddled with unsafe and unclean practices. Into this business atmosphere came Harvey Washington Wiley, a government chemist, who began experiments on the quality of foods, exposed business deceptions, and made the public aware of what their families were eating and drinking. Needless to say, company feces hit the fan big time. While Ms. Blum does center the book on Mr. Wiley’s actions, a plethora of other food safety advocates and detractors are also explained. During his three decades crusading against business chicanery he became a very popular and widely loved individual by the general public. Politicians and businessmen, however, would have liked nothing better than for Mr. Wiley to wind up in a can of corned beef or be fired. I never heard of the guy until I picked up ‘The Poison Squad.’ ‘The Poison Squad’ shows that there were responsible high-minded corporations such as Heinz who practiced and advocated for safe foods and there were plenty of nasty ones such as Monsanto who aggressively fought to allow their “additives” to remain in the market. The way companies acted about possibly having to supply consumers with ingredient information so they could make more informed choices, you’d think it was the next thing to Armageddon. It would be naïve to believe that those awful days are completely gone and corporations now place consumer safety over greed. Sure, like yesteryear, there are businesses that are good corporate stewards but like the old Russian proverb we should, “Trust but verify” before embracing a business’s assertions, especially when it comes to consumer safety. Greed has not somehow magically disappeared. In the author’s epilogue she states, “The story of consumer protection in the United States is often to story of a country playing defense, an account of government regulators waking up, time and time again, to yet another public health crisis.” In other words, once a sizable number of consumers bite the dust and it gets enough press exposure, then politicians and government act. Compared to the time period covered in the book, food safety has greatly improved. However, many businesses still focus on profit over public welfare is still very much with us. Ms. Blum has, yet again, written another highly informative work. Read it and weep."
124,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2125854-becca-younk,3,"I loved The Poisoner's Handbook, so of course I had to read this when I spied it on display at the library. It's not quite as good, but still a compelling and interesting read. It's a bit scary to think about all the ingredients listed on labels that I wouldn't even be able to guess what they are, but at least they're listed! I can google them if I'm so inclined. Whereas previously, food manufacturers could just throw in basically whatever they wanted. The book follows Dr. Wiley at the Agriculture Department as he conducts studies in an effort to pass a Pure Food law. Dr. Wiley sounds great, he ends up marrying a suffragette, which is cool. I think where this book sort of falls flat is all the emphasis on the trials and the inner workings of the Department and politicians. It's interesting for awhile, and then gets a bit tedious and feels a little too much like office drama. While The Poisoner's Handbook gives specific examples of how poisons killed people, this book tends to just list deaths or illnesses as numbers. ""100 children died from such-and-such in Indiana"" type of thing, without going into detail. Food safety isn't as shocking as poisons, sure, but I wish there were more human impact stories. ""Cure-all"" medications are briefly mentioned, and it makes me wonder if Blum will write an entire book on those. Crossing my fingers she does, because that would be fascinating. Twice in the book Blum writes Midland, Michigan, as Midlands, Michigan. Once I can believe is a typo. But twice? It takes two seconds of googling to find that the headquarters of Dow is in Midland, no 's.' I find I'm very annoyed by the lack of caring to get a city name correct. Is publishing in such a bad state that there are no editors?"
125,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4454466-amy,5,"Firstly, I think there should be a law enacted declaring that Deborah Blum must author all history/non-fiction books for popular culture. She has an incredible talent for writing history and, in particular, making the areas of scientific history unbelievably exciting!After thoroughly enjoying her other book, The Poisoner’s Handbook, several years back, I was eager to pick up another one by her. The Poison Squad explores the unique history of food safety laws in the U.S. and the influence of historical figures on the creation of the Food Safety and Drug Administration — specifically Upton Sinclair’s The Jungle and Harvey Washington Wiley, the famous 19th century chemist who identified poisons in everyday manufactured foods we love to eat. The author also provides intriguing cases of food poisoning scandals by manufactured foods throughout the 19th and early 20th century. For example, in June 1899, the city of Cincinnati had to warn its citizens of an epidemic of stomach problems following the consumption of “embalmed” beef. “More than one thousand people had fallen ill in a single week after eating beef.” The culprit? Two new brand-name preservatives at the time that contained formaldehyde as a main ingredient. (p. 61) Truly a fascinating history! So glad we live in the times that we do! Highly recommended read. :-)"
126,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28745526-allie,4,"I came across this book while at the Boston Science museum and knew I had pick it up. It took me several weeks to get through this book but, I still really enjoyed it. This book basically covers the story of Wiley and his fight for food safety regulations. It also discusses the effect politics can have on regulations and consumer protection as well as the creation of the 1906 Pure Food and Drug Act. It is quite alarming to me how we allow politics to impede the creation of regulations to keep people safe. This book provides examples of times when scientists and researchers were providing data about an adulterant saying, ""this can hurt you"" and industry saying, "" no it's fine"" and then politicians agreeing with industry. While we don't want to hurt business and our economy it is important to keep in mind that generally companies in industry are looking out for their own interest. Also I am so grateful for the safety regulations we have now. We don't have to worry about formalin in milk etc. One of my favorite quotes from this book was from Wiley in regards to the purpose of science which is "" to search for truth and thereby to elevate and improve mankind"". "
127,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63521529-beth-menendez,5,"Solid 4.5 stars. I'm dinging it half a star because it is a scince-y book that can get a little dry at times and I think it may lose some readers because of this. However, for anyone who think that the Whole Foods movement and Clean Eating is a new fad, you are gravely mistaken. Deborah Blum does a fantastic job of making Dr. Harvey Washington Wiley come to life. Dr. Washington was the Chief Chemist in the Department of Chemistry and fought for YEARS trying to get congress to approve bills for the Pure Food and Drug movement. Before this movement it was completely legal to add preservatives to food so that spoiled food could then be served to the masses. Yes. Spoiled food. Since mass refrigeration was not really a thing yet, nor was any kind of safety guidelines for chemicals (whether used in food or drugs) all kinds of sketchy things were going on with food for the masses. Milk a little off? No worries, we'll put formaldehyde in it. Oh, was that cow a bit sick? No worries, we'll use some potassium nitrate (saltpeter) to keep it okay. It does not mater that saltpeter will actually kill you. It's cheaper than sodium chloride (table salt) so it's fine. Seriously. The stuff they put in medicines... eek. Just eek. So how does Dr Wiley come in? He began to protest that what manufacturers put in things was deceiving the populations. That maple syrup is not syrup. It's coal tar derived color agents (seriously) and water with a little sugar. Later with a lot of saccharin in it. Because it's cheaper. There were huge arguments over corn syrup as a cheaper additive to foods than sugar. Wait - aren't we STILL arguing about this. Yes, yes we are. After reading this book I am realizing how much has stayed the same and not changed a bit. Oh the topics might be a little different but the court case involving Coca Cola and their ingredients that were both addicting to people and toxic to them that went round and round could be replaced with the energy drinks of today all over the same chemical - caffeine.  The way that what we eat is literally influenced by who is in the White House was a bit of a shock. Dr. Wiley had harder times certain years simply because the president in office elected secretaries that made Dr. Wiley's job almost impossible. The fact that the main secretary to the USDA over him had ties to manufacturing making his job nearly impossible at the end of his term could have read like it was happening today. Upton Sinclair's book The Jungle was more than just a novel - it was a whistle blowing land mine that showed many what was going on with the ""food"" we eat. Even with that book selling thousands of copies there was much attempt to discredit Sinclair which were eventually successful because Sinclair was a socialist - he just wanted everyone to get a fair (clean healthy) shake. Manufacturers and lobbyists were not about to let this happen and so he became a pariah in Washington.  The one thing that resounded throughout the book is how much we fight over the minutiae until there is a national epidemic sadly has not changed. The 1906 original Pure Foods bill (Dr Wiley's bill) came into effect after many children died from the formaldehyde in the milk after YEARS of dying on the floor of Congress. The 1938 bill that beefed (no pun intended) up the bill came about after many children died from taking cough syrup that had been made with sweetened with diethylene glycol (antifreeze). Similar bills were passed in 1956 and 1971 after injury to women and children. Why do I mention this? Because we are STILL fighting this battle - remember when there was salmonella in the peanut butter? Remember how no one could eat salad last Thanksgiving because of E.Coli? Yes, we are still fighting getting clean, pure food from manufacturers. If that is not scary I cannot think what is. Before we look at the past with rose colored glasses we need to realize that the fight for balance of what is actually good for us and what can be had cheaply is still going on. For this reason alone, I highly recommend this book. "
128,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63970501-maureen-caupp,4,"A very interesting read about the work done at the turn of the twentieth century by the United States Department of Agriculture to determine the contents of food and drinks, the impacts of the added compounds on health, and the continuing battle to regulate harmful additives and require truthful labeling. At the turn of the century food manufactures used dangerous preservatives such as formaldehyde in dairy and meats to cover up already spoiling products. Manufactures also used cheap synthetic dyes and flavorings to cut costs. For example ketchup often didn't have tomatoes and strawberry jam didn't contain strawberries. Instead both were any available food scraps left over (pumpkin rinds, apple cores and skins, etc.) dyed red.This book focuses on the efforts of the chief chemist at the USDA for over 30 years around the turn of the century who worked tirelessly and was a strong advocate for regulation and accurate labeling. It also goes into some of the legal battles involved in regulating additives to food and drink. Just like today whenever any regulating legislation managed to get passed into law manufactures pushed back to weaken the new laws. "

IS A MANIFESTO.I follow the two blogs, Barf Blog and Food Safety News, at work, and when this book was published, both of them published blurbs on it, suggesting it was a good read. My coworker, now my manager, requested the library purchase it, and they did! So she borrowed it and said it was fascinating.Then when it came out in paperback, both blogs again ran blurbs, and I checked it out.I would consider this a must-read book. It details so much about common assumptions of the public, government, and business, and WHY government is absolutely essential to putting roadblocks into the path of capitalism.Some might say that the book bogs down a bit when it details all the different shit (sometimes literally) the Bureau of Chemistry was finding in food products, but it never repeated itself, and it honestly could have gone on forever. The borax, the salicylic acid, the lead, it just never stopped coming. The rise of industrial chemistry, while ultimately a good thing, makes me shiver in fear at what it would have been like to have been alive then.Absolutely loved the epilogue where the author warns against this presidential administration pointing out that it directly mirrors what Harvey Washington Wiley was up against.Those who are not students of history are condemned to repeat the past, indeed."

It is essential to understand that throughout time, industry/corporations in masse have actively fought against protecting individuals if they perceived the requested change would have a negative impact on their profit. These corporations have expended significant revenue to market the political idea of the deregulation of all the things. This book is a great example of why, as a society, there is a necessity for many of the existing regulations. It also does a good job of highlighting corporations and individuals who were open to change and saw the value in a pure food movement and how it could be economically and socially beneficial. Personally, I think I should have read this slower and just read a chapter here and there. To some extent, the chapters and build up were formulaic and came off as a tad dense. This is likely because the majority of the book discussed how a food or beverage was adulterated and the steps taken to stop the incorrect labeling or toxic additives. The adulterations were often similar and the process of fighting the deceptions would be similar, ie. education of the public and the attempt to pass laws to prohibit the additives or mislabeling. Due to the somewhat repetitive nature, I think I would have liked to spread out this book. With that said, I still enjoyed this read and recommend it! If I could I would have given it 3.5 and probably would have been a 4.0 had a read it like I suggested above."

145,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6293008-filippe,5,"“The Shutdown is Bad For Anyone Who Eats Food”, says Stephen Colbert on Friday, January 11. “Don't Panic: The Government Shutdown Isn't Making Food Unsafe”, counters NPR’s Dan Charles on Weekend Update the following morning.It’s 2019, but you’d be forgiven for thinking of pre-1906 America after reading this wonderful account of the U.S. “pure food movement” and its most steadfast defender and all-around gadfly, chemist Harvey W. Wiley, a man I’d heard nothing about before. As in all of her previous books, Blum’s conversational tone belies meticulous research and attention to detail. Each chapter, charmingly epigraphed with a line or verse from a poem by Wiley himself, is filled with quotations from primary sources; ancillary characters are given their due. Decades of political warfare and industry opposition to pure-food-and-drug laws (familiar names such as Monsanto, Dow Chemical, and Coca-Cola all make unflattering appearances) are richly described.The hand-wringing ineffectiveness of early enforcement, endless concessions to regulation-hating manufacturers, conflicts of interest, and downright corruption in the Department of Agriculture and elsewhere are frustrating, unsurprising, and terribly modern, but I sometimes found myself equally exasperated by Wiley’s crusader-style single-mindedness (that word’s in the title for a reason).I do wish the book had focused more on Wiley’s later-life work with Good Housekeeping Laboratories and covered a bit more of the history of the Food and Drug Administration (newly founded at the book’s close and Wiley’s death in 1930). I wish Wiley’s work and that of the pure-food defenders was not still under continuous undermining more than a century later, as the Epilogue notes. And, tangentially, I would love to read a similar biography/history of Frances Oldham Kelsey’s half-century of work at the FDA. What a lovely parallel (or sequel) that would make."

149,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76170804-judy-monchuk,4,"What a fascinating and frightening read. This history of the fight for food safety laws in the United States is a disturbing page-turner that literally kept me up at night because I didn’t want to put it down.As food manufacturers in the late 19th century embraced chemicals as preservatives, sweeteners or colourants to keep food bright and tasty, they were under no obligation to tell customers what was in their milk or meat, coffee or candy. Whiskey might not even be whiskey. Children died after drinking “chemically improved” milk, canned meat sent to soldiers fighting in the Spanish-American war was described as “embalmed beef.” Formaldehyde was used to deal with the sour taste of milk and extend its life, while chalk was added to whiten it. Borax improved the taste of rancid butter, candy was coloured with poisonous dyes that included arsenic or lead. Saccharine (marketed by Monsanto more than a century ago) presented a health risk if consumed in large enough doses, which was likely because it was an unlabelled sweetener in many products: from soft drinks to jam to canned vegetables. There was no requirement for any food to be or even include what it said it was. Spices could be predominantly anything but the pepper or ginger promised on the bottle, which may include burned shells, charcoal and even floor sweepings. Honey was often tinted corn syrup, tea leaves may not be tea and “fraud was not just pervasive; it was standard practice.”Any effort to introduce safety testing or require a breakdown of ingredients was met with sharp resistance from industry, which often received a sympathetic ear in the White House across a handful of administrations. At the dawn of the 20th century, the manufacturer of a formaldehyde-infused preservative called Freezine argued that the public should just embrace whatever chemicals prevented food decay without question, noting “I wish to say that every one of us eats embalmed meat and we know it and we like it.” Weaving all of this together is a biography of chemist Dr. Harvey Wiley, who refused to back down in his quest for consumer protection. Wiley, chief chemist for the US Department of Agriculture, spent decades fighting for regulations, investigation and even basic labelling to inform consumers what was their food or drinks. The Pure Food and Drug Act, passed in 1906, was known to many as “Dr. Wiley’s law” although he is largely a footnote in history today. In his later years, Wiley was bitter about the struggle and the constant pushback from industry for any regulation. Pulitzer Prize-winning science journalist Deborah Blum has done a fabulous job of bringing this era to life and outlining the challenges facing Wiley and others who tried to spotlight the importance of food safety. It’s rare to celebrate the efforts of a civil servant, especially where those who work for the public good are often painted by politicians as an impediment to business, a consideration spelled out in Wiley’s day. It’s also very true in the 21st century, where the current president vowed to eliminate any regulation that kills jobs. The Poison Squad: One Chemist's Single-Minded Crusade for Food Safety at the Turn of the Twentieth Century is a first-rate thriller. 4.5 stars."
150,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72623806-nicholle,5,"I give this book 5 stars (out of 5). I loved the science/chemistry and history behind the story. The author is an excellent science writer and wrote such an intriguing story. The parts where she described the politics behind the story were boring to me (I cannot stand politics), but a necessary evil in order to describe how the story played out. This story is about chemist Dr. Harvey Washington Wiley and how he wanted to make sure that all food was safe, or at least labeled, from adulterants. Such adulterants were arsenic, dyes from coal tar, and boric acid (or borax), just to name a few. He was truly a man ahead of his time because during a time where most individuals (and even companies) were ignorant of science and most companies producing food only cared about making a profit, he strove to make sure food was safe from unnecessary additives (or adulterants) by actually testing the additives to prove that they were in fact harmful to people.Dr. Wiley set up experiments to feed a group of individuals adulterants, such as boric acid, by comparing that group against a control group not being fed adulterants. The data he and his team of chemists generated was not only rigorous and scientific, but also proved his hypothesis that the adulterants being added to food were in fact harmful to people. Taking this data a step further, he extrapolated that if these adulterants were harmful to healthy (male) adults, these adulterants were even more harmful to babies, children, and the elderly. Dr. Wiley fought almost his whole career against the politics of the unscrupulous lobby behind the companies making the adulterated foods. What I found so fascinating was that among the few companies that did mass produce food without adulterants was the company that made Heinz ketchup. The owner behind the ketchup not only wanted to make food without adulterants, but he also wanted to prove that making unadulterated food could be profitable, since that was the main argument behind the companies that adulterated food was that they could not be profitable. What I truly loved about Dr. Wiley was his desire to speak up about the chemistry behind the adulterants, without dumbing it down, to women. He wrote countless articles in magazines and publications geared towards women. He knew that getting women (who make up 50% of the population) on board with his cause would only further his fight in the political arena to achieve his goals. Dr. Wiley even married a suffragist and supported her desire to be jailed for her fight for women to vote.Another aspect I found so fascinating about this book is the role the government needs to play to protect the average American, or consumer, from unregulated business that cares more about profit than the health of the consumer by taking shortcuts. While I read this book the government shut down was occurring. And it also seems the trend in the current administration is to cozy up to big business that may or may not care about the average American consumer in their bottom line. Only time will tell if this is occurring, and unfortunately as history does repeat itself, who (and how many) will have to get sick and or die before government steps in to protect the average American consumer?

151,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56837139-brandon-polzin,3,"This book was an enjoyable narrative about a story that I never thought I would be interested in. The topic of food safety is a vitally important one, and I am grateful that a person like Harvey Washington Wiley had a lifelong goal of supporting food transparency for the benefit of the United States' citizens. I am a sucker for the time period in American History that a large portion of this book is set in, as Theodore Roosevelt is one of my favorite historical figures. He is painted as a protagonist in most of the other books that I've read, so it was amusing to see him portrayed in an antagonistic light here.All that being said, I felt this book had a few shortcomings. I may be spoiled after reading biographical narratives by Siddharta Mukherjee and Edmund Morris, but I felt illustrative descriptions of characters and settings were lacking in this book. I certainly was never bored, but it lacked the fiction-like and seemingly whimsical appeal of other critically acclaimed nonfiction narratives. It may be, though, that the nature of this story was not as exciting as those I am comparing it to, so I don't want to place the blame solely on Blum's shoulders.Another issue I had was the intermittent lack of focus/mislabeling of the book. The subtitle of the book (""One Chemist's...) implies that it is a biography about one man, that man being the aforementioned Wiley. Blum went into great detail about him, but would then move on to other parallel stories that coincided with the progression of food safety within the United States. This was obviously all relevant to the overarching story the book was trying to tell, but because of the excessive breaks from Wiley I felt this book should have been explicitly marketed as a story of food safety as a whole, not JUST as a narrative about Wiley. It's a nitpicky criticism, but I found myself being taken out of the story and thinking about it as I read the book.All in all though, I would recommend this book. I love that there was a ""cast of characters"" in the beginning to reference to whenever I forgot about a person's name or their significance. I also loved they way Blum used the story of food safety in the USA to emphasize the control that big business has over the way consumers act and think as a whole, and the importance of a dissenting opinion when everyone is all too eager to comply.I would rate this book a 3.5 if I could, but I'll round up because I'm feeling nice. I hope you can get your hands on a copy sometime soon!"
152,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1468458-lisa,4,"So why do they bleach flour? Read this and you will find out and probably never buy bleached flour again. Having worked in QA in the pharmaceutical industry, I was familiar with the Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906 as the beginning of the regulation of pharmaceuticals, but hadn't really known that its major impetus was on food and I had never heard of the man who had such a big part of making it law, Dr. Harvey Washington Wiley. It was not just unclean production practices that put the food supply at risk of contamination. The dangers included what was purposefully added like heavy metal and coal tar food dyes, especially in candy; formaldehyde in meat and milk; preservatives that had never been tested for safety of human consumption; sugar replacements that had no caloric value; and other fillers added just to improve the profit margin. Some of these additives were even marketed to grocers and food producers solely based on their ability to be undetected and increase profitability by dilution of the actual food product or by masking spoilage. People were literally being killed by the food they ate. The book details just how adulterated our food supply was prior to this act, how much industry worked to keep it that way, how much politicians were unconcerned about the health and welfare of the common person, and how hard Dr. Wiley had to work to protect consumers. Some things never really change and the parallels to our modern world are easy to see. Industry does not, never has, and never will self-regulate if it means less profitability. There were some good guy manufacturers who were promoting pure food, such as H.J. Heinz Company, but they were the rare exception. Some of these same companies that were willingly putting our health at risk over 100 years ago are still in business: Armour, Swift, Coca-cola, Monsanto, McCormick. Despite the debt we owe him and his Poison Squad volunteers, they and Dr. Wiley have mostly been forgotten today. This book attempts to correct that. I fully appreciated the inclusion of historic photos, political cartoons, and food ads. It was especially gratifying to see the woman working in the chemistry lab in the early 1900's. Deborah Blum also includes Dr. Wiley's wife, Anna Kelton Wiley, who was one of the suffragists jailed by President Wilson. Are these hints at a future book on the womens' suffrage movement? I could completely see how this book could be born out of the research from ""The Poisoner's Handbook"" due to the pure whiskey issue. "
153,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71163840-steven-meyers,5,"If you are under the impression that food was awesome back in the “good ole days,” then, man oh man, Ms. Blum’s book will relieve you of that misconception. ‘The Poison Squad’ shows how business greed and political chicanery worked hand-in-hand to place private interests over consumer safety. As the author states, “Fraud was not just pervasive, it was standard practice.” The decades-long fight over supplying consumers with information about what is in their food and the toxic dangers in it was enlightening but discouraging to read. Ms. Blum is a highly respected author who has written numerous books in the field of science. Her writing style is direct and easy to understand. The years covered are from 1844 through 1938. Buckle up, you’re in for a illuminating scary ride. During the mid-1800s, manufacturers and food processors discovered certain inexpensive chemicals could imitate foods and hide unhealthy diseased meats or other perishable products. Factory environments were hellholes, riddled with unsafe and unclean practices. Into this business atmosphere came Harvey Washington Wiley, a government chemist, who began experiments on the quality of foods, exposed business deceptions, and made the public aware of what their families were eating and drinking. Needless to say, company feces hit the fan big time. While Ms. Blum does center the book on Mr. Wiley’s actions, a plethora of other food safety advocates and detractors are also explained. During his three decades crusading against business chicanery he became a very popular and widely loved individual by the general public. Politicians and businessmen, however, would have liked nothing better than for Mr. Wiley to wind up in a can of corned beef or be fired. I never heard of the guy until I picked up ‘The Poison Squad.’ ‘The Poison Squad’ shows that there were responsible high-minded corporations such as Heinz who practiced and advocated for safe foods and there were plenty of nasty ones such as Monsanto who aggressively fought to allow their “additives” to remain in the market. The way companies acted about possibly having to supply consumers with ingredient information so they could make more informed choices, you’d think it was the next thing to Armageddon. It would be naïve to believe that those awful days are completely gone and corporations now place consumer safety over greed. Sure, like yesteryear, there are businesses that are good corporate stewards but like the old Russian proverb we should, “Trust but verify” before embracing a business’s assertions, especially when it comes to consumer safety. Greed has not somehow magically disappeared. In the author’s epilogue she states, “The story of consumer protection in the United States is often to story of a country playing defense, an account of government regulators waking up, time and time again, to yet another public health crisis.” In other words, once a sizable number of consumers bite the dust and it gets enough press exposure, then politicians and government act. Compared to the time period covered in the book, food safety has greatly improved. However, many businesses still focus on profit over public welfare is still very much with us. Ms. Blum has, yet again, written another highly informative work. Read it and weep."
154,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2125854-becca-younk,3,"I loved The Poisoner's Handbook, so of course I had to read this when I spied it on display at the library. It's not quite as good, but still a compelling and interesting read. It's a bit scary to think about all the ingredients listed on labels that I wouldn't even be able to guess what they are, but at least they're listed! I can google them if I'm so inclined. Whereas previously, food manufacturers could just throw in basically whatever they wanted. The book follows Dr. Wiley at the Agriculture Department as he conducts studies in an effort to pass a Pure Food law. Dr. Wiley sounds great, he ends up marrying a suffragette, which is cool. I think where this book sort of falls flat is all the emphasis on the trials and the inner workings of the Department and politicians. It's interesting for awhile, and then gets a bit tedious and feels a little too much like office drama. While The Poisoner's Handbook gives specific examples of how poisons killed people, this book tends to just list deaths or illnesses as numbers. ""100 children died from such-and-such in Indiana"" type of thing, without going into detail. Food safety isn't as shocking as poisons, sure, but I wish there were more human impact stories. ""Cure-all"" medications are briefly mentioned, and it makes me wonder if Blum will write an entire book on those. Crossing my fingers she does, because that would be fascinating. Twice in the book Blum writes Midland, Michigan, as Midlands, Michigan. Once I can believe is a typo. But twice? It takes two seconds of googling to find that the headquarters of Dow is in Midland, no 's.' I find I'm very annoyed by the lack of caring to get a city name correct. Is publishing in such a bad state that there are no editors?"
155,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4454466-amy,5,"Firstly, I think there should be a law enacted declaring that Deborah Blum must author all history/non-fiction books for popular culture. She has an incredible talent for writing history and, in particular, making the areas of scientific history unbelievably exciting!After thoroughly enjoying her other book, The Poisoner’s Handbook, several years back, I was eager to pick up another one by her. The Poison Squad explores the unique history of food safety laws in the U.S. and the influence of historical figures on the creation of the Food Safety and Drug Administration — specifically Upton Sinclair’s The Jungle and Harvey Washington Wiley, the famous 19th century chemist who identified poisons in everyday manufactured foods we love to eat. The author also provides intriguing cases of food poisoning scandals by manufactured foods throughout the 19th and early 20th century. For example, in June 1899, the city of Cincinnati had to warn its citizens of an epidemic of stomach problems following the consumption of “embalmed” beef. “More than one thousand people had fallen ill in a single week after eating beef.” The culprit? Two new brand-name preservatives at the time that contained formaldehyde as a main ingredient. (p. 61) Truly a fascinating history! So glad we live in the times that we do! Highly recommended read. :-)"
156,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28745526-allie,4,"I came across this book while at the Boston Science museum and knew I had pick it up. It took me several weeks to get through this book but, I still really enjoyed it. This book basically covers the story of Wiley and his fight for food safety regulations. It also discusses the effect politics can have on regulations and consumer protection as well as the creation of the 1906 Pure Food and Drug Act. It is quite alarming to me how we allow politics to impede the creation of regulations to keep people safe. This book provides examples of times when scientists and researchers were providing data about an adulterant saying, ""this can hurt you"" and industry saying, "" no it's fine"" and then politicians agreeing with industry. While we don't want to hurt business and our economy it is important to keep in mind that generally companies in industry are looking out for their own interest. Also I am so grateful for the safety regulations we have now. We don't have to worry about formalin in milk etc. One of my favorite quotes from this book was from Wiley in regards to the purpose of science which is "" to search for truth and thereby to elevate and improve mankind"". "
157,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63521529-beth-menendez,5,"Solid 4.5 stars. I'm dinging it half a star because it is a scince-y book that can get a little dry at times and I think it may lose some readers because of this. However, for anyone who think that the Whole Foods movement and Clean Eating is a new fad, you are gravely mistaken. Deborah Blum does a fantastic job of making Dr. Harvey Washington Wiley come to life. Dr. Washington was the Chief Chemist in the Department of Chemistry and fought for YEARS trying to get congress to approve bills for the Pure Food and Drug movement. Before this movement it was completely legal to add preservatives to food so that spoiled food could then be served to the masses. Yes. Spoiled food. Since mass refrigeration was not really a thing yet, nor was any kind of safety guidelines for chemicals (whether used in food or drugs) all kinds of sketchy things were going on with food for the masses. Milk a little off? No worries, we'll put formaldehyde in it. Oh, was that cow a bit sick? No worries, we'll use some potassium nitrate (saltpeter) to keep it okay. It does not mater that saltpeter will actually kill you. It's cheaper than sodium chloride (table salt) so it's fine. Seriously. The stuff they put in medicines... eek. Just eek. So how does Dr Wiley come in? He began to protest that what manufacturers put in things was deceiving the populations. That maple syrup is not syrup. It's coal tar derived color agents (seriously) and water with a little sugar. Later with a lot of saccharin in it. Because it's cheaper. There were huge arguments over corn syrup as a cheaper additive to foods than sugar. Wait - aren't we STILL arguing about this. Yes, yes we are. After reading this book I am realizing how much has stayed the same and not changed a bit. Oh the topics might be a little different but the court case involving Coca Cola and their ingredients that were both addicting to people and toxic to them that went round and round could be replaced with the energy drinks of today all over the same chemical - caffeine.  The way that what we eat is literally influenced by who is in the White House was a bit of a shock. Dr. Wiley had harder times certain years simply because the president in office elected secretaries that made Dr. Wiley's job almost impossible. The fact that the main secretary to the USDA over him had ties to manufacturing making his job nearly impossible at the end of his term could have read like it was happening today. Upton Sinclair's book The Jungle was more than just a novel - it was a whistle blowing land mine that showed many what was going on with the ""food"" we eat. Even with that book selling thousands of copies there was much attempt to discredit Sinclair which were eventually successful because Sinclair was a socialist - he just wanted everyone to get a fair (clean healthy) shake. Manufacturers and lobbyists were not about to let this happen and so he became a pariah in Washington.  The one thing that resounded throughout the book is how much we fight over the minutiae until there is a national epidemic sadly has not changed. The 1906 original Pure Foods bill (Dr Wiley's bill) came into effect after many children died from the formaldehyde in the milk after YEARS of dying on the floor of Congress. The 1938 bill that beefed (no pun intended) up the bill came about after many children died from taking cough syrup that had been made with sweetened with diethylene glycol (antifreeze). Similar bills were passed in 1956 and 1971 after injury to women and children. Why do I mention this? Because we are STILL fighting this battle - remember when there was salmonella in the peanut butter? Remember how no one could eat salad last Thanksgiving because of E.Coli? Yes, we are still fighting getting clean, pure food from manufacturers. If that is not scary I cannot think what is. Before we look at the past with rose colored glasses we need to realize that the fight for balance of what is actually good for us and what can be had cheaply is still going on. For this reason alone, I highly recommend this book. "
158,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63970501-maureen-caupp,4,"A very interesting read about the work done at the turn of the twentieth century by the United States Department of Agriculture to determine the contents of food and drinks, the impacts of the added compounds on health, and the continuing battle to regulate harmful additives and require truthful labeling. At the turn of the century food manufactures used dangerous preservatives such as formaldehyde in dairy and meats to cover up already spoiling products. Manufactures also used cheap synthetic dyes and flavorings to cut costs. For example ketchup often didn't have tomatoes and strawberry jam didn't contain strawberries. Instead both were any available food scraps left over (pumpkin rinds, apple cores and skins, etc.) dyed red.This book focuses on the efforts of the chief chemist at the USDA for over 30 years around the turn of the century who worked tirelessly and was a strong advocate for regulation and accurate labeling. It also goes into some of the legal battles involved in regulating additives to food and drink. Just like today whenever any regulating legislation managed to get passed into law manufactures pushed back to weaken the new laws. "

IS A MANIFESTO.I follow the two blogs, Barf Blog and Food Safety News, at work, and when this book was published, both of them published blurbs on it, suggesting it was a good read. My coworker, now my manager, requested the library purchase it, and they did! So she borrowed it and said it was fascinating.Then when it came out in paperback, both blogs again ran blurbs, and I checked it out.I would consider this a must-read book. It details so much about common assumptions of the public, government, and business, and WHY government is absolutely essential to putting roadblocks into the path of capitalism.Some might say that the book bogs down a bit when it details all the different shit (sometimes literally) the Bureau of Chemistry was finding in food products, but it never repeated itself, and it honestly could have gone on forever. The borax, the salicylic acid, the lead, it just never stopped coming. The rise of industrial chemistry, while ultimately a good thing, makes me shiver in fear at what it would have been like to have been alive then.Absolutely loved the epilogue where the author warns against this presidential administration pointing out that it directly mirrors what Harvey Washington Wiley was up against.Those who are not students of history are condemned to repeat the past, indeed."

It is essential to understand that throughout time, industry/corporations in masse have actively fought against protecting individuals if they perceived the requested change would have a negative impact on their profit. These corporations have expended significant revenue to market the political idea of the deregulation of all the things. This book is a great example of why, as a society, there is a necessity for many of the existing regulations. It also does a good job of highlighting corporations and individuals who were open to change and saw the value in a pure food movement and how it could be economically and socially beneficial. Personally, I think I should have read this slower and just read a chapter here and there. To some extent, the chapters and build up were formulaic and came off as a tad dense. This is likely because the majority of the book discussed how a food or beverage was adulterated and the steps taken to stop the incorrect labeling or toxic additives. The adulterations were often similar and the process of fighting the deceptions would be similar, ie. education of the public and the attempt to pass laws to prohibit the additives or mislabeling. Due to the somewhat repetitive nature, I think I would have liked to spread out this book. With that said, I still enjoyed this read and recommend it! If I could I would have given it 3.5 and probably would have been a 4.0 had a read it like I suggested above."

175,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6293008-filippe,5,"“The Shutdown is Bad For Anyone Who Eats Food”, says Stephen Colbert on Friday, January 11. “Don't Panic: The Government Shutdown Isn't Making Food Unsafe”, counters NPR’s Dan Charles on Weekend Update the following morning.It’s 2019, but you’d be forgiven for thinking of pre-1906 America after reading this wonderful account of the U.S. “pure food movement” and its most steadfast defender and all-around gadfly, chemist Harvey W. Wiley, a man I’d heard nothing about before. As in all of her previous books, Blum’s conversational tone belies meticulous research and attention to detail. Each chapter, charmingly epigraphed with a line or verse from a poem by Wiley himself, is filled with quotations from primary sources; ancillary characters are given their due. Decades of political warfare and industry opposition to pure-food-and-drug laws (familiar names such as Monsanto, Dow Chemical, and Coca-Cola all make unflattering appearances) are richly described.The hand-wringing ineffectiveness of early enforcement, endless concessions to regulation-hating manufacturers, conflicts of interest, and downright corruption in the Department of Agriculture and elsewhere are frustrating, unsurprising, and terribly modern, but I sometimes found myself equally exasperated by Wiley’s crusader-style single-mindedness (that word’s in the title for a reason).I do wish the book had focused more on Wiley’s later-life work with Good Housekeeping Laboratories and covered a bit more of the history of the Food and Drug Administration (newly founded at the book’s close and Wiley’s death in 1930). I wish Wiley’s work and that of the pure-food defenders was not still under continuous undermining more than a century later, as the Epilogue notes. And, tangentially, I would love to read a similar biography/history of Frances Oldham Kelsey’s half-century of work at the FDA. What a lovely parallel (or sequel) that would make."

179,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76170804-judy-monchuk,4,"What a fascinating and frightening read. This history of the fight for food safety laws in the United States is a disturbing page-turner that literally kept me up at night because I didn’t want to put it down.As food manufacturers in the late 19th century embraced chemicals as preservatives, sweeteners or colourants to keep food bright and tasty, they were under no obligation to tell customers what was in their milk or meat, coffee or candy. Whiskey might not even be whiskey. Children died after drinking “chemically improved” milk, canned meat sent to soldiers fighting in the Spanish-American war was described as “embalmed beef.” Formaldehyde was used to deal with the sour taste of milk and extend its life, while chalk was added to whiten it. Borax improved the taste of rancid butter, candy was coloured with poisonous dyes that included arsenic or lead. Saccharine (marketed by Monsanto more than a century ago) presented a health risk if consumed in large enough doses, which was likely because it was an unlabelled sweetener in many products: from soft drinks to jam to canned vegetables. There was no requirement for any food to be or even include what it said it was. Spices could be predominantly anything but the pepper or ginger promised on the bottle, which may include burned shells, charcoal and even floor sweepings. Honey was often tinted corn syrup, tea leaves may not be tea and “fraud was not just pervasive; it was standard practice.”Any effort to introduce safety testing or require a breakdown of ingredients was met with sharp resistance from industry, which often received a sympathetic ear in the White House across a handful of administrations. At the dawn of the 20th century, the manufacturer of a formaldehyde-infused preservative called Freezine argued that the public should just embrace whatever chemicals prevented food decay without question, noting “I wish to say that every one of us eats embalmed meat and we know it and we like it.” Weaving all of this together is a biography of chemist Dr. Harvey Wiley, who refused to back down in his quest for consumer protection. Wiley, chief chemist for the US Department of Agriculture, spent decades fighting for regulations, investigation and even basic labelling to inform consumers what was their food or drinks. The Pure Food and Drug Act, passed in 1906, was known to many as “Dr. Wiley’s law” although he is largely a footnote in history today. In his later years, Wiley was bitter about the struggle and the constant pushback from industry for any regulation. Pulitzer Prize-winning science journalist Deborah Blum has done a fabulous job of bringing this era to life and outlining the challenges facing Wiley and others who tried to spotlight the importance of food safety. It’s rare to celebrate the efforts of a civil servant, especially where those who work for the public good are often painted by politicians as an impediment to business, a consideration spelled out in Wiley’s day. It’s also very true in the 21st century, where the current president vowed to eliminate any regulation that kills jobs. The Poison Squad: One Chemist's Single-Minded Crusade for Food Safety at the Turn of the Twentieth Century is a first-rate thriller. 4.5 stars."
180,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72623806-nicholle,5,"I give this book 5 stars (out of 5). I loved the science/chemistry and history behind the story. The author is an excellent science writer and wrote such an intriguing story. The parts where she described the politics behind the story were boring to me (I cannot stand politics), but a necessary evil in order to describe how the story played out. This story is about chemist Dr. Harvey Washington Wiley and how he wanted to make sure that all food was safe, or at least labeled, from adulterants. Such adulterants were arsenic, dyes from coal tar, and boric acid (or borax), just to name a few. He was truly a man ahead of his time because during a time where most individuals (and even companies) were ignorant of science and most companies producing food only cared about making a profit, he strove to make sure food was safe from unnecessary additives (or adulterants) by actually testing the additives to prove that they were in fact harmful to people.Dr. Wiley set up experiments to feed a group of individuals adulterants, such as boric acid, by comparing that group against a control group not being fed adulterants. The data he and his team of chemists generated was not only rigorous and scientific, but also proved his hypothesis that the adulterants being added to food were in fact harmful to people. Taking this data a step further, he extrapolated that if these adulterants were harmful to healthy (male) adults, these adulterants were even more harmful to babies, children, and the elderly. Dr. Wiley fought almost his whole career against the politics of the unscrupulous lobby behind the companies making the adulterated foods. What I found so fascinating was that among the few companies that did mass produce food without adulterants was the company that made Heinz ketchup. The owner behind the ketchup not only wanted to make food without adulterants, but he also wanted to prove that making unadulterated food could be profitable, since that was the main argument behind the companies that adulterated food was that they could not be profitable. What I truly loved about Dr. Wiley was his desire to speak up about the chemistry behind the adulterants, without dumbing it down, to women. He wrote countless articles in magazines and publications geared towards women. He knew that getting women (who make up 50% of the population) on board with his cause would only further his fight in the political arena to achieve his goals. Dr. Wiley even married a suffragist and supported her desire to be jailed for her fight for women to vote.Another aspect I found so fascinating about this book is the role the government needs to play to protect the average American, or consumer, from unregulated business that cares more about profit than the health of the consumer by taking shortcuts. While I read this book the government shut down was occurring. And it also seems the trend in the current administration is to cozy up to big business that may or may not care about the average American consumer in their bottom line. Only time will tell if this is occurring, and unfortunately as history does repeat itself, who (and how many) will have to get sick and or die before government steps in to protect the average American consumer? "
181,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56837139-brandon-polzin,3,"This book was an enjoyable narrative about a story that I never thought I would be interested in. The topic of food safety is a vitally important one, and I am grateful that a person like Harvey Washington Wiley had a lifelong goal of supporting food transparency for the benefit of the United States' citizens. I am a sucker for the time period in American History that a large portion of this book is set in, as Theodore Roosevelt is one of my favorite historical figures. He is painted as a protagonist in most of the other books that I've read, so it was amusing to see him portrayed in an antagonistic light here.All that being said, I felt this book had a few shortcomings. I may be spoiled after reading biographical narratives by Siddharta Mukherjee and Edmund Morris, but I felt illustrative descriptions of characters and settings were lacking in this book. I certainly was never bored, but it lacked the fiction-like and seemingly whimsical appeal of other critically acclaimed nonfiction narratives. It may be, though, that the nature of this story was not as exciting as those I am comparing it to, so I don't want to place the blame solely on Blum's shoulders.Another issue I had was the intermittent lack of focus/mislabeling of the book. The subtitle of the book (""One Chemist's...) implies that it is a biography about one man, that man being the aforementioned Wiley. Blum went into great detail about him, but would then move on to other parallel stories that coincided with the progression of food safety within the United States. This was obviously all relevant to the overarching story the book was trying to tell, but because of the excessive breaks from Wiley I felt this book should have been explicitly marketed as a story of food safety as a whole, not JUST as a narrative about Wiley. It's a nitpicky criticism, but I found myself being taken out of the story and thinking about it as I read the book.All in all though, I would recommend this book. I love that there was a ""cast of characters"" in the beginning to reference to whenever I forgot about a person's name or their significance. I also loved they way Blum used the story of food safety in the USA to emphasize the control that big business has over the way consumers act and think as a whole, and the importance of a dissenting opinion when everyone is all too eager to comply.I would rate this book a 3.5 if I could, but I'll round up because I'm feeling nice. I hope you can get your hands on a copy sometime soon!"
182,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1468458-lisa,4,"So why do they bleach flour? Read this and you will find out and probably never buy bleached flour again. Having worked in QA in the pharmaceutical industry, I was familiar with the Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906 as the beginning of the regulation of pharmaceuticals, but hadn't really known that its major impetus was on food and I had never heard of the man who had such a big part of making it law, Dr. Harvey Washington Wiley. It was not just unclean production practices that put the food supply at risk of contamination. The dangers included what was purposefully added like heavy metal and coal tar food dyes, especially in candy; formaldehyde in meat and milk; preservatives that had never been tested for safety of human consumption; sugar replacements that had no caloric value; and other fillers added just to improve the profit margin. Some of these additives were even marketed to grocers and food producers solely based on their ability to be undetected and increase profitability by dilution of the actual food product or by masking spoilage. People were literally being killed by the food they ate. The book details just how adulterated our food supply was prior to this act, how much industry worked to keep it that way, how much politicians were unconcerned about the health and welfare of the common person, and how hard Dr. Wiley had to work to protect consumers. Some things never really change and the parallels to our modern world are easy to see. Industry does not, never has, and never will self-regulate if it means less profitability. There were some good guy manufacturers who were promoting pure food, such as H.J. Heinz Company, but they were the rare exception. Some of these same companies that were willingly putting our health at risk over 100 years ago are still in business: Armour, Swift, Coca-cola, Monsanto, McCormick. Despite the debt we owe him and his Poison Squad volunteers, they and Dr. Wiley have mostly been forgotten today. This book attempts to correct that. I fully appreciated the inclusion of historic photos, political cartoons, and food ads. It was especially gratifying to see the woman working in the chemistry lab in the early 1900's. Deborah Blum also includes Dr. Wiley's wife, Anna Kelton Wiley, who was one of the suffragists jailed by President Wilson. Are these hints at a future book on the womens' suffrage movement? I could completely see how this book could be born out of the research from ""The Poisoner's Handbook"" due to the pure whiskey issue. "
183,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71163840-steven-meyers,5,"If you are under the impression that food was awesome back in the “good ole days,” then, man oh man, Ms. Blum’s book will relieve you of that misconception. ‘The Poison Squad’ shows how business greed and political chicanery worked hand-in-hand to place private interests over consumer safety. As the author states, “Fraud was not just pervasive, it was standard practice.” The decades-long fight over supplying consumers with information about what is in their food and the toxic dangers in it was enlightening but discouraging to read. Ms. Blum is a highly respected author who has written numerous books in the field of science. Her writing style is direct and easy to understand. The years covered are from 1844 through 1938. Buckle up, you’re in for a illuminating scary ride. During the mid-1800s, manufacturers and food processors discovered certain inexpensive chemicals could imitate foods and hide unhealthy diseased meats or other perishable products. Factory environments were hellholes, riddled with unsafe and unclean practices. Into this business atmosphere came Harvey Washington Wiley, a government chemist, who began experiments on the quality of foods, exposed business deceptions, and made the public aware of what their families were eating and drinking. Needless to say, company feces hit the fan big time. While Ms. Blum does center the book on Mr. Wiley’s actions, a plethora of other food safety advocates and detractors are also explained. During his three decades crusading against business chicanery he became a very popular and widely loved individual by the general public. Politicians and businessmen, however, would have liked nothing better than for Mr. Wiley to wind up in a can of corned beef or be fired. I never heard of the guy until I picked up ‘The Poison Squad.’ ‘The Poison Squad’ shows that there were responsible high-minded corporations such as Heinz who practiced and advocated for safe foods and there were plenty of nasty ones such as Monsanto who aggressively fought to allow their “additives” to remain in the market. The way companies acted about possibly having to supply consumers with ingredient information so they could make more informed choices, you’d think it was the next thing to Armageddon. It would be naïve to believe that those awful days are completely gone and corporations now place consumer safety over greed. Sure, like yesteryear, there are businesses that are good corporate stewards but like the old Russian proverb we should, “Trust but verify” before embracing a business’s assertions, especially when it comes to consumer safety. Greed has not somehow magically disappeared. In the author’s epilogue she states, “The story of consumer protection in the United States is often to story of a country playing defense, an account of government regulators waking up, time and time again, to yet another public health crisis.” In other words, once a sizable number of consumers bite the dust and it gets enough press exposure, then politicians and government act. Compared to the time period covered in the book, food safety has greatly improved. However, many businesses still focus on profit over public welfare is still very much with us. Ms. Blum has, yet again, written another highly informative work. Read it and weep."
184,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2125854-becca-younk,3,"I loved The Poisoner's Handbook, so of course I had to read this when I spied it on display at the library. It's not quite as good, but still a compelling and interesting read. It's a bit scary to think about all the ingredients listed on labels that I wouldn't even be able to guess what they are, but at least they're listed! I can google them if I'm so inclined. Whereas previously, food manufacturers could just throw in basically whatever they wanted. The book follows Dr. Wiley at the Agriculture Department as he conducts studies in an effort to pass a Pure Food law. Dr. Wiley sounds great, he ends up marrying a suffragette, which is cool. I think where this book sort of falls flat is all the emphasis on the trials and the inner workings of the Department and politicians. It's interesting for awhile, and then gets a bit tedious and feels a little too much like office drama. While The Poisoner's Handbook gives specific examples of how poisons killed people, this book tends to just list deaths or illnesses as numbers. ""100 children died from such-and-such in Indiana"" type of thing, without going into detail. Food safety isn't as shocking as poisons, sure, but I wish there were more human impact stories. ""Cure-all"" medications are briefly mentioned, and it makes me wonder if Blum will write an entire book on those. Crossing my fingers she does, because that would be fascinating. Twice in the book Blum writes Midland, Michigan, as Midlands, Michigan. Once I can believe is a typo. But twice? It takes two seconds of googling to find that the headquarters of Dow is in Midland, no 's.' I find I'm very annoyed by the lack of caring to get a city name correct. Is publishing in such a bad state that there are no editors?"
185,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4454466-amy,5,"Firstly, I think there should be a law enacted declaring that Deborah Blum must author all history/non-fiction books for popular culture. She has an incredible talent for writing history and, in particular, making the areas of scientific history unbelievably exciting!After thoroughly enjoying her other book, The Poisoner’s Handbook, several years back, I was eager to pick up another one by her. The Poison Squad explores the unique history of food safety laws in the U.S. and the influence of historical figures on the creation of the Food Safety and Drug Administration — specifically Upton Sinclair’s The Jungle and Harvey Washington Wiley, the famous 19th century chemist who identified poisons in everyday manufactured foods we love to eat. The author also provides intriguing cases of food poisoning scandals by manufactured foods throughout the 19th and early 20th century. For example, in June 1899, the city of Cincinnati had to warn its citizens of an epidemic of stomach problems following the consumption of “embalmed” beef. “More than one thousand people had fallen ill in a single week after eating beef.” The culprit? Two new brand-name preservatives at the time that contained formaldehyde as a main ingredient. (p. 61) Truly a fascinating history! So glad we live in the times that we do! Highly recommended read. :-)"
186,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28745526-allie,4,"I came across this book while at the Boston Science museum and knew I had pick it up. It took me several weeks to get through this book but, I still really enjoyed it. This book basically covers the story of Wiley and his fight for food safety regulations. It also discusses the effect politics can have on regulations and consumer protection as well as the creation of the 1906 Pure Food and Drug Act. It is quite alarming to me how we allow politics to impede the creation of regulations to keep people safe. This book provides examples of times when scientists and researchers were providing data about an adulterant saying, ""this can hurt you"" and industry saying, "" no it's fine"" and then politicians agreeing with industry. While we don't want to hurt business and our economy it is important to keep in mind that generally companies in industry are looking out for their own interest. Also I am so grateful for the safety regulations we have now. We don't have to worry about formalin in milk etc. One of my favorite quotes from this book was from Wiley in regards to the purpose of science which is "" to search for truth and thereby to elevate and improve mankind"". "
187,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63521529-beth-menendez,5,"Solid 4.5 stars. I'm dinging it half a star because it is a scince-y book that can get a little dry at times and I think it may lose some readers because of this. However, for anyone who think that the Whole Foods movement and Clean Eating is a new fad, you are gravely mistaken. Deborah Blum does a fantastic job of making Dr. Harvey Washington Wiley come to life. Dr. Washington was the Chief Chemist in the Department of Chemistry and fought for YEARS trying to get congress to approve bills for the Pure Food and Drug movement. Before this movement it was completely legal to add preservatives to food so that spoiled food could then be served to the masses. Yes. Spoiled food. Since mass refrigeration was not really a thing yet, nor was any kind of safety guidelines for chemicals (whether used in food or drugs) all kinds of sketchy things were going on with food for the masses. Milk a little off? No worries, we'll put formaldehyde in it. Oh, was that cow a bit sick? No worries, we'll use some potassium nitrate (saltpeter) to keep it okay. It does not mater that saltpeter will actually kill you. It's cheaper than sodium chloride (table salt) so it's fine. Seriously. The stuff they put in medicines... eek. Just eek. So how does Dr Wiley come in? He began to protest that what manufacturers put in things was deceiving the populations. That maple syrup is not syrup. It's coal tar derived color agents (seriously) and water with a little sugar. Later with a lot of saccharin in it. Because it's cheaper. There were huge arguments over corn syrup as a cheaper additive to foods than sugar. Wait - aren't we STILL arguing about this. Yes, yes we are. After reading this book I am realizing how much has stayed the same and not changed a bit. Oh the topics might be a little different but the court case involving Coca Cola and their ingredients that were both addicting to people and toxic to them that went round and round could be replaced with the energy drinks of today all over the same chemical - caffeine.  The way that what we eat is literally influenced by who is in the White House was a bit of a shock. Dr. Wiley had harder times certain years simply because the president in office elected secretaries that made Dr. Wiley's job almost impossible. The fact that the main secretary to the USDA over him had ties to manufacturing making his job nearly impossible at the end of his term could have read like it was happening today. Upton Sinclair's book The Jungle was more than just a novel - it was a whistle blowing land mine that showed many what was going on with the ""food"" we eat. Even with that book selling thousands of copies there was much attempt to discredit Sinclair which were eventually successful because Sinclair was a socialist - he just wanted everyone to get a fair (clean healthy) shake. Manufacturers and lobbyists were not about to let this happen and so he became a pariah in Washington.  The one thing that resounded throughout the book is how much we fight over the minutiae until there is a national epidemic sadly has not changed. The 1906 original Pure Foods bill (Dr Wiley's bill) came into effect after many children died from the formaldehyde in the milk after YEARS of dying on the floor of Congress. The 1938 bill that beefed (no pun intended) up the bill came about after many children died from taking cough syrup that had been made with sweetened with diethylene glycol (antifreeze). Similar bills were passed in 1956 and 1971 after injury to women and children. Why do I mention this? Because we are STILL fighting this battle - remember when there was salmonella in the peanut butter? Remember how no one could eat salad last Thanksgiving because of E.Coli? Yes, we are still fighting getting clean, pure food from manufacturers. If that is not scary I cannot think what is. Before we look at the past with rose colored glasses we need to realize that the fight for balance of what is actually good for us and what can be had cheaply is still going on. For this reason alone, I highly recommend this book. "
188,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63970501-maureen-caupp,4,"A very interesting read about the work done at the turn of the twentieth century by the United States Department of Agriculture to determine the contents of food and drinks, the impacts of the added compounds on health, and the continuing battle to regulate harmful additives and require truthful labeling. At the turn of the century food manufactures used dangerous preservatives such as formaldehyde in dairy and meats to cover up already spoiling products. Manufactures also used cheap synthetic dyes and flavorings to cut costs. For example ketchup often didn't have tomatoes and strawberry jam didn't contain strawberries. Instead both were any available food scraps left over (pumpkin rinds, apple cores and skins, etc.) dyed red.This book focuses on the efforts of the chief chemist at the USDA for over 30 years around the turn of the century who worked tirelessly and was a strong advocate for regulation and accurate labeling. It also goes into some of the legal battles involved in regulating additives to food and drink. Just like today whenever any regulating legislation managed to get passed into law manufactures pushed back to weaken the new laws. "

My coworker, now my manager, requested the library purchase it, and they did! So she borrowed it and said it was fascinating.Then when it came out in paperback, both blogs again ran blurbs, and I checked it out.I would consider this a must-read book. It details so much about common assumptions of the public, government, and business, and WHY government is absolutely essential to putting roadblocks into the path of capitalism.Some might say that the book bogs down a bit when it details all the different shit (sometimes literally) the Bureau of Chemistry was finding in food products, but it never repeated itself, and it honestly could have gone on forever. The borax, the salicylic acid, the lead, it just never stopped coming. The rise of industrial chemistry, while ultimately a good thing, makes me shiver in fear at what it would have been like to have been alive then.Absolutely loved the epilogue where the author warns against this presidential administration pointing out that it directly mirrors what Harvey Washington Wiley was up against.Those who are not students of history are condemned to repeat the past, indeed."

It is essential to understand that throughout time, industry/corporations in masse have actively fought against protecting individuals if they perceived the requested change would have a negative impact on their profit. These corporations have expended significant revenue to market the political idea of the deregulation of all the things. This book is a great example of why, as a society, there is a necessity for many of the existing regulations. It also does a good job of highlighting corporations and individuals who were open to change and saw the value in a pure food movement and how it could be economically and socially beneficial. Personally, I think I should have read this slower and just read a chapter here and there. To some extent, the chapters and build up were formulaic and came off as a tad dense. This is likely because the majority of the book discussed how a food or beverage was adulterated and the steps taken to stop the incorrect labeling or toxic additives. The adulterations were often similar and the process of fighting the deceptions would be similar, ie. education of the public and the attempt to pass laws to prohibit the additives or mislabeling. Due to the somewhat repetitive nature, I think I would have liked to spread out this book. With that said, I still enjoyed this read and recommend it!

205,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6293008-filippe,5,"“The Shutdown is Bad For Anyone Who Eats Food”, says Stephen Colbert on Friday, January 11. “Don't Panic: The Government Shutdown Isn't Making Food Unsafe”, counters NPR’s Dan Charles on Weekend Update the following morning.It’s 2019, but you’d be forgiven for thinking of pre-1906 America after reading this wonderful account of the U.S. “pure food movement” and its most steadfast defender and all-around gadfly, chemist Harvey W. Wiley, a man I’d heard nothing about before. As in all of her previous books, Blum’s conversational tone belies meticulous research and attention to detail. Each chapter, charmingly epigraphed with a line or verse from a poem by Wiley himself, is filled with quotations from primary sources; ancillary characters are given their due. Decades of political warfare and industry opposition to pure-food-and-drug laws (familiar names such as Monsanto, Dow Chemical, and Coca-Cola all make unflattering appearances) are richly described.The hand-wringing ineffectiveness of early enforcement, endless concessions to regulation-hating manufacturers, conflicts of interest, and downright corruption in the Department of Agriculture and elsewhere are frustrating, unsurprising, and terribly modern, but I sometimes found myself equally exasperated by Wiley’s crusader-style single-mindedness (that word’s in the title for a reason).I do wish the book had focused more on Wiley’s later-life work with Good Housekeeping Laboratories and covered a bit more of the history of the Food and Drug Administration (newly founded at the book’s close and Wiley’s death in 1930). I wish Wiley’s work and that of the pure-food defenders was not still under continuous undermining more than a century later, as the Epilogue notes. And, tangentially, I would love to read a similar biography/history of Frances Oldham Kelsey’s half-century of work at the FDA. What a lovely parallel (or sequel) that would make."

This history of the fight for food safety laws in the United States is a disturbing page-turner that literally kept me up at night because I didn’t want to put it down.As food manufacturers in the late 19th century embraced chemicals as preservatives, sweeteners or colourants to keep food bright and tasty, they were under no obligation to tell customers what was in their milk or meat, coffee or candy. Whiskey might not even be whiskey. Children died after drinking “chemically improved” milk, canned meat sent to soldiers fighting in the Spanish-American war was described as “embalmed beef.” Formaldehyde was used to deal with the sour taste of milk and extend its life, while chalk was added to whiten it. Borax improved the taste of rancid butter, candy was coloured with poisonous dyes that included arsenic or lead. Saccharine (marketed by Monsanto more than a century ago) presented a health risk if consumed in large enough doses, which was likely because it was an unlabelled sweetener in many products: from soft drinks to jam to canned vegetables. There was no requirement for any food to be or even include what it said it was. Spices could be predominantly anything but the pepper or ginger promised on the bottle, which may include burned shells, charcoal and even floor sweepings. Honey was often tinted corn syrup, tea leaves may not be tea and “fraud was not just pervasive; it was standard practice.”Any effort to introduce safety testing or require a breakdown of ingredients was met with sharp resistance from industry, which often received a sympathetic ear in the White House across a handful of administrations. At the dawn of the 20th century, the manufacturer of a formaldehyde-infused preservative called Freezine argued that the public should just embrace whatever chemicals prevented food decay without question, noting “I wish to say that every one of us eats embalmed meat and we know it and we like it.” Weaving all of this together is a biography of chemist Dr. Harvey Wiley, who refused to back down in his quest for consumer protection. Wiley, chief chemist for the US Department of Agriculture, spent decades fighting for regulations, investigation and even basic labelling to inform consumers what was their food or drinks. The Pure Food and Drug Act, passed in 1906, was known to many as “Dr. Wiley’s law” although he is largely a footnote in history today. In his later years, Wiley was bitter about the struggle and the constant pushback from industry for any regulation. Pulitzer Prize-winning science journalist Deborah Blum has done a fabulous job of bringing this era to life and outlining the challenges facing Wiley and others who tried to spotlight the importance of food safety. It’s rare to celebrate the efforts of a civil servant, especially where those who work for the public good are often painted by politicians as an impediment to business, a consideration spelled out in Wiley’s day. It’s also very true in the 21st century, where the current president vowed to eliminate any regulation that kills jobs. The Poison Squad: One Chemist's Single-Minded Crusade for Food Safety at the Turn of the Twentieth Century is a first-rate thriller. 4.5 stars."
210,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72623806-nicholle,5,"I give this book 5 stars (out of 5). I loved the science/chemistry and history behind the story. The author is an excellent science writer and wrote such an intriguing story. The parts where she described the politics behind the story were boring to me (I cannot stand politics), but a necessary evil in order to describe how the story played out. This story is about chemist Dr. Harvey Washington Wiley and how he wanted to make sure that all food was safe, or at least labeled, from adulterants. Such adulterants were arsenic, dyes from coal tar, and boric acid (or borax), just to name a few. He was truly a man ahead of his time because during a time where most individuals (and even companies) were ignorant of science and most companies producing food only cared about making a profit, he strove to make sure food was safe from unnecessary additives (or adulterants) by actually testing the additives to prove that they were in fact harmful to people.Dr. Wiley set up experiments to feed a group of individuals adulterants, such as boric acid, by comparing that group against a control group not being fed adulterants. The data he and his team of chemists generated was not only rigorous and scientific, but also proved his hypothesis that the adulterants being added to food were in fact harmful to people. Taking this data a step further, he extrapolated that if these adulterants were harmful to healthy (male) adults, these adulterants were even more harmful to babies, children, and the elderly. Dr. Wiley fought almost his whole career against the politics of the unscrupulous lobby behind the companies making the adulterated foods. What I found so fascinating was that among the few companies that did mass produce food without adulterants was the company that made Heinz ketchup. The owner behind the ketchup not only wanted to make food without adulterants, but he also wanted to prove that making unadulterated food could be profitable, since that was the main argument behind the companies that adulterated food was that they could not be profitable. What I truly loved about Dr. Wiley was his desire to speak up about the chemistry behind the adulterants, without dumbing it down, to women. He wrote countless articles in magazines and publications geared towards women. He knew that getting women (who make up 50% of the population) on board with his cause would only further his fight in the political arena to achieve his goals. Dr. Wiley even married a suffragist and supported her desire to be jailed for her fight for women to vote.Another aspect I found so fascinating about this book is the role the government needs to play to protect the average American, or consumer, from unregulated business that cares more about profit than the health of the consumer by taking shortcuts. While I read this book the government shut down was occurring. And it also seems the trend in the current administration is to cozy up to big business that may or may not care about the average American consumer in their bottom line. Only time will tell if this is occurring, and unfortunately as history does repeat itself, who (and how many) will have to get sick and or die before government steps in to protect the average American consumer? "
211,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56837139-brandon-polzin,3,"This book was an enjoyable narrative about a story that I never thought I would be interested in. The topic of food safety is a vitally important one, and I am grateful that a person like Harvey Washington Wiley had a lifelong goal of supporting food transparency for the benefit of the United States' citizens. I am a sucker for the time period in American History that a large portion of this book is set in, as Theodore Roosevelt is one of my favorite historical figures. He is painted as a protagonist in most of the other books that I've read, so it was amusing to see him portrayed in an antagonistic light here.All that being said, I felt this book had a few shortcomings. I may be spoiled after reading biographical narratives by Siddharta Mukherjee and Edmund Morris, but I felt illustrative descriptions of characters and settings were lacking in this book. I certainly was never bored, but it lacked the fiction-like and seemingly whimsical appeal of other critically acclaimed nonfiction narratives. It may be, though, that the nature of this story was not as exciting as those I am comparing it to, so I don't want to place the blame solely on Blum's shoulders.Another issue I had was the intermittent lack of focus/mislabeling of the book. The subtitle of the book (""One Chemist's...) implies that it is a biography about one man, that man being the aforementioned Wiley. Blum went into great detail about him, but would then move on to other parallel stories that coincided with the progression of food safety within the United States. This was obviously all relevant to the overarching story the book was trying to tell, but because of the excessive breaks from Wiley I felt this book should have been explicitly marketed as a story of food safety as a whole, not JUST as a narrative about Wiley. It's a nitpicky criticism, but I found myself being taken out of the story and thinking about it as I read the book.All in all though, I would recommend this book. I love that there was a ""cast of characters"" in the beginning to reference to whenever I forgot about a person's name or their significance. I also loved they way Blum used the story of food safety in the USA to emphasize the control that big business has over the way consumers act and think as a whole, and the importance of a dissenting opinion when everyone is all too eager to comply.I would rate this book a 3.5 if I could, but I'll round up because I'm feeling nice. I hope you can get your hands on a copy sometime soon!"
212,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1468458-lisa,4,"So why do they bleach flour? Read this and you will find out and probably never buy bleached flour again. Having worked in QA in the pharmaceutical industry, I was familiar with the Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906 as the beginning of the regulation of pharmaceuticals, but hadn't really known that its major impetus was on food and I had never heard of the man who had such a big part of making it law, Dr. Harvey Washington Wiley. It was not just unclean production practices that put the food supply at risk of contamination. The dangers included what was purposefully added like heavy metal and coal tar food dyes, especially in candy; formaldehyde in meat and milk; preservatives that had never been tested for safety of human consumption; sugar replacements that had no caloric value; and other fillers added just to improve the profit margin. Some of these additives were even marketed to grocers and food producers solely based on their ability to be undetected and increase profitability by dilution of the actual food product or by masking spoilage. People were literally being killed by the food they ate. The book details just how adulterated our food supply was prior to this act, how much industry worked to keep it that way, how much politicians were unconcerned about the health and welfare of the common person, and how hard Dr. Wiley had to work to protect consumers. Some things never really change and the parallels to our modern world are easy to see. Industry does not, never has, and never will self-regulate if it means less profitability. There were some good guy manufacturers who were promoting pure food, such as H.J. Heinz Company, but they were the rare exception. Some of these same companies that were willingly putting our health at risk over 100 years ago are still in business: Armour, Swift, Coca-cola, Monsanto, McCormick. Despite the debt we owe him and his Poison Squad volunteers, they and Dr. Wiley have mostly been forgotten today. This book attempts to correct that. I fully appreciated the inclusion of historic photos, political cartoons, and food ads. It was especially gratifying to see the woman working in the chemistry lab in the early 1900's. Deborah Blum also includes Dr. Wiley's wife, Anna Kelton Wiley, who was one of the suffragists jailed by President Wilson. Are these hints at a future book on the womens' suffrage movement? I could completely see how this book could be born out of the research from ""The Poisoner's Handbook"" due to the pure whiskey issue. "
213,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71163840-steven-meyers,5,"If you are under the impression that food was awesome back in the “good ole days,” then, man oh man, Ms. Blum’s book will relieve you of that misconception. ‘The Poison Squad’ shows how business greed and political chicanery worked hand-in-hand to place private interests over consumer safety. As the author states, “Fraud was not just pervasive, it was standard practice.” The decades-long fight over supplying consumers with information about what is in their food and the toxic dangers in it was enlightening but discouraging to read. Ms. Blum is a highly respected author who has written numerous books in the field of science. Her writing style is direct and easy to understand. The years covered are from 1844 through 1938. Buckle up, you’re in for a illuminating scary ride. During the mid-1800s, manufacturers and food processors discovered certain inexpensive chemicals could imitate foods and hide unhealthy diseased meats or other perishable products. Factory environments were hellholes, riddled with unsafe and unclean practices. Into this business atmosphere came Harvey Washington Wiley, a government chemist, who began experiments on the quality of foods, exposed business deceptions, and made the public aware of what their families were eating and drinking. Needless to say, company feces hit the fan big time. While Ms. Blum does center the book on Mr. Wiley’s actions, a plethora of other food safety advocates and detractors are also explained. During his three decades crusading against business chicanery he became a very popular and widely loved individual by the general public. Politicians and businessmen, however, would have liked nothing better than for Mr. Wiley to wind up in a can of corned beef or be fired. I never heard of the guy until I picked up ‘The Poison Squad.’ ‘The Poison Squad’ shows that there were responsible high-minded corporations such as Heinz who practiced and advocated for safe foods and there were plenty of nasty ones such as Monsanto who aggressively fought to allow their “additives” to remain in the market. The way companies acted about possibly having to supply consumers with ingredient information so they could make more informed choices, you’d think it was the next thing to Armageddon. It would be naïve to believe that those awful days are completely gone and corporations now place consumer safety over greed. Sure, like yesteryear, there are businesses that are good corporate stewards but like the old Russian proverb we should, “Trust but verify” before embracing a business’s assertions, especially when it comes to consumer safety. Greed has not somehow magically disappeared. In the author’s epilogue she states, “The story of consumer protection in the United States is often to story of a country playing defense, an account of government regulators waking up, time and time again, to yet another public health crisis.” In other words, once a sizable number of consumers bite the dust and it gets enough press exposure, then politicians and government act. Compared to the time period covered in the book, food safety has greatly improved. However, many businesses still focus on profit over public welfare is still very much with us. Ms. Blum has, yet again, written another highly informative work. Read it and weep."
214,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2125854-becca-younk,3,"I loved The Poisoner's Handbook, so of course I had to read this when I spied it on display at the library. It's not quite as good, but still a compelling and interesting read. It's a bit scary to think about all the ingredients listed on labels that I wouldn't even be able to guess what they are, but at least they're listed! I can google them if I'm so inclined. Whereas previously, food manufacturers could just throw in basically whatever they wanted. The book follows Dr. Wiley at the Agriculture Department as he conducts studies in an effort to pass a Pure Food law. Dr. Wiley sounds great, he ends up marrying a suffragette, which is cool. I think where this book sort of falls flat is all the emphasis on the trials and the inner workings of the Department and politicians. It's interesting for awhile, and then gets a bit tedious and feels a little too much like office drama. While The Poisoner's Handbook gives specific examples of how poisons killed people, this book tends to just list deaths or illnesses as numbers. ""100 children died from such-and-such in Indiana"" type of thing, without going into detail. Food safety isn't as shocking as poisons, sure, but I wish there were more human impact stories. ""Cure-all"" medications are briefly mentioned, and it makes me wonder if Blum will write an entire book on those. Crossing my fingers she does, because that would be fascinating. Twice in the book Blum writes Midland, Michigan, as Midlands, Michigan. Once I can believe is a typo. But twice? It takes two seconds of googling to find that the headquarters of Dow is in Midland, no 's.' I find I'm very annoyed by the lack of caring to get a city name correct. Is publishing in such a bad state that there are no editors?"
215,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4454466-amy,5,"Firstly, I think there should be a law enacted declaring that Deborah Blum must author all history/non-fiction books for popular culture. She has an incredible talent for writing history and, in particular, making the areas of scientific history unbelievably exciting!After thoroughly enjoying her other book, The Poisoner’s Handbook, several years back, I was eager to pick up another one by her. The Poison Squad explores the unique history of food safety laws in the U.S. and the influence of historical figures on the creation of the Food Safety and Drug Administration — specifically Upton Sinclair’s The Jungle and Harvey Washington Wiley, the famous 19th century chemist who identified poisons in everyday manufactured foods we love to eat. The author also provides intriguing cases of food poisoning scandals by manufactured foods throughout the 19th and early 20th century. For example, in June 1899, the city of Cincinnati had to warn its citizens of an epidemic of stomach problems following the consumption of “embalmed” beef. “More than one thousand people had fallen ill in a single week after eating beef.” The culprit? Two new brand-name preservatives at the time that contained formaldehyde as a main ingredient. (p. 61) Truly a fascinating history! So glad we live in the times that we do! Highly recommended read. :-)"
216,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28745526-allie,4,"I came across this book while at the Boston Science museum and knew I had pick it up. It took me several weeks to get through this book but, I still really enjoyed it. This book basically covers the story of Wiley and his fight for food safety regulations. It also discusses the effect politics can have on regulations and consumer protection as well as the creation of the 1906 Pure Food and Drug Act. It is quite alarming to me how we allow politics to impede the creation of regulations to keep people safe. This book provides examples of times when scientists and researchers were providing data about an adulterant saying, ""this can hurt you"" and industry saying, "" no it's fine"" and then politicians agreeing with industry. While we don't want to hurt business and our economy it is important to keep in mind that generally companies in industry are looking out for their own interest. Also I am so grateful for the safety regulations we have now. We don't have to worry about formalin in milk etc. One of my favorite quotes from this book was from Wiley in regards to the purpose of science which is "" to search for truth and thereby to elevate and improve mankind"". "
217,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63521529-beth-menendez,5,"Solid 4.5 stars. I'm dinging it half a star because it is a scince-y book that can get a little dry at times and I think it may lose some readers because of this. However, for anyone who think that the Whole Foods movement and Clean Eating is a new fad, you are gravely mistaken. Deborah Blum does a fantastic job of making Dr. Harvey Washington Wiley come to life. Dr. Washington was the Chief Chemist in the Department of Chemistry and fought for YEARS trying to get congress to approve bills for the Pure Food and Drug movement. Before this movement it was completely legal to add preservatives to food so that spoiled food could then be served to the masses. Yes. Spoiled food. Since mass refrigeration was not really a thing yet, nor was any kind of safety guidelines for chemicals (whether used in food or drugs) all kinds of sketchy things were going on with food for the masses. Milk a little off? No worries, we'll put formaldehyde in it. Oh, was that cow a bit sick? No worries, we'll use some potassium nitrate (saltpeter) to keep it okay. It does not mater that saltpeter will actually kill you. It's cheaper than sodium chloride (table salt) so it's fine. Seriously. The stuff they put in medicines... eek. Just eek. So how does Dr Wiley come in? He began to protest that what manufacturers put in things was deceiving the populations. That maple syrup is not syrup. It's coal tar derived color agents (seriously) and water with a little sugar. Later with a lot of saccharin in it. Because it's cheaper. There were huge arguments over corn syrup as a cheaper additive to foods than sugar. Wait - aren't we STILL arguing about this. Yes, yes we are. After reading this book I am realizing how much has stayed the same and not changed a bit. Oh the topics might be a little different but the court case involving Coca Cola and their ingredients that were both addicting to people and toxic to them that went round and round could be replaced with the energy drinks of today all over the same chemical - caffeine.  The way that what we eat is literally influenced by who is in the White House was a bit of a shock. Dr. Wiley had harder times certain years simply because the president in office elected secretaries that made Dr. Wiley's job almost impossible. The fact that the main secretary to the USDA over him had ties to manufacturing making his job nearly impossible at the end of his term could have read like it was happening today. Upton Sinclair's book The Jungle was more than just a novel - it was a whistle blowing land mine that showed many what was going on with the ""food"" we eat. Even with that book selling thousands of copies there was much attempt to discredit Sinclair which were eventually successful because Sinclair was a socialist - he just wanted everyone to get a fair (clean healthy) shake. Manufacturers and lobbyists were not about to let this happen and so he became a pariah in Washington.  The one thing that resounded throughout the book is how much we fight over the minutiae until there is a national epidemic sadly has not changed. The 1906 original Pure Foods bill (Dr Wiley's bill) came into effect after many children died from the formaldehyde in the milk after YEARS of dying on the floor of Congress. The 1938 bill that beefed (no pun intended) up the bill came about after many children died from taking cough syrup that had been made with sweetened with diethylene glycol (antifreeze). Similar bills were passed in 1956 and 1971 after injury to women and children. Why do I mention this? Because we are STILL fighting this battle - remember when there was salmonella in the peanut butter? Remember how no one could eat salad last Thanksgiving because of E.Coli? Yes, we are still fighting getting clean, pure food from manufacturers. If that is not scary I cannot think what is. Before we look at the past with rose colored glasses we need to realize that the fight for balance of what is actually good for us and what can be had cheaply is still going on. For this reason alone, I highly recommend this book. "
218,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63970501-maureen-caupp,4,"A very interesting read about the work done at the turn of the twentieth century by the United States Department of Agriculture to determine the contents of food and drinks, the impacts of the added compounds on health, and the continuing battle to regulate harmful additives and require truthful labeling. At the turn of the century food manufactures used dangerous preservatives such as formaldehyde in dairy and meats to cover up already spoiling products. Manufactures also used cheap synthetic dyes and flavorings to cut costs. For example ketchup often didn't have tomatoes and strawberry jam didn't contain strawberries. Instead both were any available food scraps left over (pumpkin rinds, apple cores and skins, etc.) dyed red.This book focuses on the efforts of the chief chemist at the USDA for over 30 years around the turn of the century who worked tirelessly and was a strong advocate for regulation and accurate labeling. It also goes into some of the legal battles involved in regulating additives to food and drink. Just like today whenever any regulating legislation managed to get passed into law manufactures pushed back to weaken the new laws. "

My coworker, now my manager, requested the library purchase it, and they did! So she borrowed it and said it was fascinating.Then when it came out in paperback, both blogs again ran blurbs, and I checked it out.I would consider this a must-read book. It details so much about common assumptions of the public, government, and business, and WHY government is absolutely essential to putting roadblocks into the path of capitalism.Some might say that the book bogs down a bit when it details all the different shit (sometimes literally) the Bureau of Chemistry was finding in food products, but it never repeated itself, and it honestly could have gone on forever. The borax, the salicylic acid, the lead, it just never stopped coming. The rise of industrial chemistry, while ultimately a good thing, makes me shiver in fear at what it would have been like to have been alive then.Absolutely loved the epilogue where the author warns against this presidential administration pointing out that it directly mirrors what Harvey Washington Wiley was up against.Those who are not students of history are condemned to repeat the past, indeed."

It is essential to understand that throughout time, industry/corporations in masse have actively fought against protecting individuals if they perceived the requested change would have a negative impact on their profit. These corporations have expended significant revenue to market the political idea of the deregulation of all the things. This book is a great example of why, as a society, there is a necessity for many of the existing regulations. It also does a good job of highlighting corporations and individuals who were open to change and saw the value in a pure food movement and how it could be economically and socially beneficial. Personally, I think I should have read this slower and just read a chapter here and there. To some extent, the chapters and build up were formulaic and came off as a tad dense. This is likely because the majority of the book discussed how a food or beverage was adulterated and the steps taken to stop the incorrect labeling or toxic additives. The adulterations were often similar and the process of fighting the deceptions would be similar, ie. education of the public and the attempt to pass laws to prohibit the additives or mislabeling. Due to the somewhat repetitive nature, I think I would have liked to spread out this book. With that said, I still enjoyed this read and recommend it!

Wiley, a man I’d heard nothing about before. As in all of her previous books, Blum’s conversational tone belies meticulous research and attention to detail. Each chapter, charmingly epigraphed with a line or verse from a poem by Wiley himself, is filled with quotations from primary sources; ancillary characters are given their due. Decades of political warfare and industry opposition to pure-food-and-drug laws (familiar names such as Monsanto, Dow Chemical, and Coca-Cola all make unflattering appearances) are richly described.The hand-wringing ineffectiveness of early enforcement, endless concessions to regulation-hating manufacturers, conflicts of interest, and downright corruption in the Department of Agriculture and elsewhere are frustrating, unsurprising, and terribly modern, but I sometimes found myself equally exasperated by Wiley’s crusader-style single-mindedness (that word’s in the title for a reason).I do wish the book had focused more on Wiley’s later-life work with Good Housekeeping Laboratories and covered a bit more of the history of the Food and Drug Administration (newly founded at the book’s close and Wiley’s death in 1930). I wish Wiley’s work and that of the pure-food defenders was not still under continuous undermining more than a century later, as the Epilogue notes. And, tangentially, I would love to read a similar biography/history of Frances Oldham Kelsey’s half-century of work at the FDA. What a lovely parallel (or sequel) that would make."

239,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76170804-judy-monchuk,4,"What a fascinating and frightening read. This history of the fight for food safety laws in the United States is a disturbing page-turner that literally kept me up at night because I didn’t want to put it down.As food manufacturers in the late 19th century embraced chemicals as preservatives, sweeteners or colourants to keep food bright and tasty, they were under no obligation to tell customers what was in their milk or meat, coffee or candy. Whiskey might not even be whiskey. Children died after drinking “chemically improved” milk, canned meat sent to soldiers fighting in the Spanish-American war was described as “embalmed beef.” Formaldehyde was used to deal with the sour taste of milk and extend its life, while chalk was added to whiten it. Borax improved the taste of rancid butter, candy was coloured with poisonous dyes that included arsenic or lead. Saccharine (marketed by Monsanto more than a century ago) presented a health risk if consumed in large enough doses, which was likely because it was an unlabelled sweetener in many products: from soft drinks to jam to canned vegetables. There was no requirement for any food to be or even include what it said it was. Spices could be predominantly anything but the pepper or ginger promised on the bottle, which may include burned shells, charcoal and even floor sweepings. Honey was often tinted corn syrup, tea leaves may not be tea and “fraud was not just pervasive; it was standard practice.”Any effort to introduce safety testing or require a breakdown of ingredients was met with sharp resistance from industry, which often received a sympathetic ear in the White House across a handful of administrations. At the dawn of the 20th century, the manufacturer of a formaldehyde-infused preservative called Freezine argued that the public should just embrace whatever chemicals prevented food decay without question, noting “I wish to say that every one of us eats embalmed meat and we know it and we like it.” Weaving all of this together is a biography of chemist Dr. Harvey Wiley, who refused to back down in his quest for consumer protection. Wiley, chief chemist for the US Department of Agriculture, spent decades fighting for regulations, investigation and even basic labelling to inform consumers what was their food or drinks. The Pure Food and Drug Act, passed in 1906, was known to many as “Dr. Wiley’s law” although he is largely a footnote in history today. In his later years, Wiley was bitter about the struggle and the constant pushback from industry for any regulation. Pulitzer Prize-winning science journalist Deborah Blum has done a fabulous job of bringing this era to life and outlining the challenges facing Wiley and others who tried to spotlight the importance of food safety. It’s rare to celebrate the efforts of a civil servant, especially where those who work for the public good are often painted by politicians as an impediment to business, a consideration spelled out in Wiley’s day. It’s also very true in the 21st century, where the current president vowed to eliminate any regulation that kills jobs. The Poison Squad: One Chemist's Single-Minded Crusade for Food Safety at the Turn of the Twentieth Century is a first-rate thriller. 4.5 stars."
240,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72623806-nicholle,5,"I give this book 5 stars (out of 5). I loved the science/chemistry and history behind the story. The author is an excellent science writer and wrote such an intriguing story. The parts where she described the politics behind the story were boring to me (I cannot stand politics), but a necessary evil in order to describe how the story played out. This story is about chemist Dr. Harvey Washington Wiley and how he wanted to make sure that all food was safe, or at least labeled, from adulterants. Such adulterants were arsenic, dyes from coal tar, and boric acid (or borax), just to name a few. He was truly a man ahead of his time because during a time where most individuals (and even companies) were ignorant of science and most companies producing food only cared about making a profit, he strove to make sure food was safe from unnecessary additives (or adulterants) by actually testing the additives to prove that they were in fact harmful to people.Dr. Wiley set up experiments to feed a group of individuals adulterants, such as boric acid, by comparing that group against a control group not being fed adulterants. The data he and his team of chemists generated was not only rigorous and scientific, but also proved his hypothesis that the adulterants being added to food were in fact harmful to people. Taking this data a step further, he extrapolated that if these adulterants were harmful to healthy (male) adults, these adulterants were even more harmful to babies, children, and the elderly. Dr. Wiley fought almost his whole career against the politics of the unscrupulous lobby behind the companies making the adulterated foods. What I found so fascinating was that among the few companies that did mass produce food without adulterants was the company that made Heinz ketchup. The owner behind the ketchup not only wanted to make food without adulterants, but he also wanted to prove that making unadulterated food could be profitable, since that was the main argument behind the companies that adulterated food was that they could not be profitable. What I truly loved about Dr. Wiley was his desire to speak up about the chemistry behind the adulterants, without dumbing it down, to women. He wrote countless articles in magazines and publications geared towards women. He knew that getting women (who make up 50% of the population) on board with his cause would only further his fight in the political arena to achieve his goals. Dr. Wiley even married a suffragist and supported her desire to be jailed for her fight for women to vote.Another aspect I found so fascinating about this book is the role the government needs to play to protect the average American, or consumer, from unregulated business that cares more about profit than the health of the consumer by taking shortcuts. While I read this book the government shut down was occurring. And it also seems the trend in the current administration is to cozy up to big business that may or may not care about the average American consumer in their bottom line. Only time will tell if this is occurring, and unfortunately as history does repeat itself, who (and how many) will have to get sick and or die before government steps in to protect the average American consumer? "
241,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56837139-brandon-polzin,3,"This book was an enjoyable narrative about a story that I never thought I would be interested in. The topic of food safety is a vitally important one, and I am grateful that a person like Harvey Washington Wiley had a lifelong goal of supporting food transparency for the benefit of the United States' citizens. I am a sucker for the time period in American History that a large portion of this book is set in, as Theodore Roosevelt is one of my favorite historical figures. He is painted as a protagonist in most of the other books that I've read, so it was amusing to see him portrayed in an antagonistic light here.All that being said, I felt this book had a few shortcomings. I may be spoiled after reading biographical narratives by Siddharta Mukherjee and Edmund Morris, but I felt illustrative descriptions of characters and settings were lacking in this book. I certainly was never bored, but it lacked the fiction-like and seemingly whimsical appeal of other critically acclaimed nonfiction narratives. It may be, though, that the nature of this story was not as exciting as those I am comparing it to, so I don't want to place the blame solely on Blum's shoulders.Another issue I had was the intermittent lack of focus/mislabeling of the book. The subtitle of the book (""One Chemist's...) implies that it is a biography about one man, that man being the aforementioned Wiley. Blum went into great detail about him, but would then move on to other parallel stories that coincided with the progression of food safety within the United States. This was obviously all relevant to the overarching story the book was trying to tell, but because of the excessive breaks from Wiley I felt this book should have been explicitly marketed as a story of food safety as a whole, not JUST as a narrative about Wiley. It's a nitpicky criticism, but I found myself being taken out of the story and thinking about it as I read the book.All in all though, I would recommend this book. I love that there was a ""cast of characters"" in the beginning to reference to whenever I forgot about a person's name or their significance. I also loved they way Blum used the story of food safety in the USA to emphasize the control that big business has over the way consumers act and think as a whole, and the importance of a dissenting opinion when everyone is all too eager to comply.I would rate this book a 3.5 if I could, but I'll round up because I'm feeling nice. I hope you can get your hands on a copy sometime soon!"
242,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1468458-lisa,4,"So why do they bleach flour? Read this and you will find out and probably never buy bleached flour again. Having worked in QA in the pharmaceutical industry, I was familiar with the Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906 as the beginning of the regulation of pharmaceuticals, but hadn't really known that its major impetus was on food and I had never heard of the man who had such a big part of making it law, Dr. Harvey Washington Wiley. It was not just unclean production practices that put the food supply at risk of contamination. The dangers included what was purposefully added like heavy metal and coal tar food dyes, especially in candy; formaldehyde in meat and milk; preservatives that had never been tested for safety of human consumption; sugar replacements that had no caloric value; and other fillers added just to improve the profit margin. Some of these additives were even marketed to grocers and food producers solely based on their ability to be undetected and increase profitability by dilution of the actual food product or by masking spoilage. People were literally being killed by the food they ate. The book details just how adulterated our food supply was prior to this act, how much industry worked to keep it that way, how much politicians were unconcerned about the health and welfare of the common person, and how hard Dr. Wiley had to work to protect consumers. Some things never really change and the parallels to our modern world are easy to see. Industry does not, never has, and never will self-regulate if it means less profitability. There were some good guy manufacturers who were promoting pure food, such as H.J. Heinz Company, but they were the rare exception. Some of these same companies that were willingly putting our health at risk over 100 years ago are still in business: Armour, Swift, Coca-cola, Monsanto, McCormick. Despite the debt we owe him and his Poison Squad volunteers, they and Dr. Wiley have mostly been forgotten today. This book attempts to correct that. I fully appreciated the inclusion of historic photos, political cartoons, and food ads. It was especially gratifying to see the woman working in the chemistry lab in the early 1900's. Deborah Blum also includes Dr. Wiley's wife, Anna Kelton Wiley, who was one of the suffragists jailed by President Wilson. Are these hints at a future book on the womens' suffrage movement? I could completely see how this book could be born out of the research from ""The Poisoner's Handbook"" due to the pure whiskey issue. "
243,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71163840-steven-meyers,5,"If you are under the impression that food was awesome back in the “good ole days,” then, man oh man, Ms. Blum’s book will relieve you of that misconception. ‘The Poison Squad’ shows how business greed and political chicanery worked hand-in-hand to place private interests over consumer safety. As the author states, “Fraud was not just pervasive, it was standard practice.” The decades-long fight over supplying consumers with information about what is in their food and the toxic dangers in it was enlightening but discouraging to read. Ms. Blum is a highly respected author who has written numerous books in the field of science. Her writing style is direct and easy to understand. The years covered are from 1844 through 1938. Buckle up, you’re in for a illuminating scary ride. During the mid-1800s, manufacturers and food processors discovered certain inexpensive chemicals could imitate foods and hide unhealthy diseased meats or other perishable products. Factory environments were hellholes, riddled with unsafe and unclean practices. Into this business atmosphere came Harvey Washington Wiley, a government chemist, who began experiments on the quality of foods, exposed business deceptions, and made the public aware of what their families were eating and drinking. Needless to say, company feces hit the fan big time. While Ms. Blum does center the book on Mr. Wiley’s actions, a plethora of other food safety advocates and detractors are also explained. During his three decades crusading against business chicanery he became a very popular and widely loved individual by the general public. Politicians and businessmen, however, would have liked nothing better than for Mr. Wiley to wind up in a can of corned beef or be fired. I never heard of the guy until I picked up ‘The Poison Squad.’ ‘The Poison Squad’ shows that there were responsible high-minded corporations such as Heinz who practiced and advocated for safe foods and there were plenty of nasty ones such as Monsanto who aggressively fought to allow their “additives” to remain in the market. The way companies acted about possibly having to supply consumers with ingredient information so they could make more informed choices, you’d think it was the next thing to Armageddon. It would be naïve to believe that those awful days are completely gone and corporations now place consumer safety over greed. Sure, like yesteryear, there are businesses that are good corporate stewards but like the old Russian proverb we should, “Trust but verify” before embracing a business’s assertions, especially when it comes to consumer safety. Greed has not somehow magically disappeared. In the author’s epilogue she states, “The story of consumer protection in the United States is often to story of a country playing defense, an account of government regulators waking up, time and time again, to yet another public health crisis.” In other words, once a sizable number of consumers bite the dust and it gets enough press exposure, then politicians and government act. Compared to the time period covered in the book, food safety has greatly improved. However, many businesses still focus on profit over public welfare is still very much with us. Ms. Blum has, yet again, written another highly informative work. Read it and weep."
244,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2125854-becca-younk,3,"I loved The Poisoner's Handbook, so of course I had to read this when I spied it on display at the library. It's not quite as good, but still a compelling and interesting read. It's a bit scary to think about all the ingredients listed on labels that I wouldn't even be able to guess what they are, but at least they're listed! I can google them if I'm so inclined. Whereas previously, food manufacturers could just throw in basically whatever they wanted. The book follows Dr. Wiley at the Agriculture Department as he conducts studies in an effort to pass a Pure Food law. Dr. Wiley sounds great, he ends up marrying a suffragette, which is cool. I think where this book sort of falls flat is all the emphasis on the trials and the inner workings of the Department and politicians. It's interesting for awhile, and then gets a bit tedious and feels a little too much like office drama. While The Poisoner's Handbook gives specific examples of how poisons killed people, this book tends to just list deaths or illnesses as numbers. ""100 children died from such-and-such in Indiana"" type of thing, without going into detail. Food safety isn't as shocking as poisons, sure, but I wish there were more human impact stories. ""Cure-all"" medications are briefly mentioned, and it makes me wonder if Blum will write an entire book on those. Crossing my fingers she does, because that would be fascinating. Twice in the book Blum writes Midland, Michigan, as Midlands, Michigan. Once I can believe is a typo. But twice? It takes two seconds of googling to find that the headquarters of Dow is in Midland, no 's.' I find I'm very annoyed by the lack of caring to get a city name correct. Is publishing in such a bad state that there are no editors?"
245,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4454466-amy,5,"Firstly, I think there should be a law enacted declaring that Deborah Blum must author all history/non-fiction books for popular culture. She has an incredible talent for writing history and, in particular, making the areas of scientific history unbelievably exciting!After thoroughly enjoying her other book, The Poisoner’s Handbook, several years back, I was eager to pick up another one by her. The Poison Squad explores the unique history of food safety laws in the U.S. and the influence of historical figures on the creation of the Food Safety and Drug Administration — specifically Upton Sinclair’s The Jungle and Harvey Washington Wiley, the famous 19th century chemist who identified poisons in everyday manufactured foods we love to eat. The author also provides intriguing cases of food poisoning scandals by manufactured foods throughout the 19th and early 20th century. For example, in June 1899, the city of Cincinnati had to warn its citizens of an epidemic of stomach problems following the consumption of “embalmed” beef. “More than one thousand people had fallen ill in a single week after eating beef.” The culprit? Two new brand-name preservatives at the time that contained formaldehyde as a main ingredient. (p. 61) Truly a fascinating history! So glad we live in the times that we do! Highly recommended read. :-)"
246,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28745526-allie,4,"I came across this book while at the Boston Science museum and knew I had pick it up. It took me several weeks to get through this book but, I still really enjoyed it. This book basically covers the story of Wiley and his fight for food safety regulations. It also discusses the effect politics can have on regulations and consumer protection as well as the creation of the 1906 Pure Food and Drug Act. It is quite alarming to me how we allow politics to impede the creation of regulations to keep people safe. This book provides examples of times when scientists and researchers were providing data about an adulterant saying, ""this can hurt you"" and industry saying, "" no it's fine"" and then politicians agreeing with industry. While we don't want to hurt business and our economy it is important to keep in mind that generally companies in industry are looking out for their own interest. Also I am so grateful for the safety regulations we have now. We don't have to worry about formalin in milk etc. One of my favorite quotes from this book was from Wiley in regards to the purpose of science which is "" to search for truth and thereby to elevate and improve mankind"". "
247,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63521529-beth-menendez,5,"Solid 4.5 stars. I'm dinging it half a star because it is a scince-y book that can get a little dry at times and I think it may lose some readers because of this. However, for anyone who think that the Whole Foods movement and Clean Eating is a new fad, you are gravely mistaken. Deborah Blum does a fantastic job of making Dr. Harvey Washington Wiley come to life. Dr. Washington was the Chief Chemist in the Department of Chemistry and fought for YEARS trying to get congress to approve bills for the Pure Food and Drug movement. Before this movement it was completely legal to add preservatives to food so that spoiled food could then be served to the masses. Yes. Spoiled food. Since mass refrigeration was not really a thing yet, nor was any kind of safety guidelines for chemicals (whether used in food or drugs) all kinds of sketchy things were going on with food for the masses. Milk a little off? No worries, we'll put formaldehyde in it. Oh, was that cow a bit sick? No worries, we'll use some potassium nitrate (saltpeter) to keep it okay. It does not mater that saltpeter will actually kill you. It's cheaper than sodium chloride (table salt) so it's fine. Seriously. The stuff they put in medicines... eek. Just eek. So how does Dr Wiley come in? He began to protest that what manufacturers put in things was deceiving the populations. That maple syrup is not syrup. It's coal tar derived color agents (seriously) and water with a little sugar. Later with a lot of saccharin in it. Because it's cheaper. There were huge arguments over corn syrup as a cheaper additive to foods than sugar. Wait - aren't we STILL arguing about this. Yes, yes we are. After reading this book I am realizing how much has stayed the same and not changed a bit. Oh the topics might be a little different but the court case involving Coca Cola and their ingredients that were both addicting to people and toxic to them that went round and round could be replaced with the energy drinks of today all over the same chemical - caffeine.  The way that what we eat is literally influenced by who is in the White House was a bit of a shock. Dr. Wiley had harder times certain years simply because the president in office elected secretaries that made Dr. Wiley's job almost impossible. The fact that the main secretary to the USDA over him had ties to manufacturing making his job nearly impossible at the end of his term could have read like it was happening today. Upton Sinclair's book The Jungle was more than just a novel - it was a whistle blowing land mine that showed many what was going on with the ""food"" we eat. Even with that book selling thousands of copies there was much attempt to discredit Sinclair which were eventually successful because Sinclair was a socialist - he just wanted everyone to get a fair (clean healthy) shake. Manufacturers and lobbyists were not about to let this happen and so he became a pariah in Washington.  The one thing that resounded throughout the book is how much we fight over the minutiae until there is a national epidemic sadly has not changed. The 1906 original Pure Foods bill (Dr Wiley's bill) came into effect after many children died from the formaldehyde in the milk after YEARS of dying on the floor of Congress. The 1938 bill that beefed (no pun intended) up the bill came about after many children died from taking cough syrup that had been made with sweetened with diethylene glycol (antifreeze). Similar bills were passed in 1956 and 1971 after injury to women and children. Why do I mention this? Because we are STILL fighting this battle - remember when there was salmonella in the peanut butter? Remember how no one could eat salad last Thanksgiving because of E.Coli? Yes, we are still fighting getting clean, pure food from manufacturers. If that is not scary I cannot think what is. Before we look at the past with rose colored glasses we need to realize that the fight for balance of what is actually good for us and what can be had cheaply is still going on. For this reason alone, I highly recommend this book. "
248,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63970501-maureen-caupp,4,"A very interesting read about the work done at the turn of the twentieth century by the United States Department of Agriculture to determine the contents of food and drinks, the impacts of the added compounds on health, and the continuing battle to regulate harmful additives and require truthful labeling. At the turn of the century food manufactures used dangerous preservatives such as formaldehyde in dairy and meats to cover up already spoiling products. Manufactures also used cheap synthetic dyes and flavorings to cut costs. For example ketchup often didn't have tomatoes and strawberry jam didn't contain strawberries. Instead both were any available food scraps left over (pumpkin rinds, apple cores and skins, etc.) dyed red.This book focuses on the efforts of the chief chemist at the USDA for over 30 years around the turn of the century who worked tirelessly and was a strong advocate for regulation and accurate labeling. It also goes into some of the legal battles involved in regulating additives to food and drink. Just like today whenever any regulating legislation managed to get passed into law manufactures pushed back to weaken the new laws. "

My coworker, now my manager, requested the library purchase it, and they did! So she borrowed it and said it was fascinating.Then when it came out in paperback, both blogs again ran blurbs, and I checked it out.I would consider this a must-read book. It details so much about common assumptions of the public, government, and business, and WHY government is absolutely essential to putting roadblocks into the path of capitalism.Some might say that the book bogs down a bit when it details all the different shit (sometimes literally) the Bureau of Chemistry was finding in food products, but it never repeated itself, and it honestly could have gone on forever. The borax, the salicylic acid, the lead, it just never stopped coming. The rise of industrial chemistry, while ultimately a good thing, makes me shiver in fear at what it would have been like to have been alive then.Absolutely loved the epilogue where the author warns against this presidential administration pointing out that it directly mirrors what Harvey Washington Wiley was up against.Those who are not students of history are condemned to repeat the past, indeed."

It is essential to understand that throughout time, industry/corporations in masse have actively fought against protecting individuals if they perceived the requested change would have a negative impact on their profit. These corporations have expended significant revenue to market the political idea of the deregulation of all the things. This book is a great example of why, as a society, there is a necessity for many of the existing regulations. It also does a good job of highlighting corporations and individuals who were open to change and saw the value in a pure food movement and how it could be economically and socially beneficial. Personally, I think I should have read this slower and just read a chapter here and there. To some extent, the chapters and build up were formulaic and came off as a tad dense. This is likely because the majority of the book discussed how a food or beverage was adulterated and the steps taken to stop the incorrect labeling or toxic additives. The adulterations were often similar and the process of fighting the deceptions would be similar, ie. education of the public and the attempt to pass laws to prohibit the additives or mislabeling. Due to the somewhat repetitive nature, I think I would have liked to spread out this book. With that said, I still enjoyed this read and recommend it!

261,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10367651-wade,5," This is a well researched non fiction book that focuses on the work of chemist Dr. Harvey Wiley to bring purity to our food products. The time period here is the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. You will not believe the stuff they put in food as dyes, preservatives and fillers - many of which were toxic. (formaldehyde and lead based chemicals etc.) Dr. Wiley must fight not only the food industry but also the Secretary of Agriculture who is in bed with them. Very enlightening. "

If I had read this via book it would have taken me forever as I read, stopped, re-read, pondered, and looked up things. I have food allergies so I have to read EVERY label. Thank goodness I can. Today we still debate over what is safe for us to eat. I could get on my soapbox and talk about food but I won’t. I will suggest you pick up this book and rethink what you think you eat. "

264,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2404655-melissa,5,This was fascinating (and horrifying/disgusting) discussion of post industrial America and the food industry pre- regulations. 
265,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6293008-filippe,5,"“The Shutdown is Bad For Anyone Who Eats Food”, says Stephen Colbert on Friday, January 11. “Don't Panic: The Government Shutdown Isn't Making Food Unsafe”, counters NPR’s Dan Charles on Weekend Update the following morning.It’s 2019, but you’d be forgiven for thinking of pre-1906 America after reading this wonderful account of the U.S. “pure food movement” and its most steadfast defender and all-around gadfly, chemist Harvey W. Wiley, a man I’d heard nothing about before. As in all of her previous books, Blum’s conversational tone belies meticulous research and attention to detail. Each chapter, charmingly epigraphed with a line or verse from a poem by Wiley himself, is filled with quotations from primary sources; ancillary characters are given their due. Decades of political warfare and industry opposition to pure-food-and-drug laws (familiar names such as Monsanto, Dow Chemical, and Coca-Cola all make unflattering appearances) are richly described.The hand-wringing ineffectiveness of early enforcement, endless concessions to regulation-hating manufacturers, conflicts of interest, and downright corruption in the Department of Agriculture and elsewhere are frustrating, unsurprising, and terribly modern, but I sometimes found myself equally exasperated by Wiley’s crusader-style single-mindedness (that word’s in the title for a reason).I do wish the book had focused more on Wiley’s later-life work with Good Housekeeping Laboratories and covered a bit more of the history of the Food and Drug Administration (newly founded at the book’s close and Wiley’s death in 1930). I wish Wiley’s work and that of the pure-food defenders was not still under continuous undermining more than a century later, as the Epilogue notes. And, tangentially, I would love to read a similar biography/history of Frances Oldham Kelsey’s half-century of work at the FDA. What a lovely parallel (or sequel) that would make."

269,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76170804-judy-monchuk,4,"What a fascinating and frightening read. This history of the fight for food safety laws in the United States is a disturbing page-turner that literally kept me up at night because I didn’t want to put it down.As food manufacturers in the late 19th century embraced chemicals as preservatives, sweeteners or colourants to keep food bright and tasty, they were under no obligation to tell customers what was in their milk or meat, coffee or candy. Whiskey might not even be whiskey. Children died after drinking “chemically improved” milk, canned meat sent to soldiers fighting in the Spanish-American war was described as “embalmed beef.” Formaldehyde was used to deal with the sour taste of milk and extend its life, while chalk was added to whiten it. Borax improved the taste of rancid butter, candy was coloured with poisonous dyes that included arsenic or lead. Saccharine (marketed by Monsanto more than a century ago) presented a health risk if consumed in large enough doses, which was likely because it was an unlabelled sweetener in many products: from soft drinks to jam to canned vegetables. There was no requirement for any food to be or even include what it said it was. Spices could be predominantly anything but the pepper or ginger promised on the bottle, which may include burned shells, charcoal and even floor sweepings. Honey was often tinted corn syrup, tea leaves may not be tea and “fraud was not just pervasive; it was standard practice.”Any effort to introduce safety testing or require a breakdown of ingredients was met with sharp resistance from industry, which often received a sympathetic ear in the White House across a handful of administrations. At the dawn of the 20th century, the manufacturer of a formaldehyde-infused preservative called Freezine argued that the public should just embrace whatever chemicals prevented food decay without question, noting “I wish to say that every one of us eats embalmed meat and we know it and we like it.” Weaving all of this together is a biography of chemist Dr. Harvey Wiley, who refused to back down in his quest for consumer protection. Wiley, chief chemist for the US Department of Agriculture, spent decades fighting for regulations, investigation and even basic labelling to inform consumers what was their food or drinks. The Pure Food and Drug Act, passed in 1906, was known to many as “Dr. Wiley’s law” although he is largely a footnote in history today. In his later years, Wiley was bitter about the struggle and the constant pushback from industry for any regulation. Pulitzer Prize-winning science journalist Deborah Blum has done a fabulous job of bringing this era to life and outlining the challenges facing Wiley and others who tried to spotlight the importance of food safety. It’s rare to celebrate the efforts of a civil servant, especially where those who work for the public good are often painted by politicians as an impediment to business, a consideration spelled out in Wiley’s day. It’s also very true in the 21st century, where the current president vowed to eliminate any regulation that kills jobs. The Poison Squad: One Chemist's Single-Minded Crusade for Food Safety at the Turn of the Twentieth Century is a first-rate thriller. 4.5 stars."
270,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72623806-nicholle,5,"I give this book 5 stars (out of 5). I loved the science/chemistry and history behind the story. The author is an excellent science writer and wrote such an intriguing story. The parts where she described the politics behind the story were boring to me (I cannot stand politics), but a necessary evil in order to describe how the story played out. This story is about chemist Dr. Harvey Washington Wiley and how he wanted to make sure that all food was safe, or at least labeled, from adulterants. Such adulterants were arsenic, dyes from coal tar, and boric acid (or borax), just to name a few. He was truly a man ahead of his time because during a time where most individuals (and even companies) were ignorant of science and most companies producing food only cared about making a profit, he strove to make sure food was safe from unnecessary additives (or adulterants) by actually testing the additives to prove that they were in fact harmful to people.Dr. Wiley set up experiments to feed a group of individuals adulterants, such as boric acid, by comparing that group against a control group not being fed adulterants. The data he and his team of chemists generated was not only rigorous and scientific, but also proved his hypothesis that the adulterants being added to food were in fact harmful to people. Taking this data a step further, he extrapolated that if these adulterants were harmful to healthy (male) adults, these adulterants were even more harmful to babies, children, and the elderly. Dr. Wiley fought almost his whole career against the politics of the unscrupulous lobby behind the companies making the adulterated foods. What I found so fascinating was that among the few companies that did mass produce food without adulterants was the company that made Heinz ketchup. The owner behind the ketchup not only wanted to make food without adulterants, but he also wanted to prove that making unadulterated food could be profitable, since that was the main argument behind the companies that adulterated food was that they could not be profitable. What I truly loved about Dr. Wiley was his desire to speak up about the chemistry behind the adulterants, without dumbing it down, to women. He wrote countless articles in magazines and publications geared towards women. He knew that getting women (who make up 50% of the population) on board with his cause would only further his fight in the political arena to achieve his goals. Dr. Wiley even married a suffragist and supported her desire to be jailed for her fight for women to vote.Another aspect I found so fascinating about this book is the role the government needs to play to protect the average American, or consumer, from unregulated business that cares more about profit than the health of the consumer by taking shortcuts. While I read this book the government shut down was occurring. And it also seems the trend in the current administration is to cozy up to big business that may or may not care about the average American consumer in their bottom line. Only time will tell if this is occurring, and unfortunately as history does repeat itself, who (and how many) will have to get sick and or die before government steps in to protect the average American consumer? "
271,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56837139-brandon-polzin,3,"This book was an enjoyable narrative about a story that I never thought I would be interested in. The topic of food safety is a vitally important one, and I am grateful that a person like Harvey Washington Wiley had a lifelong goal of supporting food transparency for the benefit of the United States' citizens. I am a sucker for the time period in American History that a large portion of this book is set in, as Theodore Roosevelt is one of my favorite historical figures. He is painted as a protagonist in most of the other books that I've read, so it was amusing to see him portrayed in an antagonistic light here.All that being said, I felt this book had a few shortcomings. I may be spoiled after reading biographical narratives by Siddharta Mukherjee and Edmund Morris, but I felt illustrative descriptions of characters and settings were lacking in this book. I certainly was never bored, but it lacked the fiction-like and seemingly whimsical appeal of other critically acclaimed nonfiction narratives. It may be, though, that the nature of this story was not as exciting as those I am comparing it to, so I don't want to place the blame solely on Blum's shoulders.Another issue I had was the intermittent lack of focus/mislabeling of the book. The subtitle of the book (""One Chemist's...) implies that it is a biography about one man, that man being the aforementioned Wiley. Blum went into great detail about him, but would then move on to other parallel stories that coincided with the progression of food safety within the United States. This was obviously all relevant to the overarching story the book was trying to tell, but because of the excessive breaks from Wiley I felt this book should have been explicitly marketed as a story of food safety as a whole, not JUST as a narrative about Wiley. It's a nitpicky criticism, but I found myself being taken out of the story and thinking about it as I read the book.All in all though, I would recommend this book. I love that there was a ""cast of characters"" in the beginning to reference to whenever I forgot about a person's name or their significance. I also loved they way Blum used the story of food safety in the USA to emphasize the control that big business has over the way consumers act and think as a whole, and the importance of a dissenting opinion when everyone is all too eager to comply.I would rate this book a 3.5 if I could, but I'll round up because I'm feeling nice. I hope you can get your hands on a copy sometime soon!"
272,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1468458-lisa,4,"So why do they bleach flour? Read this and you will find out and probably never buy bleached flour again. Having worked in QA in the pharmaceutical industry, I was familiar with the Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906 as the beginning of the regulation of pharmaceuticals, but hadn't really known that its major impetus was on food and I had never heard of the man who had such a big part of making it law, Dr. Harvey Washington Wiley. It was not just unclean production practices that put the food supply at risk of contamination. The dangers included what was purposefully added like heavy metal and coal tar food dyes, especially in candy; formaldehyde in meat and milk; preservatives that had never been tested for safety of human consumption; sugar replacements that had no caloric value; and other fillers added just to improve the profit margin. Some of these additives were even marketed to grocers and food producers solely based on their ability to be undetected and increase profitability by dilution of the actual food product or by masking spoilage. People were literally being killed by the food they ate. The book details just how adulterated our food supply was prior to this act, how much industry worked to keep it that way, how much politicians were unconcerned about the health and welfare of the common person, and how hard Dr. Wiley had to work to protect consumers. Some things never really change and the parallels to our modern world are easy to see. Industry does not, never has, and never will self-regulate if it means less profitability. There were some good guy manufacturers who were promoting pure food, such as H.J. Heinz Company, but they were the rare exception. Some of these same companies that were willingly putting our health at risk over 100 years ago are still in business: Armour, Swift, Coca-cola, Monsanto, McCormick. Despite the debt we owe him and his Poison Squad volunteers, they and Dr. Wiley have mostly been forgotten today. This book attempts to correct that. I fully appreciated the inclusion of historic photos, political cartoons, and food ads. It was especially gratifying to see the woman working in the chemistry lab in the early 1900's. Deborah Blum also includes Dr. Wiley's wife, Anna Kelton Wiley, who was one of the suffragists jailed by President Wilson. Are these hints at a future book on the womens' suffrage movement? I could completely see how this book could be born out of the research from ""The Poisoner's Handbook"" due to the pure whiskey issue. "
273,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71163840-steven-meyers,5,"If you are under the impression that food was awesome back in the “good ole days,” then, man oh man, Ms. Blum’s book will relieve you of that misconception. ‘The Poison Squad’ shows how business greed and political chicanery worked hand-in-hand to place private interests over consumer safety. As the author states, “Fraud was not just pervasive, it was standard practice.” The decades-long fight over supplying consumers with information about what is in their food and the toxic dangers in it was enlightening but discouraging to read. Ms. Blum is a highly respected author who has written numerous books in the field of science. Her writing style is direct and easy to understand. The years covered are from 1844 through 1938. Buckle up, you’re in for a illuminating scary ride. During the mid-1800s, manufacturers and food processors discovered certain inexpensive chemicals could imitate foods and hide unhealthy diseased meats or other perishable products. Factory environments were hellholes, riddled with unsafe and unclean practices. Into this business atmosphere came Harvey Washington Wiley, a government chemist, who began experiments on the quality of foods, exposed business deceptions, and made the public aware of what their families were eating and drinking. Needless to say, company feces hit the fan big time. While Ms. Blum does center the book on Mr. Wiley’s actions, a plethora of other food safety advocates and detractors are also explained. During his three decades crusading against business chicanery he became a very popular and widely loved individual by the general public. Politicians and businessmen, however, would have liked nothing better than for Mr. Wiley to wind up in a can of corned beef or be fired. I never heard of the guy until I picked up ‘The Poison Squad.’ ‘The Poison Squad’ shows that there were responsible high-minded corporations such as Heinz who practiced and advocated for safe foods and there were plenty of nasty ones such as Monsanto who aggressively fought to allow their “additives” to remain in the market. The way companies acted about possibly having to supply consumers with ingredient information so they could make more informed choices, you’d think it was the next thing to Armageddon. It would be naïve to believe that those awful days are completely gone and corporations now place consumer safety over greed. Sure, like yesteryear, there are businesses that are good corporate stewards but like the old Russian proverb we should, “Trust but verify” before embracing a business’s assertions, especially when it comes to consumer safety. Greed has not somehow magically disappeared. In the author’s epilogue she states, “The story of consumer protection in the United States is often to story of a country playing defense, an account of government regulators waking up, time and time again, to yet another public health crisis.” In other words, once a sizable number of consumers bite the dust and it gets enough press exposure, then politicians and government act. Compared to the time period covered in the book, food safety has greatly improved. However, many businesses still focus on profit over public welfare is still very much with us. Ms. Blum has, yet again, written another highly informative work. Read it and weep."
274,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2125854-becca-younk,3,"I loved The Poisoner's Handbook, so of course I had to read this when I spied it on display at the library. It's not quite as good, but still a compelling and interesting read. It's a bit scary to think about all the ingredients listed on labels that I wouldn't even be able to guess what they are, but at least they're listed! I can google them if I'm so inclined. Whereas previously, food manufacturers could just throw in basically whatever they wanted. The book follows Dr. Wiley at the Agriculture Department as he conducts studies in an effort to pass a Pure Food law. Dr. Wiley sounds great, he ends up marrying a suffragette, which is cool. I think where this book sort of falls flat is all the emphasis on the trials and the inner workings of the Department and politicians. It's interesting for awhile, and then gets a bit tedious and feels a little too much like office drama. While The Poisoner's Handbook gives specific examples of how poisons killed people, this book tends to just list deaths or illnesses as numbers. ""100 children died from such-and-such in Indiana"" type of thing, without going into detail. Food safety isn't as shocking as poisons, sure, but I wish there were more human impact stories. ""Cure-all"" medications are briefly mentioned, and it makes me wonder if Blum will write an entire book on those. Crossing my fingers she does, because that would be fascinating. Twice in the book Blum writes Midland, Michigan, as Midlands, Michigan. Once I can believe is a typo. But twice? It takes two seconds of googling to find that the headquarters of Dow is in Midland, no 's.' I find I'm very annoyed by the lack of caring to get a city name correct. Is publishing in such a bad state that there are no editors?"
275,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4454466-amy,5,"Firstly, I think there should be a law enacted declaring that Deborah Blum must author all history/non-fiction books for popular culture. She has an incredible talent for writing history and, in particular, making the areas of scientific history unbelievably exciting!After thoroughly enjoying her other book, The Poisoner’s Handbook, several years back, I was eager to pick up another one by her. The Poison Squad explores the unique history of food safety laws in the U.S. and the influence of historical figures on the creation of the Food Safety and Drug Administration — specifically Upton Sinclair’s The Jungle and Harvey Washington Wiley, the famous 19th century chemist who identified poisons in everyday manufactured foods we love to eat. The author also provides intriguing cases of food poisoning scandals by manufactured foods throughout the 19th and early 20th century. For example, in June 1899, the city of Cincinnati had to warn its citizens of an epidemic of stomach problems following the consumption of “embalmed” beef. “More than one thousand people had fallen ill in a single week after eating beef.” The culprit? Two new brand-name preservatives at the time that contained formaldehyde as a main ingredient. (p. 61) Truly a fascinating history! So glad we live in the times that we do! Highly recommended read. :-)"
276,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28745526-allie,4,"I came across this book while at the Boston Science museum and knew I had pick it up. It took me several weeks to get through this book but, I still really enjoyed it. This book basically covers the story of Wiley and his fight for food safety regulations. It also discusses the effect politics can have on regulations and consumer protection as well as the creation of the 1906 Pure Food and Drug Act. It is quite alarming to me how we allow politics to impede the creation of regulations to keep people safe. This book provides examples of times when scientists and researchers were providing data about an adulterant saying, ""this can hurt you"" and industry saying, "" no it's fine"" and then politicians agreeing with industry. While we don't want to hurt business and our economy it is important to keep in mind that generally companies in industry are looking out for their own interest. Also I am so grateful for the safety regulations we have now. We don't have to worry about formalin in milk etc. One of my favorite quotes from this book was from Wiley in regards to the purpose of science which is "" to search for truth and thereby to elevate and improve mankind"". "
277,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63521529-beth-menendez,5,"Solid 4.5 stars. I'm dinging it half a star because it is a scince-y book that can get a little dry at times and I think it may lose some readers because of this. However, for anyone who think that the Whole Foods movement and Clean Eating is a new fad, you are gravely mistaken. Deborah Blum does a fantastic job of making Dr. Harvey Washington Wiley come to life. Dr. Washington was the Chief Chemist in the Department of Chemistry and fought for YEARS trying to get congress to approve bills for the Pure Food and Drug movement. Before this movement it was completely legal to add preservatives to food so that spoiled food could then be served to the masses. Yes. Spoiled food. Since mass refrigeration was not really a thing yet, nor was any kind of safety guidelines for chemicals (whether used in food or drugs) all kinds of sketchy things were going on with food for the masses. Milk a little off? No worries, we'll put formaldehyde in it. Oh, was that cow a bit sick? No worries, we'll use some potassium nitrate (saltpeter) to keep it okay. It does not mater that saltpeter will actually kill you. It's cheaper than sodium chloride (table salt) so it's fine. Seriously. The stuff they put in medicines... eek. Just eek. So how does Dr Wiley come in? He began to protest that what manufacturers put in things was deceiving the populations. That maple syrup is not syrup. It's coal tar derived color agents (seriously) and water with a little sugar. Later with a lot of saccharin in it. Because it's cheaper. There were huge arguments over corn syrup as a cheaper additive to foods than sugar. Wait - aren't we STILL arguing about this. Yes, yes we are. After reading this book I am realizing how much has stayed the same and not changed a bit. Oh the topics might be a little different but the court case involving Coca Cola and their ingredients that were both addicting to people and toxic to them that went round and round could be replaced with the energy drinks of today all over the same chemical - caffeine.  The way that what we eat is literally influenced by who is in the White House was a bit of a shock. Dr. Wiley had harder times certain years simply because the president in office elected secretaries that made Dr. Wiley's job almost impossible. The fact that the main secretary to the USDA over him had ties to manufacturing making his job nearly impossible at the end of his term could have read like it was happening today. Upton Sinclair's book The Jungle was more than just a novel - it was a whistle blowing land mine that showed many what was going on with the ""food"" we eat. Even with that book selling thousands of copies there was much attempt to discredit Sinclair which were eventually successful because Sinclair was a socialist - he just wanted everyone to get a fair (clean healthy) shake. Manufacturers and lobbyists were not about to let this happen and so he became a pariah in Washington.  The one thing that resounded throughout the book is how much we fight over the minutiae until there is a national epidemic sadly has not changed. The 1906 original Pure Foods bill (Dr Wiley's bill) came into effect after many children died from the formaldehyde in the milk after YEARS of dying on the floor of Congress. The 1938 bill that beefed (no pun intended) up the bill came about after many children died from taking cough syrup that had been made with sweetened with diethylene glycol (antifreeze). Similar bills were passed in 1956 and 1971 after injury to women and children. Why do I mention this? Because we are STILL fighting this battle - remember when there was salmonella in the peanut butter? Remember how no one could eat salad last Thanksgiving because of E.Coli? Yes, we are still fighting getting clean, pure food from manufacturers. If that is not scary I cannot think what is. Before we look at the past with rose colored glasses we need to realize that the fight for balance of what is actually good for us and what can be had cheaply is still going on. For this reason alone, I highly recommend this book. "
278,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63970501-maureen-caupp,4,"A very interesting read about the work done at the turn of the twentieth century by the United States Department of Agriculture to determine the contents of food and drinks, the impacts of the added compounds on health, and the continuing battle to regulate harmful additives and require truthful labeling. At the turn of the century food manufactures used dangerous preservatives such as formaldehyde in dairy and meats to cover up already spoiling products. Manufactures also used cheap synthetic dyes and flavorings to cut costs. For example ketchup often didn't have tomatoes and strawberry jam didn't contain strawberries. Instead both were any available food scraps left over (pumpkin rinds, apple cores and skins, etc.) dyed red.This book focuses on the efforts of the chief chemist at the USDA for over 30 years around the turn of the century who worked tirelessly and was a strong advocate for regulation and accurate labeling. It also goes into some of the legal battles involved in regulating additives to food and drink. Just like today whenever any regulating legislation managed to get passed into law manufactures pushed back to weaken the new laws. "

IS A MANIFESTO.I follow the two blogs, Barf Blog and Food Safety News, at work, and when this book was published, both of them published blurbs on it, suggesting it was a good read. My coworker, now my manager, requested the library purchase it, and they did! So she borrowed it and said it was fascinating.Then when it came out in paperback, both blogs again ran blurbs, and I checked it out.I would consider this a must-read book. It details so much about common assumptions of the public, government, and business, and WHY government is absolutely essential to putting roadblocks into the path of capitalism.Some might say that the book bogs down a bit when it details all the different shit (sometimes literally) the Bureau of Chemistry was finding in food products, but it never repeated itself, and it honestly could have gone on forever. The borax, the salicylic acid, the lead, it just never stopped coming. The rise of industrial chemistry, while ultimately a good thing, makes me shiver in fear at what it would have been like to have been alive then.Absolutely loved the epilogue where the author warns against this presidential administration pointing out that it directly mirrors what Harvey Washington Wiley was up against.Those who are not students of history are condemned to repeat the past, indeed."

Harvey Wiley helped to fight for unadulterated food products, frequently against people in his own agency who bent to the whims of business. Frustrating to see how much hasn't changed."
288,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32057224-grace,3,"I think this is an important read to understand the politics and process behind the eventual creation of the FDA. It is essential to understand that throughout time, industry/corporations in masse have actively fought against protecting individuals if they perceived the requested change would have a negative impact on their profit. These corporations have expended significant revenue to market the political idea of the deregulation of all the things. This book is a great example of why, as a society, there is a necessity for many of the existing regulations. It also does a good job of highlighting corporations and individuals who were open to change and saw the value in a pure food movement and how it could be economically and socially beneficial. Personally, I think I should have read this slower and just read a chapter here and there. To some extent, the chapters and build up were formulaic and came off as a tad dense. This is likely because the majority of the book discussed how a food or beverage was adulterated and the steps taken to stop the incorrect labeling or toxic additives. The adulterations were often similar and the process of fighting the deceptions would be similar, ie. education of the public and the attempt to pass laws to prohibit the additives or mislabeling. Due to the somewhat repetitive nature, I think I would have liked to spread out this book. With that said, I still enjoyed this read and recommend it! If I could I would have given it 3.5 and probably would have been a 4.0 had a read it like I suggested above."

There’s a lot of details as they go through the years but it’s interesting if you like that stuff. Also, there’s a PBS show on this same subject but the the book is much better. The book adds the detail that is lacking in the PBS show. "
291,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10367651-wade,5," This is a well researched non fiction book that focuses on the work of chemist Dr. Harvey Wiley to bring purity to our food products. The time period here is the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. You will not believe the stuff they put in food as dyes, preservatives and fillers - many of which were toxic. (formaldehyde and lead based chemicals etc.) Dr. Wiley must fight not only the food industry but also the Secretary of Agriculture who is in bed with them. Very enlightening. "

If I had read this via book it would have taken me forever as I read, stopped, re-read, pondered, and looked up things. I have food allergies so I have to read EVERY label. Thank goodness I can. Today we still debate over what is safe for us to eat. I could get on my soapbox and talk about food but I won’t. I will suggest you pick up this book and rethink what you think you eat. "

295,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6293008-filippe,5,"“The Shutdown is Bad For Anyone Who Eats Food”, says Stephen Colbert on Friday, January 11. “Don't Panic: The Government Shutdown Isn't Making Food Unsafe”, counters NPR’s Dan Charles on Weekend Update the following morning.It’s 2019, but you’d be forgiven for thinking of pre-1906 America after reading this wonderful account of the U.S. “pure food movement” and its most steadfast defender and all-around gadfly, chemist Harvey W. Wiley, a man I’d heard nothing about before. As in all of her previous books, Blum’s conversational tone belies meticulous research and attention to detail. Each chapter, charmingly epigraphed with a line or verse from a poem by Wiley himself, is filled with quotations from primary sources; ancillary characters are given their due. Decades of political warfare and industry opposition to pure-food-and-drug laws (familiar names such as Monsanto, Dow Chemical, and Coca-Cola all make unflattering appearances) are richly described.The hand-wringing ineffectiveness of early enforcement, endless concessions to regulation-hating manufacturers, conflicts of interest, and downright corruption in the Department of Agriculture and elsewhere are frustrating, unsurprising, and terribly modern, but I sometimes found myself equally exasperated by Wiley’s crusader-style single-mindedness (that word’s in the title for a reason).I do wish the book had focused more on Wiley’s later-life work with Good Housekeeping Laboratories and covered a bit more of the history of the Food and Drug Administration (newly founded at the book’s close and Wiley’s death in 1930). I wish Wiley’s work and that of the pure-food defenders was not still under continuous undermining more than a century later, as the Epilogue notes. And, tangentially, I would love to read a similar biography/history of Frances Oldham Kelsey’s half-century of work at the FDA. What a lovely parallel (or sequel) that would make."

I thought this book was very well researched and well written, but got bogged down by all the political details. The subject matter is fascinating but I think she could've done more focusing on the food and less on the political minutia. "

299,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76170804-judy-monchuk,4,"What a fascinating and frightening read. This history of the fight for food safety laws in the United States is a disturbing page-turner that literally kept me up at night because I didn’t want to put it down.As food manufacturers in the late 19th century embraced chemicals as preservatives, sweeteners or colourants to keep food bright and tasty, they were under no obligation to tell customers what was in their milk or meat, coffee or candy. Whiskey might not even be whiskey. Children died after drinking “chemically improved” milk, canned meat sent to soldiers fighting in the Spanish-American war was described as “embalmed beef.” Formaldehyde was used to deal with the sour taste of milk and extend its life, while chalk was added to whiten it. Borax improved the taste of rancid butter, candy was coloured with poisonous dyes that included arsenic or lead. Saccharine (marketed by Monsanto more than a century ago) presented a health risk if consumed in large enough doses, which was likely because it was an unlabelled sweetener in many products: from soft drinks to jam to canned vegetables. There was no requirement for any food to be or even include what it said it was. Spices could be predominantly anything but the pepper or ginger promised on the bottle, which may include burned shells, charcoal and even floor sweepings. Honey was often tinted corn syrup, tea leaves may not be tea and “fraud was not just pervasive; it was standard practice.”Any effort to introduce safety testing or require a breakdown of ingredients was met with sharp resistance from industry, which often received a sympathetic ear in the White House across a handful of administrations. At the dawn of the 20th century, the manufacturer of a formaldehyde-infused preservative called Freezine argued that the public should just embrace whatever chemicals prevented food decay without question, noting “I wish to say that every one of us eats embalmed meat and we know it and we like it.” Weaving all of this together is a biography of chemist Dr. Harvey Wiley, who refused to back down in his quest for consumer protection. Wiley, chief chemist for the US Department of Agriculture, spent decades fighting for regulations, investigation and even basic labelling to inform consumers what was their food or drinks. The Pure Food and Drug Act, passed in 1906, was known to many as “Dr. Wiley’s law” although he is largely a footnote in history today. In his later years, Wiley was bitter about the struggle and the constant pushback from industry for any regulation. Pulitzer Prize-winning science journalist Deborah Blum has done a fabulous job of bringing this era to life and outlining the challenges facing Wiley and others who tried to spotlight the importance of food safety. It’s rare to celebrate the efforts of a civil servant, especially where those who work for the public good are often painted by politicians as an impediment to business, a consideration spelled out in Wiley’s day. It’s also very true in the 21st century, where the current president vowed to eliminate any regulation that kills jobs. The Poison Squad: One Chemist's Single-Minded Crusade for Food Safety at the Turn of the Twentieth Century is a first-rate thriller. 4.5 stars."
