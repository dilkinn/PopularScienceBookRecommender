0,0465004733,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1713956-manny,5,"I was a biological secret weapon, or, what did you do in the Cold War Daddy?It occurred to me yesterday that, while still a teen, I acted as a guinea-pig in two large social engineering experiments. One of them started when I was about 14, and was concerned with chess. Paul was asking the other day, apropos a Kasparov review, what would have happened if other countries had tried to organise a chess infrastructure similar to the one the Soviet Union built up, and systematically nurtured young talents. In fact, this is exactly what Leonard Barden tried to do between about 1970 and 1980. He studied the Soviet model, and copied it to the best of his ability; there were regular training weekends in London, where all the top British junior players took part. We played a six-round tournament, and between the games you got free coaching from International Master level players. (In those days, an International Master title was worth something; now, if you aren't a Grandmaster you aren't anything). There were lists on the walls, written in green marker pen, showing the top players in each age bracket. After a while, we noticed a young Azerbaijani called Kasparov, who was working his way up the ladder with incredible speed. Even at age 10, he was already on our radar. Barden was a strange, shy, nerdy kind of person, and we all laughed at him behind his back, but I have to give him credit: the program was a stunning success, and made Britain one of the top chess countries throughout the 80s and early 90s. In 1986, England took silver in the Chess Olympiad (the world team championship), and had an excellent shot at gold. Then, in 1993, Nigel Short played Kasparov for the world title. He got creamed, but it was the first time in more than a century that a British player had reached the final. Before I ever got seriously interested in chess, though, I realise now that I was part of another experiment. This time, the key person was Isaac Asimov, like Barden a strange, geeky guy who simply refused to acknowledge what he was up against. In 1957, Asimov was one of the US's most successful science-fiction writers; he'd abandoned a promising career in biochemistry to devote himself to writing SF, and was making more from that than he ever had as an academic. Then Sputnik happened. Asimov saw what he regarded as proof that the US was falling behind in the science race, and decided it was his patriotic duty to help. You could view it as a mild version of Ayn Rand syndrome; Asimov was also born in the Soviet Union and moved to the US, but he did it much younger than Rand, and his hatred for all things Communist was correspondingly less vitriolic. Instead of writing Atlas Shrugged, he decided that he would help educate the next generation of American scientists. He had a simple and effective strategy: he knew about science, and he was a good writer, so he'd use his skills to make science accessible and exciting to young hopefuls.I think he did a good job. I discovered his books around age 9 and I just devoured them, both the science-fiction and the popular science. The Intelligent Man's Guide to Science was one of my favourites, and I read it two or three times. The book has many things that a geeky, precocious kid is going to find seriously cool: for example, he tells you what ""E = mc2"" means, and gives you a reasonable explanation of how to derive the formula. I loved that. But, in retrospect, the most important thing was the way he described the history of science, and how scientific method works. I still vividly recall how impressed I was by his explanation of the 1887 Michelson-Morley experiment, probably the most important experiment done in physics since Newton. If you don't know about it, Michelson and Morley had a clever idea: they would measure the Earth's velocity through space by comparing how quickly light travels in different directions. When light is being beamed in the direction the Earth is moving, its speed should be different from when it's being beamed in the opposite direction. They set up instruments ingeniously calibrated to be able to measure the tiny differences, but came to a shocking conclusion: light always travels at exactly the same speed, regardless of direction. It made no sense, but they were honest enough to report their ""failure"", and it led directly to Einstein's theory of relativity. I wanted to get involved in this story too, and I'm sure Asimov helped nudge me into a scientific careerPutting it together, I am kind of shocked that two weird geeks, Barden and Asimov, were able to recruit me and thousands of other impressionable kids in their bizarre schemes. I must admit that, personally, I didn't turn out to be a very good cold warrior. In chess, I played three top Russians, and lost all three games; at least my loss against former World Champion Smyslov was interesting enough that you'll find it on the Web if you look around. In science, I did end up doing something moderately cool for NASA, but by then the cold war was over, and the US and Russian space programs had merged. However, other people in my cohort were much more successful; basically, I would say that both programs worked, and, if you want to change the world, there's a lesson in this story. Barden and Asimov had very limited resources, but they used them imaginatively and made a difference. The key idea is well-known, but no less effective for that: get them when they're young."
1,0465004733,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1862015-hollis,5,"I had previously avoided Asimov's non-fiction books because he never seems to be mentioned in popular science circles: I assumed that his science was of the ''dumbed-down'' variety. How wrong I was. This book takes a grand Asimovian sweep across the entire world of science and covers every area: no book I have ever read has communicated so vividly the wonder of science as a whole and not simply an area of it such as chemistry or biology. I don't know how many times I found myself thinking ''ah, so that's how it works!'' during the course of reading this. Probably hundreds. The Guide is intended in part as an encyclopedia so you can keep it on your shelf and flick through it if you ever need to find out what a neutrino is or the average distance of Jupiter from the Sun. However, it is so readable that you will want to go through it cover-to-cover, finding out lots of new things you never knew about. Unlike many science writers, he actually explains where words have their origins: for example, why the particle families ''baryons'' and ''leptons'' have those names. I would seriously recommend this to anyone interested in science."
2,0465004733,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6752970-peter,5,"This is, quite possibly, the best history of science ever written. I would recommend the hard cover (1984) edition if you can find it, as the paperback edition that is still in print has slightly fewer pages. I'm not sure if this means it is missing something or not. In any case, the book is a very thorough history of science up to about 1980, with an extensive biographical index and a subject index. I refer back to it all the time when preparing my lectures. The coverage is by subject rather than a chronological account, which I think makes sense given the enormous complexity of the subject. Asimov wrote a surprisingly huge number of non-fiction books in addition to all of his science fiction. I can vouche for the high quality of his coverage in the area of molecular biology where my expertise lies. The best thing of all about Asimov was his ability to explain complicated scientific concepts with a rare combination of ease, clarity, and rigour. "
3,0465004733,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1237540-jim,5,"As a grown up science kid this book was like catnip to me. Asimov fans will clearly recognize the clear, straightforward prose that characterized most of his fiction and virtually all of his non-fiction. I read Volume One of the original 1960 edition of this two-volume work - which covers the ""hard"" sciences - Chemisry, Physics, Astronomy, etc. I was astonished at how well the Good Doctor wove a historical narrative for each discipline - later chapters made frequent reference to earlier ones. I knew perhaps 80% of the science but very little of the history so for me it read like a well-organized, non-linear novel. Dr. Asmiov used no math for this volume, thus making all of the narrative readily accessible to a wide readership. I think if I were a newspaper or magazine editor I would make this required reading for all of my writers.For more detail try this Wikipedia entry:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Inte..."
4,0465004733,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44461229-davejp,3,"This book deserves 4 or 5 stars for it's depth and range. I'm only giving it 3 because it's dated. Published in 1984, this is the 4th version of a book which started life in 1960 as ""The Intelligent Man's (sic) Guide to Science"". Also I personally would deduct a star because I'm not that intelligent! The style is quite readable but the subject matter can get hard going at times. That's hardly Isaac Asimov's fault. Nevertheless, When I read it many years ago I did read it straight through - can't remember how long it took. I've since dipped into it regularly.All in all, I wouldn't want to put anyone off giving this book a try. Well worth the effort.Bill Bryson's ""Short History of Nearly Everything"" must get a mention here as it is equally stunning in its scope. Less detailed and a much easier, conversational style. Have a look at that first and if it's not technical enough for you, try Asimov.Anyone know any other ""popular"" science books covering ""nearly everything""?Dave"
5,0465004733,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2659688-david-bonesteel,5,"In addition to being a legendary science-fiction writer, Isaac Asimov is one of the most successful science popularizers of all time, and this book demonstrates why. In it, he delivers a comprehensive, well-organized, well-written survey of the known sciences as of the time of publication. But, since that time was over twenty years ago, is his book still worth reading today? Of course, it is! This is because Asimov takes a historical approach, first explaining the initial questions that puzzled observers of the natural world, then following the research of talented and brilliant scientists over the centuries that brought us to our present-day understanding. This lends much of the text the fascination of a mystery story, and gives the attentive reader a good basic grounding in the sciences. "
6,0465004733,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1866292-g-branden,4,"Outstanding, if imperfect. But can a book this wide-ranging ever truly be perfect?Reasons for not having five stars:1. It's dated (1984). Almost all of this is still solid but science does march on.2. Very light on geology. He refers to igneous and sedimentary rocks but does not explain how they are different, nor mention the metamorphic type. A bit more coverage of phases of matter, including exotic ones that have been explored better in the years since, and of materials science, would have been helpful.3. Very light on gross anatomy of any species, including humans. I can understand this sacrifice for the sake of scope control. Cellular structures are only mentioned insofar as he needs them for his overall through-line. He mentions mitochondria's synergetic status with (most) eukaryotes but not its distinguishable genetic descent from nuclear DNA. Beyond that, knowledge of gross human anatomy is essentially assumed. That, too, seems fair, but he covers so much other material that seems basic to me that I found it noteworthy.4. Light on mathematics. He mostly gets away with this, but some time spent early on on scientific notation and distinguishing constant vs. linear vs. exponential functions would have paid off well later. Asimov had written at least one excellent essay on the square-cube law that could have been usefully summarized here (he did make reference to the concept). Linear kinematics and special relativity, both of which are accessible to anyone with basic high-school algebra, are covered in the sole appendix.5. He's very good on optical activity (polarization of light by molecules), but Feynman, in his Lectures on Physics, is even better. The key concept which demands emphasis is that photons are absorbed and re-emitted, not simply blocked or reflected. This insight makes circular polarization comprehensible.This has been on my reading list for decades. At last my procrastination ended. Will I finally read the Foundation trilogy?"
7,0465004733,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3394688-pete,5,This is a tremendous read - its depth and breath of coverage is impressive. Highly recommended 
8,0465004733,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20187135-khurram-solangi,4,"Fantastic, abridged chronological history of scientific advancements. "
9,0465004733,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3217989-jared-della-rocca,2,"First of all, this title is hilarious, for the reason that it this fourth edition was written in 1984. So the ""New"" Guide to Science is 30 years old now. Unfortunately, it was the last one he wrote, and so the one I have to utilize for my review. This is not a book meant to be read cover-to-cover. Let me set that out there straightaway, for anyone who thinks this may be an interesting read. It's nearly 900 pages covering approximately 17 major areas of science, and about 100 subcategories. Asimov's brilliance, besides his breadth of knowledge (more on that later), is his ability to boil down topics for easier comprehension. The book, or let's say the individual chapters, rank high for readability. It's more science and less anecdotal than Bill Bryson's, but more anecdotal and less science than Stephen Hawking. I'd suggest this book (or would have at the time of publication) for readers interested in a particular scientific topic, to get an overview of that field. But reading straight through was nearly impossible, and its age has made it a relic.Now, as this is the last of the Asimov books I'm reviewing this year, I just have to say he is one of the most brilliant humans our world has ever seen. While he began his career as one of the greatest science fiction writers ever, he then transitioned to science writing textbooks and then popular science books. He's written popular history, mystery, annotated Don Juan, Gulliver's Travels, and Paradise Lost. To summate, Kurt Vonnegut once asked Asimov, ""How does it feel like to know everything?"""
10,0465004733,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13717595-jake,5,"I find it dumb that this book isnt more well known. The basic idea is a general overview of all of science. Granted, the book would change if it were written now, as there have been many advancements within theoretical physics (e.g. the acceleration of the universe, higgs boson stuff ?! , advancements in particle physics.. stuff I have not even begun to look into), neuroscience, quantum chemistry... etc etc..nevertheless it seems that most of the foundations of modern science have not radically changed, and therefore this book is still very much relevant . I'd take this over bryson's brief history any day. While I enjoyed bryson's book, it was much more revolved around the politics and humor of discovery than about the nitty gritty gears of the universe. Asimov does not shy to splash some data in your face.. for 900 + pages. In short, if you are about to embark upon your education in science and wish to have a general overview, or maybe a review of information you have not looked at for 30 years , this is a great place to go. "
11,0465004733,http://goodreads.com/user/show/92241704-bharath-talluri,4,"A very well written introduction into modern science. The book follows a natural transition between different topics, making it easy to follow. It also lays an adequate emphasis on the history of science. It may feel like an information overload, but by the end, the reader will feel they are familiar with many scientific terms, and interested to dig deeper into some of their favourite topics, and that is the book's greatest success, imo. Suited for people of all age groups, but high school students and early undergrads have the most to benefit."
12,0465004733,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70907778-liedzeit,3,I do not quite like the structure of the book. Historical and systematic at the same time. But Asimov complained there was too much editing/cutting. So I should read the later installments.

I also learned that in the universe there is a center not literaly the center but where the main rotation is which is called the galactic center and in this there are globular lusters meaning pack of stars and they determine there rotation speed by the galactic center meaning its rotation compared to the stars. Finding the velocity of an eliptical stars orbit by the Dopplers theory is called radial velocoty. I also learned that we are in a spiral galaxy because our stars are population 1.I'm on page 266 and I'm learning the starting point of chemistry or it was known back then as alchemy. The starting point meaning have the five earth elements like fire, water, and so forth which water can be broken down to oxygen and hydrogen therefor it's not a element.

Covering the major branches, it attempts to bring the average layperson up to our current scientific understandings. Asimov wanted to write sequels to this book every so often so that it would keep abreast, but unfortunately, he passed away. This book is one of the reasons that I truly miss this author.The closest book I have found to this one is ""A History of Nearly Everything"" by Bill Bryson (also recommended)"
24,0465004733,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1478711-brian,5,"Dr Asimov wrote this book as a way for the average layperson to understand science from its humblest beginnings to where we are at now. The material is dated now, having been written decades ago, but it is still worthwhile. Asimov wrote in an easy way that could simplify complex topics. He was entertaining and could make the driest subject something of interest.I own a hardcover of this book. If you're looking for a book similar to this one, I would recommend Bill Bryson's ""A Short History of Nearly Everything""."
25,0465004733,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6147607-vaibhav-bahadur,4,"The book is great for beginners in science. Even though out-dated in some parts it does provide the comprehensive analysis of science, its theories and its history. It is hard (takes time) to consume but is very interesting. Within those 800 odd pages you cover quite a lote of the known universe and its meaning to the current intellectual human being. It is a book in a story mode (everything is realted) is in continuation and a step by step realization of science."

I found it quite difficult, thinking as a kid that it was because it was hard science, and difficult was good. But I ended up much more skeptical, realizing that I was finding it a slog because I was always arguing with it, unconvinced by its always-politically-correct unscientific pontifications. Meh. I won't be re-reading it anymore, nor recommending it to any smart kids."
