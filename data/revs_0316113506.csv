0,0316113506,http://goodreads.com/user/show/793473-clif-hostetler,5,"Exercise is the single most powerful tool available to optimize brain function. That is the message from this book. Everybody knows that exercise creates a fit body, but what many forget is that the brain is part of the body too. Modern science has been able to learn much about how the brain works, and has even tracked neurogenesis (i.e. new cell growth) in the brain in response to exercise. The old saying, ""Once your brain cells die, they can’t grow back,"" is a myth.This book has chapters about the effect of exercise on learning, stress, anxiety, depression, ADHD, addiction, hormonal changes and aging. The author explains how exercise helps in each condition. Exercise is truly a miracle drug, and you can bet the drug companies are working hard to capture some of its benefits in a pill. But the body's (and brain's) reaction to exercise is so complex, multifaceted and exquisitely balanced as to make it certain to never be fully captured within a pill. It should be no surprise that humans respond positively to exercise. We're descendants of hunter-gatherers who were optimized over thousands of years by evolution to walk and run around the equivalent of many miles per day (i.e. the couch potato of the caveman era died young).I've decided to include in this review more than the usual amount of excerpts from the book for my future reference. I may need this info to motivate myself in the future.This book's focus is exercise, but the author slips a few comments in about nutrition that caught my eye:Low-carb diets may help you lose weight, but they're not good for your brain. Whole grains have complex carbohydrates that supply a steady flow of energy rather than the spike and crash of simple sugars, and they're necessary to transport amino acids such as tryptophan into the brain.The brain is made up of more than 50 percent fat, so fats are important too, as long as they're the right kind. Trans fat, animal fat, and hydrogenated oils gum up the works, but the omega-3s found in fish are enormously beneficial. Population studies have shown that countries in which people eat a lot of fish have lower incidence of bipolar disorder. And some people use omega-3s as a stand-alone treatment for mood disorders and ADHD. One study showed that people who eat fish once a week slow the yearly rate of cognitive decline by 10 percent. The Framingham Heart Study followed nine hundred people for nine years and found that those who ate three meals with fish oil per week were half as likely to develop dementia. Omega-3s lower blood pressure, cholesterol, and neuronal inflammation, and they elevate the immune response and BDNF levels.Because of my age I have particular interest in quotations from the book regarding issues related to aging. The following is an extended excerpt from the book (pages 233-237) where the author summarizes the ways in which exercise mitigates the human aging process.THE LIFE LISTMuch of the public discourse on aging focuses on baby boomers becoming senior citizens and the belief that their vast numbers will take an unprecedented toll on the health care system, in the form of dementia and other costly health problems. But I don’t believe we’re stuck with this picture of doom and gloom. Despite my generation’s familiarity with fast food and pay per view, we also came of age with Kenneth Cooper’s revolutionary concept of aerobics. Unlike previous generations, we recognized how a healthy heart and healthy lungs stave off disease, and we know our way around the gym. My mother just happened to have the good habit of walking, and even Harold, the eighty-year-old skier from Michigan, isn’t terribly well versed in matters of health and fitness. He once asked the trainer June Smedley what was causing a muscle twitch, and when she suggested it might be dehydration, he scoffed, saying, “I drink lots of fluid--coffee, milk and wine!”I have faith that when people come to recognize how their lifestyle can improve their health span--living better, not simply longer--they will, at the very least, be more inclined to stay active. And when they come to accept that exercise is as important for the brain as it is for the heart, they’ll commit to it. Here’s how exercise keeps you going:1. It strengthens the cardiovascular system. A strong heart and lungs reduce resting blood pressure. The result is less strain on the vessels in the body and the brain. There are a number of mechanisms at work here. First, contracting muscles during exercise releases growth factors such as VEGF and fibroblast growth factor (FGF-2). Aside from their role in helping neurons bind and promoting neurogenesis, they trigger a molecular chain reaction that produces endothelial cells, which make up the inner lining of blood vessels and thus are important for building new ones. These inroads expand the vascular network, bringing each area of the brain that much closer to a lifeline and creating redundant circulation routes that protect against future blockages. Second, exercise introduces more nitric oxide, a gas that widens the vessels’ passageways to boost blood volume. Third, the increased blood flow during moderate to intense activity reduces hardening of the brain arteries. Finally, exercise can to some extent counteract vascular damage. Stroke victims and even Alzheimer’s patients who participate in aerobic exercise improve their scores on cognitive tests. Starting when you’re young is best, but it’s never too late. 2. It regulates fuel. Researchers at the Karolinska Institute conducted a nine-year study of 1,173 people over age seventy-five. None of them had diabetes, but those with high glucose levels were 77 percent more likely to develop Alzheimer’s  .As we age, insulin levels drop; and glucose has a harder time getting into the cells to fuel them. Then glucose can skyrocket, which creates waste products in the cells--such as free radicals--and damages blood vessels, putting us at risk for stroke and Alzheimer’s. When everything is balanced, insulin works against the buildup of amyloid plaque, but too much encourages the buildup, as well as inflammation, damaging surrounding neurons.  Exercise increases levels of insullin-like growth factor (IGF-1), which regulates insulin in the body and improves synaptic plasticity in the brain. By drawing down surplus fuel, exercise also bolsters our supply of BDNF, which is reduced by high glucose. 3. It reduces obesity. Aside from wreaking havoc on the cardiovascular and metabolic systems, body fat has its own nasty effects on the brain. The CDC estimates that 73 percent of Americans over sixty-five are overweight, and given the potential problems obesity can lead to--from cardiovascular disease to diabetes--the agency is right in declaring it a pandemic. Simply being overweight doubles the chances of developing dementia, and if we factor in high blood pressure and high cholesterol--symptoms that often come along with obesity--the risk increases sixfold. When people retire, they figure they deserve a break after working their whole lives, and they start piling on the food. but what they don’t realize is that having dessert with every meal is no treat. Exercise, naturally, counteracts obesity on two fronts: it burns calories, and it reduces appetite. 4. It elevates your stress threshold. Exercise combats the corrosive effects of too much cortisol, a product of chronic stress that can bring on depression and dementia. It also bolsters neurons against excess glucose, free radicals, and the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate, all necessary, but they can damage cells if left unchecked. Waste accumulates and junks up the cellular machinery, and it starts turning out dangerous products--damaged proteins and broken fragments of DNA that trigger that latent and ultimately inevitable process of cell death that defines aging. Exercise makes proteins that fix the damage and delay the process.  5. It lifts your mood. More neurotransmitters, neurotrophins, and connectivity shore up the hippocampus against the atrophy associated with depression and anxiety. And a number of studies have shown that keeping our mood up reduces our chances of developing dementia. The evidence applies not only to clinical depression but also to general attitude. Staying mobile also allows us to stay involved, keep up with people, and make new friends; social connections are important in elevating and sustaining mood. 6. It boosts in immune system. Stress and age depress the immune response, and exercise strengthens it directly in two important ways. First, even moderate activity levels rally the immune system’s antibodies and lymphocytes, which you probably know as T cells. Antibodies attack bacterial and viral infections, and having more T cells make the body more alert to the development of conditions such a s cancer. Population studies bear this out: The most consistent risk factor for cancer is lack of activity. Those who are physically active, for instance, have a 50 percent lower chance of developing colon cancer.  Second, part of the immune system’s job is to activate cells that fix damaged tissue. When it’s out of whack, these damaged spots fester, and you’re left with chronic inflammation. This is why, if you’re over fifty, your blood will be tested for C-reactive proteins as part of your standard physical. These proteins are a sign of chronic Alzheimer’s. Exercise brings the immune system back into equilibrium so it can sop inflammation and combat disease. 7. It fortifies your bones. Osteoporosis doesn’t have much to do with the brain, but it’s important to mention because you need a strong carriage to continue exercising as you age, and it is a largely preventable disease.  Osteoporosis afflicts twenty million women and two million men in this country. More women every year die from hip fractures--a vulnerability of osteoporosis--than from breast cancer. Women reach peak bone mass at around thirty, and after that they lose about 1 percent a year until menopause, when the pace doubles. The result is that by age sixty, about 30 percent of a woman’s bone mass has disappeared. Unless, that is, she takes calcium and vitamin D (which comes free with ten minutes of morning sun a day) and does some form of exercise or strength training to stress the bones. Walking doesn’t quite do the job--save that for later in life. But as a young adult, weight training or any sport that involves running or jumping will counteract the natural loss. the degree to which you can prevent the loss is impressive: one study found that women can double their leg strength in just a few months of weight training. Even women in their nineties can improve their strength and prevent this heartbreaking disease. 8. It boosts motivation. The road to successful aging really begins with desire, because without the desire to stay engaged and active ad alive, people quickly fall into the death trap of being sedentary and solitary. One of the problems of getting older is the lack of challenges, but with exercise we can continually improve and push ourselves.  Exercise counteracts the natural decline of dopamine, the key neurotransmitter in the motivation and motor systems. When you move, you’re inherently boosting motivation by strengthening the connections between dopamine neurons, while at the same time guarding against Parkinson’s. This really underscores the idea that if you’re not busy living, your body will be busy dying. It’s important to have plans and goals and appointments, and this is why sports such as golf and tennis are great. They require constant self-monitoring and the motivation to improve. 9. It fosters neuroplasticity. The best way to guard against neurodegenerative diseases is to build a strong brain. Aerobic exercise accomplishes this by strengthening connections between your brain cells, creating more synapses to expand the web of connections, and spurring newly born stem cells to divide and become functional neurons in the hippocampus. Moving the body keeps the brain growing by elevating the supply of neurotrophic factors necessary for neuroplasticity and neurogenesis, which should otherwise naturally diminish with age. Contracting your muscles releases factors such as VEGF, FGF-2, and IGF-1 that make their way from the body into the brain and aid in the process. All these structural changes improve your brain’s ability to learn and remember, execute higher thought processes, and manage your emotions. The more robust the connections, the better prepared your brain will be to handle and damage it might experience.   I don't think it's necessary to understand what all those terms mean, but if they bother you it's possible to Google them in most cases.The following quote is about the relationship between exercise and dementia.Population studies support the evidence that exercise holds off dementia. In one about 1500 people from Finland originally surveyed in the 1970s and again 21 years later when they were between 65 and 79 years old. Those who had exercised at least twice a week were 50% less likely to have dementia. What's particularly interesting is that the relationship between regular activity and the onset of dementia was even more pronounced among those carrying the ApoE4 gene. The researchers suggest that one explanation might be that their brains neuro-protective systems are naturally compromised by the gene variant making life style particularly important. The bottom line ... is that all we can do at the present time is modify the environmental factors to get the best out of the whatever genes we have.My only disappointment with the book is that it doesn't say that writing long book reviews is good for the brain."
1,0316113506,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3843117-ensiform,2,"The author attempts to explain for the layman, but ends up using masses of neurological jargon and acronyms, about the role exercise plays in sharpening our mental processes. Boiling it down to the basics: moving our muscles produces proteins that play roles in neurogenesis and the repair of synapses. It also helps the production of hormones such as serotonin and norepinephrine that regulate mood. Therefore, Ratey argues, daily sustained aerobic exercise is a sure cure-all for depression, ADHD, the ravages of aging, raging hormones in menopausal women, addiction, phobias, etc.He makes his point with study after study, but this certainly could have been a more readable book. First, as noted, Ratey can’t help using baffling medical jargon like LTP (long-term potentiation, or the ability to attach synapses), BDNF (a protein that strengthens brain cells), cortisol, dendrite, VEGF (growth factor), all of which is overwhelming for the average reader. Some of it could easily have been skipped to no detriment to the argument. Second, he then becomes repetitive. In each chapter, he explains how studies show that movement elevates these receptors, factors, and proteins; but really, once is enough. I think the book would have been improved had it had an introductory chapter that showed the hard science, then focused on case studies, for example, only making passing references to the science chapter as needed. Instead, Ratey seems to think he must explain the biological processes each time. Third, he comes off as a zealot, and he has the unfortunate blinders of a zealot: he recommends, without fail, 45 minutes of sustained aerobic activity four days a week, two days of intensive aerobic activity, with focus on strength training, balance, new skill sets (so karate or yoga rather than just running), and social interaction. Yes, I’m sure that would be fantastic, but it’s preposterously unrealistic for the average American, let alone one recovering from addiction or depression. Certainly, Ratey notes often enough that people should start out slow, consult their doctor, and so on, but it’s clear he has no patience for anything but the highest level of activity, and devotes almost no space to developing a slow, reasonable build-up to fitness. The information is good and the science interesting, and Ratey may be perfectly reliable, but the tone of his book is something like that of a cult member or a car salesman. "
2,0316113506,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1838482-nicole,3,"This book gets a bit repetitive after awhile (I quit after reading about 3/4 of it), and the conclusions he drew from some of the research studies seemed to really be stretching what you could reasonably conclude from the actual results.But it did convince me that I had to start exercising after being pretty sedentary for the last 4 or 5 years. And six months later, I'm still convinced and still exercising...so I guess it had a bigger positive impact on my life than most things I read. "
3,0316113506,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3014030-vivian,5,"If you're the kind of person who needs to be intellectually convinced by mountains of research to confirm something you already know - as I am - and you're trying desperately to start a regular exercise habit - as I am - you need to run and get this book, like, yesterday. I'm actually very serious: I have a very athletic husband, who is the epitome of healthy living, as an example in front of me every day; I've read tons of articles about the benefits of exercise, and have known for practically my whole life the importance of getting my body moving. But my mind resisted, and has just never really gotten with the program, so to speak...Between another book I've read recently, about outwitting your resistant mind (""Mini-Habits""), and this book, which goes into fascinating detail about the importance of exercise for absolutely everyone, I think I'm finally starting to be willing to ""drink the Koolaid."" I think the way Ratey has organized the book, with an opening about the life-changing results of exercise for high school kids, to chapters discussing the advantages of exercise for many different conditions - including anxiety, ADHD, depression, addiction, menopause and aging - there is really something in here for everyone. I could think of at least five family members, myself included, who could benefit from reading this book, and since every family has medical conditions that exercise could most certainly help, the information given here is worth reading by anyone who wants to be happier and, most importantly, healthier. I'm sold. Very highly recommended. "

Well, 'Spark' dives deeper and attempts to find out the effect of exercise on the brain. The book provides a detailed explanation of how different parts of the brain work on a biological level to carry out the everyday functions and what part of the brain is responsible for different tasks. We get to learn how the brain is able to function at a cellular level like how the neurons communicate with each other to carry the signal that governs our actions. It was interesting to know how the role of different neurotransmitters and how exercise helps to balance them out.If you’re a sucker for facts and scientific explanation, the book’s got you covered. The author cites numerous studies, experiments, and research done along with the examples from the life of his patients to present the various findings with a detailed explanation. He has specifically mentioned places where there isn’t much research done and hence, no concrete conclusion can be drawn from it.This book is simple and straightforward. I went into it with a view to get to know more about the effects of exercise on the brain but learned a lot of important things about the working of the brain. The important thing I learned is that brain can be analogous to a muscle: it can change and improve, it grows with use but withers due to inactivity like it follows the principle ‘use it or lose it’. For people out there, the points stated in the book about how exercise affects your learning and how it can improve your physical and mental health will certainly be a powerful motivator to get them to adopt the habit of exercising in their daily life.One of the most important things I learned from this book is how intimately our mind and body are connected and in order to function properly, we need to create an environment where everything is in balance. Getting to know more about the working of your brain will help you realize that there’s a biological basis for certain issues and you will feel a sense of control when you know how you can influence that biology.Exercise is a readily available tool which we can utilize to enhance our life. You just need to take the first step and ignite that spark. As someone who works out 5-6 days a week and eats clean, I can vouch for all the benefits of exercise as I’ve already seen them first hand. If you’re someone who wants to start your own fitness journey and need a little push, this book will be really helpful and inspiring.Check out the detailed review:"
5,0316113506,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1142366-hans,5,"Incredible read. Everyone knows the benefits of exercise on the muscles and heart but now studies have discovered what it does to the brain, which is even more impressive. The last couple of years has had an explosion of Neuroscience books. What is even more unbelievable is that the researchers have actually decided to share what they are discovering in a way anyone can understand instead of the typical closed circle of academia.To some extent the discoveries aren't surprising, but then it is always nice to actually have hard-evidence for something many people just intuited. With this book as well as a few others I have now adopted the paradigm of the baseline human body template being that of a stone-age hunter/gatherer. In the stages of evolution of the human body and mind we spent most of our time in that time period, with our bodies being finely tuned to that lifestyle. Now anytime we deviate too far from that active lifestyle and diet we start to experience the detrimental effects. Our sedentary easy-access-to-processed-food lifestyles are in direct contradiction to what our bodies were optimized for hence all the multitude of obvious ailments plaguing the industrialized world.The latest studies have revealed1) Exercise helps produce the chemicals in the brain that grow new neurons in the brain, increasing our learning aptitude.2) Exercise regulates and balances the multitude of chemicals and hormones in our brain that directly affect our mood, specifically depression. Cognitive therapy works on depression from the pre-frontal cortex down, and anti-depressant medication works from the brain stem up, exercise attacks depression from both the top and the bottom, as well as re-wiring and re-structuring the brain, causing long-term changes.3) It helps people with ADHD improve their ability to focus. 4) It helps anyone struggling with addiction to gain the strength, motivation to over come it.4) Women get more for less with exercise, it helps balance all the fluctuations brought on from the different cycles of hormone levels from menstruation, pregnancy, post-postpartum, and menopause. 5) It helps old people prevent Alzheimer's, dementia, osteoporosis. As well as keeping their energy levels higher, improving their mood, and helping with their mental acuity.All in all, if there was one silver bullet that magically possessed all humans needed to thrive and be healthy both mentally and physically exercise would be it. Our bodies and minds work best when they are moving."
6,0316113506,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1148622-niki,5,This book was well written and extremely persuasive. It got me back into fitness again & I'm thankful. 
7,0316113506,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,5,"This book is a review of much of the research that has been published in the past decade or so, on the subject of exercise's effects on the brain. It is an absolutely first-rate book. I have read a lot about how exercise improves one's mood. But I had not realized the many other benefits to one's brain, intelligence, memory, problem solving, that are induced by exercise. The very first chapter describes how a strong school exercise program has benefited an entire school district. Exercise can actually induce physical enhancements to the brain, for example, increase the volume of the hypothalamus by up to 30%. This book is quite amazing--highly recommended!"
8,0316113506,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17445016-sambasivam-mani,5,"Must-Read book. At this modern age bad habits and laziness are killing people. To save lives and have a healthy life exercise is must. This book reveals the secret that exercise will strengthen our brain and body together. People who are addicted to bad habits get addicted to it because they need the pleasure to overcome depression, anger, stress and pain. This book tells us how to avoid bad habits and start exercising. People who thinks that exercise is an additional work or burden should read this book and understand the importance of exercise and how it can change their life. Physical activities change biological reaction in the body. People who do regular exercise stay on top on a country level - which includes technology, sports, etc. Exercise is a preventive medicine as well as an antidote. Exercise particularly affects our executive function - planning, organization, initiate or delay a response, consequence evaluation, learning from mistake, maintain the focus, working memory and it helps us to access the front part of the brain (prefrontal cortex - both right and left) and increases the learning ability. Author of book (John J. Ratey) talks about a particular kind of Squat which helps to increase the learning ability by concentrating on prefrontal cortex.Pain is related to depression and exercise is an antidepressant. Depression is defined by an absence of moving toward anything, and exercise is the way to divert those negative signals and trick the brain into coming out of hibernation.Inactivity kills muscles and brain. however exercise helps our body to grow muscles, grow brain tissues and avoids aging.Learned the importance of mind-body connection and the idiom ""Prevention is better than cure"". Author talks about different factors which plays a major role in our body.BDNF - Brain-Derived Neurotrophic FactorIGF-1 - Insulin-like Growth FactorFGF-2 - Fibroblast Growth Factor VEGF - Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor DBS - Deep Brain StimulationECT - ElectroConvulsive TherapyTMS - Transcranial Magnetic StimulationPET - Positron-Emission tomographyADHD - Attention Deficit Hyperactivity DisorderVTA - Ventral Tegmental Area.DDAT - Dyslexia, Dyspraxia & Attention TreatmentDDR - Dance Dance RevolutionLTP - Long Time PotentiationLLPDD - Late Luteal Phase Dysphoric DisorderCBT - Cognitive Behavioral TherapyPMDD - Premenstrual Dysphoric DisorderGAGA - Glutamate and Gamma-aminobutyric AcidEPDS - Edinburgh Postnatal Depression ScaleHRT - Hormone Replacement TherapyCDC - Centers for Disease ControlThis books explains why it is good to maintain health as it helps us to stay away from disease and helps us to recover fast when affected with disease. On the whole, Better Fitness = Better Results = Better Performance."
9,0316113506,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68030-jenny-reading-envy,4,"To be fair, I skimmed this book for bits that were relevant to me. I read chapter 3: Stress, very carefully. It was a revelation to discover that the body actually creates glucose as part of the stress reaction, and shuts down cells from processing it so that it remains available for immediate energy, leftover from back when stress was always physical danger.All sorts of connections to my own health - made. ""One of the ways exercise optimizes energy usage is by triggering the production of more receptors for insulin. In the body, having more receptors means better use of blood glucose and stronger cells. Best of all, the receptors stay there, which means the newfound efficiency gets built in. If you exercise regularly, and the population of insulin receptors increases if there is a drop in blood sugar or blood flow, the cell will still be able to squeeze enough glucose out of the bloodstream to keep working. Also, exercise increases IGF-1, which helps insulin manage glucose levels."" "
10,0316113506,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18944510-mario-tomic,4,"The big idea of the book is very simple: Physical activity is a necessary part of our evolution to develop ourselves both physically and mentally. John Ratey, the author, starts the book with a hypothesis that we have developed superior brains because we're creatures that need to move to find food. Adding on to that exercise keeps us sharp through several neuro-pathways that helps us learn the best ways to manage our food, predict how our environments work and remember all of this for the future use. In essence the connection between physical activity and learning is hardwired into the brain's circuitry.The book then dives into the damaging effects of the modern sedentary lifestyle and goes into dozens of studies presenting positive effects of exercise on learning, stress management, anxiety, depression, ADHD, addiction, hormonal changes, and aging related conditions such as Alzheimer's Disease. Every single one of these conditions can be massively improved through exercise.One thing about this book that might put off a lot of people is that it's quite technical and goes into A LOT of studies and case studies. That makes the book a big harder to digest, and adding to that the whole message of the book which is basically ""Exercise is good for you."" could probably be presented in a more attractive way.At the same time I really enjoyed the details, I think it does help the reader to ""buy-in"" more into exercise as a lifestyle as the benefits are enormous no matter what age, gender or lifestyle you have right now.I would definitely recommend this book if you're not sure what exercise does because you'll learn all the ways how it shapes your brain, and the benefits it has to living a happier and more fulfilled life."
11,0316113506,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2127983-alex,2,"As a gym teacher, I am all about movement. I want my kids to be active and engaged for as much of class as possible. But even though I was already on the exercise bandwagon, I had no idea how extensive the benefits of exercise really are. In Spark, John Ratey explains why the benefits of exercise to the heart, lungs, and muscles, are secondary to the benefits of exercise to the brain. The first chapter is the most engaging, where he shows how a few rogue school systems boosted test scores and lowered behavioral issues by introducing morning exercise programs. One school scored in the top 5 in the world in math and science. The book gets progressively more boring. Each chapter following deals with a specific issue: depression, anxiety, ADHD, women's health, aging, etc. And in these chapters Ratey provides tons of research that explains, in maddeningly boring detail, what exactly exercise does to alleviate issue X. The main takeaway from Spark is that humans are creatures that are meant to move, and exercising balances us out in untold ways. It literally makes your brain a higher functioning organ, which makes your self a better self. So exercise. There, I just saved you 271 pages of reading. The other, less important takeaway was that humans do terrible, awful things to rats in the name of research. Poor rats.Ultimately, Spark is an important book, but one that is a slog unless this issue is one that fascinates you."
12,0316113506,http://goodreads.com/user/show/454028-kate,4,"Oh my god. According to this book I am a walking recipe for Alzheimer's disease. This is a book by a Harvard psychiatrist about the link between mental health and exercise. As life-long depression sufferer with not one, but two parents who suffer/ed from Alzheimer's, I'm pretty much in the exponentially high risk category for dementia. But there is hope, if I get off my ass and start exercising.The author covers, not only the brain physiology of exercise in relation to aging, depression, anxiety, ADHD and addictions, he also takes on the PE establishment--you know, those dodgeball-playing, drill-sargeant, sadistic bastards we used to have as gym teachers? The ones who coached the good athletes in their classes and pretty much ignored and/or humiliated everyone else? Apparently, there's a movement afoot to change the way gym is taught (high time, I'd say) that actually encourages physical fitness. What a concept.Anyway. This is worth a read. Where's the nearest gym?"
13,0316113506,http://goodreads.com/user/show/528752-rebecca,3,"I'm torn on the number of stars I want to give this book. I love the message of the book and it has truly changed the way I think about exercise! = 4/5 stars. But, as a non-scientist, I felt bogged down by the (loooong) sections that tried to explain how certain processes work in the brain. = 2/3 stars. He ""proves"" his theories with all the scientific stuff, but I'd honestly rather just take his word for it than have him try to explain it. Even though I listened to every word, I pretty much still had to take his word for it, because I didn't understand what he was explaining. What I did like was the case studies, especially of the school in the first chapter. At this school, P.E. grades are based on effort, not skill, as determined by heart rate monitors. As a slow and uncoordinated athlete (he he) I embrace that concept!! I am already in the habit of exercising nearly every day, as is my husband. I already encourage my kids to be active: I strictly limit the amount of time they spend on screens; they're all in sports on a weekly or more basis (except for my youngest); I take them swimming, to the park, on bike rides etc. I already knew exercise is good for the body and mind but this book takes it to the next level. Basically the author says exercising literally grows brain cells. As you move your body, you move your brain connections. Exercise today puts a deposit in your brain's bank account for your golden years. I believe it and am even more motivated to stay active and to keep my kids active. I feel validated as a mom battling against screens for my kids. (Sorry, kids!) Oh, except I have to say, now I'm thinking about getting Just Dance for our Wii. I'm on the primal bandwagon and this book fits right in with that lifestyle and backs it up with science (that I don't understand!)What stuck out to me the very most is the author's recommendation for certain sports for kids with ADHD. I have two kids diagnosed with ADHD. Two of the sports he recommends are gymnastics and karate. It just so happens that my daughter (ADHD with a capital H) is in gymnastics (and she's amazing!!) and my son is in karate. They picked their sports . . . I wonder if their brains knew something I didn't? I've heard before that exercise has the same effect on the brain as ADHD pills, but without the side effects. The author of this book agrees. Our son does fine without medication, but our daughter needs it to get through the school year. This summer I decided to not give her her pills, let her more active summer days be her drug and get rid of some of the side effects. I've been surprised by how well she's done. I'm a believer. If only the school days weren't so stressful on her. I think our school does a great job with keeping the kids active, especially the last couple of years with a grant they won . . . but it's still school and she still struggles.Anyway . . .

In my opinion a must read.John Ratey is clinical professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and this is basically his research paper on how exercise shapes our brain and makes us better learners, reduces stress and anxiety, may help with addictions, attention deficits and age related decline.After a quite engaging opening story, about how exercise positively influences students at schools, the rest of the book is really dense with facts and resembles more a text book. Besides just learning about exercise, you learn a lot about our brain in general and how it works. It’s not a book you can read on the side but it’s really more about learning about the science behind HOW exercise is good and eventually extracting what’s most important for you.The book is separated into different chapters, looking at the topics like learning, stress, anxiety and depression individually. In those chapters key points are partially repeated, so that the chapters are able to stand alone and full context is provided. That way you can skip between the chapters and look into what interests you the most without missing the required knowledge to understand the context.From the reviews I see that some express criticisms on the writing style, so to make it clear: This book is not for you, if you don’t expect lots of science and facts. Also this book doesn’t discuss WEATHER exercise is good for our brain but HOW. Repetition happens to some extent for the purpose of context, as stated above, which is why it’s not a negative but a positive attribute. I love it!"
15,0316113506,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51274961-deanna,5,"Spark: The Revolutionary New Science of Exercise and the Brain by John J. Ratey takes a fascinating look at the relationship between exercise and brain function. Citing numerous scientific studies as well as various anecdotal stories, Ratey looks at the benefits of exercise relative to learning, stress, anxiety, depression, attention deficit, hormonal changes, and aging. Anyone looking for some motivation to exercise or to improve their consistency is certain to find something in the text. Most of the focus relates to aerobic exercise, but other forms of exercise are also mentioned although they generally do not have as many scientific studies relating to them. The following are some general take always from the book:1. Exercise improves both the body and the mind.2. Consistent exercise balances the chemistry of the brain.3. Exercise can actually build neural pathways reversing previous damage.4. There are far more good reasons to get off my butt and exercise than excuses not to do so.While the book can be a little tedious with all of the biochemistry, it is definitely worth taking time to read and I would recommend it for everyone. 5 stars."

Yes, (nearly) every day.I used to find it extremely boring and exhausting in the past and, to tell the truth, I still do. But now I do it with a sense of mission to rewire the brain. The thing is that I am already quite sporty and I understand the importance of getting to the gym at least 3 times a week (yes, that often). But after this book, I also understood that exercise could be a kind of replacement therapy for a great many things that happen to the body and the brain. I get up and do a couple of laps around the lake near my house. I listen to noisy birds and croaky frogs. Finally, I don't go on Facebook first thing in the morning. There.

It is a nice and refreshing read during a time where pharmacy, pill based therapy, is often over used putting life style change by the way side. The author, a medical doctor, surveys a series of topics from the improvement of kids tests from physical fitness, the decrease in symptoms of stress, anxiety, depression, sickness in aging can result from a regimented exercise routine.Overall, the book makes a very good argument to increase one's physical fitness.

This being a pop-science book it'll be most effective if you're a logically minded person or in need of some explicit reasons to overcome creeping apathy or procrastination. One of the best aspects of a book on exercise is that you can test and verify the essential ideas as they relate to your own experience; I often listened to the audiobook while jogging or at the gym. Knowing more about how something you're doing is good for you is an additional reward in itself, and for me this encapsulates the main value of reading this book.The book is of course pro-exercise throughout its illustrative anecdotes and in its description of the physiological mechanisms involved, but it does look at a wide variety of experience, from physical pain to depression & mental disorders to everyday moods. Ratey isn't as good as a journalist or fiction writer, but he's clearly a doctor who's explained these ideas to patients and skeptics before, and he provides a reasonable and persuasive case for the substantially positive effects of exercising and elevating heart rate on a regular basis (i.e. in a manner consistent with natural human evolution)."

There is so much good that exercise can do for a person, both physically (of course) and mentally; both immediately and over time. I didn't understand all the neurology mentioned in this book, but the author was good at clearly summarizing the scientific findings. This book has been an excellent motivator for me (I'm the girl who took a full load of AP classes and music electives in high school so I could get out of that extra semester of PE!); I don't need to be the fastest runner or the most flexible or the strongest to enjoy the many benefits of exercise!"
24,0316113506,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2588199-jack,2,"Exercise is good for the brain. Okay, that's credible, could you tell me more? The authors begin with a very promising anecdote about a school in Naperville. I find it compelling. Then they proceed to ramble through a supposed survey of the modern neuroscientific literature. This might be genius. It might be crap. And I can't tell after having read the book, and that's definitely for crap.I am enormously sympathetic to the challenges of writing a scientific book for the lay public. It's hard. I get it. But compare this to NurtureShock. Neither uses footnotes. Because, I am told, footnotes are scary. But NurtureShock includes a big section at the back where they document the basis for their assertions. They use a trick well known to many historians, of providing detailed references for their assertions in a Notes section by keying to page and then distinctive phrase, rather than to a footnote. This lets one go and read for one self if one finds something interesting or dubious.The author of Spark take a much more condescending approach. Just trust me, the lead author asserts, he is, after all, on the faculty at Harvard. (Are clinical professors really ""on the faculty""?) And so the descriptions of the evidence behind his repeated and bold claims are skimpy, and there is nowhere else to go. And, in a book purporting to be about bringing the benefits of science to people, this seems to me utterly unacceptable. * * *Now, it turns out that I'm being hard on Dr. Ratey. If you google him, you can find his webpage. If you go to Publication, you find his book, and when you click on the link to ""learn more"", you are delivered to Amazon to buy it. (Seriously, not even an alternative to an independent bookstore, John?) But if you go to Resources, you can find a bibliography for each Chapter -- not keyed to individual assertions in the Chapters, mind you -- with a set of references. I couldn't find any reference to this web page in the book when I was initially looking for it. But if you really, really, really insist on seeing the evidence he cites, you can sort of kind of find it. I leave it to you, dear reader, to decide whether this supports or disproves my conjecture about the intellectual tone of the book."
25,0316113506,http://goodreads.com/user/show/961912-cj,2,"I like to move. I don't dread exercise, I enjoy it. My problem is that I tend to relegate exercise into the category of ""fun"" instead of ""necessity"". Because of this, I am always on the look out for ways to remind myself that exercise is essential. In that regard Spark is extremely handy. I don't like exercising because it is ""healthy""; I find that reasoning way too wishy-washy for my brain to wrap around. I like looking good. But I suppose I'm just not shallow enough to devote my time to my own ego. But I like my brain...most of the time. Dr. Ratey emphasizes that exercising is not for your body but for your mind. For me, science junkie that I am, his effort to demonstrate the necessity of exercise for my brain was extremely motivational and made sense. But I don't like the way he did it. The problem is: he doesn't back up his claims with any references to the research he cites. One of my favorite science-as-self-help books is Daniel Goleman's Emotional Intelligence, and I enjoy Malcolm Gladwell's watered-down research in Blink. I'm not sure how good their references are, but both authors cite the research they use to prove their points. From Dr. Ratey there is zip! In one chapter he refers to a study done by the U.S Department of Energy that tracked two groups of nuclear shipyard workers. One group was exposed to radiation, the other group wasn't. Supposedly, the group exposed to the radiation was in better health. Then he claims the study was never published because it failed to show the expected malignant results of radiation. Maybe that is true. Maybe it's not. But there isn't much the reader can do but accept what he says. When authors use research to support their claims, but then are vague about their sources, it makes me very uncomfortable, especially when I can compare it to other books where the authors make a much better effort to give their ideas credibility, even in the field of pop-science. I don't regret reading it. It offers a very interesting perspective on why I should make exercise a priority, and it has motivated me to change bits of my life style to make that happen. I could not recommend buying it, which is a shame since his ideas seem very interesting and worth exploring. But that's the problem: he offers the reader no option for exploration of the ideas he presents."

I was delighted by the book in the first few chapters and excited to read the rest. but from then on i was very disappointed.The author changed from laymens terms and delightful stories to prove his points to writing as if the book were an academic paper to be published in a neurological journal, and it got very tedious very fast. Being well schooled in neurology I forced myself to continue reading to the end but I am certain most readers would not understand half of what is said in the last half of the book.I had high hopes for this book as the effects of exercise on the brain are an interisting topic, but as a whole this book is poorly executed and for most people reading more than just the first few chapters would be a complete waste of time!"

Let me give you a hint, their minds are effected nearly as much as their bodies based on this activity.Stress, anxiety, depression, ADD, hormones. What do they have in common? Exercise is one of the most effective tools to mitigate their effects. It might be one of the most powerful tools we have and we don't even realize it. It is simply amazing the scientific studies showing the effects of excercise on the brain. Highly recommend for people who are into fitness or looking for motivation to get fit.

He then details how exercise has benefitted particular subgroups, such as those with ADHD or depression, pregnant women, and the elderly. Despite discussing some unfamiliar neurochemical names, the narrative remains very accessible to the layperson.

However, I was usually thinking of mental exertion. For example, I told the the kids that's why they had to memorize poetry, or sing math facts. This book takes an angle that I had not considered: that the brain needs physical activity (specifically aerobic exercise) to keep it healthy. I knew that physical exercise benefited your heart and lungs and muscles etc, but this was a fascinating look at how physical activity benefits the brain; triggering new growth and sending all kinds of happy hormones that can help not only with aging, but with various mental health diagnoses like anxiety, depression, and ADHD. My only hang-up is that sometimes it was a bit technical and hard to keep all the different neurotransmitters and hormones straight. But I decided that I wouldn't worry about gaining a complete neurological understanding. Even if I don't know *exactly* what fibroblast growth factor is, or how it is produced or used, I can definitely see the value in maintaining a challenging exercise routine for my brain as well as the rest of me!"

Especially for the mind. Doing sports makes sure our brain makes new connections. Neurogenesis, the regrowth of your brain cells, is a fascinating topic. We thought our brain was fixed, guess it is not.Running, lifting weights or doing acrobatics, they all contribute to a better brain. Not only better blood flow, but also better brain functioning. It is best to sport just before you learn. As new connections will be formed. Even a 20 minutes of walking improves it tremendously!If you don't move anymore, you die. Sports make brain cells, school fills them.Sport also makes sure your neurotransmitters are fine-tuned. You're more relaxed after doing a great workout.In short: a very interesting read.

Not only does exercise make you think faster, it also improves your mood, makes you live longer, and can reverse soem of the effects of aging. Ratey's book makes aerobic exercise sound like a snake-oil panacea, except that he backs it up with evidence as to what it's doing at a chemical level.Even though I've read more than one book on neurology, some of the biochemistry in this went over my head. I would have had to read it several times to remember what chemical does what. If you have more of a scientific background, the chemical/neurology might be easier to understand. However, he does describe what each thing means for the layman. Basically, the premise of this book is that aerobic exercise makes you better in just about every way, shape, and form. He briefly touches on balance and weight-bearing exercise, but mostly, he talks about aerobic exercise, and it gets to the point where you can see he's pretty particular about running.From the standpoint of a reader who likes science, this was a pretty good book. A little hard to understand at parts, but not more than the book BUZZ or some other pop-science books I've read. It describes exactly what chemicals are released in your blood when you exercise, and what those chemicals do to other chemicals in your brain, and what the underlying result is. From the standpoint of a woman who would like to be healthier, I found it a little daunting. First of all, because Ratey holds running up as the ideal exercise. I'm a big fan of exercise. I love aerobics, dance, swimming, gardening, walking, weight lifting, rock climbing, martial arts, and pilates and do them whenever the opportunity presents itself without any problem. Running causesme excruciating pain, itching, and depression. So it's hard to read a treatise on exercise that hints strongly that running is really the best type of exercise, that all others are inferior. It's like a vegan reading a treatise that insists that dairy products are really the only decent source of calcium. At one point Ratey gives a hagiographic description of a man who's an expert marathoner. He suggests that despite the runner's 3-4 hours a day of running training, he still has enough time for his job and family. The catch? He only sleeps 5 hours a night. Ugh.I suppose you can't have a book that talks about exercise that doesn't at some point suggest the ideal amount of exercise. The good news, a little exercise will help you more than you think. More exercise will help you a lot. The bad news, his ""ideal"" amount of exercise is 45 minutes to an hour of ""high"" exertion (where jogging is ""moderate"" and walking is ""mild"") every day, along with two or three days of interval training. This disincludes the weight-bearing or stretching or balance exercise that one might presumably also want. I'm not sure what sort of lifestyle has room for the ""ideal"" amount of exercise. Hunter-gatherer maybe. Single guy without a girlfriend. I've read a lot of characters in novels who run an hour every morning, but they're also usually heiresses with violet eyes, who do their taxes early and actually clean behind the refrigerator. Regular schmoes will have to make do with gardening or walking the dog or an occasional game of tennis.Rainey also discusses how exercise can help children do well at school, and this is something that parents might want to read about. I won't get into specifics, but the results are startling, if true, and make the elimination of PE classes from cash-strapped schools even more of an atrocity.I recommend this book for pop-science buffs and people who like to obsess about their health."
39,0316113506,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2021933-cara,5,"Totally fascinating so far. Exercise helps you learn by making your brain grow.

He gives the full story, yet the style is engaging and never obfuscated. This is the best thing I've read in months.Notes:p. 46 -- lab rats taken home to play with kids smarter.

Neurogenesis: ""Neurons are born as blank-slate stem cells, and they go through a development process in which they need to find something to do in order to survive. Most of them don't. It takes about twenty-eight days for a fledgling cel to plug into a network, and, as with existing neurons, Hebb's concept of activity-dependent learning would apply: if we don't use the newborn neurons, we lose them... Ironically, with running, The same percentage of cells die as in the control group--it's just that you have a bigger starting pool. But in order for a cell to survive and integrate, it has to fire its axon. Exercise spawns neurons, and the stimulation of environmental enrichment helps those cells survive.""p. 65 ""Two neurotransmitters put the brain on alert: norepinephrine arouses attention, then dopamine sharpens and focuses it."" Imbalance => ADD people can focus only under stress--need norepinephrine to get dopamine. Thus the project firefighters who are really arsonists.p. 74 Unrelenting stress--stress hormones just keep flowing. Amygdala keeps firing, cortisol overflow. Too much physically damages the hippocampus--free radicals kill cells there and retract dendrites. Neurogenesis is interrupted. Weight gain around belly, insulin resistance, etc. Vicious cycle--the more the amygdala fires, the stronger it gets and the weaker the hippocampus &c (braking, context, rational thought) become. Exercise kick-starts the recovery process and restores balance among neurotransmitters.p. 92 exercise helps with anxiety disorder, also helps average people feel less anxious.p. 99 exercise as effective as antianxiety drugs in study of people with panic disorderp. 103 overcoming fear: ""While we can't erase the original fear memory, can't remove old memory, we can essentially drown it out by creating a new memory and reinforcing it. By building up parallel circuitry to the fear memory, the brain creates a neutral alternative to the expected anxiety, learning that everything is OK. by wiring in the correct interpretation, the trigger is disconnected from the typical response, weakening the associating, between, say, seeing a spider and experiencing terror and a racing heart. Scientists call it reattribution.""p. 123 exercise better than Zoloft at fighting depressionOther amazing results: reverse the mental effects of aging, lessen PMS, help with ADD and addiction.

40,0316113506,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7551285-marcelo-bahia,5,"This book really deserves a 5-star rating. Not because it's one of those ""almost perfect"" books, but because of the meaningful impact it will probably have in the life of the reader.You'll be eager and excited to seriously insert exercise in your daily routine after reading this. The positive consequences mentioned in the book are all really visible to anyone after a few weeks or months of training.When I first saw the book, I thought ""how could anyone write a WHOLE book on the relationship between exercise and the brain?"". In Brain Rules: 12 Principles for Surviving and Thriving at Work, Home, and School by John Medina, the subject deserved only a chapter, and it seemed more than enough!To my surprise, it's really a pleasure to read the whole book. Surely, sometimes the book can be repetitive - the separate chapters dedicated to anxiety, attention, aging, etc, could easily been made as subsections of a same chapter, if the format was a paper/article instead of a book. Still, although the main logic is the same across all chapters, each one adds at least one important aspect or nuance to the subject.Some people might also think that the biological explanations are more detailed than they should, but you can easily skip them if you want to. Despite possibly making the reading less pleasurable for some of the people, I still think they are needed, as they make the book much more suitable to doctors who don't work in the neurology field.

Don’t get me wrong, I love reading about rat experiments, control groups and isolated variables, i really do. The timeline, range and depth of the science described is impressive. And being able to toss words like amygdala and hippocampus and cerebellum into casual conversation at the appropriate time has a certain value.But. I struggled. This is certainly not Gladwell style readability. What kept me going was the enticing title of the last chapter “The Regimen”. It was definitely going to give me a new ""how to” guide brimming with nuggets of insight. Sadly not. Spoiler alert!

I have been touting this book since I read it - as a must for everyone. I myself, will ""get healthy"" and then lose interest - seeing exercise as unrelated to other goals of career and family. This book has convinced me that I was wrong, and that I'd be selfish and self-limiting with respect to my family and career if I DON'T exercise. This is a real mind-changing experience.

This book lays out the scientific information on why exercise is good for our brains and bodies. It also gives you a sense of how to start and accomplish a successful exercise program. I agree that the book can be somewhat repetitive, however, I find that the best way to get my patients to do what is good for them is consistent drilling into their brains."

As others have noticed, aerobic exercise-and specifically running- is his heavy recommendation. He does say that any aerobic exercise that elevates the heart rate for a sustained period will do. Now, I hate aerobic exercise. I hate running. I do lift weights, and I was hoping that the benefits would be the same, but there are far fewer studies and the results are not so clear. I "

It sat on the back burner for a year but now I wish I would have read it sooner. Spark focuses on the research that points to the beneficial impact aerobic exercise has on academics, brain development, anxiety, depression, ADD, hormone shifts in women, and cognitive aging. While we all know that exercise is a great stress reliever and great for our physical health, research indicates it does a lot more than that. It directly impacts the architecture of our brain. So while you do any aerobic exercise, you’re getting more than that exercise high, you actually grow brain cells, solidify brain cell connections, and restructure your brain! I mean this book is full of neuroscience terminology, which can get a little challenging to keep track of but I found it’s thesis so fascinating! If you don’t like books with a lot of science-y terminology, just know that aerobic exercise = brain cell growth. Here are some of the conclusions I came to while reading:- Exercise should be an essential part of treatments for people with mental health conditions, along with the necessary medication and therapy. - Education, again, is done all wrong in the United States. Physical education, the type described here where the focus is fitness and not team sports, can do a lot to prep students’ brains for learning. - People deserve access to free, safe, and quality exercise spaces. But not everyone gets that. I think a lot about my students who live in places with very limited green spaces, safe streets, or attend charter schools that lack robust physical education programs or sports programs. - We know that trauma and poverty, lack of privilege and access, living in food deserts, or no access to quality health care can all impact physical health. These conditions often exist in frontline communities like communities of color or immigrant communities. Often communities with a high number of people that are impacted by the aforementioned conditions struggle with preventable diseases. - I need to push for PE for all 4 years of high school, every year of middle school, and extended recess and PE classes for elementary schools. With quality PE programs, schools can help frontline communities counter the detrimental health impacts of food deserts, lack of quality health care, and poverty. Schools can use exercise to support student learning, and in particular neurodiverse students. A lot of schools are moving toward trauma-informed practices, but lack the adequate resources to fully support students with mental health needs. Schools can utilize exercise as part of their trauma-informed practices to help support the mental health of students.Not all these conclusions came directly from the book. But they arrive as part of how this book pertains to my life as a high school teacher and parent."

For mental health, for a better mood, to fight those hormonal blues, to curb anxiety, to combat stress, to address depression, to be learner for life and in the bargain, to lose some weight and become physically fit. And not just run, do anything that gets your heart rate up for at least half an hour everyday (skip, jump, swim, dance, aerobics, any sport). Because what exercise can do for your brain and mind is far more valuable than what it can do for your body!This book has been transformational in how I think and feel about exercise - it motivates me in a different, more convincing, way about why I need to get going and push myself to do some strenuous physical activity, when all I want to do at the end of a long work day is collapse into bed, hog and binge watch a useless show. The kind of lives we live now takes such a toll on our mood and general feeling of contentment, manifesting itself into so many different issues of fatigue, stress, disease, depression, anxiety, and so on. All we want is to feel better... but most of us seem to be looking for a solution in something that requires less work - like a diet, or pills, or just procrastinating endlessly.I know exercise is important to be healthy, but I never realised it could be mentally therapeutic to this level. Ofcourse, I'd heard and read about the magic of endorphins - the happy hormones that come from sweating it out. But I'd never imagined that endorphins were just one of the side effects of exercise, and that it could have a much more transformational physiological impact on our brains. It literally re-circuits the brain.""Unlike antidepressants, exercise doesn't selectively influence anything - it adjusts the chemistry of the entire brain to restore normal signalling."" The book does get very technical in some places - but that's necessary to help us understand how exactly the chemistry and physiology in the brain works and how exercise impacts it. I'd recommend everyone to give this a read... especially if you're like me, naturally lazy, thyroidically sluggish and generally unmotivated to move! :) "
57,0316113506,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9225232-elaine,4,"The whole idea of exercise affecting the brain, not just the body, is fascinating! (5 stars) But the reading of how it all works and how they discovered this, is not so fascinating.(2 stars) There's a lot of details about how neurotransmitters, neurotrophins, various parts of the brains, hormones, etc. work, and many accounts of experiments (on rats and on people), and also anecdotes about dramatic effects of exercise on specific people facing various problems. I found the anecdotes the most interesting, but I guess scientifically, it wouldn't be convincing without the experiments and the biological explanations, but those were a slog to get through. Anyway, the fascinating part is how exercise can be used to treat or prevent problems that are generally under the umbrella of ""mental health""-stress, depression, anxiety, addiction, dementia (including from Alzheimer's and Parkinson's), ADHD...plus PMS and menopause. It's pretty convincing and it's definitely got me feeling like I need to do more exercise. I kept waiting for the book to tell me how much do I have to do. It somewhat answers that at the end of the book, but it's not really like an exact science. Bottom line, do SOMETHING, which is better than nothing, and more is better. Rough guidelines-exercise 6 times a week, mixing low, moderate, and high intensity, roughly 45-60 minutes each time, and include strength training twice a week...which is probably not much different than exercise advice for general physical health to prevent a host of other problems like osteoporosis or heart disease. It also gives some tips: Start slow, building up to this, go with a friend, etc. If this had been shorter, with fewer nitty-gritty details, I would have enjoyed this more, but it's still worth reading."

Even good events can trigger the amygdala. This is why love can trigger fear. Storing glucose is a critical part of the brain function. If we are under too much stress, it will block out and erase our memories. This is why it is hard to focus when we are under attack. The best thing to do is block out the emotions and keep the logical brain sharp. The only way to reverse this is to workout and to believe that you are happy and grateful - no matter what. The best way to build muscles are to break them down and let them rest. Rats that were given less food than normal live longer. Exercise builds trust in yourself. Don't listen to doctors when they tell you to rest and want to prescribe drugs - run/workout instead. The more you stress, the more you must move to keep the cells happy. Exercise can help prevent breast cancer. People who have anxiety issues has learning difficulties and will always have a problem with attaining informations. When you know what's on the other side, it's easier to break through difficulties.Burn those depression! Adhd people will forget many things and procrastinate.

This is absolutely fascinating from start to finish. (Okay, so it may get a tad bit dry when the reader begins to go a little too deep in the research, but that only happened once or twice and didn't last long.) The premise of the whole book is how many of our (Americans') issues can be made better (or completely resolved) with a regular consistent dose of exercise added to our daily lives. The studies and research quoted are mind-boggling in parts (wait til you read/hear about the nun who donated her brain to science!). While I've always been told that I need to add more exercise (and movement, in general) to my daily life, this book has inspired me to do it - consistently - going forward. The best part of it, while it certainly describes how you can add actual exercise routines into your schedule, it's also wonderful at introducing the idea that social activities can be exercise, too, which is always more fun than getting your daily dose alone.
