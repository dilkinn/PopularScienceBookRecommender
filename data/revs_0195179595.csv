0,0195179595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1480967-david,2,"I finished reading Susan Blackmore's Conversations on Consciousness today (aah, the benefit of being under the weather over shabbat). This book is definitely worth reading, because over the course of doing so, I became convinced that none of these thinkers are any closer to understand the central riddle of consciousness than the blind men grasping the elephant. There is not widespread agreement on problem definitions, basic methodologies, or even what the known elements are. I wouldn't say that we've progressed much past the era of Plato's Cave in our thinking. I noticed something as I was reading this multiplicity of views on fundamental topics: Western religious thought was completely absent. The predominant viewpoint was functionally athiestic, and those who admitted any spiritual or religious thinking were either Buddhist or Hindu in their background or thinking. Kabbalah was mentioned in a way which equated it with Eastern mysticism (which shows a profound misunderstanding of both, honestly), and that was the closest to any Abrahamic tradition cited. It is a shame that no inspiration is drawn from the rationalist notions of the Talmud - there, the point-of-view is assumed, and the idea that one may witness event X in a reportable manner but witness event Y in a non-reportable manner is also a given. The Talmud is pre-Gödelian, in that it assumes that it is inconsistent (c.f. eilu v'eilu) *and* incomplete (c.f. teiku) - the only complete understanding of all of the possible truths in existence is that possessed by God Himself, and we are sparks of His creation who dwell in reflected glory. The idea of a soul is pretty much derided by these thinkers, and that's unfortunate. I'm reminded of J. Michael Straczynski who said ""faith and reason are shoes on your feet; you get much further with both than with just one.""Back to the book.Blackmore is a good interviewer, and she asks interesting questions. Two she asks of all of her thinkers are ""do you think you have free will?"" and ""do you believe in the philosopher's zombie?"" (NOTE: the philosopher's zombie is a being who is externally indistinguishable from a normal person, but is not conscious inside. This should not be confused with the zombies of either Jonathan Coulton or The Franchise fame)Now, to my untutored eye, these questions are both ridiculous. Of course I have free will (or at least ""free won't"" in the Hofstaderian sense - I can't will myself to fly around the room, but I can will myself not to get off the couch), and I would firmly place the burden of proof on anyone who would suggest otherwise - they should have to construct a testable hypothesis rather than a mere thought experiment, and once this has been done I'll entertain it. Until then, I'll lump the ""no free will"" folks fit into the same category as the flat earthers and people trying to patent perpetual motion machines (sidenote: the USPTO doesn't normally require working copies of patented machines, unless the stated claim violates the second law of thermodynamics...). But what about the Zombie? Um, what about him? I already can't know anyone else's internal state - this would speculate that there are beings with internal states which are qualitatively different from me who interact with me in ways where I can only experience their external actions? OH NOES! That just described everyday existence. So to sum up, this book is a great review of where we stand in this field, and I would say that we're somewhere in the proto-phlogiston chemistry model of consciousness. I suspect that in 100 years, our descendants be deeply embarrassed by these ideas."
1,0195179595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/185000-jon-stout,4,"This collection of interviews served as a great opportunity to compare various points of view and professional approaches to the study of consciousness. Those interviewed fell into familiar categories: neuroscientists, philosophers, cognitive scientists, those interested in Buddhist meditation, and so forth. Some I was familiar with, such as Ramachandran, the Churchlands, Dennett and Searle. Others had interesting ideas, that I might want to pursue, such as Chalmers and Wegner. Still others I could dismiss, such as those who had some variation of Descartes’ pineal gland, a gimmick that would be the point of connection between mind and body.Susan Blackmore asked a set of fairly uniform questions which ranged from the fundamental, such as the nature of consciousness, the existence of free will and the relationship between mind and body, to the more personal, such as if the study of consciousness had changed the researcher’s life and whether the researcher believed that consciousness could survive after death. Although I had great respect for the scientific investigators, I found I was most sympathetic to the philosopher’s approach, that of clarifying the concepts involved, or in squaring away our ways of thinking regarding disparate phenomena. For example, even though I disagree with Dennett vehemently on many topics, I could appreciate his arguments against the Cartesian Theater, the idea that consciousness is a little theater inside of our heads in which we duplicate the world. The Cartesian Theater simply duplicates the problem of consciousness on a smaller scale, and thus begs the question. Some of the hardest headed scientific researchers seemed to fall into this error. I found Ramachandran particularly charming, because he was precise in his scientific observations and yet imaginative in his philosophical conclusions, and because he managed to integrate his scientific researches with a Hindu worldview. Even though I would have liked to reread the interviews I liked best, I regretfully had to return the book, which I had obtained on an interlibrary loan."
2,0195179595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6423134-bernie-gourley,4,"Blackmore gathers together interviews from a veritable who’s who of consciousness experts from neuroscience, philosophy, physiology, psychology, and physics. While the interviews are in part tailored to tap into the special insights of the given expert, a consistent series of questions is asked of each of the interviewees. Each expert is asked what they think is challenging about consciousness, what they think about the feasibility of philosopher’s zombies (a popular thought experiment about an individual who seems to behave like an ordinary human but who has no conscious experience), what they think about the existence of free will, what happens to consciousness after death, and what got them interested in the subject. This makes it easy for the reader to see not just differences in thinking across disciplines, but also different schools of thought within disciplines. There’s enough variety to make for intriguing reading. There is also a mix between individuals who have experience with meditation (e.g. the interviewer) and those who don't, and so it's interesting to compare views of those with such insight to those who study consciousness entirely abstractly.I won’t list all the authors, but they include: David Chalmers (who famously coined the term the “hard problem” of consciousness, which is one of the most widely discussed ideas in the book), Francis Crick (of DNA fame who later shifted focus), Daniel Dennett (a well-known philosopher), V.S. Ramachandran (a neuroscientist famous for work on phantom limbs and behavioral neurology), and Roger Penrose (a physicist who believes that quantum mechanics may prove crucial to figuring out consciousness.) It’s a straightforward book. There’s an Introduction by Blackmore and then the 20 or 21 interviews (one “chapter” is a married couple – Pat and Paul Churchland -- whose insights are presented together.) The only back matter is a glossary, which is quite in-depth and which helps to clarify the many confusing concepts from various disciplines. There are a few cartoon drawings that lighten the tone, but serve no essential purpose.I enjoyed this book and found it thought-provoking. It’s quite old at this point – having come out in 2005 – but since consciousness is so intractable, it’s not like any of the questions have been cleared up. (If it were a book on AI, I’d probably say it was worthless at this point, but not this book.) I’d recommend it for anyone looking to understand the lay of the land with regards thinking about consciousness. "

I'm so excited to learn more about what scientists know about consciousness!*Tl;dr/Reality of this book*: Microtubules and quantum coherence? Neurons and synapses? Multiple drafts and heterophenomenology? Oh, okay. Got it. No one really has any idea what consciousness is or how to study it."
4,0195179595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1345046-todd-martin,2,"""Conversations on Consciousness"" consists of a number of transcribed conversations which Susan Blackmore has had with scientists and philosophers on the question of consciousness. Topics discussed include: what consciousness is, where it resides, how it arises, whether it is separate from the brain, and the 'hard problem' of the existance of subjective experience in an objective world. The answers are interesting, although the bottom line is that the science of consciousness is in its very early stages, and that there are more questions than answers (and the answers that exist are loudly debated). My main criticism of the book is that the questions are repetitious and that the answers are often incoherrent. Though not central to the theme, the book confirms my suspicion that ‘philosophy’ is largely a nonsensical field of study. In ancient Greece the best pathway to knowledge may have involved sitting around and thinking about stuff, but that is simply not the case today. We have a time tested and reliable means of arriving at truth … it’s called the scientific method. Philosophers, at their best, might be able to phrase a question in a new or interesting way, but they are otherwise irrelevant. Francis Crick (co-founder of the structure of DNA) says it well: “A lot of problems which were once regarded as philosophical, such as what is an atom, are now regarded as part of physics. Some people have argued that the main purpose of the philosopher is to deal with the unsolved problems, but the problems eventually get solved, and they get solved in a scientific way. If you ask how many cases in the past has a philosopher been successful at solving a problem, as far as we can say there are no such cases.”I wouldn’t pay much attention to what the philosophers are saying in this book. They should step aside and let the scientists do their job."
5,0195179595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18329813-corrie-campbell,3,"Susan Blackmore interviews twenty incredibly bright and accomplished people, ranging from major philosophers to renowned scientists, all of whom have devoted much of their lives to understanding the concept of consciousness. This is the strength of Conversations on Consciousness. It's weakness is it's redundancy - the cliffnotes could have been done with two interviews and 10 pages.The interviewees fall quickly and predictably into one of two camps. One, that consciousness is a product of the human brain and that neuroscience (and the scientists) will inevitably solve all the mysteries. Or two, that consciousness lies somewhere outside the human brain and we attune to it in some capacity (philosophers).Why I spent so much time and never gave up on this book after years (yes years) is a bigger mystery to me than the subject of consciousness. Why would I say that, well because your belief systems segregate you to one of the two camps before you crack the spine of the book and these interviews merely cement those beliefs. The smugness of some of those interviewed is also a big turnoff. You don't need me or my review, because the title gives away everything the book is about."
6,0195179595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/153169-mommalibrarian,4,"Do you have free will? Is this a psychological, philosophical, or biological question? This book contains interviews of psychologists, philosophers and scientists on consciousness and free will. Some of the interviews are totally baffling (worse than listening to politicians) but most can be followed. The author has pretty good grip on the science and pushes to get the same set of topics covered in each interview. Her past dabblings in parapsychology and interests in meditation and memes only occassionally slip in. It can't be avoided of course but some of the breakthroughs that the interviewees said would never happen or were impossible have happened since the book was published in 2006. I wish there were an electronic form of the book which was kept up-to-date but the author had some problems with people changing their answers when they proofed the transcript so I guess solid books are good for capturing a snapshot of thought. I think every one of these people had published one or more books on consciousness in the past. I am glad I read this one which covers the field rather than any single book on a single point of view."
7,0195179595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/783966-malcolm,4,"Wonderful read. Scientist Susan Blackmore addresses important questions about the nature of consciousness to eminent scientists in the field of neuroscience. Can Zombies really exist, what happens when we die, what is the nature of consciousness - what is it, is it an effect of the brain or something from outside us. I love the little cartoons illustrating important points and the caricatures of the scientists. I was relieved to see that most of the scientist were extremely dubious about the possibility of consciousness continuing after the death of the brain. Good read - not to technical but involved enough that I learned some things. "
8,0195179595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68510029-anthony-cleveland,3,"An interesting collection of diverse ideas regarding one of the great mysteries of neuroscience ... the nature of consciousness. It can be a challenging read at times and it is driven (i.e. biased) by the questions Dr. Blackmore asks each participant. To be honest, at times the ramblings reminded me of the verse ... ""the wisdom of man is but foolishness to God"". However, I would still highly recommend it to anyone interested in this important existential topic. "
9,0195179595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6034475-arkan,4,"Nice, excellent interviews with many psychology experts with many viewpoints. Worth a read if you're interested in psychology/consciousness, or if you're just entering the field."
10,0195179595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23888196-rama,4,"The quest for consciousness Author Susan Blackmore interviews about 20 scientists working in the physics and biology of consciousness, and focuses mainly on the neurobiological aspects of mind, subjective experience, free will and consciousness.Consciousness is a set of physical processes that give rise to conscious experience. But in order to understand the relationship between consciousness and the physical world, we need to know the nature of physical reality. This leads us to quantum physics and the explanatory gap between quantum and classical realities. We are conscious of only classical reality which is governed by the classical laws of physics, but we cannot comprehend quantum reality that is governed by the laws of quantum physics. This suggests that there is a hidden reality of nature that our mind does not sense but only revealed to us through the quantum physical measurements. Therefore our consciousness must include both classical and quantum realities. Many neuroscientists believe that consciousness is as fundamental as spacetime and matter (energy). Quantum physical measurements also imply that the physical reality does not objectively exist, but they exist after an intervention by a conscious observer.There is another thorny question still remains as to why any physical process, quantum or classical, should give rise to subjective experience. This book discusses in depth about subjective experience, free will and the nature of consciousness with the leaders of consciousness research. The book illustrates that these are really hard problems to solve, and the opinions of the experts are varied and diverse. Many neuroscientists assume that these mental powers somehow emerge from the electrical signaling of neurons, the circuitry of the brain. Cartesian theater (CT) is a term Dan Dennett uses to describe a common idea that somewhere in the brain or mind, everything comes together and consciousness happens. Neurobiologist Susan Greenfield proposes that consciousness is associated with brain and brain generates consciousness. Dave Chalmers says, that consciousness ceases when one is dead, therefore consciousness is strongly associated with brain. Roger Penrose and Stuart Hameroff propose ""orchestrated objective reduction"" ('Orch OR') theory, according to which consciousness derives from quantum vibrations in microtubules (protein polymers inside brain neurons) which both govern neuronal and synaptic function. They connect brain processes to self-organizing processes on quantum scale to produce quantum structure of reality. Stephen LaBerge takes a Vedantic view of a universal consciousness akin to the quantum physical reality. Kevin O'Regan believes that consciousness can survive death, but in years to come we would be able to download our personality onto a computer and re-live in virtual worlds. Philosophers like David Rosenthal and Michael Graziano suggest that consciousness is illusory. They observe that we have certain beliefs about mental states, and they have distinctive functional properties which causes some forms of attention. Philosopher John Searle believes that consciousness is essentially a biological property that emerges in some systems but not in others for reasons as yet unknown. V. Ramachandran offers a neurobiological explanation as to why animals do not have the same level of consciousness as humans.Free will is another topic widely discussed in this book and it is the most disputed philosophical issue of all time. It is an idea that we can act or make choices unconstrained by external circumstances or an agency such as fate or divine will. It is often compared with determinism, which means that all events in the world are determined by prior events. The experts discussed in this book differ in their opinion. Pat and Paul Churchland, Francis Crick, and Chris Koch suggest that free will is an illusion, but Dan Dennett, Stuart Hameroff, Thomas Metzinger, and Kevin O'Regan believes that we have free will.To summarize, it is evident from the discussion presented in this book that there is a lack of complete theory by neuroscientists regarding how neural activity translates into conscious experiences. Deepak Chopra argues that it is still a speculation no matter if you want to call consciousness a fundamental property of the universe consisting of matter (or energy) operating in spacetime; or consciousness is caused by brain activity and creates the properties and objects of the material world. Some critics argue that the hypothesis that the brain creates consciousness has more evidence than the hypothesis that consciousness is a fundamental property of the universe. Such arguments falls short, since quantum reality is not considered a part of overall reality in this argument."
11,0195179595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59463805-thomas-lindmark,4,"I really liked this book. At first glance it seemed rather daunting, since it is a collection of interviews on consciousness with scientists and philosophers who have spend a lifetime dealing with the problem of consciousness. But the interviewer has a background in the same field and managed to cut thru some of more esoteric stuff. ""But that do you really mean!"".The questions all follow the same general theme. What is consciousness, what it the problem with it, what got you interested, how have you studied it, do you believe in zombies, do you believe in free will, how has this affected your life? And I think this is great, because zombies are awesome, but also because it humanizes these folks who have studied a problem for so long. We could have gotten ""the word of the great Scientist"" but instead we get the thoughts of ordinary smart people who have just found their calling. It's interesting to read how these folks studied physics, psychology, math, electrical engineering started asking questions on a problem and then spent ~30 years trying their hardest to answer these questions. It does get a more than a little esoteric in parts, but it is a great summary of the field of study and as every one of the interviewees explain their part of the story I found myself thinking really hard on things I had not considered a problem. Just the general idea that everything we experience, see, think is totally internal and subjective and separate from the real physical world. I will probably re-read this come summer when I have had time to settle the ideas a bit."
12,0195179595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1915261-scott-lupo,4,"This is a great read if you are interested in being introduced to the philosphy and science of consciousness. Susan Blackmore converses with 20 of the most well-known scientists and philosophers of our time. She generally asks the same questions to each of them but also uses their answers to go off script and get a deeper understanding of certain subject matter. It really gets to the heart of what makes us human (why did nature give us this ability?). Topics include the hard problem, free will, qualia, phenomenology, neural correlates of consciousness, memes, dualism, monism, fuctionalism, philosophers zombie, Cartesian theater, Global Workspace Theory, and a host of other concepts, theories, and studies. However, it does not get too complicated and there is a nice glossary in the back of the book that defines many of the concepts in the book. If you have ever wondered what consciousness is, how to define it, do other animals have it, is it even real, will it ever be possible to actually experience somebody else's consciousness, or will real artificial intelligence be possible then this is a good book for you to get started without worrying about too much technical jargon or feeling like you are reading a text book. "
13,0195179595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2682643-rick,4,"This brought me back to my college studies: psychology and cognitive science. It's a great read if you're interested in either of those topics, but more specifically I'd say this is a 'philosophy of mind' book. It brings up many of the philosophical arguments over the study of the mind and what it means to have consciousness.That might be intimidating, but this book isn't dense. The couple dozen interviews with philosophers, neuroscientists, neurophenomenologists(!?), etc are lively and bring up a lot of interesting points. I was surprised that even though Blackmore's interview questions remain the same across interviews, the responses are all quite different from one another, and each interviewee gave me new things to ponder. In the end, you gain an appreciation for the 'hard problem' of consciousness: how do we account for the subjective experience of consciousness when we've understood many of the 'easy' problems associated with how our brain works (how we learn, memorize, see, hear, emote, etc). We are discovering how the brain functions, but we still can't quite explain how the gray matter awesomely generates/relates to consciousness.The glossary in the back was handy - read it first if you aren't familiar with some of the terminology."
14,0195179595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7331806-rob-adey,4,"Excellent series of interviews with many of the leading/famous figures in consciousness studies (Dennett, the Chalmers zombie guy, Penrose, John Searle, Thomas Metzinger etc.). Blackmore does an excellent job as an interviewer. Although she has her own definite opinions on the subject (she claims to actually experience Dennett's diffuse, bundle-y self), she's open-minded enough to really make sure she her subjects are telling us the truest, clearest explanation of their theories, while still giving them a challenge. As a consequence, there's a lot more nuance here than there might be in a more conventional survey of the field. Plus, you get an entertaining sense of various interesting personalities, plus a fair bit of academic bitchiness.The only thing missing is an interview with Blackmore's husband, Adam Hart-Davis. You just know he's built his own mock-Tudor model of consciousness held together with G-clamps in his shed."
15,0195179595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14835031-osman,4,This book is quite fun to dip into. Many bite-size chapters of separate conversations with the prime-movers in consciousness philosophising over the last few decades. There are some interesting angles pursued and I particularly like the insistence on the ‘freewill’ question and also the way such theorising has an impact on the thinkers everyday life.Unfortunately this will not serve as a great primer on the subject because the nature of conversation is that it rambles from the point and each of the thinkers has their own agenda which is often not germane. Blackmore also has an agenda and sometimes inserts her own thought (not always unhelpfully)I did like the inclusion of Stephen LaBerge who brought up some very interesting practical uses for Lucid Dreaming in the study of consciousness and who also distilled the compatibilist position on freewill down to a very nice sound-bite.Nice bedtime reading- in every sense
16,0195179595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2521766-sushil,4,"Take the most complex conundrums in a field and ask its leading thinkers about them in an informal setting. I would love to read more books in this format. Susan keeps the interviewers on their toes without appearing too confrontational or biased even though she does seem to have a preference for ""robot-geeks"". Ultimately, that small bias seems to be justified since the reader is left with the impression that most thinkers today are leaning towards the view that consciousness and free-will are ride-along features that gives its owners a sense of agency that could very well be entirely unnecessary. Some of the experiments are just stunning. Blindsight - the ability to see without seeing in the standard sense is jaw-dropping in its implications. This is the closest the field has come to showing that a zombie version of us is possible."

I confess I had to struggle a lot while reading it, because I just started to familiarize myself with this subject. There were many things I couldn't understand at first. The book has a useful glossary in the back... but I would recommend that you read an introductory book on consciousness. After reading many interviews, I started to understand better what these persons were trying to say. Also, when I started to read Simon Blackburn's book ""Think"", some things became a little bit more clear... specially the first chapters, which are about the idea of knowledge and mind. I guess Susan Blackmore's book ""Consciousness: A Very Short Introduction"" might help you. Also, if you can read a very short introduction on brain and Descartes, that would help a lot."

There are new ideas on every page although the interview format precludes much depth. This wonderful book could spark a hundred bull sessions.

THey're all asked the same basic questions, so it makes it easy to see where each person stands on the core issues of current consciousness studies. I would recommend this book both to those who are familiar with the debates and arguments behind current cognitive science, and also to those who might want just a more informal introduction to the issue.

Maybe its your ability to use a particular language. Does this make you conscious? But what if you considered a rat or a tiger to have consciousness? Then how would you define it now? So the question to ask is how can I look into your head and confirm this? This book reveals the current debate and struggles scientists and philosophers face in defining what consciousness really is.

I'd probably need to either know more about consciousness in all it's scientific, philosophical and theoretical forms before really being able to get into it. The structure of the discussions sounds interesting, in that she asked a number of different leading figures the same questions. It's apparently based or taken from the idea of a Radio 4 show about it, so I'm considering having a look for that. "

Some are more dogmatic than others, but this is a great read for anyone interested in how we think, or why we think, or whether indeed, we are even here! A good mix of psychology and philosophy from the leading scientific minds in the field."
32,0195179595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3552948-don,5,"Wondeful conversations with 21 philosophers, scientists and psychologists about the problem(s) of human understanding of our own ""consciousness"". It was fascinating to see the range of opinions. A few questions were asked consistently and along the way she roped in the people and really directed questions AT them. Worthy of multiple readings!"
33,0195179595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7328596-kathleen-o-neal,3,"While this book is worthwhile, it could have been greatly improved for me by providing a more accessible introduction to this intriguing but sometimes very technical field of philosophy and neuroscience. I plan to revisit this book after I obtain a stronger philosophy background in this area in the course of my MA program and see what I think about it then."
34,0195179595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8306090-kailin,2,This book can be confusing for a beginner on the topic as it contains many opposing theories and views by experts from various fields. Categorising the book by alphabetical order of their names may not be ideal due to their sometimes antagonistic views. The dissonance can be rather unnerving for a beginner.
35,0195179595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/430924-ashley,4,"I sat down at Barnes and Noble with this recently and read it all in one sitting. She interviews 20 the smartest people alive, so the questions obviously get repetitive, but the answers are varied and provocative. Great minds don't always think alike. "
36,0195179595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1294229-colette,4,"If you want to learn what many experts in the area have to say about what consciouness is or is not, this is very informative. Also like the informality of the interview format, rather than text book style for this topic area."
37,0195179595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1112099-todd,3,Interesting topics but could be better laid out. One of the problems with the field is no one agrees with anyone else and she talks with people who reference others that she covers afterwards. Good book if you want to see the various theories
38,0195179595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4515255-ermina-williams,3,Reading now. It's ok. Too dumbed-down for my taste. But has some interesting references in it. All in all. Buddhist texts on consciousness address many of the same themes but more eloquently. Will finish it though as it's a quick read. 
39,0195179595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6453098-david,3,"Entertaining and though provoking interviews with philosophers and empirical scientists on the topic of (phenomenological) consciousness. Since these are interviews, the topic is explored in a very sketchy manner."
40,0195179595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5092154-jon-gauthier,3,"Great way to get a broad view of the field of consciousness studies in a short amount of time. Lots of good book references for further reading!Be aware that interview quality is highly variable. Highly recommend Churchland (2x), Penrose, Dennett, Searle."
41,0195179595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/252637-martinxo,2,"Concentrates too much on 'its' for my liking, I would have liked to read more about the experience of conciousness."
42,0195179595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2674867-lynn,5,Fantastic! Good picks for the essays in this book.
43,0195179595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5069732-karen,5,Wow! I am loving the heck out of this book!! Wonderful!!!
44,0195179595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12423693-ankit-seth,4,"Some of the interviews can get a tad repetitive. Even so, the merits far outweigh the flaws. You'll definitely learn tons of cool things about the human brain."
45,0195179595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20382814-david-bond,4,Easy & interesting read.

47,0195179595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1913344-michael,5,An excellent introduction to the topics of consciousness. I highly recommend this book and others on the topic of consciousness by Susan Blackmore.
48,0195179595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4333964-jose,3,"Overall consensus: neuroscience is a hot mess and nobody really agrees or knows anything, really. "
49,0195179595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5689960-lambros-fouloulis,2,"Repeats itself since this is a book full of interviews, in which the interviewer often asks the same questions over and over again, when most of the interviewees give the same answer."

51,0195179595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69404894-havziven,4,"yeah.. the book shows us basically that we know almost nothing on the subject of consciousness, we learn throughout the entire book different angles of this mystery different ways and opinions on how we can approach consciousness and what methods can help us figure this thing out.. it is an interesting book nonetheless."
