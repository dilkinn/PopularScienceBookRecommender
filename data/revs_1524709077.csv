I studied Kinesiology and nutrition at UC Berkeley. I ‘knew’ about trans fat and the value of Omega 3’s .... years before most people knew the word. When I put my flax seeds into a grinder to sprinkle them on my salads or other foods just before eating - in the 1970’s, people called me a hippie. I was far from one. Today....its not odd, but collectively if we live in the West....surrounded by temptations of The American ways of eating ....socially - emotionally - and spiritually- we each can benefit to check in within ourselves from time to time.....and ask ourselves.....”how are we doing with our eating”? Our need for education and improvements are endless. Ever notice how each one of us are on own eating path today. Eating in our society is a complicated issue. BUT *sugar* .....the empty calorie ....( no matter how much we like it - which I admit has been my #1 drug of choice my entire life -the drug I’ve had emotional and PHYSICAL battles with) ....is AS ADDICTING- more so - for some people - than cocaine- alcohol- or any other drug on the market. People who know they are sugar addicted - seriously addicted - know who they are. Many can’t eat a drop of the white sugar crystals without real fear of setting themselves up for cravings sooo strong for more....it’s all they can think about. MEAT - and VEGETABLES never cause THAT type of neurotic thinking. SUGAR can do that! There are also MANY GREAT BOOKS on the market which support - educate - and guide people to make healthy choices: So, if it’s support for healthy eating - cook books or guide books - I can share a few that I believe are excellent...BUT THIS BOOK... “The Case Against Sugar”.....probably the best book of its kind ... is The MOST researched. (its not a recipe book), Instead it is ....THE MOST historical book today that we have on the subject of sugar - scientifically proven - real evidence -that SUGAR is THE MAJOR NUMBER ONE DANGEROUS FOOD contributing to a wide range of diseases. Here are just a ‘few’ of those OTHER BOOKS that I own and highly endorse.( remember I studied nutrition and was certified as a nutritional consultant many years ago) - so my library is large.A few of my favorite books: “Clean Eating” by Alejandro Junger,MD, “The Total Health Cookbook” by Joseph Mercola, MD, The Blood Sugar Solution”, by Mark Hyman MD, Joseph Mercola “The No-Grain” diet, “The 21 Day Sugar Detox” is NOT my favorite because I don’t think people know how to use it right. —-ANYTHING that says 21 days ... can be a set up for a failure. But the recipes are fine. I personally - in general - don’t like that old American way of thinking ‘quick fix’.... The title alone feeds into account‘diet’ way of thinking. But with awareness. .... the book ‘might’ work for some people. Often - it’s a set up for the brain to want to be rewarded in 21 Days —- but then that same brain will punish oneself six months later. —- Personally I’m just careful with anything that ‘looks’ or sounds like a diet. Other books I own and like are by: Gary Null’s MD, Pam PeekeMD , Gabriel Cousens MD, GARY TAUBES.MOVING ONTO THIS BOOK.... There are some already excellent reviews. Cliff, your review is outstanding! Thank you! Gary Taubs is highly respected — his work is well researched. He has done a great service in explaining how SUGAR - TABLE SUGAR and high fructose corn syrup in particular have been a major contributor to a host of illnesses in Western society. This book covers the history - OF THE SUGAR INDUSTRY —including its ties to big businesses- our government-and the tobacco industry. Anyone with type 2 diabetes or concerns about getting it .... might seriously read this book. The hardest thing to digest for me - in reading this book.....even though I believe there is a need for a complete change in thinking ---is completely changing the way we celebrate with our SWEET TREATS.....Perhaps one day .... we will no longer celebrate a child’s birthday with cake or ice cream. Perhaps we really don’t need to express our love to each other with a sweetie for our sweetie on Valentines. Maybe the Easter Bunny will deliver real eggs...and perhaps Santa Claus is fat enough and doesn’t need any more cookies. How do we collectively support healthy changes? Little steps at a time .....“THE CASE AGAINST SUGAR”..... could be a terrific non-fiction book club pick so that communication can take place about an issue that affects all us. SUGAR is THAT powerful in our every day lives.....but it’s not an innocent bystander."
1,1524709077,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6011032-michelle-burton,5,"Gary Taubes has done an excellent job in explaining why sugar is so terrible for the body. I am seeing a nutritionist to help me with my weight and on my last visit she stated to me that you can eat any food in moderation. My response to her was, ""What does moderation mean? I guess a person could smoke crack in moderation but no one recommends that."" Taubes stated it clearly in his book that the people who say ""eat in moderation"" typically don't have a weight problem, (and my nutritionist does not) therefore what moderation looks like to one person would look totally different to another. For me, I am staying away from as much sugar as possible. It is in so much foods I don't know if I can totally abstain from it, but I can stop eating the main culprit of sugar delivery systems: candies, cookies, cakes, pop, fruit juices. Y'all, the stuff is deadly and toxic. My father lost a foot to diabetes and another family member kidneys recently failed due to diabetes and high blood pressure. Just like his book Good Calories, Bad Calories convinced me not to eat so much refine carbohydrates, The Case Against Sugar has convinced me to go cold turkey with sugar. Highly recommend all three of his books on nutrition if you want to be in the best health possible."
2,1524709077,http://goodreads.com/user/show/793473-clif-hostetler,5,"This book delves into Western civilization's history with sugar and its increasing rate of consumption since introduction of refined sugar into the Western diet. With this increased consumption also came the economic power of the sugar industry that throughout most of the twentieth century was the funder of nutritional research that tended to focus of causes for Western diseases in directions other that sugar itself.The rate of occurrence of diabetes, heart disease, gout, and a host of other chronic conditions pretty much parallels the rate of increase of sugar consumption. Throughout the twentieth century researchers seemed to want to blame saturated fats and cholesterol but had difficultly establishing links through subsequent health studies. Reluctance to distinguish between complex carbohydrates and simple sugar carbohydrate and refusing to accept the possibility of different metabolism routes for sucrose, fructose and other sugars made nutritional researchers blind to the possible role of sugar.In the manner of a good prosecuting attorney, Taubes in this book lays on layer after layer of additional evidence in making his case against sugar. This data is gleaned from medical history and multiple population studies of the relationship between the consumption of sugar with diabetes and then with all the other medical problems associated with diabetes. Today the American rate of diabetes is nearly one in ten adults, and approximately one in ten children are estimated to have nonalcoholic fatty liver disease which is a precursor of diabetes.I found particularly alarming the concept of ""perinatal metabolic programming"" (a.k.a. metabolic imprinting) as a hypothetical means by which succeeding generations may be more likely to develop diabetes, insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome than is true for today's population.The conditions in the womb—in the intrauterine environment—influence the development of the fetus, so that subtly different conditions will lead, in effect to the birth of newborns who respond differently to the environment they face outside the womb. In particular, the nutrients that the developing child receives in the womb—including the supply of glucose—pass across the placenta in proportion to the nutrient concentration in the mother's circulation. The higher the mother's blood sugar, the greater the supply of glucose to the fetus. The developing pancreas responds by overproducing insulin-secreting cells. ""The baby is not diabetic,"" says Roy Metzger, who studies diabetes and pregnancy at Northwestern University, ""but the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas are stimulated to function and grow in size and number by the environment they're in. So they start over-functioning. That in turn leads to a baby laying down more fat, which is why the baby of diabetic mother is typified by being a fat baby.""I interpreted the above as probably leading to increased sensitivity to the detrimental effects of sugar. However, Taubes elsewhere says it may increase or decrease sensitivity, he's not sure which.I thought once Taubes had established the link between sugar and diabetes that he would be finished. But he proceeds to link heart disease to diabetes through the indirect link of insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome that leads to hypertension. He didn't stop there. He then proceeded to name sugar as the culprit in ALL Western diseases.... if sugar causes insulin resistance and elevates triglycerides and makes us fat, then it very likely causes hypertension, too—if not directly, then at least indirectly, through its effect on insulin resistance and weight. Sugar is the culprit.So here's the if/then hypothesis: If these Western diseases are associated with obesity, diabetes, insulin resistance, and metabolic syndrome, which many of them are, then whatever causes insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome is likely to be the necessary dietary trigger for the diseases, or at least a key player in the causal pathway. Because there is significant reason to believe that sugars—sucrose and high-fructose corn syrup in particular, the nearly fifty-fifty combinations of glucose and fructose—are the dietary trigger of insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome, it's quite likely they are a primary cause of all these Western diseases, including ... cancer and Alzheimer's disease. Without these sugars in the diet, these chronic diseases would be relatively rare, if not, in some cases, virtually nonexistent.At this point Taubes proceeds to address the major Western diseases, one by one, to discuss the likelihood that sugar is responsible, or at least largely responsible. He proceeds to go into a detailed discussion of the hypothetical biochemical mechanisms by which ingestion of sugar can be linked to gout, hypertension, cancer and Alzheimer's disease. Taubes doesn't claim definitive proof according to the rules of science, and indeed it may never be possible to establish absolute proof. But Taubes has certainly laid out a string of circumstantial evidence and mechanisms by which simple sugars can lead to the Western diseases that I find compelling.Taube concludes with a discussion of what is the safe amount of sugar to eat. He says the answer is similar to the answer for tobacco. There is no safe amount for everyone. There are some population studies that have shown that when primitive cultures begin to eat the Western diet that problems begin to appear at about seventy pounds per capita per year of sugar consumption with a twenty year delay in the appearance of symptoms. The FDA in 1986 said forty-two pounds per capita per year was safe. (Current average per capita sugar consumption in USA is over 100 lb/year less losses from discarded food.) But that is a generalized amount for the total population and doesn't account for some individuals who may be maladapted to sugar. Furthermore, future populations may be more (or less) sensitive to sugar than in the past because of perinatal metabolic programming.Here's a link to an article about sugar addiction and withdrawal:https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2017/0...Here's a link to an NPR article titled, ""What The Industry Knew About Sugar's Health Effects, But Didn't Tell Us.""https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/...Here's a link to a NYT article about research on the negative health effects of sugar. One study, from Emory University, found that regular consumption not only of drinks containing added sugars but also of naturally sweet fruit juice raised the risk of an early death by as much as 44 percent. ""...risk for developing heart disease and kidney stones rose in direct proportion to the amount of high-fructose corn syrup they consumed.""https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/22/we..."
3,1524709077,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23080450-emily-crow,3,"Guess what? Sugar is not a healthy food. Who knew? In fact, according to Gary Taubes, it causes just about every ""disease of Western civilization"" and we probably shouldn't eat it at all, which kind of reminded me of all the other nutrition doomsday books I've read over the years:The China Study...don't eat meat or dairy, you will get sick and dieWheat Belly...don't eat wheat, you will get sick and dieEat More, Weigh Less...don't eat fat, you will get sick and dieThe Paleo Solution or any other paleo book...don't eat grains or beans, you will get sick and dieSugar Blues...oh wait, that was sugar again. Two strikes against sugar.So I guess I need to hole up in my nutrition bunker with nothing but vegetables and salad greens, and wait out the food apocalypse, because there's nothing left to eat! But, in all seriousness, I think any reasonable person can concede that sugar--at least in the ginormous amounts it is consumed in our society--is pretty much bad for us. As to just how bad, Gary Taubes is here to explain, and I found a lot that was interesting or valuable in this book. I've read about sugar and metabolic syndrome (potentially leading to type II diabetes, heart disease and other things) before, but Taubes described the process convincingly, and I ran across a couple of new things, like the potential link between high sugar consumption and gout. I also enjoyed the first few chapters about the history of the sugar industry.The second half of the book was not as satisfying for me, though. For one thing, Taubes returned to a couple of his key issues that I've always been a bit skeptical of, such as a complete dismissal of the ""calories in/calories out"" equation for weight loss. I get that it is not quite that simple--a lot of things can go wonky with the metabolism, and the types of foods eaten do make a difference--but at a certain level, yes, if you eat less and/or exercise more, you WILL lose weight, and we all know people who have done that. And then there's the Ancel Keys bashing.... I get it, Taubes thinks Keys was completely wrong with his Seven Countries Study and theory of saturated fat causing heart disease, but honestly, his rancor towards the man comes across like a personal grudge match at times. Especially since I actually do respect Keys' contributions and as far as I'm concerned, the saturated fat versus sugar issue hasn't been resolved yet. Regardless, the Mediterranean diet that Keys ended up espousing is NOT high in sugar and, as far as population studies goes, appears to be quite healthful.Now maybe you are thinking that population studies are of limited use and that Keys cherry-picked the Seven Countries Study to prove his point, and you would be right. Which leads me to my main issue with this book, and why I couldn't give it higher than a three star rating--in the last couple of chapters, Taubes shamelessly cherry-picks population studies to prove his extreme anti-sugar point, focusing on tribal peoples such as the Pima Indians and certain Pacific Islanders. Much closer to home (and much closer to the DNA mix of most of his audience, I'm guessing), I could point out other, conflicting populations, such as the Amish, who eat a lot of sugar (and refined flour) and don't have anywhere near the levels of heart disease and diabetes as the rest of us....Another missed opportunity is that, while Taubes discusses the economics and politics of sugar in the past (even the recent past), he doesn't address the political landscape that has created our current sugar glut. I've lived three places where sugar crops are a major part of the local economy: Hawaii (sugar cane), central Michigan (sugar beets) and currently central Illinois (corn, a.k.a. high fructose corn syrup). I am surrounded by field upon field upon field of mono-crops of genetically modified, pesticide-laden corn, much of it bound for factories to be turned into HFCS and then splattered on just about every processed food in the market at cut-rate prices, so that junk foods are cheaper than fresh vegetables. Because of government farm subsidies. And then the taxpayers are socked again at the end of the cycle, paying for all the health care. But if we all stopped eating this crap, I don't even want to imagine the economic repercussions. It's a messed up system, and it's entirely relevant to the issue of why so many North Americans are sick and obese, and it's barely addressed in this book. Finally, towards the end of the book, the speculation and scare-mongering about sugar reached an almost ridiculous level. Implying that allowing a child to have a single scoop of ice cream per week would be unhealthy? Wondering if we have messed up our health for generations to come by eating sugar? At this point, I just stopped taking the author seriously.But I will admit, at one point he states that the people who say sugar is OK in moderation are the people who don't have a problem with it, and I guess I just proved his point. Despite my many dietary vices, I don't have much of a sweet tooth, and can enjoy a bit of dark chocolate or a creme brulee once in a while. Sugar isn't addictive for me, and I actually find the sweetness of many processed foods kind of off putting. So I guess I would say, if you feel ""hooked"" on sugar, then definitely read this book. Otherwise, it has a few interesting points but ultimately seems a bit overwrought to me."
4,1524709077,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5922426-bam-cooks-the-books--,4,"Having been on a zero-sugar diet for the past three weeks and planning to make it a lifestyle change (see my review of Zero Sugar Diet: The 14-Day Plan to Flatten Your Belly, Crush Cravings, and Help Keep You Lean for Life), I wanted to read a bit more about the science behind the claim that the added sugars in processed foods could possibly be the cause of the current obesity and diabetes epidemic. Intuition, common sense and observation tells one it is true but so many diet fads have come and gone, that a little healthy skepticism is warranted. This book does not provide proof but does give more food for thought (pun intended.) There are very few studies to back up any of this as the big clinical trial money has been focused on shoring up the theory that dietary fat is the main culprit so a leap of faith is still required, I'm afraid, but I have to feel we're on the right track with wholesome, more natural food. Sometimes the simple answer IS the correct one. ""Diet advice that recommends we eat whole foods and avoid processed foods (foodlike substances) remove virtually all refined sugar by definition; diet advice to avoid sugar means, by definition, that we avoid virtually all processed foods."""

6,1524709077,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9888786-ita,5,"‘Medicine is mostly taught untethered from its history,’ asserts Gary Taubes at the beginning of this book. ‘Students are taught what to believe, but not always the evidence on which their beliefs are based.’This book is a much needed history of sugar. I can think of nowhere else where failure to look at the evidence on which medical beliefs are based has had, and continues to have, such tragic consequences.The leading authority who dominated the teaching about diabetes during the twentieth and into the twenty-first century was a dedicated doctor called Elliott Joslin. His textbook, ‘The Treatment of Diabetes Mellitus was first published in 1916. Revered as a bible, its most recent edition appeared in 2005, forty-three years after his death. Joslin argued that fats, and not sugar, were the cause of diabetes. This belief was supported by Harold Himsworth, a very influential diabetes researcher based in London, who in 1931 proposed that a diet rich in carbohydrate should be recommended to diabetics. Both Joslin and Himsworth pointed to Japan as a country where the diet was rich in carbohydrate and low in fat, and where there was very little diabetes. What both men ignored was that sugar consumption in Japan at that time was comparable to that in England and America in the nineteenth century, when diabetes was very rare. They both assumed that sugar and other carbohydrates were equivalent in their effects on the human body.Sugar (sucrose) is formed in plants by the condensation of two simpler sugars – glucose and fructose. Glucose, the molecule into which starches are digested, is used to provide energy. Any surplus is converted, in the liver and muscles, to glycogen (‘animal starch’) for storage until needed. Conversion of glucose to glycogen is under the control of the hormone insulin. Fructose, by contrast, is converted by the liver into fat. Its fat-forming effects seem to be enhanced when glucose is present.Joslin’s and Himsworth’s misconception might have been challenged by the research on metabolism, endocrinology, genetics and nutrition which was taking place in Germany and Austria before the Second World War. Post 1939 this very valuable work was lost to the scientific community. Nutritionists in the English-speaking world focussed on energy balance. A calorie was a calorie no matter where it came from. Putting on weight was simply a matter of consuming more calories than could be expended. Excess weight caused both diabetes and obesity. Diet and exercise were the solutions.When the technique of radioimmunoassay was developed in the 1960s, it brought with it the possibility of measuring hormone levels, and the problem of insulin resistance came to light. Unexpectedly, high insulin levels could accompany high levels of sugar in the blood. Insulin was no longer effective in moving glucose out of the blood and into cells. This pattern was found in people suffering from obesity, and in those who developed diabetes later in life. What caused insulin resistance was then a mystery. It has since been linked to sugar consumption.By the 1950s it was recognised that heart disease was associated with both diabetes and obesity. Whether too much fat or too much sugar caused heart disease was still an open question, and researchers were highly motivated to find an answer. The hypothesis that fat was the murder weapon was supported by the very wealthy and powerful Sugar Association with its Food and Nutrition Advisory Committee. The American Heart Association also came down on the side of fat. It advocated low fat diets for every American, while its researchers were admitting that the dietary fat/heart disease hypothesis needed much more investigation. Those who favoured the sugar hypothesis like John Yudkin in England faced ridicule and the charge of being quacks. In the 1960s Yudkin fed human subjects sugar-rich diets and reported that this increased their cholesterol and triglyceride levels. It seemed to ratchet up their insulin levels and even make their blood platelets sticky.Clinical trials were set up in the US and in Europe to test the fat, but not the sugar hypothesis. To date they have failed to show that high levels of dietary fat cause heart disease, obesity or diabetes. Nevertheless, in 1986 the American government and health organisations committed themselves to getting Americans to eat a low fat diet. Everyone else followed suit. The epidemic of diseases included in metabolic syndrome has only worsened.Gary Taubes cannot prove that sugar is the cause of Western chronic diseases, but the evidence he gives is overwhelming. I have concentrated on some of the scientific aspects, but this book contains much more. It is also as riveting as a good novel. Taubes’ clarity of vision is very rare, and a book like this is worth its weight in gold. "
7,1524709077,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8247780-cres,1,"I could not read this book without getting red faced with frustration every other sentence. One of the most hyperbolic, poorly researched (in terms of actual scientific studies) pieces of hysteria I have read in a long time. The accolades given to Gary Taubes are beyond confusing. His fervent advocacy supported by limited peer reviewed work and even junk science reminds me of another popular cause du jour, the anti-vaxxer movement. The fact that he has taken to consorting with a dangerous self-promoting snake oil salesman like anti-vaccine/anti-mammogram advocate Joe Mercola tells me all that I need to know about his agenda. It isn’t for the betterment of society; it is to stake a claim in a controversial realm that will help enrich himself even if its foundation is built on a bold face lie. As for the book, the constant quoting of 50, 70 and even 100 plus year old newspaper articles or books, detailing the intricacies of how early cereal makers came to add sugar to their product or spending an annoying amount of time explaining how tobacco is processed doesn’t make for actual science or a good read. All it does is give the illusion of it for those too ignorant or lazy to see past the dog and pony show that is The Case Against Sugar. If he spent more time reading actual peer reviewed research, or even conducted some himself, the book would have been better served. Instead he comes in with an agenda on page one and twist and shapes what little research he does present to ensure that it fits into his preconceived box, ignoring what isn't convenient to his argument and using massive amounts of fluff to fill in any gaps and draw unsubstantiated conclusions.On one hand the author claims that science has proved his theories as correct, (they haven’t, in fact an institute he helped found argues against many of his beliefs, oops) and on the other he attacks any and every scientist that disagrees as being a shill for “big sugar”. The outrageous claims he pushes (sugar has killed more people in the last century than war or guns) are ludicrous. He states early on that all, ALL, diseases are caused by sugar “There is clearly enough evidence to indict sugar as the single prominent environmental trigger of disease,”. This sets the stage to be able to make the previous claim that big sugar is essentially committing mass murder on a global scale using the declaration that it is the root cause as proof. All without providing any evidence to back either assertion up.Why after reading this book would anyone take him serious is beyond me. I would posit that most people aren’t actually “reading” the book and understating what he says and, more importantly, doesn’t say. But rather looking for an example to point to while they pat themselves on the back for being so enlightened. Look, we all know sugar is bad when consumed in large amounts. I guess it just isn’t sexy enough to point out that we need to practice much better moderation as we should with all things. It is much easier to come out all crazy like screaming that the sky is falling and suggesting that the government make its use illegal. At least that sells books"
8,1524709077,http://goodreads.com/user/show/83141-jdk1962,4,"I happened to be reading this at the same time as I was listening to a three-part Freakonomics podcast series called ""Bad Medicine,"" and they both hit on the same problem: the emphasis upon ""eminence-based"" medicine, rather than evidence-based medicine, i.e., if a renowned practitioner is behind a hypothesis, that can be enough to direct, or at least influence, decades of research and practice. This is especially critical in the science of sugar, because Taubes' point is that the damage done by sugar is not something that can be easily researched. The damage--if it is indeed caused by sugar--takes not days or weeks but decades to manifest, and it would require literally billions of dollars of research to establish a firm scientific link. But the case that Taubes presents is pretty alarming, especially showing that, as aboriginal peoples are introduced to the ""Western diet,"" a host of ""Western diseases"" start showing up.Taubes' book does a good job of laying out the case, but perhaps falls short in a prescriptive sense. Eat less or no sugar is about the long and short of it. And of course, take the medical advice of those being funded by the sugar industry very, very skeptically. FYI, as someone who works in finance, I thought the quote from C.W. Barron, about investing in vices, was quite interesting, so I actually set up an index focusing on gambling, alcohol, tobacco, and carbonated beverage producers (setting up and testing indices is what I do for a living). In the period from 1999-2016, the annualized return was approximately 3X greater than the S&P500 over the same period, with lower standard deviation and drawdown, and higher Sharpe ratio and dividend yield. So, Barron was on to something...though I'd personally be pretty queasy about investing in such an index."
9,1524709077,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23830021-peter-karlin,1,You will require sugar to stay awake during this book. I've read far more interesting articles on the subject.

It's hard to grasp the huge impact of refined sugar on human evolution, and - once again - thanks to greedy lobbies, we happily march towards our doom, so that the sugar industry barons may continue to enjoy the profits of providing us with our drug of choice. It's unbelievable that governments try to regulate recreational drugs, at the same time when one of the most toxic inventions of humanity is virtually promoted as a healthy alternative to the ""oh-so-dangerous"" fat. I know that all this sounds like a huge overstatement, and I wish it was, but sadly the evidence is here, and choosing not to see it does not make it less valid. Read the book, and weep. But don't eat candy to alleviate the pain (ice cream is kind of OK though - huh?!)Oh, hell, I need to stop reading books on nutritional subjects...

Taubes is a good explainer even if I still wonder about his tendency to zoom in on a particular diet ""vice"" - it was fat and now it's sugar. (His Why We Get Fat was over-simplified almost to the point of inaccuracy, but it turns out to have been a sloppy distillation of his Good Fats, Bad Fats.) This new book doesn't offer self-help advice, but serves several other purposes: a history of sugar and how it entered the human diet, a physiology lesson on human diseases (esp. diabetes and metabolic syndrome), an exposé of the hypocrisies and manipulations of the food industry (e.g. adding sugar to every processed food product), and a critique of how twentieth- and twenty-first century nutrition science has failed to recognize the dangers of dietary sugar. He explains how difficult it is to isolate sugar as the culprit of not only diabetes and obesity but also cancer, high blood pressure, and dementia, but explains why the clues are all there. If ""sitting is the new smoking"" (i.e., is as bad as), then sugar is the new salt, fat, smoking, inactivity (i.e., not only as bad as, but possibly worse than)."
12,1524709077,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12800930-bharath,3,"The title says it all – sugar is not good for us. While that is evident from the title, the book has a great deal of detail and history to back up this claim. Diabetes is rising all over the world. In most countries, the disease is multiplying so rapidly that a significant portion of the population either already has diabetes or is at great risk. Why then is the medical community and governments not really alarmed. As it turns out, research especially in the past has been significantly corrupted with sugar industry sponsored research and also conflicting viewpoints. The evidence which the author quite painstakingly assembles does indicate that sugar is to blame for a number of ailments of modern times including heart ailments, and possibly even cancer. While, most seem to consider fat as the main culprit, in combination with other lifestyle issues such as inadequate exercise, quite possibly sugar has a far greater detrimental impact.I liked the way the case against sugar is built up – with a lot of history, research and statistics. And yet, matter tends to repeat and the book could be been far more crisp for the matter it contains. Some notes on the sugar from natural foods such as fruits could have been discussed.An important book to read nevertheless – definitely recommended."

The epidemiological data associating the increased consumption of sugar with metabolic syndrome was fascinating. Disappointing was the lack of hard scientific studies defining exactly why that is - sucrose and liver are highlighted and vaguely but not conclusively associated with fatty liver. Ponderous was the third of the book vilifying the sugar industry. They're a company selling a legal product making them a hyper villain is just too 1990. Would I recommend this one? No. Just lay off the sugar and corn syrup.

We would never dream of giving kids alcohol or a cigarette, but sugar has nutritional value, so it's OK, right? Not exactly. I credit Dr. Oz for introducing me to the diseases of metabolic syndrome almost 20 years ago. In that episode he also talked about why sugar is so bad for you. Let me paraphrase: eating sugar is like having sharp razor blades tearing up your arteries. Well, that's an image that has never left me. Once I realized just how much sugar was in everything we ate, I removed most of the white and processed foods from our home. Most of the actual sugar too. However, I have a sweet tooth, and that's an understatement. I've given up on sugar, and fallen off the wagon, and then got on again. I've learned much about the formulation of fat, sugar, and salt in foods to create a bliss point (and if you have yet to read that book by Michael Moss, would highly recommend it). This is another book to help my brain cement why I want to get off the sugar ride. I found the history of sugar fascinating, and there is much research and studies covered here that should be talked about on the news daily. Our lack of health is a clear and present danger, and we only seem to be getting sicker, so where is the outrage? There is so much I learned here, like how tobacco soaked in sugar is the technology that made the industry take flight. Sugar is not your friend, and yet somehow we cannot celebrate or mourn or relax or take a breather without a hit. Learning more about the powerful forces behind this industry was eye opening. The reason I deducted a star was because the writing is rather stilted and a bit of slog to get through at times. Still, there are so many sections highlighted in my copy for review. If you've never read about this topic I'd suggest starting with the book mentioned earlier and then make your way here. As an aside, this sweet toothed sugar junkie is off the sugar ride, and it has been way easier than I would have ever believed possible. Now, that is truly sweet."

17,1524709077,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31242781-scott-diamond,3,"This book wasn't what I'd hoped. I do believe we consume too much sugar and that it is detrimental to our health but the evidence provided in this book was far from overwhelming. In fairness. as the author points out, we don't get to conduct the experiment of eating a high sugar diet w/o the rest of the factors of modern western society. The book itself has quite a bit of discussion of the history of sugar, sugar lobby, FDA history etc but it isn't until about 2/3rds through the book that he presents evidence on health issues. Much of the book has info that anyone who has been reading in media has heard before. The author also doesn't address some controversial issues. For example he defines sugar broadly (including high fructose corn syrup). But he doesn't provide guidance on eating fruit. If sugar is as bad as he suggests then wouldn't it follow that we should also not eat very much fruit? This is largely not discussed. The book did get me to reaffirm my desire to eat healthier and the history was somewhat interesting but I didn't get much more than that from it. "

People literally are addicted to sugar and carbs. It's incredible the way food manufactures have destroyed the health of people, especially low income folks. Making them want more and more. The other section of the book I really enjoyed was the first third, which traces the historical connection of sugar - how sugar was made, and the slave industry around sugar, and how sweets relate to the primitive diet. Well researched and clearly written. Get an education - so you know - it is not your fault you love sugar, it's been programmed into your biology, and you are being controlled by monied interests. You cannot avoid sugar until you actually detox from it. Period. But, when you do-- enjoy a feeling of empowerment and freedom beyond anything you have experienced so far. To just have sugar be no big deal anymore. Wouldn't that be lovely? "

The author's goal is to link the sugar industry's cover up of the enormous damage that sugar has done to what the tobacco industry did with smoking. The old Watergate question of What did they know and when did they know it is especially apt. I read Sugar Blues in the 70's and it was an attack on sugar; this is more an attack on an industry that knew the damage they were doing but there was too much money involved for them to stop. It's also an indictment of a scientific community that can be paid off. It is very much worth the read.
20,1524709077,http://goodreads.com/user/show/196558-denise-cormaney,5,"Every American needs to read this book.This isn't a diet book. There are no diet plans, no recipes, nothing about losing weight. He isn't a doctor trying to get rich by selling a book based on the latest food craze. Taubes is a science writer, and he presents evidence to prove that sugar is the cause of every modern disease in the Western world. Sound like an exaggeration? It isn't. He makes a solid case.Unless you have gone deep into the research yourself, you probably believe what we've all been told: -Sugar is essentially harmless. Yes, you shouldn't eat a lot because it is ""empty calories"" and has no nutritional value. You don't want too many of your daily calories spent on food that doesn't have any essential vitamins and minerals. But in moderation, there's nothing wrong with the occasional sweet treat as long as the rest of your diet is ""healthy"". (wrong)-People who are obese eat too much and move too little. It's all about energy balance (calories in/calories out). (wrong)-Dietary fat causes chronic disease (obesity, heart disease, cancer); specifically butter, eggs, dairy, and fatty meats. You order your pancakes with a side of turkey bacon, thinking you're making a healthy choice. (wrong)This book is dense with facts, but it is a compelling read. Parts of it made me *so* angry. People, we have been lied to, and it's killing us. Taubes gives us the history of the sugar lobby (which Franklin Roosevelt called ""the most powerful pressure group that has descended on the national capital during our lifetime."" In the '60s, the Silver Anvil Award went to the Madison Avenue firm the Sugar Association hired to wage a sugar-defense campaign. The award was for ""the forging of public opinion."" The purpose of that campaign? To assure the public that sugar is safe. In 1964 a Scottish physician was quoted in The Lancet as saying: ""The refining of sugar may yet prove to have been a greater tragedy for civilized man than the discovery of tobacco."") They used their influence to suppress scientific research and to sway politicians to affect public policy. The parallels to the tobacco industry are clear. It's infuriating when you read the studies and the history that Taubes presents in this book.But we expect industries to make money at the expense of the public. The part that was really infuriating was how the NIH has played a major role in this. They had studies dating from the '40-'60s that showed it was sugar, not dietary fat, that raises triglycerides. They had studies showing that too much sugar causes metabolic syndrome. But here's the pivotal moment that got us to where we are now: in the late 1960's, the NIH set out to confirm this hypothesis: ""a low-fat diet plus blood pressure medication will help people live longer."" In 1982 they published the results, and THEY FAILED TO CONFIRM THE HYPOTHESIS. Men on low-fat diets suffered MORE deaths than men who ate more fat. They ran a second trial using cholesterol-lowering meds, and published the results in 1984. The results showed that the meds helped, but just barely. Based on that study alone, the NIH, concerned about deaths from heart disease, ASSUMED that if a cholesterol-lowering drug helped reduce deaths, it should be the recommendation for all people over the age of two to eat a low-fat diet. They undertook a massive public relations campaign to sell a low-fat, high-carb diet, and we've been living with the consequences ever since. The NIH did the study again, this time with women, starting in the early '90s. They published their results in 2006, and once again, they failed to confirm the hypothesis. MORE WOMEN DIED EATING A LOW-FAT DIET, one with whole grains and less red meat, than women who ate more fat. And yet the official recommendations haven't changed. You can thank the sugar lobby for that. They benefit from our collective ignorance.And can't we see that this is true? All we have to do is look around and see that we are getting more and more unhealthy. Think this sounds crazy? Try giving up all sugar for a week (read your labels, it's in everything) and see how you feel. That first week will be HARD, because you are addicted. It's as addicting as cocaine. As someone who has struggled with weight, this book confirmed what I know to be true from personal experience. It's not about eating less. Some people are genetically predisposed to being sensitive to sugar. If you are, then you will have a hormonal, metabolic response to sugar that will only get worse over time. Your body will secrete too much insulin, which will then cause you to store those calories as fat. That body fat then secretes its own hormones, putting you into a state called Metabolic Syndrome. No amount of calorie reduction will lead to permanent weight loss. Eventually your body will become insulin-resistant. This is why you can eat a low-fat diet of only 1200 calories and exercise everyday, and still remain overweight! If you restrict calories you may lose weight at first, but you will gain it all back (just google ""The Biggest Loser contestants"" and read about how they've all ended up heavier than when they started.)Taubes also gives evidence that sugar is at the root of cancer and dementia. He has less evidence to present here (compared to the overwhelming evidence tying sugar to heart disease and diabetes), but he does have peer-reviewed, scientific studies to back up these claims. The research here is new and still emerging, but the correlation is undeniable (i.e. cancer and dementia are nearly nonexistent in cultures that don't eat a Western diet, but then appear within one-to-two generations when a culture adopts a Western diet). I know this is a bummer. We love our sweets. We can't imagine celebrating a birthday without a cake, or Christmas without a gajillion treats. We associate love and comfort with our favorite foods, with Grandma's cookies. I'm the same way. We think that this is how we've always done things, but as you'll read in this book, refined sugar hasn't been around that long. Maybe if we can wean ourselves off sugar, we could get to a place where we truly only eat it a few times a year. (Could a former smoker have a cigarette only two or three times a year...? Is that even possible?) Sigh.Every American needs to read this book."

If this were a criminal case, The Case Against Sugar would be the argument for the prosecution
And if I were the judge in the case, I would probably struggle to resist turning up for the first day in court wearing a black cap to signal the pre-ordained outcome of the trial – an outcome the cover of the book anticipates with its sugary noose. My own distillation of current wisdom on diet would probably be something like “everything in moderation, except refined sugar which you should avoid as much as you can”. So I am predisposed towards the arguments of this book, which would go even further than my initial fears about sugar, by seeking to pin almost all modern/Western illnesses (gout, hypertension, even cancer and Alzheimer’s) back to sugar via its effects on insulin resistance and disturbances on hormonal and metabolic processes.Nevertheless I struggled when reading this book. Were it a court case of course Taubes own witnesses would be subject to cross examination by the defense, and the defense case itself would be presented (with Taubes having the opportunity to cross examine their witnesses, but with those witnesses being able to respond to that cross examination).Instead we get a one sided case – with witnesses (normally nutritionists or those in the associated fields of medical science) for the defense quoted selectively and with their conclusions and motives (normally that they are in some way funded by the sugar or associated industry – either to defend that industry or to deflect blame elsewhere, most successfully to dietary fats) impugned by the prosecution; whereas witnesses for the prosecution (effectively drawn from the same bodies, albeit with more emphasis on medical scientists than nutritionists who Taubes believe lack the rigour of the scientific method) given a free ride (we are for example never told if any of their work was funded by those industries associated with dietary fats) and some of their studies are blatantly subject to the same faults (often selective sampling or confirmation bias) as those Taubes criticises.Taubes also I feel lacks sometimes scientific rigour – the very fact he accuses other (particularly nutritionists of). He applies the principle of Occam’s razor to argue against a multi-factor (for example bad cholesterol fats, sedentary lifestyles) cause of Western illnesses – arguing the principle means you should seek for only a single cause. As a statistician I struggle with this conclusion when it is not backed up by some form of multi-variate analysis. He also seems to confuse correlation with causality and this (like his Occam’s razor approach) is crucial to his refection of a multi-factor cause.And the book is much the weaker for these two faults – as despite the overwhelming evidence I wanted to hear the counter arguments and weigh them up for myself. I was reminded in this respect of a number of books on man made climate change – where despite being pre-disposed towards their conclusions their selective polemic actually meant the books made me more rather than less unsure of them by the time.So overall definitely an important book – for anyone who is a sugar-is-bad sceptic (or thinks there is no difference between a sugar calorie and another calorie) I would strongly recommended it. For those already convinced of the sugar-is-bad hypothesis you will find much here to confirm your views (if that is what you are after) but little to help you test and (if I can be pardoned the pun) refine them."
22,1524709077,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10369370-nicole,3,"You’re not gonna like this. But in your heart, you already know it’s true. Sugar is killing us. Slowly. It takes years and even decades to see its full effect, and that’s what makes it so insidious. After year of eating with apparent impunity, it ends in diabetes, heart disease, cancer, and Alzheimer’s. Taubes, taking an epidemiological approach to the subject, subscribes to the theory of sugar as a hormonal regulatory disrupter that has a different metabolic effect than other substances. That is, a calorie of sugar is not equal to other calories - it changes the way the body stores fat and leads to insulin resistance, a precursor to the metabolic syndrome that’s responsible for a whole host of chronic diseases. While most observers just fat-shame people for overindulging and taking in too many calories, lab studies with rats show that even when keeping calorie intake the same, the rats who had sugar still gained weight, vs those who did not. Taubes is particularly strong when he explores the role the sugar industry has played in skewing scientific research and public opinion to avoid blame for America’s health catastrophe (to include speciously discrediting artificial sweeteners.) So why only 3 stars? For starters, the bookis incredibly tedious. But also, while I completely agree that sugar is a primary cause of poor health in America, I think it’s too simplistic to boil it down to being the only cause. Nutrition is incredibly complex, and there are so many deficiencies in the diets produced by our highly processed, industrialized food system that other factors (such as saturated fat, refined flours, and sodium) cannot be completely ruled out as co-contributors. "
23,1524709077,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2199404-andy,4,"Taubes is a very good writer and makes a good case against sugar, but he already did that in two previous books. What he adds here is some more explanation of why the authorities keep saying sugar is not the problem even in instances where the evidence shows that it clearly is. He also makes a good argument about if sugar is the main culprit behind metabolic syndrome, then it's a big deal for lots of diseases other than just obesity itself. He even makes a solid argument for sugar's role in the lung cancer pandemic. I think he pushes things too far when he reacts against Big Junk's use of multi-factor causality as an excuse to dismiss sugar's role. Sugar can be one cause and even the major cause, AND there can still be other causes (stress, plastics, microbiome, whatever). I think he could get more people on his side by settling for sugar as A cause vs. THE cause. But I can understand his frustration when all these authorities are still, for example, telling diabetic people that toast with maple syrup is a good breakfast, and still pushing cereal with sugared non-fat milk for schoolchildren. Given that the book is called ""The case against sugar"" I think it's OK that he's not bending over backward to be even-handed. "
24,1524709077,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1045774-mehrsa,4,"I literally stopped eating sugar the second I finished this book, but ahh my kids are addicted. I think if I were to pick one Taubes book, it would be the why we get fat book because it has better research. he makes a lot of crazy claims here that are unsupported, but that I guess I kind of buy. I mean, I don't think sugar causes cancer and alzheimers because those diseases started appearing once we started eating sugar. We started eating lots of sugar after we took care of the plague and other diseases so now we live long enough for cancer to kill us off. But does sugar make us fat? sure. Also, I'm surprised he doesn't talk much about Nelson Aldrich in his sugar history. The dude was crazy corrupt and controlled the senate and was a huge sugar mogul. I'm sure he's relevant in the origin story of why sugar was not vilified early in the century"
25,1524709077,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9555257-maria,3,"The basic premise of this book is that sugar is toxic in large amounts, and the modern diet in the United States and many other nations across the globe now incorporates far too much sugar. The primary disease of concern is diabetes, and Taubes provides a reasonably extensive history of the occurrence of diabetes and the evolution of medical theories about its primary cause. For a variety of reasons - the sugar industry being one, human stubborness being another - fat was considered the culprit for a very long time, during which time sugar insinuated itself into nearly everything we eat. It is an effective preservative, it tastes delicious, but perhaps it is poison.By the end of the book I'd grown weary; in part because it is an emotionally exhausting mental exercise to consider how so much of the food you enjoy eating is quite possibly killing you slowly, but also because Taubes never let up beating on his long dead horse. Sugar causes diabetes! And hypertension! And heart disease! And CANCER! As if the first ailment wouldn't be enough to scare us.That said, it has helped me to begin to perceive sugary foods a bit differently. For those who turn to food for comfort or stress relief or enjoyment, those feelings cannot be experienced the same way knowing what's in store. I won't eliminate sugar from my diet, but I think I probably will reduce my sugar intake by a good deal, saving it for special occasions. All things in moderation, after all."

I still eat a chocolate chip cookie whenever I see one (since they’re amazing). And it’s not sustainable for me to completely cut sugar out of my life. But I feel like I’ve gotten my addiction under control. This book reinforced the importance of that effort.I put this book in the same category as “Why We Sleep.” We are still learning a lot about the science of health. However, there are some things we know are generally correlated with good health. Get enough sleep. Don’t eat too much. Limit sugar. Eat fresh rather than processed foods. Eat your vegetables. Limit chocolate to 3 lbs per day...ok, maybe not that last one. Anyway, my guess is that the specifics of how to stay healthy will change. But it’s good to know what will generally lead to better health."

And a more accurate title for the last half would be ""Sugar is the Devil.""I enjoyed the first half of this. The historical details were fascinating. The author showed not just the history of sugar, but he also showed that when sugar became prevalent in many cultures across the the globe, disease soon followed. This part was a solid 4 stars for me.Then the last half kind of unraveled a bit. It jumped around a lot to different topics. There wasn't as much research and some of it seemed dated. I did page math a few times. Sugar is the villain here, along with the Sugar Association. But the fact that sugar isn't good for us isn't new information. Some new info/research would have been appreciated. Overall, I liked the history and the spin the author put on his platform. So 3 starsThis is my take on health books of this nature. There is always some platform. There is always an enemy. We are all going to die. Associations (like the Sugar Association, United Egg Association, the National Dairy Council, etc.,) are like teenagers when they speak.....YOU HAVE TO READ BETWEEN THE LINES. Of course they want to be looked upon in a rosy glow, but not all things that come from their direction is truth. They want you to buy what they are selling. Books of this nature are kind of the same...I feel I have to read between the lines. But I like the research and I like the spin they put on their platform.

It's very hard to feel good about eating 70% of the foods one might normally eat while listening to this book, I can't really speak on the books effect afterwards as it hasn't been long. It is eye-opening though just to come to terms with how sugar has affected me in so many different ways at pivotal moments in my life. Unfortunately it also brings to bear the same old story that underlines every industry's political past in the United States: conflict of interest. I'm starting to feel like I can't trust anything in this country as it has undoubtedly been so manipulated by duplicitous science, political manipulation, and downright lies, that there is no telling which way is what.That being said, Taubes is definitely totally against sugar, and proposes we eliminate it entirely from our diets, much as someone trying to quit smoking would have to eliminate the habit entirely instead of cutting down. This seems extreme to me, and for me personally very difficult, but I think he might just be right. "

For example, did you know the nutritionists at the cereal companies fought for years to keep sugared-cereals off the market because they knew how devastating they could be for kids? And did you know that cigarette smoking became popular and created the lung-smoking epidemic AFTER sugar-curing became popular? Soaking the tobacco leaves in sugar water before they were cured made the cigarettes taste better and made them more addictive. There's been a lot of news lately about how the sugar companies worked to keep nutritionists focused on fat being to blame for the rise in obesity and diabetes rates rather than sugar. Now we know that sugar consumption plays a major role in both. And it's harder and harder to avoid not only sugar, but all the multiple sugar substitutes, too, because it's in everything. Taubes explains all of this in a way that's easy to understand so you don't lose any of that continually building anger. "

The problem with this book is that it may be a little too intense for the average reader, or maybe I should say the book isn't dumbed down enough for the general American public. Having said that, there is a wealth of information here, including a history of the sugaring of tobacco which I had not previously known. To think smoking wasn't bad enough already, they had to add sugar to it. The author is preaching to the choir with me because I already believe that I am a sugar addict and the only way to control my sugar addiction is to stay away from it as much as possible. On the other hand, most of the people I know can handle sugar in moderation, so I'm not so sure it can be lumped in with other substances which are so harmful, like tobacco, alcohol, and other drugs. I do agree that the sugar industry has an incredible hold over the powers that be and that it is dangerous to the public health in general and that we all pay the price for the damage it does. "

While I found the overall argument quite convincing, what I found lacking, surprisingly, was a definition of what sugar is. Taubes thoroughly explains that high-fructose corn syrup is quite similar to sucrose in composition (55% fructose as opposed to 50%), which was helpful. But I'm still confused about effects of sugar described throughout the book being attributed to glucose vs fructose, especially regarding glycemic index effects. Furthermore, the author sometimes discussed consumption of ""sweets,"" but I'd thought a reason sugar consumption has increased so drastically is its increased amounts in processed foods we don't typically consider sweet. The epilogue emphasizes that this is not a proscriptive book, but I found it so theoretical about such a practical topic that it didn't live up to its potential for me."

Ugh!Let's start with the reading and recording of this book.... To say that it read like a text book would be saying it kindly... The reading was very dry and borderline boring. The material was extremely technical and required me to rewind repeatedly in order to refocus and relisten to what was being said. This is a heavy book - both with the depth and scope of knowledge in multiple disciplines including medical, health, socioeconomic, and food. So prepare yourselves for an in depth dive into the world of the human body and how it functions. I would have given this book a 5-star rating if it weren't so very dryly written; otherwise, what I learned has left me speechless. I would easily say that if you want to learn about sugar and how it impacts the human body then this is definitely the book to read or listen to. I learned more than I ever thought possible about what sugar does in the body and to the body. I must say that this book presents the facts very well with lots of historical and scientific evidence to back its points and arguments. I found the material well put together and presented. A large focus of the book was on Diabetes and its relationship with sugar and other ""Western"" Diseases. Since my husband was diagnosed with type 2 Diabetes a year ago, the information in this book was critical and relevant to my family's needs. I learned a lot of important information that I can utilize in our home to help my husband deal with, and hopefully beat, this disease. I highly recommend this book to everyone and anyone who wants to learn about a healthier live style of eating and living. This book is especially pertinent to everyone who is currently suffering from various diseases that are classified as a ""western"" disease such as diabetes, high blood pressure, pre-diabetes, and even cancer.... this book sheds light on a lot of issues that the general public seems to be in the dark about. Ignore the dryness of the writing and read the book for the content - I believe it's priceless information. Good Luck and Happy Reading!"
53,1524709077,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16197762-leanna-pohevitz,4,"Well, if this book doesn’t make you rethink your eating habits I’m not sure what might. It is probable that sugar leads to, disease susceptibility, Alzheimers, cancer, gout, diabetes, heart disease and obesity. I will attempt to change some things about my diet, for sure. I love how well researched this book was, all the studies he quotes and how he looks at the affect of a western diet on indigenous populations that adopted it (often because they were forced to). The evidence shows, there is a pretty strong case against sugar."
54,1524709077,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21346273-carrie,5,"This book was terrifying, in a good way (I think). It all seems so commonsense to me, but at the same time it truly is hard to avoid sugar altogether - after all, what is a Birthday without a cake? Lol. But finding out a balance with little to no sugar is worth it in the long run, as Gary Taubes has laid out all of the reasons to make the change in this book.I was very intrigued by the history of how the sugar industry has taken such advantage of the world. It is scary how money has made us so unhealthy, ill and caused far too many premature deaths via cancer and etc. This was a great read, and I feel that all humans should read it. It did take me about 3 weeks to read, (2 months if you count the breaks I took). It is a lot of information to understand, names to remember, and facts to digest. Gary Taubes' research shouldn't be brushed aside. It is a game changer and truly could save your life!"
55,1524709077,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40175257-christy,4,"Sugar has drastically changed the health of the human race. Or has it? This book gives many, many examples of groups of people throughout history who were introduced to sugar and what happened to their health. And also how it has become an ingredient in just about everything. The thing is though, that there is no way to prove that anything is actually caused by sugar, because it is usually paired with one or multiple other potentially harmful factors, hence the name of the book, The Case Against Sugar. You can't prove it, but he can argue his case. I liked this book and it will definitely make me try to consume less sugar. But as in everything, I think moderation is key. Especially when it is extremely difficult to avoid sugar (and I don't mean just treats, it's in lunch meat) in our culture. The book does drag on a bit, but it is filled with a lot of great information and ideas."
56,1524709077,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30261451-celia,4,"Sugar is dangerous and addictive!! It causes more chronic diseases tan you might think.It even contributes to the bad effects of smoking. Before tobacco was being soaked in sugar water to make it more easily inhalable, it was just chewed. Now smokers inhale and the result is possibly emphysema, bronchitis and lung cancer.And, if I understand the book correctly, sugar also causes:Hypertension - caused by sugar, not salt.Heart disease - caused by sugar because it changes the metabolism of triglycerides and fatty deposits can occur in arteries. Obesity - too many calories Diabetes - caused by obesityGout - caused by diabetesInsulin Resistance exacerbates diabetesSounds like I should eliminate sugar from my diet. Hope it's not too late."
57,1524709077,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13091714-anna,3,"Interesting and quite convincing information about the many serious diseases and disorders which are quite possibly caused by and are certainly exacerbated by consumption of sugar. The trouble with the book is that is is extremely repetitive. By the third of fourth chapter I was quickly growing bored by the details of his arguments because they seemed to be the same details as the argument made three or four times in the chapters previous. On the other hand the weight of evidence compiled makes a very good case and I will need to be even more vigilant in seeking to reduce sugar from my diet. Realistically I don't think I could ever entirely eliminate it as the author suggests would be best, at least not unless society in general makes that more possible."
58,1524709077,http://goodreads.com/user/show/895848-ventzi,5,"A definite must-read. The research is thorough and convincing, without the presentation being patronising or prescriptive.What I like best for myself is how this book gives me one more point of view to a number of events in the history of science, and so convinces me of the truthfulness of the relayed facts, as well as to ignore most of current main-stream nutrition advice, making my own conclusions and decisions instead.For me, the case against sugar is overwhelming. The sad and pitiful fact, however, is that there is no definite research being funded to figure out why and how exactly sugar may be in the roots of our bodies starting to malfunction in various ways."
59,1524709077,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3183576-cheri,5,"A real tour de force on the part of the author. The most fascinating part of this book is how we come to believe what we do about how things work, and how constant repetition of something can make it ""true."" (It's definitely a lesson for our times in many ways.) I have long doubted many things I learned in school (I'm a dietitian), but Taubes convinced me that sugar is probably even worse than I had thought. He is careful to make clear that there's so much we don't know, and may never know, but that doesn't mean there isn't a reasonable course of action. I do wish he would have discussed white wheat flour and its relation to refined sugar -- maybe his next book?"
60,1524709077,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31879056-peggy-haslar,4,"A total eye-opener. The first section on the history of sugar is simply devastating. Then, how government helped subsidize our addiction and change our tastes. Really valuable read."
61,1524709077,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13244359-donna,3,"A more accurate title for the first half would be ""The History of Sugar."" And a more accurate title for the last half would be ""Sugar is the Devil.""I enjoyed the first half of this. The historical details were fascinating. The author showed not just the history of sugar, but he also showed that when sugar became prevalent in many cultures across the the globe, disease soon followed. This part was a solid 4 stars for me.Then the last half kind of unraveled a bit. It jumped around a lot to different topics. There wasn't as much research and some of it seemed dated. I did page math a few times. Sugar is the villain here, along with the Sugar Association. But the fact that sugar isn't good for us isn't new information. Some new info/research would have been appreciated. Overall, I liked the history and the spin the author put on his platform. So 3 starsThis is my take on health books of this nature. There is always some platform. There is always an enemy. We are all going to die. Associations (like the Sugar Association, United Egg Association, the National Dairy Council, etc.,) are like teenagers when they speak.....YOU HAVE TO READ BETWEEN THE LINES. Of course they want to be looked upon in a rosy glow, but not all things that come from their direction is truth. They want you to buy what they are selling. Books of this nature are kind of the same...I feel I have to read between the lines. But I like the research and I like the spin they put on their platform. However, I need the research for it to worth my while. So 3 stars."
62,1524709077,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1229150-kristina,2,"I'm going to be honest - this book was so boring. Plenty of times I felt like giving up but instead I just kept plugging along through it- halfway getting it and the other half ignoring it. If you don't read it let me tell you what it says- sugar isn't awesome, the sugar industry has manipulated things so it is now so prevalent that you can't get away from it - and pretty much all our health maladies would be cured if we stopped eating it. Also I ate jelly beans that I stored in my pocket on my way to work this morning. Gary Taubs would shame me for this - instead I laugh in the face of danger."
63,1524709077,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53450768-michael,4,"An excellent, very deeply researched book about the history of Sugar's rise to prominence as a food additive in the western diet, and as a public health crisis. It's very hard to feel good about eating 70% of the foods one might normally eat while listening to this book, I can't really speak on the books effect afterwards as it hasn't been long. It is eye-opening though just to come to terms with how sugar has affected me in so many different ways at pivotal moments in my life. Unfortunately it also brings to bear the same old story that underlines every industry's political past in the United States: conflict of interest. I'm starting to feel like I can't trust anything in this country as it has undoubtedly been so manipulated by duplicitous science, political manipulation, and downright lies, that there is no telling which way is what.That being said, Taubes is definitely totally against sugar, and proposes we eliminate it entirely from our diets, much as someone trying to quit smoking would have to eliminate the habit entirely instead of cutting down. This seems extreme to me, and for me personally very difficult, but I think he might just be right. "
64,1524709077,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9791216-sara,5,"This book will make you shout out loud in complete outrage -- like I often did years ago when I read Susan Faludi's ""Backlash."" For example, did you know the nutritionists at the cereal companies fought for years to keep sugared-cereals off the market because they knew how devastating they could be for kids? And did you know that cigarette smoking became popular and created the lung-smoking epidemic AFTER sugar-curing became popular? Soaking the tobacco leaves in sugar water before they were cured made the cigarettes taste better and made them more addictive. There's been a lot of news lately about how the sugar companies worked to keep nutritionists focused on fat being to blame for the rise in obesity and diabetes rates rather than sugar. Now we know that sugar consumption plays a major role in both. And it's harder and harder to avoid not only sugar, but all the multiple sugar substitutes, too, because it's in everything. Taubes explains all of this in a way that's easy to understand so you don't lose any of that continually building anger. "
65,1524709077,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33043250-biggus,5,"If you love your kids, and want your grandkids (especially the ones that haven't been born yet) to live happy and healthy lives, you need to do two things.1. Read this book.2. Heed this book.This book is the most accessible of Taubes' writings. It is a simple and compelling story, one that is so obviously basically true, that it drives me insane that people just can't see it.""All truth passes through three stages. First, it is ridiculed. Second, it is violently opposed. Third, it is accepted as being self-evident.""We are JUST coming out of the first stage. I just wonder how many will have to die before we get to stage three. :("

The emphasis on the addictive nature of sugar is key to our understanding its role in our lives.As a practicing physician I have had incredible success with my patients teaching them about the concepts in this book. I have had patients resolve all of the parameters of metabolic syndrome by eliminating sugar and sometimes both sugar and starch from their diet."
67,1524709077,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5-elizabeth,0,"I listened to this on audiobook. Coming from personal experience as well as from reading this book, I do think that sugar in large qualities is damaging our bodies and I'm concerned. It will be telling to see how our generation fares in the coming years regarding illnesses such as diabetes, arthritis, pancreatic issues and other systemic problems. It's shocking how much sugar is used as an additive to thicken things or just to amplify flavor. My doctor recommended giving it up entirely, which is extremely challenging to do. Sigh..."
68,1524709077,http://goodreads.com/user/show/301768-judith,3,"This is an extremely well-researched and thorough analysis of the case against sugar. The problem with this book is that it may be a little too intense for the average reader, or maybe I should say the book isn't dumbed down enough for the general American public. Having said that, there is a wealth of information here, including a history of the sugaring of tobacco which I had not previously known. To think smoking wasn't bad enough already, they had to add sugar to it. The author is preaching to the choir with me because I already believe that I am a sugar addict and the only way to control my sugar addiction is to stay away from it as much as possible. On the other hand, most of the people I know can handle sugar in moderation, so I'm not so sure it can be lumped in with other substances which are so harmful, like tobacco, alcohol, and other drugs. I do agree that the sugar industry has an incredible hold over the powers that be and that it is dangerous to the public health in general and that we all pay the price for the damage it does. "
69,1524709077,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13385989-lisa,2,"This book successfully does make a case against sugar, focusing on the history of the case. While I found the overall argument quite convincing, what I found lacking, surprisingly, was a definition of what sugar is. Taubes thoroughly explains that high-fructose corn syrup is quite similar to sucrose in composition (55% fructose as opposed to 50%), which was helpful. But I'm still confused about effects of sugar described throughout the book being attributed to glucose vs fructose, especially regarding glycemic index effects. Furthermore, the author sometimes discussed consumption of ""sweets,"" but I'd thought a reason sugar consumption has increased so drastically is its increased amounts in processed foods we don't typically consider sweet. The epilogue emphasizes that this is not a proscriptive book, but I found it so theoretical about such a practical topic that it didn't live up to its potential for me."
70,1524709077,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27285494-roberta,3,"In the beginning I was like ""Hell yeah, sugar is evil, tell them that, Gary!!!1!1!!"" and the first half of the book was truly interesting. But as it went on the examples and concepts that were described started to seem repetitive. Most notable ones were:*Sugar industry funds research to prove that sugar isn't bad for your health*Some scientists put blame on dietary fat*Indigenous communities get increasingly fatter and more sick as they adopt the Western diet*Sugar is fed to rats; rats get fat and die*Silly nutritionists say that ""a calorie is a calorie""I mean, I agree with Gary 100% and this book was nothing if not well researched, but MAAAAAAAAN it eventually got just too damn repetitive and what at first had to be 5 stars by the end dropped to 3."

It's very hard to feel good about eating 70% of the foods one might normally eat while listening to this book, I can't really speak on the books effect afterwards as it hasn't been long. It is eye-opening though just to come to terms with how sugar has affected me in so many different ways at pivotal moments in my life. Unfortunately it also brings to bear the same old story that underlines every industry's political past in the United States: conflict of interest. I'm starting to feel like I can't trust anything in this country as it has undoubtedly been so manipulated by duplicitous science, political manipulation, and downright lies, that there is no telling which way is what.That being said, Taubes is definitely totally against sugar, and proposes we eliminate it entirely from our diets, much as someone trying to quit smoking would have to eliminate the habit entirely instead of cutting down. This seems extreme to me, and for me personally very difficult, but I think he might just be right. "

For example, did you know the nutritionists at the cereal companies fought for years to keep sugared-cereals off the market because they knew how devastating they could be for kids? And did you know that cigarette smoking became popular and created the lung-smoking epidemic AFTER sugar-curing became popular? Soaking the tobacco leaves in sugar water before they were cured made the cigarettes taste better and made them more addictive. There's been a lot of news lately about how the sugar companies worked to keep nutritionists focused on fat being to blame for the rise in obesity and diabetes rates rather than sugar. Now we know that sugar consumption plays a major role in both. And it's harder and harder to avoid not only sugar, but all the multiple sugar substitutes, too, because it's in everything. Taubes explains all of this in a way that's easy to understand so you don't lose any of that continually building anger. "

It will be telling to see how our generation fares in the coming years regarding illnesses such as diabetes, arthritis, pancreatic issues and other systemic problems. It's shocking how much sugar is used as an additive to thicken things or just to amplify flavor. My doctor recommended giving it up entirely, which is extremely challenging to do. Sigh..."
98,1524709077,http://goodreads.com/user/show/301768-judith,3,"This is an extremely well-researched and thorough analysis of the case against sugar. The problem with this book is that it may be a little too intense for the average reader, or maybe I should say the book isn't dumbed down enough for the general American public. Having said that, there is a wealth of information here, including a history of the sugaring of tobacco which I had not previously known. To think smoking wasn't bad enough already, they had to add sugar to it. The author is preaching to the choir with me because I already believe that I am a sugar addict and the only way to control my sugar addiction is to stay away from it as much as possible. On the other hand, most of the people I know can handle sugar in moderation, so I'm not so sure it can be lumped in with other substances which are so harmful, like tobacco, alcohol, and other drugs. I do agree that the sugar industry has an incredible hold over the powers that be and that it is dangerous to the public health in general and that we all pay the price for the damage it does. "

While I found the overall argument quite convincing, what I found lacking, surprisingly, was a definition of what sugar is. Taubes thoroughly explains that high-fructose corn syrup is quite similar to sucrose in composition (55% fructose as opposed to 50%), which was helpful. But I'm still confused about effects of sugar described throughout the book being attributed to glucose vs fructose, especially regarding glycemic index effects. Furthermore, the author sometimes discussed consumption of ""sweets,"" but I'd thought a reason sugar consumption has increased so drastically is its increased amounts in processed foods we don't typically consider sweet. The epilogue emphasizes that this is not a proscriptive book, but I found it so theoretical about such a practical topic that it didn't live up to its potential for me."

It makes a fantastic case against sugar, which leads me to conclude, personally, that avoiding it is the best way to avoid metabolic syndrome (and as Taubes notes, the insulin resistance and high triglycerides that characterize metabolic syndrome are precursors to most common modern maladies).But while I wholeheartedly agree that the food industry has done us a terrible service by highly refining grains and pumping them, as well as various other (often supposedly savory) products with sugar and HFCS, I find the condemnation of birthday cake and so on unrealistic. What's done is done. People emotionally respond to certain foods, and even if the food wreaks havoc on the body, we are all going to die sometime, so sugar must retain a place in the cultural consciousness, however limited. In conclusion: yes to avoiding sugar in everyday products, cutting out dessert, embracing whole grains, and limiting childhood exposure to sugar instead of making it a dietary mainstay. No to eradicating birthday cake."

111,1524709077,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4886576-cody,4,"The Case Against Sugar proved to be a valuable yet alarming piece of evidence on not only western dietary habits, but the lack of important studies into a wide range of nutritional health. Obviously readers of this book will begin the first page with at least a rudimentary understanding of the negative effects of sugar on a persons health, but what Gary Taubes has done here has brought a greater light on the history of the consumption of sugar. Covering everything from the business of ""big sugar"" to the introduction of it into non-western nations in case studies to the critical and hypocritical public health studies conducted by a various nutritional academics. The case studies themselves proved to be fascinating (and horrifying). In particular the effect of sugar into populations of Native Americans in the Southwestern United States, or Kenya or the islands of Tokelau, where the introduction of sugar served as a sort of ""nutritional imperialism"" which affected such populations with concerned and immediate health effects. Also was the juxtaposition of ""Big Sugar"" and ""Big Tobacco,"" two economic systems that grew up together for profit over health ambitions. It's all quite interesting in historical and sociological terms. The one complaint with the book (and this is by no means the fault of Mr. Taubes) is there isn't any actual conclusive loaded gun evidence to completely eliminate sugar from our lives. There simply haven't been enough proper studies done on the subject with regards to fully understanding its implications on our diets. ""The research community can certainly do a much better job than it has in the past testing of all these questions. But we may have a very long wait before the public-health authorities fund such studies and give us the definitive answers we seek....I've argued here that enough evidence exists for us to consider sugar very likely to be a toxic substance, and to make an informed decision about how best to balance the likely risks with the benefits."" Taubes argues for as less sugar as possible and only then can we understand just how negatively it affected our health and nutrition. Rating 4.5/5"

Ugh!Let's start with the reading and recording of this book.... To say that it read like a text book would be saying it kindly... The reading was very dry and borderline boring. The material was extremely technical and required me to rewind repeatedly in order to refocus and relisten to what was being said. This is a heavy book - both with the depth and scope of knowledge in multiple disciplines including medical, health, socioeconomic, and food. So prepare yourselves for an in depth dive into the world of the human body and how it functions. I would have given this book a 5-star rating if it weren't so very dryly written; otherwise, what I learned has left me speechless. I would easily say that if you want to learn about sugar and how it impacts the human body then this is definitely the book to read or listen to. I learned more than I ever thought possible about what sugar does in the body and to the body. I must say that this book presents the facts very well with lots of historical and scientific evidence to back its points and arguments. I found the material well put together and presented. A large focus of the book was on Diabetes and its relationship with sugar and other ""Western"" Diseases. Since my husband was diagnosed with type 2 Diabetes a year ago, the information in this book was critical and relevant to my family's needs. I learned a lot of important information that I can utilize in our home to help my husband deal with, and hopefully beat, this disease. I highly recommend this book to everyone and anyone who wants to learn about a healthier live style of eating and living. This book is especially pertinent to everyone who is currently suffering from various diseases that are classified as a ""western"" disease such as diabetes, high blood pressure, pre-diabetes, and even cancer.... this book sheds light on a lot of issues that the general public seems to be in the dark about. Ignore the dryness of the writing and read the book for the content - I believe it's priceless information. Good Luck and Happy Reading!"

What's done is done. People emotionally respond to certain foods, and even if the food wreaks havoc on the body, we are all going to die sometime, so sugar must retain a place in the cultural consciousness, however limited. In conclusion: yes to avoiding sugar in everyday products, cutting out dessert, embracing whole grains, and limiting childhood exposure to sugar instead of making it a dietary mainstay.

141,1524709077,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4886576-cody,4,"The Case Against Sugar proved to be a valuable yet alarming piece of evidence on not only western dietary habits, but the lack of important studies into a wide range of nutritional health. Obviously readers of this book will begin the first page with at least a rudimentary understanding of the negative effects of sugar on a persons health, but what Gary Taubes has done here has brought a greater light on the history of the consumption of sugar. Covering everything from the business of ""big sugar"" to the introduction of it into non-western nations in case studies to the critical and hypocritical public health studies conducted by a various nutritional academics. The case studies themselves proved to be fascinating (and horrifying). In particular the effect of sugar into populations of Native Americans in the Southwestern United States, or Kenya or the islands of Tokelau, where the introduction of sugar served as a sort of ""nutritional imperialism"" which affected such populations with concerned and immediate health effects. Also was the juxtaposition of ""Big Sugar"" and ""Big Tobacco,"" two economic systems that grew up together for profit over health ambitions. It's all quite interesting in historical and sociological terms. The one complaint with the book (and this is by no means the fault of Mr. Taubes) is there isn't any actual conclusive loaded gun evidence to completely eliminate sugar from our lives. There simply haven't been enough proper studies done on the subject with regards to fully understanding its implications on our diets. ""The research community can certainly do a much better job than it has in the past testing of all these questions. But we may have a very long wait before the public-health authorities fund such studies and give us the definitive answers we seek....I've argued here that enough evidence exists for us to consider sugar very likely to be a toxic substance, and to make an informed decision about how best to balance the likely risks with the benefits."" Taubes argues for as less sugar as possible and only then can we understand just how negatively it affected our health and nutrition. Rating 4.5/5"
142,1524709077,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9057931-marianna,4,"Well..... after listening to this book, I think I may never touch sugar again..... Ugh!Let's start with the reading and recording of this book.... To say that it read like a text book would be saying it kindly... The reading was very dry and borderline boring. The material was extremely technical and required me to rewind repeatedly in order to refocus and relisten to what was being said. This is a heavy book - both with the depth and scope of knowledge in multiple disciplines including medical, health, socioeconomic, and food. So prepare yourselves for an in depth dive into the world of the human body and how it functions. I would have given this book a 5-star rating if it weren't so very dryly written; otherwise, what I learned has left me speechless. I would easily say that if you want to learn about sugar and how it impacts the human body then this is definitely the book to read or listen to. I learned more than I ever thought possible about what sugar does in the body and to the body. I must say that this book presents the facts very well with lots of historical and scientific evidence to back its points and arguments. I found the material well put together and presented. A large focus of the book was on Diabetes and its relationship with sugar and other ""Western"" Diseases. Since my husband was diagnosed with type 2 Diabetes a year ago, the information in this book was critical and relevant to my family's needs. I learned a lot of important information that I can utilize in our home to help my husband deal with, and hopefully beat, this disease. I highly recommend this book to everyone and anyone who wants to learn about a healthier live style of eating and living. This book is especially pertinent to everyone who is currently suffering from various diseases that are classified as a ""western"" disease such as diabetes, high blood pressure, pre-diabetes, and even cancer.... this book sheds light on a lot of issues that the general public seems to be in the dark about. Ignore the dryness of the writing and read the book for the content - I believe it's priceless information. Good Luck and Happy Reading!"
143,1524709077,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16197762-leanna-pohevitz,4,"Well, if this book doesn’t make you rethink your eating habits I’m not sure what might. It is probable that sugar leads to, disease susceptibility, Alzheimers, cancer, gout, diabetes, heart disease and obesity. I will attempt to change some things about my diet, for sure. I love how well researched this book was, all the studies he quotes and how he looks at the affect of a western diet on indigenous populations that adopted it (often because they were forced to). The evidence shows, there is a pretty strong case against sugar."
144,1524709077,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21346273-carrie,5,"This book was terrifying, in a good way (I think). It all seems so commonsense to me, but at the same time it truly is hard to avoid sugar altogether - after all, what is a Birthday without a cake? Lol. But finding out a balance with little to no sugar is worth it in the long run, as Gary Taubes has laid out all of the reasons to make the change in this book.I was very intrigued by the history of how the sugar industry has taken such advantage of the world. It is scary how money has made us so unhealthy, ill and caused far too many premature deaths via cancer and etc. This was a great read, and I feel that all humans should read it. It did take me about 3 weeks to read, (2 months if you count the breaks I took). It is a lot of information to understand, names to remember, and facts to digest. Gary Taubes' research shouldn't be brushed aside. It is a game changer and truly could save your life!"
145,1524709077,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40175257-christy,4,"Sugar has drastically changed the health of the human race. Or has it? This book gives many, many examples of groups of people throughout history who were introduced to sugar and what happened to their health. And also how it has become an ingredient in just about everything. The thing is though, that there is no way to prove that anything is actually caused by sugar, because it is usually paired with one or multiple other potentially harmful factors, hence the name of the book, The Case Against Sugar. You can't prove it, but he can argue his case. I liked this book and it will definitely make me try to consume less sugar. But as in everything, I think moderation is key. Especially when it is extremely difficult to avoid sugar (and I don't mean just treats, it's in lunch meat) in our culture. The book does drag on a bit, but it is filled with a lot of great information and ideas."
146,1524709077,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30261451-celia,4,"Sugar is dangerous and addictive!! It causes more chronic diseases tan you might think.It even contributes to the bad effects of smoking. Before tobacco was being soaked in sugar water to make it more easily inhalable, it was just chewed. Now smokers inhale and the result is possibly emphysema, bronchitis and lung cancer.And, if I understand the book correctly, sugar also causes:Hypertension - caused by sugar, not salt.Heart disease - caused by sugar because it changes the metabolism of triglycerides and fatty deposits can occur in arteries. Obesity - too many calories Diabetes - caused by obesityGout - caused by diabetesInsulin Resistance exacerbates diabetesSounds like I should eliminate sugar from my diet. Hope it's not too late."
147,1524709077,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13091714-anna,3,"Interesting and quite convincing information about the many serious diseases and disorders which are quite possibly caused by and are certainly exacerbated by consumption of sugar. The trouble with the book is that is is extremely repetitive. By the third of fourth chapter I was quickly growing bored by the details of his arguments because they seemed to be the same details as the argument made three or four times in the chapters previous. On the other hand the weight of evidence compiled makes a very good case and I will need to be even more vigilant in seeking to reduce sugar from my diet. Realistically I don't think I could ever entirely eliminate it as the author suggests would be best, at least not unless society in general makes that more possible."
148,1524709077,http://goodreads.com/user/show/895848-ventzi,5,"A definite must-read. The research is thorough and convincing, without the presentation being patronising or prescriptive.What I like best for myself is how this book gives me one more point of view to a number of events in the history of science, and so convinces me of the truthfulness of the relayed facts, as well as to ignore most of current main-stream nutrition advice, making my own conclusions and decisions instead.For me, the case against sugar is overwhelming. The sad and pitiful fact, however, is that there is no definite research being funded to figure out why and how exactly sugar may be in the roots of our bodies starting to malfunction in various ways."
149,1524709077,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3183576-cheri,5,"A real tour de force on the part of the author. The most fascinating part of this book is how we come to believe what we do about how things work, and how constant repetition of something can make it ""true."" (It's definitely a lesson for our times in many ways.) I have long doubted many things I learned in school (I'm a dietitian), but Taubes convinced me that sugar is probably even worse than I had thought. He is careful to make clear that there's so much we don't know, and may never know, but that doesn't mean there isn't a reasonable course of action. I do wish he would have discussed white wheat flour and its relation to refined sugar -- maybe his next book?"
150,1524709077,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31879056-peggy-haslar,4,"A total eye-opener. The first section on the history of sugar is simply devastating. Then, how government helped subsidize our addiction and change our tastes. Really valuable read."
151,1524709077,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13244359-donna,3,"A more accurate title for the first half would be ""The History of Sugar."" And a more accurate title for the last half would be ""Sugar is the Devil.""I enjoyed the first half of this. The historical details were fascinating. The author showed not just the history of sugar, but he also showed that when sugar became prevalent in many cultures across the the globe, disease soon followed. This part was a solid 4 stars for me.Then the last half kind of unraveled a bit. It jumped around a lot to different topics. There wasn't as much research and some of it seemed dated. I did page math a few times. Sugar is the villain here, along with the Sugar Association. But the fact that sugar isn't good for us isn't new information. Some new info/research would have been appreciated. Overall, I liked the history and the spin the author put on his platform. So 3 starsThis is my take on health books of this nature. There is always some platform. There is always an enemy. We are all going to die. Associations (like the Sugar Association, United Egg Association, the National Dairy Council, etc.,) are like teenagers when they speak.....YOU HAVE TO READ BETWEEN THE LINES. Of course they want to be looked upon in a rosy glow, but not all things that come from their direction is truth. They want you to buy what they are selling. Books of this nature are kind of the same...I feel I have to read between the lines. But I like the research and I like the spin they put on their platform. However, I need the research for it to worth my while. So 3 stars."

So prepare yourselves for an in depth dive into the world of the human body and how it functions.

I learned a lot of important information that I can utilize in our home to help my husband deal with, and hopefully beat, this disease. I highly recommend this book to everyone and anyone who wants to learn about a healthier live style of eating and living.

I love how well researched this book was, all the studies he quotes and how he looks at the affect of a western diet on indigenous populations that adopted it (often because they were forced to).

It all seems so commonsense to me, but at the same time it truly is hard to avoid sugar altogether - after all, what is a Birthday without a cake? Lol. But finding out a balance with little to no sugar is worth it in the long run, as Gary Taubes has laid out all of the reasons to make the change in this book.I was very intrigued by the history of how the sugar industry has taken such advantage of the world. It is scary how money has made us so unhealthy, ill and caused far too many premature deaths via cancer and etc. This was a great read, and I feel that all humans should read it. It did take me about 3 weeks to read, (2 months if you count the breaks I took). It is a lot of information to understand, names to remember, and facts to digest. Gary Taubes' research shouldn't be brushed aside. It is a game changer and truly could save your life!"
175,1524709077,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40175257-christy,4,"Sugar has drastically changed the health of the human race. Or has it? This book gives many, many examples of groups of people throughout history who were introduced to sugar and what happened to their health. And also how it has become an ingredient in just about everything. The thing is though, that there is no way to prove that anything is actually caused by sugar, because it is usually paired with one or multiple other potentially harmful factors, hence the name of the book, The Case Against Sugar. You can't prove it, but he can argue his case. I liked this book and it will definitely make me try to consume less sugar. But as in everything, I think moderation is key. Especially when it is extremely difficult to avoid sugar (and I don't mean just treats, it's in lunch meat) in our culture. The book does drag on a bit, but it is filled with a lot of great information and ideas."
176,1524709077,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30261451-celia,4,"Sugar is dangerous and addictive!! It causes more chronic diseases tan you might think.It even contributes to the bad effects of smoking. Before tobacco was being soaked in sugar water to make it more easily inhalable, it was just chewed. Now smokers inhale and the result is possibly emphysema, bronchitis and lung cancer.And, if I understand the book correctly, sugar also causes:Hypertension - caused by sugar, not salt.Heart disease - caused by sugar because it changes the metabolism of triglycerides and fatty deposits can occur in arteries. Obesity - too many calories Diabetes - caused by obesityGout - caused by diabetesInsulin Resistance exacerbates diabetesSounds like I should eliminate sugar from my diet. Hope it's not too late."
177,1524709077,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13091714-anna,3,"Interesting and quite convincing information about the many serious diseases and disorders which are quite possibly caused by and are certainly exacerbated by consumption of sugar. The trouble with the book is that is is extremely repetitive. By the third of fourth chapter I was quickly growing bored by the details of his arguments because they seemed to be the same details as the argument made three or four times in the chapters previous. On the other hand the weight of evidence compiled makes a very good case and I will need to be even more vigilant in seeking to reduce sugar from my diet. Realistically I don't think I could ever entirely eliminate it as the author suggests would be best, at least not unless society in general makes that more possible."
178,1524709077,http://goodreads.com/user/show/895848-ventzi,5,"A definite must-read. The research is thorough and convincing, without the presentation being patronising or prescriptive.What I like best for myself is how this book gives me one more point of view to a number of events in the history of science, and so convinces me of the truthfulness of the relayed facts, as well as to ignore most of current main-stream nutrition advice, making my own conclusions and decisions instead.For me, the case against sugar is overwhelming. The sad and pitiful fact, however, is that there is no definite research being funded to figure out why and how exactly sugar may be in the roots of our bodies starting to malfunction in various ways."
179,1524709077,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3183576-cheri,5,"A real tour de force on the part of the author. The most fascinating part of this book is how we come to believe what we do about how things work, and how constant repetition of something can make it ""true."" (It's definitely a lesson for our times in many ways.) I have long doubted many things I learned in school (I'm a dietitian), but Taubes convinced me that sugar is probably even worse than I had thought. He is careful to make clear that there's so much we don't know, and may never know, but that doesn't mean there isn't a reasonable course of action. I do wish he would have discussed white wheat flour and its relation to refined sugar -- maybe his next book?"
180,1524709077,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31879056-peggy-haslar,4,"A total eye-opener. The first section on the history of sugar is simply devastating. Then, how government helped subsidize our addiction and change our tastes. Really valuable read."
181,1524709077,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13244359-donna,3,"A more accurate title for the first half would be ""The History of Sugar."" And a more accurate title for the last half would be ""Sugar is the Devil.""I enjoyed the first half of this. The historical details were fascinating. The author showed not just the history of sugar, but he also showed that when sugar became prevalent in many cultures across the the globe, disease soon followed. This part was a solid 4 stars for me.Then the last half kind of unraveled a bit. It jumped around a lot to different topics. There wasn't as much research and some of it seemed dated. I did page math a few times. Sugar is the villain here, along with the Sugar Association. But the fact that sugar isn't good for us isn't new information. Some new info/research would have been appreciated. Overall, I liked the history and the spin the author put on his platform. So 3 starsThis is my take on health books of this nature. There is always some platform. There is always an enemy. We are all going to die. Associations (like the Sugar Association, United Egg Association, the National Dairy Council, etc.,) are like teenagers when they speak.....YOU HAVE TO READ BETWEEN THE LINES. Of course they want to be looked upon in a rosy glow, but not all things that come from their direction is truth. They want you to buy what they are selling. Books of this nature are kind of the same...I feel I have to read between the lines. But I like the research and I like the spin they put on their platform. However, I need the research for it to worth my while. So 3 stars."
182,1524709077,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1229150-kristina,2,"I'm going to be honest - this book was so boring. Plenty of times I felt like giving up but instead I just kept plugging along through it- halfway getting it and the other half ignoring it. If you don't read it let me tell you what it says- sugar isn't awesome, the sugar industry has manipulated things so it is now so prevalent that you can't get away from it - and pretty much all our health maladies would be cured if we stopped eating it. Also I ate jelly beans that I stored in my pocket on my way to work this morning. Gary Taubs would shame me for this - instead I laugh in the face of danger."
183,1524709077,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53450768-michael,4,"An excellent, very deeply researched book about the history of Sugar's rise to prominence as a food additive in the western diet, and as a public health crisis. It's very hard to feel good about eating 70% of the foods one might normally eat while listening to this book, I can't really speak on the books effect afterwards as it hasn't been long. It is eye-opening though just to come to terms with how sugar has affected me in so many different ways at pivotal moments in my life. Unfortunately it also brings to bear the same old story that underlines every industry's political past in the United States: conflict of interest. I'm starting to feel like I can't trust anything in this country as it has undoubtedly been so manipulated by duplicitous science, political manipulation, and downright lies, that there is no telling which way is what.That being said, Taubes is definitely totally against sugar, and proposes we eliminate it entirely from our diets, much as someone trying to quit smoking would have to eliminate the habit entirely instead of cutting down. This seems extreme to me, and for me personally very difficult, but I think he might just be right. "
184,1524709077,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9791216-sara,5,"This book will make you shout out loud in complete outrage -- like I often did years ago when I read Susan Faludi's ""Backlash."" For example, did you know the nutritionists at the cereal companies fought for years to keep sugared-cereals off the market because they knew how devastating they could be for kids? And did you know that cigarette smoking became popular and created the lung-smoking epidemic AFTER sugar-curing became popular? Soaking the tobacco leaves in sugar water before they were cured made the cigarettes taste better and made them more addictive. There's been a lot of news lately about how the sugar companies worked to keep nutritionists focused on fat being to blame for the rise in obesity and diabetes rates rather than sugar. Now we know that sugar consumption plays a major role in both. And it's harder and harder to avoid not only sugar, but all the multiple sugar substitutes, too, because it's in everything. Taubes explains all of this in a way that's easy to understand so you don't lose any of that continually building anger. "

It is a simple and compelling story, one that is so obviously basically true, that it drives me insane that people just can't see it.""All truth passes through three stages. First, it is ridiculed. Second, it is violently opposed. Third, it is accepted as being self-evident.""We are JUST coming out of the first stage. I just wonder how many will have to die before we get to stage three. :("

The emphasis on the addictive nature of sugar is key to our understanding its role in our lives.As a practicing physician I have had incredible success with my patients teaching them about the concepts in this book. I have had patients resolve all of the parameters of metabolic syndrome by eliminating sugar and sometimes both sugar and starch from their diet."
187,1524709077,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5-elizabeth,0,"I listened to this on audiobook. Coming from personal experience as well as from reading this book, I do think that sugar in large qualities is damaging our bodies and I'm concerned. It will be telling to see how our generation fares in the coming years regarding illnesses such as diabetes, arthritis, pancreatic issues and other systemic problems. It's shocking how much sugar is used as an additive to thicken things or just to amplify flavor. My doctor recommended giving it up entirely, which is extremely challenging to do. Sigh..."
188,1524709077,http://goodreads.com/user/show/301768-judith,3,"This is an extremely well-researched and thorough analysis of the case against sugar. The problem with this book is that it may be a little too intense for the average reader, or maybe I should say the book isn't dumbed down enough for the general American public. Having said that, there is a wealth of information here, including a history of the sugaring of tobacco which I had not previously known. To think smoking wasn't bad enough already, they had to add sugar to it. The author is preaching to the choir with me because I already believe that I am a sugar addict and the only way to control my sugar addiction is to stay away from it as much as possible. On the other hand, most of the people I know can handle sugar in moderation, so I'm not so sure it can be lumped in with other substances which are so harmful, like tobacco, alcohol, and other drugs. I do agree that the sugar industry has an incredible hold over the powers that be and that it is dangerous to the public health in general and that we all pay the price for the damage it does. "
189,1524709077,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13385989-lisa,2,"This book successfully does make a case against sugar, focusing on the history of the case. While I found the overall argument quite convincing, what I found lacking, surprisingly, was a definition of what sugar is. Taubes thoroughly explains that high-fructose corn syrup is quite similar to sucrose in composition (55% fructose as opposed to 50%), which was helpful. But I'm still confused about effects of sugar described throughout the book being attributed to glucose vs fructose, especially regarding glycemic index effects. Furthermore, the author sometimes discussed consumption of ""sweets,"" but I'd thought a reason sugar consumption has increased so drastically is its increased amounts in processed foods we don't typically consider sweet. The epilogue emphasizes that this is not a proscriptive book, but I found it so theoretical about such a practical topic that it didn't live up to its potential for me."
190,1524709077,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27285494-roberta,3,"In the beginning I was like ""Hell yeah, sugar is evil, tell them that, Gary!!!1!1!!"" and the first half of the book was truly interesting. But as it went on the examples and concepts that were described started to seem repetitive. Most notable ones were:*Sugar industry funds research to prove that sugar isn't bad for your health*Some scientists put blame on dietary fat*Indigenous communities get increasingly fatter and more sick as they adopt the Western diet*Sugar is fed to rats; rats get fat and die*Silly nutritionists say that ""a calorie is a calorie""I mean, I agree with Gary 100% and this book was nothing if not well researched, but MAAAAAAAAN it eventually got just too damn repetitive and what at first had to be 5 stars by the end dropped to 3."

It's very hard to feel good about eating 70% of the foods one might normally eat while listening to this book, I can't really speak on the books effect afterwards as it hasn't been long. It is eye-opening though just to come to terms with how sugar has affected me in so many different ways at pivotal moments in my life. Unfortunately it also brings to bear the same old story that underlines every industry's political past in the United States: conflict of interest. I'm starting to feel like I can't trust anything in this country as it has undoubtedly been so manipulated by duplicitous science, political manipulation, and downright lies, that there is no telling which way is what.That being said, Taubes is definitely totally against sugar, and proposes we eliminate it entirely from our diets, much as someone trying to quit smoking would have to eliminate the habit entirely instead of cutting down. This seems extreme to me, and for me personally very difficult, but I think he might just be right. "
214,1524709077,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9791216-sara,5,"This book will make you shout out loud in complete outrage -- like I often did years ago when I read Susan Faludi's ""Backlash."" For example, did you know the nutritionists at the cereal companies fought for years to keep sugared-cereals off the market because they knew how devastating they could be for kids? And did you know that cigarette smoking became popular and created the lung-smoking epidemic AFTER sugar-curing became popular? Soaking the tobacco leaves in sugar water before they were cured made the cigarettes taste better and made them more addictive. There's been a lot of news lately about how the sugar companies worked to keep nutritionists focused on fat being to blame for the rise in obesity and diabetes rates rather than sugar. Now we know that sugar consumption plays a major role in both. And it's harder and harder to avoid not only sugar, but all the multiple sugar substitutes, too, because it's in everything. Taubes explains all of this in a way that's easy to understand so you don't lose any of that continually building anger. "

It will be telling to see how our generation fares in the coming years regarding illnesses such as diabetes, arthritis, pancreatic issues and other systemic problems. It's shocking how much sugar is used as an additive to thicken things or just to amplify flavor. My doctor recommended giving it up entirely, which is extremely challenging to do. Sigh..."
218,1524709077,http://goodreads.com/user/show/301768-judith,3,"This is an extremely well-researched and thorough analysis of the case against sugar. The problem with this book is that it may be a little too intense for the average reader, or maybe I should say the book isn't dumbed down enough for the general American public. Having said that, there is a wealth of information here, including a history of the sugaring of tobacco which I had not previously known. To think smoking wasn't bad enough already, they had to add sugar to it. The author is preaching to the choir with me because I already believe that I am a sugar addict and the only way to control my sugar addiction is to stay away from it as much as possible. On the other hand, most of the people I know can handle sugar in moderation, so I'm not so sure it can be lumped in with other substances which are so harmful, like tobacco, alcohol, and other drugs. I do agree that the sugar industry has an incredible hold over the powers that be and that it is dangerous to the public health in general and that we all pay the price for the damage it does. "

While I found the overall argument quite convincing, what I found lacking, surprisingly, was a definition of what sugar is. Taubes thoroughly explains that high-fructose corn syrup is quite similar to sucrose in composition (55% fructose as opposed to 50%), which was helpful. But I'm still confused about effects of sugar described throughout the book being attributed to glucose vs fructose, especially regarding glycemic index effects. Furthermore, the author sometimes discussed consumption of ""sweets,"" but I'd thought a reason sugar consumption has increased so drastically is its increased amounts in processed foods we don't typically consider sweet. The epilogue emphasizes that this is not a proscriptive book, but I found it so theoretical about such a practical topic that it didn't live up to its potential for me."

It makes a fantastic case against sugar, which leads me to conclude, personally, that avoiding it is the best way to avoid metabolic syndrome (and as Taubes notes, the insulin resistance and high triglycerides that characterize metabolic syndrome are precursors to most common modern maladies).But while I wholeheartedly agree that the food industry has done us a terrible service by highly refining grains and pumping them, as well as various other (often supposedly savory) products with sugar and HFCS, I find the condemnation of birthday cake and so on unrealistic. What's done is done. People emotionally respond to certain foods, and even if the food wreaks havoc on the body, we are all going to die sometime, so sugar must retain a place in the cultural consciousness, however limited. In conclusion: yes to avoiding sugar in everyday products, cutting out dessert, embracing whole grains, and limiting childhood exposure to sugar instead of making it a dietary mainstay. No to eradicating birthday cake."

231,1524709077,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4886576-cody,4,"The Case Against Sugar proved to be a valuable yet alarming piece of evidence on not only western dietary habits, but the lack of important studies into a wide range of nutritional health. Obviously readers of this book will begin the first page with at least a rudimentary understanding of the negative effects of sugar on a persons health, but what Gary Taubes has done here has brought a greater light on the history of the consumption of sugar. Covering everything from the business of ""big sugar"" to the introduction of it into non-western nations in case studies to the critical and hypocritical public health studies conducted by a various nutritional academics. The case studies themselves proved to be fascinating (and horrifying). In particular the effect of sugar into populations of Native Americans in the Southwestern United States, or Kenya or the islands of Tokelau, where the introduction of sugar served as a sort of ""nutritional imperialism"" which affected such populations with concerned and immediate health effects. Also was the juxtaposition of ""Big Sugar"" and ""Big Tobacco,"" two economic systems that grew up together for profit over health ambitions. It's all quite interesting in historical and sociological terms. The one complaint with the book (and this is by no means the fault of Mr. Taubes) is there isn't any actual conclusive loaded gun evidence to completely eliminate sugar from our lives. There simply haven't been enough proper studies done on the subject with regards to fully understanding its implications on our diets. ""The research community can certainly do a much better job than it has in the past testing of all these questions. But we may have a very long wait before the public-health authorities fund such studies and give us the definitive answers we seek....I've argued here that enough evidence exists for us to consider sugar very likely to be a toxic substance, and to make an informed decision about how best to balance the likely risks with the benefits."" Taubes argues for as less sugar as possible and only then can we understand just how negatively it affected our health and nutrition. Rating 4.5/5"

Ugh!Let's start with the reading and recording of this book.... To say that it read like a text book would be saying it kindly... The reading was very dry and borderline boring. The material was extremely technical and required me to rewind repeatedly in order to refocus and relisten to what was being said. This is a heavy book - both with the depth and scope of knowledge in multiple disciplines including medical, health, socioeconomic, and food. So prepare yourselves for an in depth dive into the world of the human body and how it functions. I would have given this book a 5-star rating if it weren't so very dryly written; otherwise, what I learned has left me speechless. I would easily say that if you want to learn about sugar and how it impacts the human body then this is definitely the book to read or listen to. I learned more than I ever thought possible about what sugar does in the body and to the body. I must say that this book presents the facts very well with lots of historical and scientific evidence to back its points and arguments. I found the material well put together and presented. A large focus of the book was on Diabetes and its relationship with sugar and other ""Western"" Diseases. Since my husband was diagnosed with type 2 Diabetes a year ago, the information in this book was critical and relevant to my family's needs. I learned a lot of important information that I can utilize in our home to help my husband deal with, and hopefully beat, this disease. I highly recommend this book to everyone and anyone who wants to learn about a healthier live style of eating and living. This book is especially pertinent to everyone who is currently suffering from various diseases that are classified as a ""western"" disease such as diabetes, high blood pressure, pre-diabetes, and even cancer.... this book sheds light on a lot of issues that the general public seems to be in the dark about. Ignore the dryness of the writing and read the book for the content - I believe it's priceless information. Good Luck and Happy Reading!"

What's done is done. People emotionally respond to certain foods, and even if the food wreaks havoc on the body, we are all going to die sometime, so sugar must retain a place in the cultural consciousness, however limited. In conclusion: yes to avoiding sugar in everyday products, cutting out dessert, embracing whole grains, and limiting childhood exposure to sugar instead of making it a dietary mainstay.

261,1524709077,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4886576-cody,4,"The Case Against Sugar proved to be a valuable yet alarming piece of evidence on not only western dietary habits, but the lack of important studies into a wide range of nutritional health. Obviously readers of this book will begin the first page with at least a rudimentary understanding of the negative effects of sugar on a persons health, but what Gary Taubes has done here has brought a greater light on the history of the consumption of sugar. Covering everything from the business of ""big sugar"" to the introduction of it into non-western nations in case studies to the critical and hypocritical public health studies conducted by a various nutritional academics. The case studies themselves proved to be fascinating (and horrifying). In particular the effect of sugar into populations of Native Americans in the Southwestern United States, or Kenya or the islands of Tokelau, where the introduction of sugar served as a sort of ""nutritional imperialism"" which affected such populations with concerned and immediate health effects. Also was the juxtaposition of ""Big Sugar"" and ""Big Tobacco,"" two economic systems that grew up together for profit over health ambitions. It's all quite interesting in historical and sociological terms. The one complaint with the book (and this is by no means the fault of Mr. Taubes) is there isn't any actual conclusive loaded gun evidence to completely eliminate sugar from our lives. There simply haven't been enough proper studies done on the subject with regards to fully understanding its implications on our diets. ""The research community can certainly do a much better job than it has in the past testing of all these questions. But we may have a very long wait before the public-health authorities fund such studies and give us the definitive answers we seek....I've argued here that enough evidence exists for us to consider sugar very likely to be a toxic substance, and to make an informed decision about how best to balance the likely risks with the benefits."" Taubes argues for as less sugar as possible and only then can we understand just how negatively it affected our health and nutrition. Rating 4.5/5"
262,1524709077,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9057931-marianna,4,"Well..... after listening to this book, I think I may never touch sugar again..... Ugh!Let's start with the reading and recording of this book.... To say that it read like a text book would be saying it kindly... The reading was very dry and borderline boring. The material was extremely technical and required me to rewind repeatedly in order to refocus and relisten to what was being said. This is a heavy book - both with the depth and scope of knowledge in multiple disciplines including medical, health, socioeconomic, and food. So prepare yourselves for an in depth dive into the world of the human body and how it functions. I would have given this book a 5-star rating if it weren't so very dryly written; otherwise, what I learned has left me speechless. I would easily say that if you want to learn about sugar and how it impacts the human body then this is definitely the book to read or listen to. I learned more than I ever thought possible about what sugar does in the body and to the body. I must say that this book presents the facts very well with lots of historical and scientific evidence to back its points and arguments. I found the material well put together and presented. A large focus of the book was on Diabetes and its relationship with sugar and other ""Western"" Diseases. Since my husband was diagnosed with type 2 Diabetes a year ago, the information in this book was critical and relevant to my family's needs. I learned a lot of important information that I can utilize in our home to help my husband deal with, and hopefully beat, this disease. I highly recommend this book to everyone and anyone who wants to learn about a healthier live style of eating and living. This book is especially pertinent to everyone who is currently suffering from various diseases that are classified as a ""western"" disease such as diabetes, high blood pressure, pre-diabetes, and even cancer.... this book sheds light on a lot of issues that the general public seems to be in the dark about. Ignore the dryness of the writing and read the book for the content - I believe it's priceless information. Good Luck and Happy Reading!"
263,1524709077,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16197762-leanna-pohevitz,4,"Well, if this book doesn’t make you rethink your eating habits I’m not sure what might. It is probable that sugar leads to, disease susceptibility, Alzheimers, cancer, gout, diabetes, heart disease and obesity. I will attempt to change some things about my diet, for sure. I love how well researched this book was, all the studies he quotes and how he looks at the affect of a western diet on indigenous populations that adopted it (often because they were forced to). The evidence shows, there is a pretty strong case against sugar."
264,1524709077,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21346273-carrie,5,"This book was terrifying, in a good way (I think). It all seems so commonsense to me, but at the same time it truly is hard to avoid sugar altogether - after all, what is a Birthday without a cake? Lol. But finding out a balance with little to no sugar is worth it in the long run, as Gary Taubes has laid out all of the reasons to make the change in this book.I was very intrigued by the history of how the sugar industry has taken such advantage of the world. It is scary how money has made us so unhealthy, ill and caused far too many premature deaths via cancer and etc. This was a great read, and I feel that all humans should read it. It did take me about 3 weeks to read, (2 months if you count the breaks I took). It is a lot of information to understand, names to remember, and facts to digest. Gary Taubes' research shouldn't be brushed aside. It is a game changer and truly could save your life!"
265,1524709077,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40175257-christy,4,"Sugar has drastically changed the health of the human race. Or has it? This book gives many, many examples of groups of people throughout history who were introduced to sugar and what happened to their health. And also how it has become an ingredient in just about everything. The thing is though, that there is no way to prove that anything is actually caused by sugar, because it is usually paired with one or multiple other potentially harmful factors, hence the name of the book, The Case Against Sugar. You can't prove it, but he can argue his case. I liked this book and it will definitely make me try to consume less sugar. But as in everything, I think moderation is key. Especially when it is extremely difficult to avoid sugar (and I don't mean just treats, it's in lunch meat) in our culture. The book does drag on a bit, but it is filled with a lot of great information and ideas."
266,1524709077,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30261451-celia,4,"Sugar is dangerous and addictive!! It causes more chronic diseases tan you might think.It even contributes to the bad effects of smoking. Before tobacco was being soaked in sugar water to make it more easily inhalable, it was just chewed. Now smokers inhale and the result is possibly emphysema, bronchitis and lung cancer.And, if I understand the book correctly, sugar also causes:Hypertension - caused by sugar, not salt.Heart disease - caused by sugar because it changes the metabolism of triglycerides and fatty deposits can occur in arteries. Obesity - too many calories Diabetes - caused by obesityGout - caused by diabetesInsulin Resistance exacerbates diabetesSounds like I should eliminate sugar from my diet. Hope it's not too late."
267,1524709077,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13091714-anna,3,"Interesting and quite convincing information about the many serious diseases and disorders which are quite possibly caused by and are certainly exacerbated by consumption of sugar. The trouble with the book is that is is extremely repetitive. By the third of fourth chapter I was quickly growing bored by the details of his arguments because they seemed to be the same details as the argument made three or four times in the chapters previous. On the other hand the weight of evidence compiled makes a very good case and I will need to be even more vigilant in seeking to reduce sugar from my diet. Realistically I don't think I could ever entirely eliminate it as the author suggests would be best, at least not unless society in general makes that more possible."
268,1524709077,http://goodreads.com/user/show/895848-ventzi,5,"A definite must-read. The research is thorough and convincing, without the presentation being patronising or prescriptive.What I like best for myself is how this book gives me one more point of view to a number of events in the history of science, and so convinces me of the truthfulness of the relayed facts, as well as to ignore most of current main-stream nutrition advice, making my own conclusions and decisions instead.For me, the case against sugar is overwhelming. The sad and pitiful fact, however, is that there is no definite research being funded to figure out why and how exactly sugar may be in the roots of our bodies starting to malfunction in various ways."
269,1524709077,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3183576-cheri,5,"A real tour de force on the part of the author. The most fascinating part of this book is how we come to believe what we do about how things work, and how constant repetition of something can make it ""true."" (It's definitely a lesson for our times in many ways.) I have long doubted many things I learned in school (I'm a dietitian), but Taubes convinced me that sugar is probably even worse than I had thought. He is careful to make clear that there's so much we don't know, and may never know, but that doesn't mean there isn't a reasonable course of action. I do wish he would have discussed white wheat flour and its relation to refined sugar -- maybe his next book?"
270,1524709077,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31879056-peggy-haslar,4,"A total eye-opener. The first section on the history of sugar is simply devastating. Then, how government helped subsidize our addiction and change our tastes. Really valuable read."
271,1524709077,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13244359-donna,3,"A more accurate title for the first half would be ""The History of Sugar."" And a more accurate title for the last half would be ""Sugar is the Devil.""I enjoyed the first half of this. The historical details were fascinating. The author showed not just the history of sugar, but he also showed that when sugar became prevalent in many cultures across the the globe, disease soon followed. This part was a solid 4 stars for me.Then the last half kind of unraveled a bit. It jumped around a lot to different topics. There wasn't as much research and some of it seemed dated. I did page math a few times. Sugar is the villain here, along with the Sugar Association. But the fact that sugar isn't good for us isn't new information. Some new info/research would have been appreciated. Overall, I liked the history and the spin the author put on his platform. So 3 starsThis is my take on health books of this nature. There is always some platform. There is always an enemy. We are all going to die. Associations (like the Sugar Association, United Egg Association, the National Dairy Council, etc.,) are like teenagers when they speak.....YOU HAVE TO READ BETWEEN THE LINES. Of course they want to be looked upon in a rosy glow, but not all things that come from their direction is truth. They want you to buy what they are selling. Books of this nature are kind of the same...I feel I have to read between the lines. But I like the research and I like the spin they put on their platform. However, I need the research for it to worth my while. So 3 stars."

Plenty of times I felt like giving up but instead I just kept plugging along through it- halfway getting it and the other half ignoring it.

I find his argument compelling, and it kind of makes me want to be a food hermit & never eat sugar again. Kind of."
284,1524709077,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3970974-helen,4,"This is a book which thoroughly explains the history of sugar in the world, plus the research done on sugar (and other foods) to see its effects on the human body. It explains well why we get such contradictory information from research on the body!"
285,1524709077,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3028316-inez,1,Wouldn't recommend as animal experiments are continually quoted. The author admits we don't react the same as animals - so why quote them; It's pseudo-science.
286,1524709077,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33739058-emily,4,"Pretty compelling scientific read-- I blew through it, and I drag through most books. It makes a fantastic case against sugar, which leads me to conclude, personally, that avoiding it is the best way to avoid metabolic syndrome (and as Taubes notes, the insulin resistance and high triglycerides that characterize metabolic syndrome are precursors to most common modern maladies).But while I wholeheartedly agree that the food industry has done us a terrible service by highly refining grains and pumping them, as well as various other (often supposedly savory) products with sugar and HFCS, I find the condemnation of birthday cake and so on unrealistic. What's done is done. People emotionally respond to certain foods, and even if the food wreaks havoc on the body, we are all going to die sometime, so sugar must retain a place in the cultural consciousness, however limited. In conclusion: yes to avoiding sugar in everyday products, cutting out dessert, embracing whole grains, and limiting childhood exposure to sugar instead of making it a dietary mainstay. No to eradicating birthday cake."

290,1524709077,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7487619-rachel-theshadesoforange,4,4.0 Stars   A dense but informative nutrition book that was easier to digest as an audiobook.
291,1524709077,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4886576-cody,4,"The Case Against Sugar proved to be a valuable yet alarming piece of evidence on not only western dietary habits, but the lack of important studies into a wide range of nutritional health. Obviously readers of this book will begin the first page with at least a rudimentary understanding of the negative effects of sugar on a persons health, but what Gary Taubes has done here has brought a greater light on the history of the consumption of sugar. Covering everything from the business of ""big sugar"" to the introduction of it into non-western nations in case studies to the critical and hypocritical public health studies conducted by a various nutritional academics. The case studies themselves proved to be fascinating (and horrifying). In particular the effect of sugar into populations of Native Americans in the Southwestern United States, or Kenya or the islands of Tokelau, where the introduction of sugar served as a sort of ""nutritional imperialism"" which affected such populations with concerned and immediate health effects. Also was the juxtaposition of ""Big Sugar"" and ""Big Tobacco,"" two economic systems that grew up together for profit over health ambitions. It's all quite interesting in historical and sociological terms. The one complaint with the book (and this is by no means the fault of Mr. Taubes) is there isn't any actual conclusive loaded gun evidence to completely eliminate sugar from our lives. There simply haven't been enough proper studies done on the subject with regards to fully understanding its implications on our diets. ""The research community can certainly do a much better job than it has in the past testing of all these questions. But we may have a very long wait before the public-health authorities fund such studies and give us the definitive answers we seek....I've argued here that enough evidence exists for us to consider sugar very likely to be a toxic substance, and to make an informed decision about how best to balance the likely risks with the benefits."" Taubes argues for as less sugar as possible and only then can we understand just how negatively it affected our health and nutrition. Rating 4.5/5"
292,1524709077,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9057931-marianna,4,"Well..... after listening to this book, I think I may never touch sugar again..... Ugh!Let's start with the reading and recording of this book.... To say that it read like a text book would be saying it kindly... The reading was very dry and borderline boring. The material was extremely technical and required me to rewind repeatedly in order to refocus and relisten to what was being said. This is a heavy book - both with the depth and scope of knowledge in multiple disciplines including medical, health, socioeconomic, and food. So prepare yourselves for an in depth dive into the world of the human body and how it functions. I would have given this book a 5-star rating if it weren't so very dryly written; otherwise, what I learned has left me speechless. I would easily say that if you want to learn about sugar and how it impacts the human body then this is definitely the book to read or listen to. I learned more than I ever thought possible about what sugar does in the body and to the body. I must say that this book presents the facts very well with lots of historical and scientific evidence to back its points and arguments. I found the material well put together and presented. A large focus of the book was on Diabetes and its relationship with sugar and other ""Western"" Diseases. Since my husband was diagnosed with type 2 Diabetes a year ago, the information in this book was critical and relevant to my family's needs. I learned a lot of important information that I can utilize in our home to help my husband deal with, and hopefully beat, this disease. I highly recommend this book to everyone and anyone who wants to learn about a healthier live style of eating and living. This book is especially pertinent to everyone who is currently suffering from various diseases that are classified as a ""western"" disease such as diabetes, high blood pressure, pre-diabetes, and even cancer.... this book sheds light on a lot of issues that the general public seems to be in the dark about. Ignore the dryness of the writing and read the book for the content - I believe it's priceless information. Good Luck and Happy Reading!"
293,1524709077,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16197762-leanna-pohevitz,4,"Well, if this book doesn’t make you rethink your eating habits I’m not sure what might. It is probable that sugar leads to, disease susceptibility, Alzheimers, cancer, gout, diabetes, heart disease and obesity. I will attempt to change some things about my diet, for sure. I love how well researched this book was, all the studies he quotes and how he looks at the affect of a western diet on indigenous populations that adopted it (often because they were forced to). The evidence shows, there is a pretty strong case against sugar."
294,1524709077,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21346273-carrie,5,"This book was terrifying, in a good way (I think). It all seems so commonsense to me, but at the same time it truly is hard to avoid sugar altogether - after all, what is a Birthday without a cake? Lol. But finding out a balance with little to no sugar is worth it in the long run, as Gary Taubes has laid out all of the reasons to make the change in this book.I was very intrigued by the history of how the sugar industry has taken such advantage of the world. It is scary how money has made us so unhealthy, ill and caused far too many premature deaths via cancer and etc. This was a great read, and I feel that all humans should read it. It did take me about 3 weeks to read, (2 months if you count the breaks I took). It is a lot of information to understand, names to remember, and facts to digest. Gary Taubes' research shouldn't be brushed aside. It is a game changer and truly could save your life!"
295,1524709077,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40175257-christy,4,"Sugar has drastically changed the health of the human race. Or has it? This book gives many, many examples of groups of people throughout history who were introduced to sugar and what happened to their health. And also how it has become an ingredient in just about everything. The thing is though, that there is no way to prove that anything is actually caused by sugar, because it is usually paired with one or multiple other potentially harmful factors, hence the name of the book, The Case Against Sugar. You can't prove it, but he can argue his case. I liked this book and it will definitely make me try to consume less sugar. But as in everything, I think moderation is key. Especially when it is extremely difficult to avoid sugar (and I don't mean just treats, it's in lunch meat) in our culture. The book does drag on a bit, but it is filled with a lot of great information and ideas."
296,1524709077,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30261451-celia,4,"Sugar is dangerous and addictive!! It causes more chronic diseases tan you might think.It even contributes to the bad effects of smoking. Before tobacco was being soaked in sugar water to make it more easily inhalable, it was just chewed. Now smokers inhale and the result is possibly emphysema, bronchitis and lung cancer.And, if I understand the book correctly, sugar also causes:Hypertension - caused by sugar, not salt.Heart disease - caused by sugar because it changes the metabolism of triglycerides and fatty deposits can occur in arteries. Obesity - too many calories Diabetes - caused by obesityGout - caused by diabetesInsulin Resistance exacerbates diabetesSounds like I should eliminate sugar from my diet. Hope it's not too late."
297,1524709077,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13091714-anna,3,"Interesting and quite convincing information about the many serious diseases and disorders which are quite possibly caused by and are certainly exacerbated by consumption of sugar. The trouble with the book is that is is extremely repetitive. By the third of fourth chapter I was quickly growing bored by the details of his arguments because they seemed to be the same details as the argument made three or four times in the chapters previous. On the other hand the weight of evidence compiled makes a very good case and I will need to be even more vigilant in seeking to reduce sugar from my diet. Realistically I don't think I could ever entirely eliminate it as the author suggests would be best, at least not unless society in general makes that more possible."
298,1524709077,http://goodreads.com/user/show/895848-ventzi,5,"A definite must-read. The research is thorough and convincing, without the presentation being patronising or prescriptive.What I like best for myself is how this book gives me one more point of view to a number of events in the history of science, and so convinces me of the truthfulness of the relayed facts, as well as to ignore most of current main-stream nutrition advice, making my own conclusions and decisions instead.For me, the case against sugar is overwhelming. The sad and pitiful fact, however, is that there is no definite research being funded to figure out why and how exactly sugar may be in the roots of our bodies starting to malfunction in various ways."
299,1524709077,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3183576-cheri,5,"A real tour de force on the part of the author. The most fascinating part of this book is how we come to believe what we do about how things work, and how constant repetition of something can make it ""true."" (It's definitely a lesson for our times in many ways.) I have long doubted many things I learned in school (I'm a dietitian), but Taubes convinced me that sugar is probably even worse than I had thought. He is careful to make clear that there's so much we don't know, and may never know, but that doesn't mean there isn't a reasonable course of action. I do wish he would have discussed white wheat flour and its relation to refined sugar -- maybe his next book?"
