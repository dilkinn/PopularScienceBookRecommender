I studied Kinesiology and nutrition at UC Berkeley. I ‘knew’ about trans fat and the value of Omega 3’s .... years before most people knew the word. When I put my flax seeds into a grinder to sprinkle them on my salads or other foods just before eating - in the 1970’s, people called me a hippie. I was far from one. Today....its not odd, but collectively if we live in the West....surrounded by temptations of The American ways of eating ....socially - emotionally - and spiritually- we each can benefit to check in within ourselves from time to time.....and ask ourselves.....”how are we doing with our eating”? Our need for education and improvements are endless. Ever notice how each one of us are on own eating path today. Eating in our society is a complicated issue. BUT *sugar* .....the empty calorie ....( no matter how much we like it - which I admit has been my #1 drug of choice my entire life -the drug I’ve had emotional and PHYSICAL battles with) ....is AS ADDICTING- more so - for some people - than cocaine- alcohol- or any other drug on the market. People who know they are sugar addicted - seriously addicted - know who they are. Many can’t eat a drop of the white sugar crystals without real fear of setting themselves up for cravings sooo strong for more....it’s all they can think about. MEAT - and VEGETABLES never cause THAT type of neurotic thinking. SUGAR can do that! There are also MANY GREAT BOOKS on the market which support - educate - and guide people to make healthy choices: So, if it’s support for healthy eating - cook books or guide books - I can share a few that I believe are excellent...BUT THIS BOOK... “The Case Against Sugar”.....probably the best book of its kind ... is The MOST researched. (its not a recipe book), Instead it is ....THE MOST historical book today that we have on the subject of sugar - scientifically proven - real evidence -that SUGAR is THE MAJOR NUMBER ONE DANGEROUS FOOD contributing to a wide range of diseases. Here are just a ‘few’ of those OTHER BOOKS that I own and highly endorse.( remember I studied nutrition and was certified as a nutritional consultant many years ago) - so my library is large.A few of my favorite books: “Clean Eating” by Alejandro Junger,MD, “The Total Health Cookbook” by Joseph Mercola, MD, The Blood Sugar Solution”, by Mark Hyman MD, Joseph Mercola “The No-Grain” diet, “The 21 Day Sugar Detox” is NOT my favorite because I don’t think people know how to use it right. —-ANYTHING that says 21 days ... can be a set up for a failure. But the recipes are fine. I personally - in general - don’t like that old American way of thinking ‘quick fix’.... The title alone feeds into account‘diet’ way of thinking. But with awareness. .... the book ‘might’ work for some people. Often - it’s a set up for the brain to want to be rewarded in 21 Days —- but then that same brain will punish oneself six months later. —- Personally I’m just careful with anything that ‘looks’ or sounds like a diet. Other books I own and like are by: Gary Null’s MD, Pam PeekeMD , Gabriel Cousens MD, GARY TAUBES.MOVING ONTO THIS BOOK.... There are some already excellent reviews. Cliff, your review is outstanding! Thank you! Gary Taubs is highly respected — his work is well researched. He has done a great service in explaining how SUGAR - TABLE SUGAR and high fructose corn syrup in particular have been a major contributor to a host of illnesses in Western society. This book covers the history - OF THE SUGAR INDUSTRY —including its ties to big businesses- our government-and the tobacco industry. Anyone with type 2 diabetes or concerns about getting it .... might seriously read this book. The hardest thing to digest for me - in reading this book.....even though I believe there is a need for a complete change in thinking ---is completely changing the way we celebrate with our SWEET TREATS.....Perhaps one day .... we will no longer celebrate a child’s birthday with cake or ice cream. Perhaps we really don’t need to express our love to each other with a sweetie for our sweetie on Valentines. Maybe the Easter Bunny will deliver real eggs...and perhaps Santa Claus is fat enough and doesn’t need any more cookies. How do we collectively support healthy changes? Little steps at a time .....“THE CASE AGAINST SUGAR”..... could be a terrific non-fiction book club pick so that communication can take place about an issue that affects all us. SUGAR is THAT powerful in our every day lives.....but it’s not an innocent bystander."
1,1524709077,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6011032-michelle-burton,5,"Gary Taubes has done an excellent job in explaining why sugar is so terrible for the body. I am seeing a nutritionist to help me with my weight and on my last visit she stated to me that you can eat any food in moderation. My response to her was, ""What does moderation mean? I guess a person could smoke crack in moderation but no one recommends that."" Taubes stated it clearly in his book that the people who say ""eat in moderation"" typically don't have a weight problem, (and my nutritionist does not) therefore what moderation looks like to one person would look totally different to another. For me, I am staying away from as much sugar as possible. It is in so much foods I don't know if I can totally abstain from it, but I can stop eating the main culprit of sugar delivery systems: candies, cookies, cakes, pop, fruit juices. Y'all, the stuff is deadly and toxic. My father lost a foot to diabetes and another family member kidneys recently failed due to diabetes and high blood pressure. Just like his book Good Calories, Bad Calories convinced me not to eat so much refine carbohydrates, The Case Against Sugar has convinced me to go cold turkey with sugar. Highly recommend all three of his books on nutrition if you want to be in the best health possible."
2,1524709077,http://goodreads.com/user/show/793473-clif-hostetler,5,"This book delves into Western civilization's history with sugar and its increasing rate of consumption since introduction of refined sugar into the Western diet. With this increased consumption also came the economic power of the sugar industry that throughout most of the twentieth century was the funder of nutritional research that tended to focus of causes for Western diseases in directions other that sugar itself.The rate of occurrence of diabetes, heart disease, gout, and a host of other chronic conditions pretty much parallels the rate of increase of sugar consumption. Throughout the twentieth century researchers seemed to want to blame saturated fats and cholesterol but had difficultly establishing links through subsequent health studies. Reluctance to distinguish between complex carbohydrates and simple sugar carbohydrate and refusing to accept the possibility of different metabolism routes for sucrose, fructose and other sugars made nutritional researchers blind to the possible role of sugar.In the manner of a good prosecuting attorney, Taubes in this book lays on layer after layer of additional evidence in making his case against sugar. This data is gleaned from medical history and multiple population studies of the relationship between the consumption of sugar with diabetes and then with all the other medical problems associated with diabetes. Today the American rate of diabetes is nearly one in ten adults, and approximately one in ten children are estimated to have nonalcoholic fatty liver disease which is a precursor of diabetes.I found particularly alarming the concept of ""perinatal metabolic programming"" (a.k.a. metabolic imprinting) as a hypothetical means by which succeeding generations may be more likely to develop diabetes, insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome than is true for today's population.The conditions in the womb—in the intrauterine environment—influence the development of the fetus, so that subtly different conditions will lead, in effect to the birth of newborns who respond differently to the environment they face outside the womb. In particular, the nutrients that the developing child receives in the womb—including the supply of glucose—pass across the placenta in proportion to the nutrient concentration in the mother's circulation. The higher the mother's blood sugar, the greater the supply of glucose to the fetus. The developing pancreas responds by overproducing insulin-secreting cells. ""The baby is not diabetic,"" says Roy Metzger, who studies diabetes and pregnancy at Northwestern University, ""but the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas are stimulated to function and grow in size and number by the environment they're in. So they start over-functioning. That in turn leads to a baby laying down more fat, which is why the baby of diabetic mother is typified by being a fat baby.""I interpreted the above as probably leading to increased sensitivity to the detrimental effects of sugar. However, Taubes elsewhere says it may increase or decrease sensitivity, he's not sure which.I thought once Taubes had established the link between sugar and diabetes that he would be finished. But he proceeds to link heart disease to diabetes through the indirect link of insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome that leads to hypertension. He didn't stop there. He then proceeded to name sugar as the culprit in ALL Western diseases.... if sugar causes insulin resistance and elevates triglycerides and makes us fat, then it very likely causes hypertension, too—if not directly, then at least indirectly, through its effect on insulin resistance and weight. Sugar is the culprit.So here's the if/then hypothesis: If these Western diseases are associated with obesity, diabetes, insulin resistance, and metabolic syndrome, which many of them are, then whatever causes insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome is likely to be the necessary dietary trigger for the diseases, or at least a key player in the causal pathway. Because there is significant reason to believe that sugars—sucrose and high-fructose corn syrup in particular, the nearly fifty-fifty combinations of glucose and fructose—are the dietary trigger of insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome, it's quite likely they are a primary cause of all these Western diseases, including ... cancer and Alzheimer's disease. Without these sugars in the diet, these chronic diseases would be relatively rare, if not, in some cases, virtually nonexistent.At this point Taubes proceeds to address the major Western diseases, one by one, to discuss the likelihood that sugar is responsible, or at least largely responsible. He proceeds to go into a detailed discussion of the hypothetical biochemical mechanisms by which ingestion of sugar can be linked to gout, hypertension, cancer and Alzheimer's disease. Taubes doesn't claim definitive proof according to the rules of science, and indeed it may never be possible to establish absolute proof. But Taubes has certainly laid out a string of circumstantial evidence and mechanisms by which simple sugars can lead to the Western diseases that I find compelling.Taube concludes with a discussion of what is the safe amount of sugar to eat. He says the answer is similar to the answer for tobacco. There is no safe amount for everyone. There are some population studies that have shown that when primitive cultures begin to eat the Western diet that problems begin to appear at about seventy pounds per capita per year of sugar consumption with a twenty year delay in the appearance of symptoms. The FDA in 1986 said forty-two pounds per capita per year was safe. (Current average per capita sugar consumption in USA is over 100 lb/year less losses from discarded food.) But that is a generalized amount for the total population and doesn't account for some individuals who may be maladapted to sugar. Furthermore, future populations may be more (or less) sensitive to sugar than in the past because of perinatal metabolic programming.Here's a link to an article about sugar addiction and withdrawal:https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2017/0...Here's a link to an NPR article titled, ""What The Industry Knew About Sugar's Health Effects, But Didn't Tell Us.""https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/...Here's a link to a NYT article about research on the negative health effects of sugar. One study, from Emory University, found that regular consumption not only of drinks containing added sugars but also of naturally sweet fruit juice raised the risk of an early death by as much as 44 percent. ""...risk for developing heart disease and kidney stones rose in direct proportion to the amount of high-fructose corn syrup they consumed.""https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/22/we..."
3,1524709077,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23080450-emily-crow,3,"Guess what? Sugar is not a healthy food. Who knew? In fact, according to Gary Taubes, it causes just about every ""disease of Western civilization"" and we probably shouldn't eat it at all, which kind of reminded me of all the other nutrition doomsday books I've read over the years:The China Study...don't eat meat or dairy, you will get sick and dieWheat Belly...don't eat wheat, you will get sick and dieEat More, Weigh Less...don't eat fat, you will get sick and dieThe Paleo Solution or any other paleo book...don't eat grains or beans, you will get sick and dieSugar Blues...oh wait, that was sugar again. Two strikes against sugar.So I guess I need to hole up in my nutrition bunker with nothing but vegetables and salad greens, and wait out the food apocalypse, because there's nothing left to eat! But, in all seriousness, I think any reasonable person can concede that sugar--at least in the ginormous amounts it is consumed in our society--is pretty much bad for us. As to just how bad, Gary Taubes is here to explain, and I found a lot that was interesting or valuable in this book. I've read about sugar and metabolic syndrome (potentially leading to type II diabetes, heart disease and other things) before, but Taubes described the process convincingly, and I ran across a couple of new things, like the potential link between high sugar consumption and gout. I also enjoyed the first few chapters about the history of the sugar industry.The second half of the book was not as satisfying for me, though. For one thing, Taubes returned to a couple of his key issues that I've always been a bit skeptical of, such as a complete dismissal of the ""calories in/calories out"" equation for weight loss. I get that it is not quite that simple--a lot of things can go wonky with the metabolism, and the types of foods eaten do make a difference--but at a certain level, yes, if you eat less and/or exercise more, you WILL lose weight, and we all know people who have done that. And then there's the Ancel Keys bashing.... I get it, Taubes thinks Keys was completely wrong with his Seven Countries Study and theory of saturated fat causing heart disease, but honestly, his rancor towards the man comes across like a personal grudge match at times. Especially since I actually do respect Keys' contributions and as far as I'm concerned, the saturated fat versus sugar issue hasn't been resolved yet. Regardless, the Mediterranean diet that Keys ended up espousing is NOT high in sugar and, as far as population studies goes, appears to be quite healthful.Now maybe you are thinking that population studies are of limited use and that Keys cherry-picked the Seven Countries Study to prove his point, and you would be right. Which leads me to my main issue with this book, and why I couldn't give it higher than a three star rating--in the last couple of chapters, Taubes shamelessly cherry-picks population studies to prove his extreme anti-sugar point, focusing on tribal peoples such as the Pima Indians and certain Pacific Islanders. Much closer to home (and much closer to the DNA mix of most of his audience, I'm guessing), I could point out other, conflicting populations, such as the Amish, who eat a lot of sugar (and refined flour) and don't have anywhere near the levels of heart disease and diabetes as the rest of us....Another missed opportunity is that, while Taubes discusses the economics and politics of sugar in the past (even the recent past), he doesn't address the political landscape that has created our current sugar glut. I've lived three places where sugar crops are a major part of the local economy: Hawaii (sugar cane), central Michigan (sugar beets) and currently central Illinois (corn, a.k.a. high fructose corn syrup). I am surrounded by field upon field upon field of mono-crops of genetically modified, pesticide-laden corn, much of it bound for factories to be turned into HFCS and then splattered on just about every processed food in the market at cut-rate prices, so that junk foods are cheaper than fresh vegetables. Because of government farm subsidies. And then the taxpayers are socked again at the end of the cycle, paying for all the health care. But if we all stopped eating this crap, I don't even want to imagine the economic repercussions. It's a messed up system, and it's entirely relevant to the issue of why so many North Americans are sick and obese, and it's barely addressed in this book. Finally, towards the end of the book, the speculation and scare-mongering about sugar reached an almost ridiculous level. Implying that allowing a child to have a single scoop of ice cream per week would be unhealthy? Wondering if we have messed up our health for generations to come by eating sugar? At this point, I just stopped taking the author seriously.But I will admit, at one point he states that the people who say sugar is OK in moderation are the people who don't have a problem with it, and I guess I just proved his point. Despite my many dietary vices, I don't have much of a sweet tooth, and can enjoy a bit of dark chocolate or a creme brulee once in a while. Sugar isn't addictive for me, and I actually find the sweetness of many processed foods kind of off putting. So I guess I would say, if you feel ""hooked"" on sugar, then definitely read this book. Otherwise, it has a few interesting points but ultimately seems a bit overwrought to me."
4,1524709077,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5922426-bam-cooks-the-books--,4,"Having been on a zero-sugar diet for the past three weeks and planning to make it a lifestyle change (see my review of Zero Sugar Diet: The 14-Day Plan to Flatten Your Belly, Crush Cravings, and Help Keep You Lean for Life), I wanted to read a bit more about the science behind the claim that the added sugars in processed foods could possibly be the cause of the current obesity and diabetes epidemic. Intuition, common sense and observation tells one it is true but so many diet fads have come and gone, that a little healthy skepticism is warranted. This book does not provide proof but does give more food for thought (pun intended.) There are very few studies to back up any of this as the big clinical trial money has been focused on shoring up the theory that dietary fat is the main culprit so a leap of faith is still required, I'm afraid, but I have to feel we're on the right track with wholesome, more natural food. Sometimes the simple answer IS the correct one. ""Diet advice that recommends we eat whole foods and avoid processed foods (foodlike substances) remove virtually all refined sugar by definition; diet advice to avoid sugar means, by definition, that we avoid virtually all processed foods."""

6,1524709077,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9888786-ita,5,"‘Medicine is mostly taught untethered from its history,’ asserts Gary Taubes at the beginning of this book. ‘Students are taught what to believe, but not always the evidence on which their beliefs are based.’This book is a much needed history of sugar. I can think of nowhere else where failure to look at the evidence on which medical beliefs are based has had, and continues to have, such tragic consequences.The leading authority who dominated the teaching about diabetes during the twentieth and into the twenty-first century was a dedicated doctor called Elliott Joslin. His textbook, ‘The Treatment of Diabetes Mellitus was first published in 1916. Revered as a bible, its most recent edition appeared in 2005, forty-three years after his death. Joslin argued that fats, and not sugar, were the cause of diabetes. This belief was supported by Harold Himsworth, a very influential diabetes researcher based in London, who in 1931 proposed that a diet rich in carbohydrate should be recommended to diabetics. Both Joslin and Himsworth pointed to Japan as a country where the diet was rich in carbohydrate and low in fat, and where there was very little diabetes. What both men ignored was that sugar consumption in Japan at that time was comparable to that in England and America in the nineteenth century, when diabetes was very rare. They both assumed that sugar and other carbohydrates were equivalent in their effects on the human body.Sugar (sucrose) is formed in plants by the condensation of two simpler sugars – glucose and fructose. Glucose, the molecule into which starches are digested, is used to provide energy. Any surplus is converted, in the liver and muscles, to glycogen (‘animal starch’) for storage until needed. Conversion of glucose to glycogen is under the control of the hormone insulin. Fructose, by contrast, is converted by the liver into fat. Its fat-forming effects seem to be enhanced when glucose is present.Joslin’s and Himsworth’s misconception might have been challenged by the research on metabolism, endocrinology, genetics and nutrition which was taking place in Germany and Austria before the Second World War. Post 1939 this very valuable work was lost to the scientific community. Nutritionists in the English-speaking world focussed on energy balance. A calorie was a calorie no matter where it came from. Putting on weight was simply a matter of consuming more calories than could be expended. Excess weight caused both diabetes and obesity. Diet and exercise were the solutions.When the technique of radioimmunoassay was developed in the 1960s, it brought with it the possibility of measuring hormone levels, and the problem of insulin resistance came to light. Unexpectedly, high insulin levels could accompany high levels of sugar in the blood. Insulin was no longer effective in moving glucose out of the blood and into cells. This pattern was found in people suffering from obesity, and in those who developed diabetes later in life. What caused insulin resistance was then a mystery. It has since been linked to sugar consumption.By the 1950s it was recognised that heart disease was associated with both diabetes and obesity. Whether too much fat or too much sugar caused heart disease was still an open question, and researchers were highly motivated to find an answer. The hypothesis that fat was the murder weapon was supported by the very wealthy and powerful Sugar Association with its Food and Nutrition Advisory Committee. The American Heart Association also came down on the side of fat. It advocated low fat diets for every American, while its researchers were admitting that the dietary fat/heart disease hypothesis needed much more investigation. Those who favoured the sugar hypothesis like John Yudkin in England faced ridicule and the charge of being quacks. In the 1960s Yudkin fed human subjects sugar-rich diets and reported that this increased their cholesterol and triglyceride levels. It seemed to ratchet up their insulin levels and even make their blood platelets sticky.Clinical trials were set up in the US and in Europe to test the fat, but not the sugar hypothesis. To date they have failed to show that high levels of dietary fat cause heart disease, obesity or diabetes. Nevertheless, in 1986 the American government and health organisations committed themselves to getting Americans to eat a low fat diet. Everyone else followed suit. The epidemic of diseases included in metabolic syndrome has only worsened.Gary Taubes cannot prove that sugar is the cause of Western chronic diseases, but the evidence he gives is overwhelming. I have concentrated on some of the scientific aspects, but this book contains much more. It is also as riveting as a good novel. Taubes’ clarity of vision is very rare, and a book like this is worth its weight in gold. "
7,1524709077,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8247780-cres,1,"I could not read this book without getting red faced with frustration every other sentence. One of the most hyperbolic, poorly researched (in terms of actual scientific studies) pieces of hysteria I have read in a long time. The accolades given to Gary Taubes are beyond confusing. His fervent advocacy supported by limited peer reviewed work and even junk science reminds me of another popular cause du jour, the anti-vaxxer movement. The fact that he has taken to consorting with a dangerous self-promoting snake oil salesman like anti-vaccine/anti-mammogram advocate Joe Mercola tells me all that I need to know about his agenda. It isn’t for the betterment of society; it is to stake a claim in a controversial realm that will help enrich himself even if its foundation is built on a bold face lie. As for the book, the constant quoting of 50, 70 and even 100 plus year old newspaper articles or books, detailing the intricacies of how early cereal makers came to add sugar to their product or spending an annoying amount of time explaining how tobacco is processed doesn’t make for actual science or a good read. All it does is give the illusion of it for those too ignorant or lazy to see past the dog and pony show that is The Case Against Sugar. If he spent more time reading actual peer reviewed research, or even conducted some himself, the book would have been better served. Instead he comes in with an agenda on page one and twist and shapes what little research he does present to ensure that it fits into his preconceived box, ignoring what isn't convenient to his argument and using massive amounts of fluff to fill in any gaps and draw unsubstantiated conclusions.On one hand the author claims that science has proved his theories as correct, (they haven’t, in fact an institute he helped found argues against many of his beliefs, oops) and on the other he attacks any and every scientist that disagrees as being a shill for “big sugar”. The outrageous claims he pushes (sugar has killed more people in the last century than war or guns) are ludicrous. He states early on that all, ALL, diseases are caused by sugar “There is clearly enough evidence to indict sugar as the single prominent environmental trigger of disease,”. This sets the stage to be able to make the previous claim that big sugar is essentially committing mass murder on a global scale using the declaration that it is the root cause as proof. All without providing any evidence to back either assertion up.Why after reading this book would anyone take him serious is beyond me. I would posit that most people aren’t actually “reading” the book and understating what he says and, more importantly, doesn’t say. But rather looking for an example to point to while they pat themselves on the back for being so enlightened. Look, we all know sugar is bad when consumed in large amounts. I guess it just isn’t sexy enough to point out that we need to practice much better moderation as we should with all things. It is much easier to come out all crazy like screaming that the sky is falling and suggesting that the government make its use illegal. At least that sells books"
8,1524709077,http://goodreads.com/user/show/83141-jdk1962,4,"I happened to be reading this at the same time as I was listening to a three-part Freakonomics podcast series called ""Bad Medicine,"" and they both hit on the same problem: the emphasis upon ""eminence-based"" medicine, rather than evidence-based medicine, i.e., if a renowned practitioner is behind a hypothesis, that can be enough to direct, or at least influence, decades of research and practice. This is especially critical in the science of sugar, because Taubes' point is that the damage done by sugar is not something that can be easily researched. The damage--if it is indeed caused by sugar--takes not days or weeks but decades to manifest, and it would require literally billions of dollars of research to establish a firm scientific link. But the case that Taubes presents is pretty alarming, especially showing that, as aboriginal peoples are introduced to the ""Western diet,"" a host of ""Western diseases"" start showing up.Taubes' book does a good job of laying out the case, but perhaps falls short in a prescriptive sense. Eat less or no sugar is about the long and short of it. And of course, take the medical advice of those being funded by the sugar industry very, very skeptically. FYI, as someone who works in finance, I thought the quote from C.W. Barron, about investing in vices, was quite interesting, so I actually set up an index focusing on gambling, alcohol, tobacco, and carbonated beverage producers (setting up and testing indices is what I do for a living). In the period from 1999-2016, the annualized return was approximately 3X greater than the S&P500 over the same period, with lower standard deviation and drawdown, and higher Sharpe ratio and dividend yield. So, Barron was on to something...though I'd personally be pretty queasy about investing in such an index."
9,1524709077,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23830021-peter-karlin,1,You will require sugar to stay awake during this book. I've read far more interesting articles on the subject.

It's hard to grasp the huge impact of refined sugar on human evolution, and - once again - thanks to greedy lobbies, we happily march towards our doom, so that the sugar industry barons may continue to enjoy the profits of providing us with our drug of choice. It's unbelievable that governments try to regulate recreational drugs, at the same time when one of the most toxic inventions of humanity is virtually promoted as a healthy alternative to the ""oh-so-dangerous"" fat. I know that all this sounds like a huge overstatement, and I wish it was, but sadly the evidence is here, and choosing not to see it does not make it less valid. Read the book, and weep. But don't eat candy to alleviate the pain (ice cream is kind of OK though - huh?!)Oh, hell, I need to stop reading books on nutritional subjects...

Taubes is a good explainer even if I still wonder about his tendency to zoom in on a particular diet ""vice"" - it was fat and now it's sugar. (His Why We Get Fat was over-simplified almost to the point of inaccuracy, but it turns out to have been a sloppy distillation of his Good Fats, Bad Fats.) This new book doesn't offer self-help advice, but serves several other purposes: a history of sugar and how it entered the human diet, a physiology lesson on human diseases (esp. diabetes and metabolic syndrome), an exposé of the hypocrisies and manipulations of the food industry (e.g. adding sugar to every processed food product), and a critique of how twentieth- and twenty-first century nutrition science has failed to recognize the dangers of dietary sugar. He explains how difficult it is to isolate sugar as the culprit of not only diabetes and obesity but also cancer, high blood pressure, and dementia, but explains why the clues are all there. If ""sitting is the new smoking"" (i.e., is as bad as), then sugar is the new salt, fat, smoking, inactivity (i.e., not only as bad as, but possibly worse than)."
12,1524709077,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12800930-bharath,3,"The title says it all – sugar is not good for us. While that is evident from the title, the book has a great deal of detail and history to back up this claim. Diabetes is rising all over the world. In most countries, the disease is multiplying so rapidly that a significant portion of the population either already has diabetes or is at great risk. Why then is the medical community and governments not really alarmed. As it turns out, research especially in the past has been significantly corrupted with sugar industry sponsored research and also conflicting viewpoints. The evidence which the author quite painstakingly assembles does indicate that sugar is to blame for a number of ailments of modern times including heart ailments, and possibly even cancer. While, most seem to consider fat as the main culprit, in combination with other lifestyle issues such as inadequate exercise, quite possibly sugar has a far greater detrimental impact.I liked the way the case against sugar is built up – with a lot of history, research and statistics. And yet, matter tends to repeat and the book could be been far more crisp for the matter it contains. Some notes on the sugar from natural foods such as fruits could have been discussed.An important book to read nevertheless – definitely recommended."
13,1524709077,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4780559-chris,2,I'll save you some time. Too much sugar may be bad for you. I hope you were sitting down for that insight. This book was a mixed bag. The epidemiological data associating the increased consumption of sugar with metabolic syndrome was fascinating. Disappointing was the lack of hard scientific studies defining exactly why that is - sucrose and liver are highlighted and vaguely but not conclusively associated with fatty liver. Ponderous was the third of the book vilifying the sugar industry. They're a company selling a legal product making them a hyper villain is just too 1990. Would I recommend this one? No. Just lay off the sugar and corn syrup.

We would never dream of giving kids alcohol or a cigarette, but sugar has nutritional value, so it's OK, right? Not exactly. I credit Dr. Oz for introducing me to the diseases of metabolic syndrome almost 20 years ago. In that episode he also talked about why sugar is so bad for you. Let me paraphrase: eating sugar is like having sharp razor blades tearing up your arteries. Well, that's an image that has never left me. Once I realized just how much sugar was in everything we ate, I removed most of the white and processed foods from our home. Most of the actual sugar too. However, I have a sweet tooth, and that's an understatement. I've given up on sugar, and fallen off the wagon, and then got on again. I've learned much about the formulation of fat, sugar, and salt in foods to create a bliss point (and if you have yet to read that book by Michael Moss, would highly recommend it). This is another book to help my brain cement why I want to get off the sugar ride. I found the history of sugar fascinating, and there is much research and studies covered here that should be talked about on the news daily. Our lack of health is a clear and present danger, and we only seem to be getting sicker, so where is the outrage? There is so much I learned here, like how tobacco soaked in sugar is the technology that made the industry take flight. Sugar is not your friend, and yet somehow we cannot celebrate or mourn or relax or take a breather without a hit. Learning more about the powerful forces behind this industry was eye opening. The reason I deducted a star was because the writing is rather stilted and a bit of slog to get through at times. Still, there are so many sections highlighted in my copy for review. If you've never read about this topic I'd suggest starting with the book mentioned earlier and then make your way here. As an aside, this sweet toothed sugar junkie is off the sugar ride, and it has been way easier than I would have ever believed possible. Now, that is truly sweet."

17,1524709077,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31242781-scott-diamond,3,"This book wasn't what I'd hoped. I do believe we consume too much sugar and that it is detrimental to our health but the evidence provided in this book was far from overwhelming. In fairness. as the author points out, we don't get to conduct the experiment of eating a high sugar diet w/o the rest of the factors of modern western society. The book itself has quite a bit of discussion of the history of sugar, sugar lobby, FDA history etc but it isn't until about 2/3rds through the book that he presents evidence on health issues. Much of the book has info that anyone who has been reading in media has heard before. The author also doesn't address some controversial issues. For example he defines sugar broadly (including high fructose corn syrup). But he doesn't provide guidance on eating fruit. If sugar is as bad as he suggests then wouldn't it follow that we should also not eat very much fruit? This is largely not discussed. The book did get me to reaffirm my desire to eat healthier and the history was somewhat interesting but I didn't get much more than that from it. "
18,1524709077,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7278262-sher,5,"A stunning indictment against sugar and the way Big Sugar has manipulated people's desires and addictions, so they cannot do without sugar. 2/3 of Americans will be Type Two Diabetic within 20 years. People literally are addicted to sugar and carbs. It's incredible the way food manufactures have destroyed the health of people, especially low income folks. Making them want more and more. The other section of the book I really enjoyed was the first third, which traces the historical connection of sugar - how sugar was made, and the slave industry around sugar, and how sweets relate to the primitive diet. Well researched and clearly written. Get an education - so you know - it is not your fault you love sugar, it's been programmed into your biology, and you are being controlled by monied interests. You cannot avoid sugar until you actually detox from it. Period. But, when you do-- enjoy a feeling of empowerment and freedom beyond anything you have experienced so far. To just have sugar be no big deal anymore. Wouldn't that be lovely? "

The author's goal is to link the sugar industry's cover up of the enormous damage that sugar has done to what the tobacco industry did with smoking. The old Watergate question of What did they know and when did they know it is especially apt. I read Sugar Blues in the 70's and it was an attack on sugar; this is more an attack on an industry that knew the damage they were doing but there was too much money involved for them to stop. It's also an indictment of a scientific community that can be paid off. It is very much worth the read.
20,1524709077,http://goodreads.com/user/show/196558-denise-cormaney,5,"Every American needs to read this book.This isn't a diet book. There are no diet plans, no recipes, nothing about losing weight. He isn't a doctor trying to get rich by selling a book based on the latest food craze. Taubes is a science writer, and he presents evidence to prove that sugar is the cause of every modern disease in the Western world. Sound like an exaggeration? It isn't. He makes a solid case.Unless you have gone deep into the research yourself, you probably believe what we've all been told: -Sugar is essentially harmless. Yes, you shouldn't eat a lot because it is ""empty calories"" and has no nutritional value. You don't want too many of your daily calories spent on food that doesn't have any essential vitamins and minerals. But in moderation, there's nothing wrong with the occasional sweet treat as long as the rest of your diet is ""healthy"". (wrong)-People who are obese eat too much and move too little. It's all about energy balance (calories in/calories out). (wrong)-Dietary fat causes chronic disease (obesity, heart disease, cancer); specifically butter, eggs, dairy, and fatty meats. You order your pancakes with a side of turkey bacon, thinking you're making a healthy choice. (wrong)This book is dense with facts, but it is a compelling read. Parts of it made me *so* angry. People, we have been lied to, and it's killing us. Taubes gives us the history of the sugar lobby (which Franklin Roosevelt called ""the most powerful pressure group that has descended on the national capital during our lifetime."" In the '60s, the Silver Anvil Award went to the Madison Avenue firm the Sugar Association hired to wage a sugar-defense campaign. The award was for ""the forging of public opinion."" The purpose of that campaign? To assure the public that sugar is safe. In 1964 a Scottish physician was quoted in The Lancet as saying: ""The refining of sugar may yet prove to have been a greater tragedy for civilized man than the discovery of tobacco."") They used their influence to suppress scientific research and to sway politicians to affect public policy. The parallels to the tobacco industry are clear. It's infuriating when you read the studies and the history that Taubes presents in this book.But we expect industries to make money at the expense of the public. The part that was really infuriating was how the NIH has played a major role in this. They had studies dating from the '40-'60s that showed it was sugar, not dietary fat, that raises triglycerides. They had studies showing that too much sugar causes metabolic syndrome. But here's the pivotal moment that got us to where we are now: in the late 1960's, the NIH set out to confirm this hypothesis: ""a low-fat diet plus blood pressure medication will help people live longer."" In 1982 they published the results, and THEY FAILED TO CONFIRM THE HYPOTHESIS. Men on low-fat diets suffered MORE deaths than men who ate more fat. They ran a second trial using cholesterol-lowering meds, and published the results in 1984. The results showed that the meds helped, but just barely. Based on that study alone, the NIH, concerned about deaths from heart disease, ASSUMED that if a cholesterol-lowering drug helped reduce deaths, it should be the recommendation for all people over the age of two to eat a low-fat diet. They undertook a massive public relations campaign to sell a low-fat, high-carb diet, and we've been living with the consequences ever since. The NIH did the study again, this time with women, starting in the early '90s. They published their results in 2006, and once again, they failed to confirm the hypothesis. MORE WOMEN DIED EATING A LOW-FAT DIET, one with whole grains and less red meat, than women who ate more fat. And yet the official recommendations haven't changed. You can thank the sugar lobby for that. They benefit from our collective ignorance.And can't we see that this is true? All we have to do is look around and see that we are getting more and more unhealthy. Think this sounds crazy? Try giving up all sugar for a week (read your labels, it's in everything) and see how you feel. That first week will be HARD, because you are addicted. It's as addicting as cocaine. As someone who has struggled with weight, this book confirmed what I know to be true from personal experience. It's not about eating less. Some people are genetically predisposed to being sensitive to sugar. If you are, then you will have a hormonal, metabolic response to sugar that will only get worse over time. Your body will secrete too much insulin, which will then cause you to store those calories as fat. That body fat then secretes its own hormones, putting you into a state called Metabolic Syndrome. No amount of calorie reduction will lead to permanent weight loss. Eventually your body will become insulin-resistant. This is why you can eat a low-fat diet of only 1200 calories and exercise everyday, and still remain overweight! If you restrict calories you may lose weight at first, but you will gain it all back (just google ""The Biggest Loser contestants"" and read about how they've all ended up heavier than when they started.)Taubes also gives evidence that sugar is at the root of cancer and dementia. He has less evidence to present here (compared to the overwhelming evidence tying sugar to heart disease and diabetes), but he does have peer-reviewed, scientific studies to back up these claims. The research here is new and still emerging, but the correlation is undeniable (i.e. cancer and dementia are nearly nonexistent in cultures that don't eat a Western diet, but then appear within one-to-two generations when a culture adopts a Western diet). I know this is a bummer. We love our sweets. We can't imagine celebrating a birthday without a cake, or Christmas without a gajillion treats. We associate love and comfort with our favorite foods, with Grandma's cookies. I'm the same way. We think that this is how we've always done things, but as you'll read in this book, refined sugar hasn't been around that long. Maybe if we can wean ourselves off sugar, we could get to a place where we truly only eat it a few times a year. (Could a former smoker have a cigarette only two or three times a year...? Is that even possible?) Sigh.Every American needs to read this book."

If this were a criminal case, The Case Against Sugar would be the argument for the prosecution
And if I were the judge in the case, I would probably struggle to resist turning up for the first day in court wearing a black cap to signal the pre-ordained outcome of the trial – an outcome the cover of the book anticipates with its sugary noose. My own distillation of current wisdom on diet would probably be something like “everything in moderation, except refined sugar which you should avoid as much as you can”. So I am predisposed towards the arguments of this book, which would go even further than my initial fears about sugar, by seeking to pin almost all modern/Western illnesses (gout, hypertension, even cancer and Alzheimer’s) back to sugar via its effects on insulin resistance and disturbances on hormonal and metabolic processes.Nevertheless I struggled when reading this book. Were it a court case of course Taubes own witnesses would be subject to cross examination by the defense, and the defense case itself would be presented (with Taubes having the opportunity to cross examine their witnesses, but with those witnesses being able to respond to that cross examination).Instead we get a one sided case – with witnesses (normally nutritionists or those in the associated fields of medical science) for the defense quoted selectively and with their conclusions and motives (normally that they are in some way funded by the sugar or associated industry – either to defend that industry or to deflect blame elsewhere, most successfully to dietary fats) impugned by the prosecution; whereas witnesses for the prosecution (effectively drawn from the same bodies, albeit with more emphasis on medical scientists than nutritionists who Taubes believe lack the rigour of the scientific method) given a free ride (we are for example never told if any of their work was funded by those industries associated with dietary fats) and some of their studies are blatantly subject to the same faults (often selective sampling or confirmation bias) as those Taubes criticises.Taubes also I feel lacks sometimes scientific rigour – the very fact he accuses other (particularly nutritionists of). He applies the principle of Occam’s razor to argue against a multi-factor (for example bad cholesterol fats, sedentary lifestyles) cause of Western illnesses – arguing the principle means you should seek for only a single cause. As a statistician I struggle with this conclusion when it is not backed up by some form of multi-variate analysis. He also seems to confuse correlation with causality and this (like his Occam’s razor approach) is crucial to his refection of a multi-factor cause.And the book is much the weaker for these two faults – as despite the overwhelming evidence I wanted to hear the counter arguments and weigh them up for myself. I was reminded in this respect of a number of books on man made climate change – where despite being pre-disposed towards their conclusions their selective polemic actually meant the books made me more rather than less unsure of them by the time.So overall definitely an important book – for anyone who is a sugar-is-bad sceptic (or thinks there is no difference between a sugar calorie and another calorie) I would strongly recommended it. For those already convinced of the sugar-is-bad hypothesis you will find much here to confirm your views (if that is what you are after) but little to help you test and (if I can be pardoned the pun) refine them."
22,1524709077,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2199404-andy,4,"Taubes is a very good writer and makes a good case against sugar, but he already did that in two previous books. What he adds here is some more explanation of why the authorities keep saying sugar is not the problem even in instances where the evidence shows that it clearly is. He also makes a good argument about if sugar is the main culprit behind metabolic syndrome, then it's a big deal for lots of diseases other than just obesity itself. He even makes a solid argument for sugar's role in the lung cancer pandemic. I think he pushes things too far when he reacts against Big Junk's use of multi-factor causality as an excuse to dismiss sugar's role. Sugar can be one cause and even the major cause, AND there can still be other causes (stress, plastics, microbiome, whatever). I think he could get more people on his side by settling for sugar as A cause vs. THE cause. But I can understand his frustration when all these authorities are still, for example, telling diabetic people that toast with maple syrup is a good breakfast, and still pushing cereal with sugared non-fat milk for schoolchildren. Given that the book is called ""The case against sugar"" I think it's OK that he's not bending over backward to be even-handed. "
23,1524709077,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1045774-mehrsa,4,"I literally stopped eating sugar the second I finished this book, but ahh my kids are addicted. I think if I were to pick one Taubes book, it would be the why we get fat book because it has better research. he makes a lot of crazy claims here that are unsupported, but that I guess I kind of buy. I mean, I don't think sugar causes cancer and alzheimers because those diseases started appearing once we started eating sugar. We started eating lots of sugar after we took care of the plague and other diseases so now we live long enough for cancer to kill us off. But does sugar make us fat? sure. Also, I'm surprised he doesn't talk much about Nelson Aldrich in his sugar history. The dude was crazy corrupt and controlled the senate and was a huge sugar mogul. I'm sure he's relevant in the origin story of why sugar was not vilified early in the century"
24,1524709077,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10369370-nicole,3,"You’re not gonna like this. But in your heart, you already know it’s true. Sugar is killing us. Slowly. It takes years and even decades to see its full effect, and that’s what makes it so insidious. After year of eating with apparent impunity, it ends in diabetes, heart disease, cancer, and Alzheimer’s. Taubes, taking an epidemiological approach to the subject, subscribes to the theory of sugar as a hormonal regulatory disrupter that has a different metabolic effect than other substances. That is, a calorie of sugar is not equal to other calories - it changes the way the body stores fat and leads to insulin resistance, a precursor to the metabolic syndrome that’s responsible for a whole host of chronic diseases. While most observers just fat-shame people for overindulging and taking in too many calories, lab studies with rats show that even when keeping calorie intake the same, the rats who had sugar still gained weight, vs those who did not. Taubes is particularly strong when he explores the role the sugar industry has played in skewing scientific research and public opinion to avoid blame for America’s health catastrophe (to include speciously discrediting artificial sweeteners.) So why only 3 stars? For starters, the bookis incredibly tedious. But also, while I completely agree that sugar is a primary cause of poor health in America, I think it’s too simplistic to boil it down to being the only cause. Nutrition is incredibly complex, and there are so many deficiencies in the diets produced by our highly processed, industrialized food system that other factors (such as saturated fat, refined flours, and sodium) cannot be completely ruled out as co-contributors. "
25,1524709077,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9555257-maria,3,"The basic premise of this book is that sugar is toxic in large amounts, and the modern diet in the United States and many other nations across the globe now incorporates far too much sugar. The primary disease of concern is diabetes, and Taubes provides a reasonably extensive history of the occurrence of diabetes and the evolution of medical theories about its primary cause. For a variety of reasons - the sugar industry being one, human stubborness being another - fat was considered the culprit for a very long time, during which time sugar insinuated itself into nearly everything we eat. It is an effective preservative, it tastes delicious, but perhaps it is poison.By the end of the book I'd grown weary; in part because it is an emotionally exhausting mental exercise to consider how so much of the food you enjoy eating is quite possibly killing you slowly, but also because Taubes never let up beating on his long dead horse. Sugar causes diabetes! And hypertension! And heart disease! And CANCER! As if the first ailment wouldn't be enough to scare us.That said, it has helped me to begin to perceive sugary foods a bit differently. For those who turn to food for comfort or stress relief or enjoyment, those feelings cannot be experienced the same way knowing what's in store. I won't eliminate sugar from my diet, but I think I probably will reduce my sugar intake by a good deal, saving it for special occasions. All things in moderation, after all."

I still eat a chocolate chip cookie whenever I see one (since they’re amazing). And it’s not sustainable for me to completely cut sugar out of my life. But I feel like I’ve gotten my addiction under control. This book reinforced the importance of that effort.I put this book in the same category as “Why We Sleep.” We are still learning a lot about the science of health. However, there are some things we know are generally correlated with good health. Get enough sleep. Don’t eat too much. Limit sugar. Eat fresh rather than processed foods. Eat your vegetables. Limit chocolate to 3 lbs per day...ok, maybe not that last one. Anyway, my guess is that the specifics of how to stay healthy will change. But it’s good to know what will generally lead to better health."

And a more accurate title for the last half would be ""Sugar is the Devil.""I enjoyed the first half of this. The historical details were fascinating. The author showed not just the history of sugar, but he also showed that when sugar became prevalent in many cultures across the the globe, disease soon followed. This part was a solid 4 stars for me.Then the last half kind of unraveled a bit. It jumped around a lot to different topics. There wasn't as much research and some of it seemed dated. I did page math a few times. Sugar is the villain here, along with the Sugar Association. But the fact that sugar isn't good for us isn't new information. Some new info/research would have been appreciated. Overall, I liked the history and the spin the author put on his platform. So 3 starsThis is my take on health books of this nature. There is always some platform. There is always an enemy. We are all going to die. Associations (like the Sugar Association, United Egg Association, the National Dairy Council, etc.,) are like teenagers when they speak.....YOU HAVE TO READ BETWEEN THE LINES. Of course they want to be looked upon in a rosy glow, but not all things that come from their direction is truth. They want you to buy what they are selling. Books of this nature are kind of the same...I feel I have to read between the lines. But I like the research and I like the spin they put on their platform.

It's very hard to feel good about eating 70% of the foods one might normally eat while listening to this book, I can't really speak on the books effect afterwards as it hasn't been long. It is eye-opening though just to come to terms with how sugar has affected me in so many different ways at pivotal moments in my life. Unfortunately it also brings to bear the same old story that underlines every industry's political past in the United States: conflict of interest. I'm starting to feel like I can't trust anything in this country as it has undoubtedly been so manipulated by duplicitous science, political manipulation, and downright lies, that there is no telling which way is what.That being said, Taubes is definitely totally against sugar, and proposes we eliminate it entirely from our diets, much as someone trying to quit smoking would have to eliminate the habit entirely instead of cutting down. This seems extreme to me, and for me personally very difficult, but I think he might just be right. "

For example, did you know the nutritionists at the cereal companies fought for years to keep sugared-cereals off the market because they knew how devastating they could be for kids? And did you know that cigarette smoking became popular and created the lung-smoking epidemic AFTER sugar-curing became popular? Soaking the tobacco leaves in sugar water before they were cured made the cigarettes taste better and made them more addictive. There's been a lot of news lately about how the sugar companies worked to keep nutritionists focused on fat being to blame for the rise in obesity and diabetes rates rather than sugar. Now we know that sugar consumption plays a major role in both. And it's harder and harder to avoid not only sugar, but all the multiple sugar substitutes, too, because it's in everything. Taubes explains all of this in a way that's easy to understand so you don't lose any of that continually building anger. "

The problem with this book is that it may be a little too intense for the average reader, or maybe I should say the book isn't dumbed down enough for the general American public. Having said that, there is a wealth of information here, including a history of the sugaring of tobacco which I had not previously known. To think smoking wasn't bad enough already, they had to add sugar to it. The author is preaching to the choir with me because I already believe that I am a sugar addict and the only way to control my sugar addiction is to stay away from it as much as possible. On the other hand, most of the people I know can handle sugar in moderation, so I'm not so sure it can be lumped in with other substances which are so harmful, like tobacco, alcohol, and other drugs. I do agree that the sugar industry has an incredible hold over the powers that be and that it is dangerous to the public health in general and that we all pay the price for the damage it does. "

While I found the overall argument quite convincing, what I found lacking, surprisingly, was a definition of what sugar is. Taubes thoroughly explains that high-fructose corn syrup is quite similar to sucrose in composition (55% fructose as opposed to 50%), which was helpful. But I'm still confused about effects of sugar described throughout the book being attributed to glucose vs fructose, especially regarding glycemic index effects. Furthermore, the author sometimes discussed consumption of ""sweets,"" but I'd thought a reason sugar consumption has increased so drastically is its increased amounts in processed foods we don't typically consider sweet. The epilogue emphasizes that this is not a proscriptive book, but I found it so theoretical about such a practical topic that it didn't live up to its potential for me."

Perhaps - this book has done a good job of convincing me of how I need to keep a handle on my sugar intake. I still think overeating and processed food doesn’t help either, but this book isn’t like most diets that claim to be the One True Diet and then just prove to be the Exact Same Diet."

It makes a fantastic case against sugar, which leads me to conclude, personally, that avoiding it is the best way to avoid metabolic syndrome (and as Taubes notes, the insulin resistance and high triglycerides that characterize metabolic syndrome are precursors to most common modern maladies).But while I wholeheartedly agree that the food industry has done us a terrible service by highly refining grains and pumping them, as well as various other (often supposedly savory) products with sugar and HFCS, I find the condemnation of birthday cake and so on unrealistic. What's done is done. People emotionally respond to certain foods, and even if the food wreaks havoc on the body, we are all going to die sometime, so sugar must retain a place in the cultural consciousness, however limited. In conclusion: yes to avoiding sugar in everyday products, cutting out dessert, embracing whole grains, and limiting childhood exposure to sugar instead of making it a dietary mainstay. No to eradicating birthday cake."

51,1524709077,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4886576-cody,4,"The Case Against Sugar proved to be a valuable yet alarming piece of evidence on not only western dietary habits, but the lack of important studies into a wide range of nutritional health. Obviously readers of this book will begin the first page with at least a rudimentary understanding of the negative effects of sugar on a persons health, but what Gary Taubes has done here has brought a greater light on the history of the consumption of sugar. Covering everything from the business of ""big sugar"" to the introduction of it into non-western nations in case studies to the critical and hypocritical public health studies conducted by a various nutritional academics. The case studies themselves proved to be fascinating (and horrifying). In particular the effect of sugar into populations of Native Americans in the Southwestern United States, or Kenya or the islands of Tokelau, where the introduction of sugar served as a sort of ""nutritional imperialism"" which affected such populations with concerned and immediate health effects. Also was the juxtaposition of ""Big Sugar"" and ""Big Tobacco,"" two economic systems that grew up together for profit over health ambitions. It's all quite interesting in historical and sociological terms. The one complaint with the book (and this is by no means the fault of Mr. Taubes) is there isn't any actual conclusive loaded gun evidence to completely eliminate sugar from our lives. There simply haven't been enough proper studies done on the subject with regards to fully understanding its implications on our diets. ""The research community can certainly do a much better job than it has in the past testing of all these questions. But we may have a very long wait before the public-health authorities fund such studies and give us the definitive answers we seek....I've argued here that enough evidence exists for us to consider sugar very likely to be a toxic substance, and to make an informed decision about how best to balance the likely risks with the benefits."" Taubes argues for as less sugar as possible and only then can we understand just how negatively it affected our health and nutrition. Rating 4.5/5"
52,1524709077,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9057931-marianna,4,"Well..... after listening to this book, I think I may never touch sugar again..... Ugh!Let's start with the reading and recording of this book.... To say that it read like a text book would be saying it kindly... The reading was very dry and borderline boring. The material was extremely technical and required me to rewind repeatedly in order to refocus and relisten to what was being said. This is a heavy book - both with the depth and scope of knowledge in multiple disciplines including medical, health, socioeconomic, and food. So prepare yourselves for an in depth dive into the world of the human body and how it functions. I would have given this book a 5-star rating if it weren't so very dryly written; otherwise, what I learned has left me speechless. I would easily say that if you want to learn about sugar and how it impacts the human body then this is definitely the book to read or listen to. I learned more than I ever thought possible about what sugar does in the body and to the body. I must say that this book presents the facts very well with lots of historical and scientific evidence to back its points and arguments. I found the material well put together and presented. A large focus of the book was on Diabetes and its relationship with sugar and other ""Western"" Diseases. Since my husband was diagnosed with type 2 Diabetes a year ago, the information in this book was critical and relevant to my family's needs. I learned a lot of important information that I can utilize in our home to help my husband deal with, and hopefully beat, this disease. I highly recommend this book to everyone and anyone who wants to learn about a healthier live style of eating and living. This book is especially pertinent to everyone who is currently suffering from various diseases that are classified as a ""western"" disease such as diabetes, high blood pressure, pre-diabetes, and even cancer.... this book sheds light on a lot of issues that the general public seems to be in the dark about. Ignore the dryness of the writing and read the book for the content - I believe it's priceless information. Good Luck and Happy Reading!"

It is probable that sugar leads to, disease susceptibility, Alzheimers, cancer, gout, diabetes, heart disease and obesity. I will attempt to change some things about my diet, for sure. I love how well researched this book was, all the studies he quotes and how he looks at the affect of a western diet on indigenous populations that adopted it (often because they were forced to). The evidence shows, there is a pretty strong case against sugar."

It all seems so commonsense to me, but at the same time it truly is hard to avoid sugar altogether - after all, what is a Birthday without a cake? Lol. But finding out a balance with little to no sugar is worth it in the long run, as Gary Taubes has laid out all of the reasons to make the change in this book.I was very intrigued by the history of how the sugar industry has taken such advantage of the world. It is scary how money has made us so unhealthy, ill and caused far too many premature deaths via cancer and etc. This was a great read, and I feel that all humans should read it. It did take me about 3 weeks to read, (2 months if you count the breaks I took). It is a lot of information to understand, names to remember, and facts to digest. Gary Taubes' research shouldn't be brushed aside. It is a game changer and truly could save your life!"
55,1524709077,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40175257-christy,4,"Sugar has drastically changed the health of the human race. Or has it? This book gives many, many examples of groups of people throughout history who were introduced to sugar and what happened to their health. And also how it has become an ingredient in just about everything. The thing is though, that there is no way to prove that anything is actually caused by sugar, because it is usually paired with one or multiple other potentially harmful factors, hence the name of the book, The Case Against Sugar. You can't prove it, but he can argue his case. I liked this book and it will definitely make me try to consume less sugar. But as in everything, I think moderation is key. Especially when it is extremely difficult to avoid sugar (and I don't mean just treats, it's in lunch meat) in our culture. The book does drag on a bit, but it is filled with a lot of great information and ideas."

It causes more chronic diseases tan you might think.It even contributes to the bad effects of smoking. Before tobacco was being soaked in sugar water to make it more easily inhalable, it was just chewed. Now smokers inhale and the result is possibly emphysema, bronchitis and lung cancer.And, if I understand the book correctly, sugar also causes:Hypertension - caused by sugar, not salt.Heart disease - caused by sugar because it changes the metabolism of triglycerides and fatty deposits can occur in arteries. Obesity - too many calories Diabetes - caused by obesityGout - caused by diabetesInsulin Resistance exacerbates diabetesSounds like I should eliminate sugar from my diet. Hope it's not too late."

The trouble with the book is that is is extremely repetitive. By the third of fourth chapter I was quickly growing bored by the details of his arguments because they seemed to be the same details as the argument made three or four times in the chapters previous. On the other hand the weight of evidence compiled makes a very good case and I will need to be even more vigilant in seeking to reduce sugar from my diet. Realistically I don't think I could ever entirely eliminate it as the author suggests would be best, at least not unless society in general makes that more possible."

The research is thorough and convincing, without the presentation being patronising or prescriptive.What I like best for myself is how this book gives me one more point of view to a number of events in the history of science, and so convinces me of the truthfulness of the relayed facts, as well as to ignore most of current main-stream nutrition advice, making my own conclusions and decisions instead.For me, the case against sugar is overwhelming. The sad and pitiful fact, however, is that there is no definite research being funded to figure out why and how exactly sugar may be in the roots of our bodies starting to malfunction in various ways."
59,1524709077,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3183576-cheri,5,"A real tour de force on the part of the author. The most fascinating part of this book is how we come to believe what we do about how things work, and how constant repetition of something can make it ""true."" (It's definitely a lesson for our times in many ways.) I have long doubted many things I learned in school (I'm a dietitian), but Taubes convinced me that sugar is probably even worse than I had thought. He is careful to make clear that there's so much we don't know, and may never know, but that doesn't mean there isn't a reasonable course of action. I do wish he would have discussed white wheat flour and its relation to refined sugar -- maybe his next book?"

In recounting the last 400 or so years of sugar use (since New World colonization and slavery made widespread use possible) and correlating that with the rise of ""Western diseases"", Taube makes an extremely persuasive circumstantial case that those delicious little granules are the cause of many modern medical woes. Without serious, and difficult to carry out, testing the case cannot be said to be proven, but the detailed and well-argued proposal is convincing. Everyone who ever eats sweets needs to read this book."

He recognizes that sugar is so permeated in our culture that its unavoidable. But I know that there are others who have written the strategy books, so it's good to have the research to back up the diet."

67,1524709077,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17315128-meredith,4,"I’m familiar with Gary Taubes from his wonderful book, “Good Calories, Bad Calories”, which I think should be required reading for anyone who is truly interested in how our diets affect our health, and how standard “guidelines” (which are actually government mandated rules) were formed in opposition to what actually should happen.In this latest book, Taubes shifts his focus away from carbohydrate consumption in general, and directly onto sugar itself. The consumption of sugar in the diet, in any form, is a dietary scourge in the western world and causes enormous misery and heartache. Most people are fiercely addicted to sugar, despite the fact that it makes them fat and miserable, and it is implicated in the prevalence of overweight, obesity, diabetes, metabolic syndrome and autoimmune disorders. The conventional advice about diet doesn’t include room for any alternative to the low-fat, high-carbohydrate, grain-starch-and-sugar based option. The focus of this book is on how diabetes and its related afflictions have arisen and become terribly common, right alongside the increase in sugar consumption and demonization of fat. If you suffer from any chronic issue, even unspecified ones such as constipation, indigestion, headaches, allergies, acne, dandruff, eczema, insomnia and other annoyances, look at the amount of sugar, starch and carbohydrate that you consume. I am willing to bet that giving up all the garbage will make a huge difference to the daily performance, health and well being of most people."
68,1524709077,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1456953-sharon,5,"This is the third of Gary Taubes's books on nutrition and chronic diseases. I'm still plowing my way through the second one -- Good Calories, Bad Calories. As the title makes clear, the focus here is on sugar and the evidence for its role in producing and exacerbating the chronic diseases that come under the umbrella term of metabolic syndrome or ""diseases of Western civilization"": hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes and pre-diabetes, hypertension, obesity, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, cardiovascular disease, stroke, and cancer.The research needed to prove with scientific rigor the cause and effect relationship is lacking, partly because the sugar industry has successfully blocked it using the same tactics that the cigarette industry used for decades, and partly because so much of the processed foodlike substances available to us also contain large amounts of fat and salt and other ingredients. It's difficult and expensive to plan and execute studies that can separate the effect of cutting sugar consumption from the effect of cutting any of those, and the sugar industry has used that uncertainty to its advantage.This book, and his other two on this subject, are pleas for better nutrition science, and for better tests of the assumptions about a healthy diet that have been accepted for too long without that evidence."
69,1524709077,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8273355-dru,5,"WOW.As a scientist, I am fascinated by two components of this book1) The level of historic research and detail was extensive2) The general awfulness of the ""medical research community"", especially in America and especially when driven by a corporationThis book makes a VERY compelling case that sugar leads to metabolic syndrome, then insulin resistance and then obesity/diabetes/cancer/gout/Alzheimer's/heart disease. It is shameful, really, the way evidence is either overlooked or else ignored. The billions of dollars the sugar industry has had to spend on ""research"" (read ""do any science as long as it makes sugar look good and anything else, like ""fat"" or ""general caloric intake"" or ""artificial sweeteners"" look bad) means that the world has been subjected to a misleading set of conclusions and presumptions that get drilled into our collective psyche and stay there. By way of example, ask yourself this: Is high ""LDL cholesteral a problem that might lead to heart disease? Does eating saturated fats lead to heart disease? The answer seems to be not only ""no"", but ""no, because trials have proven it so, while trials of sugar are much more definitively 'yes'""But that's the rub...small trials in rats aren't large, decades long studies of human populations in controlled environments. Such studies might cost billions of dollars, and the sugar industry has a very high stake in making sure such studies are NEVER done.Do yourself a favor and read this book. I'll never look at sugar the same way again."
70,1524709077,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4218115-jonas-saul,4,"Overall, extremely informative, but I felt it bogged down in details of the past. There were at least one thousand dates and times of different findings over the course of history regarding sugar ... it all became a blur. I was able to glean what I wanted to hear, though.Four stars because it was well done and informative, but the author lost a star because it was actually too much data. I simply wanted to be better educated about sugar - I'm not writing a thesis on it."

If you're not, then be prepared to have your mind blown on how bad the stuff is and how it promotes so many of the diseases (cancer, gout, diabetes, etc.) that kill us daily in the western world. There's also a couple of interesting chapters in here on how notorious the sugar industry has been in in trying to disprove what has now become obvious truths. Reminds me of the tobacco industry, and today's political environment.... "
72,1524709077,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50448-becky,4,"First sentence: What if Roald Dahl and Michael Pollan are right, that the taste of sugar on the tongue can be a kind of intoxication? Doesn't it suggest the possibility that sugar itself is an intoxicant, a drug? Imagine a drug that can intoxicate us, can infuse us with energy, and can do so when taken by mouth. It doesn't have to be injected, smoked, or snorted for us to experience its sublime and soothing effects. Imagine that it mixes well with virtually every food and particularly liquids, and that when given to infants it provokes a feeling of pleasure so profound that intense that its pursuit becomes a driving force throughout their lives.  Premise/plot: Taubes argues in his newest book that sugar--both sucrose and high fructose corn syrup--is the principal cause of several (in fact many) diseases that are most likely to kill us. Taubes' book is a thorough examination of the subject. Chapters include:  Introduction: Why Diabetes? Drug or Food? The First Ten Thousand Years The Marriage of Tobacco and Sugar A Peculiar Evil The Early (Bad) Science The Gift That Keeps On Giving Big Sugar Defending Sugar What They Didn't Know The If/Then Problem: I The If/Then Problem: II How Little Is Still Too Much?Essentially, he argues against the status quo of nutritionists and scientists, those that would say it's dietary fat that makes you fat. That it is fat and salt in our diets that lead to disease. He argues against the idea that it is overeating and sedentary lifestyles that are making us fat--obese--and leading to more health problems. He carefully examines the evidence, the research. Just because someone claims to back up their claims with ""the latest research"" doesn't make it legit. There are hundreds--if not thousands--of ways to approach studies for research. Some more reliable than others. The results of studies have to be interpreted. And two people looking at the same set of facts can reach two very different, often contradictory conclusions. Research studies with humans often fail to consider all the factors going on. And animal studies, well, they may prove how mouse or rat biology work, but, don't always correlate well with us. Taubes argues that there is bias involved as well. If your research is funded exclusively by the sugar industry, well....let's just say that the sugar industry has spent decades defending sugar and excels at public relations. (And the sugar industry is not alone.)Taubes examines both sides in a way. He looks at the research that says dietary fat is to blame and that sugar is harmless. He critiques those studies, those conclusions. He then presents his own views. How does the body digest sugar? What is the effect of sugar on the body? What are the short-term effects? What are the long-term effects? What if scientists have gotten the cause and effect mixed up? What if its sugar which leads to obesity which leads to metabolic syndrome which leads to diabetes which leads to heart disease which leads to this that and the other? What if sugar isn't harmless? Why are people so unwilling to consider the idea that sugar is the culprit? Why are people more willing to give up meat than sugar--to blame fat than sugar? To blame ANYTHING than sugar? Why aren't people asking more questions and looking at things from a common sense approach? Whether your interest is in history, science, nutrition, or culture, Taubes' book may keep you reading. One thing it is not is a diet book, a how-to-lose-weight-and-be-the-best-you book. I'd describe the book as thorough, well-documented, and logical. It is his attempt to reason with you--with skeptics, with critics, with anyone and everyone who assumes that sugar is harmless and that a calorie is a calorie is a calorie is a calorie. My thoughts: I'll be honest. I wanted to file this one in the horror genre. Some of the facts are truly horrifying in terms of what it means to human society, to the human race. At times I felt Taubes was a bit pessimistic, abandon hope all ye who have ever eaten sugar.  I'm going to guess that most readers will find his ""no amount of sugar is safe to consume"" guideline a bit too unrealistic and strict. But regardless of whether Taubes motivates you to give up processed foods and sugar, his book is thought-provoking. He gets you thinking about what you're consuming that's for sure. Diabetes is a subject that I care very deeply about. I think it's a dangerous disease because the dangers--the effects of the disease--are not immediate. It's really easy to think it doesn't really matter if I eat that cookie or not. It's easy to cling to the idea that you'll straighten out your diet tomorrow, next week, next month, next year. That there is always time to get it under control. But the truth is every day counts. That it is serious, that it should be taken seriously. That it can lead to head-to-toe health problems. If you've ever witnessed someone die from complications related to diabetes, you know what I'm talking about."

76,1524709077,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1919089-ido,5,"An excellent book that makes a strong case for the impact that sugar has had on the health of Americans and other cultures and societies worldwide. While I understand the frustration of many readers with the issue that Gary uses older source materials in the first part of the book this, in my mind, does not detract from the impact of the information. Sugar consumption has been increasing considerably since the early 1900s and there is a correlation of that with the increase in obesity and diabetes both here and worldwide. Now, yes, I know the argument - ""correlation does not prove causation"" - and there are websites devoted to proving this (if you're interested, see here: http://www.tylervigen.com/spurious-co...) - but in this case we're not talking about two completely disparate issues - sugar is a food (or at least an ingredient in food) and obesity and diabetes are related to food in one way or another. The biochemistry of sugar processing is well known and has been for years - the glucose and fructose are split with the body processing the glucose for energy (or storing it in the liver as glycogen) but fructose is not a usable form of energy for the body to process. It's the fructose that Taubes points to as the source of the problem. The sugar industry presents a picture where sugar is a harmless product and a calorie is just a calorie. Obesity and diabetes are pictured as diseases of laziness and gluttony rather than a more modern view of them linked to a specific component of our diet. On top of that the medical community has been fixated on the idea that hypertension, heart disease, and others are linked directly to the saturated fat in our diet. Taubes does a good job in pushing that aside and arguing that all of these issues - obesity, diabetes, hypertension, heart disease and possibly other conditions are more directly attributable - in not outright linked - to the dramatic increase in our sugar consumption.The issue I have with Taubes book however is his lack of academic rigidity on the subject. He continually makes statements such as ""It seems that..."" or ""It's possible that..."" and he needs to be more certain in the science. While I feel that he has certainly convinced me that there is something there that should be investigated much further it requires more that the individual researcher here and there (and there are individuals who are pursuing this - Dr. Robert Lustig, a pediatric endocrinologist at the UC San Francisco medical school comes to mind) to really vet this possible - and plausible - connection."
77,1524709077,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1821473-christianne,3,"My big takeaway from this book is there is a lack of conclusive research showing how specific foods and nutrients affect our health. The belief that saturated fat and salt cause heart disease and high blood pressure became conventional wisdom and yet was based on no conclusive studies.Research on diets and the effects of specific foods on our health requires huge numbers of research subjects who are studied for decades. These types of studies don't get funded and so we are left with mostly circumstantial evidence.Taubes build a good case against sugar and certainly builds a good case against the sugar industry that was extremely effective in getting Westerners to consume ever greater amounts of sugar. The evidence he cites to implicate sugar in the epidemics of obesity, metabolic syndrome, and diabetes is compelling and yet he is careful to say that we cannot know for sure if sugar is the main or even a major cause of these chronic diseases. I appreciate his research and his honesty.I am left with my own observations about how sugar affects my health. I know that I find sugar addicting; it's hard to just have one cookie, and it's hard to eat sugar in moderation. When I stop eating sugar, I find it easier to control my weight. There aren't as many abrupt changes in my mood or energy level when I am off sugar. I also think my joints feel less achy. Taubes research and my personal observation make me want to say goodbye to sugar forever. So, will I do it?"

79,1524709077,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47481919-c-patrick-g-erker,5," Sugar is toxic and I need to stop eating it immediately. That's the main takeaway from this book, which I listened to through Overdrive and the San Francisco Public Library on the recommendation of a friend through Goodreads.  Gary Taubes has reached me with one of those books that will change the way I behave on a day-to-day basis - at least as long as I have the memories top of mind. In short, sugar might be worse than tobacco for our health. And no amount of intake is guaranteed to be little enough not to be too much. (He makes a great analogy here: when we're giving people advice about how many cigarette to smoke, we don't say, just a few a day should be ok. We say none.) The differences between sugar and tobacco, of course, are myriad. For a couple: 1. the impact of tobacco is seen faster and there is incontrovertible evidence for its causal relationship with various forms of cancer and other bad things; 2. almost everyone in the west consumes sugar. That said, the author's narrative of the history of sugar, combined with his review of the scientific literature, make for a convincing case against sugar. While he admits that some of his assertions about sugar aren't cut and dry (the degree of its connections with cancer, Alzheimer's, or other ""western diseases,"" or its impacts across generations), he brings enough evidence, circumstantial and other, to convince me that I need to dramatically cut my sugar consumption (which I thought was low to begin with). I learned quite a bit from the book, both about history and science. I knew sugar was big business, but wasn't aware of the extent to which it made (or in some cases destroyed) entire economies, created sugar barons of similar wealth to oil and tech barons, and led to untold suffering of workers. I knew it was bad for you in excess, but I hadn't considered applying Occam's razor to the question of why westerners are so fat and unhealthy. I knew that the low-fat diet craze was a bit of a sham, but I didn't realize it had been essentially funded by the food industry. I knew that paleo-type diets were great (I'd done it in the past), but hadn't realized what dramatic increases in sugar consumption by populations previously isolated and on various forms of ""paleo-esque"" diets (e.g., the people of Tokelau in New Zealand or the Zuni Indians in the US Southwest) did to those populations' health outcomes (hint: the effects of sugar make one think somebody should be prosecuted for impacts on unsuspecting new sugar fiends). In today's America, luckily, opprobrium pours on the racist, the sexist, the insensitive. One group that lacks general protection from ridicule are those struggling with obesity. America is FAT. I have to admit that I myself sometimes wonder how America is so fat, when in my observations while we eat more, we don't eat that much more than other folks. I often wonder how it is that people with seemingly small amounts of caloric intake still end up overweight or obese. When the impact of sugar is considered, it makes a lot more sense. If you think about sugar as changing the way the body converts calories into its own uses, messing with insulin levels, overloading the body's natural response mechanisms, things come into clearer view. I found myself thinking about the videos where people drop coins or pennies into Coke, and watch what happens to the metal. And I think about what sugary candy does to teeth. How can we reasonably expect that sugary drinks and foods DON'T have toxic, harmful effects on our insides? (Now I sound like a crazy person, perhaps. But seriously, if you take the author seriously, which I do, it's a bit hard not to reevaluate your relationship with sugar.) I had read Peter Singer's Animal Liberation before this book, and so now I feel guilty eating animals and sugar. I suppose next up I'll have to read Michael Pollan and follow his advice to ""eat food, mostly plants, not too much."" (I have not yet read any Pollan, but plan to do so.) The book was definitely an instant classic for me. Where did it fall short? I wish the author were a bit more prescriptive about what he thinks the key players should do in the face of the sugary world we're in. What should the CDC be advising? The FDA? Food companies? Parents? I understand that he wants to leave the choice to individuals, but given the alarmism of the core thesis, I'd have expected a bit more of ""here's what we need to do ASAP."" So grab a cold water and some broccoli, and enjoy this one."

I really liked the structure of the book and how it was organized. Definitely looking forward to rereading in the future. 
81,1524709077,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60642644-kim-panian,2,"I agree with the underlying premise that sugar is bad for you but this book takes it to the extreme and equates sugar to cocaine. The author lost major credibility when he began to frequently insult medical professionals and went so far as to suggest they all take a course on ignorance. Overly sensational and reliant on cherry picked evidence. I enjoyed the historical information on certain foods such as the invention of sugared cereal and soft drinks but the book often strayed into preachy/sermon territory with little to back up its conjectural statements. The tone of the book comes across as though the author has a messiah complex since everyone in the medical profession is stupid while the author, a journalist without a medical degree, has special insight unbeknownst to everyone else. Science isn't a legal argument where one party stacks evidence in support of its own theory, and even if it was a legal argument the author doesn't make any effort whatsoever to address counterarguments against his various wide-sweeping theories. According to Taubes, sugar causes high blood pressure, cancer, Alzheimer's disease, and pretty much every major illness you can think of. "
82,1524709077,http://goodreads.com/user/show/834122-vegantrav,5,"Guilty. That's my verdict.Gary Taubes presents the case against sugar so thoroughly and convincingly that I have to vote that sugar is guilty as charged. Taubes examines the diseases of modern Western civilization (tooth decay, coronary heart disease, diabetes, obesity, hypertension, cancer, and Alzheimer's) and finds one common, unifying causal thread: sugar. Taubes looks at the historical evidence: the frequency of these diseases is correlated with a dramatic increase in sugar consumption, and similar evidence is found when examining non-Western societies where the Western diet is suddenly introduced: rates of diabetes, obesity, etc. sky-rocket. Granted correlation does not necessarily equate to causation, but Taubes's analysis of other possible causes convinced me that sugar is the most likely cause.Taubes makes his case carefully, thoughtfully, and in great detail such that, to try to produce a summary of the case in a short review would fail to do it justice, which, of course, is why Taubes had to write an entire book. Other readers will have to judge for themselves, but I found the evidence compelling.I am actually very surprised at how totally convinced I have been by The Case Against Sugar. As a vegan, I eat a lot of carbohydrates and my fair share of sugar in baked goods (though I avoid processed foods entirely). I am used to hearing the vegan diet attacked by meat-eaters and advocates of the paleo diet and others in the anti-carbohydrate camp. I feared that this book might actually be be propaganda for meat-based, high-protein diets (i.e. the Atkins diet). But The Case Against Sugar is not an anti-carbohydrate screed. Taubes provides the evidence for sugar's toxicity, and I think any reasonable, unbiased reader will have to agree that sugar is, if not guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, at the very least a strong suspect as the culprit behind the health problems of modern Western society.Taubes makes the point that the case against sugar is nearly as strong as the case against tobacco, and if you are wondering just why we don't here more condemnation of sugar (although there is some, of course), it's due in large part to a sugar lobby just as powerful as the tobacco lobby. And there will be those who have bought into the research funded by the sugar lobby (research that should be viewed with the same suspicion as research funded by oil and tobacco companies) who will attack this book. It's fair to read their attacks on Taubes and his work to give them a hearing, but consider where the attacks come from, but then simply look at the evidence. The strength of this book and its argument is not in Taubes's rhetorical style (though that is good) but in the evidence itself. The evidence is compelling: sugar is killing us, and killing us via very unpleasant diseases.The Case Against Sugar is one of the best popular science books I've read in years. It's book that is making me re-think my dietary choices. I know that I can radically change my diet (as I did over a decade ago when I became a vegan), and on the basis of what I've learned in this book, I plan to radically reduce my sugar intake and maybe even to try to cut out sugar entirely.The Case Against Sugar is one of the most important books I have ever read for obvious reasons: there is a killer among us, and it is wreaking havoc on our bodies and our health care system (and, consequently, on our economy). That killer is sugar. Taubes has proven his case quite convincingly."
83,1524709077,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40493849-hai-nguyen,5,"Wow! I'm so glad to have read this book. Definitely one of the book will change my life. Long story short, just stop or cut down your sugar consumption to as little as possible."
84,1524709077,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7244962-dasha,5,"Really well researched and argued, explaining the complexities of government and medical community inability to provide difinitively statements about the possible toxic effects of consuming sugar. I appreciated this work and his contribution, increasing the amount of information available on this issue to help people make better educated decisions about the consumption of a product that is highly suspicious as a major contributor if not the cause of diabetes, obesity, dementia, hypertension, and possibly various cancers. I hope others get an opportunity to read this book (despite it being dense with information and subsequently a bit dry) and take a moment to consider if they need to make some drastic lifestyle changes in regards to what they put into their bodies, regardless of whatever choice makes the most sense for them. Simply having more information is key to this entire issue, and information that is not necessarily biased by corporate influence and lobbying. I would strongly recommend this book for its content and possible ramifications to our personal and global health. Regardless of what choice you make about the validity of this argument, adjusting our food intake will inevitably have positive downstream effects, as mentioned later on in the book. Strong work!"
85,1524709077,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19598288-hoang-trang,4,"Funny enough, I was first aware of the effects of sugar and refined carbs on our body in an undergrad math course, when I studied the differential equations that describe the interactions between glucose, insulin, and several other hormones. That simple model is enough to make me understand why I experience sugar high and crash, why I would crave for more sugar the more I consume it, and why it takes diabete type 2 patients a longer time to get back to a normal blood sugar level after an injection of glucose. (The last point, sadly, became relevant as my dad was diagnosed with diabete type 2 not long after that). Since that class, I've tried to consume sugar in moderation so as to keep my blood sugar level stablized. I had a vague idea that if I abuse my body too much and make my insulin level rise and fall like a roller coaster, one day it would simply refuse to work.Overtime I became more interested in diet and fitness. Strangely, the most common advice I've seen is ""cut down on sugar if you want to lose body fat"". It turns out eating fat doesn't make one fat. The mechanism of how fat is gained and lost builds the foundation of the keto diet. I also learned more about it in another book called ""The Secret Life of Fat"". Basically, our body always optimizes its usage of food intake, and goes directly to glucose for energy, store the rest in the liver as glycogen. If you want to burn fat, you first have to deplete this storage of glucose in the liver, only by consuming very little carb.The message of this book? Avoid sugar like plague!!! It not only confirms all of what I've known about sugar, but also accuses sugar as the primary trigger of a host of Western diseases, including obesity, diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, gout, and so on. The author denies any other dietary triggers that have been previously assumed as such fat and salt, by arguing that insulin resistance is the cause of these diseases, which is caused by excessive sugar in our diet. But how much is too much? As he suggests, probably nothing at all. Admittedly, I have a sweet tooth and I'm far from following a strict no-added-sugar diet. But even without my lack of self control, the difficulty of pursuing such a diet comes from two sources. First, despite being the most unnatural ingredient, sugar is ubiquitous beyond imagination. I had no idea that one cigarette contains 20gr of sugar! Even if I actively count my sugar intake, high chances are I still underestimate the actual number.Second, the impact of sugar may take decades to manifest, and when still young and reasonably healthy, we tend to overlook any potential harmful effects simply because we don't see them yet. The evidence against sugar is not definite, while there are many conflicting opinions on the best diets. It's easy to follow what is more consistent with our habits, or what is easier to get started and maintain. Cutting all desserts and bread and pasta does not at all seem easy."

87,1524709077,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9050343-kelly-x1f49c,4,"4 stars for content and information. Have to be honest though... I wouldn't have finished this book if I hadn't been listening to the audio while multi-tasking. 
The Case Against Sugar
 seems to be the seminal book on the history of people consuming sugar and how horrible it is for us.I decided to read this book in January 2018 while on a round of 
The Whole30: The 30-Day Guide to Total Health and Food Freedom
. Sugar is one of the food omitted during the 30 day round and it's a tough one. Sugar cravings are real. So I figured this book would be a good companion, and boy was I right.I heard about this book from author Gretchen Rubin and her Happier podcast. In Gretchen Rubin's book about habits, 
Better Than Before: Mastering the Habits of Our Everyday Lives
, Rubin gives the example of being an Abstainer or Moderator. Our society seems to support the idea of moderation... but for many people (myself included), abstaining from sugar completely is the best answer.From 
The Case Against Sugar
:“Trying to consume sugar in moderation, however it’s defined, in such a world is likely to be no more successful for some of us than trying to smoke cigarettes in moderation—just a few cigarettes a day, rather than a pack. Whether or not we can avoid any meaningful chronic effects by doing so, we may not be capable of managing our habits, or managing our habits might become the dominant theme in our lives (just as rationing sweets for our children can seem to be a dominant theme in parenting). Some of us certainly find it easier to consume no sugar than to consume a little—no dessert at all, rather than a spoonful or two before pushing the plate to the side. If sugar consumption may be a slippery slope, then advocating moderation is not a meaningful concept.” This book got very much into the history of the production and consumption of sugar. There is lots of detail and many sources cited. So it did take some focus and time to listen. As I said before, I probably would have lost interest and marked this as DNF. But listening to audio always helps me get books done. It's a very important subject and definitely has me questioning my own sugar consumption on a daily basis.Thanks to San Diego County Library for the digital audio via OverDrive.[Audio: 11 hours, 38 minutes]"
88,1524709077,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68285722-patrick-nolan,4,"I liked this book a lot. It gave a great foundation for understanding sugar in our culture. It stuck to research, history and science and did not sugarcoat the facts. (He he). I found myself looking beyond the book for more and I believe that was what it set out to accomplish. "
89,1524709077,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12038703-aneliya-petrunova,4,"""The Case Against sugar"" is Gary Taubes' third book on nutrition and health. It has been long awaited and, given how well written and well researched his two previous books were (""Good Calories, Bad Calories"" and ""Why We Get Fat""), my expectations were really high. Having read ""The Case Against Sкgar"", I can say I am not disappointed, although I was certainly looking forward to something slightly different. I had expected the book to be yet another summary of the evidence against sugar - an overview of countless studies, showing that sugar is THE ABSOLUTELY WORST THING YOU COULD PUT IN YOUR MOUTH. Well, it does contain this kind of information too, but it's actually a lot more than that. This book goes back in time to look at how mankind began consuming sugar, how sugar consumption increased and how sugar was ultimately declared ""generally recognized as safe"", although there is ample evidence that points to it being the root cause of pretty much all Western diseases, including metabolic syndrome and everything it entails (obesity, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, kidney disease), Alzheimer's disease, cancer, gout... you name it. The powers that be were simply too strong, sugar was simply too profitable, so the attention shifted towards saturated fat, cholesterol and calories in, calories out, while sugar was exonerated and came to be regarded merely as ""empty calories"", but far from being the beast it actually is.The book is quite valuable in that it contains sections on several diseases of civilization that are probably caused by it and/or by metabolic syndrome/insulin resistance: gout, hypertension, Alzheimer's disease, cancer.Once again Gary Taubes has done a great job. But what does he tell us with his book and why did he write it? All in all, more studies need to be done and hopefully, now that Gary Taubes has founded NUSI (Nutrition Science Initiative), they rather sooner than later will be. But the message is clear: the evidence that is already available, and there is quite a lot of it, shows that sugar is highly dangerous - definitely ""pure, white and deadly"", as John Yudkin phrased it. Stay away from it as much as you can."
