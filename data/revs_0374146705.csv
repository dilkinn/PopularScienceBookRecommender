Quite a few of the essays, such as the titular piece, were compelling, informative, thought provoking compositions. However, in what felt like an attempt to produce a book that had “Something for everyone!”, the author proved himself to be a jack of all trades, but a master of none; much of the content was unfortunately superficial, unsystematic, and ultimately a bit disappointing. Still, plenty of these articles are worth looking at, so if you don’t mind sifting through a fair amount of unexceptional material, you’ll be rewarded with some rather intriguing gems."

Until recently SOCK THEORY was the ruling paradigm. It was thought that Theodor Kaluza and Oscar Klein deduced the existence of at least one additional dimension from well known tendency of socks to disappear and then re-appear in unlikely places. How else to explain the mysterious behaviour of hosiery? Latterly a new paradigm, STRING THEORY, has superseded sock theory. Leave a length of string or anything long, thin and flexible lying undisturbed for even a day and you will find it has somehow got itself tied into knots. This can only be explained if we assume at least one additional dimension. String theory also gave birth to QUANTUM FIELD THEORY. The rest of this review can be found elsewhere."
2,0374146705,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4086118-michael,5,"A delightful set of 24 standard essays and 14 brief ones (a page or so) on the history of physics and math and current views on their relations. The essays highlight issues with Einstein’s theory of relativity (special and general), quantum mechanics, group theory, infinity and the infinitesimal, Turing’s theory of computability, Goedel’s incompleteness theorems, prime numbers and the Riemann zeta conjecture, category theory, topology, fractals, and the theory of truth. There are no equations, so we have to count on him to convey major discoveries and conflicting interpretations in words alone without distorting the truth. From a modest experience with the subject (a college course on quantum mechanics long ago and reads in recent years of popularizations by real physicists), I feel comfortable with Holt’s knowledge and competence as a science journalist. He achieved his goal of covering a lot of subjects on various themes: My ideal is the cocktail-party chat: getting across a profound idea in brisk and amusing way to an interested friend by stripping it down to its essence …The goal is to enlighten the newcomer while providing a novel twist that will please the expert. And never to bore.Successfully conveying the human aspects for all these figures is another skill that helped spur me onward. As a tiny example, the Nobel Prize winning physicist John Wheeler wondered is anyone made a theoretical connection between Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle and Goedel’s incompleteness theorem, so he knocked on Goedel’s door at Princeton’s Institute for Advanced Study. Goedel, huddled over a space heater, promptly threw him out.Often there is a tragic element in the lives of the figures. Many of us are aware of Alan Turing’s sad state after WW2 due to the 2014 film, “The Imitation Game”, with his contributions to code-breaking kept secret, his persecution by “chemical castration” for being gay, and eventual suicide by poison apple. Holt tries to rectify the film’s inaccurate portrayal of him a “as a humorless and timorous nerd.” Here are a few more examples of nutters among the brilliant:The creator of the theory of infinity, Georg Cantor, was a kabbalistic mystic who died in an insane asylum. Ada Lovelace, the cult goddess of cyber feminism … was plagued by nervous crises brought on by her obsession with atoning for the incestuous excesses of her father, Lord Byron. …Kurt Goedel, the greatest of all modern logicians, starved himself to death out of the paranoic belief that there was a universal conspiracy to poison him. Holt takes a strange excursion with novelist David Foster Wallace’s 300-page exposition (“Everything and More”) on Cantor’s 19th century accomplishment in using set theory to prove some infinities and bigger than others, in effect creating a whole tower of infinities. Holt finds he succeeded in his goal of improving on “certain recent pop books that give such shallow and reductive accounts of Cantor’s proofs …the math is distorted and its beauty obscured” and “if he was sometimes in over his head, it is because he chose to wade through the deepest waters”. In contrast to Wallace’s admiration, Wittgenstein found that:There is nothing awesome about the theory; it does not describe a world of timeless, transcendent, scarcely conceivable entities; it is really no more than a collection (finite) tricks of reasoning. One might imagine, Wittgenstein said, the theory of infinite sets was “created by a satirist as a kind of parody of mathematics”. …As a description of Cantor’s work on infinity, it is surely unjust. As a description of Wallace’s, it might be taken as a tribute.Basically, Holt trusts the average man to appreciate major problems in physics. So many mathematicians wax poetic about the connection between beauty of their theorems and equations and truth. A new kind of Platonism is alive and well among many of the wizards, i.e. a belief that mathematicians are not inventing their formulas but are discovering timeless truths beyond space and time. However, for Holt: The problem with this Platonist view of mathematics … is that it makes mathematical knowledge a miracle. If the objects of mathematics exist apart from us, living in a Platonic heaven that transcends the physical world of space and time, then how does the human mind “get in touch” with them and learn about their properties and relations? Do mathematicians have ESP? The trouble with Platonism, as the philosopher Hilary Putnam has observed, “is that it seems flatly incompatible with the simple fact that we think with our brains, and not with immaterial souls.”.Not all mathematical proofs are elegant. In the case of the “Four Color Problem”, the proof that any map of geometrical elements can be colored with four colors without any adjacent regions getting a common color took over 700 pages of arguments and a zillion computer calculations of all the permutations. Conversely, beautiful elegant equations can lead one astray. In the case of string theory, we have a brilliant mathematical system based on vibrating membranes in nine dimensions which aims to unify the major laws of physics. It has captured the imagination and life efforts of many theoretical physicists for three decades. Because of the inaccessible six extra dimensions, experimental tests of the theory have not been possible. Moreover:In a space of more than three dimensions, there would be no stable planetary orbits. (This was proved over a century ago by Paul Ehrenfest). Nor would there be stable orbits for electrons within atoms. Therefore, there could be no chemistry, and hence no chemically-based life forms, in a world of more than three spatial dimensions. …So it should not come as a surprise that we find ourselves living in a three-dimensional world. (Physicists call this “anthropic” reasoning). …And we can surely sympathize with the aspiration of Mr. Square [a 2-D character in “Flatland”]—not to mention assorted Theosophists, Platonists, and cubists—to rise up into the splendor of the fourth dimension and beyond. But we need not follow them. For intellectual richness and aesthetic variety, a world of three dimensions is world enough.I also learned some more about Einstein’s long struggle to pin down what was wrong with the standard model of quantum mechanics. Instead, of simply objecting to it on the basis of core uncertainties in reality (“God does not play dice with the universe”), he made a significant contribution in revealing it to violate the fundamental principle of locality, which posits “that the world consists of separately existing physical objects and that these objects can directly affect one another only if they come into contact” or “through causal intermediaries that bridge the distance between them.” His collaborative thought experiment known as EPR in 1927 proposed an electron in a box which then gets partitioned and the two halves moved far apart; according to the standard theory, opening one box to detect the electron, collapsing the probability wave, is predicted to instantaneously to cause the other box to be empty, a “spooky action at a distance” he took as evidence of the theory’s insufficiency. Unfortunately for Einstein’s stubborn resistence, John Stewart Bell much later designed a variant of EPR involving paired photons which allowed experimental testing. So called quantum entanglement between particles was indeed proven to involve “spooky action at a distance” according to at least three replication Thus, we must accommodate a new conception of space and the possibilities of some kind of “holistic” principle.One chapter that was especially entertaining has Holt running around and asking notable physicists how the universe and humanity will end. Recent changes in cosmology have shaken people up. For a long time the Big Bang and movement of galaxies away from each other was predicted to be slowed by gravitational attraction, perhaps leading to a Big Crunch and another cycle. I empathize with little Alvy in Woodie Allen’s “Annie Hall”, who was much distressed with an expanding universe, despite reassurances of his psychiatrist and mother that things are safe for zillions of years and Brooklyn shows no signs of expanding. Now with unknown “dark energy” causing everything to accelerate away from each other, we are back to the idea of a “heat death”, where all matter is scattered and degraded to a virtual nothing (unless dark energy runs out of steam). Most physicists don’t really worry how all will end, while others project we will overcome the problems such as adapting ourselves to energy forms in a dust cloud or by building quantum tunneling devices to move us to another universe. In my case, I appreciate Holt’s use of the anthropic principle and a Copernician assumption of humans as not so special and likely in the Bell curve of the normal distribution to predict a duration of humankind as at most a few millions of years, in line with other mammalian species.All in all a fun read and I think accessible to most general readers."

5,0374146705,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5109654-marks54,4,"This is a new book of essays/columns/short pieces by an accomplished writer about philosophy. The core essays make it clear that Holt is focusing on the philosophy of science, although the collection is rounded out to include several short reviews, as well as work on the philosophy of language and naming and even the philosophy of BS. I am never quite sure what to think of writings like this. To start with, the philosophy of science is not science. If you have any doubts, go read one of Einstein’s classic papers and see what it is like. A related point is that these essays are not really serious philosophy either. Philosophy is difficult and frequently very focused. It is also fun to work through - but it does need to be worked through. Go read some of Hilary Putnam’s essays to see.So what are these essays? They are entertaining and readable. They also help to clarify some ideas that many have heard of but few know in detail. Einstein and quantum physics for sure, including String Theory. The coverage of Godel’s work and even Heisenberg and his uncertainty principle do a great service for general readers and point out numerous works to follow-up with if one is more interested and wishes to read more. I realized a long time ago that labor markets generally work and that big time philosophy was not in my future. But I have also loved reading philosophy and reading about philosophers and their work. For most people, a guide will be needed. Jim Holt does a fine job in this capacity. The essays are also well written and funny.Philosophers are also academics and some of the essays touch on the dynamics of academic life featuring significant philosophy. I wish Holt had included more of this. The place of women in the occupation has not been without controversy in recent years and I found the ending piece on Kripke especially interesting. There have been other examples especially in the #metoo era, but the piece Holt includes is exceptional in showing how discussions about ideas and their lineage fit into broader academic dynamics."

There's a lot to love about this book and a few things that kind of grated at my nerves. But overall, some of the better chapters were incredible and really made me think and want to do more research. Despite some potentially serious flaws, I'm giving this one four stars for getting me excited enough to start digging out more of my math books again."

Review
Math and philosophy have always been two sides of the same coin to me. One uses numbers and symbols to build logical arguments, and the other uses words as its tools. While the goals look different, they are actually very similar. Both disciplines seek to explain the beauty of the world they observe around them, and let’s face it, popular culture views the practitioners of both as intelligent ascetic scholars locked in their academic towers living lives wholly of the mind writing and creating papers for other scholars. But there exists certain scholars who wish to bridge the gap between those inside and outside the academic disciplines. When Einstein Walked with Gödel: Excursions to the Edge of Thought by Jim Holt from Farrar, Straus, & Giroux seeks to bring a philosopher’s gaze to the discipline of mathematics, and he largely succeeds. This collection of previously published essays paints a picture of a careful writer wrestling with the mathematician’s place in history. Mr. Holt writes with authority over a wide range of ideas, and he’s found the right balance of challenging and accessibility. When Einstein Walked with Gödel is an excellent addition to my growing list of scientific, mathematical, and philosophical publications; recommended for anyone who wants a survey of the deep ideas in those fields.
Walking with Big Ideas
From infinity to string theory to Mandelbrot to the Riemann Zeta conjecture, Mr. Holt covers the big ideas of mathematics. The essays approach these ideas from a descriptive rather than technical standpoint, and many have a historical and biographical focus that place the mathematical concept in time. To organize the book, essays are grouped into nine sections. Part eight consists of shorter, quicker essays that are unique to this book. Overall, the book covers a lot of ground but doesn’t just skim. Mr. Holt dives into the ideas to produce thorough and enlightening work.
Writing
Receiving an Advanced Reader Copy (ARC) of When Einstein Walked with Gödel made me ridiculously happy. It hits two of my favorite areas of reading, philosophy and math, but it does so in a pragmatic way. When I pick up scientific/philosophy books, I’m looking for the middle ground of being understandable without being condescending or written with too much hand-holding. Collections like this should be – as it says in the description – accessible. What does accessible mean, though? To me, an accessible scholarly work means that a deep knowledge is not necessary, but the text still requires intellectual interaction. When Einstein Walked with Gödel hits this sweet spot of shining light on tough ideas while not being out of my intellectual capabilities. Mr. Holt accomplishes this through a mix of translating academic ideas from math to practical descriptions, biography, history, and book reviews. It’s clear that Mr. Holt does exhaustive research for his articles and thinks deeply about each topic. With any scientific work, the writing determines the success of the book, and Mr. Holt’s writing is excellent, challenging, and precise. In nearly every essay, Mr. Holt slips easily into a very high diction that had me running to the dictionary; he loved slipping in $100 words or haughty phrases. These moments felt self-congratulatory and knocked me out of the essay but each occurrence was momentary. 
The Problem with Collections
As this is a collection of essays and not one whole work, each section provides a new topic, a new argument. Like any collection, some work better than others. The titular essay and ""Truth and Reference: A Philosophical Feud"" stood out as the two best. The three essays dealing with the mathematical concept of infinity, and, in particular, ""The Dangerous Idea of the Infinitesimal,"" shifted my perspective on the slippery concept in an entertaining way. Mr. Holt’s shorter essays mostly succeeded as more philosophical sketches than essays. Though I think of them more as intellectual snacks when compared to the full meals that are his essays, these short pieces will make you think, or, at least, say “aha.” Overall, When Einstein Walked with Gödel avoids the problem with collection by being filled with many strong pieces. While there were a few weaker essays, only one stood out as a real negative.
Poor Ada Lovelace
In the ""The Ada Perplex"", Jim Holt questions whether Byron’s daughter deserves the historical position that she occupies, and the well-researched essay casts doubt on her position. But I can’t help notice that the reasons used by Mr. Holt align with historical methods of erasing the contributions of women. Hell, just the cover of Joanna Russ’s How to Suppress Women’s Writing lists examples of the arguments that Mr. Holt used to show that Ada may not deserve her vaunted place. Even upon finishing the whole collection, I still don’t know what to make of the Ada Lovelace essay because her contributions are debated but not erased. While this essay attempts to walk the thin line between shedding light on a necessary debate and controversy, I don’t think it succeeds. Her collaboration with Babbage should be scrutinized, but she shouldn’t be discounted as a contributor. Mr. Holt, clearly, researched the hell out of this topic, and if he found obvious evidence for his conclusion, it wasn’t effectively argued in his essay. In the later essay ""Truth and Reference: A Philosophical Feud,"" Mr. Holt succeeds in clearly laying out a controversy without erasing Ruth Barcan Marcus’s contributions, which shows he possesses the capability to write about a difficult topic without erasure. It could be that the second essay succeeds where the first doesn’t because of historical distance between the two events. I just wish he’d handled Ada’s case with a little more care.
Gödel
Gödel and his incompleteness theorem pop up frequently throughout this collection. Whether a byproduct of research, personal bias, or just being right there on his mind, Mr. Holt slips Kurt Gödel into many of the essays. While noticeable, the reference never feels forced. Much the same way a physicist drops Einstein or Feynman into conversation, Mr. Holt name-checks Gödel. All of these references indicate where Mr. Holt places the Austrian in the pantheon of great mathematicians. Simply because of Mr. Holt’s his intellectual rigor and repeated usage of Gödel throughout the collection, he made me curious to learn more about the mathematician and his incompleteness theorem, which is currently beyond my grasp, not that I’ve spent much time on it. However, this is one of the things I enjoyed about the book because it places Mr. Holt in an intellectual lineage. Before this collection, I knew little of Kurt Gödel other than he had an important theorem. Now, I owe Mr. Holt a debt for piquing my curiosity about this strange genius. 
Conclusion
When Einstein Walked with Gödel: Excursions to the Edge of Thought exceeded my expectations all around. While some essays missed and one failed, overall the collection presents an enticing, in-depth look at big ideas, maybe some of the biggest ideas in human intellectual history. This accessible yet challenging book educated me on every page without boring me. The very best essays stuck with me long after I finished reading them, and I realized it was because Jim Holt had taken exceedingly complex ideas and distilled them down to their essences. In When Einstein Walked with Gödel: Excursions to the Edge of Thought, Jim Holt translated academic beauty into the layperson’s splendor.8 out of 10"
8,0374146705,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17458466-matthew-harris,3,"I don't normally write a comment regarding the star rating I've attributed to a book, but in this case I feel I should qualify my rating.For the most part the content of this book is of great quality. Had it not been for the tedious set of shorter essays towards the end and the condescending tone I feel the author occasionally exudes this would've been a 5 star rating.But its not 4 stars either... and that is due to the utterly unfortunate choice Jim Holt made to focus almost entirely on the ""excursions to the edge of thought"" that occur in a mans brain. Seriously, how in the fucking world can you overlook the rest of the population and their contribution to the wealth of human knowledge? Of the core essays from the book (focusing on quite a broad range of subjects from the arts, technology, philosophy and science) just a single one has at its core a woman. And that essay is basically a tear down of Ada Lovelace and her contribution to computing. I'm not debating the veracity of the arguments Holt presents (although, I did detect a bit more of a bite in his writing here compared to elsewhere), I just think its a shame that rather than try to redress the balance a bit, he instead picks just a single female and seeks (solely) to undermine her achievements.Interestingly, I didn't think I'd heard of Jim Holt prior to this book. But, while researching him, I found I had in fact come across him before: https://www.independent.co.uk/life-st... Quite a nasty pattern, eh?"
9,0374146705,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4277032-d,2,"I agree with this review. Worse, I did not manage to finish the book since the quality/interest went rapidly down hill in the second half. The first story on the relationship between Einstein and Godel is not uninteresting but lots more detail can be found in this book which contains an account of his wife's life. A minor quip on the hilarious Boganov scandal: Wikipedia confirms that the bogus articles were not about string theory as the author mistakenly claims, probably because there was a stray reference to an article by a string theorist in the bibliography. By the time another section started explaining for the second time the unimpressive 'Copernican' principle, I had enough and put the book aside. All in all, a disappointment."
10,0374146705,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75671-gerald,2,Most of this is Holt not Einstein or GodelOnly the introduction describes how the two great men walked together at Princeton. The rest of the chapters are the author's simplified explanations of his understanding of the latest thinking in relativity and mathematics. He asserts Godel said time does not exist but doesn't explain the notion well. Time need not be a factor in Einstein's equations. But that doesn't mean it isn't a consequence of being in a particular frame of reference. Otherwise rocket scientists wouldn't be able to reach their targets!
11,0374146705,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47112679-joseph-carrabis,2,"I wrote a review of this book. Now it’s missing. Holt would turn that fact into a chapter on any number of topics.Not quite popsci, not quite personal philosophical explorations, not deep enough for research, too deep for most readers’ pleasure reading. Holt slides over some material and delves into others. Not sure what his selection algorithm is. Am sure he’d write a chapter about it. Or use it as a leaping place to some other topic."
12,0374146705,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1971718-b-rule,3,"A collection of essays on interesting topics that unfortunately is less than the sum of its parts. Holt is an engaging writer with a rock-solid knowledge of mathematical and philosophical topics, and he wrote one of the best books I've read in a long time (""Why Does the World Exist?""), but this one falls far short of that lofty exemplar even though it covers many of the same topics. The main problem is that this collects essays that appeared in other publications over a period of many, many years (at least one clearly dates back to the mid-90's, and receives an outpouring of footnotes in a hasty attempt to bring it up to date). Further, those essays often overlap in topic. So, while they may stand well alone, in succession they become repetitive, belabored, and also sometimes inconsistent. A thinker praised in one essay may turn up as the target of a hit piece later in the volume. The reader is often introduced to a physicist or mathematician and then receives another introduction afresh later in the book, which wastes pages and feels a bit absent-minded at best. Further, a lot of these lack the depth of Holt's book-length excursions on the questions of existential import. That magazine quality occasionally reveals something of the threadbare in Holt's argumentation: in his haste to find an ""angle"", there are a lot more straw men set up, pompous declarations on the soundness of arguments without the legwork to show it, and general pettiness on display. I'd still rather read Holt than the vast majority of authors out there, but I was disappointed in this. It felt more like a cash-in due to the popularity of his earlier book rather than something that urgently needed to be published. There were definitely parts I liked though. I enjoyed his essay about Dawkins, for instance. Although I know Holt to be an agnostic with some antipathy towards organized religion, I thought he did a good job of showing the weaknesses in Dawkins' case against theism (even though I'm guessing Holt agrees with Dawkins more than he differs). The best pieces are often the ones with an inside baseball exploration of professional conflicts that most of us would never hear about, but which deal with topics of supreme interest to all of us (e.g., the ultimate fate of the universe, string theory and/or the theory of everything, the nature of truth, etc.)."
13,0374146705,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59796109-tracy-rowan,4,"I read a lot of audiobooks about science. I don't always understand everything I hear, but the format does make that easier for me. Holt's collection of essays on science and (to a lesser degree) philosophy range from the easily comprehensible to the sort of things that would make my eyes glaze over if I was reading hard copy, but for the most part he does a great job of making a lot of complex scientific ideas much clearer and more accessible.His discussions of physics and mathematics, which make up the bulk of the book, made a good deal of sense to me as I listened. Not that I could reproduce the formulae or equations involved. But Holt manages to give a layperson the ability to grasp some difficult concepts with the clarity of his prose.And then there's the philosophy part which sometimes utterly eludes me because so much of it is counter-intuitive.  Still, it's almost as interesting to hear about the battles over who took credit for what, even if I don't begin to understand the What part, as it is to get the lowdown on Einstein's problems with ""spooky action at a distance"" which name could have been applied to gravity before science became aware of how forces work, or Gödel's paranoia that people were trying to poison him, leading him to effectively starve himself to death. Certainly some of the most interesting parts were Holt's discussion of the life and work of Alan Turing, who these days seems to be more famous as a gay martyr than as a brilliant mathematician who, in breaking the Enigma code, helped win WWII.It's one of those books that veers from the chatty and informative to the murkily complex. Some of it is a joy to read, some went the proverbial route of in one ear and out the other. Still, I feel as if I got a great deal of both pleasure and information out of it, and I think that's all I can reasonably expect."

Check out this unusual question. What is likely to happen with laughter and numbers at the year one million? Thrilling. And it gets better. Remember that the intercourse between mathematics and physics has been pushing human intelligence to its limits. The essays on mathematics invite you to: digest infinities with different sizes, touch infinite small numbers and jump in places with many dimensions. In sequence, come computers creating very long proofs together with the decision problem which is equivalent to the halting problem. Followed by physics searching for a theory of everything that may help us to explore the energy of our sun so civilization can spread over the galaxy. And much more. But no bullshit.

Topics and people discussed definitely added to my reading list."
17,0374146705,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85723871-thomas-dietert,5,"In this impressive collection of essays, Jim Holt will surely stroke your intellectual curiosities again and again as you make your way through a swath of well-crafted, succinct, and insightful essays on topics ranging over Physics, Mathematics, Philosophy, Logic, Psychology, and Sociology, all pleasantly framed within a context characterizing the slew of intriguing intellectual progress made and confounding conceptions presented in the 20th and 21st centuries by a number of thinkers.Holt proves without a shadow of a doubt his writing abilities and understandings of such a variety of subjects that it is hard to fault him too greatly whenever one essay or another falls short. The long-form essays ranging from 5-20 pages provide, most of the time, the perfect amount of introduction to a subject, the necessary context from which to interpret the relevant ideas, a quick peek into the meat of the topic, and a brief conclusion to summarize the ideas presented. Perhaps the least compelling section of the book was the collection of short essays that repeatedly left me wanting, but still yet provided me with a knowledge tidbit for taste, exposing me to ideas ever-so-briefly before leaving it all on the table with a brief conclusion. I would recommend this book to anyone whom you would consider an ""aspiring contemporary intellectual"", as the sheer breadth of the domain covered by the variety of essays contained within does not force a particular field of thought as it's main subject. Anyone and everyone who enjoys learning would benefit from reading these essays intentionally, as Holt does a wonderful job portraying such complex ideas as the Riemann-Zeta conjecture, the apparent non-locality that emerges from quantum physics, Godel's incompleteness theorem, whether or not the internet has made us more productive, and the nuanced way in which one should interpret the word ""bullshit"". I rated this book 5 stars because, although on average I might rate each essay 4 stars, the impressive composition of such a collection is a feat and display of intellect in itself. I have never read a book that spans so many topics in such breadth, affording most subjects their necessary depth (as much as can be done in an essay), all the while maintaining a narrative that seems to guide the reader from one essay to the next. I thoroughly enjoyed reading most every essay contained within, and the ones that didn't astound me at least left me with a cornucopia of food for thought with which I will be repeatedly satiated for the forseeable future.

However in this case I have two reasons to rationalize my failure. The first reason comes from Holt himself. He explicitly states a couple of times and then later more coyly alludes to his observation that folks who take thinking to “the edge of thought” don’t seem to fare that well. He cites cases of paranoia, isolation, suicide, and madness among many who thought to the edge. OK, you don’t have to tell me twice (well, yes you do); I don't understand what I read but failing to do so is actually good for my health - got it.Many of the essays present information in such a way that I ended up doubting I knew anything to begin with. Pythagoras didn’t come up with the Pythagorean Theorem? Charity is bad? Rocks have consciousness? Did I already go over the edge of thought? That leads me to the second way to rationalize away my relative stupidity: Holt's final essay in this collection deals with bullsh1t. I can’t help thinking now that maybe, just maybe, Holt was bullsh1tting me all along! I don't understand it, it is detrimental to my health, and it's all bullsh1t. Sounds like 4 stars to me!"
19,0374146705,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8325737-philipp,4,"A collection of book reviews and essays, mostly from NYRB I think - in structure these are very similar to Freeman Dyson's collections of essays, i.e., there's a book to be reviewed, but the book's themes are used as a starting point for an essay about the themes, not a evaluation of the book itself.The themes of the essays sometimes overlap, but Holt is much more interested in the philosophy of mathematics, i.e., what's more fun to think about, the infinity of numbers between 1 and 2, or the infinity of large numbers? There's a history of the 'solve' of the four-colour-theorem and the associated problems (it was essentially brute forced with computers, which angered many, which is what the essay is about!)There's a needlessly mean essay about Ada Lovelace in there (the gist: she was a kind of Paris Hilton who couldn't even do basic maths, it was all Babbage), but the rest is gold.Favorite quote, from a review of David Foster Wallace's history of infinity:And if he was sometimes in over his head, it is because he chose to wade through the deepest waters.Other quotes:De Prony found his inspiration in Adam Smith’s Wealth of Nations—specifically, in Smith’s account of the division of labor in a pin factory. Hiring a hundred or so Parisian hairdressers who had been thrown out of work when their clients lost their pompadoured heads to guillotines during the Reign of Terror, de Prony set up a kind of arithmetic assembly line that would, as he put it, “manufacture logarithms as one manufactures pins.” The individual hairdressers had no special mathematical abilities: all they could do was add, subtract, and cut hair. The intelligence was in their organization.This surprised me a lot; there has been a lot of hype about Liu Cixin's The Three-Body Problem, in which there's a very similar machine using soldiers as 'pins'. Amazing that this existed in reality!On the eternity of the universe:Why should we want the universe to last forever, anyway? Look—either the universe has a purpose or it doesn’t. If it doesn’t, then it is absurd. If it does have a purpose, then there are two possibilities: either this purpose is eventually achieved, or it is never achieved. If it is never achieved, then the universe is futile. But if it is eventually achieved, then any further existence of the universe is pointless. So, no matter how you slice it, an eternal universe is either (a) absurd, (b) futile, or (c) eventually pointless.Channeling Discworld's Death in Hogfather:As long as there are no decisive arguments for or against the existence of God, a certain number of smart people will go on believing in him, just as smart people reflexively believe in other things for which they have no knockdown philosophical arguments, like free will, or objective values, or the existence of other minds.If all of these soundbites sound boring to you, steer clear, it's mostly like that!"
20,0374146705,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7426118-chris,4,"A book of essays about a combination of math theory, physics, and philosophy, the author does well tying together a disparate set of thoughts. If you enjoy all three topics, I highly recommend this book. If you enjoy or are interested in one or two of the topics, you will probably enjoy reading those essays and skipping essays that interest you less. This lover of physics and philosophy (but not math theory) wishes he had skipped some of the essays on math theory (but not all; the essay on infinity kept me very engaged). Even if you don't agree with the author's conclusions, the writing is clear and thought provoking, and sometimes even a bit playful (e.g., comparing Richard Dawkins' The God Delusion to a Michael Moore movie with ""good, hard-hitting stuff . . . but the tone is smug and the logic occasionally sloppy""). Beyond that, the author manages to discuss some highly complex subjects without devolving into jargon or unreadability. Certainly worth a read for the topic areas that interest you."

Each of the eight main sections of the book begins with a review of moments of great progress in a scientific field, followed by an associated essay on the topic. None of this is original research, and any fan of mathematics and science will have already been through much of it. But repetition is the heart of education, and this should be among the books we fans read. Part I: The Meaning of Time and the Provability of MathematicsTwo early 20th century discoveries unsettled the Newtonian view of absolutes. The first was Albert Einstein’s Theories of Relativity that destroyed the Newtonian view that time and space are absolutes. His Special Relativity (1905) proved that both time and space are measured differently for bodies traveling at constant relative velocities: one observer seeing another speed by in a spaceship will see time on that spaceship as moving slower, see that spaceship’s mass as larger and its length as shorter than if it were at relative rest. Einstein’s General Relativity (1916) extended his Relativity theory to include relative acceleration between bodies traveling in space, thus explaining gravity as the result of warped space surrounding objects with mass , and rejecting the Newtonian explanation of “attractive force.” The second was Kurt Gödel’s Incompleteness Theorem (1931) that destroyed the notion of logic and mathematics as internally consistent frameworks through which all true propositions could be proved; no longer could mathematicians claim a consistent axiomatic foundation for their work. The theorem proved that no axiomatic and recursive system of logic (like mathematics) can be both consistent and complete—there will always remain true statements that cannot be proved. (note: “axiomatic” means derived from a set of assumptions or first principles; “recursive” means that propositions derived from the logical system can refer to themselves; “consistent” means that the axioms do not contradict one another; and “complete” means that all true propositions derivable from the logic can be proved within the logical system. .Part II: Neuroscience, Numbers and Statistics The key character here is John Galton, Charles Darwin’s first cousin and the mid-19th century father of statistics. Galton spent his life measuring things and keeping records. Galton believed that genius ran in families (after all, he was Darwin’s cousin). He set out to prove this by tracing family trees, recording the connections, and assessing the intellects of the members. He developed the concepts of correlation and regression to summarize the results. Thus began the “Nature vs. Nurture” debate. It seems clear now that genius does run in families: among Nobel Prize winners in Economics there are remarkable connections (Paul Samuelson and Kenneth Arrow are cousins—proof of Nature? But Paul Samuelson and James Tobin, though not related—went to the same high school—proof of Nurture?)Galton’s bad rap is because he went beyond statistics and founded the field of Eugenics, arguing that society should attempt to encourage growth of families with desirable traits and discourage growth of other families. He did not endorse euthanasia or sterilization for racial breeding, nor would he have supported Hitler’s form of racism. Part III: The Mathematics of FractalsThe key figure is Benoit Mandelbrot, a brilliant mathematician who was sufficiently strange that he never had a tenured academic position until he was 85 and tenured at Yale. His career was spent at IBM back when big corporations had think tanks, though he meandered in and out of the academy.Mandelbrot was a visual thinker interested in the shapes that nature took on. He created the concept of self similarity—that if you take any irregular shape like the coastline of Britain, or the edge of a leaf, and break it into smaller pieces, you will see that the shapes of those smaller pieces are highly similar to the entire coastline or leaf. From this he developed a mathematics to describe and measure self-similar shapes. That mathematics, called Fractal Geometry, became the rage. One curious thing about fractals is that nature can be described in partial dimensions—instead of three spatial dimensions there might be 3½. Ouch!Fractals were found everywhere: In economics Mandelbrot found that the time series of commodity and stock prices followed a fractal pattern; in hydrology it was used to explain the mergence of unusually high tides or of floods. It appeared that nature followed fractal geometry. Part IV: The Matter of DimensionsThis section is essentially an entertaining riff, a bit of entertaining fluff that eases our path. Two topics are covered here. The first is the number of dimensions in the universe: is it three, as Newtonians believed? Is it four, as Einstein believed? Is it 9-11, or 26, as modern string theorists argue? Or is it one or two, as Edwin Abbott wrote in his popular 1877 satire Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions? If it is more than four, where are they? If it is less than four, when are we?The “Four-Color Conjecture” is also discussed. This is a long-standing conjecture that four is the minimum number of colors required to differentiate segments of any map displaying irregular abutting shapes, as in a map of the United States whether it is by state or by county. No matter how many such “maps” you play with, the minimum number of colors always comes up four. But this isn’t mathematical proof of the conjecture—maybe a map you didn’t draw requires only three colors! So the emphasis is on a correct mathematical proof. You’ll be surprised that no mathematical proof has been found; perhaps this is this an example of Gödel’s Incompleteness Theorem. At any rate, so far the best “proof” we have is the result of massive number crunching by computers, a technique considered abhorrent to mathematicians.Part V: Infinity and the infinitesimalThe “number” ∞ has a long history. The question, “What is the largest natural number?” has been debated for centuries. Galileo noted that the number of squares of a natural number was always equal to the number of natural numbers, so if there are N natural numbers there are also N values of the squares of those numbers. From this he concluded that there is no end to the natural numbers—if 1 2 3 4 5 are your natural numbers, then 1 4 9 16 and 25 are the associated squares and the natural number 25 is larger than 5. And if you then choose 25 as the largest natural number the same argument tells you that the larger number 625 also exists. Using this leap-frogging method Galileo concluded that for every natural number there is a larger natural number. Clever, huh?In the 19th century Georg Cantor, a Polish mathematician, set out to prove that there was no limit to the natural numbers using an axiomatic foundation, i.e. a mathematical method. Cantor’s journey through the infinite resulted in some serious innovations, not least being his creation of “set theory,” a mathematical theory addressing collections of things. Cantor not only proved that there was no limit to the natural numbers but also that there were several different types of infinity—in fact, he found that there is an infinite number if infinite sets.For example, there is the set of countably infinite numbers (the natural numbers), and there is the set of uncountably infinite numbers (the real numbers). The distinction between them is that there are an infinite number of rational and irrational numbers between any two natural numbers. The countably infinite set has fewer infinite numbers, so we get the strange result that there are “small” and “large” infinite-number sets. Just as the notion of the infinite was considered an abomination by the Greeks, so was the idea of the infinitesimally small—how could anything be invisibly small yet have substance? To introduce this, Holt quotes Jonathan Swift;So, naturalists observe, a flea / Hath smaller fleas that on him prey; / And these have smaller fleas to bite ‘em, / and so proceed ad infinitum.This matter was put to rest in the 17th century by the independent and virtually simultaneous creation of calculus by Isaac Newton and Gottfried von Leibniz, both of whom contested the other’s contribution and each of whom felt some discomfort at accepting the infinitesimal. Newton divined the measurement of motion and the paths of the planets using calculus. I would argue that calculus was the single most important development in mathematics, at least as far as practical applications are concerned.u>Part VI: Computation and ComputabilityAugusta Ada Lovelace, Lord Byron’s daughter and wife of the Count of Lovelace, was an eminent figure of the early 1800s. Byron abandoned the family in Ada’s first year and her mother decided to expunge any notions of poetry from Ada’s future. To do this she attempted to turn Ada toward mathematics. Ada never got it, and her greatest contribution was her allegiance to Charles Babbage’s Analytical Machine, the first “computer.” The machine was an awkward mechanical device that was always in progress, never completed, but much admired. In this association Ada was the chief advocate and, by report, the first coder (Holt rejects this, noting that the Analytical Engine was never built.)In reality, Ada, like her father, was unstable, addicted to opium and gambling, and promiscuous. She also was a legend in her own mind, thinking herself to be a genius bound for fame. This led her into strange endeavors like “mapping the nervous system,” an early effort at neuroscience. She died at age 36, her father’s age at death. She left little of value except a reputation based, I suspect, on her gender. The Defense Department uses a programming language called ADA; nobody uses BABBAGE.Serious computation-by-machine began with Alan Turing, the first real computer scientist, who built the Colossus (also called “The Bombe”) at Bletchley Park to decode the German Enigma code. Turing committed suicide in a most Socratic way: he is reported to have eaten an apple laced with cyanide in 1954. The widely believed reason is that he was gay—a crime in Great Britain; he had been outed and tried two years earlier. But Holt notes that the apple was never tested, and that a coroner’s verdict of suicide was a forgone conclusion, not a reasoned verdict. Possibly, Holt suggests, the suicide in 1954 was related to the 1951 discovery of a cell of Soviet agents placed at high levels of British academia. Was Turing in this group? Introducing this query is a bit like watching the History Channel.: “Is it possible that . . .?”Turing’s primary interest was in the ""Decision Problem,” also called the “Halting Problem.” Could a machine be constructed that would use an axiomatic foundation to prove statements in logic and mathematics? This interest seems strange in light of Gödel’s Incompleteness Theorem (see above) but Holt doesn’t raise this matter. Turing went to the U. S. before the war and received a Princeton PhD; during the war, while attached to Bletchley Park, he was sent to Bell Labs for a year (yet another corporate-sponsored think tank) where he began working on the concept of the General Purpose Computer we see today.Turing also was interested in the boundary between humans and machines, in particular, how to determine if a machine was “intelligent.” His answer became the Turing Test: if a human and a machine communicated by Telex across a barrier preventing visual identification, and the human believed from the conversation that the party on the other side is also human, the machine would be deemed “intelligent.” The Turing Test has been a central part of cocktail party conversation ever since.Turing never built a general-purpose computer, but a team headed by the over-the-top-brilliant John von Neumann did. In 1950 the Mathematical And Numerical Integrator And Calculator (MANIAC) lit up at Princeton’s Institute of Advanced Studies: the digital computer age had arrived. Von Neumann had worked on the atomic bomb at Los Alamos (he was an expert on shock waves—and on everything else) and the first use of MANIAC was in the design of the hydrogen bomb.Von Neumann’s talent went well beyond blowing things up. He also made a significant contribution to economics with his 1944 Game Theory and the Theory of Economics, co-authored with Oskar Morgenstern. This single-handedly created new ideas for economists and others interested in the interactions between economic agents uncertain about the responses of other agents to their decisions. Parts VII-VIII: The Cosmos and CosmologyThe Standard Model of physics lists the elementary particles and their characteristics, and integrates three of the four universal “forces:” electromagnetism (radiation), the strong force (holding atoms together) and the weak force (radioactive decay). Born in the 1950s, the Standard Model has been modified over time to resolve some internal conflicts and to incorporate the discovery of new subatomic particles, the latest being the long-sought Higgs Boson that imparts mass to particles. It is the best model of the physical world available, but it has one very glaring problem: it does not yet incorporate the gravitational force that tells us up from down. The advent of String Theory in the 1970s was hoped to bring a theory of quantum gravity that knit quantum mechanics with gravity and with subatomic particles. This hasn’t happened. String theory replaces the point-like particles that we think of with one-dimensional strings, each vibrating in space-time Strings can be open (like a laundry line) or closed (like an O-ring). Open strings connect “branes,” each brane being a clump of vibrating strings stuck together in a multidimensional object like a thick carpet. The closed strings exist between branes and create “particles” in local areas between branes. Several string theories have developed, each requiring a number of dimensions higher than the four we experience: the total number of dimensions is as large as 26 (Bosonic String Theory) and as small as 9. Among the research topics for string theorists is how to integrate these theories and agree on the number of dimensions. In 1995 Edward Witten, an eminent physicist, argued that the five string theories at that time can be unified if there are “only” eleven dimensions. He set off a rush to integrate the different theories and construct a single string theory. It appears that some work on integration has paid off—Hold refers to nine required dimensions.OK. Enuff! An interesting book that you’ve probably read before but with a different author.4.22 Stars."

Also, while he does a decent job of historic neutrality, I feel like he might have had his thumb on the scale a bit during the essay about Ada Lovelace. Otherwise, though, it was exactly what I expected and wanted.

35,0374146705,http://goodreads.com/user/show/826429-sj-loria,4,"A good book, if a bit redundant in the stories and characters he discusses.Reading Jim Holt is cool if you are interested in eternity, infinity, and the philosophy of science. (Author scans room, sees people leaving rapidly). Recently I’ve been bugging out on two concepts this book digs into: time and numbers. Time, the eternal mystery, the illusion we seem to glide through. Numbers, a system of tools that if applied to humans has disastrous consequences. Let’s take a look at both.TimeTime doesn’t exist in the way our mind presents it. And so, the deepest philosophers, from St. Augustine to Einstein (yes, I consider Einstein a philosopher) have contemplated it with great interest. Time is relative, our experience of it is linear, but using cognition we can get beyond that into the realm of the Eternal. It’s like a secret book few are interested in reading.NumbersMost people don’t understand the difference between cost (a number) and value (a qualitative result). A simple, pragmatic way to live is to focus on costs and things that can be measured. But there are two underlying flaws with the everything is numbers (Pythagorus) or if it can’t be measured it can’t be managed (Ducker) approach to life.First, there is no such thing as a complete logical system, even in mathematics. It was Einstein’s amigo, the wonderfully eccentric Kurt Godel, who proved this using the logic of mathematics. Second, there is a tremendous danger in considering everything as numbers. People, for instance, cannot and should not be quantified. You are not your FICO score, a person in China is not their 3 digit social point system score, even tapping on stars for a person after they perform a service is a troubling trend. The origins of big data slash data science in eugenics shows how careful we have to be on this front. In essence, if you believe that all people are created equal, you are making a statement that data suggests is totally wrong. Quotes[Gödel’s] conclusion – that no logical system can capture all the truths of mathematics – is known as the first incompleteness theorem. Godel also proved that no logical system for mathematics could, by its own devices, be shown to be free from inconsistency, a result known as the second incompleteness theorem. 9Godel had shown that mathematics has a robust reality that transcends any system of logic. But logic, he was convinced, is not the only route to knowledge of this reality; we also have something like an extrasensory perception of it, which he calls “mathematical intuition.” 10What Einstein had shown was that there is no universal “now.” In place of the fleeting present, we are left with a frozen timescape – a four-dimensional “block universe.” Over here, you are being born; over there, you are celebrating the turn of the millennium; and over yonder, you’ve been dead for a while. Nothing is “flowing” from one event to another. Einstein, through his theory of relativity, furnished a scientific justification for a philosophical view of time that goes back to Spinoza, to St. Augustin, even to Parmenides – one that has been dubbed externalism. Time, according to this view, belongs to the realm of appearance, not reality. The only objective way to see the universe is as God sees it: sub specie aeternitatis [under the aspect of eternity]. 17* [The way numbers are written and stated impacts your ability to do mathematics] Today, Arabic numerals are in use pretty much around the world, while the words with which we name numbers naturally differ from language to language. As Dehane and others have noted, these differences are far from trivial. English is cumbersome. There are special words for numbers from 11 to 19 and for the decades 20 to 90. This makes counting a challenge for English-speaking children…French is just as bad…Chinese, by contrast, is simplicity itself; its number syntax perfectly mirrors the base-ten form of Arabic numerals, with a minimum of terms. Consequently, the average Chinese four-year-old can count up to forty, whereas American children of the same age struggle to get to fifteen. And the advantages extend to adults. Because Chinese number words are so brief – they take less than a quarter of a second to say, on average, compared with a third of a second for English – the average Chinese speaker has a memory span of nine digits, versus seven digits for English speakers. Speakers of the marvelously efficient Cantonese dialect, common in Hong Kong, can juggle ten digits in active memory. 33In the new age of genetic engineering, it is becoming apparent that the eugenic temptation has not gone away at all; it is simply taking a new form, one that may prove harder to resist. 52[The bell curve, applied to eugenics] Why is the bell curve so ubiquitous? Mathematics yields the answer. It is guaranteed to arise whenever some variable (like human height) is determined by lots of little causes (genes, diet, health, and so on) operating more or less independently. For Quetelet, the bell curve represented accidental deviations from a sort of Platonic ideal he called l’homme money – the average man. When Galton stumbled upon Quetelet’s work, however, he exultantly saw the bell curve in a new light: what it described were not accidents to be overlooked but differences that reveal the variability on which evolution depends. 56To God, there is no zero. I still exist. And so, one feels, does the infinitesimal. 166* Psychologists distinguish two broad types of intelligence. “Fluid” intelligence is one’s ability to solve abstract problems, like logic puzzles. “Crystalized” intelligence is one’s store of information about the world, including learned shortcuts for making inferences about it. As one might guess, fluid intelligence tends to decline with age, while the crystallized variety tends to increase, up to a point…The net is making us smarter only if we define intelligence by the net’s own standards [rapid retrieval of information]. If we take a broader and more traditional view of intelligence – if we think about the depth of our thought rather than just its speed – we have come to a different and considerably darker conclusion. Why is the ‘buzzing’ brain of the computer user inferor to the ‘calm mind’ of the book reader? Because, Carr submits, a buzzing brain is an overloaded one. 208The best explanation of quantum mechanics in five words or fewer: Don’t look: waves. Look: particles. 234"
36,0374146705,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20051503-kunal-sen,4,"It is a fascinating read, covering a wide range of topics from Mathematics to Physics to Philosophy, but all in a language that all of us can understand. However, he is careful not to oversimplify things, which often happens in popular science writing, where the information gets vague, useless, and even misleading. The book will make you think, and perhaps push you to know more about these topics.The book is a celebration of the highest intellectual achievements of the human race, or at least that's what it claims in the description. However, in reality it is a collection of essays, perhaps written at different times. As a result the collection seemed a little nonuniform to me, both is theme and tone. They are all brilliantly written, but they don't always form a single whole. If we are celebrating the peak achievements of human intellect then Darwin certainly has a place there, but not Dawkins (though I love his books), and even if Dawkins finds a place then it should not be one of his lesser books (The God Delusion) that should be the focus. In terms of tone, while some essays are written with a non-partisan tone, others are strongly opinionated."

Sure you can call a collection of essays a book, but when the essays overlap and have lots of duplication - rehashing some of the same things and people? Well, that makes it less like a book in my book. Another disappointment was that I'd hoped it would really do a good job of explaining hard to understand math and physics concepts in lay terms. If you're reading this with hopes of really understanding those things then think again. Despite those disappointments, some of the essays are genuinely fascinating. And shed light on interesting concepts. And dash some notions that one thought of as true. Overall though, this isn't the book I expected it to be and I'd not recommend it as a cover to cover read."

The only accurate part of the title was the part that said ‘Excursions to the Edge of Thought’. That it was. In more ways than one. Although, the most interesting excursions my mind took resulted in thoughts like, “Why would the author write a book titled ‘When Einstein Walked with Godel’ and then cease to mention those figures after the first few pages?” “Did the author intend to start writing about Einstein and Godel and then lose his train of thought?” “Did he suddenly realize that he didn’t have any information about the interplay between those two figures and , like an epiphany, decide he would plug in a random collection of essays in its place.” “Maybe no one will notice”, he thought. I’m sorry if I’m ranting, but inconsistency bothers me. And I don’t mean to be unfair to the author. I was actually expecting a book about the discussions Einstein and Godel had while both were at Princeton. That’s the part that piqued my interest. I thought, “That sounds interesting!” I was expecting a work discussing the musings of Einstein and Godel, specifically between each other on mathematics and physics. Instead, what I got was a set of essays of a more philosophical nature on the topics of mathematics and physics. Very well…..I can play along. I can go for philosophical discussions as well.I suppose my favorite chapters were those on on string theory and the birth of the computer. To begin with, string theory could be said to hold promise except for the fact that in positing a valid theory, you should eventually be able to come up with some evidence to support it. String theory lacks this. There’s nothing wrong with coming up with theories. It’s how science has advanced to where it is today. Einstein theorized long before his statements were proven to be true. However, when such a long period of time passes with no new work developed to support it, you have to wonder if it should be scrapped. At this point, are the scientists ardently defending a soon-to-be valid proof, or just clinging to an unsupportable faith?  It appears quantum physics has started to track with that of our post-modern culture—-coming up with theories on culture and politics that make no sense. I understand that statement will get some people’s hackles up. But I had to laugh when I read the part about the two physicists who left the camp of string theory. In the face of the modern theorists, having not come up with even one mathematical formula in the past 40 years to support it, these two had decided they’d had enough. Smolin and Woit are their names. One famously made his statement about the theory as being ‘not even wrong’. I don’t care what the idea is that you’re trying to promote; that is the ultimate smack-down of a statement. It would suggest that if you’re trying to establish the validity of a new theory, you’re on some pretty shaky ground. I could only laugh. I sometimes wonder if physicists and mathematicians are missing one very important concept, which is that things often work in theory, but fall apart in practical application. Like an M. C. Escher drawing, it appears to make sense when you look at it, but when you try to figure out how it would work in your mind you can’t. Escher’s Penrose stairs come to mind. That’s because in this example, you’re trying to convey a three-dimensional concept on a two-dimensional space. It simply won’t work.Some other interesting information was brought up on the origins of the computer. These were interesting to read, along with other intriguing topics. I wouldn’t say this book isn’t worth reading. However, given its digression from the title, I would say to just be prepared to be taken on some off-topic trails. Apparently, nothing is what it seems."

I think E=mc2, too!But since then, there are electrons, we can prove it, but there are smaller things, then we get to quantum mechanics, particles that are linked together like after you crash electrons against each other in the CERN supercollider (if small particles exit such a collision they remain forever twins in some version of quantum mechanics thought), String Theory, Einstein's boxes--an experiment of thought that he used to [not] prove an idea about String theory, and although he died in 1955, he was by no means on the cutting edge of String Theory; there are a lot of other guys now, a Higgs boson particle, but I digress. There are neutrinos (or not) that would take 250,000 of them to weigh out to one electron.There is no unified theory that both describes gravity, as Einstein's does by correlating mass to the speed of light, but also describes quarks, and some other words I forgot that are smaller than electrons (neutrinos). Everything may just be made up of small strings.Now, we have the CERN supercollider in the EU, which hopes to do things like describe the relationship between matter and antimatter (good luck with that), and the nature of dark matter.Here's your main take-away from all of this Physics though. There are ""local"" phenomenon, OR, or, there are distant, non-local phenomenon: spooky actions!Ah ha ha ha ha ha. That's right! Einstein said, all this string theory, and Schrödinger's cat, or Einstein's boxes. That's where you have an electron in a box. Then what if you slid a box divider down the middle--now you know the electron is in there, but you only can describe its pattern, now the box is split in half, you know its route, its wave, its trajectory, but you have to take off the lid to know it's precise location right now. Well what if you take one half the box and put it on a boat to Tokyo, and the other half on a plane to Paris. When you open one of the box in Paris, does the other box now have the particle because you didn't find it in Tokyo? When did it stop, when you looked at it? Like Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, anything you examine is no longer that which you seek to study, you changed it by looking at it.All this crazy shit, Einstein said was nonlocal phenomenon. Or, spukhafte Fernwirkung!And THAT'S why you should read this book. Because you MUST know what the fuck spukhafte Fernwirkungen are (pardon I put in the plural in case there are more than one)! Translate: distant, spooky things. Like opening a box in Paris, and change the contents of a box in Tokyo, that is some distant spooky shit right there. Either the particle went back in time and changed location when you opened the box, or its twin particle...whatever.Read the CERN, super-collider page if you know anything about Physics. I know I messed up the explanation of this stuff. But man it was funny.Would recommend to David Henson, and other friends. Because the ancient Greek philosophers, Ethics, Eudaimonia, shit like that, I know David has a degree in Philosophy; it'll gas him.In the meantime, my friends...we are made of stars of course, but can we pinpoint these electrons of which we are made? Are is there some spukhafte Fernwirkung going on here!? I want to know!(Americans please pronounce ""shpook-haff-tuh fairn-veer-kung"" as often as possible. If you say it into a mirror three times, with your eyes closed, your hair will puff up like Einstein's. Aaaahhhh!)"
41,0374146705,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12749187-greg-nigh,4,"I will start by getting a bit of irritation out of my system.The title of a work of fiction has no particular obligation to convey what the book is about. It might reveal itself several chapters into the work as even a single phrase uttered by a protagonist, with no bearing on the overall story.The title of a work of nonfiction, on the other hand, carries some responsibility. It should encapsulate, if only as a simple courtesy, the subject of the book. Following the standardized format of ""Main Title: Subtitle,"" the two let us know if that's our topic of interest.When Einstein Walked with Godel: Excursions to the Edge of Thought by Jim Holt, violates this unwritten contract with his potential readers. I purchased it because I am fascinated by the intensity of Godel's intellect. A case could be made that he had few rivals in the 20th century, and not many prior to that either. I wanted to learn more about what these two talked about on those afternoon walks home from their offices at Princeton. The book's title suggests it reveals something about that.It doesn't.This 344 page book had finished with its discussion of the scientific affinity between these two by page 14. Holt is not privy to those particular conversations, and even in those 14 pages, Holt's treatment is largely a gloss. In spite of all that, he's written a very decent book in its own right.This book is, chapter by chapter, a fairly captivating review of the characters who came up with the most compelling ideas within the realms of mathematics and related fields in the 20th century: Cantor's genius in discovering that there are an infinite number of infinities  Dehaene's discovery that our brains have a sense of numbers that is independent of our sense of language, memory, and reasoning. How did evolution come up with such a thing?  The brilliant and tragic life of Alan Turing, who gave us the modern computer, and we gave him in return an early death for his homosexuality via either suicide or murder, a case closed but still mysterious.  A chapter is devoted to string theory, giving it less credence than it wants and more than I think it deserves. It is a theory with nothing to show for itself except the production of mathematical tools that have been useful in other realms. Call that a triumph, but after billions in public funding of the project, at least admit that it's a lame ass triumph.  As infinity exists on the big end, the infinitesimal exists on the small end. Or does it? Is there such a thing as infinite division? Holt brings in Godel, Abraham Robinson, Pascal and a bevy of others to explore this fascinating, limiting idea. Don't read this book if you have a fascination with Godel and Einstein. You won't get much about that. Read this book if you are intrigued by genius, if you marvel at how ideas come to be and subsequently shape our culture in subtle ways, or if you are intrigued by the characters who came up with the most radical scientific ideas of our era."
42,0374146705,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3030419-fraser-kinnear,4,"10/1This is a collection of essays all written independent of each other over the span of what appears to be several decades. Many are book reviews, some are responses to big news stories in science and mathematics, a few are just interesting thought pieces. As a result, there is a lot of overlap, and you'll read Holt recalling the same references and anecdotes again and again.Also, because these are all short essays, you're never given enough detail to really understand the subject matter - which is a problem, because it's all pretty heady stuff. I've struggled through whole books about subjects that Holt attempts to dispatch in the span of a few sentences (Reimann's hypothesis, Cantor's disagonal argument, Godel's incompleteness theorem, the usurpation of Formalism & Logical Positivism, Einstein's general relativity, the Copenhagen interpretation of Quantum Mechanics, string theory, regression to the mean, the Platonist vs Aristotelean ontology of mathematics, etc).This book is, however, really super fun as a survey of interesting things to travel down wikipedia / youtube holes for, after a brief primmer from Holt. Here's a laundry list of new things I learned about:-Boltzmann brains-Godel's rotating universe-Neuroscience has shown that ""We have a sense of number that is [cognitively] independent of language, memory, and reasoning in general"" which is mostly used for counting small numbers of things, and is innate (not learned)- reform math- Speakers whose first language is Chinese on average can remember 2 more digits (9 total) than English speakers, because Chinese numbers are faster to say and therefore easier to store in active memory- The Copernican principle, and it's application to predicting the lifespan of anything. This has an interesting resonance to Conservative political philosophy- The Langlands program- Group theory and its applications in physics - Category theory- Zipf's law as a power law distribution commonly found in language- Abraham Robinson's contribution to our understanding of infinitesimals- Conservation law and it's relationship with symmetry- Newcomb's paradox, which was back in the news because of Elon, Grimes, and Rocco's Basilisk- Saul Kripke's controbution to logic and the controversy that he plagiarized Ruth Barcan Marcus for the new theory of reference"
43,0374146705,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6751318-naessens,2,"This book is a selection of essays about ideas, concepts in the fields of mathematics and theoretical physics, and the people behind them. Contrary to its title, few of them actually deal with Einstein or Gödel.As a result, I have a very mixed opinion after finishing this book. I liked some of the essays, but I found others not as detailed, dull or even totally uninteresting. Moreover, as one progresses in the books, there are repetitions.The essays that I really liked, because they explained well great ideas and/or because they told in an engaging way the lives of people behind them are : ""When Einstein walked with Gödel"", ""Numbers guy, the neuroscience of math"" (about how numbers are represented in our brains and the influence of cultural factors), ""Benoit Mandelbrot and the discovery of Fractals"", ""Geometrical Creatures"" (based on Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions which in my opinion should be read by all pupils in secondary school/junior high), ""A comedy of colors"" (about the 4-colour conjecture and its proof thanks to a computer), the three essays about Ada Lovelace, Alan Turing and John von Neumann, ""The Looking-glass War"" (about the symmetry of mirrors), ""Newcomb's Problem and The Paradox of Choice"".I really liked how Jim Holt restores the truth about the real contributions of Ada Lovelace and Alan Turing to computing, even if Ada's was not as important as I believed.However, starting from part VII the book slips into more and more esoteric stuff and less and less precise mathematical information. It concludes in part IX with rambling about the existence of God, what it takes/is to be a saint, or telling the truth. I really felt this last part was far-fetched and out of context.I guess every reader may find essays that will either interest him or bore him. There were essays that I really liked and deserved a 3 star-rating but the rest was only worth 1 or 2 stars. Hence, my final rating is 2 stars but 2,5/5 would be more fair."
44,0374146705,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59314015-alex-rokowski,4,"Jim Holt presents a collection of essays on mathematics and philosophy ranging from nature of time, to the concept of infinity, to the rise of modern statistical thinking and the rise of computers. He tends to frame the discussion of each of these subjects around the historical figures who advanced the thinking on each subject.For the layman, of which I include myself on a number of these subjects, this book is an accessible and thought-provoking discussion of or introduction to these topics.One of my favorite essays includes a fascinating exploration of the concepts of the infinite and infinitesimal. The author posits that the idea of the infinitesimal, the infinitely small, has presented more challenges to mathematical thinking than the infinite. Consider the classic Zeno Paradox, a form of reductio ad absurdum argument, which proposes that it’s impossible to walk the distance between two points because first you’d have to walk half the distance ad infinitum. The result is that that you’d never be able to traverse the entirety of the distance. This kind of idea has presented plenty of controversy to the realm of mathematical and philosophical thought and is the kind of thought experiment that mathematicians and philosophers have used to advance their respective areas of work.Mr. Holt also attempts to answer other questions that are relevant in contemporary debates such as who was the first computer programmer or was Alan Turing's death a suicide or was he murdered? Ada Lovelace, considered by many to be the first computer programmer, he contends, is not despite her work on Charles Babbage’s Analytical Engine in the 1850’s which was a precursor tool to subsequent computer engines. Alan Turing, the father of computer science theory and artificial intelligence, died under suspicious circumstances after eating a cyanide-laced apple just a short while after being chemically castrated for homosexual activities in the 1950s. This, despite his critical contributions to cracking German ciphers in World War II as depicted in the 2014 film “The Imitation Game”. Just two examples of questions the author waxes poetic about.In terms of historical other figures the book touches on, I learned much on a number of people that I previously had little exposure to. For example, Francis Galton, a distant cousin of Charles Darwin, whose analysis of the distribution of heights within a population gave rise to the concepts of regression analysis and correlation which pervades numerous fields, not the least of which is seen in the realm of financial theory today. Less known though perhaps is that he was also the father of eugenics or the idea that human characteristics can be promoted or controlled through selective breeding. These ideas caught on and became mainstream with the rise of Nazism just a handful of years later.Also interesting was a discussion of some ideas that remained unsolved in modern mathematics. For example, the Riemann hypothesis, which is our best guess at the theory behind the distribution of prime numbers, has remained unsolved for over 150 years. The current prize for solving it is over $1 million. Altogether, I highly enjoyed this book. In full disclosure, I listened to the audiobook version and therefore have no highlighted quotes to show. At a little over 15 hours, this one will keep you busy for a while in a heady sort of way."
45,0374146705,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5917740-nilesh,4,"The book is a collection of essays. Or rather, it is a collection of three collections of essays. The Math collection is excellent. The physics one is prosaic. The philosophy is indulgent and whimsical.The book lacks a common theme despite the author’s best attempt to connect all his musings to two of the greatest minds. The excursions are stand-alone discussions, which is not necessarily negative. Almost all the discussions are newspaper article length, and as a result, many of them suffer from inadequate treatment. This is more an issue once the Math related discussions get over around the half-way point.In fact, the math essays are amazing. The way the articles are written with a smattering of tales involving the key persons behind the issues, the article length and a quick jaunt to definitive conclusions all help to create a series of great articles on different math topics. The same characteristics turn into a liability once the commentaries move to certain parts of quantum physics and relativity. The discussions contain little new for anyone who has read about the topics and/or their inventors in any popular books. It turns much worse when the author briefly expounds on a highly specific branch of philosophy. The sections appear incongruous with everything else in the book and are most difficult to understand even as standalone articles.Overall, a five-star book if one ends reading it once the Math sections are over."
46,0374146705,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8967389-isaac,4,"This book is a collection of essays, grouped by a theme. Most of the essays are a mix of micro-biographies, and histories/descriptions of big complex science topics which were, for the most part, made accessible enough for a regular person like me to follow.Jim Holt is a strong essayist. Beyond distillation of incredibly complex ideas, he does it in succinct little pieces which always weaves in a human interest and structures everything with a clever arc or thread to the narrative that turns back on itself or gets tied up neatly with a witty flourish. He also has a rich vocabulary and sent me running for dictionary.com more often than have had to in a long time.I learned about this book from seeing Jim Holt on a bloggingheads.tv, and based on that conversation I expected the book to lean more into math and Platonism which is how the first 1/3 of the book played out, but just when I was starting to lose interest in those topics it shifted over to some fresh topics, some of which (programming and the computer age, the cosmos) were my favorites in the book. Then, bout 2/3 through the book, there is a section of shorter essays which was also a lot of fun.Those short essays should have been at the end though, because Holt returns to the longer format for the final section and it felt a little jarring to me.This was a super fun read though, anyone who wants a fairly accessible survey of many spacey high-level science concepts would really enjoy it."
47,0374146705,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51581864-wendelle,0,"This collection sports essays that may be more erudite than the common popular science book, and more capable of explaining and simplifying the bare bones of famous mathematical topics. However, I still find a couple of problems with this book: a)its chapters rely on the template of starring a ""Great Individual"" of mathematics and essentially sharing that person's biography, rather than shifting the focus of essays towards mathematical fields or concepts, thus ignoring the contributions of non-superstar mathematicians and neglecting the incremental architecture of the mathematical edifice; b) the author has a habit of insidiously baking perilously questionable opinions into these standard essays about famous mathematicians-- namely, he asserts proudly, without proof, that math will be diminished by the Year Million of our species into a disposable activity that plays a game out of proving tautologies, and will be regarded as secondary to the importance of humor. He also asserts that Sir Francis Galton, the father of eugenics, should be restudied in a more favorable light: ""Galton's goal, to breed the barbarism out of humanity, was not despicable."" Apropos to that, I would actually say a lot of people would find the conception of breeding humanity towards some narrow-minded purpose controversial and more worthy of discussion than offhand lines in an essay"
48,0374146705,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18626891-mht,3,"Some chapters were good, some were weird, and some were just boring. I think the global maxima of my confusion was in the chapter about Alan Turing, in which the author spends a great deal of time downright trash talking other authors and points out flaws in their writing about Turing, instead of writing himself. Shockingly, I'm not too interested in how other books get a subject wrong when I'm not reading the books in question. A good second place for my confusion is the Ada Lovelace chapter, in which the author tries his best to discredit Lovelace by saying, and this is me paraphrasing, that «we'd be just as good without her, and that George Boole did most of the important work anyways; Ada was just a rich maniac, and by the way she wasn't even good at math».Towards the end the book is mostly about philosophy (I should have guessed this based on the title of the book, really), which is not really my cup of tea, so it's difficult to say if the chapters and topics discussed actually are interesting to some. Personally, I've heard that one needs to be bored in order to be creative: this was certainly confirmed while reading this book, as I got plenty of new ideas while struggling through the final three chapters."
49,0374146705,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19902817-sam-ritchie,3,"I thought that this book would be so up my alley; I've been on a reading kick of modern math and mathematical history, and what better clickbait than a picture of two studs, Einstein and Gödel, walking around Princeton?Not much about these essays stuck in my mind. The themes of the book were interesting, but the interleaving of very light mathematical detail with stories of the personalities involved just did not mix into anything gripping.I'd recommend skipping this and picking up either of the two Quanta Magazine books:The Prime Number Conspiracy: The Biggest Ideas in Math from Quanta, orAlice and Bob Meet the Wall of Fire: The Biggest Ideas in Science from Quanta."
50,0374146705,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7258380-dan-graser,4,"Overall, this large work on some of the more abstract notions in mathematics, physics, and philosophy is a pleasure mainly due to Jim Holt's ability to deal with such dense subjects with wit and clarity. That being said, there isn't a great deal of depth here and where I was hoping for more in-depth biography we mainly get anecdotery. Given the essay style of the work that now seems inevitable but given the title, I was hoping for a bit more, at the very least, on the two main figures listed. However that is a minor criticism since the writing remains very engaging and I have no doubt your imagination and interest will stay firing for most of the work. Of particular note are the final two sections dubbed, ""Quick Studies,"" which are shorter articles/essays on a variety of topics and the humorous final section, ""God, Sainthood, Truth, and Bullshit."" All in all, a nice survey of the 20th - 21st centuries' most interesting and difficult concepts told very enthusiastically and wittily while remaining true to the complexity of each issue. "

I am assuming that he took the title from the walks that Einstein and Godel would take together back when they were both at Princeton.It discusses many different ideas, from Time and the notions of its passing to Thermodynamics and the End of the Universe as we know it. In the preface, we find the considerations that Jim Holt took when including an essay in this collection.I really enjoyed this book, it covers a lot of ground and doesn’t really have a focus except for stuff that the author thought was cool. I agree that these are interesting and neat subjects. We find essays that explore whether or not the Internet is making us stupid, essays on cosmology and pure mathematics, essays on how computers were developed and so on."

But every piece within it at some point put a smile on my face or even made me laugh out loud. I can’t get over the John Cage joke embedded into the middle of the Einstein/Goedel essay. It was an excellent way of illustrating how time can be relative rather than absolute. Even when the subject was over my head, such as the one about Kripke, Marcus and the Theory of Direct Reference, I could appreciate the rich irony: what better way is there to discuss this theory than making it the center of a story about possible plagiarism or accusations of improper attribution? Each of the essays at its center is concerned not merely with the ideas themselves but with the people who created them. That helps a layman such as myself stay hooked from page to page."
53,0374146705,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4745646-rebekah-tozier,5,"This book was everything I hoped for and more. I am somebody who has always taken an interest in mathematics, science, and philosophy while never specifically studying these disciplines in any sort of masterful way. Therefore, I was a bit nervous when I first bought the book, thinking that the possibility that I could stagger through a few chapters before dropping the book in confusion/despair was not low. I was pleasantly surprised at how well Holt presented concepts in a way that felt graspable but never patronizing. Of course, there remain a few sections that I definitely would not have a successful conversation if I tried discussing it with any sort of authority. Overall, ""When Einstein Walked with Godel"" was engaging, witty, and thoughtfully presented complex ideas and the individuals who studied them. "
54,0374146705,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52059897-jor,5,"Excursions to the edge of thought are well researched and equally well told. Most of them also does a good job showing the reality of science world where sometimes people with very powerful thoughts, well... loose themselves somewhere at those edges? That’s what I took from the book besides all the fun science facts and stories: what is science is still highly subjective. String theory, cosmology and other fancy topics might be nothing else but a well paid form of self entertainment. That’s my interpretation, but only because I really didn’t knew when I was younget that thinking about how the universe might end is a legit profession. So I’m jealous, I am.Some of the articles lost me, because there was just too much details that I can really live without. But what’s admiring is Holt’s ability to report on all these stories. This is some proper, beautiful journalism and writing. "
55,0374146705,http://goodreads.com/user/show/688965-sean,3,"Some interesting essays, some less so. Holt is very smart, but often it feels as though he's more interested in making sure you know just how smart he is than in actually explaining anything to the reader. He's fond of quoting things in French without translation. He likes throwing in extremely unusual words, again, it seems, to make you know he knows them. It's like he's writing popular science essays, but doing so for an extremely thin slice of highly knowledgeable people. Which people, being so knowledgeable, likely wouldn't be interested in reading Holt's gloss on subjects they're well versed in. He seems to know a lot about his subject matter, and is yet unable to describe theories and ideas with much clarity, and in many cases writes about scientific and philosophical ideas and arguments as if the reader already knows their details."

In general the collection is fine and the writing clear, understandable, and for the most part free of technical jargon. Although some of the subject are arcane, the author presents them in a structure that usually draws the reader in with ease. For me, these essays were like medium soduko puzzles--a little challenging, but still accessible, and a sense of accomplishment when done. But given the wide range of topics, not all the essays were winners. Most of the math and physics pieces were enjoyable, but I found the essays dealing with medicine or biology, less than interesting. This was due more to my own personal taste than the quality of writing, but some of the essays did feel overly long. Still, I think the rating is closer to 3.5 stars and I'd recommend this to any interested non-science reader. "
57,0374146705,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36489698-r-nair,5,"The best book of technical essays for the lay reader in recent times. Every chapter flows well both in terms of prose and in terms of explanatory adroitness. The book focusses mostly on problems in Mathematics, Physics and Philosophy but also touches upon the philosophy of religion (Richard Dawkins's arguments in the God Delusion are analysed from a philosophical purview and add vastly to the readability of the book). The interviews with prominent Physicists and Philosophers coupled with the author's own opinions and humour was another charming facet that was a joy to read. A book to open on to random chapters often over the years. Highly recommended for those who enjoy good science writing."
58,0374146705,http://goodreads.com/user/show/55067283-carl-pixley,4,"Interesting but a little shallow I found this book to be mostly interesting. It consists of a number of essays on logic and philosophy that Mr. Holt had published over the years. Most of the essays are more like a review of one book or one author. The best essay is the title essay on which I learned a number of things about Goedel and a bit about Einstein. I also particularly liked the essay about Saul Kripke and controversy about his celebrated theory—which seems not to have been original with him. But it all seems to have been a tempest in a teapot but made his reputation. From my perspective, he would have made a larger impact if he had done some real mathematics rather than philosophy."

But, I still recommend reading it if you’re interested in math, physics, philosophy, pensive contemplation, and don’t have much exposure to such topics. The good: very interesting subject matter, approachable explanations, and the fact that it fills a niche that has few books available.The bad: the author lacks talent at explaining things clearly. Often, I had to cross-reference topics to Wikipedia where the explanations made better sense. Also, the author’s tone is sometimes condescending and editorializing. The discussions are superficial, and as others mention, the topics are presented almost randomly. There are also essays that I felt the author was not knowledgable enough to discuss, making me suspicious of the other essays’ veracity."

I understood about every tenth word.Having finally finished this book, I don’t know whether to think of myself as a teensy bit smarter...or see myself as dumber than I thought I was to begin with?"
280,0374146705,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32283488-lucian,5,"Jim Holt, always cheering me up: ""Why should we want the universe to last forever, anyway? Look—either the universe has a purpose or it doesn’t. If it doesn’t, then it is absurd. If it does have a purpose, then there are two possibilities: either this purpose is eventually achieved, or it is never achieved. If it is never achieved, then the universe is futile. But if it is eventually achieved, then any further existence of the universe is pointless. So, no matter how you slice it, an eternal universe is either (a) absurd, (b) futile, or (c) eventually pointless."""
281,0374146705,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7183523-ben-worsley,3,"For the most part, I really like Jim Holt’s subject matter - the philosophical questions and consequences surrounding modern physics. However, this book was not nearly as well written as his previous and the author’s pompous dismissal of various historical geniuses (David Foster Wallace was “sometimes in over his head” and Kant’s writing was “fuzzy” and “fallacious”) was off-putting as was Holt’s condescending dismissal of neo-Platonism. But then again, I don’t live in NYC, so what do I know?"
282,0374146705,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7986197-jeannine,5,"Never mind that some of the discussion was over my head, Mr. Holt's magnificent writing skills overcame my ignorance with an avalanche of rarely used but delightful words, e.g. ""jejune"", ""gnomic""and ""puny demigods"". Holt chronicles the struggles between geniuses as theories in physics, logic, and math are refined through disagreements among the giants. Actually, it's a fun read. I will happily read anything Mr. Holt writes."
283,0374146705,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69455267-samuel-m,4,"Jim Holt covers a lot of ground in this book mentioning almost all of my heroes in Science, their principles and philosophies and even some of my favorites writers and poets, Oscar Wilde, Walt Whitman, Robert Frost, and others. My only critique would be I get a weird vibe from Holt when it comes to identity language that feels rather unnecessary, specifically in regards to Alan Turing's sexuality, Ada Lovelace's gender, and others. It felt unnecessary in the grand scheme and scope of an otherwise fascinating book. I laughed out loud hearing Diogenes respond to the Zeno paradox."
284,0374146705,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12700288-paul,3,The format necessarily creates a lot of repetitions and doesn't allow for any in-depth explanations of any but the most superficial elements of the science discussed but it contains a lot of interesting observations and historical notes. It also questions some common assumptions showing alternate views and is probably the first book I ever read that doesn't propagate the now tiresome myth of Ada Lovelace. 
285,0374146705,http://goodreads.com/user/show/89346448-daniel-jones,4,"The other posted reviews encompass my impressions. I agree with the ""5"" ratings; enlightenment beyond prior exposure to esoteric topics in number theory, abstract mathematics, theoretical physics, and philosophy. I also agree with the ""3"" ratings; disappointment the content didn't deliver against its title by providing more than it did on the fascinating discussions that occurred between Einstein and Godel. Hence my ""4"" rating."
286,0374146705,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11936064-djcb,4,"Nice pop-sci focusing on physics and (pure) mathematics. (think Gödel's incompleteness Theorem, Quantum Physics, Turing machines).Not much I hadn't read elsewhere before, but overall a nice read, discussion both the science and the lives of the practitioners. A special focus on France, it seems. The writer is not afraid to point out where other writers got it wrong.Ends with a long discussion (soap opera) on who first came up with some philosophical idea did not interest me much."
287,0374146705,http://goodreads.com/user/show/912478-susan,5,"This is a sensational book! Was Alan Turing assassinated? Do minimal criminals exist? The book is a series of essays on mathematics, physics, cosmology, and (less successfully) philosophy, as well as some of the characters that, for one reason or another, stand out in their narrative over the years. The author writes in a style that is satisfying for readers with almost any level of scientific knowledge."
288,0374146705,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14221010-ej-darisse,2,"This book was not at all what I expected. There were lots of interesting insight into math and the central figures involved in the discovery/development of various concepts. There was only one chapter dedicated to Einstein’s walks with Godel. Prior to reading this book, I thought I liked math. Now I realize that I like calculations and math is, as advertised, quite boring. It turns out high level math is basically philosophy and who has the stomach for that?"
289,0374146705,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7896877-stephen,4,"Boy howdy. Decades ago I received my Bachelor's in Mathematics. This book takes me back to thinking about math: infinity (large and infinitesimal), topology, calculus, group theory, unified field and string theory, and all the men and women who thought and proved their existence. This book touched on all the topics that lured me into mathematics: it's personal, spiritual, and rife with characters. I suspect you, who don't have an affinity for mathematics, would find this fascinating. "
290,0374146705,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58101535-peter-s,3,"Some really interesting chapters, some really uninteresting chapters. The chapters do not connect (basically just a series of essays). This book is not actually about Godel or Einstein, but really just about science and math. It is very similar to a Short History of Nearly Everything by Bryson. I would recommend reading that book first as it is less granular (though neither are beyond the realm of understanding of a lay-person such as myself. "
291,0374146705,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9988962-jeremy,3,"Holt has written an excellent collection of STEM-related essays, and you want to celebrate him for writing so accessibly about math and physics, but -alas- it is still math and physics... I did get the amount of inspired information I wanted from it, and I recommend “Time: The Grand Illusion” and “Smarter, Happier, and More Productive”, both which can be found on the internet!"
292,0374146705,http://goodreads.com/user/show/84076289-jerry-smith,2,"I didn't seek out this book. Rather I walked past it in my local library and the cover/title intrigued me. Unfortunately the book has little to do with Einstein, Godel nor walking.. A collection of essays with topics ranging from Science, Mathematics and Philosophy. Many of which are very good. I can't help but feel I was the victim of a bait and switch, thus the rating."
293,0374146705,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27909161-hen,3,"Compendium of essays on interesting scientific and philosophical topics covering physics, mathematics, biology, philosophy ethics and more. Sloppy at times, makes mountains of molehills on some philosophical ideas, opaque explainations when examined in detail, but still covers a wide range of topics I've been exposed to over the years in one place."
294,0374146705,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13587881-sashank-dewan,3,"3.5/5Some of the essays are quite interesting and engrossing if you have some background knowledge beforehand. But some of the essays just drags on, with no particular objective in mind. Good for readers who are interested in physics, mathematics and philosophy, if they have some general knowledge within the respective fields."
295,0374146705,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15440454-brian-miko-ajczyk,4,Jim Holt compiles a series of essays he wrote about interesting people in science and math that made major contributions to their fields. The book is styled upon the famous friendship of Einstein and Gödel who would take walks on the Princeton campus and discuss big ideas and theories.An excellent read.
296,0374146705,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51355549-adam-z,5,"As many other reviewers have said, there is a large variation in quality among the different essays in this collection. That being said, I have found some of the essays to be so enjoyable and thought-provoking that I think they deserve a 5-star rating. Nothing prevents one from skipping the less interesting essays."
297,0374146705,http://goodreads.com/user/show/583557-sue,4,"An intriguing collection of independent essays on a selection of subjects, e.g., . the nature of time . the Riemann Zeta conjecture . the role of infinity & the infinitesimal in mathematics. string theory. Einstein & ""spooky action""etc.Holt has his own opinions, which I sometimes disagreed with, but overall I found the essays interesting, often informative, & sometimes thought-provoking."
298,0374146705,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50018180-darrel-bishop,4,"This was a fun trip through a wide variety of ideas centering around philosophy, mathematics, and physics. I came away with a better understanding of the connectedness of these disciplines and plenty of food for thought."
299,0374146705,http://goodreads.com/user/show/309661-john,4,"Some of the math got a little too high for me, but understandable and informative on the whole. Particularly enjoyed his disquisition on ""Bull,"" but he has provocative things to say about, for instance, time, space, the end of the universe, and Ada Lovelace's contributions (hint: he's not a fan)."
