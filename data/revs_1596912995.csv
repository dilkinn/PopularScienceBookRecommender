I'm not a non-fiction sort of reader (and this is non-fiction) but--as his editor at Bloomsbury mentioned--he has managed to build characters and plot into this story of the world we live in which is missing many (most) of its big predators.And who'd have thought that there might be a connection between serious issues such as missing pollinators, lyme disease, streambed erosion and dysfunctional animal behavior??"
1,1596912995,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10770371-dan,5,"Five stars! Where the Wild Things Were is a must read book on species conservation. It is a very well written and researched book. Stolzenberg’s reporting and history on numerous vanishing apex predators and resulting overpopulation of prey is balanced and measured. This is the first “science for the masses” book that I have read that, in detail, covers the effect of over abundant prey fauna (due to lack of predators) and the devastating effect on flora.There is an intriguing chapter on overabundant deer (white tail and black tail) populations and the correlated precipitous drop in flora species and birds in American forests. The deer eat virtually anything including saplings allowing noxious weeds to propagate and crowd themselves into forests. An effort to transform forests away from deer game reserves (by introducing apex predators or eliminating deer herds) is often met with swift resistance. Deer hunting enthusiasts don’t seem to understand that deer population densities of 100 deer per square mile (populations found in many forests in the midwest and northeastern US) is 5x to 10x the maximum deer density than can support healthy species diverse forests.There is a balanced chapter on Orcas, a mammal several tons in size, that eat 20% of their body weight each day. They are one of the most efficient predators on the planet and their presence in an area can have significant temporary effects on seal and sea otter populations. A part of the natural cycle, the prey are briefly eliminated from an area. I suspect because the marine eco system is not closed off, the seal and sea otter populations rebound quickly after the orcas leave for other food sources. This is often not the case when man disturbs the natural order of things. There is a chapter, a bit tongue in cheek, on introducing lions and elephants to the American southwest to parallel the the mega fauna species that roamed 10,000 to 15,000 years ago before man’s arrival. The author merely reports on this effort but does not necessarily espouse it.And of course there are several chapters on man’s impact on mega fauna from the Clovis period in the US and man’s ability to run down antelope in Africa. Interestingly it has not been so easy for man to rise above the predators. There is a discussion of the large eagle species in today’s Africa where half their diet can be monkeys. This evidence led anthropologists to connect the dots on early human remains of man that had been killed by some kind of animal. So man (most often children) for hundreds of thousands of years were often prey and regular food sources for big cats and large raptors. In summary this book is not a doomsday diatribe on species eradication, although I think these books should be read. Instead I found the message and facts here to be very compelling and in an odd way satisfying. This reporting on lack of forest and species diversity reinforced my own gut level experiences from my own travels and endless wilderness romps. This is one reason that remote backpacking deep in the wilderness is so compelling and that the lack of diversity in the forests especially near populated areas is noticeable.Stolzenberg is a very good writer who has a real knack for understanding a reader’s attention span.

Now that I've finished reading it, I am not a bit less pleased.Frankly, my good feelings about this book really got started the moment I received it in the mail, where it surprised me by arriving less than two weeks after I was notified of winning a copy. When I tore open the package and spilled the book out in my hands, I was struck at just how pretty it was. Judging by its cover, perhaps? Maybe. But I tell you it would have been warranted. The imagefile listed here doesn't do the cover justice.But, oh, the content did not disappoint at all either. Where the Wild Things Were is a fantastically interesting book, and it's written in such an engaging manner that I was pulled straight through the whole thing in a matter of days. Try not to let the descriptive chapter headings seduce you into sampling the chapters out of turn with each other, though. As excellent as the individual chapters like ""Bambie's Revenge"" and ""The Lions of Zion"" are, the information contained within the chapters builds in a very structured manner, and I really encourage that the book be read right through. Best of all, the last quarter of the book is filled with fabulous reference information, from detailed chapter notes to a healthy-sized index. The bibliography alone is gold; I cannot wait to explore some of the books listed.If I really had to drum up some sort of quibble, I might complain that the coverstock of my trade paperback copy is a little light in weight and already showing a tendency to curl, or that the interior paper could stand to be a touch better in quality, or even that the delicate black curlicues, which decorate the green strips of cover at the top and bottom edges of the book and that you cannot see at all in the imagefile, have been mildly obscured by the placement of the author's name (a slightly lower placement would have been perfect). But as quibbles, those are hardreaching and of very little merit. Contentwise, I cannot complain at all. This book is highly recommended.Also of interest is Stolzenburg's article in Conservation Magazine.Because in truth your eyes will be focused, your ears will be tuned, your nose will be testing the air. Your back will be straighter, your steps will be lighter. One never sleepwalks through grizzlyland, dreaming of other places to be. (p. 217, 1596916429)"
3,1596912995,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1291915-lauren,5,"The authors' style really resonated with me. He describes large earth-shattering revelations with such eloquence. Starting with the thesis that the death/extinction of predators and ""super""predators are to blame for many ecological/environmental, he delves into numerous case studies and ongoing research of many leading biologists. The first chapters discussion of the kelp forests along the Pacific rim was particularly interesting, and made a real case for the rest of the book: ecosystems MUST be looked at from the top-down, rather than the reverse. The scientists that Stolzenburg profiles methodically and systematically demonstrate how the top predators directly relate to such things as river ecology, plant/seed distribution, and seemingly unrelated things like Lyme disease. While so many points in this book stood out, I particularly enjoyed the one time humans got it ""right"": the reintroduction of wolves to Yellowstone Park in Wyoming in the mid-1990s. It was a success story, and I presume that it remains so this day, over ten years later. Simply put, this book was amazingly written and infinitely informative. If you care about nature, biodiversity, and the future of our planet and the creatures living on it, reading this book will help you gain insight on how setting life back into the natural balance will remedy many (unfortunately not all) of the ills we face. "
4,1596912995,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1821477-danielle,3,"This was an enjoyable book. However, for a book that was supposed to present ecology to the masses, it cited a lot of papers and scientists without applying much of the science to everyday life. The author oversimplified in an effort to appeal to everyone. For example, Stolzenberg discusses the eradication of feral cats to restore bird habitats and how it worked flawlessly. Then, while I was reading this book, scientists revealed that their attempts to eradicate feral cats on Macquerie Island in Australia had backfired because they had neglected to eradicate non-native species of rabbits at the same time.http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090113/a...  In turn, the rabbits, left without any natural predators, have devastated the fragile vegetation that the native birds depend on. This scenario demonstrates how complicated predator-prey interactions can be. Stolzenberg did not capture these complications. I also disagreed with his subtle attempt to advocate the reintroduction of megafauna from the Pleistocene era such as lions into North America without in-depth discussion of why this could also be a bad idea. I love elephants and lions, but I'm not sure they should be reintroduced just because they were here 10,000 years ago. In essence, for ecology students and professionals, this book will be an interesting read because they will be able to expand on the ideas that he presents. For people without a background in ecology, I fear this book will be a choppy introduction to megafaunal succession theory. It's worth reading, but just know that you're scratching the surface as becomes apparent. "
5,1596912995,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2915426-tippy-jackson,5,"This is now one of my favorite ecology books ever! It is incredibly engaging and has vitally important information. What is the role of top predators in an ecosystem? What happens when they are removed? I've heard of classic stories-such as the sea otters, sea urchins and kelp forest example, or the missing wolves, too many deer, death by disease and starvation example. And these are two of the many studies that come up-however they were presented with such depth that I felt like I was learning about them for the first time as new perspectives were brought to light. These studies and many more slowly built a picture of the world without our apex predators. It took the individual trees I'd been looking at and built a forest. I won't ever see the world in the same way again. Also, I think this would be a great companion book with David Quammen's Song of the Dodo.Notes:pg. 190- ""In a race with the furred and four-legged, the naked ape also ran cooler and more consistently than the competition. The running hominid vented heat not only through the panting mouth but also through the evaporative cooling from the sweatiest skin on the savanna. Running erect heightened the thermal advantage, exposing a minimum of bodily surface area to the sun.These were just a few of the examined traits that padded the Homo sapiens racing pedigree...Homo sapiens was born to run...The Bushmen's hunt would take place during the hottest times of the day, which in the Kalahari reached 108 degrees Fahrenheit.""pg. 198- ""Capable of traveling at bursts exceeding sixty miles per hour, the pronghorn is the second-fastest land animal on the planet-or the fastest depending on how far the race is run. Its sprint is slightly slower than that of the African cheetah's, but its pace over the mile is unmatched by any wild creature on legs. Its feats of footspeed are both legendary and true. Many who have spent any appreciable time driving through pronghorn country come back with a nuanced version of the same ensuing spectacle. It begins in the driver's seat of a pick up truck on a dusty road, far upon some open stretch of the American steppe, when out of the corner of the eye appears a band of pronghorn on the run-stick-legs a blur, white rumps shining, muscled necks craning forward. Over the sagebrush badlands tey fly, a squadron of hovercraft fluidly absorbing the terrain, hurtling forward at a frightening clip. The speedometer confirms what the eye struggles to fathom: forty-five miles per hour. The pronghorn are keeping pace, unveering, unflagging. One minute, two minutes-they are still going. They are racing the machine...Behind such outrageous displays of velocity are fearsome invisible forces. To see them, one must think back at least thirteen thousand years ago, before their disappearance. Before then the plains of North America were stampeded by an unprecedented cast of quick and deadly predators: a lion larger than its contemporary African subspecies; wolves of several varieties; a bear designed like a racehourse; a hyena with the legs of a coursing hound; and a cheetah with the legs of, well, a cheetah. Miracinonyx trumani was lithe yet larger than the modern African cheetah, and likely at least as fast. It was this sprinting cat, and the formidable packs of hyenas and the like, that made the American steppe a very lively place to grow up. They were the crucible in which the ultimate demon of speed, the American pronghorn was forged.""pg. 207 ""Are humans now functionally equivalent to large mammalian carnivores?...Sports hunters tend to go heavily for trophies, selecting the biggest, handsomest, fittest bulls and bucks-skimming the cream of the genetic crop. working carnivores, on the other paw, tend to take the young, the old, the lame, the weak, with efficiency of effort and immediate survival foremost in mind. Sport hunters tend to concentrate their kill in a few weeks of the regulated season, which means an elk in wolfless Colorado has ten or eleven months between hunting seasons to make a clear-cut or wallow of whatever streamside grove they care to lounge in. It means that scavengers like grizzlies-if there were any left in Colorado-would be more hard-pressed to feed their young in spring if the only carcasses were to be found in the wake of rifle hunters in the fall.Wolves, it has also been found, do not build roads into wilderness areas, chase animals to exhaustion on ATVs, howl at ninety decibels for hours on end, compact and erode soils, cave in stream banks, tear up meadows, crush plants, or foul the air with water and hydrocarbons.""BTW, for some shameless self-promotion, if you like reading about animals, check out my blog on wildlife at http://backyardzoologist.wordpress.com/"
6,1596912995,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2254007-grace,4,"SummaryWhen we look at the extinction of a species, there is an innate curiosity of our human minds to ask why. This book is a compilation of research and thoughts that have accumulated for quite a while regarding the role of predators in ecology. While Stolzenburg writes with a powerful prose, the subject matter is no-nonsense. What is the role of predators... including that of the human predator?Stolzenburg starts the story at his beginning to explain his motivation for searching this topic more in depth, then transfers seamlessly to the 1960s when the idea of predators having a key role in maintaining the balance of habitats as question that researchers were just beginning to take on. Stolzenburg covers key research pieces of the topic which he arranges in a sordid story of political plays, ego competitions, and retries by concerned conservation ecologists. Stolzenburg does not sugar coat the truth about the way that scientists and fellow policy makers can act when their dogma that they have adhered their reputation to is at stake. ThoughtsThis book is easy to follow for the non-ecologist, but rich enough in resources and data for any hardcore academic to use as a reference book. I particularly liked the flow from one event to another and the way Stolzenburg brought the stories alive by placing them in context of what the researchers in the book had experienced. It shows that science is not in a bubble, and everything is in context as well as changing depending on what that context is. I also appreciated the way that Stolzenburg did not shy away from the truth of things. He noted that research hangs somewhere in the balance of politics and ego. Good research was shunned from the likes of Science because someone that reviewed it did like it. Others attacked the researchers personally saying they were stupid for having a different idea. Still, the battle continues on even today.Stolzenburg also didn't shy away from outlining how bad science and research changed the textbooks, which in turn brainwashed an entire generation into believing that ecology can somehow stay balanced without the balance -- despite mountains of evidence. This, perhaps, is one of the more intriguing lessons that Stolzenburg and the predator debate had because while conservation ecologists were making headway to right all the wrongs that misguided humans had, one person doing bad science started a cascade that would halt -- and reverse -- any progress they had made toward restoring a delicate balance. I'm not an ecologist, but I'm a geoarchaeologist with a strong interest in habitat loss and landscape evolution. I had not really considered animals in my story up until now, but this book has opened my eyes to the domino effect that upsetting the balance can have on the environment. It's more complex than anyone ever realises, and even the most feared predators and humans play a vital role in maintaining the delicate balance of our habitat. "
7,1596912995,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1345046-todd-martin,5,"“Where the Wild Ones Were” makes the argument that large carnivores have a significant affect on the health of ecosystems and that their systematic eradication has contributed to environmental degradation. Examples provided include:1) Otter hunting led to a proliferation of anemones which led to the collapse of oceanic kelp forests.2) Eradication of wolves and mountain lions led to explosions in deer populations which subsequently degraded forests through overgrazing. In each case, degradation of the ecosystem led to larger loss of biodiversity – fewer birds, small mammals, insects, and plantlife.Evidence of the corollaries to this theory were also discussed:1) When wolves were re-introduced to Yellowstone, deer and elk populations declined and Aspen groves once again began to thrive.2) When otter hunts were eliminated, kelp forests returned.The author then goes on to discuss a controversial solution ... “re-wilding”. They argue that ecosystems began their degradation when humans first arrived in North America during the Pleistocene and exterminated megafauna such as the saber toothed cat, dire wolve, short-faced bear, cheetah, etc. Since these animals are now extinct, some biologiests propose introducing these animals closest existing relatives to restore balance. These reintroductions would include Bactrian camels, elephants, wolves, African lions, and cheetahs. Obviously public perception would need to undergo a considerable (and unlikely) transformation before such a concept could be implemented. The book ends on a rather depressing note, indicating that it may be too late to implement policies that would initiate a return to ecosystem health and that we are the poorer for it. As Edward Abbey said “The essence of wilderness is big animals that can eat you”. For the most part, that essence has been lost."

No matter how interesting the subject, it can make it difficult to wade through. William Stolzenburg does not have this problem. As the second book of his I have read, I was excited to start this one, and I was not left disappointed. Among the various tales of experiments and public critiques to management plans is the artistic skill of writing that so often is forgotten. It makes reading through the book not only a breeze, but entirely enjoyable as well. A perfect way to start the new year and a fundamental addition to any library for those who wish to know the truth of the importance of predators."
9,1596912995,http://goodreads.com/user/show/318324-kurt,4,"Fascinating synopsis of the recent research into the importance of predators -- especially the large predators -- in ecosystems. Very little was understood about this subject until very recently. Most of the research described in this book was done in just the past 20 years. The return of wolves to Yellowstone and central Idaho is currently demonstrating what significant, amazing, and often unexpected differences healthy packs of large predators can have on the overall health of an ecosystem. A very good book -- well written, interesting, and easily readable. A book that could, and should, benefit everyone."
10,1596912995,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6913891-linnaea,5,This was great book filled with interesting facts about predators. The section on Killer Whales is awesome and amazing - I read parts aloud to my room mate because I could not believe what I was reading and had to share how awesome these animals are. The book is about predators and their importance in the ecosystem. It has a chapter about Yellowstone National Park and the reintroduction of wolves which was a great read. Stolzenburg is a wildlife journalist and he has a very good narration making it easy to understand the different studies and experiments about predators.  A great book that I highly recommend.

15,1596912995,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13510236-richard-reese,5,"For the first billion years of life on Earth, all of our ancestors were single celled. One day, we aren’t sure why, a hungry organism ate a delicious bystander, and became the first predator. Predation inspired evolution to become very creative. Some organisms became mobile by developing cilia or tails. Others shape shifted into multi-celled life forms. Critters developed scales, spikes, shells, fangs, and many other clever defenses. Thus, one group survived by dining on the unlucky, and the bigger group survived by evolving every imaginable trick for cancelling lunch dates with predators.When predators became too powerful, they would wipe out their food supply, blush with embarrassment, and starve. Prey that managed to survive evolved stronger defensive capabilities. But if they got too good at this, their population would explode, deplete the available nutrients, and the vast mob would perish in an undignified manner.Thus, evolution is an elegant balancing act. If the prey gets one percent faster, the predator gets one percent faster, not two. This balancing act is the subject of William Stolzenburg’s book, Where the Wild Things Were. More specifically, the book focuses on how humankind uses its brilliant technological innovations to bypass the limits of our current state of evolution, upset healthy balancing acts, and devastate ecosystems, often unintentionally.In the early 1970s, zoologist James Estes travelled to the Aleutian Islands of Alaska to do research on sea otters. Sea otters can grow up to four feet long (1.2 m), and they have incredibly soft fur. Stylish women with too much money loved wearing fur coats, and for 150 years, from Alaska to Baja, otter hunting was a serious business, and very profitable. Somewhere between 500,000 and 900,000 otters lost their hides to the fashionable dames of high society.The island of Amchitka had a healthy population of otters, and this is where Estes began his study, scuba diving in frigid water. Beneath the waves were thriving jungles of kelp, a popular hangout for a number of aquatic herbivores. Kelp can grow up to 200 feet tall (61 m). Urchins enjoy dining on kelp, and sea otters enjoy dining on urchins. What Estes observed was a healthy balance between the kelp, urchins, and otters.Later, he spent some time on the island of Shemya, where the great extermination had wiped out the otters. Only a few had since recolonized there. The ecosystem here was stunningly different from Amchitka. In the absence of otters, the urchins exploded in numbers, and many were huge in size. The sea floor was wall-to-wall urchins, and there was no kelp at all. So, when the keystone predators (otters) live in peace, the ecosystem is healthy and balanced. When they are eliminated, the ecosystem becomes a train wreck — a chain reaction known as a trophic cascade. Predators are essential.A similar scenario occurred when Zion National Park was established in Utah. To make the park safe for tourists, the cougars (mountain lions) were exterminated. In their absence, the population of mule deer exploded, and the land was stripped of vegetation. The forests were dying, because young seedlings were devoured by deer. Meanwhile, over the hill in North Creek Canyon, the cougars had been left alone, and the land was remarkably alive and healthy.The Kaibab Plateau in Arizona became a game preserve in 1906. Deer hunters were kept out, and 6,000 large carnivores were deleted. The deer population skyrocketed from 4,000 to 100,000, and the vegetation was promptly vacuumed up. In the winters of 1924 and 1925, 80,000 deer starved to death. Ecosystems pay an enormous price for the stunning ecological ignorance of literate, educated people, who spend years in miserable classrooms carefully absorbing spooky illusions.Wolves and grizzlies had been absent in the Tetons for quite a while. Then, a few began drifting in from Yellowstone. At first, the moose and elk had no fear of them. Wolves calmly strolled into the herd and snatched their young. Before long, they learned that fearing predators was beneficial. Something similar to this innocent fearlessness likely existed in every ecosystem when humans first arrived with their state-of-the-art killing technology.In the 1950s, Paul Martin connected some archaeological dots. The megafauna of the world, that had survived almost two million years of ice ages, suddenly blinked out whenever armed humans arrived in a new region.* This realization gave birth to his Pleistocene Overkill hypothesis, “that man, and man alone, was responsible for the unique wave of Late Pleistocene extinction.” Despite many loud objections, it has generally been accepted, but it fails to explain the large numbers of mammoths and rhinos found in Siberia and Alaska. It also causes those who worship at the crumbling Temple of Human Omnipotence to become moody and irritable.Whatever your opinion on this controversy, it’s easy to argue that during the long era of warm weather (since 9600 B.C.), the pristine state of America was the Pleistocene, not 1492. In 2005, a group of biologists published a paper on rewilding in the journal Nature. It recommended the reintroduction of missing species like cheetahs, camels, lions, and elephants. The mainstream crowd soiled their britches and howled hysterically.It was, like, totally groovy to reintroduce pretty butterflies, but the huge backlash boiled down to “no lions in my backyard!” This was the lively kickoff for what will be a long and bumpy process of attitude evolution — or a fierce backlash from those who have yet to free themselves from the tiny cage of anthropocentric hallucinations.I wonder if the systematic extermination of millions of predators over the years is associated in any way with the current explosion in the human population. (Duh!) When climate change forced our ancestors onto the savannah, evolution had not prepared us for living amidst fast, powerful, heavyweight predators. We developed a highly unusual dependence on technology in order to survive, thereby knocking over the evolutionary balancing act. “They would eventually wield the power to level mountains, to dam the biggest rivers, to coat entire continents in concrete and crops, to alter the climate as it had once altered them.” The chapter on how we morphed into apex predators is fascinating.Today, we almost never encounter man-eating predators running lose. We no longer have to pay careful attention to reality, ready to react at any moment, fully present and alive. The world has become safe for pudgy cell phone zombies — an empty, dull, and lonely place. This is seen as normal. I disagree.* Megafauna survived in Africa because they evolved together with hominids, but there’s more to the story. Lars Werdelin, a specialist in African carnivores, has learned that there used to be far more large carnivores. Between 2 and 1.5 million years ago, many large carnivores went extinct. This is about the time that tool-using, meat-eating Homo erectus appeared. (Werdelin, Lars, “King of Beasts,” Scientific American, November 2013, pp. 34-39.)"
16,1596912995,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29611504-lacy,3,"This book got better once I had adjusted to the writing style. There was a lot of flourishment where I don't think it was needed, but that's a personal preference for me. I learned a lot from this book about the vital role predators play in our ecosystems and how humans have thrown the many delicate balances of nature out of wack. No surprises there. Not a book for everyone but, if you are interested in the topic and pick it up, my recommendation is to stick with it."
17,1596912995,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25371127-rossdavidh,3,"I put off buying this book for a while, because of the title. There is a certain kind of science book which I am really tired of, and the title made it look like it was this kind of book. That kind, is the sort wherein you are told with every paragraph, for a few hundred pages, that We Are All Doomed.I don't even necessarily disagree (all that much) with the premise. I just don't see a reason to read a book about it. Despite much posturing to the contrary, it is not within the power of an individual to make us non-doomed, and despite the apparent belief of half of the internet or more, getting really, really, really mad (or sad, or loud) about something doesn't really impact its likelihood of occurring. So, I prefer to read books which tell me things I don't know. ""We Are All Doomed"" is something I already know.Fortunately, at some point I actually picked up this book and looked through it, and made the very pleasant discovery that, aside from the obligatory last chapter (wherein it is explained that We Are All Doomed), the rest of the book, the vast vast majority, is about telling you science that you probably don't know.I had heard, generally speaking, that the return of wolves to Yellowstone National Park had turned out to be a good thing. I had also heard the phrase ""keystone species"", often the apex predator of an ecosystem, whose loss is even more devastating to that ecosystem than other species. But I had not read all of the science (and science history) about how this works.Why, for example, is it important for wolves to hunt moose in Yellowstone, rather than just having some human hunters go thin the herd from time to time? Why is it that having wolves in Yellowstone, is good for aspen trees? Why is the abundance of deer in much of North America a disaster for wildflowers? Why is the loss of big cats and wolves bad for the songbird population?Much of it comes down to that old phrase, ""the enemy of my enemy is my friend"", but not everything. For example, the kind of deer (or moose, or whatever) that a human hunter picks out for a spot on their wall, or the place where they decide to hunt for it, are different than if it's an apex predator doing the hunting.There is also some fascinating discussion of the uncomfortable (to those on the political left, especially) fact that extinction in North America started long before 1492. It is odd to think of North America, just a few thousand years ago, with mammoths (thirteen feet at the shoulder), wild horses, giant bison, giant camels, a beaver as big as a bear, the saber-tooth cat, the dire wolf, a native American cheetah, and a bear with the shoulder-height of a moose. They all lived in North America, and within a few thousand years of the coming of humans, they were all gone. Coincidence?It is not just fascinating imagery like this that makes the book a good read, though. There was a whole generation-long struggle within the scientific community over whether or not to accept the fact that nature, really, is a strict hierarchy, and it's the ones at the top that matter the most in many ways. It is no secret that scientists are, on the whole, considerably left of center, and it is hard to think of a concept more ill-suited to easy acceptance.But, to their credit, scientists did (eventually) allow themselves to be swayed by the evidence, and this is a great book to help explain how it happened. Then, in the final (and shortest) chapter, you can also read how We Are All Doomed. Or, like me, you can kind of skim that part. It's a good book nonetheless."
18,1596912995,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24670176-meenatchi,4,"In the nonfiction novel, Where the Wild Things Were: Life, Death, and Ecological Wreckage in a Land of Vanishing Predators, published in the year 2008, William Stolzenburg explains about how the lack of big predators like wolves and grizzly bears affects all ecosystems in a shocking way. The beginning half of the novel covers the history of how scientists from all walks of life compiled their knowledge together to prove that predators are paramount for the survival of ecosystems and, in the long run, humans. Stolzenburg also includes the difficulties that these scientists faced to prove their theories true not only to the public, but to their fellow scientists, who were the biggest obstacle. The second half of the novel talks about what scientists and their allies have done to help decrease the impacts of the problem, from reintroducing predators to forming groups like The Defenders of Wildlife that pay money for the protection of predators. To convey these points clearly, Stolzenburg writes about various experiments in detail, such as the experiment done by Robert T. Paine, where Paine throws starfish into the sea to see how the organism’s primary prey, mussels, react. This was one of the first experiments that confirmed how necessary predators are to an ecosystem because without the starfish praying on the mussels, the mussels took over the small ecosystem, evicting other organisms that also lived there. This leads to the fact that the more society kills predators that we classify as dangerous, the more likely that the ecosystems that once stood today will not survive in the coming future. I strongly recommend this novel to high school students because they are the next generation that has a chance of making a difference for the predators that currently reside on our planet. William Stolzenburg does a wonderful job informing the public about the scientists that figured out this mystery and what is at stake when people kill predators without regard. He does though use many scientific names to refer to some of the organisms, which may be confusing to readers. Reading the book, I learned about the horrible things humans have done due to fear of predatory animals and the need for resources. It also amazes me how the public refuses to admit to the truth unless it satisfies their own agenda. For example, when James A. Estes, a scientist, wrote a paper about how the sea otters were disappearing due to killer whales, the public saw it as a potential excuse to kill killer whales. Sadly, this kind of misinterpretation happens far too often in our growing society, as it is easier to accept what benefits us rather than what doesn’t. Despite the good parts of the novel, there is one thing that could be improved upon. The fact that Stolzenburg refers to the organisms by their scientific names most of the time can be a bit intimidating for anyone not familiar with the names. This can be quite distracting for a reader, especially when they don’t remember what a scientific name refers to, which in turn ruins the flow of the text. Even though I strongly recommend this book for high school students, adults can still benefit from reading this novel because every adult’s decision can affect the life of a young predator coming into the world in the future."

But I was pleasantly surprised to find that I was invested by the middle of the book. The chapters became laid out quite well, each one illustrating the significance of a particular predator. The wolves at Yellowstone was definitely one of the “sexier” stories, but I also enjoyed about reading the coyotes in CA, mountain lions at Zion, and the otters and the kelp forests. They were all well-written and compelling.Overall, the book left me with a sad feeling. There can be such a case made for the return of large predators – the stories laid out in the book are romantic and inspiring. But I think humans in general are fearful, and have the “not in my backyard” mindset. Big predators are scary and we don’t want to think about them being in our immediate areas … we long to see predators, but we are also relieved that they are secured. The stories of people living in mega-predator country are inspiring though – there may be no simple solutions, but they are making it work.Other stray thoughts: shifting baseline syndrome is an interesting and sad phenomenon. Good science is important. I was surprised that the author used some inflammatory labels for some predators (“killers”, “murderers”, etc). This book also did a good job illustrating the importance of good storytelling (whether it meant to or not). Overall, good read. It certainly ended up being a good book club book – lots to talk and think about. "
20,1596912995,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57086222-tom-woolf,5,"This is a fantastic book. Each chapter is a vignette, telling the story of a particular group of predators, and the scientists who did the work of deciphering those predators' keystone role in an ecosystem. These chapters weave together to form a tapestry of the history of predator ecology. Each chapter stands alone as a compelling narrative, and the whole presents a unifying and compelling thesis on predator conservation and restoration. If you don't already know concepts like green world hypothesis, trophic cascades, top-down ecological control, mesopredator release, ecological meltdown scenarios, rewilding, and shifting baselines, you will find a wealth of important ideas here. If you do already understand these things, you will find that this book beautifully explores the development of these concepts as parts of a single larger story.This book avoids the pitfalls that afflict some non-fiction science and nature writing. It is neither overly lyrical, nor so dense with data as to become an informative slog. It is a compelling read that, once started, was difficult to put down. Also the kind of book that led me to frequently interrupt my wife to read passages from. I highly recommend it.Incidentally, some of the studies and the scientists that feature prominently in Where the Wild Things Were are also the subject of the PBS Nature episode, ""The Serengeti Rules"" (https://www.pbs.org/wnet/nature/seren...). It makes a great video accompaniment to the book."
21,1596912995,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38789239-liisa,4,"Where the Wild Things Were is a non fiction book giving a satisfyingly comprehensive view on predator ecology. Starting from the development of basic ecological concepts such as trophic cascades and key species and continuing to more specified research on the importance of predators, William Stolzenburg doesn't shy away from exploring the likely implications of our impoverished landscapes. However, this does not read like research, not in the least. Stolzenburg has gathered an impressive amount of studies but laid them out as a captivating story – bringing the scientists and their objects of study alive on the pages. The titles of the chapters such as Bambi’s Revenge, Little Monsters’ Ball and Dead Creatures Walking give a taste of the nearly poetic nature of the writing. The structure feels incoherent at times, but following scientific discoveries is not easy as the development of different theories overlap. It’s also not simple to decide how to balance the science, the descriptions and the storylines, and it doesn’t always work quite as well as it could. I certainly hope that a part of my biology study materials would come in such a form as Where the Wild Things Were instead of the endless scientific papers. At least I can revise through books like this and having studied a lot of this stuff before, I didn’t notice anything deviating significantly from what I’ve learned in university. But I do wish is that effects of predator free communities were highlighted more in ecology modules, especially as wolves in Finland are such a current topic. "

This is not something I would normally read but it ""called to me across the crowded library"" 😉 and I'm so glad I answered!This book is really important! I know it's not really the type of book that appeals to many people, but it should! It shows what happens when you remove apex predators from their environments. We tend to think the world would be a better place with less things that could eat us, our children or our pets, but each predator plays a vital role in the sustainability of their ecosystem and the viability of our planet. This wasn't a dry book at all. It is a weighty topic but it was written in such a way that it was engaging! It is filled with individual examples of studies showing the effects of the removal of the predators. What each different scientist found were the results of their studies. I also like that the author gave us the background of the scientists. That was as fascinating as their studies and the results of their research! ☺ It appealed to both sides of my brain, the side that cared about the science and the side that cared about the scientist. ☺I am glad I followed my instincts and read this book! I am equally glad for the lessons it taught me. My outlook on my world is forever changed because of this book, and that's almost always a good thing. ☺"

I think it’s natural for humans to want to distance themselves or destroy the things that they fear, the things that can kill them gruesomely. But at some point humanity must mature and realize with the amount of control we have on this world, we have to act responsibly especially towards the other plants and animals that call this planet home. We still have a lot to understand. Nature is a complex system that we don’t fully grasp. We have to be careful not to ruin it and run it into the ground. "

Some of the innovative studies he covers reveal the cascades of habitat destruction that follow eliminations of top predators. Other studies document the surprising recovery of ecosystems, once the wolves, bears, big cats, otters, or eagles return. Stolzenburg writes like a first-hand witness to his heroes' trials in the field, the storms of controversy surrounding their work, and their moments of Darwin-like, consensus-changing insight. This is a powerfully written book that conveys the beauty and power of supposedly enemy creatures, while scientifically demonstrating how crucial they are for the planet's health."

Could have benefitted from an editor pulling out the idiosyncrasies of an odd journalistic style. It's like Maureen Dowd wrote a couple sentences in each of the early chapters.I understand from outside reading that the theories described in the book have some very strong critics, and that the function of predation in an ecosystem is still very much an active research topic.

42,1596912995,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61741695-z-s-saraf,5,"What a poetic, eye-opening, delightfully conscious and at times, sobering scientific account of mankind's venturing abilities- abilities that often act as a double-edged sword! This book got me interested in wildlife and ecosystem conservation and made me understand the supreme importance of conservation efforts, with irrefutable data to back the sentiment. Graduating from a social sci background and with the meagre experience of studying Biology at high school and college, I still was blissfully ignorant about much of the important things the book talks about and examples from real life it draws- like keystone species. Glad I stumbled upon this book- from the recommendation list of my fav astrophysicist, Neil deGrasse Tyson.Loved this book the way it is, but I wonder if adding interesting artistic illustrations and computer generated graphics of the extinct animals would have livened the book up for readers from non-biology backgrounds. I had to Google a lot to get a more detailed description of the extinct animals. Another aspect of the book that left me quite wanting is that it detailed much of the vanishing predatory landscapes of both the American continent, although the focus was undoubtedly on North America. It could have been a more 'global' attempt, if I may use that word, by drawing on more cases from Asia and Africa, in particular. Because without detailing extinct animals of Asia and Africa, a book about extinct animals just... don't feel whole.However, I understand the limitations that might have caused that; that including more cases of extinction from Asia and Africa would have made the book lengthier and denser, and perhaps that was not something the author wanted to focus on."
43,1596912995,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1693924-jamie-elliott,4,"Rarely have I encountered a book that does such an excellent job of presenting scientific research. Attending a scientific conference on ecology, William Stolzenburg experienced a revelation familiar to many who pursue scientific endeavors; a chance encounter ignited in him an unexpected and consuming interest in a query about the natural world. The discipline of his fancy was the study of predator species and their importance, if any, to ecological communities as a whole. Are top predators really uniquely important in shaping ecological systems? Fired with an interest in this question, Stolzenburg dives into the history of predator research, visiting the sites and the scientists that are pivotal to the field. In “Where the Wild Things Were” he reports his findings.Stolzenburg beautifully describes a series of fascinating ecological experiments and observations, and is particularly careful to identify potential bias and to warn against overgeneralization. Refreshingly, he approaches his question with a genuine interest in really looking at the evidence and thus determining the answer rather than pontificating or rationalizing a conclusion reached in a non-scientific way.Inescapably, in system after system, Stolzenburg reports that the effects of predator species are surprisingly far-reaching. Starfish not only determine the ecological diversity of tidal pools, but pumas and eagles are essential for monkey social structures and the presence of wolves and coyotes protects native flowers and song birds. The evidence is overwhelming; losing top tier predators can cause ecosystems to deteriorate in profound and unexpected ways.This knowledge is clearly of extreme important to those who want to stem the loss of the ecological diversity of our world. There is a very large constituent of people that firmly believe that all predators are bad predators, that the only good wolves and coyotes are dead, and that any contrary sentiment is so much uninformed liberal heart bleeding. Stolzenburg’s book is vital in that it presents the relevant research and conclusions in such an unbiased way that it may, just possibly, convince some members of this group. I feel I could send this book to a certain Wisconsin deer hunter I know, without offending him; as a sportsman, he naturally views all predators as unwanted competition, reintroduction and protection as at best a waste of government money. But he loves songbirds, the lush diversity of plants and animals that can be found in more remote spaces. Could this book convince him and his brethren that protection of predators is worth minor inconveniences, as a vital step in securing the health of beloved species and ecosystems? I reserve judgment, but if the clear explication of this book has no effect, I am not sure what could."
44,1596912995,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2958674-nikki,3,"I was a bit disappointed after finishing Where the Wild Things Were as I believed it would be more focused on today's issues and have more in the way of information for myself. While it may come packed with information for the laymen, I am well-versed in ecology, ecosystems, the predator/prey relationship and am current on humans vs. nature issues that abound. So the book offered me very little in the way of new information, if any, although it did make me tear up quite a few times at the graphic depictions of wolf deaths that the author included. Hopefully such graphic scenes will make some think differently regarding their approach to nature. Overall, the information included became somewhat repetitive and was reduced for the non-scientific individual to understand that I found myself rather bored.The chapters where I felt the author excelled were the ones where he stopped distancing himself in the name of scientific writing, leaving his voice to be clearer in both the introduction and epilogue. However, the chapters in between were riddled with scientists' bios, brief stories (in order to help individuals relate to the facts at hand) and such with the point of many things being buried in order to be non-biased/scientific/not to step on too many toes. But Stolzenburg excels when he decreases the distance between author and audience so I felt this distancing weakened the book overall.One of the greatest stories in the book of predators being eradicated is regarding wolves. Wolves which have been vilified for centuries and were once nearly eradicated. With a wolf introduction program begun in 1995, wolves began a comeback. Much to the support of the information in this book, wolves brought a semblance to the ecosystem and helped keep the ecosystems in which they lived healthy. However, since the book has been published wolves have yet again become the focus of vilification. Wolves have lost protections in large regions of the U.S. and are being hunted once again. The very politician mentioned in the book that wished to see a population of no more than 100 wolves in his state is trying to make it a reality, and just might. The same vitriol many hold for nature is the vitriol I hold for human nature, absolutely vile creatures with greed beyond imagination."
45,1596912995,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2440492-molly-ringle,5,"Not to sound like a cheesy book-blurb review, but: if you're going to read just one book about ecology this decade, read this one! We all love to hear about big cool animals (charismatic megafauna, as they called them in Anthro classes, and as Stolzenburg calls them once or twice too), but usually we feel it's just as well we don't live among them. However, how deeply have we looked into the consequences of the absence of those big animals? Stolzenburg takes us deep into those consequences, in convincing scientific detail and fairness, and the results are rather horrifying. You come away realizing that, compared to the natural wonderland that used to flourish on the planet just a few thousand years ago, we now already live in a sci-fi dystopia. But it isn't a depressing read! He doesn't want it to be, and rounds up several shining examples of current trend-reversing progress that made me want to cheer out loud. The wolves returning to Yellowstone and the ensuing improvement of the landscape is the most famous example, and is wondrously cool--go Google it if you don't know about it. But our forests probably need a lot more ""rewilding"" than just a pack of wolves here and there in a national park. I'm convinced of it now, and I hope this book goes crazily popular and convinces millions more people too.I could go on and on about it, but I'd end up with a multi-page book report summarizing everything Stolzenburg says. And since he writes so gorgeously, you might as well just read his book--seriously, the writing itself kept charming and impressing me. It gracefully shifts from lyrical to colloquial and back again, lively throughout, a delight to read. A few days ago, in the midst of reading this book, I took one of my kids to the zoo, and ended up lingering several extra minutes at the compound where four gorgeous gray wolves trotted and lounged. I'm glad they're here where we can visit them, but now I hope, more than ever, that many more of them can run free in our mountains."
46,1596912995,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71658-aj,4,"Disclaimer: I won a free copy of this book from Goodreads' First Reads.This book was fantastic. From the start it was a compelling read and I had a hard time putting it down. The book is about predators and their role in nature, biodiversity, etc. The author does a great job of discussing the science behind everything while keeping the book readable and interesting. I found the book free of jargon, academic-ese or anything else you might find off-putting in a scientific text. In essence, it's very well-written and would appeal to a layperson or a scientist (such as myself).I found the overall nature of the book to be upbeat even though the author does concede that humans ultimately have the choice of which species we will allow to continue to exist, and that we haven't made terribly good choices in the past. He lays out the ecological ramifications of ridding the world of predators, many of which are obviously apparent to anybody who has ever lived in the suburbs and dealt with deer.Books like this always make me wish I could go back in time tens of thousands of years to see what life was like before the dawn of agriculture. I feel like the world would have been a much more beautiful, although I'm sure dangerous, place. And that is definitely a big theme in this book. What will humans chose? Keeping carnivores around to deal with pesky animals such as deer, or letting them perish and living in an uglier place as a result. The author doesn't attempt to answer the question but lays out what's at stake and allows us to decide for ourselves."
47,1596912995,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10445857-bill,3,"An interesting and lively presentation of the importance of predators and their deep influence on ecosystems, this book presents scientific findings interspersed with the stories of the researchers and their work to make those discoveries. Readers new to ecological concepts will find the book enlightening; others more familiar with ecology should find the backstories of researchers interesting enough to enjoy reading through to the end.Most of the research detailed in the first few chapters represents classic studies that can be found in many biology textbooks, such as R.T. Paine's removal of starfish from rocky outcroppings on the Olympic Peninsula or the research of James Estes into the interaction of sea otters, kelp forests, and killer whales. But where a textbook may summarize these studies in a few paragraphs with accompanying figures to illustrate, Stolzenburg dedicates chapters to each discovery and the passions and strivings of its discoverer and the research assistants who helped him. I had some trouble with Stolzenburg's writing style; he is overly fond of commas. Often his descriptions go on for one or two clauses too long, and there were several places where clauses didn't need to be separated by a comma, yet one snuck in. This is pedantic, sure, but it can interrupt the flow of a narrative for those of us who notice such things.  All in all, this is a book to recommend to anyone interested in the important reverberating effects that human actions have throughout ecological communities and ecosystems who has not already explored the topic before."
48,1596912995,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1476867-starbubbles,4,"I really loved this book. It was fascinating and a true page turner. I was with the premise of the book up until the end. I don't understand the argument of a food-web without the presence of people. Where do people fit in? Are they the over populated deer, the middle predator coyote, or the environment changing apex predator of the mountain lion? People can fit into all of these categories depending on the perspective. What does a balance population look like with people? Is it possible? What does a balanced urban population look like? Why does a balanced environment only apply in the absence of people? Also, in the re-wilding theory of reintroducing elephant, lion, and cheetah populations in North America, why is it believed that nature did not rebalance itself since the Ice Age? Isn't that farfetched? I can see wanting to reverse the over hunting ways of the 19th century. That clearly was man's doing. But can our ecological system handle an elephant population? Isn't it also arrogant to say that the people on the continent of Africa cannot protect their animal populations? That the people in North America have to do it for them, you know since we had it first anyway. Clearly I still have questions. The ending left a bad taste in my mouth, and that was why I did not rate it at a 5star. But I do highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys nature and cause and effect. "
49,1596912995,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6101263-amy,4,"I wish everyone would read this book - especially hunters. This is NOT an anti-hunting book, but it does examine the importance of ""keystone predators"" to an ecosystem. Using the Yellowstone wolves as one of many examples, Stolzenburg explores how removal of important predators like wolves, coyotes, and cougars drastically and dramatically sends a system into an imbalance. As a result, hoofed herbivores take over and destroy plant and animal species that relied on the equilibrium delivered by predators. The authors writes, ""The most dangerous experiment is already underway. The future most to be feared is the one now dictated by the status quo. In vanquishing our most fearsome beasts from the modern world, we have released worst monsters from the compound. They come in disarmingly meek and insidious forms, in chewing plagues of hoofed beats and sweeping hordes of rats and cats and second-order predators. They come in the form of denuded seascapes and barren forests, ruled by jellyfish and urchins, killer deer and sociopathic monkeys. They come as haunting demons of the human mind. In conquering the fearsome beasts, the conquerors have unwittingly orphaned themselves.""This book expects some background knowledge in the fields of biology, ecology, and anthropology, but it is a fascinating read. "
50,1596912995,http://goodreads.com/user/show/975391-steven,4,"This book outlines the theories and discoveries about the importance of carnivores to the environment, and how this thinking has shaped conservation biology and ecology over the last 40 years. Stolzenburg has a gift for writing that brings the scientists and animals he covers to life. There are so many cliches in our culture about ""the circle of life,"" but Stolzenburg, although passionate about large carnivores, even-handedly reveals the intricate connections between them and their environment, and the experiments and observers that made these connections. I was especially intrigued by the thinking and work that went into seeing the connections between viable sea otter populations and the existence of healthy kelp forests. And the fact that aspens in Yellowstone stopped reproducing successfully during the seven decades that wolves were absent from the park, but are now on the rebound.Knowing how these processes work doesn't necessarily translate to fixing broken biomes, but if you're interested in either the scientific process or the creatures they study, you'll want to read this."
51,1596912995,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12279843-mark,5,"This book is sad but hopeful - yes WE NEED CARNIVORES!!! LISTEN AND THINK ABOUT IT!!! Ecosystems collapse without them. Beavers disappear - beavers create wetlands and meadows which means habitat for fish, song birds, moose. Beavers need trees. Beavers don't hunt herbivores. Wolves do. Without the wolves, the elks and deer eat the saplings. They never grow into trees. We humans have a primal fear of wolves. We have to learn to live with them or everything will collapse. Yellowstone was dying. All the aspens and willows there were over 60 years old before the wolves were brought back. Now there are beaver ponds again in Yellowstone. This is the most inspiring book I have read in a long time. What I am trying to say here is that ecology is not a luxury for the rich to enjoy. It means that soil doesn't erode so that food can still be grown to feed everyone, animal and human. It means that grass lands and forests again become carbon sinks instead of sources of pollution and erosion. Just remember to be afraid of the dark and grateful for the wolves and jaguars and bears who keep the forests and grasslands alive."

It was full of new ideas*, for me, explained in lay terms and complete with enough observations to make the ideas fit into my existing cognitive framework. For human interest, Stolzengburg describes the scientists who advanced these new (for me) theories, along with their backgrounds and some of the problems they had having other scientists accept their theories. He also has some excruciatingly gory descriptions of life in the wild. The last chapter is a rant, which I also loved, feeling almost the exact same way about what is happening to life on earth as Stolzenburg feels. I liked the book so much that, at the end, I read all of the notes on all of the chapters so that I could keep reading.I even know some of the people he quoted!*The main idea of the book is that the large carnivores of the earth control eco-systems by preventing organisms lower on the food chain from getting too populous and decimating the organisms below them, etc., etc., and thus destroying the entire system."

This book contains several examples of trophic cascades caused by predator removal--as well as some reversals caused by predator reintroduction--in the US as well as other countries. I thought the author did a wonderful job in describing how necessary predators are not only to a food web, but to the existence of seemingly unrelated organisms as well. He goes into detail about ecosystems such as Yellowstone, for example, where the reintroduction of wolves not only keeps the numbers of elk under control, but also allows aspen, willow, flowers, songbirds, bees, and a host of other living things to thrive. I highly recommend this both for people with an interest in conservation and/or predators, and especially for those who think that predators should be reduced or eliminated."
54,1596912995,http://goodreads.com/user/show/185389-molly,3,"Dammit to hell, it seems the review I wrote has been gobbled up by an interwebs monster. Oh well, I'll try again. This is a good book, thought provoking, I learned some things and I enjoyed reading it. However, it is not without it's flaws. The author states he is biased and he wasn't kidding. Over and over again he would present cases that show the importance of apex predators but too little time is given to the other side of the argument. He states scientists and others don't agree with many of the views he espouses but he doesn't say why they disagree or even outline their basic arguments against. So if you're looking for the other side of the story this is not it. That said, I still recommend this book. It will make you think and possibly depress you given the state of affairs ecologically speaking what with biodiversity in decline and the outlook for the future grim. It is all very troubling to me. "
55,1596912995,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5946412-elizabeth,5,"One of the best books I've read in a long time! The author does a great job of explaining in laymen's the science behind all of these ecological concepts. This book details the importance of top predators in an ecosystem and the negative effects that occur when they are removed. It starts simple with a look at seastars in the North Pacific tide pools and moves onto more complex lifeforms in more complex environments. It also chronicles the history of conservation biology and the inception of new concepts (i.e. keystone species, green world hypothesis). I think it should be required reading for any ecology class. This book also hints at the politics of predator conservation. This is definitely a conservation oriented book. It is full of facts and science but is easy to understand and fun to read. I personally wish it had been a longer book. There are examples from around the world of ecological nightmares where all the big predators have been removed."
56,1596912995,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22587151-joi-lin,5,"I probably refer to, and recommend this book more, than any other I have ever read, I think. It is that powerful and moving. Essentially it makes the case, using case studies of otters in the Pacific Northwest, wolves in Yellowstone National Park, and orcas in oceans around the world, for why ecosystems need apex predators to not only thrive, but to even survive. That is such a simplified, watered-down summary for what is really an elegant and, to me, quite moving treatise....some might think a tome on ecology would be a dry and slow-moving work, but this book is anything but! There are enough real-world examples to keep it interesting, and the author draws parallels with our human world in such a way that kept me turning the pages well past my bedtime. It is an almost heart-breakingly elegant outcry to support all of our large predators, wherever we may find them - before it becomes too late, and we suffer the impact of their loss in ways we didn't even know were possible. "
57,1596912995,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9604131-woody,4,"A well-written and researched book about the demise of large ""apex"" predators, and the negative impacts on ecosystems that have resulted. On a positive note, the book also documents the beneficial role that re-introduced predators such as the Gray Wolf can have on restoring ecosystems (i.e. Yellowstone). The book discusses wolves, grizzlies, coyotes, eagles, house cats and even starfish. In the absence of apex predators, secondary predators have often taken over, such as baboons, raccoons, badgers, coyotes, house cats and dogs. And as we all know, deer have run rampant in recent years, with their own set of negative consequences ranging from the spread of Lyme's disease, to car-deer collisions, and over grazing of public and private lands. In sum, the book makes the case for retaining predators to stabilize and diversify ecosystems. Old-school human culture, steeped in folklore and often intolerant of predators, stands in the way. "
58,1596912995,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11889175-christopher,4,"I have always been obsessed with predatory animals. I had heard about 'rewilding' from george Mionbot but this was my first engagement with it beyond a few articles. Its nice when the reintroduction of apex predators serves far more than an aesthetic and rather as a viable and necessary method of saving the world from unchecked prey and unbalanced systems.There is always that part of me that greatly prefers the honesty of ecology to the numerous vagaries of BS which is the history I chose to focus on. But it is my hope that one day the humanities will learn to study itself by learning from the interconnected field of ecology.And that our wilds will be reborn from a period of dour sterility-thanks to the most fearsome of beasts. Beasts whose very challenge to our primitive ancestors helped make us what we would one day become.Nature, like humanity, is morally neutral. But only the first admits it."

Having already studied most of the cases outlined in the book I can't say it added too much to my knowledge but it is good for people looking for an overview or as a starting point for looking deeper into the topic - I know I'll probably dig up some of the references to read (yeah, I'm a nerd shhh). So the rating is more in terms of the general population than myself personally. However, I do understand that this is an incredibly complicated topic, both the ecosystems themselves and the options for fixing what is broken are just vast topics and a more detailed book would probably end up being off putting to most. But yeah, this book and Song of the Dodo are probably the two books that showcase how royally we are messing up the planet and the importance of at least trying to do something about it "

After being sent to bed without supper for being too chaotic Max’s bedroom magically transforms into an unknown world. He sails to an island populated by bests known as the “Wild Things”, and shortly Max becomes their leader. He then decides to leave the island and return home, where there he finds a hot supper waiting. The images in this book are almost daunting; the Wild Things are enormous, terrifying creatures of the island. With that being said those images are what make the book so appealing to the eye. Through his images the author is able to create an entire magical world that is filled with these mysterious creatures. I remember reading this as a child and loving it. It is awesome to still feel the same about a book when you're a young adult. Reading where the wild things are made me feel like a kid reading it again. "
61,1596912995,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51547910-david-rudin,5,"This was an amazing book! One of those precious few that I was sorry to be done with. Stolzenburg is one of those rare writers who can make science interesting. He does this in part by telling the story of the scientists' lives who make the discoveries. The book was not new material for me, as it covers the concept of trophic cascades. This ecological idea, in a nutshell, looks at how the loss of a top predator creates cascades down through the rest of the trophic levels. Some of these stories have been told many times, such as the return of the wolves to Yellowstone and how that has begun to reverse some of the damage caused by their initial removal in the 192o's. Though not told for the first time, I would argue that no one has done a better job of telling these stories. Then by amassing the best examples and weaving these stories together, Stolzenburg has created a must read for anyone interested in ecology, predators or simply a healthy planet!"
62,1596912995,http://goodreads.com/user/show/339857-cindy,4,"I spotted this one at the library and the title caught my eye - is that a misprint? But no, it was right. I was intrigued. And then, of course, there was that gorgeous cat on the cover. I wanted to know more. I had heard nothing about the idea of rewilding before I picked up this book, or about predator driver ecology, but living in the west, I do hear a lot about Yellowstone and the wolves there. So I'm not completely unfamiliar with the concepts here, but I'm certainly no expert. I found it very readable and persuasive. I'm afraid I bored my family by telling them all about my reading for days and found myself dreaming that I was going to Quebec to hire people to conduct a study on reintroducing bears and then that we had walruses in the house. I can't promise the book won't disturb your sleep, but it was still worth it!"

An ardent wanderer through nature, I found my self disturbed, but as a scientist I found myself in awe. As though I could finally see the interlocking pieces of the environment around me. This book goes far beyond the ""Deer of the Kiabab"" predicament. The case study is no more than a brief mention of similarity to the collapses, hiccups, colicy bouts, death beds, and slowly healing systems we've created on this world. I use this book to teach 9th grades about ecosystem fragmentation because the stories and the writing captivate. I wish more authors wrote about the state of our ecosystems. Bringing them further into economics maybe the only hope we have of saving the ever essential places in which we love to temporarily vacation."

When my roomie Paula recommended this book I wasn't entirely sure what to expect. It turns out it was a book expressing my exact feelings in regard to predator ecology and trophic cascades but with glorious scientific citation to back it all up! I highly recommend for anyone interested in predator ecology or the return of major predators for the stabilization of natural ecosystems. This book is adapted to be easily understood by the scientist as well as the layman. I guarantee that it will change the average person's view on major predators. My only regret is that there is no mention of the return of red wolves to North Carolina, and that my most favorite major carnivores, the ever-adaptable coyote, doesn't get enough love."
65,1596912995,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2659716-martin-cohen,5,"In addition to being a good nature book, this is a fine journalistic effort. It is loosely organized around the work of groups of naturalists who explored the role of predators in nature. This provides a nice thread linking the various examples. It also provides a bit of drama and mystery, since the ecological importance of top predators was initially met with skepticism. The book is highly readable as well as a learning experience. There is a nice section on the delicate balance between wolves and elk and I got confirmation of my belief that in its size range domesticated cats are top notch predators. Through no fault of the author, the end of the book is not a happy one, although the epilogue shows how we have come to be more enlightened about the importance of keystone predators. I was left feeling wistful for a time when nature truly was red in tooth and claw."
66,1596912995,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1685650-samuel,5,"  One of my all time favorite non-fiction books. This book talks about what happened to the large predators of the N. American continent by examining current ecological cases in a not too technical way. It's an. Environmentalist call to awareness and action without the ""it is all man's fault"" guilt trip. It readily admits natural environmental evolution that causes some species to go extinct and others to thrive or develop at the same time as encouraging us to be good stewards of the earth by being careful about how our actions effect ecological systems. It also warns against over correcting or causing more damage to ecological systems in our efforts of conservation and environmental initiatives. It does all this in a way that is very readable with almost story-like prose as opposed to technical jargon. It was readable like Diamond's Guns Germs and Steal or Mcolough's 1776. "

As an awe-inspired visitor to Yellowstone Park, and an author with more than a passing interest in wolves (See Red Wolf by Jennifer Dance, published by Dundurn) I particularly enjoyed the chapters on the reintroduction of wolves to Yellowstone. Well done, William, for bringing all this scientific data together in a format that most people can understand. This book amplifies and clarifies the information in the short video on trophic cascade; How wolves change rivers.(www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysa5OBhXz-Q ) "

The book’s author, William Stolzenburg, manages to include just about every classic predator ecology paper that I can recall having studied in my general ecology courses, but he deftly weaves the personalities and epiphanies of the scientists behind the papers into the book’s narrative and brings the reader along for the ride. Full review on my blog, here."

I liked the author's ""voice"" a lot, especially in the epilogue. I'm a huge animal lover, so it's always hard for me to read about humans hunting entire species to existence. While those kinds of examples were in here, this book also gave us many examples of the circle of life being more complex than we realize, and how just one species attacking another causes a ripple effect throughout the environment. I especially liked the chapters on the killer whales, the deer, and the wolves, and it makes me sad that there doesn't seem to be a happy ending in sight for many animals."
71,1596912995,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46092811-jennifer,4,"This intriguing book tells the story of what happens to ecosystems deprived of their natural predators. One of the most bizarre case studies was in Venezuela, on an island that had been artificially created when a large dam was completed. The island was too small to sustain a population of predators, so over time they all disappeared. Lago Guri ended up becoming the rain forest from hell - complete with poisonous plants, tree-killing vines, and a population of sociopathic monkeys living in trees nearly stripped bare by ants. Apparently that's what happens in a world without jaguars and armadillos.  I can definitely say that after reading this book I will never see carnivores in quite the same way again."

It is an issue I have little thought of, but much of the scientific discovery seems perfectly obvious in hindsight. I think some of the suggestions for repairing the loss were clearly passions of the author, and I don't know that the practical (and not just kneejerk) objections were deftly handled. But all in all, I think it is certainly something we as a culture should consider, as we must consider how we impact our environment with our reckless treatment and destruction of anything we don't understand."

Takes hard look at the fact that humans cannot really co-exist with large predators in their back yard. Although the author spend the majorty of the book laying out the dire consequences of the loss or the large predators he does not deny that people cannot have their kids playing outiside if lions, for example, were patrolling their neighborhoods.

So scary to think what could become of this world without our top predators, and to see it already happening. So many things you just don't think about that are a chain reaction to losing our top predators in the wild. And not just top predators, but smaller ""keystone"" predators. An entire ecosystem has been shown to have been changed by a starfish and another by an otter. While very scientific in nature, the author writes in a way so that us laypeople can still understand.

The main theme is that in many ecological systems it is the apex predators that create the diversity of organisms by preventing the most promiscuous organisms from lower down the scale from creating monocultures. This book gave me the ability to look at ecosystems from a top-down perspective rather than, as a plant-person, from a bottom-up perspective."

The book presents what is technically dense and technical information in a social/narrative context without insulting the readers intelligence by dumbing everything down (instead choosing to give a historical approach to the development of the concept so you have the tools to understand what is being talked about). I think the conclusion kinda tails off but the information is so solid i am like very onboard that this is an important book for green/enviro folx to read.

In such a view, the absence of top/large predatots changes the biodiversity of an area. The most relevant creature would be the wolf and its history of predatory behavior. When wolves were removed from Yellowstone Park, the hoofed mammals such as deer and elk run rampant thus causing the ecosystem to support a larger number feeding on saplings and eating bark from trees in order to survive. Thus plants, birds, insects, and other fauna become scarcer because the food cycle has been dramatically changed."

The studies included span fifty years, and make for provocative reading. The book is compelling reading from start to finish for anyone concerned about what kind of environment we are creating for the future. "

This book expounds an interesting premise: that the disappearance and suppression of apex predators ultimately destroy our ecosystems. Examples put forth in support include pronghorns/cheetahs. I believe he's got a good point. My rating: 7/10, finished 7/2010."
98,1596912995,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4887565-aaron,5,"Fantastic! For the naturalist and anyone going into non-medical biology. This book sits next to ""Silent Spring"" on my shelf at home. An unconventional view of the big, fierce animals of the world and an account of their decline in the shadow of the human population. Is there still hope for the megapredators of the world? This book may open your eyes and show you why they are still vital to our existence."
99,1596912995,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4356381-troy,3,"A good, but short, book about the role of predators in the natural environment. This book stresses the importance of having a predator-populated ecosystem for the sake of environmental health and biodiversity. An ecosystem missing a predator population often cascades into an unsustainable situation with a lack of biodiversity and an overabundance of herbivores. I thought the book presented the argument well and illustrated some great examples. In general, the book was a good read. "
100,1596912995,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22819871-cody,5,"I can't even express how much I wish everyone would read this book. It's predator conservation science written by a journalist, so it reads like a good science magazine article. It's chock full of interesting facts from the most knowledgeable sources (the bibliography is literally 47 pages). The disappearance of top predators can and will affect everyone, so I'd gladly recommend this to readers of all kinds."
101,1596912995,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2606737-alex,3,"Good overview (tho anecdotal) of the current state of animal ecology in North America. The book makes the point that w/o the large predators at the top of our food chain, wildlife diversity disproportionately shrinks. It gets repetitive at times, but is def worth a library check out (or borrow it from me!). I found it remainder at University Bookstore for $7."
102,1596912995,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1362758-paige4015,4,"Well-researched and borderline heavy on the science, Where the Wild Things Were nonetheless remains an engaging, enlightening look at the world around us. It puts forth an intriguing, unusual hypothesis about the importance of ""keystone"" predators to thier respective ecosystems. A very thought-provoking read, even for those of us with no background in the subject at hand. Very enjoyable."
103,1596912995,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1593101-rosanna,4,"Very informative, a bit depressing, as all environmental subjects tend to be :( But it really made a case for the need for biodiversity and with that, the need for public support and understanding of the above mentioned biodiversity; support which is difficult, nearly impossible to attain because we so naturally fear predatory animals. Such a challenge it is for us to be kind to our environment!"
104,1596912995,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3372766-nathan-beers,5,Great environmental book that does not focus on espousing the evils of western culture and capitalistic economies. Instead it presents the extremely important role that top predators play in promoting healthy ecological systems and shows how our often irrational fear of these predators has injured our environment and in many ways made us more at risk.
105,1596912995,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4930019-sara,4,I really enjoyed this book - it was all about trophic collapse and what happens to the environment when the predators are removed and the cascade effect it has. The study on sea otters in the Aleutian islands was the most fascinating by far. My only wish was that the author had talked more globally and not just focused on north and south America. 
106,1596912995,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10171201-e-c-frey,5,"This is a beautifully written and insightful look at how human actions can and have adversely impacted the natural world. The government no longer puts a bounty on wolves, but its policies have barely changed. Man continues to seek to control his environment and, in seeking that control, he throws the natural world into chaos. Balance requires the predator."
107,1596912995,http://goodreads.com/user/show/936861-megs,3,"Got a little slow at times, but overall the message of a middle-heavy ecosystem is important. The author makes a strong case without getting too starry-eyed about re-introducing top predators. Also, an interesting historical look at how we ended up with those top predator shortages to begin with."
108,1596912995,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19446286-elentarri,4,"Very interesting ecology book focusing on the effects of big predators - their removal and re-introduction. There isn't much to say that hasn't been said in previous reviews. The writing style is personable and not overly technical, but doesn't dumb down the subject at all. Minus one star for failing to include any sort of diagrams for important concepts - it is a missed opportunity."

114,1596912995,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1073025-megan,3,Very interesting. It is amazing the consequences of man and the trickle impact we have made on wildlife and the environment. Even knowing the harmful impacts we have made on nature we are still trying to change things (sometimes for the better but many times for the worse). 
115,1596912995,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2052350-mickey,4,Stolzenburg did a great job with this book. It was well written and addressed the issue of disappearing predators very well. I recommend this book to anyone who like animals and enjoys reading about the world today.

What the author has done is given us real, classic text book examples of the breakdown of ecological communities when they are disrupted by the removal of key predators. Truthfully, this book should be required reading for every undergrad in the biological and ecological sciences. If you are going to try to affect changes to restore health to a failing community, you have to correctly assess the missing piece[s]. This book gives you a great look into the importance of the predator's role within ecological communities. "
