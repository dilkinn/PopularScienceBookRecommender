0,0307394913,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72305-britt,2,"This book did have a lot of interesting bits of information in it, but I don’t feel like it succeeded in its goal. We were to learn the truth about so many things about which we have been misinformed. I didn’t find that I actually had the incorrect knowledge on most of this. I think a lot of what they did was argue semantics or just phrase things in tricky ways. For instance, we were properly informed about the highest v. tallest mountain, so Everest would not have been the answer they were looking for. Tricked ya! It might be the highest but it’s not the tallest! Yes, ok, didn’t we actually learn that in like 8th grade or somewhere thereabout? Or how about there are actually only 46 states and 4 commonwealths. Really? I mean, this has almost no bearing on anything, so who but those who want to trick people with these questions actually cares?There were a few questions that relied on only 1 study to contradict what people commonly believe on a topic, or what other studies have concluded. An example of this would be the question on how much sleep people actually need. Why should I believe this study over other studies?I’m also dubious as to the accuracy of many of their answers. Some of the questions didn’t even have real answers, they just threw around commonly held theories such as on the origins of the Hokey-Pokey. Or word origins, we know how easy those can be to track. Wasn’t the point to discount the common myths and provide us with truth?I had a major issue with the fact that they had a book filled with information purporting to be corrections to common misconceptions, but there was no bibliography or footnotes or anything to tell us where they got most of this information. Guess what? I can contradict most commonly held beliefs by looking for information on the Most Reliable and All-Knowing Internet. So why should I believe any of this if they don’t even tell us where they found their super special knowledge?I know this book was meant to be fun, and a lot of it was, but there are just some standards that should always be met when you want someone to accept as truth the information you are sharing. Otherwise, all you’re doing is adding to the common misconceptions."
1,0307394913,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2142739-malak-alrashed,4,"*The book is inspired by a BBC comedy quiz show. Go to YouTube and watch it! It's funny. How much you think you know? And even if you think you know enough information, do you think all of them are true?This is what the book is about; it corrects the misconceptions that everyone thinks they're true basically because they are ""a common knowledge"". There are so many things that will shock you and make you wonder how much we really know? And, most importantly, how much of it is true?I loved getting to know that Mount Everest isn't really the tallest mountain on earth, it is the Mauna Kea it's 10,000 m (33,000 ft) tall while Mount Everest is 8,848 metres (29,029 ft). Another thing that I liked is that piece of information about the driest place on earth, do you know that the driest place on earth is Antarctica and it's considered as a desert? Some of the continent parts have seen no rain since two million years (desert defined as a place that receives less than 25mm of rain a year) o_o!I found it entertaining to read this book because it's comprehensive; you can find information about anything and everything in it: animals, science, sports and places which all are divided to questions and then followed by a paragraph answering the Q. You may find ""some"" silly things, things that you think are not important to know, but generally the book is good, light and simply written. I only wished it contained a source of the informations that are mentioned. "
2,0307394913,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2649865-lolly-s-library,4,"I may not be the next Ken Jennings upon finishing this book, but it's possible I could stand a reasonable chance to win a few bucks should I ever appear on a trivia-based game show. Short, witty, and cleverishly devil- wait, that's not right. Whatever. The Book of General Ignorance is a perfect book to test the contents of your brain to see what floats...and if it floats, it should be flushed. (Too gross an analogy? Sorry.) To be honest, since I have a trivial brain (and, yes, I mean every word of that), I actually knew quite a few of the tidbits presented within the book, although if someone had asked me to name them directly, the most intelligible answer they would've received would've been something along the lines of, ""Um, wait, I know who/what/where/when that is, I just can't quite remember. I definitely know it's not who/what/where/when you think it is. Give me a minute, 'kay?"" (At least that's a more coherent response than if I actually did appear on a game show; with the glare of the bright lights and glittering eyes of a studio audience, I would be reduced to a quivering mass unable to say anything more than ""Durumdedumyoupdedoodleedoododulawhat?"" Or something equivalent.) However, there were enough surprises sprinkled throughout the entries to have me gasping out a ""No way!"" every few pages.For a quick read or as something to scan in between reading projects, The Book of General Knowledge is a perfect book for that most entertaining of past-times, that of stuffing your brain with useless information (and risking the possibility of losing important information along the way) just to whip out said trivia to entertain your friends. Hey, it makes for great fun at parties! Especially when you start drooling and can't remember your own name...but at least you know how many penises a European earwig has. (Curious to know how many too? Read the book to find out!)"
3,0307394913,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1758594-patrick-gibson,3,"What's the tallest mountain in the world? Think you know right, Mount Everest, at 29,029 feet? Nope, it is Mauna Kea. Though it is a modest 13,799 above sea level, measured from its seabed base to its summit, it is a whopping 33,465 feet in height, almost three-quarters of a mile higher than Mount Everest. What's the driest place in the world? The Sahara right? It is dry alright, getting just one inch of rain a year but it is the third driest place on Earth. The driest in fact is Antarctica, as some areas of the continent have not seen rain for two million years. The second driest is the Atacama Desert in Chile, which averages 0.004 inch of rain a year, and some areas have not seen rain for four hundred years. You have been told that Eskimo is a rude term right, that the preferred term now is Inuit? True, Inuit is the preferred term in Canada, but Alaskan Eskimos are perfectly happy with the name as they ""are emphatically not Inuit, a people who live mainly in northern Canada and parts of Greenland."" In fact there are many types of Eskimo, of which the Inuit are just one type (the others include the Kalaallit of Greenland and the Yupiget and the Alutiit of Alaska). Think the first turkeys eaten by English-speaking peoples were the Pilgrims? Nope, Turkeys first reached Europe in the 1520s, brought from their native Mexico by Spain and sold throughout Europe by Turkish merchants, by 1585 becoming a Christmas tradition in England. Perhaps you have heard that chop suey is actually an American dish. Not so, according to this book, it is a local dish of southern Canton, where it is called tsap seui, which means ""miscellaneous scraps"" in Cantonese, brought over by early Chinese immigrants to California. How many states of matter? Three right, solid, liquid, and gas? Nope, more like fifteen, as the list includes such states as plasma, superfluid, degenerate matter, fermionic condensate, Bose-Einstein condensate, and strange matter. Others questions and answers deal with just plain odd things that I didn't know. Croatia for instance gave the world the necktie, as Hravat is the Croation word for ""Croat"" and where the word cravat comes from. In the 17th century, Louis XIII of France kept a regiment of Croatian mercenaries during the Thirty Years War who as part of their uniform wore a wide, brightly colored neck cloth by which they became known, a style that was later much copied in Paris. St. Bernard dogs have never, ever carried barrels of brandy around their neck; the myth comes from an 1831 painting by a young English artist named Sir Edwin Landseer, who in his work ‘Alpine Mastiffs Reanimating a Distressed Traveler’ painted two St. Bernards, one with a miniature brandy barrel around its neck which he added ""for interest."" ‘Ursus arctos’ is not the scientific name for the polar bear, it is the name for the brown bear, as ursus is Latin for bear and arctos is Greek for bear. The Arctic, interestingly enough, is named after the bear, not the other way around, as it is ""the region of the bear."" I have only one complaint about the book. Though it does include a helpful index, it lacks any mention of sources. Though not presented a serious scholarly work but merely a fun book to read, it might have nice to include some list of references."

(I highly recommend the Mannequin Bird clip, and the Parthenon clip. These two made me cry with laughter) Stephen Fry is a delight to watch, Allen Davies is hysterical, and many of the guests add unexpected wit. Series regular Bill Bailey (who is also a regular on Nevermind The Buzzcocks, a similar show about pop music) stands out amongst the many other outstanding guests.What does this have to do with ""The Book of General Ignorance?"" Well first, those two ugly characters on the front of the book are badly done drawings of Fry and Davies. And second, many of the questions from the show's General Ignorance part of the episodes, are in this book. Its a collection of the most random tidbits of knowledge you probably think you know, but don't.This is the kind of book you take on a long road trip with your family, to entertain everyone as you drive. It might even pair well with an edition of Trivial Pursuit, though I suspect a few of the answers may contradict eachother. Its up to you to decide which one is correct."

I got interested in this because I want something light to read as I was reading a lot and need some space and this book is an excellent idea to do that.As of the content of the book it’s targeting the Native English speaking community misconceptions so if you are not native you might not have these misconceptions In general:- Con:-	It target English speaking community.-	There are errors in some of the info they introduce.-	They introduce a lot of boring and unnecessary stuff regarding the Question they answer.-	Some of the items are theoretical unproven answers.-	No citation for references and sources. -	Some time all they did was argue semantics.-	There are a lot of old news kind of Info-	Not that funny.+ Pro:-	It sure gives you the space to read slowly since the info take from 1 to 3 pages only.-	It gives you the necessary motive to go a check the info from more reliable sources.-	There some fascinating and interesting information I think 2/5 is fare assessment for such book.
6,0307394913,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1376766-becky,3,"This was an interesting book full of trivia that nobody knows. Now if only I had friends geeky enough to quote it at. :DI didn't really find this all that humorous, except for the one bit towards the end about the theory of the wise man visiting Jesus who put off getting a gift for the savior until too late and the shops were closed, so had to go halfsies on the frankincense. I giggled at that. I probably would have rated this higher had I read it instead of listening to the audio. The authors, John Lloyd and John Mitchinson, read this one, and while they didn't do nearly as badly as some authors I've listened to, I found them to be a bit boring. One of the Johns has a quite raspy/gravelly voice, and I kept hoping for someone to get him a glass of water or a lozenge or something. Then there were the accents given to quoted materials, which were... well, just not good. I say it in almost every time I review an audiobook: Please stop doing voices. It is not necessary, and almost never adds to the performance. I'd rather the reader err on the side of too subtle than too much. But, nonetheless, a good book full of interesting stuff. Recommended.

Well, at least according to the authors of this excellent ""stout book"".Leafing through the volume just doesn't work because as soon as you start to read a snippet, you become totally engrossed and find yourself reading compulsively on.Never mind that the new views are somewhat skewed, the information about every point is fascinating and absorbing.

This is one of the better efforts in the genre, a little more erudite than some. The format is essentially this:""Here's a piece of trivia you thought you knew. But you're wrong, there's more to it than that. And while we're on the topic, here are a few more facts and observations that are sort of related to the original subject but perhaps not so much.""You'll learn, among other things, that Henry VIII technically had only two wives, that marmots are the most deadly mammals humans have ever encountered, and that bees were the first animals to ""realize"" that the earth is round. All in all, a useful resource for debunking those who presume to have knowledge of trivia that is superior to yours. "

The book isn't as funny, most of the time, but it does succeed in being Quite Interesting.It covers a lot of facts I've read elsewhere in other books (some of which I suspect of taking their topics at least from here, if not the text) and a lot that I've never read elsewhere.

I love trivia (cue me spending hours on Cracked.com). I especially love strange trivia. Penis trivia? Booyah!This book was easy to get through too - one can pick it up at any point again to discover something new about the universe. I'm a huge fan of the TV series QI.

18,0307394913,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22237926-felicia,1,"Before I start, let me say that I have a Master of Science degree in Paleontology, a Bachelor of Science in Biochemistry, and a Bachelor of Science in Ecology & Evolution.Some things wrong in this book:1. [page 58] The three-toed sloth and the two-toed sloth are related to each other. Saying they are not means that the author has a misunderstanding of phylogenetics. They are sister taxa, meaning that they are more closely related to each other than they are to their next closest extant relative (anteaters). They are also more closely related to each other than to any other taxon. Therefore the two types of sloth are related. To say they are not just because their skeletal anatomy is different is grossly negligent [a side note: they say that the two-toed has 6 cervical (neck) vertebrae. It does, but only because three are fused together. Sloths are xenarthrans. This means they belong to a group of mammals that have weird fusions in their skeleton. Most xenarthrans have fused tibiae and fibulae, a heavily fused pelvis (called a synsacrum), and fused cervical vertebrae.]. A tinamou and a swan have different skeletal anatomy (the swan has many more vertebrae than the tinamou and there are different bones fused in the swan's pelvis compared to the tinamou) but I'm not sure who would say they aren't related. (Source: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/artic... Figure 1: Bradypus (three-toed) and Choloepus (two-toed) are sister taxa)2. [page 62] ""Most other mammals"" do not have baculi (penis bones). The authors state that whales and ""most other mammals"" have them. Nope. Baculi are found in Primates (minus humans), Rodentia (mice, rats, squirrels, gophers, porcupines, beavers), Insectivora (shrews, moles, hedgehogs), Chiroptera (bats), Carnivora (dogs, cats, raccoons, weasels, mongooses, hyenas, bears, seals, walruses), and Lagamorphs (rabbits, hares, pikas; although this was discovered in 2014). The baculum is not found in Edentata (anteaters, sloths, armadillos), Pholidota (pangolins), Macroscelidae (elephant shrews), Scandentia (tree shrews), Dermoptera (colugos or flying lemurs), Artiodactyla (pigs, deer, cattle, goats, sheep, hippos, camels), Cetacea (whales, dolphins, porpoises), Tubulidentata (aardvark), Perissodactyla (horses, tapirs, rhinos), Hyracoidea (hyraxes, dassies), Sirenia (manatees, dugong, sea cows), and Proboscidea (elephants, mammoths, mastodons). There are several extinct clades of eutherian mammals that also lack baculi (Creodonta, Condylarthra, Desmostylia, and Embrythopoda).Most eutherian (placental) mammals do not have baculi. 3. [page 63] Rhino horns do leave evidence of their existence on rhino skulls. Yes, there is no stub of bone protruding from the nasal bones on the skull, but the nasals have thickened, rough bone marking the base of the horn. This is an indication that some sort of soft tissue sits there. 4. [page 121] Humans did evolve from apes. This is another instance where the author does not have an understanding of phylogenetics. The sentence in question reads as such, ""This creature [what humans evolved from] descended from squirrel-like tree-shrews, which in turn evolved from hedgehogs, and before that, starfish."" HOLY MOTHER OF GOD. The fallacies in that sentence. That sentence implies that we know direct ancestry. In paleontology under the phylogenetics framework, it is not possible to know that one species directly led to another and so on. It is not possible to know that the population of fossil specimens you just found is the ancestral population that led to another species. There is nothing that differentiates that population from another found, say, 10 miles away as being the ancestral population. Another sentence: ""The latest comparison [the book was published in 2006] of genomes of humans and our closest relative, the chimpanzee, shows that we split much later than was previously assumed. This means we quite possibly interbred to produce unrecorded and now extinct hybrid species before the final separation 5.4 million years ago."" A few things here. What is a ""hybrid species""? I have three science degrees including a Masters in Paleontology. I have never heard of this. If it is different enough to be called a species, then call it such. Also, the authors clearly have not heard of ghost lineages. A ghost lineage exists when a divergence dating analysis puts the date of speciation (divergence) before the age of the oldest known fossils from either of the resulting lineages (species). The time between the divergence date and when the first fossils show up is the ghost lineage. Paleontologists might not find the fossils in this period of time for a number of reasons. The area where the fossils should be found may not have any sediments (rocks) dating from that time. Maybe they were deposited but then the environment changed and they were eroded away. Maybe they were never deposited in the first place: during the time in question, the environment was erosional rather than depositional. In erosional environments, nothing can fossilize. Fossilization can only happen in depositional environments where the dead can be quickly buried and stay covered. Another reason why we may not have found the fossils in the ghost lineage is that we may not have searched all of the sediment dating from that time. Which just means we need to go searching some more. Another thing wrong in the last sentence I quoted: If the supposed ""hybrid species"" are unrecorded, absence of evidence is evidence of absence. You can't just go making them up if there is not evidence that they ever existed. 5. [page 127] Maybe its use is waning in the UK, but the Bunsen burner is going strong in the US. So to say that it has largely been replaced by the hot plate is false. As a biochemistry major in undergrad, I can assure you that there are some experiments in high school and college that can only be done with the heat of an open flame. In high school, I remember being tested multiple times on my ability to start a Bunsen burner and keep it going.6. [page 149] The author states that because the Doberman pinscher was created as a breed in 35 years, this ""flies in the face of the Darwinian evolution of species, a process thought to operate over thousands or even millions of years."" 1) A Doberman is not a different species of animal than the animals that the breed was created from. All are dogs. The same species. 2) The process of Darwinian evolution of species takes a long time in nature, when it is not influenced by humans. The creation of dog breeds is an example of artificial evolution, in which the creation of new breeds or sometimes species is often accelerated. -Because of the blatant conflation of ""breed"" and ""species"", I am subtracting one star from my rating. Originally, I was going to give this book 2/5. Now it gets 1/5. If I could give it 0 stars, I would.I really thought QI was better at science than this. These errors are disgraceful. Additionally, I don't like that some of the facts are repeated. A question will be asked and in the answer, the authors will mention the answer to another question that is asked later. I also don't like how pedantic some of the questions are, as if they are written with the purpose of tricking you based on the wording.I have to say that in the end, I regret reading this. As someone with three science degrees, I found that I already knew a third to a half of this book. Additionally, my view of QI and the books that spawn from it is much less favorable considering how horrible they were at explaining some aspects of science in this book. I understand that they are trying to explain complex subjects such that everyone could understand them. However, especially when it comes to anything having to do with evolution, they either didn't care, didn't understand themselves, intentionally got it wrong, or simplified it too much because all of their explanations in this field of science are wrong."
19,0307394913,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24438263-al,3,"The Book of General Ignorance purports that everything you know is wrong which means its either because we have longtime cultural memes (like cannibals cooking people in big pots) or technically true (Mauna Kea in Hawaii is taller than Everest from base to tip but starts under sea level) or just unlikely (the most dangerous animal is the mosquito).So, there's things like Loofahs aren't Sponges, Cashews aren't nuts, Chameleons don't change their color to match their background and moths aren't attracted to light. All stuff that won't make you a better husband, more productive at work, or get you into college, but the type of things you might talk about at the right type of parties.I grew up on The Book Of Lists and I love this type of stuff. In 2018, the internet is powered by this kind of stuff because it makes for the best clickbait on social media. So, I give credit that most of the book is filled with stuff that I wouldn't probably know. Also, each question/answer is about 3/4 page of long. This is the perfect size to give the answer and then move on- not too short but not too long. It also is a relatively short book but doesn't ""feel"" short. The book is based off the British Show QI, which I wasn't familiar with, and although it has a British slant, there were maybe only a couple of times where I might have missed the reference. It seemed to be written for an universal audience.As far as these books go, it does a good job. It is 'bathroom reader' style material, but that's a good thing. Recommended for those who think similarly."
20,0307394913,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5069149-scott-klemm,3,"John Lloyd and John Mitchinson’s book, The Book of General Ignorance, is an interesting collection of trivia. The subtitle on the book’s jacket says “Everything you think you know is wrong.” Each entry, a short page or page and a half, discusses some popular misconception covering such fields as history, botany, zoology, physics, geology, medicine, sports, etc. Some previous reviews have mentioned the lack of documentation. Undoubtedly, the vast array of topics would require endnotes nearly as long as the text itself. In general, the book appears to be well researched and reliable. However, no one can be an expert in every field of knowledge, and Lloyd and Mitchinson are not infallible.  On page 63, the authors state, “Rhinos are the only animal to have a horn that is entirely made from keratin; unlike those of cattle, sheep, antelopes, and giraffes, they don’t have any bone core.” Neither do giraffes. Giraffe “horns” are actually ossicones derived from ossified cartilage and covered with skin and fur.  On page 74 it is stated that “Nero also invented ice cream (runners brought mountain snow flavored with fruit juice) …” You cannot have ice cream without cream. Fruit flavored ice would be what Americans would call a snow cone.In the discussion of Julius Caesar (p. 78), the authors tell us that “Romans pronounced ‘Caesar’ as kaiser (which is still the German word for ‘king’ …).” Wrong. The German word for king is koenig. Kaiser means emperor.On page 243, it’s alleged that the biblical story of Jesus’ virgin birth was the result of Christianity absorbing “pagan ideas to broaden its appeal.” The authors assert that “Perseus and Dionysus in Greek mythology, Horus in Egyptian and Mithra, a Persian deity whose cult rivaled Christianity in popularity, were all ‘born of virgins.’” Wrong again. Perseus was born of Zeus and Danae, Dionysus of Zeus and Semele, Horus of Osiris and Isis, and Mithra from a rock. Was Adolf Hitler a good Catholic? You would think so according to this book. To support their contention, the authors provide a 1928 quote from Hitler in which he said, “I am now, as before, a Catholic and will always remain so” (p. 194). At this point in time Hitler had not acquired full power and could not afford to alienate a large segment of the population. His real opinion is revealed in Hitler’s Table Talk, a collection of his private conversations compiled by a close aid during the war years. In it he calls Christianity one of the great “scourges” of history, and blamed the Jews for inventing Christianity."

It’s mostly quite interesting, I’ll give it that. I’ll also give it that it’s an infuriatingly pointless, and often times smug, self-satisfied book that even the most uptight Brit would surely be annoyed with. We all know the show QI, hosted by Stephen Fry and other comedians. It’s a funny, very entertaining show, mostly because it doesn’t condescend to the audience, and the panel members give the sometimes crazy factoids a balance, by cracking jokes and not taking things too seriously. That’s why the show works. In book form, I don’t think the success of the show really translates all that well. I can’t very well say that The Book of General Ignorance is a bad or horrendous book, just that it’s not so much a book, as a transcription of the show, a failed transcription at that. It’s just it’s all so very serious, all the facts, everything is written in such a stern, you-know-I’m-right kind of way that it really started grating on me by the last quarter of the book, at which point I put it down and didn’t want to read any more of it. Take this question/answer (the entire book is presented in this way) for example:Which of the following are nuts?a) Almond b) Peanutc) Brazil Nut d) WalnutNuts are defined as a simple, dry fruit with one seed (very occasionally two) in which the seed-case wall becomes very hard at maturity. Tree nuts include walnuts, butternuts, hickory, pecan, chestnut (but not conkers), beech, oak acorns, tan oak, hazel, filbert, hornbeam, birch and elder. Peanuts, almonds, pistachios, Brazils, cashews, coconuts, horse chestnuts and pine nuts are not nuts. Pretty entertaining stuff … Not! "

The front jacket matter includes the following comment that lays out the essence of this work: ""Misconceptions, misunderstandings, and flawed facts finally get the heave-ho in this humorous, downright humiliating book of reeducation based on the phenomenal British best-seller."" But the best way to give an idea of what this book is about is to lay out some of the questions and answers. Just enough to pique one's interest!""Who said 'Let them eat cake'""? It was NOT Marie Antoinetts according to this book. First, it was not cake being referred to, it was brioche, a different thing entirely. Second, the philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau claims to have heard the line in 1740.Here's a new one for me (among others): ""What Edison invention do English speakers use every day?"" (Page 131-132) According to the book (and this is one on me), the word ""Hello"" was an Edisonian invention. ""What was Mozart's middle name""? Wolfgang. According to the book, his full name was actually Johann Chyrstomus Wolfgangus Theophilus Mozart. ""What is the first invention to break the sound barrier""? The whip!I don't know if all the answers to the questions posed are correct, but it's quite enjoyable to run through the questions and test your knowledge against the answers provided in the book. "
24,0307394913,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12157877-alex-jurado,4,"I choose this book because it tells you the common mistakes people make when answering common questions you think you know the answer too. I find this book interesting because this tells me what to answer to people if they have a question like, ""Where is the driest place on earth?' The answer to that question is Antartica. I thought it was the Sahara desert. It also makes me look smart. This book does not have a particular plot, other than to inform people. My favorite quote from this book is that, ""Half the human beings who have ever died, perhaps as many as 45 billion people, have been killed by female mosquitoes."" I thought that the great white shark or a lion was ""the most dangerous animal that has ever lived."" I think the authors' writing style are loose and relaxed, meaning that they just write without any purpose. The book is written in a 3rd person point of view. I would recommend this book to people who enjoy informational books and would like to know about 230 new and interesting facts. "
25,0307394913,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5971941-kendra,5,"I love, love, LOVE this book! My kids and I have had a fabulous time finding out how wrong we have been about so many things, and it has come to be a matter of celebration when we manage to answer a question correctly. Who knew a chicken could live for about two years without its head? It makes sense that the healing properties of we call penicillin were discovered a very long time before Fleming. And I have to say that the truth behind the invention of the telephone came as quite a shock! As a final note, I'm more than a little disturbed that some reviewers have knocked this book because of its British perspective. Seriously? This is a problem for you? We Americans (or U.S.-Americans or United Statesians) are already far too provincial, and this attitude doesn't help. I've never met anyone who couldn't stand to broaden his or her horizons quite a bit, myself included.This book now lives on a kitchen bookshelf with the dictionaries and the cookbooks."

What this noticeably stouter version will tell you is that weird habits, behaviours and solid facts we all know are wrong and misreported. How is that not wonderful. There are so many little things that are technically correct or technically untrue. And also everything you know is wrong to some degree, simple as that.I mean who knew that technically Henry VIII only had two wives. I mean really. There are no muscles in your fingers and again, technically coffee isn't made from a bean. So many fun facts that can change how you see the world. From the butterscotch Mars to the fact we are still living in the ice age. There are a bunch more in the QI book series and I implore you all to go find them all and absorb all their knowledgey goodness. Now! Go! Do it!"
27,0307394913,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64078-richard,4,"John Lloyd, one of the co-authors of this book seems to specialise in slightly frothy, snippet based books which can be read in tiny bite sized pieces (I refer the reader to The Meaning of Liff with Douglas Adams). In this case the book is a series of questions, many of which you probably think you know the answer to, but which you are then disavowed of.For instance, what is the 'Ring a-ring a-Roses' about.I, like most people thought it was about the Black Death (Bubonic Plague). But it dates back much further than that and its genesis has been lost in the mists of time. "
28,0307394913,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5397595-peter-wolfley,4,I love/hate books like this because on one hand you get your mind blown on every page and then on the other hand your entire universe is shattered because you start thinking every thing you ever knew is wrong. Some of the gems include who is America really named after? Baseball wasn't invited in the United States. The earth has more than one moon. And many more amazing things that you can use to annoy strangers at parties and alienate all of your friends by correcting them in casual conversation.

I got it because I like Stephen Fry's QI show and I saw he had written the foreword (Alan Davies wrote a ""four word"", the guy's hilarious). It took me about four months to get through it, I could never read more than 10 or 15 pages at once because there's just too much information... so I kept it as my backup book to read when I had nothing else to occupy myself with. I guess it's more of a ""reference"" book, if anything, but then again it does go off on tangents within the same topic which makes it difficult to follow."

44,0307394913,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4176122-stuart-aken,5,"Subtitled ‘The Noticeably Stouter Edition’, this book of humorously presented erudition is a gem. Clearly, a book to be dipped into, rather than read at one sitting, it is nevertheless addictive.Those who know the TV show, first hosted by the inimitable Stephen Fry and latterly by the equally unique Sandie Toksvig, along with the intelligent but willing fall guy, Alan Davies, will be aware of the nature of the humour and eclectic content. For those who haven’t had this pleasure, this UK TV show presents facts in the form of alphabetised chunks of knowledge and sets questions intended to trap the panel of celebrity quiz contestants. Like no other quiz programme I know, it entertains, informs and educates whilst anarchic humour has the audience in stitches. The scoring system is understood by no one apart from the mischievous elves who research and set the questions.The final section of the show runs under the banner of ‘General Ignorance’ and aims to debunk those items of knowledge we all know but actually get wrong. And that is what this book is about.Today, society has probably never been more overcrowded with those who ‘know’ what they know, and who are desperate to shout their errors for the world to hear. One has only to listen to most leading politicians, led by their clown in command over the pond, to understand that information and facts are no longer the same things.This book sheds light onto those areas where we have all been misled, misinformed, or downright fooled. An example from the many given: Dan Brown’s ‘The Da Vinci Code’ encouraged the popular misconception about 5 million witches being burned at the stake during Europe’s witch hunts in the period of religious fanaticism from 1450 to 1750. In reality, the figure is closer to 40,000, and the vast majority were hanged rather than burnt. In England, only 200 such executions were recorded and a handful of these were burned. Most trials ended in acquittal, and the general public resisted the idea of witch-hunting, which they regarded as superstitious and prejudicial to public order.And one other: How many commandments in the Bible? Why, ten, of course! Wrong! There are at least 613, many of them ludicrous.Just two of hundreds of examples of misinformation spread by the prejudiced, the ignorant, the foolish and those who would control us, if we allow them. Topics cover a wide swathe of subjects including animals, geography, science, mechanics, religion, celebrity, history and so many others.If, like me, you’re entertained by words and facts, you crave the truth but prefer not be lectured, and you appreciate witty humour, this book is for you. I finished it off in the restricted public of a small hospital ward and my occasional bursts of laughter intrigued my fellow patients enough for them to want to read it."

The very British authors smartly destroy many commonly-accepted truths and build upon these revelations with sometimes wow-worthy related information and surprises.Their arguments generally seem quite solid, especially given they write in that convincing British way, yet they can be criticized for not providing a bibliography or a proper source list or referencing. I guess we just have to take the word of a British comedian and TV show writer. Moreover, a number of the shocking revelations are actually only slightly different from what most people thought, with many of those relying on semantic differences or petty trivialities.

This railway was in use until the 900s AD.- Page 21: Antonio Meucci, a Florentine inventor, invented the telephone but died poor in part because of Alexander Graham Bell- Page 23: Kilts, bagpipes, haggis, porridge, whisky and tartans do not originally come from Scotland- Page 59: Three-toed sloths are docile and have nine bones in their neck, two-toed sloths are vicious and have six.- Page 62: A blue whale's penis is 6 to 10 feet in length and around 18 inches in girth. A blue whale's ejaculate contains around 35 pints which come from its 150 pound-per-ball testes. Eskimos traditionally use whale penis-bones as runners for their sleds.- Pages 64-65: You don't mess with hippos. They kill more people than any other African animal not counting the mosquito. They drown lions, bite crocodiles in half and drag sharks out of the water and trample them to death. Their skin is a ton of 1.5 inch thick bulletproof armour. Hippos can easily outrun people. Hippos have massive teeth, powerful jaws, and can stay totally submerged underwater for five minutes at a time. They are also very defensive and violent when threatened.- Page 69: In 1942 BF Skinner came up with pigeon-guided missiles. The pigeons were trained to peck at the image of a ship. When launched they would peck more the closer they got to a ship and get more grain (reward) as well until they were showered with grain before blowing up.- Page 94: America is named after Richard Ameryk, a Bristol merchant and the chief investor in the second voyage of John Cabot.- Page 118: The Thule people of Greenland thought they were the only people on earth until the 19th century and built large ice palaces and massive igloos.- Page 122: The Andaman people are fascinating.

Spirulina, a form of cyanobacteria, is an incredible source of protein and healthy food, even fighting cancer, and it can be grown very sustainably in brackish water all while contributing tons of oxygen to the atmosphere.- Page 172: Tons of amazing honey bee facts.

But those are good too.Somehow adding to its pleasures are the surprises the reader gets when confronted with beliefs that s/he has long held to be true...yet they aren't. Why anyone should be happy to be proven wrong repeatedly is a mystery but the fact remains: it's fun to get contradicted and then corrected from some unsuspected direction.There are so many of these interesting short pieces that most readers will still forget them, regardless. It's fun while it lasts, though. And yes, you will learn who it was who famously identified squirrels as 'the Devil's oven mitts"". If that helps."

It was one of those books, that I categorized as ""has an interesting title and summary, buuuuuuuut I don't feel like reading it right now"". Then I had to spend some 8 hours in a Parisian train station, at night, after not having managed to sleep a wink the previous night... and Judassohn was proving to be much too difficult for my sleep-deprived brain; long story short, The Book of General Ignorance was the first ""friendly"" title I've stumbled on.There's not much to be said about the content, other than ""man I am so ignorant!"". It's basically a collection of facts that the vast majority of people get wrong, some with related ""FYI""s tacked on as a bonus.Given my above mentioned circumstances, it was interesting enough to keep me awake, make me feel bad about my ignorance aaaaaand make me feel somewhat better that I at least had heard of most things mentioned (even if my ""intel"" was woefully wrong).

But I don't particularly care as I enjoyed reading it and it's perfect for a piecemeal read of just a few pages here and there when you aren't feeling like reading anything else.Just be aware that the last 25% of the ebook is actually the index. I guess because ebooks don't use small print and columns like paper books do, that it expanded considerably when the book was converted to the electronic version. It's still a useful index though (even if the page numbers in it relate to the paper edition) since each page number is hyperlinked. You still end up where you were wanting to go.I don't know if it's appropriate to say in a public forum, but this is an excellent ""bathroom book"". Read a bit on each visit when you feel like it and over time you'll work your way through it. If you have a paper copy, leave it in there and your visitors can do the same.

I'm American but spend a lot of time in England, as that's where my husband lives atm. I think it is rather obvious the book was inspired by QI as Stephen Fry writes the Foreword, and most of the questions have appeared on the the show. This probably explains one reason this book is entertaining, full of knowledge and has a little something for everyone. It is definitely a ""must read"" if one were to ask me!The book is made up of a wide array of subjects, from historical figures to the universe all the way to insects and phrases. The vast majority of questions are very interesting, things many think they know but actually don't because our school system lets us down. Personally, two of my favorite questions were: ""Who invented the Theory of Relativity?"" and ""Who was the first American president?""

But other items are pretty interesting and really made me think. Like where did the saying ""let them eat cake!"" really come from. Not from where I always thought, according to this book.

Find out why in this fascinating, hard-to-put-down tome on 230 common misconceptions of the factual world…that is, if you dare to have your grade-school paradigms severely altered.

74,0307394913,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4176122-stuart-aken,5,"Subtitled ‘The Noticeably Stouter Edition’, this book of humorously presented erudition is a gem. Clearly, a book to be dipped into, rather than read at one sitting, it is nevertheless addictive.Those who know the TV show, first hosted by the inimitable Stephen Fry and latterly by the equally unique Sandie Toksvig, along with the intelligent but willing fall guy, Alan Davies, will be aware of the nature of the humour and eclectic content. For those who haven’t had this pleasure, this UK TV show presents facts in the form of alphabetised chunks of knowledge and sets questions intended to trap the panel of celebrity quiz contestants. Like no other quiz programme I know, it entertains, informs and educates whilst anarchic humour has the audience in stitches. The scoring system is understood by no one apart from the mischievous elves who research and set the questions.The final section of the show runs under the banner of ‘General Ignorance’ and aims to debunk those items of knowledge we all know but actually get wrong. And that is what this book is about.Today, society has probably never been more overcrowded with those who ‘know’ what they know, and who are desperate to shout their errors for the world to hear. One has only to listen to most leading politicians, led by their clown in command over the pond, to understand that information and facts are no longer the same things.This book sheds light onto those areas where we have all been misled, misinformed, or downright fooled. An example from the many given: Dan Brown’s ‘The Da Vinci Code’ encouraged the popular misconception about 5 million witches being burned at the stake during Europe’s witch hunts in the period of religious fanaticism from 1450 to 1750. In reality, the figure is closer to 40,000, and the vast majority were hanged rather than burnt. In England, only 200 such executions were recorded and a handful of these were burned. Most trials ended in acquittal, and the general public resisted the idea of witch-hunting, which they regarded as superstitious and prejudicial to public order.And one other: How many commandments in the Bible? Why, ten, of course! Wrong! There are at least 613, many of them ludicrous.Just two of hundreds of examples of misinformation spread by the prejudiced, the ignorant, the foolish and those who would control us, if we allow them. Topics cover a wide swathe of subjects including animals, geography, science, mechanics, religion, celebrity, history and so many others.If, like me, you’re entertained by words and facts, you crave the truth but prefer not be lectured, and you appreciate witty humour, this book is for you. I finished it off in the restricted public of a small hospital ward and my occasional bursts of laughter intrigued my fellow patients enough for them to want to read it."

The very British authors smartly destroy many commonly-accepted truths and build upon these revelations with sometimes wow-worthy related information and surprises.Their arguments generally seem quite solid, especially given they write in that convincing British way, yet they can be criticized for not providing a bibliography or a proper source list or referencing. I guess we just have to take the word of a British comedian and TV show writer. Moreover, a number of the shocking revelations are actually only slightly different from what most people thought, with many of those relying on semantic differences or petty trivialities. That said, overall I had a great time reading a few choice items before bed over a period of months, and mildly impressing some friends with my newfound temporarily-memorized knowledge!True Rating: 4.0 StarsChoice Factoids and Bits (Spoilers)- Page 18: Marco Polo was born in modern Croatia and his name means Mark Chicken in English (didn't clue in to this)- Page 20: Heron of Greece (around 62 AD) invented the first known steam engine, while Periander, tyrant of Corinth, had invented the railway which was called a Diolkos (slipway), and consisted of trolleys on rails used to transfer ships between the Ionian and Aegean seas. This railway was in use until the 900s AD.- Page 21: Antonio Meucci, a Florentine inventor, invented the telephone but died poor in part because of Alexander Graham Bell- Page 23: Kilts, bagpipes, haggis, porridge, whisky and tartans do not originally come from Scotland- Page 59: Three-toed sloths are docile and have nine bones in their neck, two-toed sloths are vicious and have six.- Page 62: A blue whale's penis is 6 to 10 feet in length and around 18 inches in girth. A blue whale's ejaculate contains around 35 pints which come from its 150 pound-per-ball testes. Eskimos traditionally use whale penis-bones as runners for their sleds.- Pages 64-65: You don't mess with hippos. They kill more people than any other African animal not counting the mosquito. They drown lions, bite crocodiles in half and drag sharks out of the water and trample them to death. Their skin is a ton of 1.5 inch thick bulletproof armour. Hippos can easily outrun people. Hippos have massive teeth, powerful jaws, and can stay totally submerged underwater for five minutes at a time. They are also very defensive and violent when threatened.- Page 69: In 1942 BF Skinner came up with pigeon-guided missiles. The pigeons were trained to peck at the image of a ship. When launched they would peck more the closer they got to a ship and get more grain (reward) as well until they were showered with grain before blowing up.- Page 94: America is named after Richard Ameryk, a Bristol merchant and the chief investor in the second voyage of John Cabot.- Page 118: The Thule people of Greenland thought they were the only people on earth until the 19th century and built large ice palaces and massive igloos.- Page 122: The Andaman people are fascinating. They never learned how to make fire and have kept the same fires burning for thousands of years by transporting embers.- Page 130: Amazonian Natives made boots out of liquid latex.- Page 133: Conan the Bacterium: a bacterium that can stand 1.5 million rads of radiation, doubling when frozen.- Page 138: The whip was the first invention to break the sound barrier. It was invented 7000 years ago in China.- Pages 141-142: Cats tend to survive falls higher than 7 stories, and in WWII an RAF tailgunner jumped out of his burning plane, fell 19 000 feet, hit a pine tree, then a snow bank and was unharmed.- Page 156: Most of the world's oxygen is produced by algae. Spirulina, a form of cyanobacteria, is an incredible source of protein and healthy food, even fighting cancer, and it can be grown very sustainably in brackish water all while contributing tons of oxygen to the atmosphere.- Page 172: Tons of amazing honey bee facts. Bees are highly-sensitive to the earth's magnetic field and a strong magnet placed next to a hive under construction causes them to make strange, cylindrical honeycombs. Bees evolved 150 million years ago, around the same time as flowering plants. IT TAKES THE ENTIRE LIFETIMES OF TWELVE BEES TO MAKE ENOUGH HONEY TO FILL A TEASPOON.- Page 175: Ants can survive for 19 days underwater and wood ants can live 24 days without their head. Ants are not abnormally strong. If humans were the same size as ants, they would be equally strong.- Page 178: Alcohol does not kill brain cells.- Page 206: In the original version of Roald Dahl's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory the Oompa-Loompas were described as a a tribe of three thousand black pygmies imported from ""the very deepest and darkest part of the African jungle where no white man had been before.""- Page 214: Coffee beans are actually the seeds of coffee fruit, which comes from the coffee tree, which is an evergreen tree that grows to twenty feet in the wild. It takes 2000 Arabica coffee seeds to make 1lb of coffee.- Page 217: Pistachios are classified internationally as flammable solids as they have a tendency to spontaneously combust if stacked under pressure.- Page 226: 19th Century Cannibals did not cook their victims in large metal pots because the technology to create said pots was unavailable to them until the 20th century.- Page 242: Despite the fact that turkeys were native to North America (Mexico), the US Pilgrims ate turkeys they had brought with them from England. Turkeys were brought back to Spain by the Spanish in the 1500s, then sold by Muslim merchants around Europe, eventually arriving in Norfolk in England, where farmers selectively bred them to produce large-breasted turkeys, which the Pilgrims put on their ships.- Page 245: The great flood found in many religious myths actually happened: humans evolved as the last ice age ended, and witnessed drowning land and floods of biblical proportions, which was part of the reason they switched to agriculture..."

But those are good too.Somehow adding to its pleasures are the surprises the reader gets when confronted with beliefs that s/he has long held to be true...yet they aren't. Why anyone should be happy to be proven wrong repeatedly is a mystery but the fact remains: it's fun to get contradicted and then corrected from some unsuspected direction.There are so many of these interesting short pieces that most readers will still forget them, regardless. It's fun while it lasts, though. And yes, you will learn who it was who famously identified squirrels as 'the Devil's oven mitts"". If that helps."

It was one of those books, that I categorized as ""has an interesting title and summary, buuuuuuuut I don't feel like reading it right now"". Then I had to spend some 8 hours in a Parisian train station, at night, after not having managed to sleep a wink the previous night... and Judassohn was proving to be much too difficult for my sleep-deprived brain; long story short, The Book of General Ignorance was the first ""friendly"" title I've stumbled on.There's not much to be said about the content, other than ""man I am so ignorant!"". It's basically a collection of facts that the vast majority of people get wrong, some with related ""FYI""s tacked on as a bonus.Given my above mentioned circumstances, it was interesting enough to keep me awake, make me feel bad about my ignorance aaaaaand make me feel somewhat better that I at least had heard of most things mentioned (even if my ""intel"" was woefully wrong).

But I don't particularly care as I enjoyed reading it and it's perfect for a piecemeal read of just a few pages here and there when you aren't feeling like reading anything else.Just be aware that the last 25% of the ebook is actually the index. I guess because ebooks don't use small print and columns like paper books do, that it expanded considerably when the book was converted to the electronic version. It's still a useful index though (even if the page numbers in it relate to the paper edition) since each page number is hyperlinked. You still end up where you were wanting to go.I don't know if it's appropriate to say in a public forum, but this is an excellent ""bathroom book"". Read a bit on each visit when you feel like it and over time you'll work your way through it. If you have a paper copy, leave it in there and your visitors can do the same.

I'm American but spend a lot of time in England, as that's where my husband lives atm.

This probably explains one reason this book is entertaining, full of knowledge and has a little something for everyone. It is definitely a ""must read"" if one were to ask me!The book is made up of a wide array of subjects, from historical figures to the universe all the way to insects and phrases. The vast majority of questions are very interesting, things many think they know but actually don't because our school system lets us down. Personally, two of my favorite questions were: ""Who invented the Theory of Relativity?"" and ""Who was the first American president?"" Each ""question & answer"" is brief, giving concise information so the reader learns something new yet isn't swamped by the knowledge and instead can use this 'starter info' for further research on said topic, if one desires.

Clearly, a book to be dipped into, rather than read at one sitting, it is nevertheless addictive.Those who know the TV show, first hosted by the inimitable Stephen Fry and latterly by the equally unique Sandie Toksvig, along with the intelligent but willing fall guy, Alan Davies, will be aware of the nature of the humour and eclectic content. For those who haven’t had this pleasure, this UK TV show presents facts in the form of alphabetised chunks of knowledge and sets questions intended to trap the panel of celebrity quiz contestants. Like no other quiz programme I know, it entertains, informs and educates whilst anarchic humour has the audience in stitches. The scoring system is understood by no one apart from the mischievous elves who research and set the questions.The final section of the show runs under the banner of ‘General Ignorance’ and aims to debunk those items of knowledge we all know but actually get wrong. And that is what this book is about.Today, society has probably never been more overcrowded with those who ‘know’ what they know, and who are desperate to shout their errors for the world to hear. One has only to listen to most leading politicians, led by their clown in command over the pond, to understand that information and facts are no longer the same things.This book sheds light onto those areas where we have all been misled, misinformed, or downright fooled. An example from the many given: Dan Brown’s ‘The Da Vinci Code’ encouraged the popular misconception about 5 million witches being burned at the stake during Europe’s witch hunts in the period of religious fanaticism from 1450 to 1750. In reality, the figure is closer to 40,000, and the vast majority were hanged rather than burnt. In England, only 200 such executions were recorded and a handful of these were burned. Most trials ended in acquittal, and the general public resisted the idea of witch-hunting, which they regarded as superstitious and prejudicial to public order.And one other: How many commandments in the Bible? Why, ten, of course! Wrong! There are at least 613, many of them ludicrous.Just two of hundreds of examples of misinformation spread by the prejudiced, the ignorant, the foolish and those who would control us, if we allow them. Topics cover a wide swathe of subjects including animals, geography, science, mechanics, religion, celebrity, history and so many others.If, like me, you’re entertained by words and facts, you crave the truth but prefer not be lectured, and you appreciate witty humour, this book is for you. I finished it off in the restricted public of a small hospital ward and my occasional bursts of laughter intrigued my fellow patients enough for them to want to read it."

The very British authors smartly destroy many commonly-accepted truths and build upon these revelations with sometimes wow-worthy related information and surprises.Their arguments generally seem quite solid, especially given they write in that convincing British way, yet they can be criticized for not providing a bibliography or a proper source list or referencing. I guess we just have to take the word of a British comedian and TV show writer. Moreover, a number of the shocking revelations are actually only slightly different from what most people thought, with many of those relying on semantic differences or petty trivialities. That said, overall I had a great time reading a few choice items before bed over a period of months, and mildly impressing some friends with my newfound temporarily-memorized knowledge!True Rating: 4.0 StarsChoice Factoids and Bits (Spoilers)- Page 18: Marco Polo was born in modern Croatia and his name means Mark Chicken in English (didn't clue in to this)- Page 20: Heron of Greece (around 62 AD) invented the first known steam engine, while Periander, tyrant of Corinth, had invented the railway which was called a Diolkos (slipway), and consisted of trolleys on rails used to transfer ships between the Ionian and Aegean seas. This railway was in use until the 900s AD.- Page 21: Antonio Meucci, a Florentine inventor, invented the telephone but died poor in part because of Alexander Graham Bell- Page 23: Kilts, bagpipes, haggis, porridge, whisky and tartans do not originally come from Scotland- Page 59: Three-toed sloths are docile and have nine bones in their neck, two-toed sloths are vicious and have six.- Page 62: A blue whale's penis is 6 to 10 feet in length and around 18 inches in girth. A blue whale's ejaculate contains around 35 pints which come from its 150 pound-per-ball testes. Eskimos traditionally use whale penis-bones as runners for their sleds.- Pages 64-65: You don't mess with hippos. They kill more people than any other African animal not counting the mosquito. They drown lions, bite crocodiles in half and drag sharks out of the water and trample them to death. Their skin is a ton of 1.5 inch thick bulletproof armour. Hippos can easily outrun people. Hippos have massive teeth, powerful jaws, and can stay totally submerged underwater for five minutes at a time. They are also very defensive and violent when threatened.- Page 69: In 1942 BF Skinner came up with pigeon-guided missiles. The pigeons were trained to peck at the image of a ship. When launched they would peck more the closer they got to a ship and get more grain (reward) as well until they were showered with grain before blowing up.- Page 94: America is named after Richard Ameryk, a Bristol merchant and the chief investor in the second voyage of John Cabot.- Page 118: The Thule people of Greenland thought they were the only people on earth until the 19th century and built large ice palaces and massive igloos.- Page 122: The Andaman people are fascinating. They never learned how to make fire and have kept the same fires burning for thousands of years by transporting embers.- Page 130: Amazonian Natives made boots out of liquid latex.- Page 133: Conan the Bacterium: a bacterium that can stand 1.5 million rads of radiation, doubling when frozen.- Page 138: The whip was the first invention to break the sound barrier. It was invented 7000 years ago in China.- Pages 141-142: Cats tend to survive falls higher than 7 stories, and in WWII an RAF tailgunner jumped out of his burning plane, fell 19 000 feet, hit a pine tree, then a snow bank and was unharmed.- Page 156: Most of the world's oxygen is produced by algae. Spirulina, a form of cyanobacteria, is an incredible source of protein and healthy food, even fighting cancer, and it can be grown very sustainably in brackish water all while contributing tons of oxygen to the atmosphere.- Page 172: Tons of amazing honey bee facts. Bees are highly-sensitive to the earth's magnetic field and a strong magnet placed next to a hive under construction causes them to make strange, cylindrical honeycombs. Bees evolved 150 million years ago, around the same time as flowering plants. IT TAKES THE ENTIRE LIFETIMES OF TWELVE BEES TO MAKE ENOUGH HONEY TO FILL A TEASPOON.- Page 175: Ants can survive for 19 days underwater and wood ants can live 24 days without their head. Ants are not abnormally strong. If humans were the same size as ants, they would be equally strong.- Page 178: Alcohol does not kill brain cells.- Page 206: In the original version of Roald Dahl's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory the Oompa-Loompas were described as a a tribe of three thousand black pygmies imported from ""the very deepest and darkest part of the African jungle where no white man had been before.""- Page 214: Coffee beans are actually the seeds of coffee fruit, which comes from the coffee tree, which is an evergreen tree that grows to twenty feet in the wild. It takes 2000 Arabica coffee seeds to make 1lb of coffee.- Page 217: Pistachios are classified internationally as flammable solids as they have a tendency to spontaneously combust if stacked under pressure.- Page 226: 19th Century Cannibals did not cook their victims in large metal pots because the technology to create said pots was unavailable to them until the 20th century.- Page 242: Despite the fact that turkeys were native to North America (Mexico), the US Pilgrims ate turkeys they had brought with them from England. Turkeys were brought back to Spain by the Spanish in the 1500s, then sold by Muslim merchants around Europe, eventually arriving in Norfolk in England, where farmers selectively bred them to produce large-breasted turkeys, which the Pilgrims put on their ships.- Page 245: The great flood found in many religious myths actually happened: humans evolved as the last ice age ended, and witnessed drowning land and floods of biblical proportions, which was part of the reason they switched to agriculture..."

But those are good too.Somehow adding to its pleasures are the surprises the reader gets when confronted with beliefs that s/he has long held to be true...yet they aren't. Why anyone should be happy to be proven wrong repeatedly is a mystery but the fact remains: it's fun to get contradicted and then corrected from some unsuspected direction.There are so many of these interesting short pieces that most readers will still forget them, regardless. It's fun while it lasts, though. And yes, you will learn who it was who famously identified squirrels as 'the Devil's oven mitts"". If that helps."

What we hold as popular culture is often inaccurate, and other facts are so obscure that few people know them.

114,0307394913,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13703358-ms-smartarse,3,"I've had this book on my Kindle for ages, but without a particular plan for reading it (anytime soon). It was one of those books, that I categorized as ""has an interesting title and summary, buuuuuuuut I don't feel like reading it right now"". Then I had to spend some 8 hours in a Parisian train station, at night, after not having managed to sleep a wink the previous night... and Judassohn was proving to be much too difficult for my sleep-deprived brain; long story short, The Book of General Ignorance was the first ""friendly"" title I've stumbled on.There's not much to be said about the content, other than ""man I am so ignorant!"". It's basically a collection of facts that the vast majority of people get wrong, some with related ""FYI""s tacked on as a bonus.Given my above mentioned circumstances, it was interesting enough to keep me awake, make me feel bad about my ignorance aaaaaand make me feel somewhat better that I at least had heard of most things mentioned (even if my ""intel"" was woefully wrong). The suitably humorous manner of the author helped my ego keep at least a shred of its dignity... even if just barely."
115,0307394913,http://goodreads.com/user/show/382536-kerry,3,"This was a fun collection of the weird, curious and quite interesting facts collected and collated for the Stephen Fry hosted TV show, QI.I learned all sorts of things that I probably never needed to know and forgot by the time I was on to the next section. But I don't particularly care as I enjoyed reading it and it's perfect for a piecemeal read of just a few pages here and there when you aren't feeling like reading anything else.Just be aware that the last 25% of the ebook is actually the index. I guess because ebooks don't use small print and columns like paper books do, that it expanded considerably when the book was converted to the electronic version. It's still a useful index though (even if the page numbers in it relate to the paper edition) since each page number is hyperlinked. You still end up where you were wanting to go.I don't know if it's appropriate to say in a public forum, but this is an excellent ""bathroom book"". Read a bit on each visit when you feel like it and over time you'll work your way through it. If you have a paper copy, leave it in there and your visitors can do the same. And when you wonder why they disappeared down your hallway and never returned, this book will be the answer."

I'm American but spend a lot of time in England, as that's where my husband lives atm. I think it is rather obvious the book was inspired by QI as Stephen Fry writes the Foreword, and most of the questions have appeared on the the show. This probably explains one reason this book is entertaining, full of knowledge and has a little something for everyone. It is definitely a ""must read"" if one were to ask me!The book is made up of a wide array of subjects, from historical figures to the universe all the way to insects and phrases. The vast majority of questions are very interesting, things many think they know but actually don't because our school system lets us down. Personally, two of my favorite questions were: ""Who invented the Theory of Relativity?"" and ""Who was the first American president?"" Each ""question & answer"" is brief, giving concise information so the reader learns something new yet isn't swamped by the knowledge and instead can use this 'starter info' for further research on said topic, if one desires. I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys learning...especially in the area of misconceptions we were taught as well as random and intelligent facts. Great book! "

It is an easy book to read from for a little while and then stop if you have to. Each topic is its own mini chapter of sorts. I really enjoyed it and when finished I had to ask myself ""is the stuff in it really true? Or is it made up?"" Hmmmmmm....some of it sounds pretty far fetched and not easily verifiable. But other items are pretty interesting and really made me think. Like where did the saying ""let them eat cake!"" really come from. Not from where I always thought, according to this book. And which living thing will survive a nuclear disaster? Not a cockroach after all....who knew? All in all a really enjoyable read. Great if you like little bits of knowledge and tend to want to know all the whys? and how comes? and but what abouts? Great for adults and young adults.

Find out why in this fascinating, hard-to-put-down tome on 230 common misconceptions of the factual world…that is, if you dare to have your grade-school paradigms severely altered. Yes, you will be transported by such gems of knowledge as how to get the most caffeine out of your cup of coffee, how shrimp make themselves louder than a jet taking off, and whether it’s more dangerous to swim after eating or to put on pantyhose. I absolutely love the premise of this book, that everything “they” tell you has a motive, such as patriotic pride, money or fame. If you want the truth (and not everyone does), you must delve deeper, peruse the original documents, maps and to-date available data.

Maybe if I was a smarmy, self-righteous Brit who'd grown up in the school system of 30-40 years ago, this correcting-of-all-the-trivia-you-believe would be engaging. I'm not, and it's not.Every once in a while, there would be interesting titbits of information, but for the most part I found myself mentally answering the topic questions with 'I don't know,' 'I don't care,' or even 'WHO THE FUCK CARES?!'This book was produced by a television enterprise I'd never heard of, and has a foreword by Stephen Fry. Much as I enjoy Fry, his haughty mumble was what I'd hear in every word of this dull, dull book. You'd have to be even more boring than me to really enjoy all of this book, and if you are I sincerely hope you're not reading this.(On the plus side, I only paid a pound for this book hardcover, like new, so at least I don't feel ripped off.)"

One has only to listen to most leading politicians, led by their clown in command over the pond, to understand that information and facts are no longer the same things.This book sheds light onto those areas where we have all been misled, misinformed, or downright fooled. An example from the many given: Dan Brown’s ‘The Da Vinci Code’ encouraged the popular misconception about 5 million witches being burned at the stake during Europe’s witch hunts in the period of religious fanaticism from 1450 to 1750. In reality, the figure is closer to 40,000, and the vast majority were hanged rather than burnt. In England, only 200 such executions were recorded and a handful of these were burned. Most trials ended in acquittal, and the general public resisted the idea of witch-hunting, which they regarded as superstitious and prejudicial to public order.And one other: How many commandments in the Bible? Why, ten, of course! Wrong! There are at least 613, many of them ludicrous.Just two of hundreds of examples of misinformation spread by the prejudiced, the ignorant, the foolish and those who would control us, if we allow them. Topics cover a wide swathe of subjects including animals, geography, science, mechanics, religion, celebrity, history and so many others.If, like me, you’re entertained by words and facts, you crave the truth but prefer not be lectured, and you appreciate witty humour, this book is for you. I finished it off in the restricted public of a small hospital ward and my occasional bursts of laughter intrigued my fellow patients enough for them to want to read it."

The very British authors smartly destroy many commonly-accepted truths and build upon these revelations with sometimes wow-worthy related information and surprises.Their arguments generally seem quite solid, especially given they write in that convincing British way, yet they can be criticized for not providing a bibliography or a proper source list or referencing. I guess we just have to take the word of a British comedian and TV show writer. Moreover, a number of the shocking revelations are actually only slightly different from what most people thought, with many of those relying on semantic differences or petty trivialities.

This railway was in use until the 900s AD.- Page 21: Antonio Meucci, a Florentine inventor, invented the telephone but died poor in part because of Alexander Graham Bell- Page 23: Kilts, bagpipes, haggis, porridge, whisky and tartans do not originally come from Scotland- Page 59: Three-toed sloths are docile and have nine bones in their neck, two-toed sloths are vicious and have six.- Page 62: A blue whale's penis is 6 to 10 feet in length and around 18 inches in girth. A blue whale's ejaculate contains around 35 pints which come from its 150 pound-per-ball testes. Eskimos traditionally use whale penis-bones as runners for their sleds.- Pages 64-65: You don't mess with hippos. They kill more people than any other African animal not counting the mosquito. They drown lions, bite crocodiles in half and drag sharks out of the water and trample them to death. Their skin is a ton of 1.5 inch thick bulletproof armour. Hippos can easily outrun people. Hippos have massive teeth, powerful jaws, and can stay totally submerged underwater for five minutes at a time. They are also very defensive and violent when threatened.- Page 69: In 1942 BF Skinner came up with pigeon-guided missiles. The pigeons were trained to peck at the image of a ship. When launched they would peck more the closer they got to a ship and get more grain (reward) as well until they were showered with grain before blowing up.- Page 94: America is named after Richard Ameryk, a Bristol merchant and the chief investor in the second voyage of John Cabot.- Page 118: The Thule people of Greenland thought they were the only people on earth until the 19th century and built large ice palaces and massive igloos.- Page 122: The Andaman people are fascinating. They never learned how to make fire and have kept the same fires burning for thousands of years by transporting embers.- Page 130: Amazonian Natives made boots out of liquid latex.- Page 133: Conan the Bacterium: a bacterium that can stand 1.5 million rads of radiation, doubling when frozen.- Page 138: The whip was the first invention to break the sound barrier. It was invented 7000 years ago in China.- Pages 141-142: Cats tend to survive falls higher than 7 stories, and in WWII an RAF tailgunner jumped out of his burning plane, fell 19 000 feet, hit a pine tree, then a snow bank and was unharmed.- Page 156: Most of the world's oxygen is produced by algae. Spirulina, a form of cyanobacteria, is an incredible source of protein and healthy food, even fighting cancer, and it can be grown very sustainably in brackish water all while contributing tons of oxygen to the atmosphere.- Page 172: Tons of amazing honey bee facts. Bees are highly-sensitive to the earth's magnetic field and a strong magnet placed next to a hive under construction causes them to make strange, cylindrical honeycombs. Bees evolved 150 million years ago, around the same time as flowering plants. IT TAKES THE ENTIRE LIFETIMES OF TWELVE BEES TO MAKE ENOUGH HONEY TO FILL A TEASPOON.- Page 175: Ants can survive for 19 days underwater and wood ants can live 24 days without their head. Ants are not abnormally strong. If humans were the same size as ants, they would be equally strong.- Page 178: Alcohol does not kill brain cells.- Page 206: In the original version of Roald Dahl's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory the Oompa-Loompas were described as a a tribe of three thousand black pygmies imported from ""the very deepest and darkest part of the African jungle where no white man had been before.""- Page 214: Coffee beans are actually the seeds of coffee fruit, which comes from the coffee tree, which is an evergreen tree that grows to twenty feet in the wild. It takes 2000 Arabica coffee seeds to make 1lb of coffee.- Page 217: Pistachios are classified internationally as flammable solids as they have a tendency to spontaneously combust if stacked under pressure.- Page 226: 19th Century Cannibals did not cook their victims in large metal pots because the technology to create said pots was unavailable to them until the 20th century.- Page 242: Despite the fact that turkeys were native to North America (Mexico), the US Pilgrims ate turkeys they had brought with them from England. Turkeys were brought back to Spain by the Spanish in the 1500s, then sold by Muslim merchants around Europe, eventually arriving in Norfolk in England, where farmers selectively bred them to produce large-breasted turkeys, which the Pilgrims put on their ships.- Page 245: The great flood found in many religious myths actually happened: humans evolved as the last ice age ended, and witnessed drowning land and floods of biblical proportions, which was part of the reason they switched to agriculture..."

But those are good too.Somehow adding to its pleasures are the surprises the reader gets when confronted with beliefs that s/he has long held to be true...yet they aren't. Why anyone should be happy to be proven wrong repeatedly is a mystery but the fact remains: it's fun to get contradicted and then corrected from some unsuspected direction.There are so many of these interesting short pieces that most readers will still forget them, regardless. It's fun while it lasts, though. And yes, you will learn who it was who famously identified squirrels as 'the Devil's oven mitts"". If that helps."

What we hold as popular culture is often inaccurate, and other facts are so obscure that few people know them. Here is a readable book organized into page to page and a half entries that make reading in small bits of time feasible. A book to be read in small bites instead of in one or two long sittings. I will never remember all of it, but it was fun reading."

144,0307394913,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13703358-ms-smartarse,3,"I've had this book on my Kindle for ages, but without a particular plan for reading it (anytime soon). It was one of those books, that I categorized as ""has an interesting title and summary, buuuuuuuut I don't feel like reading it right now"". Then I had to spend some 8 hours in a Parisian train station, at night, after not having managed to sleep a wink the previous night... and Judassohn was proving to be much too difficult for my sleep-deprived brain; long story short, The Book of General Ignorance was the first ""friendly"" title I've stumbled on.There's not much to be said about the content, other than ""man I am so ignorant!"". It's basically a collection of facts that the vast majority of people get wrong, some with related ""FYI""s tacked on as a bonus.Given my above mentioned circumstances, it was interesting enough to keep me awake, make me feel bad about my ignorance aaaaaand make me feel somewhat better that I at least had heard of most things mentioned (even if my ""intel"" was woefully wrong). The suitably humorous manner of the author helped my ego keep at least a shred of its dignity... even if just barely."

But I don't particularly care as I enjoyed reading it and it's perfect for a piecemeal read of just a few pages here and there when you aren't feeling like reading anything else.Just be aware that the last 25% of the ebook is actually the index. I guess because ebooks don't use small print and columns like paper books do, that it expanded considerably when the book was converted to the electronic version. It's still a useful index though (even if the page numbers in it relate to the paper edition) since each page number is hyperlinked. You still end up where you were wanting to go.I don't know if it's appropriate to say in a public forum, but this is an excellent ""bathroom book"". Read a bit on each visit when you feel like it and over time you'll work your way through it. If you have a paper copy, leave it in there and your visitors can do the same. And when you wonder why they disappeared down your hallway and never returned, this book will be the answer."

I'm American but spend a lot of time in England, as that's where my husband lives atm. I think it is rather obvious the book was inspired by QI as Stephen Fry writes the Foreword, and most of the questions have appeared on the the show. This probably explains one reason this book is entertaining, full of knowledge and has a little something for everyone. It is definitely a ""must read"" if one were to ask me!The book is made up of a wide array of subjects, from historical figures to the universe all the way to insects and phrases. The vast majority of questions are very interesting, things many think they know but actually don't because our school system lets us down. Personally, two of my favorite questions were: ""Who invented the Theory of Relativity?"" and ""Who was the first American president?"" Each ""question & answer"" is brief, giving concise information so the reader learns something new yet isn't swamped by the knowledge and instead can use this 'starter info' for further research on said topic, if one desires. I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys learning...especially in the area of misconceptions we were taught as well as random and intelligent facts. Great book! "

It is an easy book to read from for a little while and then stop if you have to. Each topic is its own mini chapter of sorts. I really enjoyed it and when finished I had to ask myself ""is the stuff in it really true? Or is it made up?"" Hmmmmmm....some of it sounds pretty far fetched and not easily verifiable. But other items are pretty interesting and really made me think. Like where did the saying ""let them eat cake!"" really come from. Not from where I always thought, according to this book. And which living thing will survive a nuclear disaster? Not a cockroach after all....who knew? All in all a really enjoyable read. Great if you like little bits of knowledge and tend to want to know all the whys? and how comes? and but what abouts? Great for adults and young adults.

How many moons does the earth have? How long can a chicken live without its head? Whatever your answers are to these questions, you’ve got it all wrong. Find out why in this fascinating, hard-to-put-down tome on 230 common misconceptions of the factual world…that is, if you dare to have your grade-school paradigms severely altered. Yes, you will be transported by such gems of knowledge as how to get the most caffeine out of your cup of coffee, how shrimp make themselves louder than a jet taking off, and whether it’s more dangerous to swim after eating or to put on pantyhose. I absolutely love the premise of this book, that everything “they” tell you has a motive, such as patriotic pride, money or fame. If you want the truth (and not everyone does), you must delve deeper, peruse the original documents, maps and to-date available data.

This book, however, was too boring even for me. Maybe if I was a smarmy, self-righteous Brit who'd grown up in the school system of 30-40 years ago, this correcting-of-all-the-trivia-you-believe would be engaging. I'm not, and it's not.Every once in a while, there would be interesting titbits of information, but for the most part I found myself mentally answering the topic questions with 'I don't know,' 'I don't care,' or even 'WHO THE FUCK CARES?!'This book was produced by a television enterprise I'd never heard of, and has a foreword by Stephen Fry. Much as I enjoy Fry, his haughty mumble was what I'd hear in every word of this dull, dull book. You'd have to be even more boring than me to really enjoy all of this book, and if you are I sincerely hope you're not reading this.(On the plus side, I only paid a pound for this book hardcover, like new, so at least I don't feel ripped off.)"

Clearly, a book to be dipped into, rather than read at one sitting, it is nevertheless addictive.Those who know the TV show, first hosted by the inimitable Stephen Fry and latterly by the equally unique Sandie Toksvig, along with the intelligent but willing fall guy, Alan Davies, will be aware of the nature of the humour and eclectic content. For those who haven’t had this pleasure, this UK TV show presents facts in the form of alphabetised chunks of knowledge and sets questions intended to trap the panel of celebrity quiz contestants. Like no other quiz programme I know, it entertains, informs and educates whilst anarchic humour has the audience in stitches. The scoring system is understood by no one apart from the mischievous elves who research and set the questions.The final section of the show runs under the banner of ‘General Ignorance’ and aims to debunk those items of knowledge we all know but actually get wrong.

But those are good too.Somehow adding to its pleasures are the surprises the reader gets when confronted with beliefs that s/he has long held to be true...yet they aren't. Why anyone should be happy to be proven wrong repeatedly is a mystery but the fact remains: it's fun to get contradicted and then corrected from some unsuspected direction.There are so many of these interesting short pieces that most readers will still forget them, regardless. It's fun while it lasts, though. And yes, you will learn who it was who famously identified squirrels as 'the Devil's oven mitts"". If that helps."

What we hold as popular culture is often inaccurate, and other facts are so obscure that few people know them. Here is a readable book organized into page to page and a half entries that make reading in small bits of time feasible. A book to be read in small bites instead of in one or two long sittings. I will never remember all of it, but it was fun reading."

It was one of those books, that I categorized as ""has an interesting title and summary, buuuuuuuut I don't feel like reading it right now"". Then I had to spend some 8 hours in a Parisian train station, at night, after not having managed to sleep a wink the previous night... and Judassohn was proving to be much too difficult for my sleep-deprived brain; long story short, The Book of General Ignorance was the first ""friendly"" title I've stumbled on.There's not much to be said about the content, other than ""man I am so ignorant!"". It's basically a collection of facts that the vast majority of people get wrong, some with related ""FYI""s tacked on as a bonus.Given my above mentioned circumstances, it was interesting enough to keep me awake, make me feel bad about my ignorance aaaaaand make me feel somewhat better that I at least had heard of most things mentioned (even if my ""intel"" was woefully wrong). The suitably humorous manner of the author helped my ego keep at least a shred of its dignity... even if just barely."

But I don't particularly care as I enjoyed reading it and it's perfect for a piecemeal read of just a few pages here and there when you aren't feeling like reading anything else.Just be aware that the last 25% of the ebook is actually the index. I guess because ebooks don't use small print and columns like paper books do, that it expanded considerably when the book was converted to the electronic version. It's still a useful index though (even if the page numbers in it relate to the paper edition) since each page number is hyperlinked. You still end up where you were wanting to go.I don't know if it's appropriate to say in a public forum, but this is an excellent ""bathroom book"". Read a bit on each visit when you feel like it and over time you'll work your way through it. If you have a paper copy, leave it in there and your visitors can do the same. And when you wonder why they disappeared down your hallway and never returned, this book will be the answer."

I'm American but spend a lot of time in England, as that's where my husband lives atm. I think it is rather obvious the book was inspired by QI as Stephen Fry writes the Foreword, and most of the questions have appeared on the the show. This probably explains one reason this book is entertaining, full of knowledge and has a little something for everyone. It is definitely a ""must read"" if one were to ask me!The book is made up of a wide array of subjects, from historical figures to the universe all the way to insects and phrases. The vast majority of questions are very interesting, things many think they know but actually don't because our school system lets us down. Personally, two of my favorite questions were: ""Who invented the Theory of Relativity?"" and ""Who was the first American president?"" Each ""question & answer"" is brief, giving concise information so the reader learns something new yet isn't swamped by the knowledge and instead can use this 'starter info' for further research on said topic, if one desires. I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys learning...especially in the area of misconceptions we were taught as well as random and intelligent facts. Great book! "

It is an easy book to read from for a little while and then stop if you have to. Each topic is its own mini chapter of sorts. I really enjoyed it and when finished I had to ask myself ""is the stuff in it really true? Or is it made up?"" Hmmmmmm....some of it sounds pretty far fetched and not easily verifiable. But other items are pretty interesting and really made me think. Like where did the saying ""let them eat cake!"" really come from. Not from where I always thought, according to this book. And which living thing will survive a nuclear disaster? Not a cockroach after all....who knew? All in all a really enjoyable read. Great if you like little bits of knowledge and tend to want to know all the whys? and how comes? and but what abouts? Great for adults and young adults.

How many moons does the earth have? How long can a chicken live without its head? Whatever your answers are to these questions, you’ve got it all wrong. Find out why in this fascinating, hard-to-put-down tome on 230 common misconceptions of the factual world…that is, if you dare to have your grade-school paradigms severely altered. Yes, you will be transported by such gems of knowledge as how to get the most caffeine out of your cup of coffee, how shrimp make themselves louder than a jet taking off, and whether it’s more dangerous to swim after eating or to put on pantyhose. I absolutely love the premise of this book, that everything “they” tell you has a motive, such as patriotic pride, money or fame. If you want the truth (and not everyone does), you must delve deeper, peruse the original documents, maps and to-date available data. Even this book, though written by grand intellects, already has some mistakes both in editing and in theoretical thinking…see if you can find them for yourself!"

I like boring pastimes, I listen to boring music, like boring movies, and have read some boring books (off the top of my head, Pilgrim's Progress and Moby Dick top my boring list). This book, however, was too boring even for me. Maybe if I was a smarmy, self-righteous Brit who'd grown up in the school system of 30-40 years ago, this correcting-of-all-the-trivia-you-believe would be engaging. I'm not, and it's not.Every once in a while, there would be interesting titbits of information, but for the most part I found myself mentally answering the topic questions with 'I don't know,' 'I don't care,' or even 'WHO THE FUCK CARES?!'This book was produced by a television enterprise I'd never heard of, and has a foreword by Stephen Fry. Much as I enjoy Fry, his haughty mumble was what I'd hear in every word of this dull, dull book. You'd have to be even more boring than me to really enjoy all of this book, and if you are I sincerely hope you're not reading this.(On the plus side, I only paid a pound for this book hardcover, like new, so at least I don't feel ripped off.)"

194,0307394913,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4176122-stuart-aken,5,"Subtitled ‘The Noticeably Stouter Edition’, this book of humorously presented erudition is a gem. Clearly, a book to be dipped into, rather than read at one sitting, it is nevertheless addictive.Those who know the TV show, first hosted by the inimitable Stephen Fry and latterly by the equally unique Sandie Toksvig, along with the intelligent but willing fall guy, Alan Davies, will be aware of the nature of the humour and eclectic content. For those who haven’t had this pleasure, this UK TV show presents facts in the form of alphabetised chunks of knowledge and sets questions intended to trap the panel of celebrity quiz contestants. Like no other quiz programme I know, it entertains, informs and educates whilst anarchic humour has the audience in stitches. The scoring system is understood by no one apart from the mischievous elves who research and set the questions.The final section of the show runs under the banner of ‘General Ignorance’ and aims to debunk those items of knowledge we all know but actually get wrong. And that is what this book is about.Today, society has probably never been more overcrowded with those who ‘know’ what they know, and who are desperate to shout their errors for the world to hear. One has only to listen to most leading politicians, led by their clown in command over the pond, to understand that information and facts are no longer the same things.This book sheds light onto those areas where we have all been misled, misinformed, or downright fooled. An example from the many given: Dan Brown’s ‘The Da Vinci Code’ encouraged the popular misconception about 5 million witches being burned at the stake during Europe’s witch hunts in the period of religious fanaticism from 1450 to 1750. In reality, the figure is closer to 40,000, and the vast majority were hanged rather than burnt. In England, only 200 such executions were recorded and a handful of these were burned. Most trials ended in acquittal, and the general public resisted the idea of witch-hunting, which they regarded as superstitious and prejudicial to public order.And one other: How many commandments in the Bible? Why, ten, of course! Wrong! There are at least 613, many of them ludicrous.Just two of hundreds of examples of misinformation spread by the prejudiced, the ignorant, the foolish and those who would control us, if we allow them. Topics cover a wide swathe of subjects including animals, geography, science, mechanics, religion, celebrity, history and so many others.If, like me, you’re entertained by words and facts, you crave the truth but prefer not be lectured, and you appreciate witty humour, this book is for you. I finished it off in the restricted public of a small hospital ward and my occasional bursts of laughter intrigued my fellow patients enough for them to want to read it."

I guess because ebooks don't use small print and columns like paper books do, that it expanded considerably when the book was converted to the electronic version. It's still a useful index though (even if the page numbers in it relate to the paper edition) since each page number is hyperlinked. You still end up where you were wanting to go.I don't know if it's appropriate to say in a public forum, but this is an excellent ""bathroom book"".

I'm American but spend a lot of time in England, as that's where my husband lives atm. I think it is rather obvious the book was inspired by QI as Stephen Fry writes the Foreword, and most of the questions have appeared on the the show. This probably explains one reason this book is entertaining, full of knowledge and has a little something for everyone. It is definitely a ""must read"" if one were to ask me!The book is made up of a wide array of subjects, from historical figures to the universe all the way to insects and phrases. The vast majority of questions are very interesting, things many think they know but actually don't because our school system lets us down. Personally, two of my favorite questions were: ""Who invented the Theory of Relativity?"" and ""Who was the first American president?"" Each ""question & answer"" is brief, giving concise information so the reader learns something new yet isn't swamped by the knowledge and instead can use this 'starter info' for further research on said topic, if one desires. I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys learning...especially in the area of misconceptions we were taught as well as random and intelligent facts. Great book! "

It is an easy book to read from for a little while and then stop if you have to. Each topic is its own mini chapter of sorts. I really enjoyed it and when finished I had to ask myself ""is the stuff in it really true? Or is it made up?"" Hmmmmmm....some of it sounds pretty far fetched and not easily verifiable. But other items are pretty interesting and really made me think. Like where did the saying ""let them eat cake!"" really come from. Not from where I always thought, according to this book. And which living thing will survive a nuclear disaster? Not a cockroach after all....who knew? All in all a really enjoyable read. Great if you like little bits of knowledge and tend to want to know all the whys? and how comes? and but what abouts? Great for adults and young adults.

How many moons does the earth have? How long can a chicken live without its head? Whatever your answers are to these questions, you’ve got it all wrong. Find out why in this fascinating, hard-to-put-down tome on 230 common misconceptions of the factual world…that is, if you dare to have your grade-school paradigms severely altered. Yes, you will be transported by such gems of knowledge as how to get the most caffeine out of your cup of coffee, how shrimp make themselves louder than a jet taking off, and whether it’s more dangerous to swim after eating or to put on pantyhose. I absolutely love the premise of this book, that everything “they” tell you has a motive, such as patriotic pride, money or fame. If you want the truth (and not everyone does), you must delve deeper, peruse the original documents, maps and to-date available data.

I'm not, and it's not.Every once in a while, there would be interesting titbits of information, but for the most part I found myself mentally answering the topic questions with 'I don't know,' 'I don't care,' or even 'WHO THE FUCK CARES?!'This book was produced by a television enterprise I'd never heard of, and has a foreword by Stephen Fry. Much as I enjoy Fry, his haughty mumble was what I'd hear in every word of this dull, dull book. You'd have to be even more boring than me to really enjoy all of this book, and if you are I sincerely hope you're not reading this.(On the plus side, I only paid a pound for this book hardcover, like new, so at least I don't feel ripped off.)"

Clearly, a book to be dipped into, rather than read at one sitting, it is nevertheless addictive.Those who know the TV show, first hosted by the inimitable Stephen Fry and latterly by the equally unique Sandie Toksvig, along with the intelligent but willing fall guy, Alan Davies, will be aware of the nature of the humour and eclectic content. For those who haven’t had this pleasure, this UK TV show presents facts in the form of alphabetised chunks of knowledge and sets questions intended to trap the panel of celebrity quiz contestants. Like no other quiz programme I know, it entertains, informs and educates whilst anarchic humour has the audience in stitches. The scoring system is understood by no one apart from the mischievous elves who research and set the questions.The final section of the show runs under the banner of ‘General Ignorance’ and aims to debunk those items of knowledge we all know but actually get wrong. And that is what this book is about.Today, society has probably never been more overcrowded with those who ‘know’ what they know, and who are desperate to shout their errors for the world to hear. One has only to listen to most leading politicians, led by their clown in command over the pond, to understand that information and facts are no longer the same things.This book sheds light onto those areas where we have all been misled, misinformed, or downright fooled. An example from the many given: Dan Brown’s ‘The Da Vinci Code’ encouraged the popular misconception about 5 million witches being burned at the stake during Europe’s witch hunts in the period of religious fanaticism from 1450 to 1750. In reality, the figure is closer to 40,000, and the vast majority were hanged rather than burnt. In England, only 200 such executions were recorded and a handful of these were burned. Most trials ended in acquittal, and the general public resisted the idea of witch-hunting, which they regarded as superstitious and prejudicial to public order.And one other: How many commandments in the Bible? Why, ten, of course! Wrong! There are at least 613, many of them ludicrous.Just two of hundreds of examples of misinformation spread by the prejudiced, the ignorant, the foolish and those who would control us, if we allow them. Topics cover a wide swathe of subjects including animals, geography, science, mechanics, religion, celebrity, history and so many others.If, like me, you’re entertained by words and facts, you crave the truth but prefer not be lectured, and you appreciate witty humour, this book is for you. I finished it off in the restricted public of a small hospital ward and my occasional bursts of laughter intrigued my fellow patients enough for them to want to read it."

The very British authors smartly destroy many commonly-accepted truths and build upon these revelations with sometimes wow-worthy related information and surprises.Their arguments generally seem quite solid, especially given they write in that convincing British way, yet they can be criticized for not providing a bibliography or a proper source list or referencing. I guess we just have to take the word of a British comedian and TV show writer. Moreover, a number of the shocking revelations are actually only slightly different from what most people thought, with many of those relying on semantic differences or petty trivialities.

Eskimos traditionally use whale penis-bones as runners for their sleds.- Pages 64-65: You don't mess with hippos. They kill more people than any other African animal not counting the mosquito. They drown lions, bite crocodiles in half and drag sharks out of the water and trample them to death. Their skin is a ton of 1.5 inch thick bulletproof armour. Hippos can easily outrun people. Hippos have massive teeth, powerful jaws, and can stay totally submerged underwater for five minutes at a time. They are also very defensive and violent when threatened.- Page 69: In 1942 BF Skinner came up with pigeon-guided missiles. The pigeons were trained to peck at the image of a ship.

It was invented 7000 years ago in China.- Pages 141-142: Cats tend to survive falls higher than 7 stories, and in WWII an RAF tailgunner jumped out of his burning plane, fell 19 000 feet, hit a pine tree, then a snow bank and was unharmed.- Page 156: Most of the world's oxygen is produced by algae. Spirulina, a form of cyanobacteria, is an incredible source of protein and healthy food, even fighting cancer, and it can be grown very sustainably in brackish water all while contributing tons of oxygen to the atmosphere.- Page 172: Tons of amazing honey bee facts.

I'm American but spend a lot of time in England, as that's where my husband lives atm.

This probably explains one reason this book is entertaining, full of knowledge and has a little something for everyone. It is definitely a ""must read"" if one were to ask me!The book is made up of a wide array of subjects, from historical figures to the universe all the way to insects and phrases. The vast majority of questions are very interesting, things many think they know but actually don't because our school system lets us down. Personally, two of my favorite questions were: ""Who invented the Theory of Relativity?"" and ""Who was the first American president?"" Each ""question & answer"" is brief, giving concise information so the reader learns something new yet isn't swamped by the knowledge and instead can use this 'starter info' for further research on said topic, if one desires.

Much as I enjoy Fry, his haughty mumble was what I'd hear in every word of this dull, dull book.

254,0307394913,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4176122-stuart-aken,5,"Subtitled ‘The Noticeably Stouter Edition’, this book of humorously presented erudition is a gem. Clearly, a book to be dipped into, rather than read at one sitting, it is nevertheless addictive.Those who know the TV show, first hosted by the inimitable Stephen Fry and latterly by the equally unique Sandie Toksvig, along with the intelligent but willing fall guy, Alan Davies, will be aware of the nature of the humour and eclectic content. For those who haven’t had this pleasure, this UK TV show presents facts in the form of alphabetised chunks of knowledge and sets questions intended to trap the panel of celebrity quiz contestants. Like no other quiz programme I know, it entertains, informs and educates whilst anarchic humour has the audience in stitches. The scoring system is understood by no one apart from the mischievous elves who research and set the questions.The final section of the show runs under the banner of ‘General Ignorance’ and aims to debunk those items of knowledge we all know but actually get wrong. And that is what this book is about.Today, society has probably never been more overcrowded with those who ‘know’ what they know, and who are desperate to shout their errors for the world to hear. One has only to listen to most leading politicians, led by their clown in command over the pond, to understand that information and facts are no longer the same things.This book sheds light onto those areas where we have all been misled, misinformed, or downright fooled. An example from the many given: Dan Brown’s ‘The Da Vinci Code’ encouraged the popular misconception about 5 million witches being burned at the stake during Europe’s witch hunts in the period of religious fanaticism from 1450 to 1750. In reality, the figure is closer to 40,000, and the vast majority were hanged rather than burnt. In England, only 200 such executions were recorded and a handful of these were burned. Most trials ended in acquittal, and the general public resisted the idea of witch-hunting, which they regarded as superstitious and prejudicial to public order.And one other: How many commandments in the Bible? Why, ten, of course! Wrong! There are at least 613, many of them ludicrous.Just two of hundreds of examples of misinformation spread by the prejudiced, the ignorant, the foolish and those who would control us, if we allow them. Topics cover a wide swathe of subjects including animals, geography, science, mechanics, religion, celebrity, history and so many others.If, like me, you’re entertained by words and facts, you crave the truth but prefer not be lectured, and you appreciate witty humour, this book is for you. I finished it off in the restricted public of a small hospital ward and my occasional bursts of laughter intrigued my fellow patients enough for them to want to read it."

The very British authors smartly destroy many commonly-accepted truths and build upon these revelations with sometimes wow-worthy related information and surprises.Their arguments generally seem quite solid, especially given they write in that convincing British way, yet they can be criticized for not providing a bibliography or a proper source list or referencing. I guess we just have to take the word of a British comedian and TV show writer. Moreover, a number of the shocking revelations are actually only slightly different from what most people thought, with many of those relying on semantic differences or petty trivialities. That said, overall I had a great time reading a few choice items before bed over a period of months, and mildly impressing some friends with my newfound temporarily-memorized knowledge!True Rating: 4.0 StarsChoice Factoids and Bits (Spoilers)- Page 18: Marco Polo was born in modern Croatia and his name means Mark Chicken in English (didn't clue in to this)- Page 20: Heron of Greece (around 62 AD) invented the first known steam engine, while Periander, tyrant of Corinth, had invented the railway which was called a Diolkos (slipway), and consisted of trolleys on rails used to transfer ships between the Ionian and Aegean seas. This railway was in use until the 900s AD.- Page 21: Antonio Meucci, a Florentine inventor, invented the telephone but died poor in part because of Alexander Graham Bell- Page 23: Kilts, bagpipes, haggis, porridge, whisky and tartans do not originally come from Scotland- Page 59: Three-toed sloths are docile and have nine bones in their neck, two-toed sloths are vicious and have six.- Page 62: A blue whale's penis is 6 to 10 feet in length and around 18 inches in girth. A blue whale's ejaculate contains around 35 pints which come from its 150 pound-per-ball testes. Eskimos traditionally use whale penis-bones as runners for their sleds.- Pages 64-65: You don't mess with hippos. They kill more people than any other African animal not counting the mosquito. They drown lions, bite crocodiles in half and drag sharks out of the water and trample them to death. Their skin is a ton of 1.5 inch thick bulletproof armour. Hippos can easily outrun people. Hippos have massive teeth, powerful jaws, and can stay totally submerged underwater for five minutes at a time. They are also very defensive and violent when threatened.- Page 69: In 1942 BF Skinner came up with pigeon-guided missiles. The pigeons were trained to peck at the image of a ship. When launched they would peck more the closer they got to a ship and get more grain (reward) as well until they were showered with grain before blowing up.- Page 94: America is named after Richard Ameryk, a Bristol merchant and the chief investor in the second voyage of John Cabot.- Page 118: The Thule people of Greenland thought they were the only people on earth until the 19th century and built large ice palaces and massive igloos.- Page 122: The Andaman people are fascinating. They never learned how to make fire and have kept the same fires burning for thousands of years by transporting embers.- Page 130: Amazonian Natives made boots out of liquid latex.- Page 133: Conan the Bacterium: a bacterium that can stand 1.5 million rads of radiation, doubling when frozen.- Page 138: The whip was the first invention to break the sound barrier. It was invented 7000 years ago in China.- Pages 141-142: Cats tend to survive falls higher than 7 stories, and in WWII an RAF tailgunner jumped out of his burning plane, fell 19 000 feet, hit a pine tree, then a snow bank and was unharmed.- Page 156: Most of the world's oxygen is produced by algae. Spirulina, a form of cyanobacteria, is an incredible source of protein and healthy food, even fighting cancer, and it can be grown very sustainably in brackish water all while contributing tons of oxygen to the atmosphere.- Page 172: Tons of amazing honey bee facts. Bees are highly-sensitive to the earth's magnetic field and a strong magnet placed next to a hive under construction causes them to make strange, cylindrical honeycombs. Bees evolved 150 million years ago, around the same time as flowering plants. IT TAKES THE ENTIRE LIFETIMES OF TWELVE BEES TO MAKE ENOUGH HONEY TO FILL A TEASPOON.- Page 175: Ants can survive for 19 days underwater and wood ants can live 24 days without their head. Ants are not abnormally strong. If humans were the same size as ants, they would be equally strong.- Page 178: Alcohol does not kill brain cells.- Page 206: In the original version of Roald Dahl's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory the Oompa-Loompas were described as a a tribe of three thousand black pygmies imported from ""the very deepest and darkest part of the African jungle where no white man had been before.""- Page 214: Coffee beans are actually the seeds of coffee fruit, which comes from the coffee tree, which is an evergreen tree that grows to twenty feet in the wild. It takes 2000 Arabica coffee seeds to make 1lb of coffee.- Page 217: Pistachios are classified internationally as flammable solids as they have a tendency to spontaneously combust if stacked under pressure.- Page 226: 19th Century Cannibals did not cook their victims in large metal pots because the technology to create said pots was unavailable to them until the 20th century.- Page 242: Despite the fact that turkeys were native to North America (Mexico), the US Pilgrims ate turkeys they had brought with them from England. Turkeys were brought back to Spain by the Spanish in the 1500s, then sold by Muslim merchants around Europe, eventually arriving in Norfolk in England, where farmers selectively bred them to produce large-breasted turkeys, which the Pilgrims put on their ships.- Page 245: The great flood found in many religious myths actually happened: humans evolved as the last ice age ended, and witnessed drowning land and floods of biblical proportions, which was part of the reason they switched to agriculture..."

But those are good too.Somehow adding to its pleasures are the surprises the reader gets when confronted with beliefs that s/he has long held to be true...yet they aren't. Why anyone should be happy to be proven wrong repeatedly is a mystery but the fact remains: it's fun to get contradicted and then corrected from some unsuspected direction.There are so many of these interesting short pieces that most readers will still forget them, regardless.

Maybe if I was a smarmy, self-righteous Brit who'd grown up in the school system of 30-40 years ago, this correcting-of-all-the-trivia-you-believe would be engaging. I'm not, and it's not.Every once in a while, there would be interesting titbits of information, but for the most part I found myself mentally answering the topic questions with 'I don't know,' 'I don't care,' or even 'WHO THE FUCK CARES?!'This book was produced by a television enterprise I'd never heard of, and has a foreword by Stephen Fry. Much as I enjoy Fry, his haughty mumble was what I'd hear in every word of this dull, dull book. You'd have to be even more boring than me to really enjoy all of this book, and if you are I sincerely hope you're not reading this.(On the plus side, I only paid a pound for this book hardcover, like new, so at least I don't feel ripped off.)"

272,0307394913,http://goodreads.com/user/show/934040-jim,3,"This book was fairly amusing. It consists of 230 questions and answers about subjects that most people would not know much about. It is somewhat like detailed answers to questions that might be asked in a pub's Quiz Night. Each of the answers was surprising in some way.

GI combines urban legends, facts, factoids and wonderfully detailed explanations about everything.A bit dense to read cover-to-cover, but great - dare I say it? - as an intelligent choice for the smallest room in the house.With an index, it would be perfect. But that's a nitpick. The book of GI is fun and informative."

284,0307394913,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4176122-stuart-aken,5,"Subtitled ‘The Noticeably Stouter Edition’, this book of humorously presented erudition is a gem. Clearly, a book to be dipped into, rather than read at one sitting, it is nevertheless addictive.Those who know the TV show, first hosted by the inimitable Stephen Fry and latterly by the equally unique Sandie Toksvig, along with the intelligent but willing fall guy, Alan Davies, will be aware of the nature of the humour and eclectic content. For those who haven’t had this pleasure, this UK TV show presents facts in the form of alphabetised chunks of knowledge and sets questions intended to trap the panel of celebrity quiz contestants. Like no other quiz programme I know, it entertains, informs and educates whilst anarchic humour has the audience in stitches. The scoring system is understood by no one apart from the mischievous elves who research and set the questions.The final section of the show runs under the banner of ‘General Ignorance’ and aims to debunk those items of knowledge we all know but actually get wrong. And that is what this book is about.Today, society has probably never been more overcrowded with those who ‘know’ what they know, and who are desperate to shout their errors for the world to hear. One has only to listen to most leading politicians, led by their clown in command over the pond, to understand that information and facts are no longer the same things.This book sheds light onto those areas where we have all been misled, misinformed, or downright fooled. An example from the many given: Dan Brown’s ‘The Da Vinci Code’ encouraged the popular misconception about 5 million witches being burned at the stake during Europe’s witch hunts in the period of religious fanaticism from 1450 to 1750. In reality, the figure is closer to 40,000, and the vast majority were hanged rather than burnt. In England, only 200 such executions were recorded and a handful of these were burned. Most trials ended in acquittal, and the general public resisted the idea of witch-hunting, which they regarded as superstitious and prejudicial to public order.And one other: How many commandments in the Bible? Why, ten, of course! Wrong! There are at least 613, many of them ludicrous.Just two of hundreds of examples of misinformation spread by the prejudiced, the ignorant, the foolish and those who would control us, if we allow them. Topics cover a wide swathe of subjects including animals, geography, science, mechanics, religion, celebrity, history and so many others.If, like me, you’re entertained by words and facts, you crave the truth but prefer not be lectured, and you appreciate witty humour, this book is for you. I finished it off in the restricted public of a small hospital ward and my occasional bursts of laughter intrigued my fellow patients enough for them to want to read it."

286,0307394913,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4365813-nick,4,"The Book of General Ignorance is chock-full of fascinating revelations, facts, factoids, tidbits and witty retorts for trivia buffs and generalists or knowledge-freaks. The very British authors smartly destroy many commonly-accepted truths and build upon these revelations with sometimes wow-worthy related information and surprises.Their arguments generally seem quite solid, especially given they write in that convincing British way, yet they can be criticized for not providing a bibliography or a proper source list or referencing. I guess we just have to take the word of a British comedian and TV show writer. Moreover, a number of the shocking revelations are actually only slightly different from what most people thought, with many of those relying on semantic differences or petty trivialities. That said, overall I had a great time reading a few choice items before bed over a period of months, and mildly impressing some friends with my newfound temporarily-memorized knowledge!True Rating: 4.0 StarsChoice Factoids and Bits (Spoilers)- Page 18: Marco Polo was born in modern Croatia and his name means Mark Chicken in English (didn't clue in to this)- Page 20: Heron of Greece (around 62 AD) invented the first known steam engine, while Periander, tyrant of Corinth, had invented the railway which was called a Diolkos (slipway), and consisted of trolleys on rails used to transfer ships between the Ionian and Aegean seas. This railway was in use until the 900s AD.- Page 21: Antonio Meucci, a Florentine inventor, invented the telephone but died poor in part because of Alexander Graham Bell- Page 23: Kilts, bagpipes, haggis, porridge, whisky and tartans do not originally come from Scotland- Page 59: Three-toed sloths are docile and have nine bones in their neck, two-toed sloths are vicious and have six.- Page 62: A blue whale's penis is 6 to 10 feet in length and around 18 inches in girth. A blue whale's ejaculate contains around 35 pints which come from its 150 pound-per-ball testes. Eskimos traditionally use whale penis-bones as runners for their sleds.- Pages 64-65: You don't mess with hippos. They kill more people than any other African animal not counting the mosquito. They drown lions, bite crocodiles in half and drag sharks out of the water and trample them to death. Their skin is a ton of 1.5 inch thick bulletproof armour. Hippos can easily outrun people. Hippos have massive teeth, powerful jaws, and can stay totally submerged underwater for five minutes at a time. They are also very defensive and violent when threatened.- Page 69: In 1942 BF Skinner came up with pigeon-guided missiles. The pigeons were trained to peck at the image of a ship. When launched they would peck more the closer they got to a ship and get more grain (reward) as well until they were showered with grain before blowing up.- Page 94: America is named after Richard Ameryk, a Bristol merchant and the chief investor in the second voyage of John Cabot.- Page 118: The Thule people of Greenland thought they were the only people on earth until the 19th century and built large ice palaces and massive igloos.- Page 122: The Andaman people are fascinating. They never learned how to make fire and have kept the same fires burning for thousands of years by transporting embers.- Page 130: Amazonian Natives made boots out of liquid latex.- Page 133: Conan the Bacterium: a bacterium that can stand 1.5 million rads of radiation, doubling when frozen.- Page 138: The whip was the first invention to break the sound barrier. It was invented 7000 years ago in China.- Pages 141-142: Cats tend to survive falls higher than 7 stories, and in WWII an RAF tailgunner jumped out of his burning plane, fell 19 000 feet, hit a pine tree, then a snow bank and was unharmed.- Page 156: Most of the world's oxygen is produced by algae. Spirulina, a form of cyanobacteria, is an incredible source of protein and healthy food, even fighting cancer, and it can be grown very sustainably in brackish water all while contributing tons of oxygen to the atmosphere.- Page 172: Tons of amazing honey bee facts. Bees are highly-sensitive to the earth's magnetic field and a strong magnet placed next to a hive under construction causes them to make strange, cylindrical honeycombs. Bees evolved 150 million years ago, around the same time as flowering plants. IT TAKES THE ENTIRE LIFETIMES OF TWELVE BEES TO MAKE ENOUGH HONEY TO FILL A TEASPOON.- Page 175: Ants can survive for 19 days underwater and wood ants can live 24 days without their head. Ants are not abnormally strong. If humans were the same size as ants, they would be equally strong.- Page 178: Alcohol does not kill brain cells.- Page 206: In the original version of Roald Dahl's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory the Oompa-Loompas were described as a a tribe of three thousand black pygmies imported from ""the very deepest and darkest part of the African jungle where no white man had been before.""- Page 214: Coffee beans are actually the seeds of coffee fruit, which comes from the coffee tree, which is an evergreen tree that grows to twenty feet in the wild. It takes 2000 Arabica coffee seeds to make 1lb of coffee.- Page 217: Pistachios are classified internationally as flammable solids as they have a tendency to spontaneously combust if stacked under pressure.- Page 226: 19th Century Cannibals did not cook their victims in large metal pots because the technology to create said pots was unavailable to them until the 20th century.- Page 242: Despite the fact that turkeys were native to North America (Mexico), the US Pilgrims ate turkeys they had brought with them from England. Turkeys were brought back to Spain by the Spanish in the 1500s, then sold by Muslim merchants around Europe, eventually arriving in Norfolk in England, where farmers selectively bred them to produce large-breasted turkeys, which the Pilgrims put on their ships.- Page 245: The great flood found in many religious myths actually happened: humans evolved as the last ice age ended, and witnessed drowning land and floods of biblical proportions, which was part of the reason they switched to agriculture..."

But those are good too.Somehow adding to its pleasures are the surprises the reader gets when confronted with beliefs that s/he has long held to be true...yet they aren't. Why anyone should be happy to be proven wrong repeatedly is a mystery but the fact remains: it's fun to get contradicted and then corrected from some unsuspected direction.There are so many of these interesting short pieces that most readers will still forget them, regardless. It's fun while it lasts, though. And yes, you will learn who it was who famously identified squirrels as 'the Devil's oven mitts"". If that helps."

What we hold as popular culture is often inaccurate, and other facts are so obscure that few people know them.

It was one of those books, that I categorized as ""has an interesting title and summary, buuuuuuuut I don't feel like reading it right now"". Then I had to spend some 8 hours in a Parisian train station, at night, after not having managed to sleep a wink the previous night... and Judassohn was proving to be much too difficult for my sleep-deprived brain; long story short, The Book of General Ignorance was the first ""friendly"" title I've stumbled on.There's not much to be said about the content, other than ""man I am so ignorant!"". It's basically a collection of facts that the vast majority of people get wrong, some with related ""FYI""s tacked on as a bonus.Given my above mentioned circumstances, it was interesting enough to keep me awake, make me feel bad about my ignorance aaaaaand make me feel somewhat better that I at least had heard of most things mentioned (even if my ""intel"" was woefully wrong). The suitably humorous manner of the author helped my ego keep at least a shred of its dignity... even if just barely."

But I don't particularly care as I enjoyed reading it and it's perfect for a piecemeal read of just a few pages here and there when you aren't feeling like reading anything else.Just be aware that the last 25% of the ebook is actually the index. I guess because ebooks don't use small print and columns like paper books do, that it expanded considerably when the book was converted to the electronic version. It's still a useful index though (even if the page numbers in it relate to the paper edition) since each page number is hyperlinked. You still end up where you were wanting to go.I don't know if it's appropriate to say in a public forum, but this is an excellent ""bathroom book"". Read a bit on each visit when you feel like it and over time you'll work your way through it. If you have a paper copy, leave it in there and your visitors can do the same. And when you wonder why they disappeared down your hallway and never returned, this book will be the answer."

I'm American but spend a lot of time in England, as that's where my husband lives atm. I think it is rather obvious the book was inspired by QI as Stephen Fry writes the Foreword, and most of the questions have appeared on the the show. This probably explains one reason this book is entertaining, full of knowledge and has a little something for everyone. It is definitely a ""must read"" if one were to ask me!The book is made up of a wide array of subjects, from historical figures to the universe all the way to insects and phrases. The vast majority of questions are very interesting, things many think they know but actually don't because our school system lets us down. Personally, two of my favorite questions were: ""Who invented the Theory of Relativity?"" and ""Who was the first American president?"" Each ""question & answer"" is brief, giving concise information so the reader learns something new yet isn't swamped by the knowledge and instead can use this 'starter info' for further research on said topic, if one desires. I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys learning...especially in the area of misconceptions we were taught as well as random and intelligent facts. Great book! "

It is an easy book to read from for a little while and then stop if you have to. Each topic is its own mini chapter of sorts. I really enjoyed it and when finished I had to ask myself ""is the stuff in it really true? Or is it made up?"" Hmmmmmm....some of it sounds pretty far fetched and not easily verifiable. But other items are pretty interesting and really made me think. Like where did the saying ""let them eat cake!"" really come from. Not from where I always thought, according to this book. And which living thing will survive a nuclear disaster? Not a cockroach after all....who knew? All in all a really enjoyable read. Great if you like little bits of knowledge and tend to want to know all the whys? and how comes? and but what abouts? Great for adults and young adults.
