0,0374257833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6100646-brian-clegg,5,"As Melanie Mitchell makes plain, humans have limitations in their visual abilities, typified by optical illusions, but artificial intelligence (AI) struggles at a much deeper level with recognising what's going on in images. Similarly in some ways, the visual appearance of this book misleads. It's worryingly fat and bears the ascetic light blue cover of the Pelican series, which since my childhood have been markers of books that were worthy but have rarely been readable. This, however, is an excellent book, giving a clear picture of how many AI systems go about their business and the huge problems designers of such systems face.Not only does Mitchell explain the main approaches clearly, her account is readable and engaging. I read a lot of popular science books, and it's rare that I keep wanting to go back to one when I'm not scheduled to be reading it - this is one of those rare examples.We discover how AI researchers have achieved the apparently remarkable abilities of, for example, the Go champion AlphaGo, or the Jeopardy! playing Watson. In each case these systems are tightly designed for a particular purpose and arguably have no intelligence in the broad sense. As for what's probably the most impressively broad AI application of modern times, self-driving cars, Mitchell emphasises how limited they truly are. Like so many AI applications, the hype far exceeds the reality - when companies and individuals talk of self-driving cars being commonplace in a few years' time, it's quite clear that this could only be the case in a tightly controlled environment.One example, that Mitchell explores in considerable detail are so-called adversarial attacks, a particularly AI form of hacking where, for example, those in the know can make changes to images that are invisible to the human eye but that force an AI system to interpret what they are seeing as something totally different. It's a sobering thought that, for example, by simply applying a small sticker to a stop sign on the road - unnoticeable to a human driver - an adversarial attacker can turn the sign into a speed limit sign as far as an AI system is concerned, with potentially fatal consequences.Don't get me wrong, Mitchell, a professor of computer science who has specialised in AI, is no AI luddite. But unlike many of the enthusiasts in the field (or, for that matter, those who are terrified AI is about to take over the world), she is able to give us a realistic, balanced view, showing us just how far AI has to go to come close to the more general abilities humans make use of all the time even in simple tasks. AI does a great job, for example, in something like Siri or Google Translate or unlocking a phone with a face - but AI systems still have no concept of, for example, understanding (as opposed to recognising) what is in an image. Mitchell makes it clear that where systems learn from large amounts of data, it is usually impossible to uncover how they are making decisions (which makes the EU's law requiring transparent AI decisions pretty much impossible to implement), so we really shouldn't trust them with important outcomes as they could easily be basing their outcomes on totally irrelevant inputs.Apart from occasionally finding the explanations of the workings of types of neural network a little hard to follow, the only thing that made me raise an eyebrow was being told that Marvin Minsky 'coined the phrase ""suitcase word""' - I would have thought 'derived* the phrase from Lewis Carroll's term ""portmanteau word""' would have been closer to reality.There have been good books on the basics of AI already, and excellent ones on the problems that 'deep learning' and big data systems throw up. But without a doubt, Mitchell's book sets a new standard in giving an understanding of what's possible and how difficult it is to go further. It should be read by every journalist, PR person and politician before they pump out yet more hype on the AI future. Recommended."

2,0374257833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30303418-steve-agland,5,"This book should be widely read, especially by those with a technological or philosophical interest in artificial intelligence, which should be most people. It provides a succinct history of this ambitious thought-provoking field, and a beautiful overview of the current state of the art. It should be accessible to anyone unafraid of a little mathematics. Since it is such a quickly evolving field, this latter aspect may grow out of date rather quickly.But most importantly, this book is a well-argued reality check: a bucket of cold water. (You know what I mean by that analogy, but can a computer?) AI is a technological endeavour, and like other big sci-fi dreams - deep space travel, cheap clean energy, transhumanism - there is an enormous gap between our current capability (impressive though it is) and our vividly imagined end point. It's a gap that's easy to dismiss while breathlessly fretting over superintelligence and singularities, but that gap is filled with some extremely difficult challenges that we currently have little idea how to approach, let alone solve.Mitchell's prologue sets up the book as a quest to understand what is really going on in AI research, spurred by a colourful example of the starkly opposing views found in debates within and around the field. She recounts a visit by legendary AI researcher and author Douglas Hofstadter to Google's headquarters to give a talk. Hofstadter wrote ""Godel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid"" - a famous meditation on AI and the nature of human consciousness, which was a significant influence on many geeks, including both your humble reviewer and the author of this book. Mitchell sought out Hofstadter as a mentor as a result of reading it. Anyway, Hofstadter spoke to the younger hotshot Googlers of his aching anxiety that when general AI comes, it will reveal human consciousness as something not so special. Something explainable and easy to simulate. This was an unexpected departure from the usual AI-will-destroy-us/no-it-won't dichotomy. The Googlers, for the most part, also shared the faith that general AI was in some sense imminent, but that it would be a boon to society, and the existential angst didn't factor into their thinking.The topic of AI inspires a lot of this sort of philosophising  - as it should - and much has been written on it. But like all such high-concept scientific pondering, it's healthy to rest it on a bedrock of hard technical reality. This book provides that reality. How far have we really got on the quest to build our own replacement?Mitchell begins with sketch of the history of AI research from its birth in the 1950s, and outlines its key figures and main ideological branches. These are broadly classified as symbolic (programmed facts and rules for inferring new facts, analogous to conscious reasoning) and subsymbolic (biologically inspired structures which learn patterns and rules via lots of example data, analogous to subconscious learning). Early on the symbolists were the dominant sect, but the pendulum has swung dramatically in the other direction in the last decade or two thanks to the runway success of ""deep learning"".For a more detailed survey of the many approaches to the challenge of AI, I recommend ""The Master Algorithm"" by Pedro Domingos, who is quoted a number of times in this book.Mitchell then begins her coverage of the current state of the industry with a deep dive into its hottest algorithm (you hated that pun, but could a computer?). Deep neural networks are now being used everywhere, from image recognition, to automated translation, to self-driving cars. Their success has lead many to speculate that this is significant step toward the holy grail of ""general AI"" - that is, a system that can learn a wide range of domains and function in them all simultaneously.But Mitchell identifies a number of fatal flaws in current techniques that will limit how far they can be taken. And there are no obvious or easy solutions.Deep neural networks are very good at learning patterns from training data, but even with ""big data"" quantities of examples there will always be the ""long tail"" of rare or one-off exceptions that will cause deep neural networks to fail spectacularly. Just think of the sorts of strange things that might happen in the road in front of a self-driving car. These can cause bizarre and unpredictable outputs because the system has no ""common sense"" understanding of the world to fall back on.Similarly, such networks after vulnerable to malicious attack. Carefully designed and small changes to input data can induce incorrect responses, sometimes tuned to the attacker's wishes. Interestingly the changes can be so subtle that a human observer wouldn't notice the difference. This implies that the algorithms aren't really understanding the input, at least not in the way we do.And one of the most frustrating shortcomings of deep neural networks is their inability to ""explain"" their results. They may give correct answers but we don't know how they reached that answer, at least not in any conceptually meaningful way.Mitchell's explanation of the ideas behind the recent breakthrough at playing the came of ""go"" - that is, DeepMind's AlphaGo - was a very satisfying example of how various algorithmic techniques can be combined to yield spectacular results, albeit in narrow domains. AlphaGo combined deep neural networks with reinforcement learning, and Monte Carlo tree searching.Likewise, the survey of the successes and failures in the domain of natural language processing were fascinating, and provided the clearest example of the roadblock that's looming ahead in many of these subfields: that is, that current AI systems don't really understand the world. They don't understand what the words they are processing refer to. That difficult to articulate mapping between a word like ""drink"" and the abstract concept of a drink that we humans so easily grasp.The final part of the book has a couple of chapters on these critical missing puzzle pieces. One of the key skills we employ so effortlessly as humans, but which has proven so difficult to train into a computer, is that of making analogies. We instantly recognise objects or situations as instances of a abstract idea (drinks, arguments, friends, accidents) and draw upon our experience with similar instances and applying them to new situations. We easily spot the pertinent ""sameness"" between two instances of a thing, and understand which differences are relevant and which aren't. As such we can generalise our knowledge powerfully. We haven't figured out how to get a machine to do this well.Mitchell rounds out the book with a ""self interview"", in the style of Godel Escher Bach, where she asks herself many of the ""big questions"" related to AI and uses this to summarise her conclusions. She makes a compelling case using insider knowledge, copious examples, quotes from other leading thinkers, and an entertaining wry wit. ""And if any computers are reading this, tell me what ""it"" refers to in the previous sentence, and you're welcome to join in the discussion."""
3,0374257833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/86576157-minervas-owl,4,"What I have learned:	• The intuition behind neural network, CNN, RNN, word2vec, and reinforcement learning.	• The distinction between symbolic and subsymbolic AI. The symbolic AI (e.g., solver for the Missionaries and Cannibals problem, expert systems) solves problems by applying human-interpretable concepts, the subsymbolic AI (e.g., the perceptron, deep learning) solves problems without using such concepts.	• Don't be too psyched by promises of AI such as ""The Singularity is Near""; we've seen repeating cycle of AI Spring and Winter since the 1950s.	• The recent successes of deep learning are still examples of ""narrow"" AI. For instance, AlphaGo cannot do anything other than playing Go.	• Even in each of their narrow field, the current AI systems are not perfect: they tend to perform poorly in a long tail of low-probability and unexpected events. They are also vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Not to mention the ethical challenges they encounter.	• AI performs poorly in challenges that test its understanding of the rich meaning of a situation. Examples of such challenges include the Winograd schemas, the Bongard problem, and why a photo is funny.	• What makes humans different from AI are: 1) common sense, a.k.a., the core intuitive knowledge of physics, biology, and psychology (e.g., parts of an object tend to move together) 2) the capabilities of abstraction and analogy.	• Because researchers have been struggling for decades to understand and reproduce common sense, abstraction, and analogy, we are still far, far away from creating general human-level AI. Pros of the book:The book is an easy read. One can enjoy it without prior knowledge of AI methods such as deep learning. The author offers adequate intuitive explanations of state-of-the-art AI methods. The writing is clear and straightforward. The introduction of Winograd schemas, Bongard problem, and Hofstadter's string analogy puzzles are enchanting. Cons:The essence of the book is not fully elaborated until it reaches part V, the last three chapters. The first 230 pages before part V read like a deep-learning crash course interlaced with news stories. I think the crash course is necessary, but the author could be skimp on AI history and anecdotes. The book could offer a more in-depth analysis of certain topics, such as why CNN and RNN are vulnerable to adversarial examples, and how programs such as Copycat and Metacat could make analogies. I also wish the book could talk more about unsupervised deep learning. Perhaps I am being a bit too harsh because of my wrong expectation. I read the book because I thought as a student of Hofstadter, Melanie Mitchel will offer some insightful philosophical analysis. But in fact, she is a professor in computer science rather than in philosophy. She intentionally planned to ""entirely sidestep the question of consciousness, because it is so fraught scientifically."" Overall, I think the book is worth reading. Although not in the way I expected, the book has delivered what it had promised: an overview of the frontier of AI to the general audience. My reading experience has encouraged me to read Melanie's books on genetic algorithms and complexity as well. Stray observations:	• Humans are also susceptible to our own types of ""adversarial examples"", such as visual illusions.	• Superstitions can be understood as a result of over-fitting in reinforcement learning.	• One way to assess the challenge of a domain for computers is to see how well simple algorithms such as random search and genetic algorithms perform on it. "
4,0374257833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68216674-pantelis-pipergias-analytis,4,"Melanie Mitchell provides an excellent summary of the current endeavours across fields in AI and an interim (bleak) assessment of the field's progress towards the holy grail of strong AI. Mitchell discusses recent milestones reached by AI (most based on approaches using some form of deep learning) taking a critical point of view, devoid of sensationalism as encountered in the media. Mitchell’s writing is lucid and engaging: many technical concepts are explained in clear and vidid language. What’s more, Mitchell is one of Douglas Hofstadter most successful students. Thus, the book may also read as as follow up to Hofstader's ""GEB: an Eternal Golden Braid"". Frequent references to Hofstadter's views on AI and to GEB are dispersed throughout the book and substantiate this interpretation. A lot has happened since GEB was originally published, and Mitchell's book can provide a much needed synthesis and constructive discussion of both Hofstader's ideas and the current state-of-art approaches for re-creating intelligence. The book covers many areas of AI, especially considering the astounding growth of the field, but there were sections that could be further developed: for instance, the section on creativity at the end was interesting and could be developed in a stand-alone chapter. Notwithstanding, Mitchell’s AI is bound to entertain readers across disciplines and can become an accessible and balanced entry point to research on AI for a wide audience. "
5,0374257833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6968193-jake,5,"I read this cover to cover in about two sittings, first book I've done like that in a while. There's a lot of pop science books out about AI and machine learning and a lot of them aren't very good. This is intelligent but not obscure, conversational to the point that it's almost gossipy it reads like a quanta article if they delve just a bit deeper into their subject. Whether it's the cheating controversies or the history of AIs for games to the speculative portions in the later part of the book, I found it all engrossing and perfectly succinct. When my friends express their fears about the singularity or artificial intelligent this will be the book I give to them."

The author writes in a style that allows both those who have a background in AI to gain new insight and those who have little to no background to follow along (I understand the basics but am by no means an expert and I had little to no trouble understanding). The author also does an excellent job of explaining misconceptions that exist about the field of AI and giving us a thoughtful look at the future of this field. Whether you are someone who is interested in going into the field or someone who fears the 'uprising', this book is an excellent place to start reading. Definitely recommended!"
8,0374257833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/917269-thomas,4,Excellent summary and overview of the current state and challenges facing artificial intelligence. Should be readily accessible to any interested reader without requiring pre-existing knowledge of the field.
9,0374257833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20465079-tam,4,"Wow, what a great read. No matter who you are, in this modern world it is highly likely that you are involved one way or another with AI. AI is so ubiquitous that at some point I want to dismantle the seemingly impenetrable barrier and peek inside a bit beyond the simplest definition. This book does exactly that, with such clarity.And it offers more than that. Besides providing some basic notions of various algorithms in AI, Mitchell brings into the table an in depth discussion of the overall picture of the field, with her many years experience in the field as an academic researcher. She doesn't have a relentless confidence in AI and its wild promises. At the same time she doesn't talk as if the endeavor is inevitably doomed. The balance is hard to kept, and is kept.I have been a bit skeptical of the current achievements of AI. Mostly I have been afraid of the misuse and the intransparency. Mitchell certainly mentions those aspects, but she further clarifies all the shortcomings without being dramatic or sensational. I realize I should be even more concerned. Most if not all applications are so fragile to attack (hacking), and I tremble to think of consequences. Yes, some applications are extremely useful, but in the end the utmost importance lies in how humans regulate the scope of the use of AI. I think everyone should read this book, especially policy makers, especially young applied computer scientists.At the same time, the beauty of the book is that Mitchell helps to elucidate how ""intelligent"" humans are. Many things we consider easy turns out so gruellingly hard to analyze not to mention to recreate in a machine. I think of Kahneman and his Fast Thinking system. Oh yeah, we humans are trying to compete with nature that has been building intelligent life for a few billion years. Of course it is hard."
10,0374257833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1667021-may-ling,4,"Summary: Melanie Mitchell's guide is approachable in its coverage of where the world is at in AI as of 2019. I love that it presents a balanced view and as a practitioner, she doesn't try to sell AI as doing more than it currently can. p. 5 - Funny that she's getting lost in the Google Maps building. Ha!p. 13 - Hofstadter's terror had to do with making humanity mundane more than a few of AI. p. 35 - Back Propagation (She references Perceptrons) - ""is a way to take the error observed at the output units (for example, a high confidence for the wrong digit in the example of figure 4) and to 'propogate' the blame for that error backward (in figure 4, this would be right to left) so as to assign proper blame to each oft he weights in the network."" I have no idea what she's saying, but I think basically when you realize that one layer is wrong, you then refit the previous layers. p. 53 - On how AI will be created: ""...we will set up an intricate hierarchy of self-organizing systems, based largely on the reverse engineering of the human brain, and then provide for its education ... hundred if not thousands of times faster than the comparable process for humans."" p. 73 - WordNet provides something that appears to be similar to word networks.p. 72 ImageNet - Object research for adding human labeled categories of photographs.p. 88 - ""With the proliferation of deep-learning systems in real-world applications, companies are finding themselves in need of a new labeled data set for training deep neural networks."" She uses the example of self-driving cars.p. 95 - The idea that people trust people in their cognitive perception but not AI. Intriguing.p. 102 - This shifts to the moral questions by starting to ask what decisions AI should be allowed to make (Prison sentences, evaluation of loan applications, etc).p. 154 - She gives the status on speech recognition and its current weaknesses in distinguishing voices, noices, etc.p. 160 Word2Vec, an intriguing concept of placing word vectors into space as a way of unwrapping mental processes surrounding understanding word meanings.p. 175 - Translating images into sentences via captioning. Yeah. I forgot, that is really crazy that the brain does that.p. 208 Cyc - the unwritten knowledge that humans have. It's the stuff that's so obvious we don't talk about it, but in fact, you need to b/c that's where you start with programming.p. 229 EMI's music algo.p. 236 - She's still thinking about the space as a burgeoning discipline. I think the implication that anyone thinks we're already there is that the scope of what needs to be accomplished is still actually quite a bit bigger. "

These include image recognition, game playing (like AlphaGo) and NLP systems like Google translate. The explanations for how those systems work are really good, with just the right amount of technical detail. We also get to see what the weak points of these systems are, and how far away we are from creating any true intelligence.I have written quite a long review/summary of it on my blog: https://henrikwarne.com/2020/05/19/ar..."
14,0374257833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19338561-eric,2,"This felt like an 8th grade science report, and much of the writing was laughably bad. What became an entire book, perhaps ought to have been a blog post and a bibliography.There was far too much of this pattern: “here’s what I’m about to say”; some casual, repetitive exposition; and “I just said”; littered with plenty of “as I said before”. I can do without all the prefacing and summary, thanks very much.While I fully appreciate this sort of accesible, high-level overview is important and valuable, that doesn’t mean I have to praise it and its lack of depth, style, and quality.I recommend this if you’re bored and wanting something mildly interesting, but fairly mindless, to read. Or if you’re ignorant of developments in computer science and AI in the last 60 years or so. Reach for something like GEB, or even one of the Manning books on machine learning, instead, if you prefer to think and be challenged."

Melanie Mitchell is no stranger to the field (she did her Ph.D with Douglas Hofstadter, and, quite some years ago, published the best book about Genetic Algorithms you can find). She's quick to pinpoint the limits of current Neural Network (CNNs, RNNs, DQNs) centric approaches to AI, highlighting the need to overcome the ""barrier of meaning"" and search for models that could work with 'common sense' knowledge and the capacity for sophisticated abstraction and analogy making.

22,0374257833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15753772-jonathan,4," I won this book in a First Reads Giveaway. I received an advanced reader copy, so some features (such as an index) are going to be modified or added before final publication.This book covers the history of artificial intelligence, several of its uses, and the algorithms that make it work. It also includes Professor Mitchell's ideas about the philosophy, ethics, and future of AI. It is written in a very clear style that never gets too technical. You don't need to be a computer scientist to be able to understand this book, which is divided into five sections: the history of AI, how its been used for image processing, playing games (such as chess and go), natural language processing, and what would make a machine truly ""intelligent"". These sections include clear descriptions of several ways to program AI, including symbolic AI, subsymbolic AI, perceptrons, neural networks, deep learning, convolutional neural networks, Q-learning, Monte Carlo tree search, and recurrent neural networks. Again, even though these seem like complicated terms, the book never gets too technical. There are only a couple of places where Professor Mitchell goes into a lot of detail; these subsections can be skipped without affecting the reader's understanding of the rest of the chapter.The best part of this book is that Professor Mitchell presents much of it as a relatable story. She includes her own history and experiences with AI, and quotes many other AI experts, including her mentor, Dr. Douglas Hofstadter. Professor Mitchell repeatedly emphasizes that, even though there have been a number of AI programs, including IBM's Watson, that have been advertised as performing at near-humans levels, this is mainly hype. While machines are very good at the very specific domain(s) for which they are programmed, slight modifications to the domains cause the machines to perform poorly. Professor Mitchell's message is that for machines to be truly intelligent, they must be able to apply what they've learned to different domains, and they must be capable of understanding what it is they have done, rather than just doing what they are programmed to do.There are only three ways that I feel that this book can improve. The book has many images, but they are all in black and white. Some of the images would be more illustrative and clear if they were in color. Also, this book could use a glossary, redefining important terms, including the terms which I listed above. Finally, Professor Mitchell focuses on subsymbolic AI. Even though most of the recent (as of 2019) advances in AI use subsymbolic AI, there is still a large community that studies uses symbolic AI. I feel that a larger section on symbolic AI uses would be beneficial.This book is a very easy read on a very complex topic."
23,0374257833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/811989-douglas-summers-stay,3,"After reading a terrible review of this book (the author of the review tried to shoehorn it into what was clearly their usual way of tackling every assignment, seeing the problems with AI through the lens of gender and race inequality) I was curious about what the book actually had to say. Melanie Mitchell was one of Douglas Hofstadter's students, and takes his perspective on a lot of questions. I've been a fan of his books for a long time-- they helped me get into AI in the first place-- but in recent years he's seemed more out of touch. So I was curious to know what criticisms his camp would have of the current state of the art.Mitchell does an admirable job of explaining the current capabilities and limitations of deep neural networks, image recognition, captioning, question answering, self-driving, and so forth. She gives a fair assessment of how far we have come and how much there is still to do on each of these problems. Very little in these sections was new to me, but I didn't find any mistakes, either.However, her main criticism, that these programs lack common sense, has in the last year (since she wrote the book) come increasingly under attack. One of the chapters, for example, uses (as a key piece of evidence of the lack of common sense in current systems) the Allen Institute's more difficult question answering challenge, stating that the current state of the art is 45% (25% is chance). That was true in December 2018. Now, in December 2019, the leaderboard is at 68%. Since these problems require common sense to solve, does this mean that we have now captured common sense? Well, yeah. Some of it. Just not all of it, and inconsistently applied. But if Mitchell can't see one year into the future accurately, her negative view is perhaps not that big of a problem. She has correctly identified what the major gap in AI research is, and the necessity of solving it for most AI problems, and recognizes that other AI researchers are also starting to focus on that gap. Her expectation that we won't make quick progress on it, though, I think is incorrect.It may just be a matter of what she is emphasizing, though, rather than any real disagreement. The closest she comes to giving dates by which something like human intelligence might be possible are that it won't happen before 2029 (the date Kurzweil estimates), and that you should ""take your estimate and double it, triple it, quadruple it."" So, in that case, she's saying Kurzweil should say 2059 instead. Which would put her estimate right around when most people in the field would guess.If her book helps to drive other researchers to work on these common sense problems, though, it will be a very good thing."
24,0374257833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35290471-andrew-fairweather,4,"“If you use machine translation—and I do so myself—you should take the results with a grain of salt. In fact, when I had Google Translate translate ‘take it with a grain of salt’ from English to Chinese and then back to English, it told me to ‘bring a salt bar.’ That might be a better idea.”The above quote is from one of the funniest parts of Melanie Mitchell’s incredibly readable introduction to AI for laypeople like myself—the quote is, I think, a pretty neat summary of Mitchell’s position on the uses of AI at this point in time. Her book debunks myths and hysteria, and is very sober and grounded in its treatment, while also being able to recognize the undeniable successes of AI. Mitchell’s book also has a sense of humor! The above quote is meant to communicate the difficulty of AI projects to have a sense of idiom… which is just the beginning of the current limitations of AI, which broadly includes the inability for metacognition. These limitations are often overshadowed by the media sayings things like “AI surpasses human cognition” or something like that, which is a complete mischaracterization. As Mitchell states late into the book, “A recurring recipe for AI research goes like this: Define a relatively narrow, though useful, task and collect a large data set for testing machine performance on this task. Perform a limited measure of human ability on this data set. Set up a competition in which AI systems can vie to outperform one another on this data set, until the human performance measure it met or exceeded. Report not only on the genuinely impressive and useful achievement, but also claim, falsely, that the winning AI systems have humanly-level performance on a more general task (for example, “reading comprehension”).”Especially useful for a newcomer to understanding AI was the difference between symbolic and subsymbolic AI. Symbolic AI is super logical, but only works in environments where there exists explicit rules and a sort of walled garden of understanding. Rules are the name of the game in symbolic AI. Subsymbolic AI is less about logic and more about pattern recognition.Symbolic systems were popular in the early days of AI because subsymbolic systems are pretty much useless unless there are massive amounts of data (patterns) to draw from—the fact that we now have more data than we know what dot do with has led to the current popularity of subsymbolic projects.Symbolic projects have since, for the most part, gone by the wayside.“Deep learning” is a term I’m sure most people have heard of by now. Deep learning is a technique within the realm of subsymbolic AI systems that relies on labeled data sets to train systems to recognize patterns. So far, the abilities for AI through deep learning subsymbolic techniques to master difficult executions is truly remarkable. But Mitchell reminds us of a saying that anyone familiar with AI will probably be aware of—what is difficult for human beings is easy for AI… but what is easy for human beings is difficult for AI.What this means is that an AI system might be able to beat a grand master at chess, but it will be unable to make a lateral move and take what it has experienced in a game of chess and apply it to other technical spheres or “life”. The ability to do this is what people in the feild call “general AI” and, according to Mitchell, we are very, very far off from achieving the capacity for general AI, the “holy grail” for AI researchers.But even apart from achieving general AI, even focused tasks such as image recognition are sketchy for AI at this stage simply because these systems are not always reliable. Slight alterations to images which look identical to human beings may throw AI systems completely off… Mitchell’s distinction between the importance of *reliability* of AI, rather than super-intelligence, is the issue. Again, easy is hard and hard is easy when it comes to AI. “Common sense” is another word for the essence of what is needed for AI to become reliable—and AI, so far, lacks common sense. They also lack reflection. An AI system may be able to provide you an answer (answer extraction). But even if it is technically correct, the system will in no meaningful sense be able to tell you *why*, or *how* or reflect on the philosophical ramifications of the answer. AI cannot “show its work.” For instance, an AI system geared towards getting a high score in the game *breakout* (and example Mitchell uses) might be able to do just that—get a high score quickly… but it will not be able to define the tools of the game. It will not be able to define “paddle,” “ball,” or have a sense of what “tunneling” through “brick” means. Most importantly, it will not be able to enjoy its victory….A part of this is that common sense and reflection, that is, the ability to easily draw from past experience to exercise intuitive judgement, requires the complexity of the human intellect.A part of this ability to reflect is the ability to “change our minds.” Since AI only puts out what it receives in a very narrow sense, AI can have a tendency to amplify biases on our society—and spending on the scope of application, this can have disastrous consequences. Mitchel points out that it can also open up questions about what sort of purpose AI would serve. I quote,“Should the data sets being used to train AI accurately mirror our own biased society—as they often do now—or should they be tinkered with specifically to achieve social reform aims? And who should be allowed to specify the aims or do the tinkering?”We can see here then, that AI at this point does not free us from the heavy questions of values and social aims. But aside from these more grand social aims, it is always a question for the AI engineer as to what extent their project is informed by exploring new actions for its system, and how much it should try to rather exploit tried-and-true actions. This balance between exploration and exploitation of AI projects is crucial, and has, I believe, further complicates the already potentially extreme social consequences of AI.Most of all, I enjoyed Mitchell’s bigger picture point about how the quest for general AI has challenged our ideas of what we call “intelligence.” Generally speaking, as soon as a machine learns to do a task, we no longer popularly understand “answer extraction” as necessarily requiring intelligence. The marker of true intelligence then becomes the ability to *reflect* on answers and be able to show why we come to certain conclusions. My own conclusion as a public librarian is this—that literacy remains as crucial as ever in the age of AI. Nothing is a substitute of literacy—and if we trust Mitchell’s well-reasoned projects, it’ll be a good, long while yet before AI becomes thoughtful *for* us. But is this a desirable state of affairs? I shouldn’t think so…In conclusion, until an AI project can define was “it” is, we’ve a long way to go… great book!"

26,0374257833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2412666-mangoo,4,"Artificial intelligence is once again a hype - this time much, much bigger than in previous AI ""springs"". This book was written by an academic expert, famous for her prior books introducing to genetic algorithms and complexity a wide readership. This time Melanie Mitchell tasked herself with finding out whether the current megalomaniac claims by AI shareholders that fill daily newspapers and research proposals are true. In a nutshell, the answer is: they are not, as far as claims that (human) general intelligence has been reproduced by machines, and there is still (as always, one might add) a long, long way ahead in that direction; however this does not mean that progress in recent years has not been phenomenal and unprecedented. The main merit for the giant steps ahead in artificial execution of well-defined and narrow tasks (once considered synonim of intelligence, as long as the tasks were not accomplished or ""solved"") in the last decade needs to be attributed to deep neural networks, which subtend what is misleadingly called deep learning (why measleading? because there is nothing really deep, in the gnoseologic sense, in the performance of these networks and in the knowledge they manipulate). Well, it turns out that such networks, and particularly their most successful version, the convolutional one, were invented already at the end of the '70s and established in the '80s by Yann LeCun, and the reasons that they suddenly became so dominating are 1) enormous computational resources available to big companies, and 2) huge amount of (labelled) data collected mostly surreptitiously from human actions and choices via apps and browsing internet.Given these ingredients, and the alchemical and remunerative art of training such networks and tuning their hyperparameters, most things follow: improved performance in such tasks as natural language processing, language translation, picture classification and automated caption making, game playing (with the example of Go, and even Warcraft (not covered in this book)), self-driving cars, automatic music composition, and a lot more. Big data, big computation, big money, big claims. What could possibly go wrong? Here we go again with the apocaliptic claims, that now more than ever seem to align with the infamous Singularity and with post-humanism.The book presents some history of AI (from the Darthmout meeting in 1955 with McCarthy and Minsky to the book of Papert and Minsky on perceptrons that caused the first AI ""winter"", before the resurrection of interest in networks with the introduction of backpropagation to train multi-layer networks, to more recent topics of great interest like value alignment, unsupervised learning (particularly deep Q-learning), and ethical issues), and starts and finishes with memories from a meeting of Douglas Hofstadter at Google in 2014, where he admitted to be ""terrified"" by what he was seeing around and that when they were working on AI in past decades the perspectives were so distant that noone taught it would have really happened within their lifetimes. Mitchell is appreciative of the huge leaps in AI performance of last years, and admits (like Hofstadter) to have been wrong in the past about some potentialities of AI. At the same time, she cannot avoid to note that most of the largest claims (general human-level intelligence, extrapolation to non-native tasks) are not (yet?) grounded: all tasks solved by AI are very well defined (eminently, games), contrary to real life; learning does not correspond to transfer learning in AI, contrary to humans; the possible learning iterations in real life are limited; the most powerful tools, namely deep neural networks, are hardly intelligible and the knowledge they encode cannot easily nor generally be unfolded into common language; what they ""learn"" is not really understood not it can be always predicted (learning something is necessarily associated with learning something else, which reminds of the spandrel example by Fodor and Piattelli-Palmerini abou the philosophical fallacy of (neo-)Darwinism); they can be trolled by ""adversarial"" examples (ad hoc, or indistinguishable) that would never instead troll a thinking human, so that in general they cannot or should not be trusted (while we have already started attributing them a lot of power in practice); they are very superficial in their correlational way of learning patterns, and they do not have a ""deep"" real understanding of the object of their knowledge; they miss common sense; and to top it off, their wide(r) adoption should first pass through the solution of ethical dilemmas, which in turn would require clear answers to long-standing human inquires and estimates of values.Just like the original proposal of the group of Darthmout in 1955 would still be original and valid as of today as far as topics and aspiration, the list of issues recounted by Mitchell is as old, and not big progress has actually been achieved in all big standing roadblocks toward human-level intelligence by artificial means. The book ends on a theme dear to the author, namely analogy and methaphors, and alludes in several places that such lack of real understanding in machines is due to their disembodiedness, hence the solution may need to pass through embodiment. Unfortunately the author do not delve into current status and research in this direction, which sees robotics playing a key role. And besides a few technical notes, the book entertains at a rather high level of technical description, so that it may disappoint some experts. Nonetheless, it provides very good literature in the references, and it bears the trademark clear and witty style of the authors.All in all, a worth read that keeps the promise of the title."
27,0374257833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7226831-josh-friedlander,5,"I discovered this via David Auerbach's recommendation, and it is a gem: a conversational, crystal-clear book that inherits some of Mitchell's mentor Douglas Hofstadter's enthusiasm, but with more of a sense of the readers's patience. (A friend says no one has ever finished Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid. I vaguely seem to remember finishing it, but don't remember much after the early sections about recursion.)I'd say I knew a lot of the material covered here, but still enjoyed seeing Mitchell pull it together, connecting the historical progress of AI from its inception (John McCarthy and Symbolic AI) to today's landscape of souped-up neural networks vacuuming up VC cash, and filled in some gaps (her explanation of DeepMind's ""Q-Learning"" system, which allowed them to feed Atari games into a CNN, was very helpful). I should stress that no mathematical or programming knowledge is required for this book, and Mitchell's explanatory skills are superb.In some ways the bête noire of this book is futurist Ray Kurzweil. Mitchell is somewhat sceptical about ""Artificial General Intelligence"", but modestly acknowledges that as she has been wrong in past predictions she might be wrong again. (Strong opinions, lightly held, as they say). The paradox at the heart of this book was expressed by AI pioneer John McCarthy as ""as soon as it works, no one calls it AI anymore"". On the one hand, goal after goal has been set up as achievable only by human-level intelligence, only to be beaten by AI (the highest-profile recent one being the defeat of Go champion Lee Sedol by a Google program, and his subsequent retirement). On the other, we still feel that this isn't the real thing - AI fails miserably at a lot of tasks simple for humans. Another quote from a major AI figure, Marvin Minsky: ""easy things are hard”. Mitchell takes the side of programmer Mitch Kapor in his Long Bet against Kurzweil, again expressing openness to the idea that she may be wrong. I’m on Mitchell’s side too, and this book is a tonic against the relentless hype (Mitchell punctures some of IBM’s desperate, highly misleading marketing of their various Watson products, trying to convey immense capability on the back of their ballyhooed Jeopardy win.)On AI ethics, Mitchell covers some of Cathy O'Neil's ground much more sensibly, noting potential issues but seeing them more as implementation parameters than as fundamental to the technology (though a cynic might note that Mitchell is a researcher, O’Neil a former practitioner). I’d add (my own thoughts, not hers) that critiques of facial recognition are contradictory: either that it isn’t good enough, or that it's too good. If the first (eg some systems are bad at recognising black people), that's just a trivial engineering problem (train models on more non-white people!) If that it's liable to flag people inaccurately: we already have a model called ""personal names"" that can flag people inaccurately (this happened to a friend who was stopped crossing a South American border because she shared a name with a criminal). This is not a big deal, just like ""deepfakes"" aren't a bigger deal then Photoshop - people will just adjust their priors and learn to be more sceptical. But if the issue is that if the tech does work, it's a fundamental violation of civil rights - that's an intriguing claim deserving of consideration. But then we should treat it like any constitutional question: the police should freely proceed, and when it inevitably ends up in the courts, judges - experts of matters of rights and law - will make the call, as they should.One quibble about the audiobook version: the narrator (Abby Craden) makes some risible errors in pronouncing symbols, such as top-5 as ""top minus 5”, and #CANNIBALS (where the hash stands for ""number of"") as ""hashtag cannibals"". (Mitchell reads the intro herself, which is great.) That aside: this is a brilliant, up-to-date book, which I’ll henceforth refer people to when they ask what I do!"
28,0374257833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/109980124-sal-gnvs,4,"Artificial Intelligence: A State-of-the-Art BookI came across this book through the EconTalk podcast from January 6th, 2020. The fascinating conversation between Melanie Mitchell and the economist Russ Roberts attracted me to read the book. Also, what should not be left unmentioned is that Mitchell worked with Douglas Hofstadter, a living legend in AI. Geeks, in particular, might be attracted to read Mitchell's book.Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the most fascinating and discussed technology for the past decade for its ultimate goal to mimic human intelligence. The book is divided into five parts by introducing the reader to AI from the past to the present. The book begins with a prologue, an anecdotal one as a starting point. Following a presentation of the roots of AI in Part I, the scientific developments are explored in Parts II and III, respectively. Then, Part IV investigates the challenges that AI is confronted with. The book closes with Part V, which examines a group of more applied questions of contemporary interest.Mitchell's book has a thorough, accessible and enjoyable introduction. For a layperson, the book offers an excellent overview of AI. Mitchell is an insider and gives the reader a realistic account of the state-of-the-art, coupled with sober analysis, epistemic humility, and a cautious outlook concerning AI's future. The focus of the book is of what is and not what ought to be; I appreciated this very much.What should not be left unmentioned are Mitchell's remarks on how difficult it is to make progress in AI. It is reiterated multiple times IN the book that ""easy things are hard"". I am particularly interested in issues within the realm of governance, markets, and society. Mitchell's idea of how to regulate AI is worth considering. Especially, regulators and scholars in this field should take note:""I believe that regulation of AI should be modeled on the regulation of other technologies, particularly those in biological and medical sciences, such as genetic engineering. In those fields, regulation—such as quality assurance and the analysis of risks and benefits of technologies—occurs via cooperation among government agencies, companies, nonprofit organizations, and universities. Moreover, there are now established fields of bioethics and medical ethics, which have considerable influence on decisions about the development and application of technologies. AI research and its applications very much need a well-thought-out regulatory and ethics infrastructure."" Currently, private actors regulate themselves which is also known as private governance. Private governance is not necessarily bad, but again Mitchell's approach regulating AI should be strongly considered.Overall, the book has given me a better understanding of AI. It's a book I recommend to everyone interested in actually learning something while reading it. Thus, the book deserves a four-star rating."
29,0374257833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32717494-venky,4,"René Descartes, a French philosopher, mathematician and scientist in elucidating his famous theory of dualism, expounded that there exist two kinds of foundation: mental and physical. While the mental can exist outside of the body, and the body cannot think. Popularly known as mind-body dualism or Cartesian Duality (after the theory’s proponent), the central tenet of this philosophy is that the immaterial mind and the material body, while being ontologically distinct substances, causally interact. British philosopher Gilbert Ryle‘s in describing René Descartes’ mind-body dualism, introduced the now immortal phrase, “ghost in the machine” to highlight the view of Descartes and others that mental and physical activity occur simultaneously but separately.Ray Kurzweil, the high priest of futurism and Director of Engineering at Google, takes Cartesian Duality to a higher plane with his public advocacy of concepts such as Technological Singularity and radical life extension. Kurzweil argues that with giant leaps in the domain of Artificial Intelligence, mankind will experience a radical life extension by 2045. Skeptics on the other hand bristle at this very notion, claiming such “Kurzweilian” aspirations to be mere fantasies putting to shame even the most ludicrous of pipe dreams.The advances in the field of AI have spawned a seminal debate that has a vertical cleave. On one side of the chasm are the undying optimists such as Ray Kurzweil predicting a new epoch in the history of mankind, while on the other side of the divide are placed pessimists and naysayers such as Nick Bostrom, James Barrat and even the likes of Bill Gates, Elon Musk and Stephen Hawking who advocate extreme caution and warn about existential risks. So what is the actual fact? Melanie Mitchell, a computer science professor at Portland State University takes this conundrum head on in her eminently readable book, ““Artificial Intelligence: A Guide for Thinking Humans.” A measured book, that abhors mind numbing technicalities and arcane elaborations, Ms. Mitchell’s work embodies a matter-of-fact narrative that seeks to demystify the future of both AI and its users.The book begins with a meeting organized by Blaise Agüera y Arcas, a computer scientist leading Google’s foray into machine intelligence. In the meeting, the genius AI pioneer and author of the Pulitzer Prize winning book, “Gödel, Escher, Bach: an Eternal Golden Braid” (or just “gee-ee-bee’), Douglas Hofstadter expresses downright alarm at the principle of Singularity being touted by Kurzweil. “If this actually happens, “we will be superseded. We will be relics. We will be left in the dust.” A former research assistant of Hofstadter, Ms. Mitchell is surprised to hear such an exclamation from her mentor. This spurs her on to assess the impact of AI, in an unbiased vein.Tracing the modest trajectory of the beginning of AI, Ms. Mitchell informs her reader about a small workshop in Dartmouth in 1956 where the seeds of AI were first sown. John McCarthy, universally acknowledged as the father of AI and the inventor of the term itself, persuaded Marvin Minsky, a fellow student at Princeton, Claude Shannon, the inventor of information theory and Nathaniel Rochester, a pioneering electrical engineer, to help him organize “a 2 month, 10-man study of artificial intelligence to be carried out during the summer of 1956.” What began as a muted endeavor has now morphed into a creature that is both revered and reviled, in equal measure. Ms. Mitchell lends a technical element to the book by dwelling on concepts such as symbolic and sub-symbolic AI. Ms. Mitchell, however lends a fascinating insight into the myriad ways in which various intrepid pioneers and computer experts attempted to distill the element of “learning” into a computer thereby bestowing it with immense scalability and computational skills.For example, using a technique termed, back-propagation, errors are taken away at the output units and to “propagate” the blame for that error backward so as to assign proper blame to each of the weights in the network. This allows back-propagation to determine how much to change each weight in order to reduce the error. The beauty of Ms. Mitchell’s explanations lies in its simplicity. She breaks down seemingly esoteric concepts into small chunks of ‘learnable’ elements.It is these kind of techniques that have enabled IBM’s Watson to defeat World Chess Champion Garry Kasparov, and trump over Jeopardy! Champions Ken Jennings and Brad Rutter. So with such stupendous advances, is the time where Artificial Intelligence surpasses human intelligence already upon us? Ms. Mitchell does not think so. Taking recourse to the views of Alan Turing’s “argument from consciousness,” Ms. Mitchell brings to our attention, Turing’s summary of the neurologist Geoffrey Jefferson’s quote:“Not until a machine can write a sonnet or compose a concerto because of thoughts and emotions felt, and not by the chance fall of symbols, could we agree that machine equals brain—that is, not only write it but know that it had written it. No mechanism could feel (and not merely artificially signal, an easy contrivance) pleasure at its successes, grief when its valves fuse, be warmed by flattery, be made miserable by its mistakes, be charmed by sex, be angry or depressed when it cannot get what it wants.”Ms. Mitchell also highlights – in a somewhat metaphysical manner – the inherent limitations of a computer to gainfully engage in the attributes of abstraction and analogy. In the words of her own mentor Hofstadter and his coauthor, the psychologist Emmanuel Sander, “Without concepts there can be no thought, and without analogies there can be no concepts.” If computers are bereft of common sense, it is not for the want of their users trying to ‘embed’ some into them. A famous case in point being Douglas Lenat’s Cyc project which ultimately turned out to be a bold, albeit futile exercise.A computer’s inherent limitation in thinking like a human being was also demonstrated by The Winograd schemas. These were schemas designed precisely to be easy for humans but tricky for computers. Hector Levesque, Ernest Davis, and Leora Morgenstern three AI researchers, “proposed using a large set of Winograd schemas as an alternative to the Turing test. The authors argued that, unlike the Turing test, a test that consists of Winograd schemas forestalls the possibility of a machine giving the correct answer without actually understanding anything about the sentence. The three researchers hypothesized (in notably cautious language) that “with a very high probability, anything that answers correctly is engaging in behaviour that we would say shows thinking in people.”Finally, Ms. Mitchell concludes by declaring that machines are as yet incapable of generalizing, understanding cause and effect, or transferring knowledge from situation to situation – skills human beings begin to develop in infancy. Thus while computers won’t dethrone man anytime soon, goading them on to bring such an endeavor to fruition might not be a wise idea, after all."

I'm in the ""runaway superintelligence is vanishingly improbable"" camp, but didn't get around to fully articulating my thoughts. Imagine my delight when I saw that a professional put my suspicions into powerfully precise words!Artificial Intelligence is two books in one, given in a very deliberate order. At first, it's just a plain language primer into how various ""AI' techniques work. Mitchell has put in the time, so it's able to go into the history and politics of the early AI scene while still getting the concepts across. This is useful enough for a book to do - these techniques have really become ubiquitous and knowing what forces have power over your life is good enough.But where it really shines is towards the end, when Mitchell dares us to think more about what intelligence actually is . While AI's accomplishments have been staggeringly impressive, they're enormously specialized and brittle in a way that is totally incomptable with general intelligence, and the book makes a compelling case that these are for deeply fundamental reasons that won't get fixed in a year or ten. Mitchell is no Luddite, but you don't need to be to want to be careful how much autonomy we cede to disembodied AIs while they have such wildly variable outcomes.I recommend this book to everybody, because everybody is now ruled by the forces the book describes, and it's important to know your enemy. "
31,0374257833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5456705-mindy-mcadams,5,"I cannot recommend this book enough. It offers an excellent, up-to-the-minute survey of the capabilities of artificial intelligence, the current state of the field, and sufficient background and underpinnings to show how we got to where we are today. The author, a professor and Ph.D. in computer science, writes for a general (and intelligent) audience, leaving out algorithms and programming languages from her explanations but providing well-chosen illustrations and diagrams that taught me more than all the other books and articles I've read on this topic.I was a bit skeptical during the first three chapters, when after saying she wouldn't dwell on the history of AI and its origins as a field, she seemed to be doing just that. In chapter 4, though, she dives into machine vision, what makes it hard to do, and how it works. From there on, it's a near-perfect book. The chapters build on one another and there's no redundancy. She's got new things to share right up to the very last page. And the rationale for those first three chapters becomes obvious, as the reader sees how they laid a foundation for later explanations.Best of all, the author deals with What is intelligence? and What does it mean to say a machine ""learns""? and ethics and even how AI can be maliciously subverted right within the main text, while she's discussing neural nets and natural language processing and IBM's Watson and AlphaGo — not as a separate, tacked on chapter. It's the kind of book where you appreciate how the author has spent years immersed in the subject, not in a narrow academic sliver of it but broadly as well as deeply.I'd give it 6 stars if I could. "
32,0374257833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47188208-volen-vladimirov,5,"In today's world, where AI is being used more and more, a book like this should be mandatory.People should have at least a basic knowledge of this technology. When someone says 'You're going to destroy the world with AI!' or 'Haven't you watched Terminator?' it's funny, but it also shows how little is understood about the field. Not to say that AI can't be dangerous. Of course not. But pondering whether we will become slaves to some robotic mastermind is more of a philosophical question at the moment. We are nowhere near superintelligence in AI. The biggest threat now is stupid machines. This quote by Pedro Domingos captures the concept:'People worry that computers will get too smart and take over the world, but the real problem is that they're too stupid and they've already taken over the world'AI is implemented into many tools that we use daily. If we're going to rely on these tools we should know how AI works. This book is a very good start. You will gain a good understanding of the state that AI is currently in and what it's capabilities are. You don't need to have more technical knowledge than the average person in order to understand the concepts and methods explained within. It's a much-needed introduction that a lot of journalists should read before publishing articles filled with misconceptions and false promises that just add to the confusion surrounding AI."

General (or human level) AI remains far off in the distance, will require new approaches (supervised learning will only get so far), and it isn’t clear how we’d recognize it if/when it happens.---The most fundamental challenge is that AI does not understand anything (“Barrier of meaning”). AI lacks the core knowledge/commonsense/intuitive understanding/mental models of the world that humans use to think abstractly, read between the lines, and predict what is likely to happen and what would happen if the event occurred. Because AI cannot understand, AI is unable to accomplish “easy” tasks, risks biases, cannot “transfer learning” from one task or domain to another, requires large and cleanly labeled data sets with black-and-white answers, may overfit the data, makes unpredictable errors, is susceptible to bias, cannot explain its results, and may be tricked in ways humans never would be.---Above all, the take-home message from this book is that we humans tend to overestimate AI advances and underestimate the complexity of our own intelligence….the most worrisome aspects of AI systems in the short term is that we will give them too much autonomy without being fully aware of their limitations and vulnerabilities.”"
34,0374257833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4142491-darko,5,"A great overview of the current state of AI - relatively accessible even if you're not in computer science, but still interesting enough if you are. It helps you understand the intuition behind the main techniques currently used in vision, gameplay, language processing (convolutional nets, reinforcement learning etc). Even more importantly, it explains the limitations (through adversarial examples) and the way results are measured in all these fields so you are able to read the media hype more critically.The author being a student of Douglas Hofstadter, she goes into philosophical parts a bit, but kinda avoids the hard question about AGI. It's understandable to me when non-engineers make fun of the topic (and it's true that AGI has been ""just 10 years away"" since the 50s). But I imagine a practitioner like the author should have a firmer opinion: it's either on the horizon (meaning visible next steps and, dare I say, some kind of expected timeline) or it's completely impossible to say, because we're still not sure there's not some immortal soul in humans or whatnot. Saying ""my intuition is it's going to take a really long time"" is weaseling out a bit.Nevertheless, a great read if you want to get up to speed with current AI."
35,0374257833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/94211106-anna,5,"Excellent. I am glad I read this book and would put it in my top recommended for this year. Artificial Intelligence discussed the history and current state of AI. At first I was worried that it would be too technical but Mitchell did an excellent job of explaining most topics so that the general population can understand. I have been interested in AI so I had a general understanding of the issues before reading but there were certain times that I was a bit confused. Luckily, the author would recommend sections to skip if the reader is unprepared for more technical topics. Mitchell also gave recommendations for future reading on specific topics if the reader is interested in specific issues of AI.This book gave incredible information in understanding AI and it's past, present and future. AI impacts virtually every person around the world and will only become more influential as technology progresses. Even if you don't care much for AI, you should know what it can, and cannot do. The involvement of AI in medicine, automotive, and numerous other industries is never ending. Overall, I highly recommend this book and am incredibly glad I read it."
36,0374257833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5967219-frank-heere,3,"The main reason that I wanted to read this book was that I absolutely loved Melanie Mitchell’s book Complexity. What I took away from that book is that she has a very good way of explaining and putting in perspective difficult topics at an accessible level.Artificial intelligence is not a topic that I would normally read a book about. Professionally I have come across uses of machine learning, so I am not completely unbeknown to parts of the subject.This book has left me with mixed feelings. Some parts where disappointing, other parts certainly lived up to my expectations. The book uses the history of the field to describe what is possible with AI and where the challenges are. The strengths of Mitchell come across when she explains what the technical aspects are of machine learning and neural networks. The main part of the book describes however limited the applications still are. A big take-away from the book is her opinion the general AI is still across the horizon. She builds her case giving multiple examples of specific useful applications that fail when confronted with situations where interaction with the world humans are living in is necessary. "
37,0374257833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67610833-john-crippen,3,"If Bostrom's Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies bothered you as much as it did me, you should read this book. Wow, we are a long way away from artificial general intelligence. Mitchell gives a review of where we are with AI, focusing (so to speak) on image recognition, learning, language, and understanding in general. On top of the author's accessible explanations of AI concepts and history, she is a longtime student and admirer of Douglas Hofstadter, so there are lots of fun references to hisGödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid."
38,0374257833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4163069-julie,4,"Not really up-to-date for 2020, but a good history of AI from the 1950s to about 2005, covering all the challenges and how many of them were overcome, and which still remain. I would like to see the author do a part two, an update that covers more recent developments. I know very little about computers, but I think you need to be of above-average intelligence to follow along with her discussions or be in the field of IT. I like how she explains that an AI can beat a chess master, but isn't smart enough to distinguish a dog from a cat in a picture, and why. Although computers still lack the basic human abilities of generalizing, understanding cause and effect, or transferring knowledge from one situation to another, I am in the camp that believes that someday they will, and that they will become indistinguishable from us except for one thing...they won't be irrational."
39,0374257833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7228323-raghu,4,"One of the more clear-eyed and technically-solid views on the current state of ""AI"" from an insider. This book had the opposite of the Murray Gell-Mann effect, where one can still nod in agreement about the popular science version of the field (without the usual cringing). It would have been nice to have better illustrations, given how beautiful graphics explaining concepts are so ubiquitously available now.Net, things that were thought to be hard (requiring ""high"" intelligence) are easy (for machines) and things that were taken to be easy are hard. Further, learning from data without hand-crafting rules turns out to work better than expected, but comes at the cost of human understanding of why it works."
40,0374257833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65164926-joe-born,5,"The broad context this book provides for someone interested in AI is hard to beat. My goal in reading this was to augment my technical understanding about machine learning, so that I'd have more context to understand where the field is going, how did we get here, etc, a kind of lay of the land that you don't get from the technical books and MOOC that give technical details, but no broader context. What did Watson or AlphaGo mean for the space? Imagine sitting down with a professor that has thoughtfully spent a career thinking about these things and having an intimate conversation answering the questions, ""where are we with AI? What is going on and what are the shortcomings? Where are things going?""It was just what I was looking for. "
41,0374257833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52956428-miguel-diz-lopes,5,"This book was such a joy to read. Finishing it with a greater understand of AI and its history, but mostly a reality check of where we're at. We're given a thoughtful look of where lies its future breakthroughs, and specially how far away we still are. AI systems can indeed go through huge amounts of data faster, quickly extract insights, improve itself in a way that we humans can't. The beauty of the book lies as it remembers how deeply complex our intelligence is, and how despite AI huge developments its still not comparable, and it might never be. I'm excited for a future in which tech keeps evolving and AI keeps getting more versatile and intelligent, as I'm sure it will be a keep becoming a greater partner to us humans. Hopefully also helping us become more unbiased and fair. "
42,0374257833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70776713-raj-sadasivam,5,"This book explains basic level of ai. Not very advanced. Can machines beat humans in intelligence? According to the author, not for a long time. But there immediate risks and dangers of machines doing human jobs like driving cars, medical diagnosis etc. The key point is machines cannot think and feel like humans. They cannot be judgemental. The key point i infer here is instead of building a human like general all purpose machines, researchers should build narrow but smarter ai that can help human race a whole and aid in solving problems like diseases, wars, crime, economic etc. They should leave human intelligence such as abstraction, analogy, creativity, mental prediction to humans rather than making machines imitate (or supersede) humans."
43,0374257833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23916723-daniel-aguilar,5,"Great and extensive review on AI, both technical, conceptual and philosophic. It explains different kinds of AI approaches (symbolic, expert systems, various types of neural networks...), their implementations, strengths and weakness. I specially enjoyed the chapters on the challenge of general AI, the idea of common sense, language, analogy, experience and embodiment. It also offers some considerations on ethics, risks and predictions, including her own thoughts and those of many other researchers in the field. All in all, a well balanced (not too deep, not too shallow) work: interesting, broad, understandable, engaging. I listened the audiobook version, which refers very frequently to the accompanying ebook for diagrams and illustrations."
44,0374257833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5220455-iver-band,5,"Thorough, Accessible and EnjoyableThis is a far-reaching account of the history, key concepts, algorithms, limitations and current state of AI along with the personal perspective of an accomplished academic researcher and teacher. The writing is very clear and is supported by numerous visual examples. As an data science student and practitioner and a reader of many books on AI, this one stands out for its clarity and holistic perspective seasoned with personal anecdotes and humor. I recommend this book both for those who seek an introduction to AI as well as students and practitioners who seek a broader perspective."
45,0374257833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76479849-michael-lucarelli,5,"Excellent read. After reading Kai-Fu Lee’s AI Superpowers, I was looking to get a better understanding of where we really are with AI and specifically Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) or where AI systems approach human level intelligence. Melanie Mitchell laid out a well supported story of the technical challenges that exist and why the challenges were significant in this guest. I particularly enjoyed her fact based narrative was void of subjective, judgmental, “pro & con” of AI especially the societal challenges. While I’m aware of many of the challenges AI may present, I’m also aware many are years or decades away from being manifested. "
46,0374257833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15854961-patrick-pilz,5,"I actually listened to the audiobook, which is not listed here on Goodreads for one reason or another. While the seductive female voice in the audiobook makes the content much more digestible, it is at times hard to listen to it when you do not have the PDF with the illustrations handy. So no walking the dog, or driving a car with this one.Over the course of 330 or so pages, the book explains in a very entertaining way the current state of research on AI and its challenges. While Melanie tries to explain the topic for the rest of us, it is at times challenging to follow along. Still, for most of us, a nice introduction into the promises and perils of artificial intelligence."
47,0374257833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5982358-derek-bridge,5,"I think this is the best of the recent slew of AI books targeted at the general reader. While I didn't much like the journalistic style of the Prologue, nor the excessive number of references to Douglas Hoftstadter throughout the book, the rest is superb. It serves as one possible history of the field, which also helps give the book a good narrative arc; it is a balanced account of the state-of-the-art (at least, for the general reader); its explanations have sufficient depth for the general reader without ever becoming impenetrable; and it offers a clear-sighted appraisal about the strengths and weaknesses of current AI and our prospects for the near future.Strongly recommended."
48,0374257833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/102946985-jacob-mainwaring,4,"I enjoyed this one, though I’ve already come across most of it at some point or another. It gives a brief historical overview of AI, focusing mostly on some recent advances (e.g., game playing, image classification and captioning, machine translation). Perhaps more importantly, though, it describes how much farther we have to go before reaching human level intelligence. Having context, understanding cause and effect, and being able to transfer skills across domains will all be important steps, and we should keep this in mind when sifting through singularity predictions and marketing hype that over-promise how far we’ve come. "
49,0374257833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/820074-lisa-wright,4,Mitchell offers a very human-friendly take on Artificial Intelligence. She covers the history in a lively manner and clearly explains the different approaches being used today. She also makes a convincing case that the AI apocalypse is still a long way in the future despite all the hype. Artificial General Intelligence still eludes the experts. We won't have free thinking machines until scientists can teach computers common sense. (For the other side of the argument try A WORLD WITHOUT WORK by Daniel Susskind. Due out January 2020)
50,0374257833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4073465-carlos-martinez,5,"Really enjoyed this popular but rigorous overview of the field of AI - the history, the science, the ethics, and the enormous challenges that remain as yet unsolved. Balanced, well-written, fact-based, and mercifully light on hyperbole (unlike most pop-sci literature in this area).I listened to the audiobook, but I'll have to go through the 'real thing' now, as the constant exhortations to ""refer to figure 29 in the PDF that accompanies this audiobook"" are difficult to comply with when cycling to work and erring on the side of not being crushed by a truck."
51,0374257833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68687395-wen-jun-ong,5,"This book is written for AI non-practitioner or commoner like you and me. For people that are interested in the latest developments of AI and its applications. This is the book for you. All the more so for AI skeptics as it lays out the limitations of different algorithms (symbolics system, Q-learning, ConvNet, Reinforcement learning, deep neutral networks).  The conclusion of the book can be summed up in the following sentence:  we humans tend to overestimate AI advances and underestimate the complexity of our own intelligence "
52,0374257833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14232243-gordon-fowler,5,An relatively easy to understand guide to the current state of AIThis is a great book for those who are not experts in AI to understand the current state of the art and some the current limitations to the practice. At the very least it is helpful for those that want to discern the difference between what is possible and what is a wild claim. I personally certify that a devious computer has not written this review to induce humans to underestimate the potential of AI and our coming world domination. 
53,0374257833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31408871-jan,4,"More of a 4.5 The concept of the book is very promising. Despite saying that this will not be a ""what is AI"" book the beginning is very much so. Covering all the aspects of thinking computer.Only towards the end does it go more into phylosophical and existencial questions that give food for thought.Maybe the reson for lower rating was the audibook. It is accompanied with pdf files for easier visual representation, but that means that you can not just listen to the book, you have to actively participate, so be warned for those willing to listen."
54,0374257833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60967627-roger-rosenberg,5,"Excellent analysis of artificial intelligence (AI)..Very detailed, but the author writes well and makes difficult concepts clear even to readers without detailed programming background. She makes clear what AI is and what it is not. In particular she cuts through the press hype to show Watson and Deep Blue are still far short of human abilities. The reader is left to his or her own predictions, but the author makes it clear we are decades short of true human-like general intelligence. This reviewer highly recommends this book on an important and timely topic. "
55,0374257833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22576651-kevin,5,Required reading for anyone making policy decisions involving computer algorithms or anyone interested in tech developments. This book turned me into an autonomous-vehicle skeptic after reading author Melanie Mitchell's descriptions of the current and near-future states of generalized AI research.Accessible to a wide audience with just enough technical details to satisfy the mathematically curious among us.
56,0374257833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9329903-michael,5,"If you read one book about AI this year, let this be it. Unlike so many of the other bestseller on the topic, this one actually talks about how modern AI systems work. And it also contains many thoughtful passages on the nature of intelligence. Mitchell is a fine writer, with an easy, conversational style, and a good ability to break down complex ideas from computer science into easily digestible explanations."
57,0374257833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/364576-steve-allison,5,"Nice closing quote: The impacts of AI will continue to grow for all of us. I hope that this book has helped you, as a thinking human, to get a sense of the current state of this burgeoning discipline including its many unsolved problems, the potential risks and benefits of its technologies, and the scientific and philosophical questions it raises for understanding our own human intelligence. And if any computers are reading this, tell me what it refers to in the previous sentence and your’re welcome to join in the discussion."

It is on the side of Kurzweil-sceptics that believe we are still far away from human-level AI.The only thing really new to me is the embodiment hypothesis, which says that for a human-level AI to evolve it needs a body to learn from its physical environment."
59,0374257833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/92109065-ceren-altincekic,5,This book is an amazing recap of the state of the art AI today. It is not a history of AI but it does touch upon the trajectory of AI developments in the past century. The author thoughtfully explains why AI is far from reaching human level capabilities in almost all domains it tackles and she suggests that we are very far from general AI.Anybody who is interested in AI should read this book.
60,0374257833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49538115-trace-reddell,3,"Used this for a graduate level seminar on ""Emergent Digital Cultures,"" and I found it pretty useful though not quite my usual style of text -- more technical than critical/theoretical. I found it a very helpful grounding into how AI works and its more-or-less current status. Ethical issues are touched on. Not sure I would use again as a text for this particular class, though."

I highly recommend this book!"
62,0374257833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28900628-spacebear,3,"Fantastic overview of the history of artificial intelligence, and the programming difficulties that come with trying to develop it. It was at times a bit theoretical and technical, which can make it a bit of a dry read (especially for those with no background in computer sciences). But I think people who are fascinated by the subject will enjoy the book."
63,0374257833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91504846-marcella-lucas,5,"The first few chapters are a bit tough going through the neural networks underlying AI, but it's well worth the effort. The book touches on all the current aspects of AI and gives the author's prediction of the implications of AI in the near and far future based on well researched papers, articles, interviews etc."

65,0374257833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32665189-brendan,4,"Threads the needle very well in allowing those not versed in the lore of AI, past and present, a good fixture point while still providing an enjoyable walk down memory lane for more experienced practitioners of the art of AI. It isn't quite ""a guide"" as it suggests, but rather a retrospective and a call for slowing down the hype train that is current ConvNet craziness."
66,0374257833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1888865-mellen,4,"I read this for a book club and loved it. This provides a solid not-too-technical review of everything happening in artificial intelligence. The thesis of the book is that true general artificial intelligence is a long way off. I mostly listened to the audio book, which I found very engaging. It was nice to have a hard copy to re-read and look at the pictures and diagrams."

About how society understood AI and what role does big tech companies had to play in it. Then this book tells you the limitations of AI and concept behind those limitations. Very lucidly written."
68,0374257833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47703382-arda,5,Thinking MachinesThe subject is very popular but at the same time open to fantasize . It might easily slip into fantasy and science fiction. The author who is an honest scientist discuss AI in a reasonable way. I appreciate what she did. Good job.
69,0374257833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1327459-choux,5,"This book may at first appear simplistic if you work within AI or understand some of the algorithms. If you want to understand basic logic and history behind the current dominant algorithms, this book will clarify these. Still, my biggest appreciation here goes to the author's argument simply presented throughout the book and beautifully summarised in the last several chapters. The book explains AI and situates it in its historical progression, systematically pinpointing the limitations or over-exaggerations at each new turn of history. It is a book written by an experienced computer scientist and hence the details are not burdensome but technical enough to grasp the underlying logic. But the author also is a researcher who grapples with the construct of intelligence. Hence, the thinking about this complex construct is really distilled to its essence in the concluding chapters, where the author presents some of her views on the fundamentals of human intelligence. The juxtaposition of these fundamentals with the capabilities of the machines presented throughout the book is obvious and compelling. I did not find the materials new per se, but the argument, examples, and some of the author's propositions would definitely form part of my own reasoning about humans and machines."
