0,0553101501,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7213075-ted,3,"This book is still in print!To me, that's pretty amazing. It seems that many readers would rather look at someone's views about our ""now"" or ""near now, plus or minus"", written four decades ago, than opening their eyes and looking for themselves.If I still had the book, I might be tempted to see what these old views of our ""now"" could have been that seem so ... prescient? But I don't have it, got rid of it to make shelf space. I admit that I only think I ever read the book. Someone below left an outraged comment about that - as if, had I rated the book a 5 instead of a 3, and written an effusive review, it would have made earth-shaking difference. Not my ratings/reviews! Oh well.At any rate, the cover of my edition said something about ""run-away best seller"". And it was, iirc.It's funny how books about the future are always so popular, even though everyone knows, if they think about it, that no one, including authors of said books, has a crystal ball. And without that little appliance it's pretty hard to see into the future with much accuracy.I suspect that if one could comb through all the ""future-looking"" books written in past decades, it might be found that the very few which exhibited pretty remarkable prescience would have been books that, when they were published, created either hardly a ripple, or else a backlash (see below **).Mostly we like visions of the future which are quite like our own wishes for both our own, and society's, future. But human wishes have a rather poor record of being fulfilled.I took a quick look through the book before giving it away (to BetterWorldBooks). Toffler talks about such things as people traveling more (sure he was right about that), economists being the same as always (another bingo), technology having either unforeseen consequences (right again) or very specific predicted consequences (not so good, those predictions) - lots of things like that.Missing are things about the triumph of Mega-capitalism, the existential threat of global warming, a world whose ecosystems are on the point of collapse, a population which is overwhelming the capacity of the earth to support it - little things like that.** Actually a lot of those were pretty much nailed by The Limits to Growth. But while that book did create a small stir when it was published just a couple years after Toffler's, it was mostly a lot of scoffing.So goes the future prediction industry. Not one to invest in, as far as I'm concerned. After all, we seem to have enough trouble deciding what happened in the past."
1,0553101501,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1006205-jeffrey,4,"This book was written 37 years ago, and Toffler's predictions have to a great degree come true. If you've never read Toffler, he's a must. A classic. Here Toffler speaks of a ""Future Shock"" in which people are not able to adjust to the quickening pace of society due to technological change. There are certain advantages to technology but are humans capable of keeping up emotionally, spiritually? He speaks of an increase in bizzar behavior (I remember reading about bizzar behavior in fiction that I thought I'd never see come to light, but to a great degree over time it has become more accepted and common), susceptibility to disease (an unexplained increase in cancer), and emotional breakdowns (which appear to be at epedemic proportions). This may be dated to some, but it's an essential read for those worried about their family and its future. If you want to read more about this then get The Third Wave and Tofflers most recent book, Revolutionary Wealth: How it will be created and how it will change our lives. "
2,0553101501,http://goodreads.com/user/show/695116-jim,5,"I read this years ago & liked it. It's worth reading again, almost 40 years after it was originally published. It's even more true. 'Future Shock' is based on the term 'Culture Shock' & Toffler's book deals with how the future is coming at us so fast that we're all in a state of shock from dealing with the changes. His writing is excellent, often illustrating large complex ideas with understandable examples, but he doesn't over-simplify nor repeat himself.He's written several other books, at least two to update this one. I haven't read them & I'm not sure I will. There's a good article on him & this book on Wikipedia.It's amazing how much this book still pertains today. It's heartening to see how many of the trends he wrote about have come true - it gave me confidence in his writing. It's a pity how some haven't come true - it defies logic & often points out areas where our society is too conservative. "
3,0553101501,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3748306-sean-meriwether,4,"I cannot believe how much Future Shock is a part of my background. While reading it I remembered direct quotes spoken by my mother and teachers; it was hugely popular in the 70’s. Toffler’s overall thesis is that although technology has helped humankind in gaining more choices and freedom, the acceleration of change is more than the human mind can tolerate. One of the more interesting elements of the theory is the direct correlation between dramatic change (moving, changing jobs, death of a spouse) and a negative impact on health. It is easy to pinpoint what he got wrong, like “parents” who raise children for professional couples who don’t have enough time, but he gets a lot more right. What he foresaw was a point in time where people could electronically collaborate across countries using computers, which is exactly what we do with the internet. If I had only read this 20 years ago and invested in AOL! The text is dated, speaking of women more frequently as housewives and secretaries, but the message still resonates 40 years later. We have distanced ourselves from each other because of technology, and we have had our “future shock” in regard to the unprecedented advance of technology, but overall the pluses have given us huge advances in collaboration, creative freedom, and entrepreneurship. Go into this knowing the original publication date and see a man who saw the future along before it happened."
4,0553101501,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1256262-ron,3,"Read decades ago. Wasn't impressed by Toffler high opinion of himself nor the uniqueness of his ""vision"" for the future. That said, his theme seemed to be right. In fact, as a certifiable Old Foogie, I am now experiencing the kind of ""shock"" he spoke of then: not just with the rapid rate of technological change but the revolution in morals and mores which is now happening.Of course, the other aspect of this is how shockingly stupid we are about history. Not just ancient history but recent American history. Almost daily the media and academics breathlessly announce some great revelation about what happened twenty to fifty years ago. I chuckle. To those of us alive (and paying attention) then, it's not news."
5,0553101501,http://goodreads.com/user/show/558206-eric,4,"The book is divided into 6 parts. Part 1 introduces the basic program (death of permanence), Parts 2-4 explain the 3 factors that induce future shock: transience, novelty and diversity and Parts 5-6 bring in future shock and possibly coping strategies. For me, it was initially a very slow read, but for some reason it eventually took off into Part 3, and I found myself sold.Toffler worries that we are hurtling towards mass feelings of ""future shock"" (akin to culture shock that travellers get when they go to a foreign country). The book serves as a tool for diagnosing the problem, i.e. why he thinks we'll be getting future shock, and also as a way of asking what we can do about it.He makes some predictions (especially in the novelty section), and almost 40 years later, we see that he gets some of the wrong, at least for the time being. But that doesn't matter. It's just details, and for that matter, he himself says that although it's very easy to get things wrong, it is important to try looking into and anticipating the future.Book is actually quite pro-technology and pro-change. Future shock comes because people today are experiencing too much change too fast. It's not that change is inherently bad, he says. Too little change and life is boring. But too much change, too much stimulation and we have trouble coping. And if you're worried about change, well there's a whole lot more of it coming right around the corner. (Key anticipatory rebuttal: it's important to plan for the long term, but that doesn't mean that plans have to be rigid. You may very well have to revise your 20 year plans from one year to the next, or more, but it's ok. Plan fluidly, but plan ahead)Some of his proposals don't seem terribly realistic: the idea of post-technocratic planning sounds swell and all, but I don't see any nation, democratic or otherwise sitting itself down for 5 years (he's thinking War Games and future-jury duty), taking stock and asking where it wants to be. In any case, Toffler wants to get us thinking about how we can manage change and assure humanity a soft landing into the future.Nice read. Kinda funny to see links with No Logo and The Paradox of Choice and maybe even Getting Things Done."
6,0553101501,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5410611-noura-algwaiz,5,"Alvin Toffler has put a huge amount of work in this book. It is basically about change, and he analyzes it in almost every aspect. The book was written 40 years ago, discussing how change and technological developments are shaping the future and influencing our lives. Toffler received a lot of praise for his highly accurate predictions of the future. Indeed he does deserve the praise, however he deserves even more praise for his analysis of the subject. He revolves his discussion of change around three pillars: transience, novelty, and diversity. 1) Different aspects of life are becoming less permanent and more temporary (or transient), from the disposable products we use to the increased need for moving from city to city (for education or work), to changing the organizations where we work. This leads us to breaking up old relationships and creating new ones, moving from our old houses to new ones .. and so on. 2) Novelty increases unfamiliarity and hinders our ability to use past experience to judge the new situations we face. 3) The diversity of choice is expanding to the extent of overchoice. Toffler suggests that people follow certain lifestyles as a means to cope with the overchoice problem (I personally found this discussion very interesting and eye opening to people's behaviour ..) Toffler emphasizes the urge to think about the future and to think differently. People (governments, educationalists, businesses, societies, parents ..) tend to face new problems with old mentalities. Toffler argues that bureaucracy is slowly being replaced with ad-hocracy, standardization with customization, the individual is loosing his attachment to his organization (work place) and replacing it with an attachment to his profession. And, in my opinion, the most critical discussion is how people's values change as they cope with change. Toffler concludes the book with strategies for survival. He emphasized, among other things, the importance of tentative goals as well as the importance of feedback in a constantly changing world.I dont claim to have covered the main points of the book. The book is crowded with concepts and arguments which have been approached from different angles. It is a mind stretcher and a thought provoker. A huge effort has been put into it, and the fact that it was written 40 years ago multiplies the amount of praise it deserves. "
7,0553101501,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3013648-priya,1,"The synopsis of this book is quite enticing to the curious reader who hopes to be enlightened by some radical thoughts, perhaps about mankind's future and how he can be better prepared for it. And hence, I picked this book. But then, all I got to read was 400 odd pages of rant about how bad it is for mankind to be subject to the cruelty of changing times. The atrocities inflicted by industrialization, technological revolution, shortening time and spaces, greater mobility of humans enabled by better transport, the demands of modern relationships and the lack of time thereof. Oh wait, this was just the tip of the iceberg. What about the barbarity of changing one's job every few years, and as a result changing one's social circle, kid's schools as well? Moreover, the lack of loyalty to one's organization is simply detrimental to humankind. What about the absolute irritation of having to 'use and throw' most of our products once they outlive their usefulness. And ugh, the plethora of choices we have in our lives. Decisions, decisions, decisions, how do we even make them? How unbearably difficult life is becoming for human beings to maintain their sanity on this earth, and coping with all these 'changes' in their lifestyles.Have I ranted enough? Now, read the above repeatedly for over 400 odd pages. And Wham! you get ""Future Shock"".A lot of reviewers praise this book saying - this book is as relevant today as it was 40 years ago when it was written. Isn't this counter-intuitive? The author said 40 years ago that humans will have immense trouble to cope with all those things that I mentioned above. If this is still relevant, how have we lived in the last 40 years then? We will continue to live in the same manner, so that 40 years into the future, someone will come and say say ""This book written 80 years ago is still as relevant""! To be very honest, I couldn't really read through this book, After the first few chapters, I just skimmed through the pages looking for anything interesting, but found none. "
8,0553101501,http://goodreads.com/user/show/583049-jason-degroot,4,"Fascinating book! I won't pretend that I'm smart enough to wrap my head around even half the concepts that Toffler brings up, but those that I did understand were pretty mind-blowing. It starts out and ends up a bit dry, but the ideas put forth in this are amazing, and 30 years out it's interesting to see which of his ""predictions"" have come true, which haven't, and which should have. As someone who's dealt with anxiety and panic attacks most of his life, I also found the discussion of the physiological effects of ""future shock"" really intriguing, as was the concept that man has a limited tolerance for change. Overall, Toffler has an amazing ability to analyze the societal shifts that were and are occurring in regards to materialism, politics, and even down to relationships. A bit heavy in terms of content, but well worth it."
9,0553101501,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8722850-tim,2,"Full of insightful ideas, many of which are just as relevant now in 2012 as they were when the book was written in the 70’s – some perhaps more so. The main barrier to my enjoyment of the book is that a lot of effort is spent easing the reader into each set of ideas, and in some cases it felt huge chunks of a chapter were devoted to an idea which was concisely dealt with in a few paragraphs. The chapter on mobility, as well as the final chapter were particularly gruelling for me.Cut away the fluff but keep the ideas (even the ideas that haven’t panned out are fascinating to read – the hit rate is very impressive), and I think in a volume of maybe 100 pages you would have an exceptional read. As it is the book asks for quite a bit of effort, but there is reward to be had if you persevere."
10,0553101501,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3680560-brad-acker,5,"Alvin Toffler is by far the most prescient author i have read; his bold predictions in this book, written 4 decades ago, are largely manifesting themselves today"
11,0553101501,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11179307-joan,1,"I've read the first 40 pages, then quit.The ideas in those 40 pages could have been expressed in three paragraphs --if they were worth being expressed.Toffler describes the properties and consequences of the worst illness of our time: the future shock. In our time, live changes so fast that we no longer know how to act; to quote the author:We no longer ""feel"" life as men did in the past. And this is the ultimate difference, the distinction that separates the truly contemporary man from all other.and againWe have cut ourselves off from the old ways of thinking, of feeling, of adaptingThe truth is, now in 2013, 40 years after the book, that humans are the same as always. Their problems, their preoccupations, their feelings are the same as Plato had, as Seneca had. Technology, its fast change, doesn't change the way we are; changes our lives, but not our essence.The author described technology, 40 years ago, as our saviour. The truth is that technology doesn't serve humans any more, technology doesn't worry about making our lives better, we live now to buy technology, to buy phones and tables and computers. We work to have technology, we sell our time to buy it, when technology should be working for us to give us free time.The author's abuse of the argument from authority doesn't make the points strong, and some times it is just a plain unqualified authority fallacy. That when he isn't using other fallacies, like slippery slope, begging the question or false cause. He states at the beginning that his theory doesn't have to be right but useful. I don't know if it is any. "
12,0553101501,http://goodreads.com/user/show/106016-anne,2,"The author is a little long-winded, but this book is unintentionally hilarious at times. It was social commentary written in 1970 about how quickly society and people's lives are changing. He makes some interesting points about how temporary our relationships are becoming and how technology is facing us with an overwhelming amount of options. But my favorite parts are when he starts making predictions about the future. By the year 2000, half the population will live in underwater communities! We'll be turning into cyborgs! Who wear clothes made out of paper! Good times."

To get a broad and deeper view about family, relationshipd, education, technology, politics, psychology, biology, inventions, life pattern..etc..etc...one must read this book and ofcourse to get a glimpse of future . One hell of a read about ""CHANGE"" . "
14,0553101501,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30932678-abhijeet-lele,5,One of the best book by one of the best author.
15,0553101501,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5870882-sunny,5,"One of the best books I’ve read recently. I remember reading this as a 18/19 year old but this made a lot more sense to me now. Its about the future and the change of pace we are experiencing. Like a faster delivery from a fast bowler if were not carefully were gonna get caught out. The book discusses so many different things but the essence of the book is around how we need to manage the change around is rather than letting it happen willy-nilly. If you’re read Musil’s “man without qualities” – a group of people who can come together from different parts of society to guide it is what the book implies is needed. No room for ludditism here at all but it does ask us to question our use of technology and our abandonment to it. (I’ve recently given up using my iphone on the week ends as a result of the arguments put here). There are 2 excellent chapters near the end on education and technology and for those 2 alone the book is worth reading. The book also covers time and change, knowledge as fuel, people of the future, the concept of transience, impermanence, rental revolution, fads, demise of geography, duration of human relationships, friendships in the future, the new ad-hocracy, the denial of change, mystique of motherhood, temporary marriage, demands of freedom, hippies, beatniks, power of style, free society and overstimulation. This was written in 1970. "
16,0553101501,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58752586-simeon-mihaylov,5,"First the good:- Very interesting book, which makes you think about a lot of things. It gives you insane amount of awakening about the future, although the book was written way back in the day.- A lot of the predictions were accurate enough- The Author has interesting style and I would even say unique. Sometimes it might be considered way too repetitive, but since his ideas are often uncommon, I would say that it might be necessary.The bad: Towards the end of the book he is way too utopic. As we might see today, we are far from his ideas about the right of all to decide our future. Sadly enough, we are still in the technocratic style of governments, schools, universities etc...Some final words:It was really hard to me to decide whether I should give 5 stars or 4, but I would put it this way...The book might have been way better if it was summed up in less pages. Reading 430 pages of constant repetitions isn't an easy task. Other than that - definitely good book and worth reading. "
17,0553101501,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3437934-courtney,1,"It took me three years to get around to finishing this book. It's a pretty painful read. Toffler has a bad habit of creating at least one neologism in each chapter. In my opinion, resorting to neologisms is just a failure to analyze your own arguments. Neologisms are a cheap way out.Also, Toffler fills each chapter with paragraph after paragraph of case study and academic quotation. Then at the end of the chapter he sums it up with some kind of statement to the effect of ""obviously this must be the case"". Upon this flimsy structure he tries to argue for the destruction and recreation of literally every social institution from families to religion, education, and government. All because ""change is accelerating""."
18,0553101501,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1190907-al-carlson,4,"This was the beginning of Toffler's trilogy that continued with The Third Wave and PowerShift. In each of them, he looked at the world and said, ""This is where we're going, and here's why."" He and his wife, Heidi, who co-wrote these, seemed to be able to see about a decade ahead of the rest of us.His analysis and predictions in the first two books--published in the 70's and 80's--seem mundane now. His third title in this group--published in 1990--still has some ideas that haven't manifested yet.I wish they're write another one, so I could know what will be going on in 2025."
19,0553101501,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41769808-margaret-lozano,4,"I read this book many decades after its first printing, so many of Toffler's predictions had fallen flat. But I was still inspired by the overall theme, and captivated by the idea of futurism more generally. For that reason, I'll always have a special appreciation for this book."
20,0553101501,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58798448-ramzauva-chhakchhuak,4,This book was first written in 197o and here I am in 2018 living through many of the things the author discusses in the book. Prophetic to say the least. 
21,0553101501,http://goodreads.com/user/show/95383877-t-s-esque,3,"Audiobook: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TP3Jf...""Future Shock is about the present.""PHEW! Okay. 600 pages of hypothetical science fiction musings on the future published in 1970 by two ""futurists"" (Alvin & Heidi Toffler). It is many things; in part, you guessed it, a little problematic if we are to isolate all the parts that suggest things that would never happen or cast fear over the still unknown. There is a pinch of phobia in their considerations towards the future of LGBTQ+ individuals, families and parents, for example. Their predictions on the possible future of education are, in part, very silly in hindsight; particularly the concept of training children to live in under-water submarines and within space travel programs. [I'm writing this in 2019, though, Sea Lab was set in 2020-2021, so there is theoretically still time for this prediction to come true.] I do, however find (with those & similar parts ignored) many valuable insights on the future concerning the actual structuring of teaching and communications methods. The concept of ""future shock"" itself is a statement that addresses a world of increasing individual anxieties, therefore the whole premise of the book can by no means simply be dismissed; just look around you, anxieties to cope with what feels like a perpetually fast-approaching change are not abnormal in the 21st century. The authors muse about the future of human interactions, particularly that we would demand more meaningful relationships for less personal investment; manifested now, in real life (IRL), by the proverbial Rolodex of social media & all that comes with it; truncated interactions & cycling through information, connections, & interpersonal relationships with people of varying degrees of familiarity. Even their criticism of the ways we literally structure classrooms in very similar ways; rows of desks [i.e 5x6 rows] or in very particular units (say interacting one-on-one or in groups of 4), etc., merits some potential exploratory discussion.The version I have was not revised. The last re-printing of this book was in 1999 & I think it suffers greatly for it. [I have not read the 1999 version but I would not hold my breath that it's the huge improvement that I think it could be.] This book could be incredible if it was re-contextualized and edited down / revised to suit what we have learned since then and juxtapose some of their predictions to the actual present, about 50 years after the original publication, now. That said, this book gives me the impression of a tome with a tumbleweed blowing past it. I don't think it's going to be given a second life at this point, which is just a little sad."

23,0553101501,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21430140-jerry,5,"	Students in Berlin and New York, in Turin and Tokyo, capture their deans and chancellors, bring great clanking education factories to a grinding halt, and even threaten to topple governments. Police stand aside in the ghettos of New York, Washington and Chicago as ancient property laws are openly violated. Sexual standards are overthrown. Great cities are paralyzed by strikes, power failures, riots.This is an amazing book; amazing both because of how clearly he showed the failure of bureaucracy as technological and social advancement speeds up, and amazing because of how he cannot see beyond more bureaucracy as the solution. This book reminds me a lot of David Goldhill’s Catastrophic Care. He clearly sees the problem, and then prescribes: more of the same, but harder.There is a tendency to assume that change is perennial, that generations have always seen completely different worlds than their parents, that the generation gap has been with us since we’ve been human. But from a technological standpoint, that isn’t true. As Norbert Wiener wrote in Cybernetics and Society:	One of Columbus’ sailors would have been a valuable able seaman aboard Farragut’s ships. Even a sailor from the ship that took Saint Paul to Malta would have been quite reasonably at home as a forecastle hand on one of Joseph Conrad’s barks. A Roman cattleman from the Dacian frontier would have made quite a competent vaquero to drive longhorn steers from the plains of Texas to the terminus of the railroad, although he would have been struck with astonishment with what he found when he got there.Toffler makes the point that if you look at generations, our current technological change has been breathtaking:	…if the last 50,000 years of man’s existence were divided into lifetimes of approximately 62 years each, there have been about 800 such lifetimes. Of these 800, fully 650 were spent in caves. Only during the last 70 lifetimes has it been possible to communicate effectively from one lifetime to another—as writing made it possible to do. Only during the last six lifetimes did masses of men ever see a printed word. Only during the last four has it been possible to measure time with any precision. Only in the last two has anyone anywhere used an electric motor. And the overwhelming majority of all the material goods we use in daily life today have been developed within the present, the 800th, lifetime.Of course, he wrote this in 1970, almost a lifetime ago. Since he wrote that, we’ve gotten personal computers, cell phones, and the Internet. Video arcades didn’t exist then; they rose and fell in the lifetime after he wrote this book. Watergate hadn’t happened yet. The word once, in a footnote halfway through the book, referring only to one of the buildings in the Watergate complex.But he manages to avoid the problem that so many hard science fiction writers face, that if you only write about things that are possible, you miss the solutions you can’t see. When he talks about the burgeoning diversification of choice when listening to the radio, he projects a future that is almost literally impossible with the technology of radio. He simply assumes that some technology will fill the human need for more diverse music and talk. He doesn’t even talk about how it will get there, although he clearly does see the potential in computer networks, that they allow us to “assemble situational groups swiftly” and abandon them as quickly.He foresees the limited swing back to educational pluralism, especially home education, at a time when this could literally land you in jail.He coins lots of terms, most of which were not adopted; some of which should have been. Celebrity image bombs, for example.	In a society in which instant food, instant education, and even instant cities are everyday phenomena, no product is more swiftly fabricated or more ruthlessly destroyed than the instant celebrity. Nations advancing towards super-industrialism sharply step up their output of these “psycho-economic” products. Instant celebrities burst upon the consciousness of millions like an image bomb—which is exactly what they are.And, critically, he recognizes what few recognized at the time: that the rise of computers and automation threatened not to crush us under a giant bureaucracy but rather to overthrow bureaucratic authority.	…bureaucracies are well suited to tasks that require masses of moderately educated men to perform routine operations, and, no doubt, some such operations will continue to be performed by men in the future. Yet it is precisely such tasks that the computer and automated equipment do far better than men. It is clear that in super-industrial society many such tasks will be performed by great self-regulating systems of machines, doing away with the need for bureaucratic organization. Far from fastening the grip of bureaucracy on civilization more tightly than before, automation leads to its overthrow.What he does miss, however, is significant. He recognized, for example, the psychologization of the economy, that people would buy not just clothing and food for its psychological value, but that “Great, globe-girdling syndicates will create super-Disneylands of a variety, scale, scope, and emotional power that is hard for us to imagine.”He extrapolated this partly from the psychic loading that airlines used to do to entice business travelers to use their service over their competitors. He makes the mistake many science fiction authors do, as Harlan D. Mills noted in the foreword to BASIC with Style, that “in 1900 it was possible to foresee cars going 70 miles an hour, but the drivers were imagined as daredevils rather than grandmothers.”He imagines sexoticism and super-Disneylands, but what we got was affordable air travel. For much of the super-industrial world, the world itself is our super-Disneyland. It isn’t limited to businessmen and jet-setters today.What he missed was that the reason the airlines appealed in the way that they did is that they were a heavily regulated industry that didn’t have much leeway outside of the bounds of the government bureaucracies that controlled them. He knew that those bureaucracies were dying; he didn’t put together that this meant that airlines would be able to compete on getting from point a to point b—their core function—at lower prices, rather than on the extras that don’t get us where we want to go. Every once in a while someone nostalgic for the stewardesses and food of the old days tries to start up an old-style airline. And it fails, because what people want is to get where they’re going with money left over to enjoy it.The problem is that too much is changing too fast and all of us are running the risk of a PTSD-like ailment he calls future shock. It is the thesis of this book that there are discoverable limits to the amount of change that the human organism can absorb, and that by endlessly accelerating change without first determining these limits, we may submit masses of men to demands they simply cannot tolerate. We run the high risk of throwing them into that peculiar state that I have called future shock.￼￼￼￼Different people react to future shock in different ways. Its symptoms also vary according to the stage and intensity of the disease. These symptoms range all the way from anxiety, hostility to helpful authority, and seemingly senseless violence, to physical illness, depression and apathy. Its victims often manifest erratic swings in interest and life-style, followed by an effort to “crawl into their shells“ through social, intellectual and emotional withdrawal. They feel constantly “bugged“ or harassed, and want desperately to reduce the number of decisions they must make.￼￼The solution? First, we need large bureaucracies to decide now what skills will likely be needed fifty years from now. And because large bureaucracies tend to produce monocultures, we need to have lots of them, and they need to pay people to live in experimental communities. In other words, we need to maintain the factory mindset that he decries throughout the entire first three quarters of the book, with authority setting the factory in motion.Second, we need a large bureaucracy to decide what scientific and technological breakthroughs are allowed. It would be immoral to end technological and scientific progress. But in the face of a crisis this big, a little immorality is justified.When he talks about government funding, he almost hits the issue: government research funding overwhelms all other funding and is directed by bureaucrats rather than by what most people want their future to be. This is what results in self-driving cars that can’t tell humans from non-humans. High resolution television sets that can’t handle a car driving past your house. Dishwashers that take hours to complete their cycles.But stuck as he is in the factory mindset, his only solution to government bureaucrats is more government bureaucrats. He fears a “techno-managerial elite”, and so wants to set up bureaucracies whose purpose is managing technological advance. Someone has to block the future equivalent of the car and the transistor and clean clothes.	…we must also design creative new political institutions… for promoting or discouraging (perhaps even banning) certain proposed technologies. We may wish to debate its form; its need is beyond dispute.He becomes just one more seventies crisifier, falsely yelling that if we don’t turn over our freedom now, we will all go into a coma and die. It goes against almost everything he wrote in the first part of the book.His technology blockers must ask “how will a proposed new technology affect the value system of the society?” But he does not ask “how will such a dictatorial system affect our value system?” He sidesteps this question in a passing reference, but never addresses it head-on, and it’s the most important question that should be asked of such a solution. He becomes a parody of Chesterton’s dictum in Heretics that 	the weakness of all Utopias is this, that they take the greatest difficulty of man and assume it to be overcome, and then give an elaborate account of the overcoming of the smaller ones.He denigrates letting people buy what they want to buy as the means of choosing which technologies succeed; he calls this econocentric, but doesn’t seem to understand what this means. When companies adjust their products to meet the demands of potential customers, such as when mutual funds invest only in certain sectors, he calls these “non-economic considerations”. He seems confused by the “increasing intimacy of the links between the economic sector and powerful cultural, psychological and social forces”. By the latter, he means “customers”.I was reminded of the excitement over the Segway several years ago. The “public agencies and corporations” thought it would revolutionize cities and change their very design. The people who would have to use them disagreed. Imagine if his proposed government-corporate partnership had decided to promote the Segway with legal force, or had wasted time discouraging a product that wasn’t going to take over anyway.He assumes as a given that government planners are econocentric, oriented only to improving the economy, then makes the obvious observation that this is a failed model—without considering that perhaps his assumptions are wrong, even though he recognizes that government social programs tend to bring the opposite of what they were supposed to do.He seems to mistake a disenchantment with technocratic planners for a disenchantment with science.His giant bureaucracies would not operate entirely above the masses. He would implement vast games—literally, games, vaguely similar to the role-playing games—to draw the public, currently “political eunuchs”, into “a continuing plebiscite on the future”—in an advisory capacity. Artists might be shown the technologies of the future to advise the bureaucrats on what should be available to them.But even if the politicians and bureaucrats were to listen to this advice, the people who say that they want better-looking stewardesses but only pay for getting from point a to point b are not going to provide the advice that gives us better air travel.This is a big book with big ideas that transforms itself into a small book with small ideas, and would transform the world in the same way."

It was published in 1970. Sure, it's a bit dated, but it has some fun aspects. The beginning and middle of the book are interesting from an anthropological standpoint - watching what the author got right about society today and what he got horribly wrong. More personally relevant to me, though, was the end of the book, when Toffler gets on his high horse and starts making moral proclamations. While Toffler does a lot of ""This is obviously wrong and I'm not going to dignify the reasons why it's wrong with page time,"" but he also does a fair amount of questioning basic societal assumptions."" "" think he simplifies the pre-tech way of life: ""Only romantic fools babble about returning to a 'state of nature.' A state of nature is one in which infants shrivel and die for lack of elementary medical care, in which malnutrition stultifies the brain, in which, as Hobbes reminded us, the typical life is 'poor, nasty, brutish, and short.' To turn our back on technology would be not only stupid but immoral'"" (370). But he does caution a sort of noblesse oblige - be responsible with what we do.... ""At the same time, it is undeniably true that we frequently apply new technology stupidly and selfishly. In our haste to milk technology for immediate economic advantage, we have turned our environment into a physical and social tinderbox..."" which ""is matched by the industrial vomit that fills our skies and seas. Pesticides and herbicides filter into our foods. Twisted automobile carcasses, aluminum cans, non-returnable glass mottles and synthetic plastics form immense kitchen middens in our midst as more and more of our detritus resists decay.... We risk thermopollution of the oceans themselves, overheating them, destroying immeasurable quantities of marine life, perhaps even melting the polar icecaps"" (380). [Fix education from past-worship to planning for the future.] Toffler champions something akin to speculative fiction - theorizing about what could happen in the future - imaginitively as well as systematically - to help us figure out how to cope with what is to come. The world really is changing faster and faster all the time. While I'm still (okay, for the last two+ years) the kind of girl who likes to live in the moment, I try not to do so recklessly. So many companies look only to the bottom line in the next year or five and refuse to see the externalities and hidden costs. A new factory may cause an economic boom in the short run but in the long run it may kill jobs, ruin the economic livelihoods of townspeople, and belch poison into the environment.[Politics] ""The two parties, despite huge differences in social issues and civil liberties, are really not so different when it comes to money and values. The economy is its own god, and GDP is all that matters. ""So long as an industrializing nation is poor, it tends to welcome without argument any technical innovation that promises to improve economic output or material welfare. This is, in fact, a tacit technological policy, and it can make for extremely rapid economic growth"" (383). Good in the short run, potentially devastating in the long run.On the one hand, Toffler advocates for being more careful with how we apply technology. Yay for science - don't stop learning - but be more thoughtful in how you apply what you learn. Don't be so myopic (406). You can't count on Jesus coming tomorrow and saving you from yourself. Respect the earth and its inhabitants while you're here.Toffler also advocates for democracy. Elitism - rule by those who know best over those who don't care - does seem attractive.... The best way to deal with angry or recalcitrant minorities is to open the system further, bringing them in as full partners, permitting them to participate in social goal-setting, rather than attempting to ostracize or isolate them"" (422). Give people a part in something positive to work toward instead of only telling them what's wrong. Identifying problems is, indeed, important, but we remain impotent until we figure out what to *do* about it. What to do instead of the broken way things are. Toffler asks a great question: ""What kind of a world do you want ten, twenty, or thirty years from now?"" What *are* we living for? What do we want for ourselves, our neighbors, our children? Kumbaya, but we do have to work together to see and effect a better tomorrow. Toffler ends his book with a call to action. Work together, make it better. Groovy."

26,0553101501,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1184269-joe,3,"This book proposes a warning of impending social decay caused by a condition the author calls ""Future Shock"". In the first 2/3rds of the book, he spends a great deal of time explaining the elements contributing to Future Shock, namely ""transience"" and the ""accelerative thrust"". Toffler's explanations are very detailed; he starts with how these ideas apply to ourselves, psychologically, to the economy, to society at large, etc. Indeed, it seems very hard to contest his view of the world, though it is extremely dark and evokes restlessness. Fortunately, Toffler ends up explaining how to cope with Future Shock in the end. Yay!I truly thought Toffler's vision of the future - of today - was surprisingly accurate. Until the second half, I actually considered it revolutionary considering no-one to my knowledge had proposed such a well developed explanation about how and why the future would turn out the way it did. Unfortunately, I arrived at the final section of the book realizing that Toffler's ideas aren't revolutionary at all, and have been written in countless psychological works under the topic of general stress.Future Shock is an extremely well written piece by Alvin Toffler, and offers a thorough prediction of what life will be like in ""the future"", and offers suggestions for how to cope with problems that we may encounter. I ended up giving this three stars because while it was a great read that held my interest, it did not live up my expectations, namely that it would lead to blindsiding revelation about the world. "
27,0553101501,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75251-jeffrey,4,"Accurate picture of cultural forces clashing in the 21st century where the information age brings about changes that those who are for accelerating into the technological era embrace while those who yearn for old days where things were seen as rosy, they reject the movement of this new era.But colorful lenses deceive as the old farm days were filled with sickness without good medical care, harsh environmental forces coming into play and people being left to the mercy of storm, rain and drought. Children were raised as cattles since the goal of kids were simply for survival and cheap labor was always good as teenagers consumned little and could easily work much without all the hassle of union rights and demands. White coat Gods are disassembled and seen as mere mortals who cannot solve a wide variety of diseases with consumers bringing in law suits from varios angles. Their high power prestige struck mercilessly from the business arena with HMO providers etc, and the playing field gets leveled through ""efficiency""Politicians, lawyers, psycholigist as well as spiritual masters coming in to say their two cents worth, yet no one is quite in agreement with each other - having learned from experiences that form, shape thoughts and essentially mould their very essence.

28,0553101501,http://goodreads.com/user/show/838694-frederick,2,"This book does offer some insights into the nature of change and the possible effects and outcomes, it suffers from a lack of data and breath of understand. This creates large assumptions from not enough sources leading to incorrect assessments. The authors breathy pronouncements, fail to realize a fundamental truth. The future will probably be about like the present but a little different. The author sees technological change creating rapped social change and more dynamism. He overstates this point. Friendships and social networks take time to build up, even if everyone is instantly connected. The same goes for business networks, and they are built on trust and experience. This slows things down. As much as we would like to believe we can create things over night (and in many cases we can) when it’s a risk we rely on trust and experience. It’s a way of mitigating uncertainty. We do not know what the future holds but we know the people we are dealing with and have faith that it will work out. The predictive power of the book hits a correct note (depending on the industry) when it comes to the changing nature of work, and the enhancement of the value of talent and creativity allowed in the work place. It fails when the book speaks of social and environmental aspects. "

30,0553101501,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2970024-john-frederick,4,"It's always fun to go back to the future, and futurist, Alvin Toffler, has offered suggestion and insights that are dead on, or still of concern in forty years from when the book was originally published. It's amazing how a lot of the concerns and ideas are still relevant today. This is a quick read, however, I have too much read, so have been taking my time. Heavily influenced by Buckminster Fuller, and Toffler does seem to repeat himself often with out saying much in certain subparts of his chapters, but when he comes up with an idea, it strikes. What is wonderful is paging through his bibliography and finding other similar authors and theorists of the era (mid to late 60s) to read or add to the book shelf"
31,0553101501,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17486478-aziff,4,"It has been almost forty years since it was first published and A. Toffler's fine work continues to amaze and surprise me with its accurate predictions. Future Shock, ahead of its time, explores the human socio-economic and psychological understanding and applies it to maximum effect. That at this point, upon reading sentence upon logical sentence, everything could only be nodded and agreed at. Perhaps not all arguments flexed in this book may be fully accurate, but for a book published way back then when these concepts were close to foreign - It makes reading it a delight and would definitely send shivers down your spine."
32,0553101501,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7070820-ania,4,"A really interesting book written in the 1960s and published in 1970. I can't help but feel that the moon landing of 1969 somehow inspired this book.I really enjoyed this work, even if it was a bit depressing. In a nutshell what this book says is that we can expect from the future a more modular, segmented life, this includes personal lives as well. I've only taken off one star because I feel some of the adaptation strategies towards the future may be kind of lacking, but for a tough book judge like myself 4 stars is a very high rating, therefore I recommend this book if you're on the fence about reading it."

Though it lacks suspense, romance, and those other aspects we are so fond of it fiction work this book takes up the slack with its insightful facts of cultural change. This book, as well as the title, which became a household phrase, is more profound now than in the late sixties. I must read for every human being especially those that pride themselves on there social progressive views toward the advancement of human kind and the planet we inhabit. "

Maybe a revised more contemporary version would be great. Alvin Toffler was certainly unique in his time and visionary. I might reread it or listen to audio version of the book itself. I borrowed this book from a university library upon a recommendation of a previous colleague of mine. I know that English is a second language for me but I reckon the language of the book would feel the same to a millenial natove English speaker."
35,0553101501,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2280809-wilte,3,"Future shock is the stress and disorientation caused by too much change in too short a time. Written 45 years ago, this concept is still very relevant, maye be even more relevant than in 1970. Book contains interesting concepts and is only occasionaly far of the mark with futuristic predictions.I also liked the concept of adhocracy that will replace bureaucracy; increases adaptability of organizations (I suppose current term would be 'agile') but strains adaptibility of men."

Never fell off into praising the second coming in the form of a technilogical singularity"
38,0553101501,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34766635-rogerio,5,This book is fantastic. It is hard to believe that Alvin Toffler wrote it in 1970.

42,0553101501,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13459886-yhc,2,"In my previous book Present Shock: When Everything Happens Now that i enjoyed a lot, it mentioned about this very famous book, future shock and i have it with me for long but never got the chance to read it(also all his other books that i will surely read over ). This book was published in 1970, almost 5 decades ago, therefore i read it as a sci-fi futurist book with the touch of Utopian style. Considering it has been almost 50 years old, Toffler got pretty precise prediction on most of the things he predicted in the book, but what i want to mentioned here is the one he failed to predicted and the reality was rather disappointing. Most of his predictions are around society, education, population change, science development, human relationship, companies...etc.1. He didn't mention anything about globalization, I think at that time this is still pretty new. We feel the commerce is going to develop over continents but globally in the way we are today is indeed fast.2. He didn't mention about banking system would actually became such fatal role to control this planet, the repeated financial crisis doesn't teach us to learn lessons.3. The political development was rarely mentioned, he mentioned about socialist democracy but not capitalized communism...who would know that the biggest politically communism, China, embrace capitalism economically so well now.4. During the cold war, Soviet and USA had space race so we sent people to space and to the moon. In this book, Toffler mentioned many times about space development would reach certain level that we will have so ""many"" astronomers actually live in ISS. (heartache!) Who would know that 50 years later, our astronomers only stay on earth orbit, and never set their foot back to the moon. Luckily we have a big dreams soon with SpaceX to go beyond the moon. Let's pack soon to Mars. Am I allowed to dream big before i get old?5. In Toffler's farest dream, he would never know that one day, the war between 2 countries could be like Virtual Reality games. One side with real casualties, the other would remotely control the drone through screen in another side of the earth, after the mission is done, this few people military still can go back home having dinner with their family. (mentioned in my last book Present Shock: When Everything Happens Now ) 6. Far from training dolphins to be our deep sea exploring partners, we exploit their home, pollute their space into continental size of plastic island. Well done Humans! And of course, we hunt dolphins ,whales, and many other kinds of sea animals with big corporation ship that spare-nothing-kind-of-fishing Nets. (wonder why they don't use their super Nets to clean up the plastic island shit instead)7. Genetically modified on Wild animals to be more docile? Why? Toffler? I thought most of them are killed by humans, docile or not, we just invade their home for the sake of humans!8. 24 hours day light thanks to big mirror reflect from space with satellites to light up the dark side of earth. Toffler mentioned about day light needed in winter time of Scandinavia, which is understandable. for plants to grow, yes. But if for the sake of industry 24 hours function, so human also taking shift to keep working. No way.....give this poor ear a break! we have enough stuff that we don't really need but fabricated. I think this book still have many things for us to actually take into consideration, but like i say, the power is in the hands of big corporations, they don't care about what skin colors we are, what political situation you believe, they just want money!! and Money craving is good enough to destroy this world, and that is the biggest shock!"
43,0553101501,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63892286-sheryl-mccoy,5,"It's difficult to rate ""Future Shock"" highly when reading it is like watching the destruction of civilization in slow motion. Yet, the book is a great read...if you think it's science fiction. These events laid out in this book were not BOUND TO HAPPEN, they were FORCED TO HAPPEN, much like the Shadow Wars in Babylon 5. It wasn't destiny, so much as brain-washing, that makes this future a real possibility.""Future Shock"" is one of the first books to lay out how the unscrupulous would use what we now call ""persuasive technology"" to ensure the rise of a corporate feudal system. from the golden age of corporate capitalism where criminal elements within the Nixon government and corporations began to be recognized as NORMAL. If you didn't realize this, you better go back and read ""Future Shock"" and the companion books again. Most people read Toffler's books and see themselves as the ONE who will rise above the dross. Don't be fooled. This book, Future Shock, is one of a set of cookbooks, including ""The Third Wave"", ""Power Shift"" and others that have been used to ""cook up"" a dismal future for most humans. If you aren't IN THE GROUP MAKING THIS HAPPEN, you aren't in...you are among the dross.At one time, I thought Toffler would find people to put on the brakes to this change in worldview, but that never happened. Let me remind you that NONE OF US who use and rely on public online spaces will be in the upper or even midling echelons of future/present/past feudal leaders. Some politicians like Newt Gingrich and others helped Toffler create this new world through the various laws and groups who control the ""confused"" majority. It's highly unlikely that those of us who saw it all along will make much of a dent in stopping it. When I read Future Shock, I was also reading a great many other books which aligned with the future or aligned with this book in science fiction. It took me a decade before I figured out that this man was laying out A REAL PLAN to put most of us (the 99%) into a state of modern servitude where governments and constitutions of the 2oth century have fallen. The independent person had fallen. There is no fiction here. Think of this plan as an explanation of how Huxley's ""Brave New World"" could come into existence.It seems to me that Toffler's writing style was very engaging, yet alarming in the way he spoke of a return to a recognizable feudal state. A CORPORATE feudal state was described and honored by Toffler. I remember wondering if this could be resisted. I learned that it could not. From the late 1980's until Toffler's death, I watched as he wrote less for a public audience and more for a nouveau feudal ruling class. He and his wife gave conferences and developed relationships with ""leaders"" to maximize ways to create the new corporate feudal system. It seemed to me that he and his wife were glad to be plugged into the process of turning the majority of humans into corporate serfs. I remember one part of his first book included warnings that you would not be able to resist. If you did resist, you would be completely locked out of the corporate-based feudal world. This meant that personal ownership outside the corporate feudal systems would eventually disappear, unless you had some value to the overlords. Take these books for what you will. If you're confused, don't worry...you are just where Toffler and his minions knew you would be."
44,0553101501,http://goodreads.com/user/show/98347967-john,5,"2020 marks 50 years since Future Shock was first published. As a book about the future and how to adapt to its inevitable change it was an interesting time to read it. Due to the fact that I am 50 years removed from the world in which it was written in I am given a very different mindset to read it in. My enjoyment of the book comes partially from looking back with 2020 hindsight and partially from finding its original message still relevant today. The introductory chapters of this book explain just how fast our society started moving in the 20th century. Compared to today this rate of advancement has only increased in acceleration. 1970 marks one of the earliest generations to notice how fast information moves and how quick things can change. I can only imagine how intense this period must have been as no other period of human history progress at the pace of the first 70 years of the 20th century, at that point.A lot of the first half of the book discusses many of the trends of 1970. Toffler projects how changes that happened in the prior half of the 20th century will affect the years after. It was great to see what was seen as revolutionary or points of interest to a person of this time. As someone who finds the 20th century to be one of the most interesting points of history to study, a lot of this book was a pleasure to read. There is a wide variety of subjects covered in this book. Because of this some chapters might interest certain readers more than others. By covering all of these trends the book can feel like it is part history, sociology, philosophy, anthropology, futurist, and business. As a business school graduate some of the chapters on consumer trends were great insight into marketing knowledge of the day, even if some of the information is rudimentary today.Toffler makes many speculations about the future and surprisingly a lot of them turn out to have become true. Granted there are a few subjects he misses on but they are still fun to read about, they just feel more sci-fi than realistic.The overall message of Future Shock is to address the trend of rapid change that forces human beings obsolete if they don't know how to adapt with the changes and learn current information. He offers so many great insights and the fact that they are still relevant really shows how this book is still useful to read today. That being said, reading this 50 years on and realizing not that much has changed is a depressing thought. If more people had read this book back then and incorporated its message into their lives maybe we'd have solve more of societies issues. Its also ironic that many of the people who would have been youth at the point of publishing this book are now the elder, ruling class, failing to adapt to our current world, holding us back. Maybe this is just part of the human condition and it is inevitable that we will fail future generations.Overall I would recommend anyone looking for insight into life during 1970 as well as a better way of looking at the future to read this book. It is well worth it."
45,0553101501,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20926327-lora-shouse,4,"When I was in college Future Shock was all over the shelves at the bookstore and everywhere. Obviously, I should have read it then. A least I could have added it to my book list; I hadn’t closed the first list at that time. But honestly, I don’t know when I would have had the time to read it. And anyway, there were other things I was more interested in at the time.When I was putting books on my second list years later, it occurred to me that I hadn’t ever read Future Shock, and, somewhat surprised that it was still around, I added it to the list at that time. So, now I have finally read it.The first three-quarters of the book or so are pretty fun. Toffler surveys some of the rapidly multiplying different ways of living that were coming into being or looked about to be coming into being and looks at the consequences of too much (or too little) change at one time. At close to fifty years later, I can say that much of what he predicted has in fact happened. I can’t vouch for every little thing he talked about, but he was right on the money about a lot of things like corporate mindset and changes in work – I have lived through a lot of exactly what he was talking about.I’m not sure the pace of change ever got to quite what he expected it to. It was, and still is, plenty fast, mind you, and for those people living on the cutting edge of change all the time I’m sure plenty have and still do experience the negative effects he pointed out. Maybe the increase in the rate of change finally got to a point where it could not keep continuing. Maybe factors such as the environmental movement began to act as kind of a drag on the pace of some kinds of changes. Maybe a large proportion of the population was just not able to change that fast. Anyway, I don’t think that the rate of change ever got quite as out-of-hand as he thought it might. At least not yet.The last quarter of the book, where he talks about what we can do to buffer ourselves against the worst of future shock is a little more boring. A lot of this is suggestions for suggestions. Some of it has been tried, at least on a limited basis. Occasionally cities will get together a planning group to try to plan out some aspects of their future – like what to do about transportation or jobs or living space. But I don’t think this has ever been done very extensively on a national or global level, or very often even on a more local level. And I’m not sure anybody knows how to educate children for a future that we don’t even know what it is yet.This was a library book."

Alvin Toffler noticed the signs. He wrote about the signs and elaborated upon them in this book, Future Shock. 'Future shock' was the term he coined for the disease that would afflict unprepared individuals in the future. If I can describe the book in one word, it would be comprehensive. His treatise is full of corroborative references: in fact, 80 pages of the book are all his references. Notable among his points is that more knowledge has been accrued in the past fifty years than in the time between the 15th and 19th century. Among the important points in his treatise is the idea of transience pervading over our everyday lives. Everything is transient - not only things and places, but more importantly, even knowledge and people.In addition, the future also brings with it much novelty and an infinity of choices. Through numerous examples, Toffler claims that it is the lack of rootedness and the difficulty of choice that drives a lot of people towards a breakdown. Given what I perceive nowadays, it's impressive that Toffler was generally right. He had accurately predicted the irascibility of humans at this day and age: millennials nowadays have girlfriends or boyfriends as young as the age of ten; teenage pregnancies are becoming more and more common, and the lack of stability and rootedness within the family and society has fragmented less robust families. One shortcoming from Toffler's book was his inability to predict the repercussions of the personal computer. Because he was unable to predict the advent of the PC through the efforts of pioneers like Wozniak, Gates, and Jobs, he, in effect was conservative in his estimates. The personal computer drastically optimized the speed of new technologies entering our society and culture. The increased speed in computation transformed society, both positively and negatively: while we have information and knowledge at our fingertips, with ease of access, we also have developmentally delayed four-year old children whose tablets have become substitutes for creativity. Well, I guess Toffler was right all along: future shock has arrived. "
47,0553101501,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4872710-eric-swanson,3,"Was a crystal ball for society and technology.Alvin's insights in this book included many accurate predictions for how society would engage and embrace technology in the past future. The book is an easy read with points that continue to have some resonance.Have you ever felt that change was coming too fast and frequently? This is a core tenant of Future Shock, written in a time when computer technology was new, adapting, and accelerating; where technology innovation continues presently. Alvin suggests that society and individuals must be willing to adapt as crucial criteria for success. He highlights that organizations and the world itself will adopt more fluid, shifting structures and interactions based on enabling technology. The internet as well as personal devices today are perfect examples for the fluid nature of how our social, professional and personal interactions with technology are tightly intertwined. However, he warns of the importance in striking a balance between real-world ""actual"" interactions and virtual ""vicarious"" experiences. We have all seen negative effects of technology and social engagement in our lives and communities that usually stem from assumptions that our digital or ""virtual"" experiences are not the same as in real life, leading to communications and actions that would otherwise never occur. He goes further to suggest that we must identify and develop personal ""stability zones"" that nurture our personal connections to one another or risk getting lost along the way, such as maintaining a healthy diet, exercise and leisure with strong, intimate relationships.Alvin successfully predicts that success supported by technology would necessitate invention simply to remain competitive while also emphasizing the important role of collaborative governance among businesses and governments as new technology is developed and introduced. He also correctly forecasts product variety and consumer choice as a result of all of this technology creation."
48,0553101501,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4876036-mitch-anderson,3,"Ignore the year of publication and rest assured — you’re sure to learn something of interest from Alvin Toffler’s Future Shock. Outside of a few dated terms, much of what Toffler speaks to — the social, economic, political, and technological trends of the past, present and future — are addressed through their functional and affective aspects rather than broad speculation over the physical forms and precise implementations to which they are to take. For a book written in 1970, there’s still plenty of relevant information in here to think about.Toffler begins by giving us a broad overview of the state of contemporary society as it stood just as the USA’s golden age was coming to a close. Much of the initial chapters provide overviews of the sociological and psychosocial viewpoints of an uprooted and hyperactive tech-enabled “technosociety” (one of a few dated terms). Touching on the subjects of alienation, grounding, values and belief systems, a la carte lifestyles, political representation and knowledge, Toffler leaves no stone unturned as he exposes to us to the stark realities of the social dysfunction already well underway at the time of publication. Though it paints a rather bleak image of the future, much of what he speaks to remains entirely relevant today.Following the bleak evaluation of the foreseeable future insofar as he sees it, Toffler then speaks to the positive benefits and revelations that change is capable of producing. His case for the essential nature of change is well put though, at best, merely levels the scale between the pros and cons of our collective future.The final bit Toffler falls to a slightly more speculative but entirely theoretical tone in which he discusses some of his own potential solutions to mitigating the worst case social scenarios first presented and to the essential tasks he deemed necessary for our successful, albeit inevitable, march forward in time."
49,0553101501,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22452050-john,4,"3.5/5 — Shocking how many areas Toffler got right about the future. For a solid 75% of the book it’s easy to forget this was published 50 years ago, and then that other 25% makes you appreciate just how uncertain the year 2020 must have been. The most surprising result of reading this was this sense I developed that the world hasn’t really change that much. Sure, we’re technologically more advanced, and we’ve made fairly remarkable progress socially, but many of our stresses are the same. These paragraphs feel like that could have been published this week in a major news outlet:————Great cities are paralyzed by strikes, power failures, riots. International power alliances are shaken. Financial and political leaders secretly tremble--not out of fear that communist (or capitalist) revolutionaries will oust them, but that the entire system is somehow flying out of control.These are indisputable signs of a sick social structure, a society that can no longer perform even its most basic functions in the accustomed ways. It is a society caught in the agony of revolutionary change. In the 1920's and 1930's, communists used to speak of the ""general crisis of capitalism."" It is now clear that they were thinking small. What is occurring now is not a crisis of capitalism, but of industrial society itself, regardless of political form. We are simultaneously experiencing a youth revolution, a sexual revolution, a racial revolution, a colonial revolution, an economic revolution, and the most rapid and deep-going technological revolution in history. We are living through the general crisis of industrialism. In a word, we are in the midst of the super-industrial revolution.—————If the future scares you or excites you...this might be a good book to crack open. Certainly not for everyone though. "

This book influenced my understanding of technology, and helped me better understand the human context of relationships with technology today. Many of the cultural conditions and the relationships with technology in the past, have contributed to and thus can help us better understand our cultural conditions and relationships with technology today. Some of these things from the past that were discussed that I liked most, which help us understand the present:Disposability, consumption culture, and less attachment to specific places and things (we are often relocating for school and work and purchasing cheap new goods rather than repairing expensive existing goods). All of this may contribute to the transience we feel, the psychic pains from which I think we try to avoid through heavy interaction with social media and communication technology with our phones, texts, and emails... which I also think we try to avoid through general stimulation from today's more cheap, accessible modern drugs: video games and pornography.The main point is how the speed of technological change challenges our ability to understand it, process it, and adapt our behavior. Which is why he thinks there should be more attention to how it's shaping our lives in the present and will in the future (more futurists)."

Today we are fast approaching the day when the body can no longer be regarded as fixed.

Choice - and the criteria for choice - will be critical.” p.187 “Despite profound ethical questions about whether they should, the fact remains that scientific curiosity is, itself, one of the most powerful driving forces in our society.” p.189 “Many of us feel instinctive revulsion at the hazards of meddling with the finely balanced and far reaching systems that make an individual what he is. Yet I believe it will surely be done or attempted. The pathway will be built from a combination of altruism, private profit, and ignorance. -Dr. Rollin D.

I found that author is merely affected by sexizm, racizm and many other -izms, noticeable even for my russian origin. I am wondering, was it that bad at USA back in seventies? LOOOOLBtw, that book reminds me Futorology Congress by Stanislav Lem, that part about huge building built on seven columns, each of those reflects one of major religions. Lack of classical education makes author to create very sophisticated constructs, like five components: things, place, people, people place in socium and information. Author is trying to analyze everything by applying these five to it, but even failed to structurize his own book within these limitations. But, somehow he is right, life is getting faster, and, not everybody like that. Very noticeable part of that book is a way how author uses and interprets statistical data, very biased -izmish way, but, looks like it is quite common, especially in modern society.The best part of this book is it's name Future Shock, which was derived from Culture Shock, and I found it very lyrical :)Would not say that i like that book at all."

It was a surreal experience reading this - nothing felt shocking and nothing jarred... and then I would remember that he wrote this 47 years ago. For the most part, it is an extraordinary portrayal of the then-future/now-present and the challenges of transience, diversity, novelty and pace that he foresaw in 1970 have come home to roost: the cracks in democratic process, the opportunity for conscious evolution through gene technologies, the ever-increasing weight borne by our social services and education systems to look far enough ahead in order to create infrastructures that will be fit for future purpose.Toffler refers to Future Shock as his diagnosis, claiming ""we cannot begin to help ourselves until we become sensitively conscious of the problem."" He does offer a few solutions in Part 6: Strategies for Survival but these lack the detail and depth of the other five sections of the book. It's a thought-provoking read when you consider his foresight and wonder who today will portray our future 50 years out with similar prescience."

As I came across it on a bookshelf, even if in French, I started reading it asap.And I wasn't disappointed: first, the translation is absolutely perfect - hats off! Secondly, I kept wondering along each chapter why the analysis of the society back in the 70s could still apply half a century later... The main trends around the acceleration of change for all aspects in life (technological, (inter)personal, professional, etc.) are still so valid today that this is almost frightening...What did happen in the meantime?? Didn't the 80s also bring many societal changes? Or the Internet revolution in the late 90s? How come do we have the feeling that changes are still accelerating - and that most of the ""solutions"" proposed in the book could still apply today?This is a book I enjoyed reading, not to finger-point where the author didn't foresee something, but to reflect my own current situation and try to anticipate better the future shock :)"

It was way better than the last nonfiction book I read that was published in 2019.But he kind of lost me towards the end. He fails to predict the internet so he suggests “social assemblies” where everyone participates in decision making. And it’s like nobody has time for that! He doesn’t have a lot of faith in the system, and thinks we need to have all these meetings to predict the future. But if everyone was working to the future we would advance faster. He predicts that we will all be cyborgs in the future, writing in 1970. Then just sort of mentions computers and goes on. But it turns out it is really difficult to engineer medical devices.He does get sex robots right though. Apparently sex robots have been in the making for hundreds of years. Yes, men invented sex dolls as soon as they could. Also he suggests that in addition to History we could have a Future class, which is a good idea."

People keep on chanting ""change"" & ""being agile or you will perish"" kind of stuff. It sounds vague as their arguments remain unidimensional. Future Shock is able to cover all the aspects of humanity undergoing the roller coaster of alterations. It is so fun to read a reader can relate his life, the transition he witnessed around him from childhood to present. The part where my eyes got big was our future. The writer took today's practice and predicted our coming time. It was so convincing as if you are actually a part of it. Sometime readers may feel if the content is getting repeated but patience is the key because every chapter is completely new dimension relating other things. This book will you give extreme clarity about what is currently happening around & how to deal with it. I am literally forcing my close one to read this book and looking forward to reading other books of Alvin Toffler."
58,0553101501,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5974394-matt,2,"An interesting concept dragged out into an overlong book. Half of it could have been cut with none of the content or ideas missing.It wasn't an important part of the book for me, but most of the future predictions were way off the mark - all predictions of the future seem to be far too optimistic in regards to dates. I sometimes wonder if this is something that's done on purpose, especially when selling a book. If you read a book in 1970 and it's predicting things for 2070 when you'll be long dead, you probably won't care as much as if they were predictions for the year 2000, when you'd be alive. I was impressed by his nearly perfect prediction of the Alexa device. I also liked his views on ""overchoice"" and what an issue that would become. I primarily read this to learn a bit more about the issues that can arise when society goes through rapid changes, like we are now, but I wouldn't say I gained a huge amount of insight. To sum the book up, extreme change can trigger lots of negative bodily reactions and it can affect a person's ability to act rationally."
59,0553101501,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10955515-neeraj,4,"In Future Shock, Toffler takes an incredibly fascinating look at the changes reverberating through super-industrial societies such as the U.S. and U.K. in the last 1960s and early 1970s. Toffler's decision to analyze then-current events and trends (e.g., countercultural movements and overconsumption of environmental resources) to predict what could happen in super-industrial societies in the next few decades proves insightful. Though Future Shock certainly drags at parts and some parts devolve into strange science fiction fantasies (underwater civilizations? cyborgs?), his analysis is remarkably prescient. I particularly enjoyed when Toffler predicted political and technological developments that we see today, such as the rise of an ideologue urging us to return to the ""glory days"" (Trump, anyone?) and the production of self-expression media, such as podcasts and online video. Future Shock isn't exactly a beach read, but it was well worth the time and effort I put into it. 9/10 stars."

It's amazing how a lot of the concerns and ideas are still relevant today. This is a quick read, however, I have too much read, so have been taking my time. Heavily influenced by Buckminster Fuller, and Toffler does seem to repeat himself often with out saying much in certain subparts of his chapters, but when he comes up with an idea, it strikes. What is wonderful is paging through his bibliography and finding other similar authors and theorists of the era (mid to late 60s) to read or add to the book shelf"

Toffler's fine work continues to amaze and surprise me with its accurate predictions. Future Shock, ahead of its time, explores the human socio-economic and psychological understanding and applies it to maximum effect. That at this point, upon reading sentence upon logical sentence, everything could only be nodded and agreed at. Perhaps not all arguments flexed in this book may be fully accurate, but for a book published way back then when these concepts were close to foreign - It makes reading it a delight and would definitely send shivers down your spine."

I can't help but feel that the moon landing of 1969 somehow inspired this book.I really enjoyed this work, even if it was a bit depressing. In a nutshell what this book says is that we can expect from the future a more modular, segmented life, this includes personal lives as well. I've only taken off one star because I feel some of the adaptation strategies towards the future may be kind of lacking, but for a tough book judge like myself 4 stars is a very high rating, therefore I recommend this book if you're on the fence about reading it."

This book, as well as the title, which became a household phrase, is more profound now than in the late sixties.

I borrowed this book from a university library upon a recommendation of a previous colleague of mine. I know that English is a second language for me but I reckon the language of the book would feel the same to a millenial natove English speaker."

Written 45 years ago, this concept is still very relevant, maye be even more relevant than in 1970. Book contains interesting concepts and is only occasionaly far of the mark with futuristic predictions.I also liked the concept of adhocracy that will replace bureaucracy; increases adaptability of organizations (I suppose current term would be 'agile') but strains adaptibility of men."

72,0553101501,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13459886-yhc,2,"In my previous book Present Shock: When Everything Happens Now that i enjoyed a lot, it mentioned about this very famous book, future shock and i have it with me for long but never got the chance to read it(also all his other books that i will surely read over ). This book was published in 1970, almost 5 decades ago, therefore i read it as a sci-fi futurist book with the touch of Utopian style. Considering it has been almost 50 years old, Toffler got pretty precise prediction on most of the things he predicted in the book, but what i want to mentioned here is the one he failed to predicted and the reality was rather disappointing. Most of his predictions are around society, education, population change, science development, human relationship, companies...etc.1. He didn't mention anything about globalization, I think at that time this is still pretty new. We feel the commerce is going to develop over continents but globally in the way we are today is indeed fast.2. He didn't mention about banking system would actually became such fatal role to control this planet, the repeated financial crisis doesn't teach us to learn lessons.3. The political development was rarely mentioned, he mentioned about socialist democracy but not capitalized communism...who would know that the biggest politically communism, China, embrace capitalism economically so well now.4. During the cold war, Soviet and USA had space race so we sent people to space and to the moon. In this book, Toffler mentioned many times about space development would reach certain level that we will have so ""many"" astronomers actually live in ISS. (heartache!) Who would know that 50 years later, our astronomers only stay on earth orbit, and never set their foot back to the moon. Luckily we have a big dreams soon with SpaceX to go beyond the moon. Let's pack soon to Mars. Am I allowed to dream big before i get old?5. In Toffler's farest dream, he would never know that one day, the war between 2 countries could be like Virtual Reality games. One side with real casualties, the other would remotely control the drone through screen in another side of the earth, after the mission is done, this few people military still can go back home having dinner with their family. (mentioned in my last book Present Shock: When Everything Happens Now ) 6. Far from training dolphins to be our deep sea exploring partners, we exploit their home, pollute their space into continental size of plastic island. Well done Humans! And of course, we hunt dolphins ,whales, and many other kinds of sea animals with big corporation ship that spare-nothing-kind-of-fishing Nets. (wonder why they don't use their super Nets to clean up the plastic island shit instead)7. Genetically modified on Wild animals to be more docile? Why? Toffler? I thought most of them are killed by humans, docile or not, we just invade their home for the sake of humans!8. 24 hours day light thanks to big mirror reflect from space with satellites to light up the dark side of earth. Toffler mentioned about day light needed in winter time of Scandinavia, which is understandable. for plants to grow, yes. But if for the sake of industry 24 hours function, so human also taking shift to keep working. No way.....give this poor ear a break! we have enough stuff that we don't really need but fabricated. I think this book still have many things for us to actually take into consideration, but like i say, the power is in the hands of big corporations, they don't care about what skin colors we are, what political situation you believe, they just want money!! and Money craving is good enough to destroy this world, and that is the biggest shock!"

Yet, the book is a great read...if you think it's science fiction. These events laid out in this book were not BOUND TO HAPPEN, they were FORCED TO HAPPEN, much like the Shadow Wars in Babylon 5. It wasn't destiny, so much as brain-washing, that makes this future a real possibility.""Future Shock"" is one of the first books to lay out how the unscrupulous would use what we now call ""persuasive technology"" to ensure the rise of a corporate feudal system. from the golden age of corporate capitalism where criminal elements within the Nixon government and corporations began to be recognized as NORMAL. If you didn't realize this, you better go back and read ""Future Shock"" and the companion books again. Most people read Toffler's books and see themselves as the ONE who will rise above the dross. Don't be fooled. This book, Future Shock, is one of a set of cookbooks, including ""The Third Wave"", ""Power Shift"" and others that have been used to ""cook up"" a dismal future for most humans. If you aren't IN THE GROUP MAKING THIS HAPPEN, you aren't in...you are among the dross.At one time, I thought Toffler would find people to put on the brakes to this change in worldview, but that never happened. Let me remind you that NONE OF US who use and rely on public online spaces will be in the upper or even midling echelons of future/present/past feudal leaders. Some politicians like Newt Gingrich and others helped Toffler create this new world through the various laws and groups who control the ""confused"" majority. It's highly unlikely that those of us who saw it all along will make much of a dent in stopping it. When I read Future Shock, I was also reading a great many other books which aligned with the future or aligned with this book in science fiction. It took me a decade before I figured out that this man was laying out A REAL PLAN to put most of us (the 99%) into a state of modern servitude where governments and constitutions of the 2oth century have fallen. The independent person had fallen. There is no fiction here. Think of this plan as an explanation of how Huxley's ""Brave New World"" could come into existence.It seems to me that Toffler's writing style was very engaging, yet alarming in the way he spoke of a return to a recognizable feudal state. A CORPORATE feudal state was described and honored by Toffler. I remember wondering if this could be resisted. I learned that it could not. From the late 1980's until Toffler's death, I watched as he wrote less for a public audience and more for a nouveau feudal ruling class. He and his wife gave conferences and developed relationships with ""leaders"" to maximize ways to create the new corporate feudal system. It seemed to me that he and his wife were glad to be plugged into the process of turning the majority of humans into corporate serfs. I remember one part of his first book included warnings that you would not be able to resist. If you did resist, you would be completely locked out of the corporate-based feudal world. This meant that personal ownership outside the corporate feudal systems would eventually disappear, unless you had some value to the overlords. Take these books for what you will. If you're confused, don't worry...you are just where Toffler and his minions knew you would be."

As a book about the future and how to adapt to its inevitable change it was an interesting time to read it. Due to the fact that I am 50 years removed from the world in which it was written in I am given a very different mindset to read it in. My enjoyment of the book comes partially from looking back with 2020 hindsight and partially from finding its original message still relevant today. The introductory chapters of this book explain just how fast our society started moving in the 20th century. Compared to today this rate of advancement has only increased in acceleration. 1970 marks one of the earliest generations to notice how fast information moves and how quick things can change. I can only imagine how intense this period must have been as no other period of human history progress at the pace of the first 70 years of the 20th century, at that point.A lot of the first half of the book discusses many of the trends of 1970. Toffler projects how changes that happened in the prior half of the 20th century will affect the years after. It was great to see what was seen as revolutionary or points of interest to a person of this time. As someone who finds the 20th century to be one of the most interesting points of history to study, a lot of this book was a pleasure to read. There is a wide variety of subjects covered in this book. Because of this some chapters might interest certain readers more than others. By covering all of these trends the book can feel like it is part history, sociology, philosophy, anthropology, futurist, and business. As a business school graduate some of the chapters on consumer trends were great insight into marketing knowledge of the day, even if some of the information is rudimentary today.Toffler makes many speculations about the future and surprisingly a lot of them turn out to have become true. Granted there are a few subjects he misses on but they are still fun to read about, they just feel more sci-fi than realistic.The overall message of Future Shock is to address the trend of rapid change that forces human beings obsolete if they don't know how to adapt with the changes and learn current information. He offers so many great insights and the fact that they are still relevant really shows how this book is still useful to read today. That being said, reading this 50 years on and realizing not that much has changed is a depressing thought. If more people had read this book back then and incorporated its message into their lives maybe we'd have solve more of societies issues. Its also ironic that many of the people who would have been youth at the point of publishing this book are now the elder, ruling class, failing to adapt to our current world, holding us back. Maybe this is just part of the human condition and it is inevitable that we will fail future generations.Overall I would recommend anyone looking for insight into life during 1970 as well as a better way of looking at the future to read this book. It is well worth it."
75,0553101501,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20926327-lora-shouse,4,"When I was in college Future Shock was all over the shelves at the bookstore and everywhere. Obviously, I should have read it then. A least I could have added it to my book list; I hadn’t closed the first list at that time. But honestly, I don’t know when I would have had the time to read it. And anyway, there were other things I was more interested in at the time.When I was putting books on my second list years later, it occurred to me that I hadn’t ever read Future Shock, and, somewhat surprised that it was still around, I added it to the list at that time. So, now I have finally read it.The first three-quarters of the book or so are pretty fun. Toffler surveys some of the rapidly multiplying different ways of living that were coming into being or looked about to be coming into being and looks at the consequences of too much (or too little) change at one time. At close to fifty years later, I can say that much of what he predicted has in fact happened. I can’t vouch for every little thing he talked about, but he was right on the money about a lot of things like corporate mindset and changes in work – I have lived through a lot of exactly what he was talking about.I’m not sure the pace of change ever got to quite what he expected it to. It was, and still is, plenty fast, mind you, and for those people living on the cutting edge of change all the time I’m sure plenty have and still do experience the negative effects he pointed out. Maybe the increase in the rate of change finally got to a point where it could not keep continuing. Maybe factors such as the environmental movement began to act as kind of a drag on the pace of some kinds of changes. Maybe a large proportion of the population was just not able to change that fast. Anyway, I don’t think that the rate of change ever got quite as out-of-hand as he thought it might. At least not yet.The last quarter of the book, where he talks about what we can do to buffer ourselves against the worst of future shock is a little more boring. A lot of this is suggestions for suggestions. Some of it has been tried, at least on a limited basis. Occasionally cities will get together a planning group to try to plan out some aspects of their future – like what to do about transportation or jobs or living space. But I don’t think this has ever been done very extensively on a national or global level, or very often even on a more local level. And I’m not sure anybody knows how to educate children for a future that we don’t even know what it is yet.This was a library book."
76,0553101501,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12083674-michael-david,5,"When this book was written during the 1970s, the world was at the brink of a technological big bang. Alvin Toffler noticed the signs. He wrote about the signs and elaborated upon them in this book, Future Shock. 'Future shock' was the term he coined for the disease that would afflict unprepared individuals in the future. If I can describe the book in one word, it would be comprehensive. His treatise is full of corroborative references: in fact, 80 pages of the book are all his references. Notable among his points is that more knowledge has been accrued in the past fifty years than in the time between the 15th and 19th century. Among the important points in his treatise is the idea of transience pervading over our everyday lives. Everything is transient - not only things and places, but more importantly, even knowledge and people.In addition, the future also brings with it much novelty and an infinity of choices. Through numerous examples, Toffler claims that it is the lack of rootedness and the difficulty of choice that drives a lot of people towards a breakdown. Given what I perceive nowadays, it's impressive that Toffler was generally right. He had accurately predicted the irascibility of humans at this day and age: millennials nowadays have girlfriends or boyfriends as young as the age of ten; teenage pregnancies are becoming more and more common, and the lack of stability and rootedness within the family and society has fragmented less robust families. One shortcoming from Toffler's book was his inability to predict the repercussions of the personal computer. Because he was unable to predict the advent of the PC through the efforts of pioneers like Wozniak, Gates, and Jobs, he, in effect was conservative in his estimates. The personal computer drastically optimized the speed of new technologies entering our society and culture. The increased speed in computation transformed society, both positively and negatively: while we have information and knowledge at our fingertips, with ease of access, we also have developmentally delayed four-year old children whose tablets have become substitutes for creativity. Well, I guess Toffler was right all along: future shock has arrived. "
77,0553101501,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4872710-eric-swanson,3,"Was a crystal ball for society and technology.Alvin's insights in this book included many accurate predictions for how society would engage and embrace technology in the past future. The book is an easy read with points that continue to have some resonance.Have you ever felt that change was coming too fast and frequently? This is a core tenant of Future Shock, written in a time when computer technology was new, adapting, and accelerating; where technology innovation continues presently. Alvin suggests that society and individuals must be willing to adapt as crucial criteria for success. He highlights that organizations and the world itself will adopt more fluid, shifting structures and interactions based on enabling technology. The internet as well as personal devices today are perfect examples for the fluid nature of how our social, professional and personal interactions with technology are tightly intertwined. However, he warns of the importance in striking a balance between real-world ""actual"" interactions and virtual ""vicarious"" experiences. We have all seen negative effects of technology and social engagement in our lives and communities that usually stem from assumptions that our digital or ""virtual"" experiences are not the same as in real life, leading to communications and actions that would otherwise never occur. He goes further to suggest that we must identify and develop personal ""stability zones"" that nurture our personal connections to one another or risk getting lost along the way, such as maintaining a healthy diet, exercise and leisure with strong, intimate relationships.Alvin successfully predicts that success supported by technology would necessitate invention simply to remain competitive while also emphasizing the important role of collaborative governance among businesses and governments as new technology is developed and introduced. He also correctly forecasts product variety and consumer choice as a result of all of this technology creation."
78,0553101501,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4876036-mitch-anderson,3,"Ignore the year of publication and rest assured — you’re sure to learn something of interest from Alvin Toffler’s Future Shock. Outside of a few dated terms, much of what Toffler speaks to — the social, economic, political, and technological trends of the past, present and future — are addressed through their functional and affective aspects rather than broad speculation over the physical forms and precise implementations to which they are to take. For a book written in 1970, there’s still plenty of relevant information in here to think about.Toffler begins by giving us a broad overview of the state of contemporary society as it stood just as the USA’s golden age was coming to a close. Much of the initial chapters provide overviews of the sociological and psychosocial viewpoints of an uprooted and hyperactive tech-enabled “technosociety” (one of a few dated terms). Touching on the subjects of alienation, grounding, values and belief systems, a la carte lifestyles, political representation and knowledge, Toffler leaves no stone unturned as he exposes to us to the stark realities of the social dysfunction already well underway at the time of publication. Though it paints a rather bleak image of the future, much of what he speaks to remains entirely relevant today.Following the bleak evaluation of the foreseeable future insofar as he sees it, Toffler then speaks to the positive benefits and revelations that change is capable of producing. His case for the essential nature of change is well put though, at best, merely levels the scale between the pros and cons of our collective future.The final bit Toffler falls to a slightly more speculative but entirely theoretical tone in which he discusses some of his own potential solutions to mitigating the worst case social scenarios first presented and to the essential tasks he deemed necessary for our successful, albeit inevitable, march forward in time."
79,0553101501,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22452050-john,4,"3.5/5 — Shocking how many areas Toffler got right about the future. For a solid 75% of the book it’s easy to forget this was published 50 years ago, and then that other 25% makes you appreciate just how uncertain the year 2020 must have been. The most surprising result of reading this was this sense I developed that the world hasn’t really change that much. Sure, we’re technologically more advanced, and we’ve made fairly remarkable progress socially, but many of our stresses are the same. These paragraphs feel like that could have been published this week in a major news outlet:————Great cities are paralyzed by strikes, power failures, riots. International power alliances are shaken. Financial and political leaders secretly tremble--not out of fear that communist (or capitalist) revolutionaries will oust them, but that the entire system is somehow flying out of control.These are indisputable signs of a sick social structure, a society that can no longer perform even its most basic functions in the accustomed ways. It is a society caught in the agony of revolutionary change. In the 1920's and 1930's, communists used to speak of the ""general crisis of capitalism."" It is now clear that they were thinking small. What is occurring now is not a crisis of capitalism, but of industrial society itself, regardless of political form. We are simultaneously experiencing a youth revolution, a sexual revolution, a racial revolution, a colonial revolution, an economic revolution, and the most rapid and deep-going technological revolution in history. We are living through the general crisis of industrialism. In a word, we are in the midst of the super-industrial revolution.—————If the future scares you or excites you...this might be a good book to crack open. Certainly not for everyone though. "

This book influenced my understanding of technology, and helped me better understand the human context of relationships with technology today. Many of the cultural conditions and the relationships with technology in the past, have contributed to and thus can help us better understand our cultural conditions and relationships with technology today. Some of these things from the past that were discussed that I liked most, which help us understand the present:Disposability, consumption culture, and less attachment to specific places and things (we are often relocating for school and work and purchasing cheap new goods rather than repairing expensive existing goods). All of this may contribute to the transience we feel, the psychic pains from which I think we try to avoid through heavy interaction with social media and communication technology with our phones, texts, and emails... which I also think we try to avoid through general stimulation from today's more cheap, accessible modern drugs: video games and pornography.The main point is how the speed of technological change challenges our ability to understand it, process it, and adapt our behavior. Which is why he thinks there should be more attention to how it's shaping our lives in the present and will in the future (more futurists)."

I found that author is merely affected by sexizm, racizm and many other -izms, noticeable even for my russian origin. I am wondering, was it that bad at USA back in seventies? LOOOOLBtw, that book reminds me Futorology Congress by Stanislav Lem, that part about huge building built on seven columns, each of those reflects one of major religions. Lack of classical education makes author to create very sophisticated constructs, like five components: things, place, people, people place in socium and information. Author is trying to analyze everything by applying these five to it, but even failed to structurize his own book within these limitations. But, somehow he is right, life is getting faster, and, not everybody like that. Very noticeable part of that book is a way how author uses and interprets statistical data, very biased -izmish way, but, looks like it is quite common, especially in modern society.The best part of this book is it's name Future Shock, which was derived from Culture Shock, and I found it very lyrical :)Would not say that i like that book at all."

It was a surreal experience reading this - nothing felt shocking and nothing jarred... and then I would remember that he wrote this 47 years ago. For the most part, it is an extraordinary portrayal of the then-future/now-present and the challenges of transience, diversity, novelty and pace that he foresaw in 1970 have come home to roost: the cracks in democratic process, the opportunity for conscious evolution through gene technologies, the ever-increasing weight borne by our social services and education systems to look far enough ahead in order to create infrastructures that will be fit for future purpose.Toffler refers to Future Shock as his diagnosis, claiming ""we cannot begin to help ourselves until we become sensitively conscious of the problem."" He does offer a few solutions in Part 6: Strategies for Survival but these lack the detail and depth of the other five sections of the book. It's a thought-provoking read when you consider his foresight and wonder who today will portray our future 50 years out with similar prescience."

As I came across it on a bookshelf, even if in French, I started reading it asap.And I wasn't disappointed: first, the translation is absolutely perfect - hats off! Secondly, I kept wondering along each chapter why the analysis of the society back in the 70s could still apply half a century later... The main trends around the acceleration of change for all aspects in life (technological, (inter)personal, professional, etc.) are still so valid today that this is almost frightening...What did happen in the meantime?? Didn't the 80s also bring many societal changes? Or the Internet revolution in the late 90s? How come do we have the feeling that changes are still accelerating - and that most of the ""solutions"" proposed in the book could still apply today?This is a book I enjoyed reading, not to finger-point where the author didn't foresee something, but to reflect my own current situation and try to anticipate better the future shock :)"

It was way better than the last nonfiction book I read that was published in 2019.But he kind of lost me towards the end. He fails to predict the internet so he suggests “social assemblies” where everyone participates in decision making. And it’s like nobody has time for that! He doesn’t have a lot of faith in the system, and thinks we need to have all these meetings to predict the future. But if everyone was working to the future we would advance faster. He predicts that we will all be cyborgs in the future, writing in 1970. Then just sort of mentions computers and goes on. But it turns out it is really difficult to engineer medical devices.He does get sex robots right though. Apparently sex robots have been in the making for hundreds of years. Yes, men invented sex dolls as soon as they could. Also he suggests that in addition to History we could have a Future class, which is a good idea."

People keep on chanting ""change"" & ""being agile or you will perish"" kind of stuff. It sounds vague as their arguments remain unidimensional. Future Shock is able to cover all the aspects of humanity undergoing the roller coaster of alterations. It is so fun to read a reader can relate his life, the transition he witnessed around him from childhood to present. The part where my eyes got big was our future. The writer took today's practice and predicted our coming time. It was so convincing as if you are actually a part of it. Sometime readers may feel if the content is getting repeated but patience is the key because every chapter is completely new dimension relating other things. This book will you give extreme clarity about what is currently happening around & how to deal with it.

Half of it could have been cut with none of the content or ideas missing.It wasn't an important part of the book for me, but most of the future predictions were way off the mark - all predictions of the future seem to be far too optimistic in regards to dates. I sometimes wonder if this is something that's done on purpose, especially when selling a book. If you read a book in 1970 and it's predicting things for 2070 when you'll be long dead, you probably won't care as much as if they were predictions for the year 2000, when you'd be alive. I was impressed by his nearly perfect prediction of the Alexa device. I also liked his views on ""overchoice"" and what an issue that would become. I primarily read this to learn a bit more about the issues that can arise when society goes through rapid changes, like we are now, but I wouldn't say I gained a huge amount of insight. To sum the book up, extreme change can trigger lots of negative bodily reactions and it can affect a person's ability to act rationally."

Toffler's decision to analyze then-current events and trends (e.g., countercultural movements and overconsumption of environmental resources) to predict what could happen in super-industrial societies in the next few decades proves insightful. Though Future Shock certainly drags at parts and some parts devolve into strange science fiction fantasies (underwater civilizations? cyborgs?), his analysis is remarkably prescient. I particularly enjoyed when Toffler predicted political and technological developments that we see today, such as the rise of an ideologue urging us to return to the ""glory days"" (Trump, anyone?) and the production of self-expression media, such as podcasts and online video. Future Shock isn't exactly a beach read, but it was well worth the time and effort I put into it. 9/10 stars."

It's amazing how a lot of the concerns and ideas are still relevant today. This is a quick read, however, I have too much read, so have been taking my time. Heavily influenced by Buckminster Fuller, and Toffler does seem to repeat himself often with out saying much in certain subparts of his chapters, but when he comes up with an idea, it strikes. What is wonderful is paging through his bibliography and finding other similar authors and theorists of the era (mid to late 60s) to read or add to the book shelf"

Future Shock, ahead of its time, explores the human socio-economic and psychological understanding and applies it to maximum effect. That at this point, upon reading sentence upon logical sentence, everything could only be nodded and agreed at. Perhaps not all arguments flexed in this book may be fully accurate, but for a book published way back then when these concepts were close to foreign - It makes reading it a delight and would definitely send shivers down your spine."

I've only taken off one star because I feel some of the adaptation strategies towards the future may be kind of lacking, but for a tough book judge like myself 4 stars is a very high rating, therefore I recommend this book if you're on the fence about reading it."

101,0553101501,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4385478-abhishek-shekhar,3,Some facets mentioned in book are turning true now as well. Good to see how changes become shock. Book is even more relevant in the changing world now as we see changes in everything around us.
102,0553101501,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13459886-yhc,2,"In my previous book Present Shock: When Everything Happens Now that i enjoyed a lot, it mentioned about this very famous book, future shock and i have it with me for long but never got the chance to read it(also all his other books that i will surely read over ). This book was published in 1970, almost 5 decades ago, therefore i read it as a sci-fi futurist book with the touch of Utopian style. Considering it has been almost 50 years old, Toffler got pretty precise prediction on most of the things he predicted in the book, but what i want to mentioned here is the one he failed to predicted and the reality was rather disappointing. Most of his predictions are around society, education, population change, science development, human relationship, companies...etc.1. He didn't mention anything about globalization, I think at that time this is still pretty new. We feel the commerce is going to develop over continents but globally in the way we are today is indeed fast.2. He didn't mention about banking system would actually became such fatal role to control this planet, the repeated financial crisis doesn't teach us to learn lessons.3. The political development was rarely mentioned, he mentioned about socialist democracy but not capitalized communism...who would know that the biggest politically communism, China, embrace capitalism economically so well now.4. During the cold war, Soviet and USA had space race so we sent people to space and to the moon. In this book, Toffler mentioned many times about space development would reach certain level that we will have so ""many"" astronomers actually live in ISS. (heartache!) Who would know that 50 years later, our astronomers only stay on earth orbit, and never set their foot back to the moon. Luckily we have a big dreams soon with SpaceX to go beyond the moon. Let's pack soon to Mars. Am I allowed to dream big before i get old?5. In Toffler's farest dream, he would never know that one day, the war between 2 countries could be like Virtual Reality games. One side with real casualties, the other would remotely control the drone through screen in another side of the earth, after the mission is done, this few people military still can go back home having dinner with their family. (mentioned in my last book Present Shock: When Everything Happens Now ) 6. Far from training dolphins to be our deep sea exploring partners, we exploit their home, pollute their space into continental size of plastic island. Well done Humans! And of course, we hunt dolphins ,whales, and many other kinds of sea animals with big corporation ship that spare-nothing-kind-of-fishing Nets. (wonder why they don't use their super Nets to clean up the plastic island shit instead)7. Genetically modified on Wild animals to be more docile? Why? Toffler? I thought most of them are killed by humans, docile or not, we just invade their home for the sake of humans!8. 24 hours day light thanks to big mirror reflect from space with satellites to light up the dark side of earth. Toffler mentioned about day light needed in winter time of Scandinavia, which is understandable. for plants to grow, yes. But if for the sake of industry 24 hours function, so human also taking shift to keep working. No way.....give this poor ear a break! we have enough stuff that we don't really need but fabricated. I think this book still have many things for us to actually take into consideration, but like i say, the power is in the hands of big corporations, they don't care about what skin colors we are, what political situation you believe, they just want money!! and Money craving is good enough to destroy this world, and that is the biggest shock!"
103,0553101501,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63892286-sheryl-mccoy,5,"It's difficult to rate ""Future Shock"" highly when reading it is like watching the destruction of civilization in slow motion. Yet, the book is a great read...if you think it's science fiction. These events laid out in this book were not BOUND TO HAPPEN, they were FORCED TO HAPPEN, much like the Shadow Wars in Babylon 5. It wasn't destiny, so much as brain-washing, that makes this future a real possibility.""Future Shock"" is one of the first books to lay out how the unscrupulous would use what we now call ""persuasive technology"" to ensure the rise of a corporate feudal system. from the golden age of corporate capitalism where criminal elements within the Nixon government and corporations began to be recognized as NORMAL. If you didn't realize this, you better go back and read ""Future Shock"" and the companion books again. Most people read Toffler's books and see themselves as the ONE who will rise above the dross. Don't be fooled. This book, Future Shock, is one of a set of cookbooks, including ""The Third Wave"", ""Power Shift"" and others that have been used to ""cook up"" a dismal future for most humans. If you aren't IN THE GROUP MAKING THIS HAPPEN, you aren't in...you are among the dross.At one time, I thought Toffler would find people to put on the brakes to this change in worldview, but that never happened. Let me remind you that NONE OF US who use and rely on public online spaces will be in the upper or even midling echelons of future/present/past feudal leaders. Some politicians like Newt Gingrich and others helped Toffler create this new world through the various laws and groups who control the ""confused"" majority. It's highly unlikely that those of us who saw it all along will make much of a dent in stopping it. When I read Future Shock, I was also reading a great many other books which aligned with the future or aligned with this book in science fiction. It took me a decade before I figured out that this man was laying out A REAL PLAN to put most of us (the 99%) into a state of modern servitude where governments and constitutions of the 2oth century have fallen. The independent person had fallen. There is no fiction here. Think of this plan as an explanation of how Huxley's ""Brave New World"" could come into existence.It seems to me that Toffler's writing style was very engaging, yet alarming in the way he spoke of a return to a recognizable feudal state. A CORPORATE feudal state was described and honored by Toffler. I remember wondering if this could be resisted. I learned that it could not. From the late 1980's until Toffler's death, I watched as he wrote less for a public audience and more for a nouveau feudal ruling class. He and his wife gave conferences and developed relationships with ""leaders"" to maximize ways to create the new corporate feudal system. It seemed to me that he and his wife were glad to be plugged into the process of turning the majority of humans into corporate serfs. I remember one part of his first book included warnings that you would not be able to resist. If you did resist, you would be completely locked out of the corporate-based feudal world. This meant that personal ownership outside the corporate feudal systems would eventually disappear, unless you had some value to the overlords. Take these books for what you will. If you're confused, don't worry...you are just where Toffler and his minions knew you would be."
104,0553101501,http://goodreads.com/user/show/98347967-john,5,"2020 marks 50 years since Future Shock was first published. As a book about the future and how to adapt to its inevitable change it was an interesting time to read it. Due to the fact that I am 50 years removed from the world in which it was written in I am given a very different mindset to read it in. My enjoyment of the book comes partially from looking back with 2020 hindsight and partially from finding its original message still relevant today. The introductory chapters of this book explain just how fast our society started moving in the 20th century. Compared to today this rate of advancement has only increased in acceleration. 1970 marks one of the earliest generations to notice how fast information moves and how quick things can change. I can only imagine how intense this period must have been as no other period of human history progress at the pace of the first 70 years of the 20th century, at that point.A lot of the first half of the book discusses many of the trends of 1970. Toffler projects how changes that happened in the prior half of the 20th century will affect the years after. It was great to see what was seen as revolutionary or points of interest to a person of this time. As someone who finds the 20th century to be one of the most interesting points of history to study, a lot of this book was a pleasure to read. There is a wide variety of subjects covered in this book. Because of this some chapters might interest certain readers more than others. By covering all of these trends the book can feel like it is part history, sociology, philosophy, anthropology, futurist, and business. As a business school graduate some of the chapters on consumer trends were great insight into marketing knowledge of the day, even if some of the information is rudimentary today.Toffler makes many speculations about the future and surprisingly a lot of them turn out to have become true. Granted there are a few subjects he misses on but they are still fun to read about, they just feel more sci-fi than realistic.The overall message of Future Shock is to address the trend of rapid change that forces human beings obsolete if they don't know how to adapt with the changes and learn current information. He offers so many great insights and the fact that they are still relevant really shows how this book is still useful to read today. That being said, reading this 50 years on and realizing not that much has changed is a depressing thought. If more people had read this book back then and incorporated its message into their lives maybe we'd have solve more of societies issues. Its also ironic that many of the people who would have been youth at the point of publishing this book are now the elder, ruling class, failing to adapt to our current world, holding us back. Maybe this is just part of the human condition and it is inevitable that we will fail future generations.Overall I would recommend anyone looking for insight into life during 1970 as well as a better way of looking at the future to read this book. It is well worth it."
105,0553101501,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20926327-lora-shouse,4,"When I was in college Future Shock was all over the shelves at the bookstore and everywhere. Obviously, I should have read it then. A least I could have added it to my book list; I hadn’t closed the first list at that time. But honestly, I don’t know when I would have had the time to read it. And anyway, there were other things I was more interested in at the time.When I was putting books on my second list years later, it occurred to me that I hadn’t ever read Future Shock, and, somewhat surprised that it was still around, I added it to the list at that time. So, now I have finally read it.The first three-quarters of the book or so are pretty fun. Toffler surveys some of the rapidly multiplying different ways of living that were coming into being or looked about to be coming into being and looks at the consequences of too much (or too little) change at one time. At close to fifty years later, I can say that much of what he predicted has in fact happened. I can’t vouch for every little thing he talked about, but he was right on the money about a lot of things like corporate mindset and changes in work – I have lived through a lot of exactly what he was talking about.I’m not sure the pace of change ever got to quite what he expected it to. It was, and still is, plenty fast, mind you, and for those people living on the cutting edge of change all the time I’m sure plenty have and still do experience the negative effects he pointed out. Maybe the increase in the rate of change finally got to a point where it could not keep continuing. Maybe factors such as the environmental movement began to act as kind of a drag on the pace of some kinds of changes. Maybe a large proportion of the population was just not able to change that fast. Anyway, I don’t think that the rate of change ever got quite as out-of-hand as he thought it might. At least not yet.The last quarter of the book, where he talks about what we can do to buffer ourselves against the worst of future shock is a little more boring. A lot of this is suggestions for suggestions. Some of it has been tried, at least on a limited basis. Occasionally cities will get together a planning group to try to plan out some aspects of their future – like what to do about transportation or jobs or living space. But I don’t think this has ever been done very extensively on a national or global level, or very often even on a more local level. And I’m not sure anybody knows how to educate children for a future that we don’t even know what it is yet.This was a library book."
106,0553101501,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12083674-michael-david,5,"When this book was written during the 1970s, the world was at the brink of a technological big bang. Alvin Toffler noticed the signs. He wrote about the signs and elaborated upon them in this book, Future Shock. 'Future shock' was the term he coined for the disease that would afflict unprepared individuals in the future. If I can describe the book in one word, it would be comprehensive. His treatise is full of corroborative references: in fact, 80 pages of the book are all his references. Notable among his points is that more knowledge has been accrued in the past fifty years than in the time between the 15th and 19th century. Among the important points in his treatise is the idea of transience pervading over our everyday lives. Everything is transient - not only things and places, but more importantly, even knowledge and people.In addition, the future also brings with it much novelty and an infinity of choices. Through numerous examples, Toffler claims that it is the lack of rootedness and the difficulty of choice that drives a lot of people towards a breakdown. Given what I perceive nowadays, it's impressive that Toffler was generally right. He had accurately predicted the irascibility of humans at this day and age: millennials nowadays have girlfriends or boyfriends as young as the age of ten; teenage pregnancies are becoming more and more common, and the lack of stability and rootedness within the family and society has fragmented less robust families. One shortcoming from Toffler's book was his inability to predict the repercussions of the personal computer. Because he was unable to predict the advent of the PC through the efforts of pioneers like Wozniak, Gates, and Jobs, he, in effect was conservative in his estimates. The personal computer drastically optimized the speed of new technologies entering our society and culture. The increased speed in computation transformed society, both positively and negatively: while we have information and knowledge at our fingertips, with ease of access, we also have developmentally delayed four-year old children whose tablets have become substitutes for creativity. Well, I guess Toffler was right all along: future shock has arrived. "
107,0553101501,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4872710-eric-swanson,3,"Was a crystal ball for society and technology.Alvin's insights in this book included many accurate predictions for how society would engage and embrace technology in the past future. The book is an easy read with points that continue to have some resonance.Have you ever felt that change was coming too fast and frequently? This is a core tenant of Future Shock, written in a time when computer technology was new, adapting, and accelerating; where technology innovation continues presently. Alvin suggests that society and individuals must be willing to adapt as crucial criteria for success. He highlights that organizations and the world itself will adopt more fluid, shifting structures and interactions based on enabling technology. The internet as well as personal devices today are perfect examples for the fluid nature of how our social, professional and personal interactions with technology are tightly intertwined. However, he warns of the importance in striking a balance between real-world ""actual"" interactions and virtual ""vicarious"" experiences. We have all seen negative effects of technology and social engagement in our lives and communities that usually stem from assumptions that our digital or ""virtual"" experiences are not the same as in real life, leading to communications and actions that would otherwise never occur. He goes further to suggest that we must identify and develop personal ""stability zones"" that nurture our personal connections to one another or risk getting lost along the way, such as maintaining a healthy diet, exercise and leisure with strong, intimate relationships.Alvin successfully predicts that success supported by technology would necessitate invention simply to remain competitive while also emphasizing the important role of collaborative governance among businesses and governments as new technology is developed and introduced. He also correctly forecasts product variety and consumer choice as a result of all of this technology creation."
108,0553101501,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4876036-mitch-anderson,3,"Ignore the year of publication and rest assured — you’re sure to learn something of interest from Alvin Toffler’s Future Shock. Outside of a few dated terms, much of what Toffler speaks to — the social, economic, political, and technological trends of the past, present and future — are addressed through their functional and affective aspects rather than broad speculation over the physical forms and precise implementations to which they are to take. For a book written in 1970, there’s still plenty of relevant information in here to think about.Toffler begins by giving us a broad overview of the state of contemporary society as it stood just as the USA’s golden age was coming to a close. Much of the initial chapters provide overviews of the sociological and psychosocial viewpoints of an uprooted and hyperactive tech-enabled “technosociety” (one of a few dated terms). Touching on the subjects of alienation, grounding, values and belief systems, a la carte lifestyles, political representation and knowledge, Toffler leaves no stone unturned as he exposes to us to the stark realities of the social dysfunction already well underway at the time of publication. Though it paints a rather bleak image of the future, much of what he speaks to remains entirely relevant today.Following the bleak evaluation of the foreseeable future insofar as he sees it, Toffler then speaks to the positive benefits and revelations that change is capable of producing. His case for the essential nature of change is well put though, at best, merely levels the scale between the pros and cons of our collective future.The final bit Toffler falls to a slightly more speculative but entirely theoretical tone in which he discusses some of his own potential solutions to mitigating the worst case social scenarios first presented and to the essential tasks he deemed necessary for our successful, albeit inevitable, march forward in time."
109,0553101501,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22452050-john,4,"3.5/5 — Shocking how many areas Toffler got right about the future. For a solid 75% of the book it’s easy to forget this was published 50 years ago, and then that other 25% makes you appreciate just how uncertain the year 2020 must have been. The most surprising result of reading this was this sense I developed that the world hasn’t really change that much. Sure, we’re technologically more advanced, and we’ve made fairly remarkable progress socially, but many of our stresses are the same. These paragraphs feel like that could have been published this week in a major news outlet:————Great cities are paralyzed by strikes, power failures, riots. International power alliances are shaken. Financial and political leaders secretly tremble--not out of fear that communist (or capitalist) revolutionaries will oust them, but that the entire system is somehow flying out of control.These are indisputable signs of a sick social structure, a society that can no longer perform even its most basic functions in the accustomed ways. It is a society caught in the agony of revolutionary change. In the 1920's and 1930's, communists used to speak of the ""general crisis of capitalism."" It is now clear that they were thinking small. What is occurring now is not a crisis of capitalism, but of industrial society itself, regardless of political form. We are simultaneously experiencing a youth revolution, a sexual revolution, a racial revolution, a colonial revolution, an economic revolution, and the most rapid and deep-going technological revolution in history. We are living through the general crisis of industrialism. In a word, we are in the midst of the super-industrial revolution.—————If the future scares you or excites you...this might be a good book to crack open. Certainly not for everyone though. "

This book influenced my understanding of technology, and helped me better understand the human context of relationships with technology today. Many of the cultural conditions and the relationships with technology in the past, have contributed to and thus can help us better understand our cultural conditions and relationships with technology today. Some of these things from the past that were discussed that I liked most, which help us understand the present:Disposability, consumption culture, and less attachment to specific places and things (we are often relocating for school and work and purchasing cheap new goods rather than repairing expensive existing goods). All of this may contribute to the transience we feel, the psychic pains from which I think we try to avoid through heavy interaction with social media and communication technology with our phones, texts, and emails... which I also think we try to avoid through general stimulation from today's more cheap, accessible modern drugs: video games and pornography.The main point is how the speed of technological change challenges our ability to understand it, process it, and adapt our behavior. Which is why he thinks there should be more attention to how it's shaping our lives in the present and will in the future (more futurists)."

I found that author is merely affected by sexizm, racizm and many other -izms, noticeable even for my russian origin. I am wondering, was it that bad at USA back in seventies? LOOOOLBtw, that book reminds me Futorology Congress by Stanislav Lem, that part about huge building built on seven columns, each of those reflects one of major religions. Lack of classical education makes author to create very sophisticated constructs, like five components: things, place, people, people place in socium and information. Author is trying to analyze everything by applying these five to it, but even failed to structurize his own book within these limitations. But, somehow he is right, life is getting faster, and, not everybody like that. Very noticeable part of that book is a way how author uses and interprets statistical data, very biased -izmish way, but, looks like it is quite common, especially in modern society.The best part of this book is it's name Future Shock, which was derived from Culture Shock, and I found it very lyrical :)Would not say that i like that book at all."

It was a surreal experience reading this - nothing felt shocking and nothing jarred... and then I would remember that he wrote this 47 years ago. For the most part, it is an extraordinary portrayal of the then-future/now-present and the challenges of transience, diversity, novelty and pace that he foresaw in 1970 have come home to roost: the cracks in democratic process, the opportunity for conscious evolution through gene technologies, the ever-increasing weight borne by our social services and education systems to look far enough ahead in order to create infrastructures that will be fit for future purpose.Toffler refers to Future Shock as his diagnosis, claiming ""we cannot begin to help ourselves until we become sensitively conscious of the problem."" He does offer a few solutions in Part 6: Strategies for Survival but these lack the detail and depth of the other five sections of the book. It's a thought-provoking read when you consider his foresight and wonder who today will portray our future 50 years out with similar prescience."

As I came across it on a bookshelf, even if in French, I started reading it asap.And I wasn't disappointed: first, the translation is absolutely perfect - hats off! Secondly, I kept wondering along each chapter why the analysis of the society back in the 70s could still apply half a century later... The main trends around the acceleration of change for all aspects in life (technological, (inter)personal, professional, etc.) are still so valid today that this is almost frightening...What did happen in the meantime?? Didn't the 80s also bring many societal changes? Or the Internet revolution in the late 90s? How come do we have the feeling that changes are still accelerating - and that most of the ""solutions"" proposed in the book could still apply today?This is a book I enjoyed reading, not to finger-point where the author didn't foresee something, but to reflect my own current situation and try to anticipate better the future shock :)"

It was way better than the last nonfiction book I read that was published in 2019.But he kind of lost me towards the end. He fails to predict the internet so he suggests “social assemblies” where everyone participates in decision making. And it’s like nobody has time for that! He doesn’t have a lot of faith in the system, and thinks we need to have all these meetings to predict the future. But if everyone was working to the future we would advance faster. He predicts that we will all be cyborgs in the future, writing in 1970. Then just sort of mentions computers and goes on. But it turns out it is really difficult to engineer medical devices.He does get sex robots right though. Apparently sex robots have been in the making for hundreds of years. Yes, men invented sex dolls as soon as they could. Also he suggests that in addition to History we could have a Future class, which is a good idea."

People keep on chanting ""change"" & ""being agile or you will perish"" kind of stuff. It sounds vague as their arguments remain unidimensional. Future Shock is able to cover all the aspects of humanity undergoing the roller coaster of alterations. It is so fun to read a reader can relate his life, the transition he witnessed around him from childhood to present. The part where my eyes got big was our future. The writer took today's practice and predicted our coming time. It was so convincing as if you are actually a part of it. Sometime readers may feel if the content is getting repeated but patience is the key because every chapter is completely new dimension relating other things. This book will you give extreme clarity about what is currently happening around & how to deal with it. I am literally forcing my close one to read this book and looking forward to reading other books of Alvin Toffler."

Half of it could have been cut with none of the content or ideas missing.It wasn't an important part of the book for me, but most of the future predictions were way off the mark - all predictions of the future seem to be far too optimistic in regards to dates. I sometimes wonder if this is something that's done on purpose, especially when selling a book. If you read a book in 1970 and it's predicting things for 2070 when you'll be long dead, you probably won't care as much as if they were predictions for the year 2000, when you'd be alive. I was impressed by his nearly perfect prediction of the Alexa device. I also liked his views on ""overchoice"" and what an issue that would become. I primarily read this to learn a bit more about the issues that can arise when society goes through rapid changes, like we are now, but I wouldn't say I gained a huge amount of insight. To sum the book up, extreme change can trigger lots of negative bodily reactions and it can affect a person's ability to act rationally."
119,0553101501,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10955515-neeraj,4,"In Future Shock, Toffler takes an incredibly fascinating look at the changes reverberating through super-industrial societies such as the U.S. and U.K. in the last 1960s and early 1970s. Toffler's decision to analyze then-current events and trends (e.g., countercultural movements and overconsumption of environmental resources) to predict what could happen in super-industrial societies in the next few decades proves insightful. Though Future Shock certainly drags at parts and some parts devolve into strange science fiction fantasies (underwater civilizations? cyborgs?), his analysis is remarkably prescient. I particularly enjoyed when Toffler predicted political and technological developments that we see today, such as the rise of an ideologue urging us to return to the ""glory days"" (Trump, anyone?) and the production of self-expression media, such as podcasts and online video. Future Shock isn't exactly a beach read, but it was well worth the time and effort I put into it. 9/10 stars."

It's amazing how a lot of the concerns and ideas are still relevant today. This is a quick read, however, I have too much read, so have been taking my time. Heavily influenced by Buckminster Fuller, and Toffler does seem to repeat himself often with out saying much in certain subparts of his chapters, but when he comes up with an idea, it strikes. What is wonderful is paging through his bibliography and finding other similar authors and theorists of the era (mid to late 60s) to read or add to the book shelf"
121,0553101501,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17486478-aziff,4,"It has been almost forty years since it was first published and A. Toffler's fine work continues to amaze and surprise me with its accurate predictions. Future Shock, ahead of its time, explores the human socio-economic and psychological understanding and applies it to maximum effect. That at this point, upon reading sentence upon logical sentence, everything could only be nodded and agreed at. Perhaps not all arguments flexed in this book may be fully accurate, but for a book published way back then when these concepts were close to foreign - It makes reading it a delight and would definitely send shivers down your spine."
122,0553101501,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7070820-ania,4,"A really interesting book written in the 1960s and published in 1970. I can't help but feel that the moon landing of 1969 somehow inspired this book.I really enjoyed this work, even if it was a bit depressing. In a nutshell what this book says is that we can expect from the future a more modular, segmented life, this includes personal lives as well. I've only taken off one star because I feel some of the adaptation strategies towards the future may be kind of lacking, but for a tough book judge like myself 4 stars is a very high rating, therefore I recommend this book if you're on the fence about reading it."

I'm sure you have read this before in reviews, but this is an exceptional book. Though it lacks suspense, romance, and those other aspects we are so fond of it fiction work this book takes up the slack with its insightful facts of cultural change. This book, as well as the title, which became a household phrase, is more profound now than in the late sixties. I must read for every human being especially those that pride themselves on there social progressive views toward the advancement of human kind and the planet we inhabit. "

Maybe a revised more contemporary version would be great. Alvin Toffler was certainly unique in his time and visionary. I might reread it or listen to audio version of the book itself. I borrowed this book from a university library upon a recommendation of a previous colleague of mine. I know that English is a second language for me but I reckon the language of the book would feel the same to a millenial natove English speaker."
125,0553101501,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2280809-wilte,3,"Future shock is the stress and disorientation caused by too much change in too short a time. Written 45 years ago, this concept is still very relevant, maye be even more relevant than in 1970. Book contains interesting concepts and is only occasionaly far of the mark with futuristic predictions.I also liked the concept of adhocracy that will replace bureaucracy; increases adaptability of organizations (I suppose current term would be 'agile') but strains adaptibility of men."

My father recognized having read it decades ago, sniffed out the proceeding 2 books for me to read. I'm not usually prone to pay attention to Futurists but Toffler has a solid of grasp on reality. Never fell off into praising the second coming in the form of a technilogical singularity"
128,0553101501,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34766635-rogerio,5,This book is fantastic. It is hard to believe that Alvin Toffler wrote it in 1970. His analysis of society then and his inferences about the future are so accurate. Not everything developed in the direction he predicted. Nevertheless this book remains a must read. He is brilliant.
129,0553101501,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5105188-lee-barry,4,"As fascinating it is in its prescience, it can also be a bit boring, because alas we're still in the same place almost 50 years later, as if 1970 was critical mass for modernity. It's one of those mixed-rating books (4/2) averaging out to 3. Still a must read because so much of it is still true."

132,0553101501,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13459886-yhc,2,"In my previous book Present Shock: When Everything Happens Now that i enjoyed a lot, it mentioned about this very famous book, future shock and i have it with me for long but never got the chance to read it(also all his other books that i will surely read over ). This book was published in 1970, almost 5 decades ago, therefore i read it as a sci-fi futurist book with the touch of Utopian style. Considering it has been almost 50 years old, Toffler got pretty precise prediction on most of the things he predicted in the book, but what i want to mentioned here is the one he failed to predicted and the reality was rather disappointing. Most of his predictions are around society, education, population change, science development, human relationship, companies...etc.1. He didn't mention anything about globalization, I think at that time this is still pretty new. We feel the commerce is going to develop over continents but globally in the way we are today is indeed fast.2. He didn't mention about banking system would actually became such fatal role to control this planet, the repeated financial crisis doesn't teach us to learn lessons.3. The political development was rarely mentioned, he mentioned about socialist democracy but not capitalized communism...who would know that the biggest politically communism, China, embrace capitalism economically so well now.4. During the cold war, Soviet and USA had space race so we sent people to space and to the moon. In this book, Toffler mentioned many times about space development would reach certain level that we will have so ""many"" astronomers actually live in ISS. (heartache!) Who would know that 50 years later, our astronomers only stay on earth orbit, and never set their foot back to the moon. Luckily we have a big dreams soon with SpaceX to go beyond the moon. Let's pack soon to Mars. Am I allowed to dream big before i get old?5. In Toffler's farest dream, he would never know that one day, the war between 2 countries could be like Virtual Reality games. One side with real casualties, the other would remotely control the drone through screen in another side of the earth, after the mission is done, this few people military still can go back home having dinner with their family. (mentioned in my last book Present Shock: When Everything Happens Now ) 6. Far from training dolphins to be our deep sea exploring partners, we exploit their home, pollute their space into continental size of plastic island. Well done Humans! And of course, we hunt dolphins ,whales, and many other kinds of sea animals with big corporation ship that spare-nothing-kind-of-fishing Nets. (wonder why they don't use their super Nets to clean up the plastic island shit instead)7. Genetically modified on Wild animals to be more docile? Why? Toffler? I thought most of them are killed by humans, docile or not, we just invade their home for the sake of humans!8. 24 hours day light thanks to big mirror reflect from space with satellites to light up the dark side of earth. Toffler mentioned about day light needed in winter time of Scandinavia, which is understandable. for plants to grow, yes. But if for the sake of industry 24 hours function, so human also taking shift to keep working. No way.....give this poor ear a break! we have enough stuff that we don't really need but fabricated. I think this book still have many things for us to actually take into consideration, but like i say, the power is in the hands of big corporations, they don't care about what skin colors we are, what political situation you believe, they just want money!! and Money craving is good enough to destroy this world, and that is the biggest shock!"
133,0553101501,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63892286-sheryl-mccoy,5,"It's difficult to rate ""Future Shock"" highly when reading it is like watching the destruction of civilization in slow motion. Yet, the book is a great read...if you think it's science fiction. These events laid out in this book were not BOUND TO HAPPEN, they were FORCED TO HAPPEN, much like the Shadow Wars in Babylon 5. It wasn't destiny, so much as brain-washing, that makes this future a real possibility.""Future Shock"" is one of the first books to lay out how the unscrupulous would use what we now call ""persuasive technology"" to ensure the rise of a corporate feudal system. from the golden age of corporate capitalism where criminal elements within the Nixon government and corporations began to be recognized as NORMAL. If you didn't realize this, you better go back and read ""Future Shock"" and the companion books again. Most people read Toffler's books and see themselves as the ONE who will rise above the dross. Don't be fooled. This book, Future Shock, is one of a set of cookbooks, including ""The Third Wave"", ""Power Shift"" and others that have been used to ""cook up"" a dismal future for most humans. If you aren't IN THE GROUP MAKING THIS HAPPEN, you aren't in...you are among the dross.At one time, I thought Toffler would find people to put on the brakes to this change in worldview, but that never happened. Let me remind you that NONE OF US who use and rely on public online spaces will be in the upper or even midling echelons of future/present/past feudal leaders. Some politicians like Newt Gingrich and others helped Toffler create this new world through the various laws and groups who control the ""confused"" majority. It's highly unlikely that those of us who saw it all along will make much of a dent in stopping it. When I read Future Shock, I was also reading a great many other books which aligned with the future or aligned with this book in science fiction. It took me a decade before I figured out that this man was laying out A REAL PLAN to put most of us (the 99%) into a state of modern servitude where governments and constitutions of the 2oth century have fallen. The independent person had fallen. There is no fiction here. Think of this plan as an explanation of how Huxley's ""Brave New World"" could come into existence.It seems to me that Toffler's writing style was very engaging, yet alarming in the way he spoke of a return to a recognizable feudal state. A CORPORATE feudal state was described and honored by Toffler. I remember wondering if this could be resisted. I learned that it could not. From the late 1980's until Toffler's death, I watched as he wrote less for a public audience and more for a nouveau feudal ruling class. He and his wife gave conferences and developed relationships with ""leaders"" to maximize ways to create the new corporate feudal system. It seemed to me that he and his wife were glad to be plugged into the process of turning the majority of humans into corporate serfs. I remember one part of his first book included warnings that you would not be able to resist. If you did resist, you would be completely locked out of the corporate-based feudal world. This meant that personal ownership outside the corporate feudal systems would eventually disappear, unless you had some value to the overlords. Take these books for what you will. If you're confused, don't worry...you are just where Toffler and his minions knew you would be."
134,0553101501,http://goodreads.com/user/show/98347967-john,5,"2020 marks 50 years since Future Shock was first published. As a book about the future and how to adapt to its inevitable change it was an interesting time to read it. Due to the fact that I am 50 years removed from the world in which it was written in I am given a very different mindset to read it in. My enjoyment of the book comes partially from looking back with 2020 hindsight and partially from finding its original message still relevant today. The introductory chapters of this book explain just how fast our society started moving in the 20th century. Compared to today this rate of advancement has only increased in acceleration. 1970 marks one of the earliest generations to notice how fast information moves and how quick things can change. I can only imagine how intense this period must have been as no other period of human history progress at the pace of the first 70 years of the 20th century, at that point.A lot of the first half of the book discusses many of the trends of 1970. Toffler projects how changes that happened in the prior half of the 20th century will affect the years after. It was great to see what was seen as revolutionary or points of interest to a person of this time. As someone who finds the 20th century to be one of the most interesting points of history to study, a lot of this book was a pleasure to read. There is a wide variety of subjects covered in this book. Because of this some chapters might interest certain readers more than others. By covering all of these trends the book can feel like it is part history, sociology, philosophy, anthropology, futurist, and business. As a business school graduate some of the chapters on consumer trends were great insight into marketing knowledge of the day, even if some of the information is rudimentary today.Toffler makes many speculations about the future and surprisingly a lot of them turn out to have become true. Granted there are a few subjects he misses on but they are still fun to read about, they just feel more sci-fi than realistic.The overall message of Future Shock is to address the trend of rapid change that forces human beings obsolete if they don't know how to adapt with the changes and learn current information. He offers so many great insights and the fact that they are still relevant really shows how this book is still useful to read today. That being said, reading this 50 years on and realizing not that much has changed is a depressing thought. If more people had read this book back then and incorporated its message into their lives maybe we'd have solve more of societies issues. Its also ironic that many of the people who would have been youth at the point of publishing this book are now the elder, ruling class, failing to adapt to our current world, holding us back. Maybe this is just part of the human condition and it is inevitable that we will fail future generations.Overall I would recommend anyone looking for insight into life during 1970 as well as a better way of looking at the future to read this book. It is well worth it."
135,0553101501,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20926327-lora-shouse,4,"When I was in college Future Shock was all over the shelves at the bookstore and everywhere. Obviously, I should have read it then. A least I could have added it to my book list; I hadn’t closed the first list at that time. But honestly, I don’t know when I would have had the time to read it. And anyway, there were other things I was more interested in at the time.When I was putting books on my second list years later, it occurred to me that I hadn’t ever read Future Shock, and, somewhat surprised that it was still around, I added it to the list at that time. So, now I have finally read it.The first three-quarters of the book or so are pretty fun. Toffler surveys some of the rapidly multiplying different ways of living that were coming into being or looked about to be coming into being and looks at the consequences of too much (or too little) change at one time. At close to fifty years later, I can say that much of what he predicted has in fact happened. I can’t vouch for every little thing he talked about, but he was right on the money about a lot of things like corporate mindset and changes in work – I have lived through a lot of exactly what he was talking about.I’m not sure the pace of change ever got to quite what he expected it to. It was, and still is, plenty fast, mind you, and for those people living on the cutting edge of change all the time I’m sure plenty have and still do experience the negative effects he pointed out. Maybe the increase in the rate of change finally got to a point where it could not keep continuing. Maybe factors such as the environmental movement began to act as kind of a drag on the pace of some kinds of changes. Maybe a large proportion of the population was just not able to change that fast. Anyway, I don’t think that the rate of change ever got quite as out-of-hand as he thought it might. At least not yet.The last quarter of the book, where he talks about what we can do to buffer ourselves against the worst of future shock is a little more boring. A lot of this is suggestions for suggestions. Some of it has been tried, at least on a limited basis. Occasionally cities will get together a planning group to try to plan out some aspects of their future – like what to do about transportation or jobs or living space. But I don’t think this has ever been done very extensively on a national or global level, or very often even on a more local level. And I’m not sure anybody knows how to educate children for a future that we don’t even know what it is yet.This was a library book."
136,0553101501,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12083674-michael-david,5,"When this book was written during the 1970s, the world was at the brink of a technological big bang. Alvin Toffler noticed the signs. He wrote about the signs and elaborated upon them in this book, Future Shock. 'Future shock' was the term he coined for the disease that would afflict unprepared individuals in the future. If I can describe the book in one word, it would be comprehensive. His treatise is full of corroborative references: in fact, 80 pages of the book are all his references. Notable among his points is that more knowledge has been accrued in the past fifty years than in the time between the 15th and 19th century. Among the important points in his treatise is the idea of transience pervading over our everyday lives. Everything is transient - not only things and places, but more importantly, even knowledge and people.In addition, the future also brings with it much novelty and an infinity of choices. Through numerous examples, Toffler claims that it is the lack of rootedness and the difficulty of choice that drives a lot of people towards a breakdown. Given what I perceive nowadays, it's impressive that Toffler was generally right. He had accurately predicted the irascibility of humans at this day and age: millennials nowadays have girlfriends or boyfriends as young as the age of ten; teenage pregnancies are becoming more and more common, and the lack of stability and rootedness within the family and society has fragmented less robust families. One shortcoming from Toffler's book was his inability to predict the repercussions of the personal computer. Because he was unable to predict the advent of the PC through the efforts of pioneers like Wozniak, Gates, and Jobs, he, in effect was conservative in his estimates. The personal computer drastically optimized the speed of new technologies entering our society and culture. The increased speed in computation transformed society, both positively and negatively: while we have information and knowledge at our fingertips, with ease of access, we also have developmentally delayed four-year old children whose tablets have become substitutes for creativity. Well, I guess Toffler was right all along: future shock has arrived. "
137,0553101501,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4872710-eric-swanson,3,"Was a crystal ball for society and technology.Alvin's insights in this book included many accurate predictions for how society would engage and embrace technology in the past future. The book is an easy read with points that continue to have some resonance.Have you ever felt that change was coming too fast and frequently? This is a core tenant of Future Shock, written in a time when computer technology was new, adapting, and accelerating; where technology innovation continues presently. Alvin suggests that society and individuals must be willing to adapt as crucial criteria for success. He highlights that organizations and the world itself will adopt more fluid, shifting structures and interactions based on enabling technology. The internet as well as personal devices today are perfect examples for the fluid nature of how our social, professional and personal interactions with technology are tightly intertwined. However, he warns of the importance in striking a balance between real-world ""actual"" interactions and virtual ""vicarious"" experiences. We have all seen negative effects of technology and social engagement in our lives and communities that usually stem from assumptions that our digital or ""virtual"" experiences are not the same as in real life, leading to communications and actions that would otherwise never occur. He goes further to suggest that we must identify and develop personal ""stability zones"" that nurture our personal connections to one another or risk getting lost along the way, such as maintaining a healthy diet, exercise and leisure with strong, intimate relationships.Alvin successfully predicts that success supported by technology would necessitate invention simply to remain competitive while also emphasizing the important role of collaborative governance among businesses and governments as new technology is developed and introduced. He also correctly forecasts product variety and consumer choice as a result of all of this technology creation."
138,0553101501,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4876036-mitch-anderson,3,"Ignore the year of publication and rest assured — you’re sure to learn something of interest from Alvin Toffler’s Future Shock. Outside of a few dated terms, much of what Toffler speaks to — the social, economic, political, and technological trends of the past, present and future — are addressed through their functional and affective aspects rather than broad speculation over the physical forms and precise implementations to which they are to take. For a book written in 1970, there’s still plenty of relevant information in here to think about.Toffler begins by giving us a broad overview of the state of contemporary society as it stood just as the USA’s golden age was coming to a close. Much of the initial chapters provide overviews of the sociological and psychosocial viewpoints of an uprooted and hyperactive tech-enabled “technosociety” (one of a few dated terms). Touching on the subjects of alienation, grounding, values and belief systems, a la carte lifestyles, political representation and knowledge, Toffler leaves no stone unturned as he exposes to us to the stark realities of the social dysfunction already well underway at the time of publication. Though it paints a rather bleak image of the future, much of what he speaks to remains entirely relevant today.Following the bleak evaluation of the foreseeable future insofar as he sees it, Toffler then speaks to the positive benefits and revelations that change is capable of producing. His case for the essential nature of change is well put though, at best, merely levels the scale between the pros and cons of our collective future.The final bit Toffler falls to a slightly more speculative but entirely theoretical tone in which he discusses some of his own potential solutions to mitigating the worst case social scenarios first presented and to the essential tasks he deemed necessary for our successful, albeit inevitable, march forward in time."
139,0553101501,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22452050-john,4,"3.5/5 — Shocking how many areas Toffler got right about the future. For a solid 75% of the book it’s easy to forget this was published 50 years ago, and then that other 25% makes you appreciate just how uncertain the year 2020 must have been. The most surprising result of reading this was this sense I developed that the world hasn’t really change that much. Sure, we’re technologically more advanced, and we’ve made fairly remarkable progress socially, but many of our stresses are the same. These paragraphs feel like that could have been published this week in a major news outlet:————Great cities are paralyzed by strikes, power failures, riots. International power alliances are shaken. Financial and political leaders secretly tremble--not out of fear that communist (or capitalist) revolutionaries will oust them, but that the entire system is somehow flying out of control.These are indisputable signs of a sick social structure, a society that can no longer perform even its most basic functions in the accustomed ways. It is a society caught in the agony of revolutionary change. In the 1920's and 1930's, communists used to speak of the ""general crisis of capitalism."" It is now clear that they were thinking small. What is occurring now is not a crisis of capitalism, but of industrial society itself, regardless of political form. We are simultaneously experiencing a youth revolution, a sexual revolution, a racial revolution, a colonial revolution, an economic revolution, and the most rapid and deep-going technological revolution in history. We are living through the general crisis of industrialism. In a word, we are in the midst of the super-industrial revolution.—————If the future scares you or excites you...this might be a good book to crack open. Certainly not for everyone though. "

This book influenced my understanding of technology, and helped me better understand the human context of relationships with technology today. Many of the cultural conditions and the relationships with technology in the past, have contributed to and thus can help us better understand our cultural conditions and relationships with technology today. Some of these things from the past that were discussed that I liked most, which help us understand the present:Disposability, consumption culture, and less attachment to specific places and things (we are often relocating for school and work and purchasing cheap new goods rather than repairing expensive existing goods). All of this may contribute to the transience we feel, the psychic pains from which I think we try to avoid through heavy interaction with social media and communication technology with our phones, texts, and emails... which I also think we try to avoid through general stimulation from today's more cheap, accessible modern drugs: video games and pornography.The main point is how the speed of technological change challenges our ability to understand it, process it, and adapt our behavior. Which is why he thinks there should be more attention to how it's shaping our lives in the present and will in the future (more futurists)."

LOOOOLBtw, that book reminds me Futorology Congress by Stanislav Lem, that part about huge building built on seven columns, each of those reflects one of major religions. Lack of classical education makes author to create very sophisticated constructs, like five components: things, place, people, people place in socium and information. Author is trying to analyze everything by applying these five to it, but even failed to structurize his own book within these limitations. But, somehow he is right, life is getting faster, and, not everybody like that. Very noticeable part of that book is a way how author uses and interprets statistical data, very biased -izmish way, but, looks like it is quite common, especially in modern society.The best part of this book is it's name Future Shock, which was derived from Culture Shock, and I found it very lyrical :)Would not say that i like that book at all."

It was a surreal experience reading this - nothing felt shocking and nothing jarred... and then I would remember that he wrote this 47 years ago. For the most part, it is an extraordinary portrayal of the then-future/now-present and the challenges of transience, diversity, novelty and pace that he foresaw in 1970 have come home to roost: the cracks in democratic process, the opportunity for conscious evolution through gene technologies, the ever-increasing weight borne by our social services and education systems to look far enough ahead in order to create infrastructures that will be fit for future purpose.Toffler refers to Future Shock as his diagnosis, claiming ""we cannot begin to help ourselves until we become sensitively conscious of the problem."" He does offer a few solutions in Part 6: Strategies for Survival but these lack the detail and depth of the other five sections of the book. It's a thought-provoking read when you consider his foresight and wonder who today will portray our future 50 years out with similar prescience."

As I came across it on a bookshelf, even if in French, I started reading it asap.And I wasn't disappointed: first, the translation is absolutely perfect - hats off! Secondly, I kept wondering along each chapter why the analysis of the society back in the 70s could still apply half a century later... The main trends around the acceleration of change for all aspects in life (technological, (inter)personal, professional, etc.) are still so valid today that this is almost frightening...What did happen in the meantime?? Didn't the 80s also bring many societal changes? Or the Internet revolution in the late 90s? How come do we have the feeling that changes are still accelerating - and that most of the ""solutions"" proposed in the book could still apply today?This is a book I enjoyed reading, not to finger-point where the author didn't foresee something, but to reflect my own current situation and try to anticipate better the future shock :)"
146,0553101501,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13289226-elizabeth-de-moya,4,"It’s really well written and researched. The author went to Cornell. People don’t appreciate a good education anymore. It was way better than the last nonfiction book I read that was published in 2019.But he kind of lost me towards the end. He fails to predict the internet so he suggests “social assemblies” where everyone participates in decision making. And it’s like nobody has time for that! He doesn’t have a lot of faith in the system, and thinks we need to have all these meetings to predict the future. But if everyone was working to the future we would advance faster. He predicts that we will all be cyborgs in the future, writing in 1970. Then just sort of mentions computers and goes on. But it turns out it is really difficult to engineer medical devices.He does get sex robots right though. Apparently sex robots have been in the making for hundreds of years. Yes, men invented sex dolls as soon as they could. Also he suggests that in addition to History we could have a Future class, which is a good idea."
147,0553101501,http://goodreads.com/user/show/117930191-review-read,5,"https://www.reviewbeforeread.com/2019...I was amazed, this book was written in the 1970s makes so much sense today. People keep on chanting ""change"" & ""being agile or you will perish"" kind of stuff. It sounds vague as their arguments remain unidimensional. Future Shock is able to cover all the aspects of humanity undergoing the roller coaster of alterations. It is so fun to read a reader can relate his life, the transition he witnessed around him from childhood to present. The part where my eyes got big was our future. The writer took today's practice and predicted our coming time. It was so convincing as if you are actually a part of it. Sometime readers may feel if the content is getting repeated but patience is the key because every chapter is completely new dimension relating other things. This book will you give extreme clarity about what is currently happening around & how to deal with it. I am literally forcing my close one to read this book and looking forward to reading other books of Alvin Toffler."
148,0553101501,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5974394-matt,2,"An interesting concept dragged out into an overlong book. Half of it could have been cut with none of the content or ideas missing.It wasn't an important part of the book for me, but most of the future predictions were way off the mark - all predictions of the future seem to be far too optimistic in regards to dates. I sometimes wonder if this is something that's done on purpose, especially when selling a book. If you read a book in 1970 and it's predicting things for 2070 when you'll be long dead, you probably won't care as much as if they were predictions for the year 2000, when you'd be alive. I was impressed by his nearly perfect prediction of the Alexa device. I also liked his views on ""overchoice"" and what an issue that would become. I primarily read this to learn a bit more about the issues that can arise when society goes through rapid changes, like we are now, but I wouldn't say I gained a huge amount of insight. To sum the book up, extreme change can trigger lots of negative bodily reactions and it can affect a person's ability to act rationally."
149,0553101501,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10955515-neeraj,4,"In Future Shock, Toffler takes an incredibly fascinating look at the changes reverberating through super-industrial societies such as the U.S. and U.K. in the last 1960s and early 1970s. Toffler's decision to analyze then-current events and trends (e.g., countercultural movements and overconsumption of environmental resources) to predict what could happen in super-industrial societies in the next few decades proves insightful. Though Future Shock certainly drags at parts and some parts devolve into strange science fiction fantasies (underwater civilizations? cyborgs?), his analysis is remarkably prescient. I particularly enjoyed when Toffler predicted political and technological developments that we see today, such as the rise of an ideologue urging us to return to the ""glory days"" (Trump, anyone?) and the production of self-expression media, such as podcasts and online video. Future Shock isn't exactly a beach read, but it was well worth the time and effort I put into it. 9/10 stars."
150,0553101501,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2970024-john-frederick,4,"It's always fun to go back to the future, and futurist, Alvin Toffler, has offered suggestion and insights that are dead on, or still of concern in forty years from when the book was originally published. It's amazing how a lot of the concerns and ideas are still relevant today. This is a quick read, however, I have too much read, so have been taking my time. Heavily influenced by Buckminster Fuller, and Toffler does seem to repeat himself often with out saying much in certain subparts of his chapters, but when he comes up with an idea, it strikes. What is wonderful is paging through his bibliography and finding other similar authors and theorists of the era (mid to late 60s) to read or add to the book shelf"
151,0553101501,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17486478-aziff,4,"It has been almost forty years since it was first published and A. Toffler's fine work continues to amaze and surprise me with its accurate predictions. Future Shock, ahead of its time, explores the human socio-economic and psychological understanding and applies it to maximum effect. That at this point, upon reading sentence upon logical sentence, everything could only be nodded and agreed at. Perhaps not all arguments flexed in this book may be fully accurate, but for a book published way back then when these concepts were close to foreign - It makes reading it a delight and would definitely send shivers down your spine."
152,0553101501,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7070820-ania,4,"A really interesting book written in the 1960s and published in 1970. I can't help but feel that the moon landing of 1969 somehow inspired this book.I really enjoyed this work, even if it was a bit depressing. In a nutshell what this book says is that we can expect from the future a more modular, segmented life, this includes personal lives as well. I've only taken off one star because I feel some of the adaptation strategies towards the future may be kind of lacking, but for a tough book judge like myself 4 stars is a very high rating, therefore I recommend this book if you're on the fence about reading it."

I'm sure you have read this before in reviews, but this is an exceptional book. Though it lacks suspense, romance, and those other aspects we are so fond of it fiction work this book takes up the slack with its insightful facts of cultural change. This book, as well as the title, which became a household phrase, is more profound now than in the late sixties. I must read for every human being especially those that pride themselves on there social progressive views toward the advancement of human kind and the planet we inhabit. "
154,0553101501,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5951659-mohammed-almahfoudh,3,"Great concept explanation but a lot of repitition amd padding. The language is old, too old and ambiguous at times. Maybe a revised more contemporary version would be great. Alvin Toffler was certainly unique in his time and visionary. I might reread it or listen to audio version of the book itself. I borrowed this book from a university library upon a recommendation of a previous colleague of mine. I know that English is a second language for me but I reckon the language of the book would feel the same to a millenial natove English speaker."
155,0553101501,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2280809-wilte,3,"Future shock is the stress and disorientation caused by too much change in too short a time. Written 45 years ago, this concept is still very relevant, maye be even more relevant than in 1970. Book contains interesting concepts and is only occasionaly far of the mark with futuristic predictions.I also liked the concept of adhocracy that will replace bureaucracy; increases adaptability of organizations (I suppose current term would be 'agile') but strains adaptibility of men."

My father recognized having read it decades ago, sniffed out the proceeding 2 books for me to read. I'm not usually prone to pay attention to Futurists but Toffler has a solid of grasp on reality. Never fell off into praising the second coming in the form of a technilogical singularity"
158,0553101501,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34766635-rogerio,5,This book is fantastic. It is hard to believe that Alvin Toffler wrote it in 1970. His analysis of society then and his inferences about the future are so accurate. Not everything developed in the direction he predicted. Nevertheless this book remains a must read. He is brilliant.
159,0553101501,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5105188-lee-barry,4,"As fascinating it is in its prescience, it can also be a bit boring, because alas we're still in the same place almost 50 years later, as if 1970 was critical mass for modernity. It's one of those mixed-rating books (4/2) averaging out to 3. Still a must read because so much of it is still true."

162,0553101501,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13459886-yhc,2,"In my previous book Present Shock: When Everything Happens Now that i enjoyed a lot, it mentioned about this very famous book, future shock and i have it with me for long but never got the chance to read it(also all his other books that i will surely read over ). This book was published in 1970, almost 5 decades ago, therefore i read it as a sci-fi futurist book with the touch of Utopian style. Considering it has been almost 50 years old, Toffler got pretty precise prediction on most of the things he predicted in the book, but what i want to mentioned here is the one he failed to predicted and the reality was rather disappointing. Most of his predictions are around society, education, population change, science development, human relationship, companies...etc.1. He didn't mention anything about globalization, I think at that time this is still pretty new. We feel the commerce is going to develop over continents but globally in the way we are today is indeed fast.2. He didn't mention about banking system would actually became such fatal role to control this planet, the repeated financial crisis doesn't teach us to learn lessons.3. The political development was rarely mentioned, he mentioned about socialist democracy but not capitalized communism...who would know that the biggest politically communism, China, embrace capitalism economically so well now.4. During the cold war, Soviet and USA had space race so we sent people to space and to the moon. In this book, Toffler mentioned many times about space development would reach certain level that we will have so ""many"" astronomers actually live in ISS. (heartache!) Who would know that 50 years later, our astronomers only stay on earth orbit, and never set their foot back to the moon. Luckily we have a big dreams soon with SpaceX to go beyond the moon. Let's pack soon to Mars. Am I allowed to dream big before i get old?5. In Toffler's farest dream, he would never know that one day, the war between 2 countries could be like Virtual Reality games. One side with real casualties, the other would remotely control the drone through screen in another side of the earth, after the mission is done, this few people military still can go back home having dinner with their family. (mentioned in my last book Present Shock: When Everything Happens Now ) 6. Far from training dolphins to be our deep sea exploring partners, we exploit their home, pollute their space into continental size of plastic island. Well done Humans! And of course, we hunt dolphins ,whales, and many other kinds of sea animals with big corporation ship that spare-nothing-kind-of-fishing Nets. (wonder why they don't use their super Nets to clean up the plastic island shit instead)7. Genetically modified on Wild animals to be more docile? Why? Toffler? I thought most of them are killed by humans, docile or not, we just invade their home for the sake of humans!8. 24 hours day light thanks to big mirror reflect from space with satellites to light up the dark side of earth. Toffler mentioned about day light needed in winter time of Scandinavia, which is understandable. for plants to grow, yes. But if for the sake of industry 24 hours function, so human also taking shift to keep working. No way.....give this poor ear a break! we have enough stuff that we don't really need but fabricated. I think this book still have many things for us to actually take into consideration, but like i say, the power is in the hands of big corporations, they don't care about what skin colors we are, what political situation you believe, they just want money!! and Money craving is good enough to destroy this world, and that is the biggest shock!"
163,0553101501,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63892286-sheryl-mccoy,5,"It's difficult to rate ""Future Shock"" highly when reading it is like watching the destruction of civilization in slow motion. Yet, the book is a great read...if you think it's science fiction. These events laid out in this book were not BOUND TO HAPPEN, they were FORCED TO HAPPEN, much like the Shadow Wars in Babylon 5. It wasn't destiny, so much as brain-washing, that makes this future a real possibility.""Future Shock"" is one of the first books to lay out how the unscrupulous would use what we now call ""persuasive technology"" to ensure the rise of a corporate feudal system. from the golden age of corporate capitalism where criminal elements within the Nixon government and corporations began to be recognized as NORMAL. If you didn't realize this, you better go back and read ""Future Shock"" and the companion books again. Most people read Toffler's books and see themselves as the ONE who will rise above the dross. Don't be fooled. This book, Future Shock, is one of a set of cookbooks, including ""The Third Wave"", ""Power Shift"" and others that have been used to ""cook up"" a dismal future for most humans. If you aren't IN THE GROUP MAKING THIS HAPPEN, you aren't in...you are among the dross.At one time, I thought Toffler would find people to put on the brakes to this change in worldview, but that never happened. Let me remind you that NONE OF US who use and rely on public online spaces will be in the upper or even midling echelons of future/present/past feudal leaders. Some politicians like Newt Gingrich and others helped Toffler create this new world through the various laws and groups who control the ""confused"" majority. It's highly unlikely that those of us who saw it all along will make much of a dent in stopping it. When I read Future Shock, I was also reading a great many other books which aligned with the future or aligned with this book in science fiction. It took me a decade before I figured out that this man was laying out A REAL PLAN to put most of us (the 99%) into a state of modern servitude where governments and constitutions of the 2oth century have fallen. The independent person had fallen. There is no fiction here. Think of this plan as an explanation of how Huxley's ""Brave New World"" could come into existence.It seems to me that Toffler's writing style was very engaging, yet alarming in the way he spoke of a return to a recognizable feudal state. A CORPORATE feudal state was described and honored by Toffler. I remember wondering if this could be resisted. I learned that it could not. From the late 1980's until Toffler's death, I watched as he wrote less for a public audience and more for a nouveau feudal ruling class. He and his wife gave conferences and developed relationships with ""leaders"" to maximize ways to create the new corporate feudal system. It seemed to me that he and his wife were glad to be plugged into the process of turning the majority of humans into corporate serfs. I remember one part of his first book included warnings that you would not be able to resist. If you did resist, you would be completely locked out of the corporate-based feudal world. This meant that personal ownership outside the corporate feudal systems would eventually disappear, unless you had some value to the overlords. Take these books for what you will. If you're confused, don't worry...you are just where Toffler and his minions knew you would be."
164,0553101501,http://goodreads.com/user/show/98347967-john,5,"2020 marks 50 years since Future Shock was first published. As a book about the future and how to adapt to its inevitable change it was an interesting time to read it. Due to the fact that I am 50 years removed from the world in which it was written in I am given a very different mindset to read it in. My enjoyment of the book comes partially from looking back with 2020 hindsight and partially from finding its original message still relevant today. The introductory chapters of this book explain just how fast our society started moving in the 20th century. Compared to today this rate of advancement has only increased in acceleration. 1970 marks one of the earliest generations to notice how fast information moves and how quick things can change. I can only imagine how intense this period must have been as no other period of human history progress at the pace of the first 70 years of the 20th century, at that point.A lot of the first half of the book discusses many of the trends of 1970. Toffler projects how changes that happened in the prior half of the 20th century will affect the years after. It was great to see what was seen as revolutionary or points of interest to a person of this time. As someone who finds the 20th century to be one of the most interesting points of history to study, a lot of this book was a pleasure to read. There is a wide variety of subjects covered in this book. Because of this some chapters might interest certain readers more than others. By covering all of these trends the book can feel like it is part history, sociology, philosophy, anthropology, futurist, and business. As a business school graduate some of the chapters on consumer trends were great insight into marketing knowledge of the day, even if some of the information is rudimentary today.Toffler makes many speculations about the future and surprisingly a lot of them turn out to have become true. Granted there are a few subjects he misses on but they are still fun to read about, they just feel more sci-fi than realistic.The overall message of Future Shock is to address the trend of rapid change that forces human beings obsolete if they don't know how to adapt with the changes and learn current information. He offers so many great insights and the fact that they are still relevant really shows how this book is still useful to read today. That being said, reading this 50 years on and realizing not that much has changed is a depressing thought. If more people had read this book back then and incorporated its message into their lives maybe we'd have solve more of societies issues. Its also ironic that many of the people who would have been youth at the point of publishing this book are now the elder, ruling class, failing to adapt to our current world, holding us back. Maybe this is just part of the human condition and it is inevitable that we will fail future generations.Overall I would recommend anyone looking for insight into life during 1970 as well as a better way of looking at the future to read this book. It is well worth it."
165,0553101501,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20926327-lora-shouse,4,"When I was in college Future Shock was all over the shelves at the bookstore and everywhere. Obviously, I should have read it then. A least I could have added it to my book list; I hadn’t closed the first list at that time. But honestly, I don’t know when I would have had the time to read it. And anyway, there were other things I was more interested in at the time.When I was putting books on my second list years later, it occurred to me that I hadn’t ever read Future Shock, and, somewhat surprised that it was still around, I added it to the list at that time. So, now I have finally read it.The first three-quarters of the book or so are pretty fun. Toffler surveys some of the rapidly multiplying different ways of living that were coming into being or looked about to be coming into being and looks at the consequences of too much (or too little) change at one time. At close to fifty years later, I can say that much of what he predicted has in fact happened. I can’t vouch for every little thing he talked about, but he was right on the money about a lot of things like corporate mindset and changes in work – I have lived through a lot of exactly what he was talking about.I’m not sure the pace of change ever got to quite what he expected it to. It was, and still is, plenty fast, mind you, and for those people living on the cutting edge of change all the time I’m sure plenty have and still do experience the negative effects he pointed out. Maybe the increase in the rate of change finally got to a point where it could not keep continuing. Maybe factors such as the environmental movement began to act as kind of a drag on the pace of some kinds of changes. Maybe a large proportion of the population was just not able to change that fast. Anyway, I don’t think that the rate of change ever got quite as out-of-hand as he thought it might. At least not yet.The last quarter of the book, where he talks about what we can do to buffer ourselves against the worst of future shock is a little more boring. A lot of this is suggestions for suggestions. Some of it has been tried, at least on a limited basis. Occasionally cities will get together a planning group to try to plan out some aspects of their future – like what to do about transportation or jobs or living space. But I don’t think this has ever been done very extensively on a national or global level, or very often even on a more local level. And I’m not sure anybody knows how to educate children for a future that we don’t even know what it is yet.This was a library book."
166,0553101501,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12083674-michael-david,5,"When this book was written during the 1970s, the world was at the brink of a technological big bang. Alvin Toffler noticed the signs. He wrote about the signs and elaborated upon them in this book, Future Shock. 'Future shock' was the term he coined for the disease that would afflict unprepared individuals in the future. If I can describe the book in one word, it would be comprehensive. His treatise is full of corroborative references: in fact, 80 pages of the book are all his references. Notable among his points is that more knowledge has been accrued in the past fifty years than in the time between the 15th and 19th century. Among the important points in his treatise is the idea of transience pervading over our everyday lives. Everything is transient - not only things and places, but more importantly, even knowledge and people.In addition, the future also brings with it much novelty and an infinity of choices. Through numerous examples, Toffler claims that it is the lack of rootedness and the difficulty of choice that drives a lot of people towards a breakdown. Given what I perceive nowadays, it's impressive that Toffler was generally right. He had accurately predicted the irascibility of humans at this day and age: millennials nowadays have girlfriends or boyfriends as young as the age of ten; teenage pregnancies are becoming more and more common, and the lack of stability and rootedness within the family and society has fragmented less robust families. One shortcoming from Toffler's book was his inability to predict the repercussions of the personal computer. Because he was unable to predict the advent of the PC through the efforts of pioneers like Wozniak, Gates, and Jobs, he, in effect was conservative in his estimates. The personal computer drastically optimized the speed of new technologies entering our society and culture. The increased speed in computation transformed society, both positively and negatively: while we have information and knowledge at our fingertips, with ease of access, we also have developmentally delayed four-year old children whose tablets have become substitutes for creativity. Well, I guess Toffler was right all along: future shock has arrived. "
167,0553101501,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4872710-eric-swanson,3,"Was a crystal ball for society and technology.Alvin's insights in this book included many accurate predictions for how society would engage and embrace technology in the past future. The book is an easy read with points that continue to have some resonance.Have you ever felt that change was coming too fast and frequently? This is a core tenant of Future Shock, written in a time when computer technology was new, adapting, and accelerating; where technology innovation continues presently. Alvin suggests that society and individuals must be willing to adapt as crucial criteria for success. He highlights that organizations and the world itself will adopt more fluid, shifting structures and interactions based on enabling technology. The internet as well as personal devices today are perfect examples for the fluid nature of how our social, professional and personal interactions with technology are tightly intertwined. However, he warns of the importance in striking a balance between real-world ""actual"" interactions and virtual ""vicarious"" experiences. We have all seen negative effects of technology and social engagement in our lives and communities that usually stem from assumptions that our digital or ""virtual"" experiences are not the same as in real life, leading to communications and actions that would otherwise never occur. He goes further to suggest that we must identify and develop personal ""stability zones"" that nurture our personal connections to one another or risk getting lost along the way, such as maintaining a healthy diet, exercise and leisure with strong, intimate relationships.Alvin successfully predicts that success supported by technology would necessitate invention simply to remain competitive while also emphasizing the important role of collaborative governance among businesses and governments as new technology is developed and introduced. He also correctly forecasts product variety and consumer choice as a result of all of this technology creation."
168,0553101501,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4876036-mitch-anderson,3,"Ignore the year of publication and rest assured — you’re sure to learn something of interest from Alvin Toffler’s Future Shock. Outside of a few dated terms, much of what Toffler speaks to — the social, economic, political, and technological trends of the past, present and future — are addressed through their functional and affective aspects rather than broad speculation over the physical forms and precise implementations to which they are to take. For a book written in 1970, there’s still plenty of relevant information in here to think about.Toffler begins by giving us a broad overview of the state of contemporary society as it stood just as the USA’s golden age was coming to a close. Much of the initial chapters provide overviews of the sociological and psychosocial viewpoints of an uprooted and hyperactive tech-enabled “technosociety” (one of a few dated terms). Touching on the subjects of alienation, grounding, values and belief systems, a la carte lifestyles, political representation and knowledge, Toffler leaves no stone unturned as he exposes to us to the stark realities of the social dysfunction already well underway at the time of publication. Though it paints a rather bleak image of the future, much of what he speaks to remains entirely relevant today.Following the bleak evaluation of the foreseeable future insofar as he sees it, Toffler then speaks to the positive benefits and revelations that change is capable of producing. His case for the essential nature of change is well put though, at best, merely levels the scale between the pros and cons of our collective future.The final bit Toffler falls to a slightly more speculative but entirely theoretical tone in which he discusses some of his own potential solutions to mitigating the worst case social scenarios first presented and to the essential tasks he deemed necessary for our successful, albeit inevitable, march forward in time."
169,0553101501,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22452050-john,4,"3.5/5 — Shocking how many areas Toffler got right about the future. For a solid 75% of the book it’s easy to forget this was published 50 years ago, and then that other 25% makes you appreciate just how uncertain the year 2020 must have been. The most surprising result of reading this was this sense I developed that the world hasn’t really change that much. Sure, we’re technologically more advanced, and we’ve made fairly remarkable progress socially, but many of our stresses are the same. These paragraphs feel like that could have been published this week in a major news outlet:————Great cities are paralyzed by strikes, power failures, riots. International power alliances are shaken. Financial and political leaders secretly tremble--not out of fear that communist (or capitalist) revolutionaries will oust them, but that the entire system is somehow flying out of control.These are indisputable signs of a sick social structure, a society that can no longer perform even its most basic functions in the accustomed ways. It is a society caught in the agony of revolutionary change. In the 1920's and 1930's, communists used to speak of the ""general crisis of capitalism."" It is now clear that they were thinking small. What is occurring now is not a crisis of capitalism, but of industrial society itself, regardless of political form. We are simultaneously experiencing a youth revolution, a sexual revolution, a racial revolution, a colonial revolution, an economic revolution, and the most rapid and deep-going technological revolution in history. We are living through the general crisis of industrialism. In a word, we are in the midst of the super-industrial revolution.—————If the future scares you or excites you...this might be a good book to crack open. Certainly not for everyone though. "

This book influenced my understanding of technology, and helped me better understand the human context of relationships with technology today. Many of the cultural conditions and the relationships with technology in the past, have contributed to and thus can help us better understand our cultural conditions and relationships with technology today. Some of these things from the past that were discussed that I liked most, which help us understand the present:Disposability, consumption culture, and less attachment to specific places and things (we are often relocating for school and work and purchasing cheap new goods rather than repairing expensive existing goods). All of this may contribute to the transience we feel, the psychic pains from which I think we try to avoid through heavy interaction with social media and communication technology with our phones, texts, and emails... which I also think we try to avoid through general stimulation from today's more cheap, accessible modern drugs: video games and pornography.The main point is how the speed of technological change challenges our ability to understand it, process it, and adapt our behavior. Which is why he thinks there should be more attention to how it's shaping our lives in the present and will in the future (more futurists)."

Today we are fast approaching the day when the body can no longer be regarded as fixed. Man will be able, within a reasonably short period, to redesign not merely individual bodies, but the entire human race.” p.182 “Ultimately, the problems are not scientific or technical, but ethical and political. Choice - and the criteria for choice - will be critical.” p.187 “Despite profound ethical questions about whether they should, the fact remains that scientific curiosity is, itself, one of the most powerful driving forces in our society.” p.189 “Many of us feel instinctive revulsion at the hazards of meddling with the finely balanced and far reaching systems that make an individual what he is. Yet I believe it will surely be done or attempted. The pathway will be built from a combination of altruism, private profit, and ignorance. -Dr. Rollin D.

I found that author is merely affected by sexizm, racizm and many other -izms, noticeable even for my russian origin. I am wondering, was it that bad at USA back in seventies? LOOOOLBtw, that book reminds me Futorology Congress by Stanislav Lem, that part about huge building built on seven columns, each of those reflects one of major religions. Lack of classical education makes author to create very sophisticated constructs, like five components: things, place, people, people place in socium and information. Author is trying to analyze everything by applying these five to it, but even failed to structurize his own book within these limitations. But, somehow he is right, life is getting faster, and, not everybody like that. Very noticeable part of that book is a way how author uses and interprets statistical data, very biased -izmish way, but, looks like it is quite common, especially in modern society.The best part of this book is it's name Future Shock, which was derived from Culture Shock, and I found it very lyrical :)Would not say that i like that book at all."

It was a surreal experience reading this - nothing felt shocking and nothing jarred... and then I would remember that he wrote this 47 years ago. For the most part, it is an extraordinary portrayal of the then-future/now-present and the challenges of transience, diversity, novelty and pace that he foresaw in 1970 have come home to roost: the cracks in democratic process, the opportunity for conscious evolution through gene technologies, the ever-increasing weight borne by our social services and education systems to look far enough ahead in order to create infrastructures that will be fit for future purpose.Toffler refers to Future Shock as his diagnosis, claiming ""we cannot begin to help ourselves until we become sensitively conscious of the problem."" He does offer a few solutions in Part 6: Strategies for Survival but these lack the detail and depth of the other five sections of the book. It's a thought-provoking read when you consider his foresight and wonder who today will portray our future 50 years out with similar prescience."

As I came across it on a bookshelf, even if in French, I started reading it asap.And I wasn't disappointed: first, the translation is absolutely perfect - hats off! Secondly, I kept wondering along each chapter why the analysis of the society back in the 70s could still apply half a century later... The main trends around the acceleration of change for all aspects in life (technological, (inter)personal, professional, etc.) are still so valid today that this is almost frightening...What did happen in the meantime?? Didn't the 80s also bring many societal changes? Or the Internet revolution in the late 90s? How come do we have the feeling that changes are still accelerating - and that most of the ""solutions"" proposed in the book could still apply today?This is a book I enjoyed reading, not to finger-point where the author didn't foresee something, but to reflect my own current situation and try to anticipate better the future shock :)"

It was way better than the last nonfiction book I read that was published in 2019.But he kind of lost me towards the end. He fails to predict the internet so he suggests “social assemblies” where everyone participates in decision making. And it’s like nobody has time for that! He doesn’t have a lot of faith in the system, and thinks we need to have all these meetings to predict the future. But if everyone was working to the future we would advance faster. He predicts that we will all be cyborgs in the future, writing in 1970. Then just sort of mentions computers and goes on. But it turns out it is really difficult to engineer medical devices.He does get sex robots right though. Apparently sex robots have been in the making for hundreds of years. Yes, men invented sex dolls as soon as they could. Also he suggests that in addition to History we could have a Future class, which is a good idea."

People keep on chanting ""change"" & ""being agile or you will perish"" kind of stuff. It sounds vague as their arguments remain unidimensional. Future Shock is able to cover all the aspects of humanity undergoing the roller coaster of alterations. It is so fun to read a reader can relate his life, the transition he witnessed around him from childhood to present. The part where my eyes got big was our future. The writer took today's practice and predicted our coming time. It was so convincing as if you are actually a part of it. Sometime readers may feel if the content is getting repeated but patience is the key because every chapter is completely new dimension relating other things. This book will you give extreme clarity about what is currently happening around & how to deal with it. I am literally forcing my close one to read this book and looking forward to reading other books of Alvin Toffler."
178,0553101501,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5974394-matt,2,"An interesting concept dragged out into an overlong book. Half of it could have been cut with none of the content or ideas missing.It wasn't an important part of the book for me, but most of the future predictions were way off the mark - all predictions of the future seem to be far too optimistic in regards to dates. I sometimes wonder if this is something that's done on purpose, especially when selling a book. If you read a book in 1970 and it's predicting things for 2070 when you'll be long dead, you probably won't care as much as if they were predictions for the year 2000, when you'd be alive. I was impressed by his nearly perfect prediction of the Alexa device. I also liked his views on ""overchoice"" and what an issue that would become. I primarily read this to learn a bit more about the issues that can arise when society goes through rapid changes, like we are now, but I wouldn't say I gained a huge amount of insight. To sum the book up, extreme change can trigger lots of negative bodily reactions and it can affect a person's ability to act rationally."
179,0553101501,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10955515-neeraj,4,"In Future Shock, Toffler takes an incredibly fascinating look at the changes reverberating through super-industrial societies such as the U.S. and U.K. in the last 1960s and early 1970s. Toffler's decision to analyze then-current events and trends (e.g., countercultural movements and overconsumption of environmental resources) to predict what could happen in super-industrial societies in the next few decades proves insightful. Though Future Shock certainly drags at parts and some parts devolve into strange science fiction fantasies (underwater civilizations? cyborgs?), his analysis is remarkably prescient. I particularly enjoyed when Toffler predicted political and technological developments that we see today, such as the rise of an ideologue urging us to return to the ""glory days"" (Trump, anyone?) and the production of self-expression media, such as podcasts and online video. Future Shock isn't exactly a beach read, but it was well worth the time and effort I put into it. 9/10 stars."

It's amazing how a lot of the concerns and ideas are still relevant today. This is a quick read, however, I have too much read, so have been taking my time. Heavily influenced by Buckminster Fuller, and Toffler does seem to repeat himself often with out saying much in certain subparts of his chapters, but when he comes up with an idea, it strikes. What is wonderful is paging through his bibliography and finding other similar authors and theorists of the era (mid to late 60s) to read or add to the book shelf"

Toffler's fine work continues to amaze and surprise me with its accurate predictions. Future Shock, ahead of its time, explores the human socio-economic and psychological understanding and applies it to maximum effect. That at this point, upon reading sentence upon logical sentence, everything could only be nodded and agreed at. Perhaps not all arguments flexed in this book may be fully accurate, but for a book published way back then when these concepts were close to foreign - It makes reading it a delight and would definitely send shivers down your spine."

I can't help but feel that the moon landing of 1969 somehow inspired this book.I really enjoyed this work, even if it was a bit depressing. In a nutshell what this book says is that we can expect from the future a more modular, segmented life, this includes personal lives as well. I've only taken off one star because I feel some of the adaptation strategies towards the future may be kind of lacking, but for a tough book judge like myself 4 stars is a very high rating, therefore I recommend this book if you're on the fence about reading it."

This book, as well as the title, which became a household phrase, is more profound now than in the late sixties.

I borrowed this book from a university library upon a recommendation of a previous colleague of mine.

Written 45 years ago, this concept is still very relevant, maye be even more relevant than in 1970. Book contains interesting concepts and is only occasionaly far of the mark with futuristic predictions.I also liked the concept of adhocracy that will replace bureaucracy; increases adaptability of organizations (I suppose current term would be 'agile') but strains adaptibility of men."

192,0553101501,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13459886-yhc,2,"In my previous book Present Shock: When Everything Happens Now that i enjoyed a lot, it mentioned about this very famous book, future shock and i have it with me for long but never got the chance to read it(also all his other books that i will surely read over ). This book was published in 1970, almost 5 decades ago, therefore i read it as a sci-fi futurist book with the touch of Utopian style. Considering it has been almost 50 years old, Toffler got pretty precise prediction on most of the things he predicted in the book, but what i want to mentioned here is the one he failed to predicted and the reality was rather disappointing. Most of his predictions are around society, education, population change, science development, human relationship, companies...etc.1. He didn't mention anything about globalization, I think at that time this is still pretty new. We feel the commerce is going to develop over continents but globally in the way we are today is indeed fast.2. He didn't mention about banking system would actually became such fatal role to control this planet, the repeated financial crisis doesn't teach us to learn lessons.3. The political development was rarely mentioned, he mentioned about socialist democracy but not capitalized communism...who would know that the biggest politically communism, China, embrace capitalism economically so well now.4. During the cold war, Soviet and USA had space race so we sent people to space and to the moon. In this book, Toffler mentioned many times about space development would reach certain level that we will have so ""many"" astronomers actually live in ISS. (heartache!) Who would know that 50 years later, our astronomers only stay on earth orbit, and never set their foot back to the moon. Luckily we have a big dreams soon with SpaceX to go beyond the moon. Let's pack soon to Mars. Am I allowed to dream big before i get old?5. In Toffler's farest dream, he would never know that one day, the war between 2 countries could be like Virtual Reality games. One side with real casualties, the other would remotely control the drone through screen in another side of the earth, after the mission is done, this few people military still can go back home having dinner with their family. (mentioned in my last book Present Shock: When Everything Happens Now ) 6. Far from training dolphins to be our deep sea exploring partners, we exploit their home, pollute their space into continental size of plastic island. Well done Humans! And of course, we hunt dolphins ,whales, and many other kinds of sea animals with big corporation ship that spare-nothing-kind-of-fishing Nets. (wonder why they don't use their super Nets to clean up the plastic island shit instead)7. Genetically modified on Wild animals to be more docile? Why? Toffler? I thought most of them are killed by humans, docile or not, we just invade their home for the sake of humans!8. 24 hours day light thanks to big mirror reflect from space with satellites to light up the dark side of earth. Toffler mentioned about day light needed in winter time of Scandinavia, which is understandable. for plants to grow, yes. But if for the sake of industry 24 hours function, so human also taking shift to keep working. No way.....give this poor ear a break! we have enough stuff that we don't really need but fabricated. I think this book still have many things for us to actually take into consideration, but like i say, the power is in the hands of big corporations, they don't care about what skin colors we are, what political situation you believe, they just want money!! and Money craving is good enough to destroy this world, and that is the biggest shock!"
193,0553101501,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63892286-sheryl-mccoy,5,"It's difficult to rate ""Future Shock"" highly when reading it is like watching the destruction of civilization in slow motion. Yet, the book is a great read...if you think it's science fiction. These events laid out in this book were not BOUND TO HAPPEN, they were FORCED TO HAPPEN, much like the Shadow Wars in Babylon 5. It wasn't destiny, so much as brain-washing, that makes this future a real possibility.""Future Shock"" is one of the first books to lay out how the unscrupulous would use what we now call ""persuasive technology"" to ensure the rise of a corporate feudal system. from the golden age of corporate capitalism where criminal elements within the Nixon government and corporations began to be recognized as NORMAL. If you didn't realize this, you better go back and read ""Future Shock"" and the companion books again. Most people read Toffler's books and see themselves as the ONE who will rise above the dross. Don't be fooled. This book, Future Shock, is one of a set of cookbooks, including ""The Third Wave"", ""Power Shift"" and others that have been used to ""cook up"" a dismal future for most humans. If you aren't IN THE GROUP MAKING THIS HAPPEN, you aren't in...you are among the dross.At one time, I thought Toffler would find people to put on the brakes to this change in worldview, but that never happened. Let me remind you that NONE OF US who use and rely on public online spaces will be in the upper or even midling echelons of future/present/past feudal leaders. Some politicians like Newt Gingrich and others helped Toffler create this new world through the various laws and groups who control the ""confused"" majority. It's highly unlikely that those of us who saw it all along will make much of a dent in stopping it. When I read Future Shock, I was also reading a great many other books which aligned with the future or aligned with this book in science fiction. It took me a decade before I figured out that this man was laying out A REAL PLAN to put most of us (the 99%) into a state of modern servitude where governments and constitutions of the 2oth century have fallen. The independent person had fallen. There is no fiction here. Think of this plan as an explanation of how Huxley's ""Brave New World"" could come into existence.It seems to me that Toffler's writing style was very engaging, yet alarming in the way he spoke of a return to a recognizable feudal state. A CORPORATE feudal state was described and honored by Toffler. I remember wondering if this could be resisted. I learned that it could not. From the late 1980's until Toffler's death, I watched as he wrote less for a public audience and more for a nouveau feudal ruling class. He and his wife gave conferences and developed relationships with ""leaders"" to maximize ways to create the new corporate feudal system. It seemed to me that he and his wife were glad to be plugged into the process of turning the majority of humans into corporate serfs. I remember one part of his first book included warnings that you would not be able to resist. If you did resist, you would be completely locked out of the corporate-based feudal world. This meant that personal ownership outside the corporate feudal systems would eventually disappear, unless you had some value to the overlords. Take these books for what you will. If you're confused, don't worry...you are just where Toffler and his minions knew you would be."
194,0553101501,http://goodreads.com/user/show/98347967-john,5,"2020 marks 50 years since Future Shock was first published. As a book about the future and how to adapt to its inevitable change it was an interesting time to read it. Due to the fact that I am 50 years removed from the world in which it was written in I am given a very different mindset to read it in. My enjoyment of the book comes partially from looking back with 2020 hindsight and partially from finding its original message still relevant today. The introductory chapters of this book explain just how fast our society started moving in the 20th century. Compared to today this rate of advancement has only increased in acceleration. 1970 marks one of the earliest generations to notice how fast information moves and how quick things can change. I can only imagine how intense this period must have been as no other period of human history progress at the pace of the first 70 years of the 20th century, at that point.A lot of the first half of the book discusses many of the trends of 1970. Toffler projects how changes that happened in the prior half of the 20th century will affect the years after. It was great to see what was seen as revolutionary or points of interest to a person of this time. As someone who finds the 20th century to be one of the most interesting points of history to study, a lot of this book was a pleasure to read. There is a wide variety of subjects covered in this book. Because of this some chapters might interest certain readers more than others. By covering all of these trends the book can feel like it is part history, sociology, philosophy, anthropology, futurist, and business. As a business school graduate some of the chapters on consumer trends were great insight into marketing knowledge of the day, even if some of the information is rudimentary today.Toffler makes many speculations about the future and surprisingly a lot of them turn out to have become true. Granted there are a few subjects he misses on but they are still fun to read about, they just feel more sci-fi than realistic.The overall message of Future Shock is to address the trend of rapid change that forces human beings obsolete if they don't know how to adapt with the changes and learn current information. He offers so many great insights and the fact that they are still relevant really shows how this book is still useful to read today. That being said, reading this 50 years on and realizing not that much has changed is a depressing thought. If more people had read this book back then and incorporated its message into their lives maybe we'd have solve more of societies issues. Its also ironic that many of the people who would have been youth at the point of publishing this book are now the elder, ruling class, failing to adapt to our current world, holding us back. Maybe this is just part of the human condition and it is inevitable that we will fail future generations.Overall I would recommend anyone looking for insight into life during 1970 as well as a better way of looking at the future to read this book. It is well worth it."
195,0553101501,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20926327-lora-shouse,4,"When I was in college Future Shock was all over the shelves at the bookstore and everywhere. Obviously, I should have read it then. A least I could have added it to my book list; I hadn’t closed the first list at that time. But honestly, I don’t know when I would have had the time to read it. And anyway, there were other things I was more interested in at the time.When I was putting books on my second list years later, it occurred to me that I hadn’t ever read Future Shock, and, somewhat surprised that it was still around, I added it to the list at that time. So, now I have finally read it.The first three-quarters of the book or so are pretty fun. Toffler surveys some of the rapidly multiplying different ways of living that were coming into being or looked about to be coming into being and looks at the consequences of too much (or too little) change at one time. At close to fifty years later, I can say that much of what he predicted has in fact happened. I can’t vouch for every little thing he talked about, but he was right on the money about a lot of things like corporate mindset and changes in work – I have lived through a lot of exactly what he was talking about.I’m not sure the pace of change ever got to quite what he expected it to. It was, and still is, plenty fast, mind you, and for those people living on the cutting edge of change all the time I’m sure plenty have and still do experience the negative effects he pointed out. Maybe the increase in the rate of change finally got to a point where it could not keep continuing. Maybe factors such as the environmental movement began to act as kind of a drag on the pace of some kinds of changes. Maybe a large proportion of the population was just not able to change that fast. Anyway, I don’t think that the rate of change ever got quite as out-of-hand as he thought it might. At least not yet.The last quarter of the book, where he talks about what we can do to buffer ourselves against the worst of future shock is a little more boring. A lot of this is suggestions for suggestions. Some of it has been tried, at least on a limited basis. Occasionally cities will get together a planning group to try to plan out some aspects of their future – like what to do about transportation or jobs or living space. But I don’t think this has ever been done very extensively on a national or global level, or very often even on a more local level. And I’m not sure anybody knows how to educate children for a future that we don’t even know what it is yet.This was a library book."
196,0553101501,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12083674-michael-david,5,"When this book was written during the 1970s, the world was at the brink of a technological big bang. Alvin Toffler noticed the signs. He wrote about the signs and elaborated upon them in this book, Future Shock. 'Future shock' was the term he coined for the disease that would afflict unprepared individuals in the future. If I can describe the book in one word, it would be comprehensive. His treatise is full of corroborative references: in fact, 80 pages of the book are all his references. Notable among his points is that more knowledge has been accrued in the past fifty years than in the time between the 15th and 19th century. Among the important points in his treatise is the idea of transience pervading over our everyday lives. Everything is transient - not only things and places, but more importantly, even knowledge and people.In addition, the future also brings with it much novelty and an infinity of choices. Through numerous examples, Toffler claims that it is the lack of rootedness and the difficulty of choice that drives a lot of people towards a breakdown. Given what I perceive nowadays, it's impressive that Toffler was generally right. He had accurately predicted the irascibility of humans at this day and age: millennials nowadays have girlfriends or boyfriends as young as the age of ten; teenage pregnancies are becoming more and more common, and the lack of stability and rootedness within the family and society has fragmented less robust families. One shortcoming from Toffler's book was his inability to predict the repercussions of the personal computer. Because he was unable to predict the advent of the PC through the efforts of pioneers like Wozniak, Gates, and Jobs, he, in effect was conservative in his estimates. The personal computer drastically optimized the speed of new technologies entering our society and culture. The increased speed in computation transformed society, both positively and negatively: while we have information and knowledge at our fingertips, with ease of access, we also have developmentally delayed four-year old children whose tablets have become substitutes for creativity. Well, I guess Toffler was right all along: future shock has arrived. "

The book is an easy read with points that continue to have some resonance.Have you ever felt that change was coming too fast and frequently? This is a core tenant of Future Shock, written in a time when computer technology was new, adapting, and accelerating; where technology innovation continues presently. Alvin suggests that society and individuals must be willing to adapt as crucial criteria for success. He highlights that organizations and the world itself will adopt more fluid, shifting structures and interactions based on enabling technology. The internet as well as personal devices today are perfect examples for the fluid nature of how our social, professional and personal interactions with technology are tightly intertwined. However, he warns of the importance in striking a balance between real-world ""actual"" interactions and virtual ""vicarious"" experiences. We have all seen negative effects of technology and social engagement in our lives and communities that usually stem from assumptions that our digital or ""virtual"" experiences are not the same as in real life, leading to communications and actions that would otherwise never occur. He goes further to suggest that we must identify and develop personal ""stability zones"" that nurture our personal connections to one another or risk getting lost along the way, such as maintaining a healthy diet, exercise and leisure with strong, intimate relationships.Alvin successfully predicts that success supported by technology would necessitate invention simply to remain competitive while also emphasizing the important role of collaborative governance among businesses and governments as new technology is developed and introduced. He also correctly forecasts product variety and consumer choice as a result of all of this technology creation."

Outside of a few dated terms, much of what Toffler speaks to — the social, economic, political, and technological trends of the past, present and future — are addressed through their functional and affective aspects rather than broad speculation over the physical forms and precise implementations to which they are to take. For a book written in 1970, there’s still plenty of relevant information in here to think about.Toffler begins by giving us a broad overview of the state of contemporary society as it stood just as the USA’s golden age was coming to a close. Much of the initial chapters provide overviews of the sociological and psychosocial viewpoints of an uprooted and hyperactive tech-enabled “technosociety” (one of a few dated terms). Touching on the subjects of alienation, grounding, values and belief systems, a la carte lifestyles, political representation and knowledge, Toffler leaves no stone unturned as he exposes to us to the stark realities of the social dysfunction already well underway at the time of publication. Though it paints a rather bleak image of the future, much of what he speaks to remains entirely relevant today.Following the bleak evaluation of the foreseeable future insofar as he sees it, Toffler then speaks to the positive benefits and revelations that change is capable of producing. His case for the essential nature of change is well put though, at best, merely levels the scale between the pros and cons of our collective future.The final bit Toffler falls to a slightly more speculative but entirely theoretical tone in which he discusses some of his own potential solutions to mitigating the worst case social scenarios first presented and to the essential tasks he deemed necessary for our successful, albeit inevitable, march forward in time."

For a solid 75% of the book it’s easy to forget this was published 50 years ago, and then that other 25% makes you appreciate just how uncertain the year 2020 must have been. The most surprising result of reading this was this sense I developed that the world hasn’t really change that much. Sure, we’re technologically more advanced, and we’ve made fairly remarkable progress socially, but many of our stresses are the same. These paragraphs feel like that could have been published this week in a major news outlet:————Great cities are paralyzed by strikes, power failures, riots. International power alliances are shaken. Financial and political leaders secretly tremble--not out of fear that communist (or capitalist) revolutionaries will oust them, but that the entire system is somehow flying out of control.These are indisputable signs of a sick social structure, a society that can no longer perform even its most basic functions in the accustomed ways. It is a society caught in the agony of revolutionary change. In the 1920's and 1930's, communists used to speak of the ""general crisis of capitalism."" It is now clear that they were thinking small. What is occurring now is not a crisis of capitalism, but of industrial society itself, regardless of political form. We are simultaneously experiencing a youth revolution, a sexual revolution, a racial revolution, a colonial revolution, an economic revolution, and the most rapid and deep-going technological revolution in history. We are living through the general crisis of industrialism. In a word, we are in the midst of the super-industrial revolution.—————If the future scares you or excites you...this might be a good book to crack open. Certainly not for everyone though. "

This book influenced my understanding of technology, and helped me better understand the human context of relationships with technology today. Many of the cultural conditions and the relationships with technology in the past, have contributed to and thus can help us better understand our cultural conditions and relationships with technology today. Some of these things from the past that were discussed that I liked most, which help us understand the present:Disposability, consumption culture, and less attachment to specific places and things (we are often relocating for school and work and purchasing cheap new goods rather than repairing expensive existing goods). All of this may contribute to the transience we feel, the psychic pains from which I think we try to avoid through heavy interaction with social media and communication technology with our phones, texts, and emails... which I also think we try to avoid through general stimulation from today's more cheap, accessible modern drugs: video games and pornography.The main point is how the speed of technological change challenges our ability to understand it, process it, and adapt our behavior. Which is why he thinks there should be more attention to how it's shaping our lives in the present and will in the future (more futurists)."

Choice - and the criteria for choice - will be critical.” p.187 “Despite profound ethical questions about whether they should, the fact remains that scientific curiosity is, itself, one of the most powerful driving forces in our society.” p.189 “Many of us feel instinctive revulsion at the hazards of meddling with the finely balanced and far reaching systems that make an individual what he is.

I found that author is merely affected by sexizm, racizm and many other -izms, noticeable even for my russian origin. I am wondering, was it that bad at USA back in seventies? LOOOOLBtw, that book reminds me Futorology Congress by Stanislav Lem, that part about huge building built on seven columns, each of those reflects one of major religions. Lack of classical education makes author to create very sophisticated constructs, like five components: things, place, people, people place in socium and information. Author is trying to analyze everything by applying these five to it, but even failed to structurize his own book within these limitations. But, somehow he is right, life is getting faster, and, not everybody like that. Very noticeable part of that book is a way how author uses and interprets statistical data, very biased -izmish way, but, looks like it is quite common, especially in modern society.The best part of this book is it's name Future Shock, which was derived from Culture Shock, and I found it very lyrical :)Would not say that i like that book at all."

It was a surreal experience reading this - nothing felt shocking and nothing jarred... and then I would remember that he wrote this 47 years ago. For the most part, it is an extraordinary portrayal of the then-future/now-present and the challenges of transience, diversity, novelty and pace that he foresaw in 1970 have come home to roost: the cracks in democratic process, the opportunity for conscious evolution through gene technologies, the ever-increasing weight borne by our social services and education systems to look far enough ahead in order to create infrastructures that will be fit for future purpose.Toffler refers to Future Shock as his diagnosis, claiming ""we cannot begin to help ourselves until we become sensitively conscious of the problem."" He does offer a few solutions in Part 6: Strategies for Survival but these lack the detail and depth of the other five sections of the book. It's a thought-provoking read when you consider his foresight and wonder who today will portray our future 50 years out with similar prescience."

As I came across it on a bookshelf, even if in French, I started reading it asap.And I wasn't disappointed: first, the translation is absolutely perfect - hats off! Secondly, I kept wondering along each chapter why the analysis of the society back in the 70s could still apply half a century later... The main trends around the acceleration of change for all aspects in life (technological, (inter)personal, professional, etc.) are still so valid today that this is almost frightening...What did happen in the meantime?? Didn't the 80s also bring many societal changes? Or the Internet revolution in the late 90s? How come do we have the feeling that changes are still accelerating - and that most of the ""solutions"" proposed in the book could still apply today?This is a book I enjoyed reading, not to finger-point where the author didn't foresee something, but to reflect my own current situation and try to anticipate better the future shock :)"

It was way better than the last nonfiction book I read that was published in 2019.But he kind of lost me towards the end. He fails to predict the internet so he suggests “social assemblies” where everyone participates in decision making. And it’s like nobody has time for that! He doesn’t have a lot of faith in the system, and thinks we need to have all these meetings to predict the future. But if everyone was working to the future we would advance faster. He predicts that we will all be cyborgs in the future, writing in 1970. Then just sort of mentions computers and goes on. But it turns out it is really difficult to engineer medical devices.He does get sex robots right though. Apparently sex robots have been in the making for hundreds of years. Yes, men invented sex dolls as soon as they could. Also he suggests that in addition to History we could have a Future class, which is a good idea."

People keep on chanting ""change"" & ""being agile or you will perish"" kind of stuff. It sounds vague as their arguments remain unidimensional. Future Shock is able to cover all the aspects of humanity undergoing the roller coaster of alterations. It is so fun to read a reader can relate his life, the transition he witnessed around him from childhood to present. The part where my eyes got big was our future. The writer took today's practice and predicted our coming time. It was so convincing as if you are actually a part of it. Sometime readers may feel if the content is getting repeated but patience is the key because every chapter is completely new dimension relating other things. This book will you give extreme clarity about what is currently happening around & how to deal with it. I am literally forcing my close one to read this book and looking forward to reading other books of Alvin Toffler."

Half of it could have been cut with none of the content or ideas missing.It wasn't an important part of the book for me, but most of the future predictions were way off the mark - all predictions of the future seem to be far too optimistic in regards to dates. I sometimes wonder if this is something that's done on purpose, especially when selling a book. If you read a book in 1970 and it's predicting things for 2070 when you'll be long dead, you probably won't care as much as if they were predictions for the year 2000, when you'd be alive. I was impressed by his nearly perfect prediction of the Alexa device. I also liked his views on ""overchoice"" and what an issue that would become. I primarily read this to learn a bit more about the issues that can arise when society goes through rapid changes, like we are now, but I wouldn't say I gained a huge amount of insight. To sum the book up, extreme change can trigger lots of negative bodily reactions and it can affect a person's ability to act rationally."
209,0553101501,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10955515-neeraj,4,"In Future Shock, Toffler takes an incredibly fascinating look at the changes reverberating through super-industrial societies such as the U.S. and U.K. in the last 1960s and early 1970s. Toffler's decision to analyze then-current events and trends (e.g., countercultural movements and overconsumption of environmental resources) to predict what could happen in super-industrial societies in the next few decades proves insightful. Though Future Shock certainly drags at parts and some parts devolve into strange science fiction fantasies (underwater civilizations? cyborgs?), his analysis is remarkably prescient. I particularly enjoyed when Toffler predicted political and technological developments that we see today, such as the rise of an ideologue urging us to return to the ""glory days"" (Trump, anyone?) and the production of self-expression media, such as podcasts and online video. Future Shock isn't exactly a beach read, but it was well worth the time and effort I put into it. 9/10 stars."

It's amazing how a lot of the concerns and ideas are still relevant today. This is a quick read, however, I have too much read, so have been taking my time. Heavily influenced by Buckminster Fuller, and Toffler does seem to repeat himself often with out saying much in certain subparts of his chapters, but when he comes up with an idea, it strikes. What is wonderful is paging through his bibliography and finding other similar authors and theorists of the era (mid to late 60s) to read or add to the book shelf"

Toffler's fine work continues to amaze and surprise me with its accurate predictions. Future Shock, ahead of its time, explores the human socio-economic and psychological understanding and applies it to maximum effect. That at this point, upon reading sentence upon logical sentence, everything could only be nodded and agreed at. Perhaps not all arguments flexed in this book may be fully accurate, but for a book published way back then when these concepts were close to foreign - It makes reading it a delight and would definitely send shivers down your spine."

In a nutshell what this book says is that we can expect from the future a more modular, segmented life, this includes personal lives as well. I've only taken off one star because I feel some of the adaptation strategies towards the future may be kind of lacking, but for a tough book judge like myself 4 stars is a very high rating, therefore I recommend this book if you're on the fence about reading it."

Book contains interesting concepts and is only occasionaly far of the mark with futuristic predictions.I also liked the concept of adhocracy that will replace bureaucracy; increases adaptability of organizations (I suppose current term would be 'agile') but strains adaptibility of men."

222,0553101501,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13459886-yhc,2,"In my previous book Present Shock: When Everything Happens Now that i enjoyed a lot, it mentioned about this very famous book, future shock and i have it with me for long but never got the chance to read it(also all his other books that i will surely read over ). This book was published in 1970, almost 5 decades ago, therefore i read it as a sci-fi futurist book with the touch of Utopian style. Considering it has been almost 50 years old, Toffler got pretty precise prediction on most of the things he predicted in the book, but what i want to mentioned here is the one he failed to predicted and the reality was rather disappointing. Most of his predictions are around society, education, population change, science development, human relationship, companies...etc.1. He didn't mention anything about globalization, I think at that time this is still pretty new. We feel the commerce is going to develop over continents but globally in the way we are today is indeed fast.2. He didn't mention about banking system would actually became such fatal role to control this planet, the repeated financial crisis doesn't teach us to learn lessons.3. The political development was rarely mentioned, he mentioned about socialist democracy but not capitalized communism...who would know that the biggest politically communism, China, embrace capitalism economically so well now.4. During the cold war, Soviet and USA had space race so we sent people to space and to the moon. In this book, Toffler mentioned many times about space development would reach certain level that we will have so ""many"" astronomers actually live in ISS. (heartache!) Who would know that 50 years later, our astronomers only stay on earth orbit, and never set their foot back to the moon. Luckily we have a big dreams soon with SpaceX to go beyond the moon. Let's pack soon to Mars. Am I allowed to dream big before i get old?5. In Toffler's farest dream, he would never know that one day, the war between 2 countries could be like Virtual Reality games. One side with real casualties, the other would remotely control the drone through screen in another side of the earth, after the mission is done, this few people military still can go back home having dinner with their family. (mentioned in my last book Present Shock: When Everything Happens Now ) 6. Far from training dolphins to be our deep sea exploring partners, we exploit their home, pollute their space into continental size of plastic island. Well done Humans! And of course, we hunt dolphins ,whales, and many other kinds of sea animals with big corporation ship that spare-nothing-kind-of-fishing Nets. (wonder why they don't use their super Nets to clean up the plastic island shit instead)7. Genetically modified on Wild animals to be more docile? Why? Toffler? I thought most of them are killed by humans, docile or not, we just invade their home for the sake of humans!8. 24 hours day light thanks to big mirror reflect from space with satellites to light up the dark side of earth. Toffler mentioned about day light needed in winter time of Scandinavia, which is understandable. for plants to grow, yes. But if for the sake of industry 24 hours function, so human also taking shift to keep working. No way.....give this poor ear a break! we have enough stuff that we don't really need but fabricated. I think this book still have many things for us to actually take into consideration, but like i say, the power is in the hands of big corporations, they don't care about what skin colors we are, what political situation you believe, they just want money!! and Money craving is good enough to destroy this world, and that is the biggest shock!"
223,0553101501,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63892286-sheryl-mccoy,5,"It's difficult to rate ""Future Shock"" highly when reading it is like watching the destruction of civilization in slow motion. Yet, the book is a great read...if you think it's science fiction. These events laid out in this book were not BOUND TO HAPPEN, they were FORCED TO HAPPEN, much like the Shadow Wars in Babylon 5. It wasn't destiny, so much as brain-washing, that makes this future a real possibility.""Future Shock"" is one of the first books to lay out how the unscrupulous would use what we now call ""persuasive technology"" to ensure the rise of a corporate feudal system. from the golden age of corporate capitalism where criminal elements within the Nixon government and corporations began to be recognized as NORMAL. If you didn't realize this, you better go back and read ""Future Shock"" and the companion books again. Most people read Toffler's books and see themselves as the ONE who will rise above the dross. Don't be fooled. This book, Future Shock, is one of a set of cookbooks, including ""The Third Wave"", ""Power Shift"" and others that have been used to ""cook up"" a dismal future for most humans. If you aren't IN THE GROUP MAKING THIS HAPPEN, you aren't in...you are among the dross.At one time, I thought Toffler would find people to put on the brakes to this change in worldview, but that never happened. Let me remind you that NONE OF US who use and rely on public online spaces will be in the upper or even midling echelons of future/present/past feudal leaders. Some politicians like Newt Gingrich and others helped Toffler create this new world through the various laws and groups who control the ""confused"" majority. It's highly unlikely that those of us who saw it all along will make much of a dent in stopping it. When I read Future Shock, I was also reading a great many other books which aligned with the future or aligned with this book in science fiction. It took me a decade before I figured out that this man was laying out A REAL PLAN to put most of us (the 99%) into a state of modern servitude where governments and constitutions of the 2oth century have fallen. The independent person had fallen. There is no fiction here. Think of this plan as an explanation of how Huxley's ""Brave New World"" could come into existence.It seems to me that Toffler's writing style was very engaging, yet alarming in the way he spoke of a return to a recognizable feudal state. A CORPORATE feudal state was described and honored by Toffler. I remember wondering if this could be resisted. I learned that it could not. From the late 1980's until Toffler's death, I watched as he wrote less for a public audience and more for a nouveau feudal ruling class. He and his wife gave conferences and developed relationships with ""leaders"" to maximize ways to create the new corporate feudal system. It seemed to me that he and his wife were glad to be plugged into the process of turning the majority of humans into corporate serfs. I remember one part of his first book included warnings that you would not be able to resist. If you did resist, you would be completely locked out of the corporate-based feudal world. This meant that personal ownership outside the corporate feudal systems would eventually disappear, unless you had some value to the overlords. Take these books for what you will. If you're confused, don't worry...you are just where Toffler and his minions knew you would be."

As a book about the future and how to adapt to its inevitable change it was an interesting time to read it. Due to the fact that I am 50 years removed from the world in which it was written in I am given a very different mindset to read it in. My enjoyment of the book comes partially from looking back with 2020 hindsight and partially from finding its original message still relevant today. The introductory chapters of this book explain just how fast our society started moving in the 20th century. Compared to today this rate of advancement has only increased in acceleration. 1970 marks one of the earliest generations to notice how fast information moves and how quick things can change. I can only imagine how intense this period must have been as no other period of human history progress at the pace of the first 70 years of the 20th century, at that point.A lot of the first half of the book discusses many of the trends of 1970. Toffler projects how changes that happened in the prior half of the 20th century will affect the years after. It was great to see what was seen as revolutionary or points of interest to a person of this time. As someone who finds the 20th century to be one of the most interesting points of history to study, a lot of this book was a pleasure to read. There is a wide variety of subjects covered in this book. Because of this some chapters might interest certain readers more than others. By covering all of these trends the book can feel like it is part history, sociology, philosophy, anthropology, futurist, and business. As a business school graduate some of the chapters on consumer trends were great insight into marketing knowledge of the day, even if some of the information is rudimentary today.Toffler makes many speculations about the future and surprisingly a lot of them turn out to have become true. Granted there are a few subjects he misses on but they are still fun to read about, they just feel more sci-fi than realistic.The overall message of Future Shock is to address the trend of rapid change that forces human beings obsolete if they don't know how to adapt with the changes and learn current information. He offers so many great insights and the fact that they are still relevant really shows how this book is still useful to read today. That being said, reading this 50 years on and realizing not that much has changed is a depressing thought. If more people had read this book back then and incorporated its message into their lives maybe we'd have solve more of societies issues. Its also ironic that many of the people who would have been youth at the point of publishing this book are now the elder, ruling class, failing to adapt to our current world, holding us back. Maybe this is just part of the human condition and it is inevitable that we will fail future generations.Overall I would recommend anyone looking for insight into life during 1970 as well as a better way of looking at the future to read this book. It is well worth it."

Obviously, I should have read it then. A least I could have added it to my book list; I hadn’t closed the first list at that time. But honestly, I don’t know when I would have had the time to read it. And anyway, there were other things I was more interested in at the time.When I was putting books on my second list years later, it occurred to me that I hadn’t ever read Future Shock, and, somewhat surprised that it was still around, I added it to the list at that time. So, now I have finally read it.The first three-quarters of the book or so are pretty fun. Toffler surveys some of the rapidly multiplying different ways of living that were coming into being or looked about to be coming into being and looks at the consequences of too much (or too little) change at one time. At close to fifty years later, I can say that much of what he predicted has in fact happened. I can’t vouch for every little thing he talked about, but he was right on the money about a lot of things like corporate mindset and changes in work – I have lived through a lot of exactly what he was talking about.I’m not sure the pace of change ever got to quite what he expected it to. It was, and still is, plenty fast, mind you, and for those people living on the cutting edge of change all the time I’m sure plenty have and still do experience the negative effects he pointed out. Maybe the increase in the rate of change finally got to a point where it could not keep continuing. Maybe factors such as the environmental movement began to act as kind of a drag on the pace of some kinds of changes. Maybe a large proportion of the population was just not able to change that fast. Anyway, I don’t think that the rate of change ever got quite as out-of-hand as he thought it might. At least not yet.The last quarter of the book, where he talks about what we can do to buffer ourselves against the worst of future shock is a little more boring. A lot of this is suggestions for suggestions. Some of it has been tried, at least on a limited basis. Occasionally cities will get together a planning group to try to plan out some aspects of their future – like what to do about transportation or jobs or living space. But I don’t think this has ever been done very extensively on a national or global level, or very often even on a more local level. And I’m not sure anybody knows how to educate children for a future that we don’t even know what it is yet.This was a library book."
226,0553101501,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12083674-michael-david,5,"When this book was written during the 1970s, the world was at the brink of a technological big bang. Alvin Toffler noticed the signs. He wrote about the signs and elaborated upon them in this book, Future Shock. 'Future shock' was the term he coined for the disease that would afflict unprepared individuals in the future. If I can describe the book in one word, it would be comprehensive. His treatise is full of corroborative references: in fact, 80 pages of the book are all his references. Notable among his points is that more knowledge has been accrued in the past fifty years than in the time between the 15th and 19th century. Among the important points in his treatise is the idea of transience pervading over our everyday lives. Everything is transient - not only things and places, but more importantly, even knowledge and people.In addition, the future also brings with it much novelty and an infinity of choices. Through numerous examples, Toffler claims that it is the lack of rootedness and the difficulty of choice that drives a lot of people towards a breakdown. Given what I perceive nowadays, it's impressive that Toffler was generally right. He had accurately predicted the irascibility of humans at this day and age: millennials nowadays have girlfriends or boyfriends as young as the age of ten; teenage pregnancies are becoming more and more common, and the lack of stability and rootedness within the family and society has fragmented less robust families. One shortcoming from Toffler's book was his inability to predict the repercussions of the personal computer. Because he was unable to predict the advent of the PC through the efforts of pioneers like Wozniak, Gates, and Jobs, he, in effect was conservative in his estimates. The personal computer drastically optimized the speed of new technologies entering our society and culture. The increased speed in computation transformed society, both positively and negatively: while we have information and knowledge at our fingertips, with ease of access, we also have developmentally delayed four-year old children whose tablets have become substitutes for creativity. Well, I guess Toffler was right all along: future shock has arrived. "
227,0553101501,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4872710-eric-swanson,3,"Was a crystal ball for society and technology.Alvin's insights in this book included many accurate predictions for how society would engage and embrace technology in the past future. The book is an easy read with points that continue to have some resonance.Have you ever felt that change was coming too fast and frequently? This is a core tenant of Future Shock, written in a time when computer technology was new, adapting, and accelerating; where technology innovation continues presently. Alvin suggests that society and individuals must be willing to adapt as crucial criteria for success. He highlights that organizations and the world itself will adopt more fluid, shifting structures and interactions based on enabling technology. The internet as well as personal devices today are perfect examples for the fluid nature of how our social, professional and personal interactions with technology are tightly intertwined. However, he warns of the importance in striking a balance between real-world ""actual"" interactions and virtual ""vicarious"" experiences. We have all seen negative effects of technology and social engagement in our lives and communities that usually stem from assumptions that our digital or ""virtual"" experiences are not the same as in real life, leading to communications and actions that would otherwise never occur. He goes further to suggest that we must identify and develop personal ""stability zones"" that nurture our personal connections to one another or risk getting lost along the way, such as maintaining a healthy diet, exercise and leisure with strong, intimate relationships.Alvin successfully predicts that success supported by technology would necessitate invention simply to remain competitive while also emphasizing the important role of collaborative governance among businesses and governments as new technology is developed and introduced. He also correctly forecasts product variety and consumer choice as a result of all of this technology creation."
228,0553101501,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4876036-mitch-anderson,3,"Ignore the year of publication and rest assured — you’re sure to learn something of interest from Alvin Toffler’s Future Shock. Outside of a few dated terms, much of what Toffler speaks to — the social, economic, political, and technological trends of the past, present and future — are addressed through their functional and affective aspects rather than broad speculation over the physical forms and precise implementations to which they are to take. For a book written in 1970, there’s still plenty of relevant information in here to think about.Toffler begins by giving us a broad overview of the state of contemporary society as it stood just as the USA’s golden age was coming to a close. Much of the initial chapters provide overviews of the sociological and psychosocial viewpoints of an uprooted and hyperactive tech-enabled “technosociety” (one of a few dated terms). Touching on the subjects of alienation, grounding, values and belief systems, a la carte lifestyles, political representation and knowledge, Toffler leaves no stone unturned as he exposes to us to the stark realities of the social dysfunction already well underway at the time of publication. Though it paints a rather bleak image of the future, much of what he speaks to remains entirely relevant today.Following the bleak evaluation of the foreseeable future insofar as he sees it, Toffler then speaks to the positive benefits and revelations that change is capable of producing. His case for the essential nature of change is well put though, at best, merely levels the scale between the pros and cons of our collective future.The final bit Toffler falls to a slightly more speculative but entirely theoretical tone in which he discusses some of his own potential solutions to mitigating the worst case social scenarios first presented and to the essential tasks he deemed necessary for our successful, albeit inevitable, march forward in time."
229,0553101501,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22452050-john,4,"3.5/5 — Shocking how many areas Toffler got right about the future. For a solid 75% of the book it’s easy to forget this was published 50 years ago, and then that other 25% makes you appreciate just how uncertain the year 2020 must have been. The most surprising result of reading this was this sense I developed that the world hasn’t really change that much. Sure, we’re technologically more advanced, and we’ve made fairly remarkable progress socially, but many of our stresses are the same. These paragraphs feel like that could have been published this week in a major news outlet:————Great cities are paralyzed by strikes, power failures, riots. International power alliances are shaken. Financial and political leaders secretly tremble--not out of fear that communist (or capitalist) revolutionaries will oust them, but that the entire system is somehow flying out of control.These are indisputable signs of a sick social structure, a society that can no longer perform even its most basic functions in the accustomed ways. It is a society caught in the agony of revolutionary change. In the 1920's and 1930's, communists used to speak of the ""general crisis of capitalism."" It is now clear that they were thinking small. What is occurring now is not a crisis of capitalism, but of industrial society itself, regardless of political form. We are simultaneously experiencing a youth revolution, a sexual revolution, a racial revolution, a colonial revolution, an economic revolution, and the most rapid and deep-going technological revolution in history. We are living through the general crisis of industrialism. In a word, we are in the midst of the super-industrial revolution.—————If the future scares you or excites you...this might be a good book to crack open. Certainly not for everyone though. "

This book influenced my understanding of technology, and helped me better understand the human context of relationships with technology today. Many of the cultural conditions and the relationships with technology in the past, have contributed to and thus can help us better understand our cultural conditions and relationships with technology today. Some of these things from the past that were discussed that I liked most, which help us understand the present:Disposability, consumption culture, and less attachment to specific places and things (we are often relocating for school and work and purchasing cheap new goods rather than repairing expensive existing goods). All of this may contribute to the transience we feel, the psychic pains from which I think we try to avoid through heavy interaction with social media and communication technology with our phones, texts, and emails... which I also think we try to avoid through general stimulation from today's more cheap, accessible modern drugs: video games and pornography.The main point is how the speed of technological change challenges our ability to understand it, process it, and adapt our behavior. Which is why he thinks there should be more attention to how it's shaping our lives in the present and will in the future (more futurists)."

Choice - and the criteria for choice - will be critical.” p.187 “Despite profound ethical questions about whether they should, the fact remains that scientific curiosity is, itself, one of the most powerful driving forces in our society.” p.189 “Many of us feel instinctive revulsion at the hazards of meddling with the finely balanced and far reaching systems that make an individual what he is.

I found that author is merely affected by sexizm, racizm and many other -izms, noticeable even for my russian origin. I am wondering, was it that bad at USA back in seventies? LOOOOLBtw, that book reminds me Futorology Congress by Stanislav Lem, that part about huge building built on seven columns, each of those reflects one of major religions. Lack of classical education makes author to create very sophisticated constructs, like five components: things, place, people, people place in socium and information. Author is trying to analyze everything by applying these five to it, but even failed to structurize his own book within these limitations. But, somehow he is right, life is getting faster, and, not everybody like that. Very noticeable part of that book is a way how author uses and interprets statistical data, very biased -izmish way, but, looks like it is quite common, especially in modern society.The best part of this book is it's name Future Shock, which was derived from Culture Shock, and I found it very lyrical :)Would not say that i like that book at all."

It was a surreal experience reading this - nothing felt shocking and nothing jarred... and then I would remember that he wrote this 47 years ago. For the most part, it is an extraordinary portrayal of the then-future/now-present and the challenges of transience, diversity, novelty and pace that he foresaw in 1970 have come home to roost: the cracks in democratic process, the opportunity for conscious evolution through gene technologies, the ever-increasing weight borne by our social services and education systems to look far enough ahead in order to create infrastructures that will be fit for future purpose.Toffler refers to Future Shock as his diagnosis, claiming ""we cannot begin to help ourselves until we become sensitively conscious of the problem."" He does offer a few solutions in Part 6: Strategies for Survival but these lack the detail and depth of the other five sections of the book. It's a thought-provoking read when you consider his foresight and wonder who today will portray our future 50 years out with similar prescience."

As I came across it on a bookshelf, even if in French, I started reading it asap.And I wasn't disappointed: first, the translation is absolutely perfect - hats off! Secondly, I kept wondering along each chapter why the analysis of the society back in the 70s could still apply half a century later... The main trends around the acceleration of change for all aspects in life (technological, (inter)personal, professional, etc.) are still so valid today that this is almost frightening...What did happen in the meantime?? Didn't the 80s also bring many societal changes? Or the Internet revolution in the late 90s? How come do we have the feeling that changes are still accelerating - and that most of the ""solutions"" proposed in the book could still apply today?This is a book I enjoyed reading, not to finger-point where the author didn't foresee something, but to reflect my own current situation and try to anticipate better the future shock :)"

It was way better than the last nonfiction book I read that was published in 2019.But he kind of lost me towards the end. He fails to predict the internet so he suggests “social assemblies” where everyone participates in decision making. And it’s like nobody has time for that! He doesn’t have a lot of faith in the system, and thinks we need to have all these meetings to predict the future. But if everyone was working to the future we would advance faster. He predicts that we will all be cyborgs in the future, writing in 1970. Then just sort of mentions computers and goes on. But it turns out it is really difficult to engineer medical devices.He does get sex robots right though. Apparently sex robots have been in the making for hundreds of years. Yes, men invented sex dolls as soon as they could. Also he suggests that in addition to History we could have a Future class, which is a good idea."

People keep on chanting ""change"" & ""being agile or you will perish"" kind of stuff. It sounds vague as their arguments remain unidimensional. Future Shock is able to cover all the aspects of humanity undergoing the roller coaster of alterations. It is so fun to read a reader can relate his life, the transition he witnessed around him from childhood to present. The part where my eyes got big was our future. The writer took today's practice and predicted our coming time. It was so convincing as if you are actually a part of it. Sometime readers may feel if the content is getting repeated but patience is the key because every chapter is completely new dimension relating other things. This book will you give extreme clarity about what is currently happening around & how to deal with it. I am literally forcing my close one to read this book and looking forward to reading other books of Alvin Toffler."

Half of it could have been cut with none of the content or ideas missing.It wasn't an important part of the book for me, but most of the future predictions were way off the mark - all predictions of the future seem to be far too optimistic in regards to dates. I sometimes wonder if this is something that's done on purpose, especially when selling a book. If you read a book in 1970 and it's predicting things for 2070 when you'll be long dead, you probably won't care as much as if they were predictions for the year 2000, when you'd be alive. I was impressed by his nearly perfect prediction of the Alexa device. I also liked his views on ""overchoice"" and what an issue that would become. I primarily read this to learn a bit more about the issues that can arise when society goes through rapid changes, like we are now, but I wouldn't say I gained a huge amount of insight. To sum the book up, extreme change can trigger lots of negative bodily reactions and it can affect a person's ability to act rationally."

Toffler's decision to analyze then-current events and trends (e.g., countercultural movements and overconsumption of environmental resources) to predict what could happen in super-industrial societies in the next few decades proves insightful. Though Future Shock certainly drags at parts and some parts devolve into strange science fiction fantasies (underwater civilizations? cyborgs?), his analysis is remarkably prescient. I particularly enjoyed when Toffler predicted political and technological developments that we see today, such as the rise of an ideologue urging us to return to the ""glory days"" (Trump, anyone?) and the production of self-expression media, such as podcasts and online video. Future Shock isn't exactly a beach read, but it was well worth the time and effort I put into it. 9/10 stars."

It's amazing how a lot of the concerns and ideas are still relevant today. This is a quick read, however, I have too much read, so have been taking my time. Heavily influenced by Buckminster Fuller, and Toffler does seem to repeat himself often with out saying much in certain subparts of his chapters, but when he comes up with an idea, it strikes. What is wonderful is paging through his bibliography and finding other similar authors and theorists of the era (mid to late 60s) to read or add to the book shelf"

Future Shock, ahead of its time, explores the human socio-economic and psychological understanding and applies it to maximum effect. That at this point, upon reading sentence upon logical sentence, everything could only be nodded and agreed at. Perhaps not all arguments flexed in this book may be fully accurate, but for a book published way back then when these concepts were close to foreign - It makes reading it a delight and would definitely send shivers down your spine."

I've only taken off one star because I feel some of the adaptation strategies towards the future may be kind of lacking, but for a tough book judge like myself 4 stars is a very high rating, therefore I recommend this book if you're on the fence about reading it."

This book was published in 1970, almost 5 decades ago, therefore i read it as a sci-fi futurist book with the touch of Utopian style. Considering it has been almost 50 years old, Toffler got pretty precise prediction on most of the things he predicted in the book, but what i want to mentioned here is the one he failed to predicted and the reality was rather disappointing. Most of his predictions are around society, education, population change, science development, human relationship, companies...etc.1. He didn't mention anything about globalization, I think at that time this is still pretty new. We feel the commerce is going to develop over continents but globally in the way we are today is indeed fast.2. He didn't mention about banking system would actually became such fatal role to control this planet, the repeated financial crisis doesn't teach us to learn lessons.3. The political development was rarely mentioned, he mentioned about socialist democracy but not capitalized communism...who would know that the biggest politically communism, China, embrace capitalism economically so well now.4. During the cold war, Soviet and USA had space race so we sent people to space and to the moon. In this book, Toffler mentioned many times about space development would reach certain level that we will have so ""many"" astronomers actually live in ISS. (heartache!) Who would know that 50 years later, our astronomers only stay on earth orbit, and never set their foot back to the moon. Luckily we have a big dreams soon with SpaceX to go beyond the moon. Let's pack soon to Mars. Am I allowed to dream big before i get old?5. In Toffler's farest dream, he would never know that one day, the war between 2 countries could be like Virtual Reality games. One side with real casualties, the other would remotely control the drone through screen in another side of the earth, after the mission is done, this few people military still can go back home having dinner with their family. (mentioned in my last book Present Shock: When Everything Happens Now ) 6. Far from training dolphins to be our deep sea exploring partners, we exploit their home, pollute their space into continental size of plastic island. Well done Humans! And of course, we hunt dolphins ,whales, and many other kinds of sea animals with big corporation ship that spare-nothing-kind-of-fishing Nets. (wonder why they don't use their super Nets to clean up the plastic island shit instead)7. Genetically modified on Wild animals to be more docile? Why? Toffler? I thought most of them are killed by humans, docile or not, we just invade their home for the sake of humans!8. 24 hours day light thanks to big mirror reflect from space with satellites to light up the dark side of earth. Toffler mentioned about day light needed in winter time of Scandinavia, which is understandable. for plants to grow, yes. But if for the sake of industry 24 hours function, so human also taking shift to keep working. No way.....give this poor ear a break! we have enough stuff that we don't really need but fabricated. I think this book still have many things for us to actually take into consideration, but like i say, the power is in the hands of big corporations, they don't care about what skin colors we are, what political situation you believe, they just want money!! and Money craving is good enough to destroy this world, and that is the biggest shock!"
253,0553101501,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63892286-sheryl-mccoy,5,"It's difficult to rate ""Future Shock"" highly when reading it is like watching the destruction of civilization in slow motion. Yet, the book is a great read...if you think it's science fiction. These events laid out in this book were not BOUND TO HAPPEN, they were FORCED TO HAPPEN, much like the Shadow Wars in Babylon 5. It wasn't destiny, so much as brain-washing, that makes this future a real possibility.""Future Shock"" is one of the first books to lay out how the unscrupulous would use what we now call ""persuasive technology"" to ensure the rise of a corporate feudal system. from the golden age of corporate capitalism where criminal elements within the Nixon government and corporations began to be recognized as NORMAL. If you didn't realize this, you better go back and read ""Future Shock"" and the companion books again. Most people read Toffler's books and see themselves as the ONE who will rise above the dross. Don't be fooled. This book, Future Shock, is one of a set of cookbooks, including ""The Third Wave"", ""Power Shift"" and others that have been used to ""cook up"" a dismal future for most humans. If you aren't IN THE GROUP MAKING THIS HAPPEN, you aren't in...you are among the dross.At one time, I thought Toffler would find people to put on the brakes to this change in worldview, but that never happened. Let me remind you that NONE OF US who use and rely on public online spaces will be in the upper or even midling echelons of future/present/past feudal leaders. Some politicians like Newt Gingrich and others helped Toffler create this new world through the various laws and groups who control the ""confused"" majority. It's highly unlikely that those of us who saw it all along will make much of a dent in stopping it. When I read Future Shock, I was also reading a great many other books which aligned with the future or aligned with this book in science fiction. It took me a decade before I figured out that this man was laying out A REAL PLAN to put most of us (the 99%) into a state of modern servitude where governments and constitutions of the 2oth century have fallen. The independent person had fallen. There is no fiction here. Think of this plan as an explanation of how Huxley's ""Brave New World"" could come into existence.It seems to me that Toffler's writing style was very engaging, yet alarming in the way he spoke of a return to a recognizable feudal state. A CORPORATE feudal state was described and honored by Toffler. I remember wondering if this could be resisted. I learned that it could not. From the late 1980's until Toffler's death, I watched as he wrote less for a public audience and more for a nouveau feudal ruling class. He and his wife gave conferences and developed relationships with ""leaders"" to maximize ways to create the new corporate feudal system. It seemed to me that he and his wife were glad to be plugged into the process of turning the majority of humans into corporate serfs. I remember one part of his first book included warnings that you would not be able to resist. If you did resist, you would be completely locked out of the corporate-based feudal world. This meant that personal ownership outside the corporate feudal systems would eventually disappear, unless you had some value to the overlords. Take these books for what you will. If you're confused, don't worry...you are just where Toffler and his minions knew you would be."
254,0553101501,http://goodreads.com/user/show/98347967-john,5,"2020 marks 50 years since Future Shock was first published. As a book about the future and how to adapt to its inevitable change it was an interesting time to read it. Due to the fact that I am 50 years removed from the world in which it was written in I am given a very different mindset to read it in. My enjoyment of the book comes partially from looking back with 2020 hindsight and partially from finding its original message still relevant today. The introductory chapters of this book explain just how fast our society started moving in the 20th century. Compared to today this rate of advancement has only increased in acceleration. 1970 marks one of the earliest generations to notice how fast information moves and how quick things can change. I can only imagine how intense this period must have been as no other period of human history progress at the pace of the first 70 years of the 20th century, at that point.A lot of the first half of the book discusses many of the trends of 1970. Toffler projects how changes that happened in the prior half of the 20th century will affect the years after. It was great to see what was seen as revolutionary or points of interest to a person of this time. As someone who finds the 20th century to be one of the most interesting points of history to study, a lot of this book was a pleasure to read. There is a wide variety of subjects covered in this book. Because of this some chapters might interest certain readers more than others. By covering all of these trends the book can feel like it is part history, sociology, philosophy, anthropology, futurist, and business. As a business school graduate some of the chapters on consumer trends were great insight into marketing knowledge of the day, even if some of the information is rudimentary today.Toffler makes many speculations about the future and surprisingly a lot of them turn out to have become true. Granted there are a few subjects he misses on but they are still fun to read about, they just feel more sci-fi than realistic.The overall message of Future Shock is to address the trend of rapid change that forces human beings obsolete if they don't know how to adapt with the changes and learn current information. He offers so many great insights and the fact that they are still relevant really shows how this book is still useful to read today. That being said, reading this 50 years on and realizing not that much has changed is a depressing thought. If more people had read this book back then and incorporated its message into their lives maybe we'd have solve more of societies issues. Its also ironic that many of the people who would have been youth at the point of publishing this book are now the elder, ruling class, failing to adapt to our current world, holding us back. Maybe this is just part of the human condition and it is inevitable that we will fail future generations.Overall I would recommend anyone looking for insight into life during 1970 as well as a better way of looking at the future to read this book. It is well worth it."
255,0553101501,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20926327-lora-shouse,4,"When I was in college Future Shock was all over the shelves at the bookstore and everywhere. Obviously, I should have read it then. A least I could have added it to my book list; I hadn’t closed the first list at that time. But honestly, I don’t know when I would have had the time to read it. And anyway, there were other things I was more interested in at the time.When I was putting books on my second list years later, it occurred to me that I hadn’t ever read Future Shock, and, somewhat surprised that it was still around, I added it to the list at that time. So, now I have finally read it.The first three-quarters of the book or so are pretty fun. Toffler surveys some of the rapidly multiplying different ways of living that were coming into being or looked about to be coming into being and looks at the consequences of too much (or too little) change at one time. At close to fifty years later, I can say that much of what he predicted has in fact happened. I can’t vouch for every little thing he talked about, but he was right on the money about a lot of things like corporate mindset and changes in work – I have lived through a lot of exactly what he was talking about.I’m not sure the pace of change ever got to quite what he expected it to. It was, and still is, plenty fast, mind you, and for those people living on the cutting edge of change all the time I’m sure plenty have and still do experience the negative effects he pointed out. Maybe the increase in the rate of change finally got to a point where it could not keep continuing. Maybe factors such as the environmental movement began to act as kind of a drag on the pace of some kinds of changes. Maybe a large proportion of the population was just not able to change that fast. Anyway, I don’t think that the rate of change ever got quite as out-of-hand as he thought it might. At least not yet.The last quarter of the book, where he talks about what we can do to buffer ourselves against the worst of future shock is a little more boring. A lot of this is suggestions for suggestions. Some of it has been tried, at least on a limited basis. Occasionally cities will get together a planning group to try to plan out some aspects of their future – like what to do about transportation or jobs or living space. But I don’t think this has ever been done very extensively on a national or global level, or very often even on a more local level. And I’m not sure anybody knows how to educate children for a future that we don’t even know what it is yet.This was a library book."
256,0553101501,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12083674-michael-david,5,"When this book was written during the 1970s, the world was at the brink of a technological big bang. Alvin Toffler noticed the signs. He wrote about the signs and elaborated upon them in this book, Future Shock. 'Future shock' was the term he coined for the disease that would afflict unprepared individuals in the future. If I can describe the book in one word, it would be comprehensive. His treatise is full of corroborative references: in fact, 80 pages of the book are all his references. Notable among his points is that more knowledge has been accrued in the past fifty years than in the time between the 15th and 19th century. Among the important points in his treatise is the idea of transience pervading over our everyday lives. Everything is transient - not only things and places, but more importantly, even knowledge and people.In addition, the future also brings with it much novelty and an infinity of choices. Through numerous examples, Toffler claims that it is the lack of rootedness and the difficulty of choice that drives a lot of people towards a breakdown. Given what I perceive nowadays, it's impressive that Toffler was generally right. He had accurately predicted the irascibility of humans at this day and age: millennials nowadays have girlfriends or boyfriends as young as the age of ten; teenage pregnancies are becoming more and more common, and the lack of stability and rootedness within the family and society has fragmented less robust families. One shortcoming from Toffler's book was his inability to predict the repercussions of the personal computer. Because he was unable to predict the advent of the PC through the efforts of pioneers like Wozniak, Gates, and Jobs, he, in effect was conservative in his estimates. The personal computer drastically optimized the speed of new technologies entering our society and culture. The increased speed in computation transformed society, both positively and negatively: while we have information and knowledge at our fingertips, with ease of access, we also have developmentally delayed four-year old children whose tablets have become substitutes for creativity. Well, I guess Toffler was right all along: future shock has arrived. "
257,0553101501,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4872710-eric-swanson,3,"Was a crystal ball for society and technology.Alvin's insights in this book included many accurate predictions for how society would engage and embrace technology in the past future. The book is an easy read with points that continue to have some resonance.Have you ever felt that change was coming too fast and frequently? This is a core tenant of Future Shock, written in a time when computer technology was new, adapting, and accelerating; where technology innovation continues presently. Alvin suggests that society and individuals must be willing to adapt as crucial criteria for success. He highlights that organizations and the world itself will adopt more fluid, shifting structures and interactions based on enabling technology. The internet as well as personal devices today are perfect examples for the fluid nature of how our social, professional and personal interactions with technology are tightly intertwined. However, he warns of the importance in striking a balance between real-world ""actual"" interactions and virtual ""vicarious"" experiences. We have all seen negative effects of technology and social engagement in our lives and communities that usually stem from assumptions that our digital or ""virtual"" experiences are not the same as in real life, leading to communications and actions that would otherwise never occur. He goes further to suggest that we must identify and develop personal ""stability zones"" that nurture our personal connections to one another or risk getting lost along the way, such as maintaining a healthy diet, exercise and leisure with strong, intimate relationships.Alvin successfully predicts that success supported by technology would necessitate invention simply to remain competitive while also emphasizing the important role of collaborative governance among businesses and governments as new technology is developed and introduced. He also correctly forecasts product variety and consumer choice as a result of all of this technology creation."
258,0553101501,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4876036-mitch-anderson,3,"Ignore the year of publication and rest assured — you’re sure to learn something of interest from Alvin Toffler’s Future Shock. Outside of a few dated terms, much of what Toffler speaks to — the social, economic, political, and technological trends of the past, present and future — are addressed through their functional and affective aspects rather than broad speculation over the physical forms and precise implementations to which they are to take. For a book written in 1970, there’s still plenty of relevant information in here to think about.Toffler begins by giving us a broad overview of the state of contemporary society as it stood just as the USA’s golden age was coming to a close. Much of the initial chapters provide overviews of the sociological and psychosocial viewpoints of an uprooted and hyperactive tech-enabled “technosociety” (one of a few dated terms). Touching on the subjects of alienation, grounding, values and belief systems, a la carte lifestyles, political representation and knowledge, Toffler leaves no stone unturned as he exposes to us to the stark realities of the social dysfunction already well underway at the time of publication. Though it paints a rather bleak image of the future, much of what he speaks to remains entirely relevant today.Following the bleak evaluation of the foreseeable future insofar as he sees it, Toffler then speaks to the positive benefits and revelations that change is capable of producing. His case for the essential nature of change is well put though, at best, merely levels the scale between the pros and cons of our collective future.The final bit Toffler falls to a slightly more speculative but entirely theoretical tone in which he discusses some of his own potential solutions to mitigating the worst case social scenarios first presented and to the essential tasks he deemed necessary for our successful, albeit inevitable, march forward in time."

For a solid 75% of the book it’s easy to forget this was published 50 years ago, and then that other 25% makes you appreciate just how uncertain the year 2020 must have been. The most surprising result of reading this was this sense I developed that the world hasn’t really change that much. Sure, we’re technologically more advanced, and we’ve made fairly remarkable progress socially, but many of our stresses are the same. These paragraphs feel like that could have been published this week in a major news outlet:————Great cities are paralyzed by strikes, power failures, riots. International power alliances are shaken. Financial and political leaders secretly tremble--not out of fear that communist (or capitalist) revolutionaries will oust them, but that the entire system is somehow flying out of control.These are indisputable signs of a sick social structure, a society that can no longer perform even its most basic functions in the accustomed ways. It is a society caught in the agony of revolutionary change. In the 1920's and 1930's, communists used to speak of the ""general crisis of capitalism."" It is now clear that they were thinking small. What is occurring now is not a crisis of capitalism, but of industrial society itself, regardless of political form. We are simultaneously experiencing a youth revolution, a sexual revolution, a racial revolution, a colonial revolution, an economic revolution, and the most rapid and deep-going technological revolution in history. We are living through the general crisis of industrialism. In a word, we are in the midst of the super-industrial revolution.—————If the future scares you or excites you...this might be a good book to crack open. Certainly not for everyone though. "

This book influenced my understanding of technology, and helped me better understand the human context of relationships with technology today. Many of the cultural conditions and the relationships with technology in the past, have contributed to and thus can help us better understand our cultural conditions and relationships with technology today. Some of these things from the past that were discussed that I liked most, which help us understand the present:Disposability, consumption culture, and less attachment to specific places and things (we are often relocating for school and work and purchasing cheap new goods rather than repairing expensive existing goods). All of this may contribute to the transience we feel, the psychic pains from which I think we try to avoid through heavy interaction with social media and communication technology with our phones, texts, and emails... which I also think we try to avoid through general stimulation from today's more cheap, accessible modern drugs: video games and pornography.The main point is how the speed of technological change challenges our ability to understand it, process it, and adapt our behavior. Which is why he thinks there should be more attention to how it's shaping our lives in the present and will in the future (more futurists)."

LOOOOLBtw, that book reminds me Futorology Congress by Stanislav Lem, that part about huge building built on seven columns, each of those reflects one of major religions. Lack of classical education makes author to create very sophisticated constructs, like five components: things, place, people, people place in socium and information. Author is trying to analyze everything by applying these five to it, but even failed to structurize his own book within these limitations. But, somehow he is right, life is getting faster, and, not everybody like that. Very noticeable part of that book is a way how author uses and interprets statistical data, very biased -izmish way, but, looks like it is quite common, especially in modern society.The best part of this book is it's name Future Shock, which was derived from Culture Shock, and I found it very lyrical :)Would not say that i like that book at all."

It was a surreal experience reading this - nothing felt shocking and nothing jarred... and then I would remember that he wrote this 47 years ago. For the most part, it is an extraordinary portrayal of the then-future/now-present and the challenges of transience, diversity, novelty and pace that he foresaw in 1970 have come home to roost: the cracks in democratic process, the opportunity for conscious evolution through gene technologies, the ever-increasing weight borne by our social services and education systems to look far enough ahead in order to create infrastructures that will be fit for future purpose.Toffler refers to Future Shock as his diagnosis, claiming ""we cannot begin to help ourselves until we become sensitively conscious of the problem."" He does offer a few solutions in Part 6: Strategies for Survival but these lack the detail and depth of the other five sections of the book.

Secondly, I kept wondering along each chapter why the analysis of the society back in the 70s could still apply half a century later... The main trends around the acceleration of change for all aspects in life (technological, (inter)personal, professional, etc.) are still so valid today that this is almost frightening...What did happen in the meantime?? Didn't the 80s also bring many societal changes? Or the Internet revolution in the late 90s? How come do we have the feeling that changes are still accelerating - and that most of the ""solutions"" proposed in the book could still apply today?This is a book I enjoyed reading, not to finger-point where the author didn't foresee something, but to reflect my own current situation and try to anticipate better the future shock :)"

It was way better than the last nonfiction book I read that was published in 2019.But he kind of lost me towards the end. He fails to predict the internet so he suggests “social assemblies” where everyone participates in decision making. And it’s like nobody has time for that! He doesn’t have a lot of faith in the system, and thinks we need to have all these meetings to predict the future. But if everyone was working to the future we would advance faster. He predicts that we will all be cyborgs in the future, writing in 1970. Then just sort of mentions computers and goes on. But it turns out it is really difficult to engineer medical devices.He does get sex robots right though. Apparently sex robots have been in the making for hundreds of years. Yes, men invented sex dolls as soon as they could. Also he suggests that in addition to History we could have a Future class, which is a good idea."

People keep on chanting ""change"" & ""being agile or you will perish"" kind of stuff. It sounds vague as their arguments remain unidimensional. Future Shock is able to cover all the aspects of humanity undergoing the roller coaster of alterations. It is so fun to read a reader can relate his life, the transition he witnessed around him from childhood to present. The part where my eyes got big was our future. The writer took today's practice and predicted our coming time. It was so convincing as if you are actually a part of it. Sometime readers may feel if the content is getting repeated but patience is the key because every chapter is completely new dimension relating other things. This book will you give extreme clarity about what is currently happening around & how to deal with it.

Half of it could have been cut with none of the content or ideas missing.It wasn't an important part of the book for me, but most of the future predictions were way off the mark - all predictions of the future seem to be far too optimistic in regards to dates. I sometimes wonder if this is something that's done on purpose, especially when selling a book. If you read a book in 1970 and it's predicting things for 2070 when you'll be long dead, you probably won't care as much as if they were predictions for the year 2000, when you'd be alive. I was impressed by his nearly perfect prediction of the Alexa device. I also liked his views on ""overchoice"" and what an issue that would become. I primarily read this to learn a bit more about the issues that can arise when society goes through rapid changes, like we are now, but I wouldn't say I gained a huge amount of insight. To sum the book up, extreme change can trigger lots of negative bodily reactions and it can affect a person's ability to act rationally."

Toffler's decision to analyze then-current events and trends (e.g., countercultural movements and overconsumption of environmental resources) to predict what could happen in super-industrial societies in the next few decades proves insightful. Though Future Shock certainly drags at parts and some parts devolve into strange science fiction fantasies (underwater civilizations? cyborgs?), his analysis is remarkably prescient. I particularly enjoyed when Toffler predicted political and technological developments that we see today, such as the rise of an ideologue urging us to return to the ""glory days"" (Trump, anyone?) and the production of self-expression media, such as podcasts and online video. Future Shock isn't exactly a beach read, but it was well worth the time and effort I put into it. 9/10 stars."

It's amazing how a lot of the concerns and ideas are still relevant today. This is a quick read, however, I have too much read, so have been taking my time. Heavily influenced by Buckminster Fuller, and Toffler does seem to repeat himself often with out saying much in certain subparts of his chapters, but when he comes up with an idea, it strikes. What is wonderful is paging through his bibliography and finding other similar authors and theorists of the era (mid to late 60s) to read or add to the book shelf"

Future Shock, ahead of its time, explores the human socio-economic and psychological understanding and applies it to maximum effect. That at this point, upon reading sentence upon logical sentence, everything could only be nodded and agreed at. Perhaps not all arguments flexed in this book may be fully accurate, but for a book published way back then when these concepts were close to foreign - It makes reading it a delight and would definitely send shivers down your spine."

I've only taken off one star because I feel some of the adaptation strategies towards the future may be kind of lacking, but for a tough book judge like myself 4 stars is a very high rating, therefore I recommend this book if you're on the fence about reading it."

Though it lacks suspense, romance, and those other aspects we are so fond of it fiction work this book takes up the slack with its insightful facts of cultural change. This book, as well as the title, which became a household phrase, is more profound now than in the late sixties. I must read for every human being especially those that pride themselves on there social progressive views toward the advancement of human kind and the planet we inhabit. "

Maybe a revised more contemporary version would be great. Alvin Toffler was certainly unique in his time and visionary. I might reread it or listen to audio version of the book itself. I borrowed this book from a university library upon a recommendation of a previous colleague of mine. I know that English is a second language for me but I reckon the language of the book would feel the same to a millenial natove English speaker."

Written 45 years ago, this concept is still very relevant, maye be even more relevant than in 1970. Book contains interesting concepts and is only occasionaly far of the mark with futuristic predictions.I also liked the concept of adhocracy that will replace bureaucracy; increases adaptability of organizations (I suppose current term would be 'agile') but strains adaptibility of men."

My father recognized having read it decades ago, sniffed out the proceeding 2 books for me to read. I'm not usually prone to pay attention to Futurists but Toffler has a solid of grasp on reality. Never fell off into praising the second coming in the form of a technilogical singularity"
278,0553101501,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34766635-rogerio,5,This book is fantastic. It is hard to believe that Alvin Toffler wrote it in 1970. His analysis of society then and his inferences about the future are so accurate. Not everything developed in the direction he predicted. Nevertheless this book remains a must read. He is brilliant.

282,0553101501,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13459886-yhc,2,"In my previous book Present Shock: When Everything Happens Now that i enjoyed a lot, it mentioned about this very famous book, future shock and i have it with me for long but never got the chance to read it(also all his other books that i will surely read over ). This book was published in 1970, almost 5 decades ago, therefore i read it as a sci-fi futurist book with the touch of Utopian style. Considering it has been almost 50 years old, Toffler got pretty precise prediction on most of the things he predicted in the book, but what i want to mentioned here is the one he failed to predicted and the reality was rather disappointing. Most of his predictions are around society, education, population change, science development, human relationship, companies...etc.1. He didn't mention anything about globalization, I think at that time this is still pretty new. We feel the commerce is going to develop over continents but globally in the way we are today is indeed fast.2. He didn't mention about banking system would actually became such fatal role to control this planet, the repeated financial crisis doesn't teach us to learn lessons.3. The political development was rarely mentioned, he mentioned about socialist democracy but not capitalized communism...who would know that the biggest politically communism, China, embrace capitalism economically so well now.4. During the cold war, Soviet and USA had space race so we sent people to space and to the moon. In this book, Toffler mentioned many times about space development would reach certain level that we will have so ""many"" astronomers actually live in ISS. (heartache!) Who would know that 50 years later, our astronomers only stay on earth orbit, and never set their foot back to the moon. Luckily we have a big dreams soon with SpaceX to go beyond the moon. Let's pack soon to Mars. Am I allowed to dream big before i get old?5. In Toffler's farest dream, he would never know that one day, the war between 2 countries could be like Virtual Reality games. One side with real casualties, the other would remotely control the drone through screen in another side of the earth, after the mission is done, this few people military still can go back home having dinner with their family. (mentioned in my last book Present Shock: When Everything Happens Now ) 6. Far from training dolphins to be our deep sea exploring partners, we exploit their home, pollute their space into continental size of plastic island. Well done Humans! And of course, we hunt dolphins ,whales, and many other kinds of sea animals with big corporation ship that spare-nothing-kind-of-fishing Nets. (wonder why they don't use their super Nets to clean up the plastic island shit instead)7. Genetically modified on Wild animals to be more docile? Why? Toffler? I thought most of them are killed by humans, docile or not, we just invade their home for the sake of humans!8. 24 hours day light thanks to big mirror reflect from space with satellites to light up the dark side of earth. Toffler mentioned about day light needed in winter time of Scandinavia, which is understandable. for plants to grow, yes. But if for the sake of industry 24 hours function, so human also taking shift to keep working. No way.....give this poor ear a break! we have enough stuff that we don't really need but fabricated. I think this book still have many things for us to actually take into consideration, but like i say, the power is in the hands of big corporations, they don't care about what skin colors we are, what political situation you believe, they just want money!! and Money craving is good enough to destroy this world, and that is the biggest shock!"
283,0553101501,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63892286-sheryl-mccoy,5,"It's difficult to rate ""Future Shock"" highly when reading it is like watching the destruction of civilization in slow motion. Yet, the book is a great read...if you think it's science fiction. These events laid out in this book were not BOUND TO HAPPEN, they were FORCED TO HAPPEN, much like the Shadow Wars in Babylon 5. It wasn't destiny, so much as brain-washing, that makes this future a real possibility.""Future Shock"" is one of the first books to lay out how the unscrupulous would use what we now call ""persuasive technology"" to ensure the rise of a corporate feudal system. from the golden age of corporate capitalism where criminal elements within the Nixon government and corporations began to be recognized as NORMAL. If you didn't realize this, you better go back and read ""Future Shock"" and the companion books again. Most people read Toffler's books and see themselves as the ONE who will rise above the dross. Don't be fooled. This book, Future Shock, is one of a set of cookbooks, including ""The Third Wave"", ""Power Shift"" and others that have been used to ""cook up"" a dismal future for most humans. If you aren't IN THE GROUP MAKING THIS HAPPEN, you aren't in...you are among the dross.At one time, I thought Toffler would find people to put on the brakes to this change in worldview, but that never happened. Let me remind you that NONE OF US who use and rely on public online spaces will be in the upper or even midling echelons of future/present/past feudal leaders. Some politicians like Newt Gingrich and others helped Toffler create this new world through the various laws and groups who control the ""confused"" majority. It's highly unlikely that those of us who saw it all along will make much of a dent in stopping it. When I read Future Shock, I was also reading a great many other books which aligned with the future or aligned with this book in science fiction. It took me a decade before I figured out that this man was laying out A REAL PLAN to put most of us (the 99%) into a state of modern servitude where governments and constitutions of the 2oth century have fallen. The independent person had fallen. There is no fiction here. Think of this plan as an explanation of how Huxley's ""Brave New World"" could come into existence.It seems to me that Toffler's writing style was very engaging, yet alarming in the way he spoke of a return to a recognizable feudal state. A CORPORATE feudal state was described and honored by Toffler. I remember wondering if this could be resisted. I learned that it could not. From the late 1980's until Toffler's death, I watched as he wrote less for a public audience and more for a nouveau feudal ruling class. He and his wife gave conferences and developed relationships with ""leaders"" to maximize ways to create the new corporate feudal system. It seemed to me that he and his wife were glad to be plugged into the process of turning the majority of humans into corporate serfs. I remember one part of his first book included warnings that you would not be able to resist. If you did resist, you would be completely locked out of the corporate-based feudal world. This meant that personal ownership outside the corporate feudal systems would eventually disappear, unless you had some value to the overlords. Take these books for what you will. If you're confused, don't worry...you are just where Toffler and his minions knew you would be."
284,0553101501,http://goodreads.com/user/show/98347967-john,5,"2020 marks 50 years since Future Shock was first published. As a book about the future and how to adapt to its inevitable change it was an interesting time to read it. Due to the fact that I am 50 years removed from the world in which it was written in I am given a very different mindset to read it in. My enjoyment of the book comes partially from looking back with 2020 hindsight and partially from finding its original message still relevant today. The introductory chapters of this book explain just how fast our society started moving in the 20th century. Compared to today this rate of advancement has only increased in acceleration. 1970 marks one of the earliest generations to notice how fast information moves and how quick things can change. I can only imagine how intense this period must have been as no other period of human history progress at the pace of the first 70 years of the 20th century, at that point.A lot of the first half of the book discusses many of the trends of 1970. Toffler projects how changes that happened in the prior half of the 20th century will affect the years after. It was great to see what was seen as revolutionary or points of interest to a person of this time. As someone who finds the 20th century to be one of the most interesting points of history to study, a lot of this book was a pleasure to read. There is a wide variety of subjects covered in this book. Because of this some chapters might interest certain readers more than others. By covering all of these trends the book can feel like it is part history, sociology, philosophy, anthropology, futurist, and business. As a business school graduate some of the chapters on consumer trends were great insight into marketing knowledge of the day, even if some of the information is rudimentary today.Toffler makes many speculations about the future and surprisingly a lot of them turn out to have become true. Granted there are a few subjects he misses on but they are still fun to read about, they just feel more sci-fi than realistic.The overall message of Future Shock is to address the trend of rapid change that forces human beings obsolete if they don't know how to adapt with the changes and learn current information. He offers so many great insights and the fact that they are still relevant really shows how this book is still useful to read today. That being said, reading this 50 years on and realizing not that much has changed is a depressing thought. If more people had read this book back then and incorporated its message into their lives maybe we'd have solve more of societies issues. Its also ironic that many of the people who would have been youth at the point of publishing this book are now the elder, ruling class, failing to adapt to our current world, holding us back. Maybe this is just part of the human condition and it is inevitable that we will fail future generations.Overall I would recommend anyone looking for insight into life during 1970 as well as a better way of looking at the future to read this book. It is well worth it."
285,0553101501,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20926327-lora-shouse,4,"When I was in college Future Shock was all over the shelves at the bookstore and everywhere. Obviously, I should have read it then. A least I could have added it to my book list; I hadn’t closed the first list at that time. But honestly, I don’t know when I would have had the time to read it. And anyway, there were other things I was more interested in at the time.When I was putting books on my second list years later, it occurred to me that I hadn’t ever read Future Shock, and, somewhat surprised that it was still around, I added it to the list at that time. So, now I have finally read it.The first three-quarters of the book or so are pretty fun. Toffler surveys some of the rapidly multiplying different ways of living that were coming into being or looked about to be coming into being and looks at the consequences of too much (or too little) change at one time. At close to fifty years later, I can say that much of what he predicted has in fact happened. I can’t vouch for every little thing he talked about, but he was right on the money about a lot of things like corporate mindset and changes in work – I have lived through a lot of exactly what he was talking about.I’m not sure the pace of change ever got to quite what he expected it to. It was, and still is, plenty fast, mind you, and for those people living on the cutting edge of change all the time I’m sure plenty have and still do experience the negative effects he pointed out. Maybe the increase in the rate of change finally got to a point where it could not keep continuing. Maybe factors such as the environmental movement began to act as kind of a drag on the pace of some kinds of changes. Maybe a large proportion of the population was just not able to change that fast. Anyway, I don’t think that the rate of change ever got quite as out-of-hand as he thought it might. At least not yet.The last quarter of the book, where he talks about what we can do to buffer ourselves against the worst of future shock is a little more boring. A lot of this is suggestions for suggestions. Some of it has been tried, at least on a limited basis. Occasionally cities will get together a planning group to try to plan out some aspects of their future – like what to do about transportation or jobs or living space. But I don’t think this has ever been done very extensively on a national or global level, or very often even on a more local level. And I’m not sure anybody knows how to educate children for a future that we don’t even know what it is yet.This was a library book."
286,0553101501,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12083674-michael-david,5,"When this book was written during the 1970s, the world was at the brink of a technological big bang. Alvin Toffler noticed the signs. He wrote about the signs and elaborated upon them in this book, Future Shock. 'Future shock' was the term he coined for the disease that would afflict unprepared individuals in the future. If I can describe the book in one word, it would be comprehensive. His treatise is full of corroborative references: in fact, 80 pages of the book are all his references. Notable among his points is that more knowledge has been accrued in the past fifty years than in the time between the 15th and 19th century. Among the important points in his treatise is the idea of transience pervading over our everyday lives. Everything is transient - not only things and places, but more importantly, even knowledge and people.In addition, the future also brings with it much novelty and an infinity of choices. Through numerous examples, Toffler claims that it is the lack of rootedness and the difficulty of choice that drives a lot of people towards a breakdown. Given what I perceive nowadays, it's impressive that Toffler was generally right. He had accurately predicted the irascibility of humans at this day and age: millennials nowadays have girlfriends or boyfriends as young as the age of ten; teenage pregnancies are becoming more and more common, and the lack of stability and rootedness within the family and society has fragmented less robust families. One shortcoming from Toffler's book was his inability to predict the repercussions of the personal computer. Because he was unable to predict the advent of the PC through the efforts of pioneers like Wozniak, Gates, and Jobs, he, in effect was conservative in his estimates. The personal computer drastically optimized the speed of new technologies entering our society and culture. The increased speed in computation transformed society, both positively and negatively: while we have information and knowledge at our fingertips, with ease of access, we also have developmentally delayed four-year old children whose tablets have become substitutes for creativity. Well, I guess Toffler was right all along: future shock has arrived. "
287,0553101501,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4872710-eric-swanson,3,"Was a crystal ball for society and technology.Alvin's insights in this book included many accurate predictions for how society would engage and embrace technology in the past future. The book is an easy read with points that continue to have some resonance.Have you ever felt that change was coming too fast and frequently? This is a core tenant of Future Shock, written in a time when computer technology was new, adapting, and accelerating; where technology innovation continues presently. Alvin suggests that society and individuals must be willing to adapt as crucial criteria for success. He highlights that organizations and the world itself will adopt more fluid, shifting structures and interactions based on enabling technology. The internet as well as personal devices today are perfect examples for the fluid nature of how our social, professional and personal interactions with technology are tightly intertwined. However, he warns of the importance in striking a balance between real-world ""actual"" interactions and virtual ""vicarious"" experiences. We have all seen negative effects of technology and social engagement in our lives and communities that usually stem from assumptions that our digital or ""virtual"" experiences are not the same as in real life, leading to communications and actions that would otherwise never occur. He goes further to suggest that we must identify and develop personal ""stability zones"" that nurture our personal connections to one another or risk getting lost along the way, such as maintaining a healthy diet, exercise and leisure with strong, intimate relationships.Alvin successfully predicts that success supported by technology would necessitate invention simply to remain competitive while also emphasizing the important role of collaborative governance among businesses and governments as new technology is developed and introduced. He also correctly forecasts product variety and consumer choice as a result of all of this technology creation."
288,0553101501,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4876036-mitch-anderson,3,"Ignore the year of publication and rest assured — you’re sure to learn something of interest from Alvin Toffler’s Future Shock. Outside of a few dated terms, much of what Toffler speaks to — the social, economic, political, and technological trends of the past, present and future — are addressed through their functional and affective aspects rather than broad speculation over the physical forms and precise implementations to which they are to take. For a book written in 1970, there’s still plenty of relevant information in here to think about.Toffler begins by giving us a broad overview of the state of contemporary society as it stood just as the USA’s golden age was coming to a close. Much of the initial chapters provide overviews of the sociological and psychosocial viewpoints of an uprooted and hyperactive tech-enabled “technosociety” (one of a few dated terms). Touching on the subjects of alienation, grounding, values and belief systems, a la carte lifestyles, political representation and knowledge, Toffler leaves no stone unturned as he exposes to us to the stark realities of the social dysfunction already well underway at the time of publication. Though it paints a rather bleak image of the future, much of what he speaks to remains entirely relevant today.Following the bleak evaluation of the foreseeable future insofar as he sees it, Toffler then speaks to the positive benefits and revelations that change is capable of producing. His case for the essential nature of change is well put though, at best, merely levels the scale between the pros and cons of our collective future.The final bit Toffler falls to a slightly more speculative but entirely theoretical tone in which he discusses some of his own potential solutions to mitigating the worst case social scenarios first presented and to the essential tasks he deemed necessary for our successful, albeit inevitable, march forward in time."
289,0553101501,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22452050-john,4,"3.5/5 — Shocking how many areas Toffler got right about the future. For a solid 75% of the book it’s easy to forget this was published 50 years ago, and then that other 25% makes you appreciate just how uncertain the year 2020 must have been. The most surprising result of reading this was this sense I developed that the world hasn’t really change that much. Sure, we’re technologically more advanced, and we’ve made fairly remarkable progress socially, but many of our stresses are the same. These paragraphs feel like that could have been published this week in a major news outlet:————Great cities are paralyzed by strikes, power failures, riots. International power alliances are shaken. Financial and political leaders secretly tremble--not out of fear that communist (or capitalist) revolutionaries will oust them, but that the entire system is somehow flying out of control.These are indisputable signs of a sick social structure, a society that can no longer perform even its most basic functions in the accustomed ways. It is a society caught in the agony of revolutionary change. In the 1920's and 1930's, communists used to speak of the ""general crisis of capitalism."" It is now clear that they were thinking small. What is occurring now is not a crisis of capitalism, but of industrial society itself, regardless of political form. We are simultaneously experiencing a youth revolution, a sexual revolution, a racial revolution, a colonial revolution, an economic revolution, and the most rapid and deep-going technological revolution in history. We are living through the general crisis of industrialism. In a word, we are in the midst of the super-industrial revolution.—————If the future scares you or excites you...this might be a good book to crack open. Certainly not for everyone though. "

This book influenced my understanding of technology, and helped me better understand the human context of relationships with technology today. Many of the cultural conditions and the relationships with technology in the past, have contributed to and thus can help us better understand our cultural conditions and relationships with technology today. Some of these things from the past that were discussed that I liked most, which help us understand the present:Disposability, consumption culture, and less attachment to specific places and things (we are often relocating for school and work and purchasing cheap new goods rather than repairing expensive existing goods). All of this may contribute to the transience we feel, the psychic pains from which I think we try to avoid through heavy interaction with social media and communication technology with our phones, texts, and emails... which I also think we try to avoid through general stimulation from today's more cheap, accessible modern drugs: video games and pornography.The main point is how the speed of technological change challenges our ability to understand it, process it, and adapt our behavior. Which is why he thinks there should be more attention to how it's shaping our lives in the present and will in the future (more futurists)."

I found that author is merely affected by sexizm, racizm and many other -izms, noticeable even for my russian origin. I am wondering, was it that bad at USA back in seventies? LOOOOLBtw, that book reminds me Futorology Congress by Stanislav Lem, that part about huge building built on seven columns, each of those reflects one of major religions. Lack of classical education makes author to create very sophisticated constructs, like five components: things, place, people, people place in socium and information. Author is trying to analyze everything by applying these five to it, but even failed to structurize his own book within these limitations. But, somehow he is right, life is getting faster, and, not everybody like that. Very noticeable part of that book is a way how author uses and interprets statistical data, very biased -izmish way, but, looks like it is quite common, especially in modern society.The best part of this book is it's name Future Shock, which was derived from Culture Shock, and I found it very lyrical :)Would not say that i like that book at all."

It was a surreal experience reading this - nothing felt shocking and nothing jarred... and then I would remember that he wrote this 47 years ago. For the most part, it is an extraordinary portrayal of the then-future/now-present and the challenges of transience, diversity, novelty and pace that he foresaw in 1970 have come home to roost: the cracks in democratic process, the opportunity for conscious evolution through gene technologies, the ever-increasing weight borne by our social services and education systems to look far enough ahead in order to create infrastructures that will be fit for future purpose.Toffler refers to Future Shock as his diagnosis, claiming ""we cannot begin to help ourselves until we become sensitively conscious of the problem."" He does offer a few solutions in Part 6: Strategies for Survival but these lack the detail and depth of the other five sections of the book. It's a thought-provoking read when you consider his foresight and wonder who today will portray our future 50 years out with similar prescience."

As I came across it on a bookshelf, even if in French, I started reading it asap.And I wasn't disappointed: first, the translation is absolutely perfect - hats off! Secondly, I kept wondering along each chapter why the analysis of the society back in the 70s could still apply half a century later... The main trends around the acceleration of change for all aspects in life (technological, (inter)personal, professional, etc.) are still so valid today that this is almost frightening...What did happen in the meantime?? Didn't the 80s also bring many societal changes? Or the Internet revolution in the late 90s? How come do we have the feeling that changes are still accelerating - and that most of the ""solutions"" proposed in the book could still apply today?This is a book I enjoyed reading, not to finger-point where the author didn't foresee something, but to reflect my own current situation and try to anticipate better the future shock :)"

It was way better than the last nonfiction book I read that was published in 2019.But he kind of lost me towards the end. He fails to predict the internet so he suggests “social assemblies” where everyone participates in decision making. And it’s like nobody has time for that! He doesn’t have a lot of faith in the system, and thinks we need to have all these meetings to predict the future. But if everyone was working to the future we would advance faster. He predicts that we will all be cyborgs in the future, writing in 1970. Then just sort of mentions computers and goes on. But it turns out it is really difficult to engineer medical devices.He does get sex robots right though. Apparently sex robots have been in the making for hundreds of years. Yes, men invented sex dolls as soon as they could. Also he suggests that in addition to History we could have a Future class, which is a good idea."

People keep on chanting ""change"" & ""being agile or you will perish"" kind of stuff. It sounds vague as their arguments remain unidimensional. Future Shock is able to cover all the aspects of humanity undergoing the roller coaster of alterations. It is so fun to read a reader can relate his life, the transition he witnessed around him from childhood to present. The part where my eyes got big was our future. The writer took today's practice and predicted our coming time. It was so convincing as if you are actually a part of it. Sometime readers may feel if the content is getting repeated but patience is the key because every chapter is completely new dimension relating other things. This book will you give extreme clarity about what is currently happening around & how to deal with it. I am literally forcing my close one to read this book and looking forward to reading other books of Alvin Toffler."

Half of it could have been cut with none of the content or ideas missing.It wasn't an important part of the book for me, but most of the future predictions were way off the mark - all predictions of the future seem to be far too optimistic in regards to dates. I sometimes wonder if this is something that's done on purpose, especially when selling a book. If you read a book in 1970 and it's predicting things for 2070 when you'll be long dead, you probably won't care as much as if they were predictions for the year 2000, when you'd be alive. I was impressed by his nearly perfect prediction of the Alexa device. I also liked his views on ""overchoice"" and what an issue that would become. I primarily read this to learn a bit more about the issues that can arise when society goes through rapid changes, like we are now, but I wouldn't say I gained a huge amount of insight. To sum the book up, extreme change can trigger lots of negative bodily reactions and it can affect a person's ability to act rationally."

Toffler's decision to analyze then-current events and trends (e.g., countercultural movements and overconsumption of environmental resources) to predict what could happen in super-industrial societies in the next few decades proves insightful. Though Future Shock certainly drags at parts and some parts devolve into strange science fiction fantasies (underwater civilizations? cyborgs?), his analysis is remarkably prescient. I particularly enjoyed when Toffler predicted political and technological developments that we see today, such as the rise of an ideologue urging us to return to the ""glory days"" (Trump, anyone?) and the production of self-expression media, such as podcasts and online video. Future Shock isn't exactly a beach read, but it was well worth the time and effort I put into it. 9/10 stars."
