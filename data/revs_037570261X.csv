0,037570261X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/858949-chris,3,"I've read this story before, many times. The interesting thing is how different each approach is to telling the story of the appearance and evolution of life on Earth. Carl Sagan approaches it with reverent awe, one of the Universe's great mysteries. Bill Bryson, on the other hand, took an outsider's view, since he is not really ""in"" on the whole paleontology thing. And Terry Pratchett and his buddies told the tale through the eyes of the Wizards of the Unseen University, which always makes things interesting.Fortey's approach is somewhat different. He got into this by being a student of the Ancient, and has been studying the history of life since his boyhood. So, his take on the story is one of excited discovery. He does a very nice job at explaining just how thrilling it is to find a fossil tooth in a place where no one had found fossil teeth before, or why the fact that chalk is made of countless billions of dead sea creatures is cause for wonder.He was thrilled to find his first trilobite back when he was fourteen, and the thrill has never worn off. It is a testament to his talent that he is able to transmit that enthusiasm and love of the science to his writing. He takes us through the four billion years of life's evolution, keeping it interesting whether its the miracle of the cell or the miracle of the Homo sapiens diaspora.If you're interested in how you got here - and you want to kick some ""intelligent design"" nutbars in the ass - you'll enjoy this book."
1,037570261X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1856764-kristen,5,"Great book but as much as I enjoyed it I'd recommend one of his more recent books instead. Fortey is one of those rare science writers that combines a gift for explanation with the rare feat of being a great writer and often invokes a Saganesque beauty of science. His description of tetrapods wandering across Pangaea as 'perfectly pandemic perambulation' and his constant inclusion of numberless quotes of fine literature and poetry sucks the reader in (in a way another British science author, who shall not be named, has always failed miserly at.)  The religious language used in chapter two and in the conclusion as a means to show how an acceptance of science need not contradict ones beliefs was, I admit, a bit distasteful for a godless heathen like myself, but it's all for a good cause, is brief and is done is a way tasteful enough to make me consider giving this book to my science-hostile friends in hopes that Fortey can win them over.  The thing I like best is Fortey's rather valiant attempt to give each period of geologic time the attention it deserves rather than concentrating on what is only most interesting to us humans and focusing on that disproportionately. Sure, most science books I've read mention how single-cell life makes up most of our biologic history and how very long the process of oxygenation of the atmosphere really took but it's always a fleeting mention whereas Fortey really makes you feel and appreciate the long passage of time these things entail. Fortey has a gift for really fleshing out the history of life on Earth and really making one appreciate the immense scale of geologic time in a way most pop science books do not. "
2,037570261X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8079403-max,4,"Fortey, an exceptionally engaging science writer, takes us on a tour through four billion years of natural history. His review is neither focused nor comprehensive but more of a wide ranging travelogue touching on each period in evolutionary history and the author’s explorations. The high points are his evocative descriptions of landforms, flora and fauna both present and past. We traverse the terrain with him on his fossil collecting expeditions to remote corners of the world where he describes what the earth and its inhabitants must have looked like in eras long ago. For example, he takes your imagination to a primitive Carboniferous forest with giant millipedes and dragon flies as big as seagulls. Fortey discusses the process and history of paleontology as he describes the progression of the flora and fauna through time. He includes his own personal experience and that of other paleontologists. It’s a big topic and a short book so Fortey offers up selected bite sized portions of the activity of each era. He describes the cyanobacteria and microbes that formed floating mats in the ocean 3,000 million years ago (mya) leaving their vestiges in fossilized stromatolites. Then he moves onto the Cambrian period (520 mya), its explosion of multicellular life and his personal specialty, trilobites, about which he has a separate book. So we get good coverage of these extinct arthropods along with graptolites and other creatures that prospered in the Ordovician. After 60% of marine species expire at the end of the Ordovician (443 mya), Fortey moves on to the Silurian when bony fish proliferate and plants and animals invade the coasts, streams and rivers ending with the conquest of land in the Devonian . Sadly a late Devonian extinction (375 mya) left only one order of Forty’s beloved trilobites. Fortey then gives us a succinct overview of the dinosaurs and their demise in the Permian extinction (250 mya) which also took out the last trilobite after a 270 million year run. Lastly he covers mammals that interest him including hominids right up to the Neanderthals and Homo sapiens.While a fun quick spin through the eras, I do have some quibbles. It’s difficult to keep track of the flow of life from period to period amidst Fortey’s frequent diversions into the history of fossil discovery and his personal expeditions. Also, he often refers just to the period name without dates. I found myself going on line frequently to be sure I had the time periods and their creatures in proper relation to each other. The book lacks time line charts, an odd omission, although it has many excellent pictures of specimens and locations. His use of extended analogies often seems contrived. In one case he compares the rise and demise of animals in the ecosystem to the changes in orchestras as new instruments appeared and old ones disappeared over the centuries. In another he compares the ever increasing size of dinosaurs to the trend of ever bigger black pepper grinders in Italian restaurants. I would have been happier with less fluff. Still I enjoyed the book. Other readers may find his style a welcome relief from books that can overwhelm with one scientific detail after another. "
3,037570261X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9246169-wanda,5,"I love the combination of autobiography and science in this book. I love Richard Fortey's writing style and I appreciate his sense of humour. Because of this book, I still have a strong desire to see Spitzbergen! I have always loved paleontology and use this book as a basis for the teaching that I have done on the subject.I have found it a very useful starting point for further research on the fossils which catch my attention. It is starting to show its age, as science moves on and a lot has been discovered since the book's publication, but it still provides a thoughtful history of life on earth."
4,037570261X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2613753-eric,5,"My brother realizes I am a paleontology geek, so I was hooked to ""Life"" the moment I picked it up! Like Fortey, I revel in the minutiae of life's march through the ages, from the Pre Cambian, Ediacarian fauna Spriggina, a possible precursor to trilobites, to the effects of bolides, which will really ruin your day. "
5,037570261X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5855603-darrin,5,"This is my second book by Richard Fortey, retired paleontologist and science writer. I complained in the past about Fortey's flowery writing style but once I settle into his books, I find myself enjoying it so I am not going to take any stars away. For a science writer, he puts a lot of effort into his use of english to write what I find to be very engrossing science books about one of my favorite subjects, paleontology.I liked that the book focused on the little stuff...the microorganisms that transformed the earth during the proterozoic and the slow evolution of larger organisms in the oceans and the latter movement onto land that ended in the permian. This incredibly long time period encapsulating many millions of years in geologic time is really what set the stage for everything that came after. Dinosaurs, mammals and ultimately humans are not covered as extensively but still get their due.I own a copy of a large format picture book published by Dorling Kindersley titled Prehistoric Life: The Definitive Visual History of Life on Earth. I found it very useful to follow along in this picture book as I read Life. Fortey's chapters roughly covered geological time periods...ordovician, devonian, etc...which is how Prehistoric Life is laid out as well. It was enlightening to see the actual fossils Fortey describes and just added to what I learned about this time period in earth's history.A thoroughly enjoyable overview of life on earth."
6,037570261X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,3,"This isn't my favourite of Fortey's books, possibly because I've read similar types of books by other writers before, so he isn't bringing me a new subject I don't expect to like in the same way as he was in his books about geology, or a key passion of his as in his book about trilobites (though trilobites have their place here, too, as you'd expect with Fortey). Still, I enjoy the way he writes and the way he draws together his themes, and this isn't a bad book -- it's just that he and others have covered a lot of this ground before.Actually, my favourite history-of-evolution type book is Richard Dawkins' The Ancestor's Tale. (When Dawkins sticks to science, he's great. When he decides to comment on twitter, rarely so.) That's just a quirk of the way he organises it, though, while Fortey's method is a little less organised, lingering on things of special interest to him. Which is fine, but didn't work so well for me in this case. That, and he doesn't deal with DNA as much as I'd like, because that's my special interest and not his.Nonetheless, Fortey knows his stuff and how to make it enjoyable, though I think I can understand people who complain about his writing style not being easy -- I tend to take it slow and savour it, myself."
7,037570261X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3082950-tomislav,3,"Like Richard Fortey, one of my own first experiences of the full biography of life on Earth was Disney’s animation of Igor Stravinsky’s Rite of Spring, in the film Fantasia. This book is a more accurate and complete version of the same. At the time he wrote this, Fortey was a senior paleontologist at the Natural History Museum in London, and a frequent BBC guest. I had previously read his Horseshoe Crabs and Velvet Worms: The Story of the Animals and Plants That Time Has Left Behind (US title), and enjoyed it enough to seek out this earlier and more foundational book.More than the story told by paleontology, this book is also the story of paleontology, with Fortey relating his personal experiences and perspectives on various episodes in the history of the field. Chapters are arranged chronologically, starting with the inception of life on Earth four billion years ago, moving through his own specialization during and around the Ordovician Period, up to just before the onset of recorded history. As you might expect, his writing is best when working in those fascinating undersea and early terrestrial worlds of the Cambrian through Permian Periods of the Paleozoic Era. Outside that area of his passion, the origins of life are better explained and understood from the perspective of molecular biology. And after those periods, he acknowledges the intense popular fascination with dinosaurs and early humans and turns more to stories of the paleontologists themselves – and he is someone to know them.All together it is a thorough, if light, overview. One shortcoming is that the book is now 23 years old, and state-of-the-understanding has changed in a few areas. The other is his showy style of writing. I think he must see himself as an entertaining polymath, drawing frequent references to classical literature of the British educated class. I speak the American dialect of the same language, and do not share that background. I’m aware of the references, but they are just not the touchstone for me that they must be for his audience. In summary, I appreciated the book, but I did not find it as fascinating as his book on fossil species that have survived with only small adaptation into modern times."
8,037570261X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11030012-jade,3,"With  Life: An Unauthorized Biography, British palaeontologist Richard Fortey attempts to pen down four billion years of life and evolution on earth for his readers in only 400 pages total. An ambitious aim, to be sure, and one that Fortey manages to live up to, though perhaps not in ways everybody might’ve expected (and there’s no doubt that he’s had to sacrifice a large amount of detail in order to fit four billion years into 400 pages).First and foremost, this is in no way a book that can be considered an academic textbook, since Fortey spends a lot of time weaving his own story as a beginning scientist through his tales of life’s history. I didn’t find this annoying or distracting, because I enjoyed the wonderment and enthusiasm it brought me via his own personal experiences, especially when he starts detailing his first big findings and expeditions. However, I can imagine that some readers, especially those with more advanced knowledge of the field, might be looking for something more than the image of a joyous young Fortey digging up his first trilobite. In short, something in a format closer to that of a textbook or a scientific book, giving more information and scrapping a lot of the autobiographical parts.I didn’t mind this though, and thought it brought a lot of life (no pun intended) to the book. Fortey’s style of writing was quite accessible, and his passion and enthusiasm for his own field of work managed to spark my interest even more as I read on. Very engaging, though I did have problems with the fact that Fortey always refers to practically every single species that turns up by its Latin name, sometimes without explaining what the life form in question actually is (or in a very vague manner). And I, being the “… curious and intelligent but perhaps mildly uninformed reader” that’s described on the back cover of my edition (with emphasis on the ‘uninformed’), couldn’t always keep up with this. It led to many frustrated look-ups, and made me wonder: why do this if curious yet uninformed people are your aimed audience?Another thing that bothered me is that Fortey doesn’t provide any information on scientists and/or researchers other than himself who have had a hand in providing the information that we now have on the origin and development of life. Along with the references and sources that, well, simply weren’t present, this felt like something that was truly missing from the book.Anyhow, let’s get back to the other good parts, shall we? I liked both style and most of the general substance in this book, and was particularly smitten with the chapters on the very earliest stages of life, and those on dinosaurs. Throughout this entire book, Fortey also stresses the importance of the fossil record, and how much we can actually learn from it. I also thought the links he made to plate tectonics to be superb, but I might be a little biased here since that is one of my own favourite topics.In conclusion, I thought this was a solid read and I think Fortey was brave when attempting to write something like this. Though near impossible, he sincerely tries to provide his audience with as many details as he can within the confines of 400 pages, yet ultimately fails a little in this goal. His enthusiasm was catching, I enjoyed the book wholeheartedly, and would recommend it to anyone looking for a book on life’s history with an autobiographical tone. "
9,037570261X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8651789-carlos,5,"An absolutely fantastic book that I would recommend to everyone, everywhere, from late high school on. Fortey turns entire epochs into captivating stories that make me immediately want more. His exploration of the Ordovician and Carboniferous were particularly captivating. Being a 1998 book, there were a few things that seemed dated, but none of those small issues took away from the sweeping magnitude of the overall story. Should particularly be required to be read by anyone you hear espousing creationist, ""intelligent design"", other flat earth nonsense. I might start this again right now... "
10,037570261X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/962442-susan-hanberry,5,"Very well-written. Very literate writer. I didn't learn much new about the topic, but the writing is so beautiful it was a lovely review."
11,037570261X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7261574-jordan-venn,5,It sprawls a little but it's a great history of life and had some really beautiful and thoughtful moments. One of my favourite all-time books. 
12,037570261X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10952276-deborah-cordes,5,"Beautifully written, informative, and evocative. I've never read Fortey before, and I will add his newer works to my ""to do"" list. "
13,037570261X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/89796323-viktoria-tomcheva,5,"To many Americans, and nearly all young ones, paleontology can be summed up in one word: dinosaurs. Amid all the current dinomania, in fact, it is easy to forget that the dinosaurs constitute only one small chapter of the history of life, which is filled with countless tales of creatures equally engaging, if not as large. This imbalance is skillfully redressed in Richard Fortey's ''Life: A Natural History of the First Four Billion Years of Life on Earth,'' an account of the history of life incorporating much of the latest research. Surprisingly, this is the first popular but scholarly narrative of life's history written by a professional (Fortey is a paleontologist at the Natural History Museum in London).By filling this empty niche Fortey performs a valuable service, for to understand evolution we must begin with the facts of life, the biological history of earth. His tale is not a boring slog through the strata, but an eclectic waltz among organisms at once extraordinary and extinct, the ''endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful'' admired by Darwin in ''The Origin of Species.'' With a deep understanding of his science, extensive experience prospecting for fossils and considerable writing skills, Fortey brings to life not only dinosaurs and fossils of human ancestors but also less renowned creatures like bear-sized rodents, dragonflies with five-foot wingspans and carnivorous kangaroos.Reconstructing the slow process of evolution is not an easy job, but paleontologists occupy an advantageous position. While other students struggle to understand evolution by observing living species, paleontologists have a direct window on the history of life. For them, evolution is written in the rocks. Their work is plagued, however, with its own special difficulties. As Fortey notes, fossils represent a biased and eccentric sample of life's story. Fragile, squishy, or land-dwelling organisms are less likely to be preserved than heavier-boned or marine creatures, and much of the fossil record is either buried too deep for access or has been destroyed by the endless churning of the earth's crust. It has been estimated that fewer than 1 percent of all the species that ever lived are known to us through fossils.Despite these problems, the past two decades have brought rapid prog-ress in understanding the development of life. Fortey does not merely recite this history chronologically; he focuses on recent, major evolutionary finds. These include a remarkable series showing the evolution of whales from their terrestrial ancestors, and evidence for an ''arms race'' that occurred 150 million years ago when the sudden rise of a fierce array of marine predators -- including venomous octopods, drilling snails and shell-crushing crabs and fish -- touched off a round of defensive adaptations in their helpless prey.Fortey enhances his basic story with many asides, including lessons on relevant aspects of geology (such as continental drift and the dating of rocks), entertaining portraits of eccentric paleontologists and many tales of his experiences on fossil digs throughout the world. The book opens with a long and lively account of his first expedition, a six-month trip to the island of Spitsbergen, during which numbing cold, bad food and personal squabbles all but prevented his team from mining a rare cache of 500-million-year-old Ordovician fossils. Among biologists, field ecologists tend to be seen as ''tough guys,'' forever grappling with lions or pythons in obscure parts of the world. Now, however, I have a new respect for paleontologists as they engage in their own perpetual battles with unforgiving rock.Finally, Fortey details many recent controversies in paleontology, including the debate about the demise of the dinosaurs. Here he provides a much-needed correction of Stephen Jay Gould's famous conclusions about the creatures of the Burgess Shale, an area of the Canadian Rockies rich in fossils. In his book ''Wonderful Life,'' Gould portrays these bizarre animals as victims of ''bad luck'' who died without issue, bolstering his view that much of present life reflects a blind and random pruning of an earlier and vastly more diverse world. As Fortey notes, Burgess Shale animals are now known to be forerunners of existing species, undermining Gould's claim that if evolution were replayed, the vagaries of chance would populate the modern world with creatures substantially different from those we know.While Fortey has corrected some of Gould's scientific conclusions, he has also borrowed some of his literary tendencies. Just as museums have evolved from places of science to palaces of entertainment (a trend loudly decried by Fortey), so popular writing on evolution has developed from spare but gracefully descriptive prose to the jazzed-up style favored by Gould, studded with digressions, rhetorical flourishes and obscure literary allusions. Fortey has obviously been influenced by this trend, and while his tangential material often spices up the text, it occasionally makes the book hard to digest. Exercised by some particularly juicy fossil, Fortey sometimes lapses into overheated prose, extended metaphors (including an unfortunate comparison of evolutionary arms races to the increasing size of pepper mills in Italian restaurants), or breezy but annoying interpolations (dilating on the persistence of an ancient plant, he suddenly exclaims ''Live and let liverwort!''). The text, though eminently readable, would have been improved by including more bones and fewer bon mots.The weakest chapter is the penultimate one, describing human evolution and the rise of society. This is well-trodden ground that has received better coverage in several recent books. After telling the tale of hominids, still subject to much controversy, Fortey cannot resist a detour into philosophical territory. He concludes that two features set us apart from all other animals: our consciousness and our ability to deceive other members of our species. Both claims are dubious. Although consciousness is a thorny problem, many behaviorists have concluded that it is widespread in primates and other animals. Moreover, members of many species deceive their fellows. Some male fish, for example, pretend to be female in appearance and behavior, a deception that allows them to approach spawning males and steal their mates.Because it is largely a recitation of facts, ''Life'' lacks the intellectual challenge that permeates some popular accounts of evolution; readers weaned on the writings of Gould or Richard Dawkins may feel the need for thicker gruel. While the book dwells on the products of evolution and not the forces producing them, much of the attraction of paleontology lies in pondering the mechanisms driving the process. Readers wanting a fuller picture should follow the ingestion of ''Life'' with a digestif of Dawkins, who has written several absorbing books on the power of natural selection.Nevertheless, no one can finish ''Life'' without having accrued considerable knowledge of evolutionary history and a sense of the excitement of discovery that can be conveyed only by a professional scientist chipping away at the rock face of his discipline. Anyone with the slightest interest in biology should read this book, pass it along to those who think that paleontology begins and ends with dinosaurs and then reflect on the many other curious creatures that, as part of the missing 99 percent of the history of life, will be forever unknown to us."
14,037570261X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7324264-john,4,"Richard Fortey has almost done the impossible, describing in vivid, elegant prose, the history of life on Earth in a mere 322 pages. Yet I fear he gives too cursory a treatment; one which have benefited immensely from including additional drawings, diagrams, and perhaps, photographs, offering readers more visual insights on Planet Earth's rich biological history. Among his finest achievements are his excellent descriptions of cladistics as an important methodological tool for classifying animal species and higher taxa (The best I've read in popular science literature so far.), the role of plate tectonics in influencing the history of life, dinosaurs, and the terminal Cretaceous mass extinction which killed off non-avian dinosaurs. Although his professional specialty is invertebrate paleobiology, Fortey does an admirable job describing the conquest of the land by plants and arthropods and the terrestrial reptilian and mammalian faunas which follow. I also commend his frequent insights on the history of paleontology, offering interesting vignettes which give readers an inside look on paleontology as a profession. He opens with an introductory chapter about his graduate education that ought to appeal to anyone thinking of pursuing paleontology as a vocation. It's cast in vivid, exciting prose that could be drawn from the pages of a bestselling thriller. Yet there are some major omissions. Fortey dismisses or ignores the important contributions of University of Chicago paleontologists David Raup and the late Jack Sepkoski in transforming paleontology into a more rigorous, statistically oriented science. And he ignores major contributions from other important American paleontologists such as Niles Eldredge (However, he does cite Eldredge in his bibliography.), George Gaylord Simpson, and Steven M. Stanley, to name but a few, in favor of those from Great Britain. Judging from Fortey's comments, you might think that Stephen Jay Gould was the most important 20th Century American paleontologist. So anyone who thinks that this is simultaneously an excellent history of paleontology and an elegant history of life will be sadly mistaken. Despite its numerous flaws, I do recommend Fortey's book, as the most succinct overview of the history of life on Earth yet published. (Reposted from my 2001 Amazon review)"
15,037570261X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1879990-adam,3,"After Fortey's Earth: An Intimate History nearly turned me into a geologist, I had pretty high expectations of 'Life.' In some respects, these were met. Fortey's prose is very nice, his metaphors creative, and his references erudite. Yet this book was fundamentally lacking most of the things I was looking for it - expectations I had no right to expect it to fulfill, really. I was disappointed first of all that Fortey really doesn't cite sources. If he had, anything I felt he'd short-shrifted would have been easy to continue digging into on my own. I was also disappointed that Life lacked the in-depth character histories of scientists and their discoveries that made Earth so great. This was not absent, but merely underdeveloped.I had been hoping in general for more detail, more information, and a greater sense of thoroughness and connection. The book felt superficial - I knew most of the material going in, and had been hoping for more of a focus on the broad changes in Earth's geochemistry and, for instance, how climatic cycles and supercontinent cycles interacted with evolution. This was tantalizingly alluded to frequently, but never approached more explicitly or in any detail.It is interesting to see Fortey treat evolution as a given but prove it in some ways much more convincingly than Dawkins' Blind Watchmaker. The fossil record is indomitable evidence – how else could you explain it? It's disappointing that Fortey doesn't discuss evolution in any more interesting ways though. I mean, it's the subject of his book, after all. He doesn't ever really seem interested in the connections between periods and the forces driving change, though. He just sort of tells what happens and then apologizes for writing as though there were any kind of intentional progress involved. If you're new to the history of life (i.e., young) then this book would be great for you. If you're already into it, you probably shouldn't waste your time."
16,037570261X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9715435-james,5,"An incredibly journey starting with a cosmological timeline and the formation of the planets, moving into a geological timeline covering the earliest days of planet Earth and several hundred million years of 'planetary evolution'. Starting when Earth begins to take shape from base materials in the solar system orbiting the sun, moving forward to the first single cell lifeforms appearing in the fossil records, how the early atmosphere was formed by cellular life, and how each successive generation of life had an impact on the planet and atmosphere - which led to yet another batch of evolutionary changes and developments.Single celled life thrived and eventually came together building colonies, groups, and adapting until simple celled life grew into more complex forms. Eventually clusters of single celled life gave way to multi-cellular life which had effects on the planet and atmosphere, which in turn led to more adaptation and more evolutionary steps. Multi-cellular life gave way to more complex forms and bigger forms of life, each step taking thousands upon thousands, millions upon millions of years. Each small step either failing to continue or leading to something new, eventually the small steps added up to medium steps, those led to larger and larger steps as life grew more complex.The Folio Society edition did have a bit of a textbook feel to me, but not in a bad way. It was a very well put together book with detailed graphics and images demonstrating many of the steps taken over time."
17,037570261X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46029368-sohail,3,"Many years ago, when I was back in the university, there were certain professors who were the undisputed masters of storytelling. They'd tell you about the meal they had the night before. They'd talk - non-stop- about their awesomeness, and they'd always find an excuse to tell you about their personal lives. The interesting thing is that they were 'supposed' to lecture on certain subjects, and if you were patient enough, you'd find out that this they did, occasionally, when they were not talking about their last meal. Many students loved them: those professors were so awesome after all! These student loved them because instead of hearing a boring scientific lecture, the professors would lecture about their marital problems, personal drama, and interesting adventures in Thailand. How romantic! Students loved those professors! Because while listening to stories, they got the illusion that they were doing something scientific.I hated those professors. They wasted my time with their stories. They forgot that I did not attend those classes for stories. I had no interest in their adventures in Thailand. I didn't care about Thai girls.Reading this book was a very nostalgic experience. It reminded me of those 'awesome' professors and their adventures in Thailand.Some chapters are better than others, especially towards the end of the book. So, now that I have finished the book, I have to increase my rating from 2 to 3. Nevertheless, this book is far from scientific, and there is to little to learn."

This was still fairly comprehensive for the size and was enjoyable in a sense, but I think the writing was not as good and the layout was a bit less well conceived.

22,037570261X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3094832-steve,4,"Low 4. Fortey has provided an accessible and highly informative account of evolution. The book follows a line of development which mirrors ‘stratigraphy’ – the study of sedimentary rocks and the fossil faunas they contain, thus dating the emergence of all life-forms - in following a linear trajectory through history of life on Earth. What such analysis reveals is that there have been clear moments in the history of the Earth in which a cataclysmic event, such as the impact of a great meteorite, or an ice age, has punctuated the fossil record, like chapter headings in a story. The author notes that despite development of more accurate radiocarbon dating, this area of science has held on to labels such as Jurassic, which band together tens of millions of years. Fortey maintains that the history of evolution is equally a story in which ‘teleology’, or evolutionary development in line with purposeful pursuit of perfection, plays a part, just as chance, like an evolutionary throw of the dice, does. The earth was born from dust from a nascent star which accumulated in a mass as it spun trapped in the thrall of the Sun. It was formerly believed that such accretion was a gradual process, but currently it is argued that such a creative event was conceived violently, with meteorites continually annealing to the chaotic mass. On especially violent impact spun off the Moon between just over 4,500-3,500 million years ago. The feverish cauterisation shuffled and recombined elements while heating up the interior of the planet. What gave life its first potential foothold on the planet was the remarkable correlation between the planet’s size and temperature – a smaller planet would have burnt out, while a larger one may not have attained surface temperatures to sustain life. Another important contributing factor to the emergence of life on the planet, was the fact that it spun on its axis, thereby allowing all faces to be presented to the Sun, while the distance to the latter is not too short to absorb dangerous radiation levels. The chemical elements found in the Earth’s layers are the legacy of those early meteoric impacts, the central one being carbon, a ubiquitous and indispensable ingredient of life. Carbon atoms link in chains and bind with other atoms to fashion a whole array of organic chemicals. As the Earth’s solid crust developed, vents and volcanoes allowed gases to escape which created the planet’s atmosphere, retained by gravity while heated and processed by the Sun’s rays. What Fortey reveals is that Darwin had been extremely prescient in his suggestion that life had emerged from a ‘primeval soup’ with the correct balance of ingredients and transformed by heat. What is clear is that all life shares common characteristics at a molecular level. All scientists agree that the planet’s original atmosphere would have been poisonous to oxygen-dependent life-forms, with less than 0.1% present of oxygen’s current levels. However carbon-based elements were able to harness such poisonous ingredients for creative ends, in conjunction with other elements identified by Darwin – phosphorous and clay. Ironically, the Bible’s retelling of the creation of Adam from clay may have some element of truth as its atoms are arranged in sheets between which other chemicals can concentrate and thereby react. The first life-forms were bacteria such as ‘methanogens’ which thrive and reproduce in intense heat, and are found near volcanic vents and at great depth in the layers of the Earth – such organisms are termed ‘Archae’ in scientific papers. These organisms are ‘anarobes’ in that their biochemistry only operate in the absence of oxygen and recent research speculates that the real cradle of life occurred around ‘pyritferous seeps’, places where emanations from the planet’s interior seeped into the oceans. The quantity of oxygen in the Earth’s atmosphere built up over millennia; released as a by-product of primitive organisms’, ‘cyanobacteria’ or ‘blue-greens’ which still abound under dripping taps, ponds, and arctic climes, breaking down of carbon dioxide for their own nourishment. This accumulation of oxygen eventually paved the way for development of more advanced organisms. Although the first obvious biological structure was formed of skins or mats of interweaved ‘cyanobacteria’, it was within such structures that more complex cells were born with a nucleus holding a genetic blueprint. The latter captured ‘cyanobacteria’ within their cell structure, transforming them into ‘chloroplasts’, found in every plant cell today, thereby enabling them to photosynthesise. As evolution progressed, these advanced cells incorporated other structures such as ‘mitochondria’, aiding aerobic respiration; and ‘lysosomes’ enabling food processing. The first animals appeared in the Pre-Cambrian era, among which were the ‘Edicara Fauna’ or jellyfish. Foley states that what is indisputable is that one of the greatest transformations in the history of this planet took place at the end of this era, and consisted of an episode of mass extinction. After millennia of gradual painstaking development, evolution underwent a rapid revolution in the subsequent Cambrian period with, in a shortened passage of time, the emergence of a great variety of life-forms, some accompanied by shells. Among the latter were the ‘brachiopods’, distant relatives of snails and clams, ‘trilobites’, and ‘arthropods’, insects and crustaceans with jointed bodies. Fortey points out that ‘trilobites’ were not primitive organisms, possessing nervous systems, eyes, and brains of a sort, while their shell of calcium carbonate ensured their prevalence in the fossil record. The Cambrian era witnessed the first recognisable marine ecology and the first emergence of predatory behaviour with clear hunters and hunted. The author considers how the evolutionary tree has been reinterpreted. Whereas in the past it was regarded as one which ever branched outwards, it is now equated to resembling a Christmas tree, where it is wider at the base and thins upwards. Despite the plethora of Cambrian organisms which fell foul of the ‘survival of the fittest’ Foley indicates that there are few which would be unrecognisable to us. Moreover, he compares the rapid changes as a virtual primeval ‘arms race’ in which appearance of the first predators led to species developing ever more advanced protective skeletons, which prompted further developments in an endless cycle. The manner in which life evolved was heavily dependent on the manner in which the continents drifted as a result of plate tectonics. Originally, this process was understood to have resulted from the division of a supercontinent, Pangaea, some 220 million years ago, during the Triassic era. However, modern interpretation regards Pangaea itself as resulting from earlier continental drifts reaching back to the Pre-Cambrian period. The third of the planet not containing life-forms in the Cambrian period equates to the land mass, and the colonisation of the land by plants was only possible once several obstacles were surmounted. This would reveal that there had to exist many precursors to those species which eventually succeeded. One obstacle consisted of avoiding desiccation by developing waxy coats to cut out or reduce water loss, and a subsequent necessary development was the emergence of ‘stomata’, which admit air but which close when the plant needs to retain water. The next major development occurred with the emergence of land animals. By the Devonian era, between 410-360 million years ago, jawed fish with backbones appeared, which were the ancestors of all land animals Just as plant species developed ‘stomata, so land species developed lungs, with the appropriately named ‘lungfish’ developing the organ to enable them to survive periods of drought when rivers dried up. The Devonian period is so named as most of the rocks which underlie Exmoor date from this period, and it is ironic that one of this country’s most peaceful counties has lent its name to one of the most revolutionary periods of this planet’s history. It was only in the 1970s that ‘cladistics’ gained acceptance in the scientific community. This centres on the study of points at which the evolutionary tree branches out, estimating the relationships between distinct species, where each new branch coincides with the development of a new characteristic. The founding father of such studies, Willi Hennig, after initial hostility from the establishment, is now regarded akin to a secular saint. The greening of the Earth which occurred in the Devonian era became a luxurious forest of trees in the Carboniferous period, though flowers were yet to bloom in colour. During the latter period, the mergence of trees equipped with lignin and a trunk to bear the weight, and capillary action to transport water was extremely rapid. The exact dating for the evolution of the reptilian egg and the emergence of flight cannot be known for certain but it does appear that the Carboniferous period was one whose atmospheric conditions lent itself to gigantism in terms of both plants and insects. This period was unusual in that oxygen production from photosynthesis outstripped its removal, allowing for the appearance of monster arthropods. It was in this heady atmosphere that the first amniote egg, protected by a membrane, appeared, giving birth to the first reptile. What fuelled the emergence of both dinosaurs and mammals was the formation of Pangaea, with the subsequent story of terrestrial life denoted by superiority of one or the other. Yet, it would be the mass extinction at the end of the Permian era, some 250 million years ago, which would herald the appearance of most of the animal species we share the planet with today. It has been estimated that 96% of the marine species died out, including the trilobites, while the extinction of land vertebrates was less marked. The cause of this extinction remains a mystery but was probably due to a combination of climactic and geographical factors, as movement of the tectonic plates led to sweeping changes in local environments. The Cretaceous period witnessed the blossoming of flowers which developed chemical irritants as protection, which, in turn, led to evolutionary changes in insects to not only counteract such defences, but also to incorporate the same chemicals into their own means of self-defence. In tandem with such developments was that of inducements to pollination. The mystery surrounding the disappearance of the dinosaurs, was first explained as being the result of a mass extinction event by Luis Alvarez in 1980, and then by the subsequent discovery of an impact crater off the Yucatan peninsula in Mexico. What is obvious is that their disappearance led to the predominance of warm-blooded mammals. In the early 1990s molecular biologists estimated the divergence between Man and his closest relative as occurring some 5 million years ago. It would be the ecological change from forest to savannah, between 4-5 million years ago, which would trigger the most important steps in human evolution. Fortey concludes with a short summary of twentieth century findings in terms of fossil records of the early ancestors of Man."
23,037570261X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14612139-nick,2,"To me this was an experiment. I am not used to reading books on paleontology but as a child I had a sidenote interest in animals both living and extinct that I have nourished from time to time with the odd documentary and article. This however is the first book I have read on the subject and it left me with mixed feelings. On the one hand it is well written and with a clear objective to get as many people as possible exited about trilobites (and all the other stuff in the book). I can't shake the feeling that Fortey is somewhat nostalgic for what he perceives as the glorious time when upper class and middle class UK society were enthusiastic about ferns, fossils and learning to draw plants and animals based on a glance or a few bits and pieces preserved in rock. The above along with his personal anecdotes on how he experienced his life in the field, science conventions and major debates in his field made the book a lot less worthwhile for me. I get why it is there, to make it more lively but I can't shake the feeling I would have rather read more about the many forms of life that were common and rare in place of how he accidentally scared a waitress in Thailand. I did like his remarks and ""think about this little idea"" moments as I did appreciate the glimpse we get off how theories in paleontology come to be wide accepted (a lot less cordial then I expected) by all means he is rather brutally honest about the lesser aspects of his colleagues and general social norms that governs his field. With pride and greed intermixing with disdain and provincialism to result in often toxic conventions of colorful characters (they do seem a lot more interesting even if less efficient). The book also did have its moments of wonder when I was swept away to other places and times, saw incredible beings and wondered if the dice had fallen just a little different. But these positive parts of the book mixed with the aspects I did not appreciate were even more so downplayed by a final flaw, chaos. His chapters read like his mind, it jumps back and forth and we follow along his train of thought that as trains of thought go is rather incoherent. For me a good book is one I can pick up and check a few chapters and parts of those chapters. Say I would like to refresh my knowledge of early birds well I have to read the whole chapter of triasic to cretateous for it is spread allover. So in conclusion, I liked the book for it's moments of wonder it evoked as well as the glimpse into the social norms of paleontologists but it was not quite what I was looking for."
24,037570261X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27095228-martin-oetiker,5,"This is an excellent, personal and very lyrical account of the history of life on planet Earth. Richard Fortey is a great story teller, an expert in geology and evolution, who is able to make a vast & intricate subject understandable and interesting to a general reader. He gracefully interweaves events from his own life with the main theme of the book, noting how chance events, competition and the environment played a similar role in his personal journey as it did in the evolution of life, starting slowly and gradually building in speed & complexity like Ravel’s Bollero. The book opens with an amusing description of his first geological expedition to the Arctic island of Spitzbergen as a raw Cambridge university undergraduate. He introduces us to the vastness of geological time as he contemplates the origin of life in the vast, endless ocean. He debates various theories on the origin of life approx 4 billion years ago, and then traces the major developments which have led from single celled bacteria & archea, the symbiotic origin of eukaryotes and the development of multicellular organisms, to the Cambrian Explosion 540 million years ago, which established all the major phyla of modern day plants, fungi & animals. He describes the major innovations of life like the formation of membranes, the nucleus, mitochondria, photosynthesis & sexual reproduction which enabled the evolution of complex life. He then describes the evolution of all the major phyla from sponges & jellyfish, coral, molluscs, crustaceans, cephalopods, fish, insects, amphibians, reptiles, dinosaurs, birds & mammals as life moved onto the land and into the air. He often refers to the interaction between the geology & life, such as the oxidation of the atmosphere, the formation of volcanic islands, the movement of the continents via plate tectonics, and the formation of coal and hydrocarbons from organic matter and the various mass extinctions. Finally he talks about human evolution as we emerged from our mammal / primate / ape ancestors. This section seems a bit dated as there have been major discoveries and new ideas in the 23 years since this book was published, especially in the field of genetics.However, despite this, it is an excellent and well written book and provides a great overview of this fascinating subject. "
25,037570261X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56977114-jerald-pinson,4,"Richard Fortey's narrative of life is rich in detail and exuberant prose. As with most books on the subject, Fortey begins the first cells and photosynthetic bacterial mats that populated the world's oceans without much company for hundreds of millions of years. Beginning some 750 million years ago, the temp of diversification increased, as evidenced by the Ediacaran fauna, the Burgess Shale, and the transition of plants and animals onto land, all within a relatively short space of time. But Fortey's narrative isn't written in the form of a textbook. Being written for a broad audience, it's an enjoyable and easy read, with plenty of diversions to keep the reader's interest piqued. At least 1/3 of the book deals with the human stories associated with the history of life: of fossil discovery, the development of theory, and the various ways researchers pieced together the history of Earth, often using nothing but scant clues, running into multiple dead ends, and having to contend with the vitriol and bile of adversarial colleagues. While these stories add flavor to Fortey's history of life — and open a window into the history of science — they do detract somewhat from the overall narrative. Instead of covering deep time history in each chapter sequentially, Fortey presents history piecemeal, often in a disjointed fashion that's constantly interrupted or guided by the human aspects of the tale. Consequently, there's a lot of detail that's lacking in the book. Otherwise, Fortey provides a vivid and — at times — poignant account of the history of life on Earth. And unlike some, Fortey doesn't place much of a special emphasis on the evolution of humans, to which he devotes a chapter near the end. Rather, the origin of Homo sapiens is presented in just the same way as every other group he records, albeit with a bit more detail. While this books is a bit dated by now, I recommend it for anyone approaching the history of life for the first time, or for anyone looking for a quick refresher. "
26,037570261X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7552897-sebastian,3,"I really wanted to like this book more than I did. Turns out, I know most of what it tells us – besides the obvious point that it is a familiar story to anyone with a decent general education in biology (at least the outline is). I have read this story, better written, in a number of other works. Fortey even quips about “the common perception of geological history” at the start of Chapter 9, but then more or less goes along with it for the remaining chapters, touching on most of the familiar bases; hello to the main groups of dinosaurs and those pesky aquatic fellows and those other flittering ones who aren’t really dinosaurs but what can you do, hello to the Smilodon and the horse and all the jolly wooly elephantine family, hello to the giant sloths and miscellaneous marsupials of Australia, and finally, hello to Australopithecus afarensis, Paranthropus boisei, and of course, cap it off with our nearest family of Homos. The thing is, I have picture books from way back when I was a wee tot that go through this same sequence.The writing, although very beautiful, also seems a bit disjointed. There are bits about more or less famous scientists and bits about their discoveries, but rarely is there a clear narrative link between the two that would, possibly, interweave the story of the discovery with what we now know about these facts into a whole that would be greater than its parts.Now that the grumbling is out of the way, I have to add that it is not a bad book per se – the first part about the very beginnings of life is fascinating stuff and it shows that Fortey’s specialty are earlier life forms, such as his trilobites – but it faces truly stiff competition in the sub-sub-genre of “overview of all life” and despite the fact that the author may be more legit science-wise than some of his competitors, he does lag a bit writing-wise."
27,037570261X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12235756-steve,5,"This is my second book by Fortey and I enjoyed it and learned a lot despite it being 20 years old. In those 2 decades many new fossils have been discovered and molecular biology has made huge strides in our understanding of the genetic relationships between living organisms.Fortey does a wonderful job summarizing the earliest fossils of simple life forms and where the rocks that bare them are found. Throughout the book he relates the fossils with the types of habitats they inhabited and the positions and states of the continents.He tells the stories of the discovery of many important fossils and the people who discovered them and the disputes about their interpretations. His stories include his own personal explorations and discoveries around the globe. Much of his story is a search for tropical or equatorial fossil environments looking for Trilobites that favored those habitats. I found it very interesting that those fossils could be used to indicate the past positions of those locations relative to the movement of the continental plates.Fortey gives detailed descriptions of how specific groups of fossils can be used as ""index fossils"" to show relative ages of sedimentary formations around the globe. The later chapters detail human fossils and what they tell us about human evolution. Much of his view of human evolution is outdated because so many discoveries in terms of fossils and molecular data have occurred in the past 20 years.All in all, I can recommend this book to anyone interested in paleontology and paleo-biogeography."
28,037570261X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63319555-rachel-welton,5,"Richard Fortey is one of my heroes. He writes in such an accessible way, I can hear his voice in my head. I read half this book 20 years ago, a process that was interrupted by the arrival of 4 kids in 3 years. When I rediscovered it on my bookshelf, it still had the bookmark in it waiting for me. I had to start from the beginning again. This is a wonderful romp through the ages of the planet, in glorious sensory detail. The details are maybe easier for me to absorb now than 20 years ago. Some of the science has changed in the intervening years, as you would expect (e.g. birds are dinosaurs and many non-avian dinosaurs had feathers), and there is one obvious typo (the universe is not 5Ga - that's the solar system you are thinking of), but overall, this is a marvellous book.Well worth the read for scientists and the layman alike. "
29,037570261X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75632563-mark-walker,4,"Really illuminating whizz through ""Life: The Early Years"". Fortey is such an entertaining writer able to mix in some personal observations and anecdotes without intruding on the flow of the narrative. He's definitely stronger on the earlier rather than the later -- you get the sense that by the time the dinosaurs come along he's lost a little of his enthusiasm (he is the Trilobite expert after all) -- and it's certainly a little outdated already, as research in this field seems to move very rapidly with each new discovery, but a great book for putting more specific texts in a broader context."
30,037570261X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24272308-rob,4,"This book would make a wonderful draft, but I can’t avoid the conclusion the author has been let down by his editor. The book gives a fairly clear and informative description of the evolution of life for the non-scientist reader. However it gives up too soon when it comes to balancing scientific accuracy with readability. I didn’t expect to find more scientific accuracy in Bryson’s Short History of Nearly Everything than in this book. I didn’t expect to find pretty obvious logical lapses in this book by a scholar who boasts in it about earning a First from Cambridge. The other shortcoming is that the author’s excessive focus on himself hasn’t been edited out."
31,037570261X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19446286-elentarri,4,"Professor Fortey takes the reader on a chronological tour of the the biological history of earth. However, his story is not a boring slog through the strata, but an eclectic stroll among fascinating organisms. Fortey includes many asides in his narrative, including important aspects of geology, portraits of eccentric paleontologists and personal anecdotes about fossil hunting is unusual locations. This book manages to summarise paleontological controversies in a fair manner without bogging down the story. I found the author's descriptive writing style to be rich and lyrical. "
32,037570261X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68022124-steve-lee,4,"It feels a little churlish to knock off 1 star for the age of this book. As a biography of life on Earth it is a great read, with the author's understandable bias towards the Palaeozoic. Published in 1998, it does suffer from its age in 2020 - there have been significant new discoveries with regard to avian dinosaurs, feathered dinosaurs and mass extinctions - which could leave a current reader less than fully informed on certain topics. However, I particularly enjoyed the author's narrative style and will definitely consider reading more of his work."

42,037570261X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17609571-peter-ellwood,5,"What a lovely book. My goodness, the history of life on our planet is well served, what with Richard Dawkins Ancestor’s Tale, and this one. Both are beautifully – beautifully! - well written, and each complements the other perfectly. Dawkins is a little light on the most ancient inhabitants of the planet, the first stirrings of life – and Richard Fortey absolutely excels in describing them; tending if anything to run slightly out of steam in describing more developments such as the emergence of homo sapiens. But read the two and you’ve covered it – and enjoyed great style in the process.His tone is frequently one of humble, quiet amusement, both at himself and his profession; and it is a killer formula. He manages to make the dry-as-old-bones subject of early life simply sparkle with interest, the way he describes it. For example: “I have spent much of the last twenty years trying to imagine what it would be like to wallow in Ordovician oceans…” Haven’t we all, Richard, haven’t we all. Or again, on the tendency for this area of study to be divvied up along gender lines by the upper crust in Victorian times, he remarks, wide-eyed, “while the ladies botanized, the gents geologized”. My earlier image is in fact wrong. The subject he treats pre-dates even bones, by a long way. But it is alive with wonder. I had never stopped to think that bones, and shells, quite possibly owe their existence to the development of predation for example: while life forms just fed quietly on algae or plants there was no real reason for protection, they could get by perfectly satisfactorily as slime. But the moment they started trying to eat each other, then evolution kicked in and suddenly they were all sporting shells and or skeletons. And people like Richard Fortey figured all this out just by staring at fossils…There are many such insights in this book. No matter how much you know about the origins of life, it contains more which will fascinate and absorb you. For example, imagine a palaeontologist being able to write so well that you chuckle out loud at his description of the difficulties he encountered in tracing the ancient Cambrian equator in Thailand. Richard Fortey manages it: “matters got worse when the girls arrived”.  I won’t spoil it with too many details here – read the book. And finally, it takes a special kind of palaeontologist to observe, in writing of the fact that the fossilised droppings of ancestral tree sloths can still be burned: “Would it not be wonderful to drink a cup of tea brewed on giant sloth’s dung?”. I must not give the wrong impression. A shallow reviewer such as myself tends to collect these witty asides together and put them in one place: I would not wish to leave the impression all the same that the book is a writhing mass of schoolboy humour. It most emphatically is not. It is written with clarity and intelligence, with occasional self-deprecating asides of this kind which bring it to life – and all of which comes together to produce an informative and beautiful piece of work."
43,037570261X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3104177-james,3,"Yet another of the myriad of ""history of life"" pop-science books, I think what makes this particular one stand out are the auto-biographical elements interspersed with the scientific topics. Without these elements, the book would have been fairly generic, despite Fortey's readable and engaging writing style. Many other books cover the same ground scientifically, most significantly of the books I have read being Don Prothero's Evolution: What The Fossil's Say And Why It Matters, and Nick Lane's Life Ascending: The Ten Great Inventions of Evolution. Both of these books cover the science in more detail, as well as with more depth, than Fortey's book. They are also much more up to date. Bill Bryson's book A Short History of Nearly Everything incorporates the history of science and biographical elements in a much greater depth than Fortey, and with an element of humor that Fortey usually lacks.There was one other issue that bothered me continually as I was reading. Fortey constantly refers to such things as the ""chain of life"", the ""ladder of evolution"", higher and lower animals, and so on. While this may be a popular science book, that does not mean that the author should incorporate what amounts to lay-audience mistaken conceptions of how evolution works. Perhaps Fortey felt that a popular science book was not the place to address such philosophical issues, but plenty of other authors do so without much issue. There is no ""chain of being"", and there are no such thing as higher and lower animals. These are holdovers from the 19th century. Fortey should know better. I really wanted this book to be better, and while it certainly isn't bad, it falls short of the other books I mentioned. It wouldn't be the first thing I would recommend to someone who was interested in learning about the history of life, paleontology, or evolution. There are better options. That said, if you are already well acquainted with the science, it's worth reading for the insights into how science is conducted by scientists, as well as the vivid descriptions of past ecosystems and organisms. "
44,037570261X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3110209-daveski,4,"Four billion years may seem like a lot of ground to cover for a single book, but Fortey handles it pretty well. He is helped by the fact that we simply don't know a whole lot about much of this time, and this book is as much about we don't know as what we do. Using the fossil record as a guide, he takes us through the evolution of life, starting from the primordial soup and ending with the start of recorded human history.Fortey, a paleontologist at the Natural History Museum in London, is a great writer who really lets his passion for science shine through. He populates his narrative with anecdotes about long-extinct species, as well as incidents from his own career. Most of the book is pretty engaging, although I'll admit that there were times that he lost me a bit (no matter how much passion is behind it, I just don't find a discussion of rock layers interesting).If there is a flaw here, it's that this book is a pretty dense read for something that is ostensibly aimed at non-scientists. I've got several years of college-level biology under my belt and I still felt a bit overwhelmed at times, and I would imagine that someone with no real science background would be left scratching their head fairly frequently. While I appreciate the fact that he doesn't attempt to dumb anything down, at the same time I think he could have left out some of the details for simplicity's sake without losing any meaning.Overall I did enjoy this book quite a lot, even though it took me much longer to get through it than it probably should have. Despite the occasional dull bit, this is a passionate and interesting history of how life evolved. Recommended to anyone interested in evolution or biology - just don't expect a breezy summer read."
45,037570261X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45343459-leigha-crothall,3,"Fortey packs this book with plenty of unnecessary and irrelevant references to art and literature which, instead of enhancing the reading, serve only to create a rather patronising/pretentious tone. The book contains plenty of snapshot scenes of Fortey's life experiences which, frankly, could have been omitted to create space for the scientific details the author insists he has no time/room for; Fortey addresses the reader directly and states his intention to glide over details - if those details had been included and Fortey's babbling been cut, I imagine this book could have been far more informative. That being said, the information in this book is undoubtedly accurate (at the time of publication) and Fortey constantly reminds you of the time when the book was written and ongoing scientific debates at that time, serving to contextualise the book very seamlessly. However, the only chapter that is particularly engaging is 'Humanity', describing the evolution of mankind in simplified yet expansive detail - if only the other species in this book had been treated the same. Perhaps if Fortey cared less about making this book relevant in literary circles - e.g. his constant attempts to imbue symbolism to a mere chance in evolution! - this book would have been more enjoyable.Long story short: there are almost certainly more concise - and scientific - books on the market to learn about the history of life, the only element to this book that makes it worthwhile buying would be the status of the author in the scientific community; Fortey's tone and delivery is far too patronising and babbling to keep a reader engaged for long periods of time."
46,037570261X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10968314-sarah,4,"This book gets better as history unfolds. At first the storyline meanders in the murky Precambrian seas, and all the author's devotion to trilobites and conodonts can't quite animate the story. But the tale gets legs when the tetrapods poke their heads out of the seas. (Fortey wryly acknowledges that this is so; we can identify more with land animals than with mats of sea algae, no matter how crucial the role those played in world development.)The chapter on dinosaurs - full of passages to savor, Fortey gets going and starts riffing on Disney's Fantasia, Jurassic Park and academia...here's a bit, but it's like excerpting a few bars from a jazz solo, you need to experience the whole thing...On the emergence of the Cretaceous meteorite extinction theory: Paleontologists are accustomed to being poor relations in the scientific family compared with physicists and mathematicians, like obscure cousins only asked to the big house for Christmas and Easter. But suddenly, they could be at the head of the table!...The words ‘bolide impact’ became a commonplace in conversations around the fringes of lecture halls, uttered with an easy familiarity between slurps of cappuccino during intervals between the presentation of papers. The possibilities of jobs and grants seemed to bob to the top of this ferment like dumplings in a rich stew."
47,037570261X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2441212-scott,3,"Only into Chapter 2 but I can tell, as interesting as the topic is, its going to end up being one of those texts that I would have spent a wee bit more time editing down. I would wager that a good 50 pages could be excised without hurting the style or content a bit.The author attempts to make the subject matter accessible to the layman by interject personal history, anecdotes and humor while covering 3,500 million years of life in 350 or so pages. The mesh is usually awkward, and the humor either falls flat or is oddly inappropriate for a science text. At one point, he compares the fossil beds in Newfoundland to the outcome of a ""trait"" of the Cornish for ""wreaking"" - a bit of nautical naughtiness where ships are lured onto the rocks so that cargo can be plundered. I doubt the Cornish would be pleased.While the book doesn't fail completely, it falls short of success because of this uneven tone. Interesting note I am concurrently reading ""Quantum Man"", a biography of Richard Feynman which intertwines science into a biography told through personalized history, anecdotes and humor. It succeeds in this joining where ""Life"" fails."
48,037570261X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2892211-jason-mills,3,"Fortey surveys the progress of life over 4 billion years, detailing the developments and kinds of organisms, as well as their effects on and reactions to an ever-changing environment. A paleonotologist himself, he illustrates the account with fossils and geology, with pleasant asides, anecdotes about other scientists and light allusions to poetry and literature. There are 4 sections of black-and-white photo plates, a glossary, reading list and index. (A diagram of the geological timeline would have helped, a strange and glaring omission.)If that sounds like faint praise, I'm afraid it is. This feels like a long book (~350 pages): the small print and absurdly long paragraphs do the reader no favours, and I found Fortey's prose dry. More importantly, the book has no particular thesis to present: what sounds like an exciting celebration of life's diversity turns out to be a tiring parade of details.There's nothing actually wrong with this book, nothing to take issue with. It's just a bit dull. Dawkins' The Ancestor's Tale is a much more interesting read covering similar terrain."
49,037570261X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47701179-j-dolan,4,"Please tell me I'm not alone, but have you ever wanted to know, just for the hell of knowing them, the names of the geological ages of our planet in order? What plants and animals lived where, when, for how long, and what happened to them? The difference between the Carboniferous and the Cretaceous, the Pliocene and the Pleistocene? Were 7-foot-long scorpions and dragonflies really once the norm?If you're like me, then this is the book for you. Professor and field-researcher Fortey covers it all, from the first single-cell wrigglers (and where they likely came from) to the slime mats that once blanketed the world, the improbable first trees, the even more improbable dinosaurs, and most improbable of all, us. His prose is a bit dry in parts, especially at the beginning-- I learned more about alga and those damn slime mats than I ever wanted to-- but on the whole, pure scientific ice cream; not that many pages into it, and I was lapping it up with a spoon.Retain 10% of what you read in this book and people will think you some sort of professor yourself. Plus, turn on the TV and see how much better you've gotten at Jeopardy. "
50,037570261X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5624130-emma,3,"I started off really loving this book but by the end of it I wasn't so sure I was that taken with it.I am a big fan of Fortey's writing style and the personal experiences he recounts but by the end of the book I felt as though these experiences were taking up space that could have been given to the story of Life. There is a few billion years to work with after all. I would have liked to have seen more in depth discussion throughout the book and more on subjects such as terrestrial invertebrates, flowering plants and speciation to name a few.Though the discussion of the K-T extinction was very meteorite centered with other possible contributing factors not mentioned to any great extent I felt this could be excused due to the age of the book.I would very much like to read an updated and expanded edition of this book sans accounts of personal experiences. Admittedly I would love to read Fortey's biography so hopefully there'll be one soon enough. "
51,037570261X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5693068-elisabeth,4,"I like better the title of my own copy of this book, “Life: An Unauthorized Biography”, as this is indeed the biography of life, since its birth, shrouded in mystery, going through its long infancy of bacteria and stromatolites, its youth of excess after the Cambrian Explosion, its blooming and its crises, with species rising and vanishing or becoming other species, until the present and us; the growth of the Tree of Life that, as Darwin said, is indeed beautiful, the most beautiful thing that exists in Nature. Fortey’s narrative can be quite engrossing, filled with wonder and easily followed by the interested amateur. He does tend to digress a lot, but in fact his digressions are rather fun, mostly about the people and the struggles involved in conjuring from a dry and dead fossil record the ghost of living things gone."
52,037570261X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1726916-jonathan-bein,4,"Great read. Fortey supplies just the right mix of science, scientific anecdote, and biography to keep the casual readers interest. The book is a history of life through the fossil record. It starts with the big bang and ends with the advent of modern man. It's value, other than the enjoyment one gets in the reading, is in the perspective that the knowledge brings. Much as studying astronomy leads to an appreciation of the vastness of space and how miniscule a part of the universe we are, paleontology helps us to better appreciate the mechanism of life itself and the timeframe within which the drama of evolution has played out. If you have a curiosity about the natural world you will enjoy this book."
53,037570261X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/83139-jennifer,3,"My impatience with this book was rarely the book's fault, but more often just friction coming from the fact that this is an evolution story for the lay reader, and I've already heard all the basic outlines so many times before. I'd bought this so many years ago, when the information would have been fresher, and I might have liked it better then. But, that's what it is.There were some magical descriptive moments, and I appreciated some of the discussions on how scientific controversies were/are resolved. But a lot of familiar information plus some odd asides made large chunks of the book a slog. Not sure exactly who I would recommend this to. In general, I think most readers would be better off reading a more recently written book. "
54,037570261X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1645159-matt,4,"I always wanted to read a book that went through the entire chronological sequence of life on earth and I thought this book did a good job of doing that. I also enjoyed the autobiographical portions of the book (probably because I am a scientist and find the author's line of work very interesting). I do wish the author would have focused more on the ages of dinosaurs and mammals, but he is a trilobite guy, so he expectedly focused on the earlier periods of life. I also liked the fact that he did not have some agenda in recounting this history (such as promoting some radical theory or having something like Richard Dawkin's anti-religious subjectivity in his ""scientific"" writings). "
55,037570261X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27893653-nancy-cousintine,5,"What can I say? it's a wonderful trip through Earth history. We really do live on a planet with a most amazing past, and present. So sad to not have that Time machine to see with fresh eyes just how things have been. The story of Earth, and the ever changing parade of life on it is breath taking. What we do not know greatly outweighs what we do know...but the snapshots that we do have (so far) have made the dim past a little more clear. This really is a panoramic sort of book. There are illustration, but it is the writing, and the application of your own imagination that makes this a great trip. Thumbs Up, and ""Hear, Hear!"""
56,037570261X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75157-carol,2,"I ended up just skimming through the final half of this book after trying to read the first half. I tired of reading the author's travel logs (and even his travel photos) and a lot of the book I've read before. So, I just read some of the parts that I felt I hadn't read before and thought might be interesting before putting it away. It held my interest somewhat as I am very interested in our geological past, but I have read other books on this subject that were not only more interesting but easier to read and understand. Glad I tried to read it, however."
57,037570261X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17815469-rob-damon,4,"I read a version called Life:An Unauthorized Biography. What an interesting and well documented story of the history of life on Earth. I was fascinated by the idea of nothing existing other than bacteria for the first 3.5 billion years, and then suddenly complexity emerges from what must have been a planet enveloped in slime!This book has educational and entertainment value. A brilliantly written and compelling read of our ancestral history on Earth.I still have this in my collection and dip back into it on the odd occasion. "
58,037570261X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6447445-janet,4,"This is a great read for a non-science person (like me!). It's clearly expressed with minimal technical language. And if you've ever wondered what a clade is, there's a great explanation!My only complaint is that the personal anecdotes are not always very successful. The opening story, about an expedition to Spitsbergen, is very effective, but some of the others are a little dubious and don't really support the narrative. I recommend reading it along with Horseshoe Crabs and Velvet Worms, which gives more detail on a few species. "
59,037570261X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12491673-andrew-brady,4,"An absolutely fascinating and ambitious book, with snippets of Prof. Fortey's academic career and opinions. I detected something of a bitterness towards other areas of science - especially when he was writing about the history of the discovery of continental drift and - it may just be me - something of a reluctance to discuss the dinosaurs with sufficient imagination and vigor (Trilobite expert snobbery/jealousy, perhaps?)The final chapters regarding our direct ancestors were surprisingly rousing, and rank among the best Natural History writing I have had the pleasure to read."
