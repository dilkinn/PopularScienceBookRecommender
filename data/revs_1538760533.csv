I enjoyed the audiobook - Steves narration is easy to listen to while also being engaging. However, the encyclopedia-like layout make the printed version a practical compendium for later reference. It is excellent for understanding how the mind works/doesn't work, and how we all deceive ourselves into thinking that we actually understand probability. For people who are just getting into critical thinking and scientific skepticism and want to learn about ""how to know what's really real"", but don't want to do this whole podcast-nonsense: This book is a great place to start! It is well written, with just the right balance between entertaining examples and compelling explanations. For SGU-veterans: If you have worked through every episode of the SGU, monitored a wide selection of skeptical science blogs, and memorized all 24 logical fallacies in their order of disgrace to the human intellect; there probably isn't a lot a new information for you here, you cocky little twit. Why haven't you bought it for everyone around you yet?"

I have been a long time SGU listener (almost 10 years), and they have been a major inspiration for me to teach myself critical thinking (I still do) and initiate a grassroots skeptical movement in Turkey along with a website as well as a top podcast of our own. So naturally, when I heard the team was coming up with an actual book, I was very excited and pre-ordered it immediately.Steve and SGU team did a great job of compiling the basic building blocks of scientific skepticism and critical thinking. The book starts with the introduction to scientific skepticism and why it is important, continues to explore the major factors that contribute and distort our understanding of the world, major reasoning and cognitive faults we all make/have, the science/pseudoscience demarcation problem. Then it goes on to give some real-world examples to allow the reader to practice what they learned about critical thinking skills in the earlier chapters. It talks about historical events that claimed to be ""extraordinary"" and turned out to be not so, some existing pseudoscience out there and why those claims do not hold water and personal experiences of the contributors in the domain of scientific skepticism and critical thinking.In the last section, there is a very comprehensive reference list. The book has ALL the major references it mentions along the chapters in one place and in great detail, and even that is alone is such a great resource.The language of the book is very clear, easy to read & understand with lots of examples. It is very well organized the earlier chapters prepare the reader for the later ones that provide more examples.Overall this is a great book to introduce a person to critical thinking & scientific skepticism. it explains why this is an important topic, why people should be mindful of how they reach to conclusions, make decisions, even how they argue with each other and how to try to convince others. For me, this will be a great comprehensive resource to use when I need to explain someone a basic concept with great examples. I did not learn anything new by reading it since I knew pretty much every concept described in the book due to immersing myself into the literature of scientific skepticism and critical thinking in the past years, but despite that, I loved to book for its comprehensiveness, clarity and being an overall resource for every fundamental concept in scientific skepticism. Actually, let me re-phrase myself: ""I did not learn any new information from the book, but as usual I learned a lot on how to communicate and articulate these things from Steve and his narration style, as usual. He is such a great communicator, an aspiration for all of us.""I will keep this book as a fundamental resource in my library and definitely can see myself gifting to many people in the future. What a great tool to help us to spread the news!Thank you SGU team, it has been a pleasure to read this!"
2,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24035606-ryan-boissonneault,5,"This is one of the best books on critical thinking and skepticism since Carl Sagan’s The Demon-Haunted World. Although you would hope, in the 21st century, that it shouldn’t have to be explained why treating eczema with turmeric infusions is a bad idea, gullibility for pseudoscience is a recurring feature of human psychology and in need of constant debunking. The first part of the book covers the unreliability of our senses, cognitive biases, logical fallacies, and the difference between science and pseudoscience. This part covers the core skills of critical thinking and skepticism and reminds us that we must be constantly vigilant against the plethora of ways we can delude ourselves. In fact, the running theme throughout the book is the concept of fallibilism, and how we are all wired to engage in biased and logical fallacious thinking (even self-proclaimed skeptics or critical thinkers). As the authors constantly remind us, this is a tendency we all have to perpetually work to overcome, and that no one is immune to bias just because they identify as a skeptic.The rest of the book covers specific cases of pseudoscience, pseudo-journalism, and instances where pseudoscience can harm or kill. The book ends with some advice on the practical application of critical thinking skills and how to engage with others persuasively when debating pseudoscientific ideas. My only complaint: in discussing the line of demarcation between science and pseudoscience and falsifiability, the authors never mention Karl Popper once. Popper is, of course, the most prominent early advocate of falsifiability and one of the greatest philosophers of science of the twentieth century. The authors discuss falsifiability, critical rationalism, error correction, and several other ideas that were popularized by Popper without, to my mind, giving appropriate credit. Overall, if you’re new to skepticism, this book covers the full assortment of critical thinking, psychology, logic, and science needed to navigate complex issues and engage in independent thinking. If you’re not new to the subject, it will act as a nice refresher and a welcome escape from a world filled with superficial thinking, conspiracy theories, fraud, and outright stupidity. "
3,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16212136-peter-pete-mcloughlin,5,"This is one of the better skeptic books. The author doesn't merely debunk the usual suspects of pseudoscience although there is plenty of debunking of UFOs, Ghosts, Homeopathy, Acupuncture, Astrology et al. The author goes into our cognitive biases and blind spots and illogical thought processes and provides tools for fighting ever new pseudoscience, fake news, hoaxes, and assorted nonsense which springs eternal in many forms. This book is a gem that will give you a fighting chance against lying minds be they other people's or your own."

5,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3440334-fred-forbes,5,"Some friends and family have called me annoying since whenever they post something on social media that is a crock, I call them on it and provide the relevant proof. I don't know why, but seeing crap like that posted just raises my ire. (Note opinions, religious, love messages, cute furpersons get a pass.) Despite the fact that some claim I am picking on them, I do note that the offender's postings tend to drop dramatically when they have been chastened a few times. (What are you, the sheriff of Facebook?)Anyway, something I have pondered lies at the core of the issue, namely, why do people believe that stuff in the first place? So, this book was right up my alley and did not disappoint. The book is truly a guide as to why we think the way we do - and even as the sheriff, the true skeptic needs to realize they have some of those issues as well, we just need to try harder to stay as balanced and unbiased as possible.So if you want to improve your critical thinking or perhaps understand why some folks seem incapable of it pick up a copy. The fun thing about the book is that though it is an easy read as it is irreverent , casual, full of humor and anecdotes at bottom it is a serious work, directed at correcting some serious issues."

I like that most of chapters are quite short, because it was easy to read it on the go. At some paragraphs I had to really focus to uderstand the full meaning of it, but I put it on a blame of me not being perfect english speaker and, what is more important, who said that it must be an easy lecture ;)"
7,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45877282-jeffrey-debris,5,"Sometimes you find a book that's just so good a 5* rating just doesn't quite feel right. The Skeptics'Guide to the Universe is one of those books for me and easily my best non-fiction read of the last couple of years. This book not only helps you to become a true skeptic, it will also help you to deal with people who don't believe in fact-based reasoning, something that seems to be an increasing trend these years.Time to put on your critical thinking cap!""Are you ready to put become part of an epic quest, one that has taken us from huddling in dark caves to stepping foot on the moon? (Yes, we really did that.) Like all adventures, this one is foremost a journey of self-discovery. The monsters you will slay and the challenges you will face are mostly constructs of your own mind. But if you can master them, the rewards are indeed epic.""This is how the book introduction ends. I couldn't agree more. I have been challenged, and indeed, we are nothing more than bags of mostly water with an emotional flavour with our own biases and preferences. But knowing is half the battle!The book starts off with the what the core concepts are of skepticism. The first section of the book gives you all the tools you need to learn the tricks of the trade to becoming a true skeptic. The most important lesson you will learn from the first section is that you are no better than anyone else, even if it's easy to think you are. For instance; the Dunning-Kruger effect is one to always keep in mind. This effect describes the inability to evaluate one's own competency, leading to general tendency to overestimate one's abilities. It's not just about dumb people not realising how dumb they are, you should know that you are just as ignorant as the average person is in every area of knowledge that you are not an expert in. Another thing that's very important to realise is our tendency to seek out or interpret information as support for previously held notions or beliefs. This is called confirmation bias and we're all guilty of this. We all have certain world views and beliefs and everything that supports it, we hold on firmly, to rationalise that we're a good, moral person. What's important to know is that this will differ from person to person, but once you see confirmation bias in action, you'll see it everywhere. I know this section in particular opened my eyes to some discussions on the internet and where people were coming from!""Confirmation bias is the one bias to rule all biases, the mayor of Biastown, captain of the USS Bias, the Sith Lord of the bias side of the Force (okay, you get the idea).""One thing I really liked about this book is that it tells you to always respect other people, because you never have all the information. You don't know where they're coming from and that's why you should withhold judgement and give other people the benefit of the doubt. This tendency to rationalise our own actions as being the result of external factors beyond our control, while ascribing other people's actions to internal factors is called Fundamental Attribution Error, and it's very easy to spot, although you should always remain vigilant when you're guilty of this bias.The book is very thorough on its subjects and basically after you've finished the first section (which is also the largest, by far) you will have a Swiss Army Knife of skills and knowledge you can put to use to become the skeptic you want to be! From placebo effects, to conspiracy theories, to cold reading, to pseudosciences, to all the psychological aspects. You just keep wanting to read more and learn more!People often say that science in itself is a ""religion"" as well, but what they tend to forget is that although science might seem to be the denial of the existence of God, or other supernatural things, science is not a religion, it's a method. The real beauty of science to me can be found in this quote:""The scientific method consists of the use of procedures designed to show not that our predictions and hypothesis are right, but that they might be wrong. Scientific reasoning is useful to anyone in any job because it makes us face the possibility, even the dire reality, that we were mistaken"" —Carol TavrisThe Human race has a constant need to find answers and science is one of the best ways to find answers. And if a theory is found to be flawed, or that they simply don't hold up to extensive testing, then those theories and views will have to be altered. That's how I want to be as a person too. If people can show me my reasoning is wrong, even if it might go against everything I hold dear, I have to face the possibility that I may be wrong. That's the beauty of science. As the book itself states: If you learn new information, happily incorporate it into your assessment.I really loved the first section of the book and I find it hard to shut up about this book. The other sections were equally interesting, but were mostly stories about how people put their skepticism into practice. They were lovely stories, and definitely worth reading, because they're cautionary tales and give you solid advice on how to deal with certain situations, such as antivaxers and climate change deniers.This book is essential reading for anyone who wants to learn how to think more critically for themselves. Something we can all use in this time of fake news and science deniers. ;) This books deserves all the five stars I bestow upon it, although I would rather give it 6/5. It's just that awesome!I will finish this review with one last quote:""Science is a way to teach how something gets to be known, what is not known, to what extent things are known (for nothing is known absolutely), how to handle doubt and uncertainty, what the rules of evidence are, how think about things so that judgements can be made, how to distinguish truth from fraud, and from show."" —Richard FeynmanFinal score:Cover art: 🌟🌟🌟🌟 (reminiscent of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy ;) )Paper smell: 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟Print/lettering: 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟Originality: 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟Information: 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟Overall: 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟Happy reading!-Jeffrey"

9,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1345046-todd-martin,3,"I’m a big fan of The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe podcast, which is dedicated to the promotion of science and critical thinking. If you aren’t familiar with it, I would urge you check it out. As an outgrowth of the podcast the self-proclaimed ‘skeptical rogues’ produced a new book called The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe: How to Know What's Really Real in a World Increasingly Full of Fake. The book covers many of the fundamentals upon which the podcast is based in that it delves into the multiplicity of ways that people can be fooled into believing things that simply aren’t true. As Nobel Prize winning physicist Richard Feynman once said “The first principle is that you must not fool yourself — and you are the easiest person to fool.” The first section of the book describes various errors in reasoning including such things as: the fallibility of memory, cognitive biases, logical fallacies, heuristics, data mining, the placebo effect, p-hacking, the law of large numbers, the Dunning-Kruger Effect, motivated reasoning, the ideomotor effect, and many others. Probably the overarching theme of this section (which represents more than 50% of the text) is that it’s not just those with whom we disagree that engage in sloppy reasoning, bad arguments and superstitious thinking, it’s all of us to a greater or lesser degree. Even the most ardent of critical thinkers needs to guard against falling into one of these cognitive traps.The book then goes on to cover some specific anecdotal examples of skeptical lessons written by each of the rogues. This is followed by practical advice as to how to double check reporting performed by the news media and a few specific examples of pseudoscientific thinking. Finally … the book wraps up with some advice as to how to foster critical thinking in others. On their podcast, the rogues billed the book as a skeptical primer that does a deep dive on the fundamentals of critical thinking and skepticism. As such, the book entirely succeeds. It was, for the most part, written by Steve Novella who is not only brilliant, but is an articulate and effective science communicator. The text is clearly and concisely written and does a thorough job explaining the common (and several uncommon) mechanisms of deception. I also appreciated the books short/manageable chapters and logical organization. I do have a criticism however, though perhaps it’s not so much with the book itself as with my expectation of the book. The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe podcast has great energy, and discusses various aspects of science and critical thinking in a fun and humorous manner. unfortunately, this book doesn’t possess these attributes to any appreciable degree (i.e. it’s not particularly fun or humorous). As science communicators, the first order of business isn’t to present the audience with a litany of dry facts, it’s to generate a sense of excitement and curiosity that primes the audience to learn. Improving the entertainment value would have helped in this regard and may have been achieved had there been more collaboration with the other (less ‘pendantic’) members of the group (Bob, Cara, Jay and Evan). Good information … but rather dry and lacking in joy."
10,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/258616-liz-de-coster,2,"An okay introduction to skepticism, but I'm wondering if the language will appeal to real ""newbies"". Certainly it's important to be specific and precise when possible, but if the basic terminology includes phrases like ""neuropsychological humility"" it might be difficult for some readers to engage with the material."
11,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27470888-cool-breeze,3,"This book is a bit of a mixed bag. It contains a good introduction to, or refresher on, skeptical thinking and logical pitfalls and fallacies, although that part is long and drags after several hundred pages. The examples generally make for more enjoyable reading when they finally arrive.When the book moves to examples, I agree with nearly all of its targets. Some are treated relatively gently and humorously (the Loch Ness monster, ghosts, UFOs and aliens). However, the authors beat certain topics well past death (intelligent design, antivaxxers, medical quackery). I can understand their outrage when medical quackery kills or injures people, but it still gets tedious if you got their point many pages back. I don’t think traditional religious beliefs deserve the same level of abuse, provided they are not injuring people, although I otherwise agree with the authors. Also, the authors largely ignore the fact that, as traditional religious beliefs have declined, they have been supplanted by new-age religious beliefs, particularly Gaia worship, which they don’t treat with the same level of hostility.The few partial exceptions where I don’t completely agree with the book are anthropogenic global warming (AGW, discussed below), the alleged gender pay gap (barely mentioned, but uncritically accepted as due to discrimination) and, unimportantly, TWA flight 800 (briefly mentioned to dismiss the testimony of many eyewitnesses, but other evidence is ignored).I think the authors have a huge blind spot with regard to AGW. The issue isn’t just whether the planet is warming, but include 1) how much, 2) how much human activity is contributing to that vs. solar and planetary cycles, ice age cycles and other factors, 3) whether that is something that warrants such alarm as to justify draconian changes to the national and world economy and probably a significant curtailment of freedom and lowering of living standards and 4) if so, whether China and other countries get a free pass to continue making the purported problem worse while Western countries shoulder nearly all of the burden of mitigation. The authors completely ignore the fact that the same AGW advocates have been sounding the same dire warnings with the same prescriptions (dramatic expansion of government control and restriction of private activity) for so long that they were within living memory once just as adamant that the threat was “global cooling”, then “global warming”, then “climate change”, then “climate crisis” and now “climate emergency”. Chicken Little has been screeching that the sky is falling for far too long.The authors also ignore that fact that AGW embraces several logical pitfalls that the book otherwise criticizes: 1) its advocates refuse to disclose their data (the disgraceful Michael Mann, who embarrassingly contributed the first blurb to this book, was found in contempt of court), 2) there is evidence that the data is being cooked (“hide the decline”) and narratives being shaped by the selection of biased gatekeeper IPCC authors, 3) its advocates are not very good about making accurate or falsifiable predictions with their theory, 4) its advocates are notorious for moving the goal posts (the polar ice caps and glaciers were supposed to have melted long before now, snow was supposed to be a thing of the past, etc.), 5) there is a strong component of the “appeal to nature” fallacy (which has its own chapter), that whatever is “natural” is good and whatever is “man-made” is bad, and 6) many of the advocates are subject to enormous pressures of “motivated reasoning”, with tons of grant money, fame and fawning media coverage (Scoldilocks), gigantic economic winners and losers, and nearly unlimited government power at stake. I am aware that questioning the motives of AGW advocates has the potential to be a fallacy itself, but the financial and social pressures for motivated reasoning are much stronger with regard to AGW than in any other area.Ironically, the book contains a chapter mocking the smorgasbord of trendy but fallacious beliefs in “Holly-woo” and the West coast. It also criticizes the widespread politically-correct but fallacious opposition to GMOs. Yet it ignores the fact that AGW is the ultimate sacred cow of trendy, politically-correct beliefs. The authors accept the dubious proposition that a meta-survey which found that 33% of scientists endorsed AGW constitutes a “97 % consensus” (of a few degrees warming), and peremptorily concludes ‘case closed’ - “deniers” are anti-science and should shut up and get with the program. There is no discussion of the quality of the evidence, faulty and unfalsifiable predictions, the relative contributions of non-anthropogenic effects, positive and negative consequences and their magnitude, the motivated reasoning of vehemently statist and anti-capitalist advocates, or mitigation strategies that minimize the oppressive expansion of government power and the impact on individual freedoms and living standards. The authors’ skepticism has its limits when it would really make them pariahs among their circle at Yale. Remember, the lead author is the guy who was taken in by Loose Change 9/11 conspiracy theories because Bush=Hitler, or something. This was before McCain=Hitler and Romney=Hitler and Trump=Hitler, for those keeping score at home.The book would have benefited from more discussion of examples where the “scientific consensus” turned out to be wrong, for instance mad cow disease (BSE/vCJD) and prions. Galileo, bloodletting, relativity, and quantum mechanics are very briefly mentioned, but soft-pedaled. The book might also have benefited from some discussion of the social bias exemplified by Pauline Kael, who infamously couldn’t understand why Nixon won because “I live in a rather special world. I only know one person who voted for Nixon. Where they are I don’t know. They’re outside my ken. But sometimes when I’m in a theater I can feel them”. Scientists and skeptics are more susceptible to groupthink than they would like to admit."
12,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4627768-fawwaz,5,Essential read. This book is probably in my top 5 non-fiction books. It basically teaches you all about critical thinking. It's dense with information but still manages to be easy to read. It contains around 60 chapters with very different topics and doesn't spend too long discussing one idea. It's also written like a guide that you could refer back to.It talks about the limitations of our brain and how it can sometimes deceive us into seeing things that are not really there. Then it goes to talk about the biases and fallacies that we could fall into. It describes how science works and what differentiates it from pseudoscience with some enjoyable/scary tales from history.This book is also based on a podcast that has been running for years (same name). They decided to collect all their ideas in one book. I will definitely be a listener now.
13,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30775367-tobias,5,"This book reaffirms what I learned from ""Predictably Irrational"" and similar books – humans suck. Our minds are unreliable, our thinking defaults to all kinds of logical fallacies, and we're naturally biased, hubristic, narrow-minded, unjust, and anything but how we love to portrait ourselves.Thankfully, we have a set of methods to help us navigate this world; primarily logic and the scientific method.Besides painting a bleak picture of our human nature, this handbook in skeptical thinking also educates on how to overcome our shortcomings. How to stay humble and first and foremost question what we think we know ourselves. It contains a plethora of tools for how to break down illogical arguments, how to recognize and debunk pseudoscience, and how to respond to quackery.The Skeptic's Guide to the Universe should be required reading in all schools."

16,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18293816-bill-leach,3,"Four stars for the first section, slowly declining through the rest of the book.This book has a great introductory section which reviews the mechanisms that underlie human perception, and how they can lead to incorrect assessments. This is followed by chapters on logical errors in argument and the effects of bias. Novella looks at the use of Occam's Razor to identify the most likely explanation in a set of alternatives. Conversely, he shows the effects of confirmation bias and p-hacking in arriving at incorrect conclusions.The author then examines a number of issues of dubious validity, including free energy, quantum woo and ghosts. Surprising that many religions still practice exorcism, the Roman Catholic Church has 500-600 exorcists worldwide and revised their procedures as recently as 1999! While it is interesting to re-examine this variety of strange ideas, most are sufficiently extreme that most thinking people would realize their vacuous nature. Other chapters, such as the one on GMO's are detailed and informative. Novella has a chapter on epigenetics, but it is mostly an amazingly vitriolic criticism of an article by an Brad Church and provides little insight.Novella looks at denialism, calling it a subset of pseudoscience, and suggests that exists on a spectrum with skepticism. He notes that people tend to use themselves for calibration: anyone more skeptical than you is a denier, and anyone less skeptical is a true believer.Chapter 47 is entitled ""False Balance"" wherein the author talks about the desirability of presenting both sides of an argument - but if the ""cons"" are seen as deniers, it becomes a false balance as it misrepresents the issue. In such cases he feels that the need for a balanced presentation disappears!Early on, Novella seems to acknowledge that much of science is unknown or not clearly established - in the intro he says ""Science is still a messy and flawed process, but it is a process."" However, later chapters reveal that Novella is quite binary in his view of what is scientific. He explains why ideas like vaccination are scientifically valid, but reviews many that he views strongly are not.Some parts are quite funny. He relates how impressed he was with the movie ""Loose Change"" about 911. He then relates his conversation with his partners, where he is derided for showing interest in the ideas portrayed in the film. Amazingly, the conversation is all about opinion not facts. The author has no time for conspiracy theories, as it is unlikely larger groups can contain them. However, recent history has shown that false flag events are part of the toolkit regularly used by certain major countries.The author's discussion of placebos is surprising. while there is no mechanism for placebo effects, it is clear that they often provide positive benefits for the simple reason that patients believe they are effective. This is real and many alternative therapies recognize and take advantage of the effects. However, the author sees this as insidious, possibly drawing people away from mainstream medicine.While Novella has a reasonable discussion of the concepts of statistical analysis, including the concepts of false positives and false negatives, he misses a major contributor to false results - modelling. While the underlying mechanisms and inherent assumptions may be poorly understood, the results are considered as if the model were totally correct - in fact, models are often considered to be evidence themselves.Novella reveals his true skepticism in a final chapter on global warming. He starts with extended similes of questionable validity: asteroid impact and lymes disease. He falls back on the idea of consensus, demonstrating a fundamental lack of understanding of the mechanism of science. He unintentionally gets it right when he observes ""The real problem we are facing is a political one, not a scientific one."" While he notes that ""This model [IPCC model] is not controversial; it is now a well-established fact."", two paragraphs later he observes that it ""... is an extremely simplistic model .."" and the modelling ""...is extremely intricate, which results in a large range of possible outcomes."" Statements such as that scientists "".. have essentially ruled everything else out ..."" and ""The climate is warming faster than at any time in the last two million years."" show that Novella has not looked into the facts - hardly a skeptical approach!The final chapter - ""Being Skeptical"" - is embarrassingly vapid. One would think that this would be an opportunity to suggest some techniques for evaluating ideas to the reader, but instead Novella suggests being able to change your mind, avoiding being judgmental, humble,nurturing and courageous."

However, in disclosing that, I think educational books like this are important to have in your reading diet no matter who you are - even if it's just a friendly reminder to check your own biases and misperceptions. In fact, books like this are arguably more important than ever to help people be informed consumers of information. I highly recommended this book for the skeptically inclined and recommended it even more for those who are not."
19,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4153215-rusty,5,"I was having lunch with a very dear friend of mine last summer and, as is often the case, our conversation turned towards religion, the supernatural, aliens, conspiracies and all sorts of fun topics like that. At one point in our conversation I was picking up on a theme in all of these topics, he believes in them all. Alien ghosts conspiring with devil worshiping billionaires to put aborted fetuses into school lunches? Yeah, sounds legit. And, to be clear, this guy is no dummy. I generally consider him one of my smartest friends. But at the same time I don’t think he understands standards of evidence, or burden of proof, or even something like Occam’s razor – or, to be honest, why methodological materialism is a necessity when trying to explore the world around us. And as a friend, he’s not interested in my PowerPoint presentations on those topics. We’re having a conversation. But during this real conversation we were having, I did bring up all those things, and he disagreed with me that they are important in uncovering the truth about a claim. I told him something very close to this: “If what you are saying to me is how you really behave when confronted with a claim from someone, then you are at risk of being bamboozled by virtually every huckster that crosses your path.”He shrugged at that. I hope it was because he was profoundly struck by what I said and needed a moment to reflect on his life, but I suspect it was because he was briefly taken aback by how directly I confronted him on the issue (in person, I’m usually much more placating than I was in that moment).But as time goes on, I get increasingly frustrated (and therefore, less patient) at how more and more often, people thrust nonsense in my face and are offended that I don’t accept it as literal truth. I’m not personally insulting you if I don’t think crop circles are actually attempts at alien communication with the citizens of earth – but when you have people confessing to creating them, then demonstrating how they create them, and doing so in exhaustive detail - why would you think them liars? Especially when there is no evidence to support aliens from space. I mean, there is a whole host of problems that come up when you start seriously looking into the possibility of alien activity. Not the least of which is: why?Whatever, my point is, if I have one, that this book is much needed. It’s a pretty good list of all the ways our intuition leads us the wrong way. It’s about how easily tricked we are, and provides example after example of the myriad of ways our thinking is just flat-out wrong.I recommend this book. Unfortunately, the people I think need it most are the ones least likely to read it. Too bad. Also, I’d point out that the author(s) runs a podcast dedicated to critical thinking. I’ve been listening almost since I first discovered podcasts, somewhere along the lines of 2007 or early 2008. Wow. Time flies. Regardless, I’m a fan of the show. It may color how I rated the book. I dunno. Just providing full disclosure here."
20,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57803005-tomas-sedovic,5,"A huge caveat to this review: the authors of this book are hosting a weekly podcast (of the same name) I've been keenly listening to for 7 years. They feel like friends I've never met and this has certainly coloured my views of the book.That said, it's fantastic. I love it.The Skeptic's Guide is not about automatic doubt and dismissal of everything as the title might suggest. It is about the exploration of scientific scepticism -- how to approach claims and investigate whether (or how likely) they are correct and why might people believe otherwise.It contains discussions on the methods of science, workings of the human brain and the various ways one can deceive oneself. A good portion of the book is a sort of encyclopedia with entries documenting various logical fallacies (errors in thinking and argumentation), phenomena such as free energy devices, alternative medicine, UFO, homeopathy, fake news, science reporting, organic food, and the media. Included is discussion on hypnagogia -- one of my favourite seemingly insane state of consciousness that a lot of people don't know about and that can seriously confuse and freak you out.I have also thoroughly enjoyed the section on cold reading. I've tried to indulge the authors in their ""remote attempt to read my mind"" and it was spooky how successful it ended up being.Next, the authors each shared a personal story of their own investigation and inquiry. I have found Steve Novella's journey around GMOs particularly fascinating. It is an area full of misinformation, propaganda and strong opinions.What follows is a mercifully short chapter on ""death by pseudoscience"". With a chilling clarity, it addresses the ""what's the harm?"" dismissal of the various nonscientific beliefs and approaches. It is this chapter that made me literally cry out loud. And then sob. There seem to be no bounds to the horrific acts people can do under misguided beliefs.The book is broadly agnostic towards any religion. To the extent that one's faith stays outside of testable scientific questions, it is left alone.What does get addressed are factual, testable claims. E.g. a belief in an Earth that is a few thousand years old would be challenged, but any claims on the existence of the supernatural would not be. Science has clear boundaries and limits and this book follows follows them.It is a book I would recommend everyone to read. It will help broaden your horizons and navigate the pitfalls common to everyone's thinking. It will also help expose common scams and deceptions people have, are and will be using to sell you stuff or convince you of something that is not true.The actual claims and facts the book presents are indeed the less important aspect. They may be made obsolete by new evidence, after all. It's the patterns of thought and awareness of our own cognitive limitations that will stay relevant and useful."
21,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49890950-ram-s,4,"This book covers scientific skepticism as a way of approaching life. The most important section is the tools being laid out for the reader in order to evaluate things skeptically. These are neuropsychological humility, metacognition, promotion of science/reason/critical thinking, detecting pseudo science, free enquiry and consumer protection. These chapters provide scientific basis for why skeptical thought is necessary both as a means of self reflection as well as observing reality. I found them interestingly compiled although today many books like Thinking Fast and Think Slow or Predictably Irrational can cover say the aspect of meta-cognition. The discussion on logical fallacies is quite deep and guides us against various tall reaching claims made by overly confident scientific studies (p-hacking) or scientific denialism (like global warming denial) and builds a toolkit to assess such claims. It is followed by some tales from past history which can help sharpen the person skeptical toolkit although I should say I was familiar with examples like Clever Hans, Vitalism or Ponzi Schemes.The next section is a bit of a tacking of current issues like GMO, Ghosts, 9/11 which I felt was not that useful as it did not tie to the previous sections but seemed more like story telling. Hence I reduced 1 star.The next section tackled skepticism in the media which is a hot button topic in this age of fake news and I guess being news-literate is important to us in which atleast many major Indian TV channels and some publications resort to putting ideological political spin on every story. The next section shows how not being skeptical leads to death and gives a few examples which was passable but again it was too much story telling.The last section on practical advice on skepticism is good and gives tips on cultivating a skeptical habit not just to question others and their beliefs but also to evaluate biases and belief structures in ones own self. Continuous learning and a curious and open mind seems to be the authors recommendations. The advice on parenting was useful although my daughter naturally is inclined to think scientifically (she wants to be an astrophysicist).As an Indian, I see pseudoscience everywhere not only in my close friends and family (Homeopathy, Organic Food, GMO hatred or Yoga curing cancer) but also in the media. This will be a definite vaccination for any Indian whose constitution states it is the fundamental duty of a citizen to cultivate a scientific temper.I check out the facebook group of the SGU and it seems very active so I enrolled and plan to be a part of the continuing conversation."

It touches on a wide range of topics such as biases, logical fallacies, conspiracy theories, witch hunts, homeopathy, pyramid schemes, GMOs, alternative medicine, paranormal activity, fake news, micro biome, epigenetics, among many others. Some topics they go into too much depth on, and others were too shallow. One problem I had is their complete disregard for any truth received from faith...it is either proven or observed scientifically, or it is not true. Be aware that this is touched on many times in this book. I did find the discussion on memories very interesting and I will share some favorite quotes on them below. Overall, I liked their push to be more inquisitive, to look at things from other perspectives, and to be humble about what we know (and don't know). -Memories are flawed. ""Memories are constructed from imperfect perceptions filtered through our beliefs and biases and over time they morph and merge. Our memories serve more to support our beliefs than to inform them. In a way, they are an evolving story we tell ourselves.""-Memories are malleable. ""Memories are flawed from the moment we construct them, but they're also not stable over time. Each time we recall a memory we are actually reconstructing and updating it. We alter memories to fit our internal narratives about reality and as those narratives change, we update our memories to fit them.""-We all need to be humble when it comes to the accuracy of our own memories and perceptions. -We all have cognitive biases. Self assess and err on the side of humility. If you assume you know relatively less than you think you do and that there is more knowledge that you aren't aware of, then you will usually be correct.-If you want to test your hypothesis, try to prove it wrong, don't just look for evidence that it's right - confirmation bias"

The subtitle says it all: ""How to Know What's Really Real in a World Increasingly Full of Fake."" ""The Sceptic's Guide"" is a primer for developing the critical thinking and analytical skills that just may save us from the flood of pseudoscience, misinformation, and outright superstition that threatens centuries of hard-won enlightenment. It does not pretend to be an easy fix. A good part of the book is devoted to an explanation of just why it is so difficult for us to think logically. Our brains aren't really built for it, and the discussion of why this is so is one of the most interesting parts of the book. It takes discipline; commitment; and an awareness of the limitations in memory, perception, and cognition that we all have in common. Tired of social media rants and nonsense? Run, do not walk, to the nearest book store (or go online to Amazon) and buy ""The Sceptic's Guide."" You won't regret it."
24,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21136796-boni-aditya,4,"A few years ago when I first came across Logical Fallacies, Biases, Pseudo Sciences, Frauds, and other errors in Science. I wanted to create an encyclopedia to capture all the errors in human judgement that have been made since time immemorial. Well, needless to say, i have not done it. But, this book can serve that purpose, it has a list of all such errors carefully codified, along with the type of error that was committed. This book has helped me shatter many nonsense claims in one go. In fact hundreds of them. At the time of reading this book, I was carefully being pulled into a new age doctors pseudo Scientific claims, I was watching his Facebook group and his videos, I have also make a list of the books that he suggests during his videos, unsuspecting of the Echo Chamber he was creating for me. It was a carefully knit web of one pseudo science supporting the other, as the author has discussed in one of the chapters. The Doctors name is B.M.Hegde, who was pushing homeopathy and other pseudo sciences in the Indian medical circuit, and shows all the characteristics that Steven Novella described about a Pseudo Scientists and the Conspiracy theorist, the doctor showed almost all the traits, like lack of humbleness, and self-congratulatory pat on the back and conspiracy theory against modern science and using quantum theory to justify his absurd claims. I was amazed, I thanked my friend for suggesting this book me to. There was another such proponent of spirituality - Sadhguru, by name, who is also spreading pseudo science to justify foolish Indian Rituals and superstitions that were passed down to Indians for generations. I think this book is a shield against such foolishness. Not only does it shield me but also shield my friends and family, for I can quickly look up a particular chapter and read it out to them, instead of having to remember myriad of errors and then recollect them on demand. The book is extremely good till CHAPTER 39 - After which it descends into a podcast. The book is derived from the podcast entries of the author. But a book should not become a podcast, i.e. a casual discussion of their adventures and their real life happenings. From Chapter 39 to Chapter 56+ till the book ends. It was just anecdotal and a reiteration of the very strong tenets that the author discussed in the previous 39 chapters.May be that is why I could not give it the five star ratings it deserves. The author should have published this in two smaller volumes, the first one containing the theory and the second one containing the practice.

I highly recommend it to anyone who loves science, wants to think more critically, or aid in knowledgeable discussion"
27,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9354330-aaron,4,"It never fails... I'm scrolling through social media, and I come across some piece of what is clearly pseudoscientific jargon about a miracle cure, or a badly fabricated piece of fake news. And while my immediate instinct is to jump into the comment section fray, ready to decimate all comers with a blast of pure logic and good common sense, this first thought is immediately followed by others: well, what's the blatantly obvious hole in their argument? If I were to put in my two cents, how could I word it so that they couldn't dismiss me just as easily as I am dismissing them? And, perhaps most importantly, is it even worth the effort? Will anyone's mind be changed?After reading The Skeptic's Guide to the Universe (the weekly podcast version of which I've been a fan for a while now), I feel a little better armored against this ever-present wall of media information that seems determined to fool me. Which it does sometimes, I hate to admit. But Dr. Steven Novella and his contributors (co-hosts of his podcast, each with a chapter of their own) say not to worry; the point of science is sometimes (even often!) being wrong, but having the ability to acknowledge, admit, and alter your point of view when your old one is proved obsolete.That, he says, is what having a ""skeptical"" mindset (used in the best sense, meaning reluctant to flatly accept someone's word without questioning) is all about. It's actually the antithesis of the immediate-outrage machine that fuels much of our social interactions these days. He boils it all down quite nicely in this statement: the answer to any given scientific question is always more complex than you think. The worst part about the human mind is that we crave simple answers to complex questions, and sometimes it's easier to think the world is run by a secret cabal than to really understand the chaos inherent in human societies. That's not to say you can't be right believing in things like vaccines or climate change, but simply to be aware of how tightly the mind can cling to things it wishes were true. Examine not only the evidence, but the sources of the evidence, and the weigh its veracity for yourself.After reading SGU: The Book, I do feel a little bit better armored against the world of misinformation, my bs-detector a little more finely tuned. That being said, however, this book is not going to effortlessly lead us all into the blazing light of Unassailable Truth, nor does it in any way claim that it will. Instead, it's a preparatory step on the path that each of us must tread through the thickets of half-truths and superstition, one that we must work at through our entire mind's life of learning and understanding. And while there will be opportunities to point the way out to people along the way, they most likely will not follow. Nevertheless, the truth will win out. It always does, eventually."
28,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7240015-stephen,5,"...wow. Okay, so...back in 2006 I found a weekly podcast that was so consistently good that, even on a dial-up connection, I had no problem spending four or five hours every week downloading it, just for an hour of content. It was The Skeptic's Guide to the Universe, hosted by several brothers and a couple of friends, sharing science, skeptic, and tech news, playing games, etc. It often featured scientists like Neil deGrasse Tyson and Richard Dawkins as interviewees, and was for a long time my absolute favorite podcast. I still listen to it on a regular basis thirteen years later, and I never had any doubt that I'd buy and read this book. However, I didn't. Instead, I discovered that there was an audible version.....featuring the primary host of the show, Steven Novella. So I listened to SGU Audible, instead, and -- well, it was delightful, and even opens with the SGU theme music. Here's the short version: The Skeptic's Guide to the Universe is the best guide to critical thinking since Carl Sagan's The Demon-Haunted World, and even surpasses Sagan as far as depth of content goes. If you're a regular listener of SGU, there's added appeal is not only choice of narrator, but the fact that it ends with the entire SGU panel talking about the podcast and the creation of the book.When this book calls itself ""The Skeptic's Guide to the Universe"", it's not kidding. This is not a one-off work to take advantage of the podcast's popularity, filled with little more than transcripts of old interviews. It's a fat ol' book, with a table of contents that runs three pages. It opens with core concepts that everyone should keep in mind, moves to logical fallacies and the like, tackles pseudoscience both historical and contemporary, addresses the media and Hollywood, and -- by way of ending -- dips into the grim results of persistent irrationality before offering ways to change ourselves and the world. Make no mistake: the target of this Skeptic's Guide is the reader, and that's obvious from the very beginning when Novella addresses the frailty of memory, as well as other mental snags like our hyperactive pattern recognition. The skeptical ""rogues"" as they term themselves are no strangers to mistakes, as Novella shares later on; we all have blind spots. I was also taken with the section on trying to communicate with people; one tactic Novella suggests is finding common ground between the skeptic (on a particular issue) and the believer, or something they both disbelieve in -- and trying to find a connection from there. The focus of Novella and company is to find a path to the truth, not prove oneself's right.As much as I enjoyed listening to a familiar voice for nigh sixteen hours, framed by familiar music, given the sheer amount of content I find myself wishing now I had read the physical book. For one thing, it's harder to take notes on an audio book, especially when you're out doing laps or playing Civilization III. (I was playing Civ3 more often than doing laps, alas.) I'm going to keep my eyes open for a used copy and possibly revisit this one. It's an excellent resource as well as a fun read, and the panel discussion at the end of the audiobook indicated there are more books on the way. I'm eagerly anticipating them!"
29,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22356256-kyle,5,"I have followed Steven Novella's blog for quite a while and have found his analyses to be nicely balanced and reasoned. So I thought I may as well give his book a shot. I was expecting more of an overarching story about skepticism, but it was more like a bunch of entries in an encyclopedia (this is not meant to be a bad thing; I am just saying each chapter is more-or-less self-contained). This is not to say that this is a bad book, just that it was not what I expected. I considered giving it 4 stars because of this slight disappointment in story-structure, but after thinking about this, the structure does make sense and so I would not say that it was a bad decision. Especially if you are looking for a good description of logical fallacies, cognitive biases, and some stories that illustrate critical thinking skills, this is an excellent book. It explains how we think, how we are very susceptible to tricking ourselves into thinking we are unaffected by such biases, and is just a good overview of how to try and think carefully about what the evidence says. Everyone is susceptible to overconfidence, and it takes constant vigilance to keep yourself from assuming you are right.I definitely enjoyed the book. If you are curious what skepticism is about, and some good ways to think critically, this is a book I'd definitely recommend. It would work well to just peruse a couple of sections each day, as most of the chapters do not depend on reading all the ones before it. If you are already know all about skepticism, there won't be much new here, but it will be a nice one-stop shop for any terms you may need to review about human biases."
30,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26089999-anu,5,"In the past, I’d often have arguments about whether I remembered a certain incident accurately or not. The brain does a better job of remembering the emotion associated with a memory rather than the actual details of the incident itself. Knowing this would have saved me some of those arguments 🙂 The first section on metacognition was a great compilation of mental calisthenics and how/why our brain tricks us easily. Having a vocabulary of cognitive biases is helpful in self awareness too.I have never listened to the podcast, so all of the content was fresh for me. The bit on GMO was well researched, the pieces on homeopathy and UFOs were mildly interesting. The ones on free energy and ESP were meh. I’ve been wary of the skeptics crowd, for much the same reason as the EA crowd - it sometimes feels a bit too academic and lacking in spirit. However, the authors have done a great job of deconstructing critical thinking and providing examples of its application. Can’t argue that the world needs this today, more than ever. "

After all that, I can't say that I feel much more armed against the misinformation, other than now having an increased awareness of how to face the overwhelming onslaught of ideas flying at me from all directions. Basically, the book says that if it doesn't withstand scientific scrutiny, it isn't true. We need to keep an open mind, check closely what the original source is, decide if the source is credible and if the info passes muster. In my humble opinion, there are many things that can never be definitively proven but that doesn't necessarily mean they must be dismissed. The book is interesting and informative but does get somewhat boring at times."

The second half...bugged me at first, because he's just spent alllllll this time talking about how we're all wrong sometimes and we all have weird brains and bad memories, and then he launches into something that kiiind of comes across as, ""well, except for me!"" Which, you know, I found annoying. But then he turns around and tells a story about how he believed something dumb, and I started liking the book again, although, really I was more in it for the first part and not so much for the list of all the things people think that are wrong. That said, I have never listened to the podcast, and know nothing about these guys and their skeptics community. The book made me slightly interested in maybe listening to an episode at some point, only I think we've already established that I am absolutely rubbish at keeping up with podcasts, so it will probably not actually happen. Even so, this book was interesting, and will definitely make me question my own perceptions and memories more often!"

This book is a fairly good, compact distillation of the sorts of things you'll get out of listening to the podcast, which is great for people not looking to listen to a huge back catalogue of SGU episodes.That said, I am not sure exactly what the best audience for this book is. I liked it at least partially as a nostalgia trip, because I fondly remember back when skepticism was a big thing on the internet, back before the rationalist diaspora. I don't think that this book is compelling enough to persuade people not already inclined to skepticism that this is a good approach to thinking, [1] but it's also not a particularly in-depth resource for hardened skeptics. I think probably the right audience is someone like me 13 years ago, when I first started listening to SGU: someone who has a basically skeptical outlook, but doesn't really know the breadth of irrationality going on out there.3.5 of 5 stars[1] In some ways, not being compelling is a good thing, because in my experience, the way people think in stories and heuristics makes it so that the most compelling writing tends to be deceptive in some way."

A big part of that process is science, which systematically tests our ideas against reality, using the most objective data possible. Science is still a messy and flawed process, but it is a process. It has, at least, the capacity for self-correction, to move our beliefs incrementally in the direction of reality. In essence, science is the process of making our best effort to know what's really real.""The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe is a handy guide to skepticism from the same people behind the The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe podcast. I get the impression Dr. Steven Novella wrote most of it, although the other co-hosts of the podcast contribute as well. Fans of the podcast will find much of this material familiar, although there are a few new bits. Even if you already know most of this information, it's still nice to have the biggest take-aways from the 700+ episodes all in one place. So, for those unfamiliar with the term, what is skepticism?Scientific skepticism isn't simply doubting everything, but rather doubting ideas which are not supported by science. Science isn't perfect, but as long as it's done correctly, it's the best method we have for eliminating bias. In addition to promoting science, Skepticism also promotes reason and critical thinking in order to expose fraud and pseudoscience.The first core concept that is covered is memory. Something everyone needs to accept in order to be a skeptic is that our memories are unreliable. Each time we recall a memory, we change it. This is why the fish that got away keeps getting bigger with every telling of the story. The way our brains store memories is messy. Different memories get combined together. Sometimes you remember something you observed or someone else's memory as if it's your own. We invent details to fill in gaps. False memories can be created through hypnosis, guided imagery, suggestion, or group pressure. Police can convince innocent people they committed a crime through lengthy interrogation. Confidence in a memory doesn't make it more likely to be true.In the 1980s, many therapists believed traumatic memories get repressed and can be uncovered through hypnosis and other techniques. In actuality, the therapists were creating false memories in their patients without realizing they were doing it. These false memories led to the Satanic Panic in which many people remembered witnessing child sacrifices and being abused by satanic cults, even though nobody has ever uncovered any evidence that satanic cults such as these even exist. Many innocent people were sent to jail and many families were torn apart as a result of false memory syndrome.Optical illusions demonstrate that we can't always trust our senses. Our perceptions are constructed by our brains. Your brain actually changes what you see based on what it's expecting to see, projects movement into the future, fills in your blind spots, makes your two dimensional perception appear three dimensional, makes the blurry images around the center of your vision appear clear, and more. We can easily mistake something small and close for something big and far away, especially when we're looking into the sky.Pareidolia is seeing an image in random noise such as the man in the moon or images in clouds. It also applies to sound, such as hearing messages in songs played backwards. Expectation plays a huge role, so you'll see or hear what someone else tells you to expect. Our brains are especially disposed to see faces, which is why so many peoples see the Virgin Mary in tree bark or Jesus in a piece of toast.The ideomotor effect is a subtle muscle movement driven by expectation that can be found in dowsing, facilitated communication, or people using Ouija boards. This may seem like harmless fun, but businessman James McCormick made millions selling a modified dowsing rod to detect bombs. It didn't work and likely resulted in hundreds of deaths in Iraq alone.The Dunning-Kruger Effect is everyone's tendency to overestimate their own knowledge in areas outside their expertise due to the fact we're ignorant of how ignorant we are. Everyone thinks they're above average. Those who know the most in a subject underestimate their knowledge a little bit. Those who know the least overestimate how much they know the most. This is because ignorance isn't a lack of knowledge, but rather possession of incorrect knowledge which gives us unwarranted confidence.People will usually accept new information as long as it doesn't conflict with an emotional belief that's part of their identity. When this is challenged, they engage in motivated reasoning, defending their belief illogically and dismissing inconvenient facts. It's human nature, but we can try to avoid it by not getting emotionally attached to factual beliefs that might turn out to be wrong.When arguing with someone, it's best to apply the principle of charity and give the other person the benefit of the doubt. Keep in mind that the goal of an argument shouldn't be to win, but to have the most valid position. This sometimes means changing your own mind.There are many informal logical fallacies that get used in arguments such as the argument from authority. This is when you state something is true because an authority figure says it's true, but this is a fallacy because authorities aren't always right. For example, Nobel laureate Linus Pauling was a brilliant man, but he was wrong about vitamin C helping fight off infections like the common cold.Post hoc ergo propter hoc is the fallacy that because B happened after A, A must have caused B. This is a fallacy because lots of things could have caused B to happen. A is just one of several things that came before. For example, many people think alternative medicine works because they get better after taking it. However, we often recover from illnesses without doing anything at all, so there's no evidence the alternative medicine actually did anything. It's just taking credit for what the immune system naturally does.Just because two things seem to be related, doesn't mean they actually are. In the 1990s, both religious attendance and drug use were on the rise. If you claimed rising drug use caused a rise in religious attendance, you'd be confusing correlation with causation. Just because two things are correlated doesn't mean one caused the other. They could have both been caused by a third thing (like social unrest), or they could have just coincidentally both increased at the same time. It's important to consider all possibilities.An ad hominen attack is when you attack the person making the argument rather than the argument itself. Even if the person you disagree with is the worst human who ever existed, it doesn't necessarily mean their argument is wrong.The argument from ignorance is a logically fallacy which states that a belief is true because we don't know that it isn't true. An example of this is the God of the gaps argument. Whenever there's a gap in scientific knowledge (such as not knowing how the universe first began), some people will say the answer is God did it. But this is a fallacy because if we don't know something, all we can honestly say is we don't know something.A false dichotomy is compressing numerous possibilities into just two. For example, arguing that ghosts exist because someone said they saw one and we know they aren't a liar. This is a false dichotomy because there's much more than just two possibilities. The ghost sighting could have been caused by an optical illusion, a false memory, a hallucination, or numerous other possibilities we haven't thought of.A false analogy is saying because two things are similar in one way, they must be similar in others. An example of this is saying because both watches and humans are complex, they both must have been created by an intelligence. However, this is a false analogy because watches and humans are different in many ways. A better analogy is comparing evolution to an unplanned city that gets added to in a haphazard way but still works because people change the city to fit their needs. Creationism can be compared to a planned city which was entirely designed from the ground up and thus doesn't have any haphazard additions being added over time.The nirvana fallacy is when someone says that if something isn't perfect, it's worthless. This is untrue because something can be better than nothing even if it isn't perfect. The Slippery slope argument is when someone claims accepting a position also entails accepting an extreme of that position, which isn't necessarily true. A straw man argument is when you argue against a weaker version of your opponent's argument. You should argue against what they actually said rather than an easier-to-defeat argument. The reverse of this is the steel man in which you argue against a stronger version of their argument in order to be as fair to their position as possible.The fallacy fallacy is when you say someone is wrong because they committed a logical fallacy, but this doesn't necessarily mean that they're wrong. Their argument could be terrible, but they still might be right.Confirmation bias is the tendency to interpret new information in support of a previously held belief. In other words, you count the hits but not the misses. This is done unconsciously. For example, a man might insist he always puts the toilet seat down while his wife insists he always leaves it up. This is because the man puts the toilet seat down every time he remembers to put it down, but doesn't remember the times he forgets. From his point of view, he always puts it down. From the woman's point of view, he always leaves it up because she only remembers the times when it's up.The appeal to nature is the belief that natural is better, but just because something is natural doesn't mean it's good for us. Many plants are poisonous, for example. The most toxic substance known is botulinum toxin which is all natural. The vast majority of food has been tinkered with by humans for hundreds or thousands of years so most of what we eat isn't natural. Vitamin C found in nature and Vitamin C created in a lab are exactly the same. One isn't inferior because it's artificial. The organic food industry considers highly toxic pesticides such as copper sulfate and rotenone okay because they are ""natural"", but this is just a marketing ploy. Natural isn't automatically better than artificial. It's even worse in many cases.The organic industry claims GMOs (genetically modified organisms) are less safe because they aren't natural, however pretty much all food we eat has already been modified by cultivation, cross-pollination, mutation breeding using radiation or chemicals (which is considered organic farming for some reason), or hybridization. Raspberries are one of the few things which haven't been genetically modified by humans over the years. The organic industry claims it's unnatural to put a fish gene in a tomato, but fish and tomatoes share 60 perfect of their genes already. There's really no such thing as a ""fish gene"". It's all just genes. In reality, GMOs are just as safe and natural as organic food. They're actually safer since they're tested more extensively. Also, directly modifying a handful of genes introduces less uncertainty than modifying thousands of genes at once which is what organic farmers do during mutation breeding.The fundamental attribution error is when we think other people's actions are caused by their personality, but our own actions are due to external factors beyond our control. We should never assume things about other people since we don't know everything that's happened to them. We should always strive to give others the same benefit of the doubt we give ourselves.Denialism (such as climate change denial) often masquerades as skepticism, however skepticism accepts science while denialism denies scientific evidence. Denialists are driven by ideology, exaggerate how much doubt there is, ask for more evidence than is possible, and don't change their minds when proven wrong.There's more than one placebo effect, so it's more correct to refer to them as placebo effects. Subjective outcomes (such as a decrease in pain level) are susceptible to several psychological factors. Reporting bias may occur when subjects report they feel better even if they don't. Also, researchers are biased in favor of a positive effect. People take better care of themselves when they decide to pay more attention to their health. Another placebo effect is regression to the mean which is the tendency for things to go back to normal on their own. Symptoms will usually get better over time even if you don't do anything. Belief can have an effect on the subjective experience of pain as can distraction, exercise endorphins, and even cursing. Cancer doesn't have a placebo effect because it's not subjective, it's more physiological. Placebo effects don't require belief, so they also work on animals and babies. A placebo can also make you think you're better when you really aren't. Most alternative medicine is placebo.An anecdote is a story offered as evidence. While personal experience is a form of evidence, it's the weakest form of evidence and isn't useful for testing hypotheses. A personal experience occurs outside of a controlled environment, so it's subject to numerous biases and confounding factors. Anecdotes rely on memory, which is unreliable. Plus, it might be a fluke or the person might have been lying. Why would someone lie about something like seeing a ghost or an alien? Just having an interesting story to tell is motive enough.Psychics use cold reading (a collection of techniques such as making vague statements and employing high probability guesswork) in order to trick people (and sometimes themselves) into thinking they have access to unknown knowledge. Psychics and faith healers also use hot reading which involves getting specific information about people ahead of time using something like social media. Peter Popoff had people fill out prayer cards ahead of time and used these for hot reading.An important take-away from the chapter on quantum woo is that quantum effects don't apply to anything much bigger than an atom, so don't believe anyone who tells you quantum effects apply to your day-to-day life. The chapter on N Rays demonstrates that intelligent people aren't more likely to be good at critical thinking, just better at coming up with rationalizations.Interestingly, positive thinking, which some claim can make your life better, can actually make things worse. In a 1999 study, students who imagined getting good grades actually got worse grades because it distracted them from studying. In fact, research shows pessimism correlates with higher earnings, fewer marital problems, more effective communication, greater generosity, and less disappointment.The internet contains both reliable and unreliable information, so the question is how do we tell the difference? A few things to do are consider if the source is biased, look at a variety of sources, go back to the original source, and listen to both proponents and critics. Also be sure to follow the discussion to the end after all the evidence has come in. Independently examine the arguments to discover which is best. It's okay to reserve judgment if there's not enough evidence for an answer. Consider what the experts have to say. Don't just try to prove yourself right. Seek out experts who have a different opinion than you. Be willing to change your mind when new information is introduced. Your opinions should only be as strong as the evidence.Fake news takes many forms. It can be opinion masquerading as fact, advertising made to look like news, click bait that's made up just to generate advertising dollars, propaganda, or even just straight up lies. Satirical new sites like The Onion are sometimes confused with real news if the humor isn't obvious enough. Ideologues will accuse legitimate news of being fake. All news outlets are going to have biases, of course, but some try harder to be balanced than others. There's a spectrum between real and fake news with no clear dividing line between the two. We should at least do our best not to spread fake news ourselves by not sharing stories on social media until we've verified they're legitimate first.When a particular news outlet, website, or online group only allows stories that confirm what they already believe, this is known as an echo chamber. Social media and search engines actually feed you this type of news automatically because they know people like to have their own opinions repeated back to them. It's important to actively seek out opinions different from our own to avoid wallowing in our biased view of the world.Journalists often strive to be balanced in news reporting, which makes sense when it comes to opinion, but doesn't make sense when it comes to science. When the overwhelming scientific consensus favors one opinion (such as man-made global warming), giving equal time to science deniers is false balance. Unscientific fringe opinions shouldn't be treated as being equally legitimate with well-established science.In order to illustrate that pseudo-scientific beliefs aren't just harmless fun, there are a few chapters detailing some of the deaths caused by pseudo-sciences such as naturopathy and exorcism. Science denier Thabo Mbeki, the President of South Africa from 1999 to 2008, didn't believe HIV is the cause of AIDS. His government therefor denied his people treatment which resulted in over 330,000 deaths. Another chapter deals with a self-proclaimed child behavior expert who killed a child she was supposed to be helping.The final chapter covers how to be skeptical in your everyday life. We should all strive to apply skepticism to ourselves and our own beliefs. We'll never be completely free of bias or error, but we should at least try our best. Being able to change your mind is something to be proud of. Stubbornly refusing to correct an erroneous idea is something to be ashamed of. When dealing with others, consider your strategy and monitor if it works. Listen to what others say and why they believe as they do. Teach them how to think, not what to think. Keep in mind that you might be the one who's wrong.You can't always change someone's mind after one discussion, but you can plant a seed, give them something to think about. Don't be confrontational, explore the question together. Find common ground. Everyone is skeptical of something. Find out what they're skeptical of and build on that. You can't take away someone's narrative without replacing it with another one. Don't point out when someone else is being childish, just act like an adult and lead by example.When it comes to parenting, encourage kids to question everything. Don't just answer their questions, teach them how to think critically. Also, don't talk down to them, they probably know more than you think. Teaching is often the best way to learn, so you may end up learning as just as much as they do.Overall, a highly recommended book. A must for anyone interested in things like objective facts and truth."

I liked the first chapter which defines many things like Occam's Razor and all kinds of other logical fallacies -- things that I have read of hundreds of times, but as a non-native speaker never fully understood what they actually precisely mean.The other chapters fall a bit flat, though. Ironically, in the chapters that are supposed to debunk common bullshit, the author chose some examples that are extremely easy to debunk (like believing in ghosts, or creationism), but somehow the author sneaks in quite a bit of ad-hominem himself and doesn't clearly demonstrate how the framework that was established in the first chapter can be put into praxis in real life.The final two chapters are just tacked on, probably just to sell more copies. There is nothing of value in there.What the entire book is completely lacking are resources! Where do I find proper scientific research? If I can't trust anything that is on the internet and even on traditional media, where the fuck am I supposed to get my information?!Also, the book fails to mention PROBLEMS in the current scientific process. The author just says that ""it is slow and messy but eventually the truth comes to the surface"". The author fails to mention that this system can fail, and has failed many times, due to interests of nation states, powerful mega corporations and even just simply megalomaniac scientists."

One of my favorite things about the podcast is having some of my own long-held beliefs debunked. I've been looking forward to this book for a long time. I'm always telling friends that the podcast is the best primer on critical thinking I've found, and it's so nice to have a format that I can easily share.One of the topics I awaited most eagerly is GM. Even my most skeptical friends are still on the fence on this issue. I recently attended a discussion on the subject. Everyone came prepared – primed with misinformation and fear – by the organizer, no less. Here's some information on Jeffrey Smith, the ""authority"" he promoted (hint: he's total crackpot):https://allianceforscience.cornell.ed...I felt genuinely betrayed by this behavior. The organizer of a forum should be neutral. I was particularly hurt because the topic was one I had suggested, and until that time no one had posted biased information in the comments prior to a discussion. I believe it shows that he does not understand the basics of critical thinking. Which is really weird, since the group is called ""philosophy and critical thinking.""Comments by some participants revealed them as being scientifically illiterate and/or holding an anti-science stance. The GM controversy has been discussed on the SGU podcast through the years, and now it's been condensed into a nice, easy-to-read chapter. Why do people hate Monsanto so much? https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=7Tc8gtZ...There's something in this book for everyone. I hope all my skeptical and non-skeptical friends will read it. I would also hope they listen to the podcast and read blogs that promote scientific skepticism and critical thinking, such as ScienceBlogs, NeuroLogica, Science-Based Medicine, the Genetic Literacy Project, and Debunking Denialism.Other great resources are The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark by Carl Sagan, Thinking, Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman, and The Critical Thinker's Dictionary by Robert Todd Carroll. Books by Michael Lewis and Richard Thaler are good, too. From my reading of these books and others I've learned we have a natural lack of critical thinking skills and a poor understanding of probabilities. We have a propensity to deceive ourselves. The interesting field called behavioral economics addresses those shortcomings and how being made aware of them could make us better thinkers and decision makers. A better understanding of the tactics of medical quackery alone could save not just a whole lot of money, but lives. (You know what they call medicine that's been proven to work? Medicine!)I know everyone doesn't have the time or inclination to read all those books and blogs and listen to hours of podcasts. The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe puts it all in one place in an informative and entertaining manner. It gives you the tools to know how to weigh the claims you encounter and evaluate their truth. This post-truth era is a good time for this excellent, up-to-date baloney detector."

But thinking back Critical thinking is at the core of being a skeptic.This book talks about common cognitive biases which will directly affect what is perceived. Our beliefs shape what we perceive actively. This portion will help raise questions where the evidence rests on the perception of a few. Second, this book talks about common logical fallacies. This section helps us to find weakness in our own arguments as well as in the argument of others. Third, this book lists real interesting events happened in history. This section is a testing ground for knowing what can go wrong when we lack critical thinking. There is also a discussion on Pseudoscience. A point to note is quality of evidence is a continuous spectrum pseudoscience and science rests on this spectrum. Finally, this book does not just have abstract stuff. Sharpening our critical thinking has so much to offer for leading a fulfilling life. It will help us avoid pitfalls when we are most in need. It will help us avoid our own manufactured pitfalls as well. Becoming a good skeptic is a life long journey. This book is an amazing tool to have in that journey! I recommend this book to everyone!"
53,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7827335-sarah,4,"I *LOVED* this book. I found this book very helpful in many ways. First, I was trying to find an into to logic book, and found a whole section on logical fallacies with definitions and examples. Very helpful. Here are some other topics of the book that I found extremely interesting:-Confirmation bias (The tendency to interpret new evidence as confirmation of one's existing beliefs or theories.)-Practical ways of applying skepticism-Heuristics (Any approach to problem solving or self-discovery that employs a practical method, not guaranteed to be optimal, perfect, logical, or rational, but instead sufficient for reaching an immediate goal.)-Evaluating news and investigating sources of informationI also realized while reading the book that being a true skeptic requires a lot of hard work and research which isn't always easy. Being a skeptic also means being comfortable with being wrong or changing views as better information comes into play. This book could be really humbling at times because in one section I would be thinking, ""Oh man, how could anyone believe a conspiracy theory like that?"" and then realizing in the next section that I was guilty of some type of logical fallacy in a discussion I had with someone or guilty of confirmation bias. Altogether a fantastic book and interesting book."

If you told him anything he would reply by rubbing his chin, tilting his head back and in some preposterously cliched attempt at appearing thoughtful he would say, “I don’t know about that, until I see it… I’m pretty skeptical.” He was about as fun as a bag of eggplants. It made me hate whatever skeptical was. That was when I was nine.“Science requires courage—the courage to face reality and accept its findings, even if they upset us or are disruptive to our comfortable ideology.”The Skeptics’ Guide to the Universe - How to Know What’s Really Real in a World Increasingly Full of Fake, by Dr. Steven Novella, is a lot more fun than my cousin / uncle used to be. It is a tour of a world drowning in misinformation, deception, bias and myth and a field guide for how to survive it all.On this tour you will learn what scientific skepticism is and the core concepts it prescribes to. You will come to understand the mechanisms of deception, the failures in our thinking, the difference between science and pseudoscience, hear a bunch of wild tales about wackiness, and finally figure out what to do about the so-called ‘media’.“Don’t panic. This whole notion of thinking for yourself and questioning everything is actually quite fun and empowering. We can do this together.”Most importantly, however, a Skeptics’ Guide to the Universe will teach you how to change yourself into a scientific skeptic of repute. One who is kind, formidable and does not carry themselves around like an obtuse downer.This book is an enlightening and stimulating lesson on how we can separate fact from fiction and why it is so important to be able to do so. That it is only reason and sound thinking can keep civilization afloat in a tsunami of nonsense. And why, if we don’t develop and honor the tool and tenets of skepticism, we may be doomed. All written with a love and compassion for humanity that it probably doesn’t deserve, The Skeptics’ Guide is a gift.Now that I've grown up, read some things, seen some things and experienced some things, I’ve come to believe that that bag of eggplants not real uncle of mine might have been on to something. Maybe he was right to be skeptical, and maybe skeptical is a good thing to be. According to Dr Novella, he was right and I owe him an apology.Overall Score 4 / 5In a Sentence: A manual for how to understand and survive in a world suffering under the massive weight of misinformation."
59,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4437648-adrienne,5,"I received an advance copy from a Goodreads First Reads giveaway.This book was fantastic! I regularly read several science-based medicine blogs, and I've read many of Dr. Steven Novella's articles. When I heard that he was publishing a book, I knew it was a must-read. This book explains critical thinking, logical fallacies, problems with memory, biases, and other concepts to help readers learn how to examine a claim to determine its plausibility and (in)accuracy. I wish I had had a book like this when I was in high school, and I recommend it to everyone who wants to learn how to look at statements and claims with a skeptical eye to avoid being taken for a ride...or worse.The authors discussed several examples of how pseudoscience can be harmful. Sure, it's one thing to believe in Santa and ghosts or whatever, but it's entirely different when you want to apply magical thinking to other people in which it could hurt or even kill them (such as by denying appropriate and effective medical care). I found it fascinating to read the discussion about real-world examples of individuals believing things that turned out to be false, such as the Clever Hans effect.This book is great for people who might be on the fence about scientific issues, but it probably will not be popular for those who stake their identity with their beliefs or who are hard-core conspiracy theorists. I felt a little crushed reading their take-down of the Warrens and supernatural/ghostly phenomena. Regarding conspiracy theories, this book was actually reassuring in that perhaps evil is not hiding everywhere in plain sight. I tend to be conspiracy-minded, but the tools in this book can help me evaluate the information to determine its plausibility. Do conspiracies happen? Of course, and the authors recognized that. But we also need to temper paranoid thoughts with rationality and skepticism.Those who want to learn more about science and who want to learn how to discern what's real in a world where more and more things are false would appreciate this book. Christmas is coming. I think this would be an excellent gift."
60,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9525548-robert-starr,4,"I imagine this is a tough book to put together. It needs to be broad, yet complete, and detailed enough to satisfy pedantic readers. And it, above all, needs to be accurate. The SGU seems to want to have it all here, appealing to new skeptics without boring the show's long-time fans. Perhaps this was a mistake. No book can be everything, but in so much as this one tries, it achieves it.The writing is clear, though I'd be interested in hearing how believers respond. The advantage of a book like this, with wide ranging topics, is that you can see just where people's sacred cows show up (""Of course aliens are silly and so is homeopathy, but my chiropractor changed my life!"").It's possible and even likely that errors have made their way into this book and it's even more likely that science will unravel more and more about some of the topics discussed, but the core ideas — particularly the sections on logical fallacies — will likely be relevant for years to come.The skeptic label has been hijacked to some degree, over the past few years. Or maybe it hasn't, but it certainly seems to have become a cesspool of know-it-alls and misogynists, to mention nothing of the rape apologists. It's frustrating because the SGU hasn't been completely immune to this, but they're only human and, at least from what I can tell, their sins are largely those of association — giving a platform to people who help make the skeptical world toxic.This is already a long book, but it'd be nice to see the SGU take a firmer moral stance against the Michael Shermers and Lawrence Krausses out there, especially in the middle of the ""Me Too"" movement. This is probably an unfair criticism — that's not the book they were trying to write. But as leaders in the community, I think it's important to call out those who don't belong.Overall, though, this is a solid primer on skepticism and I'd recommend it to those who are new to the concept. It covers a lot of ground with both efficiency and elegance."

If you've been listening to the podcast for any amount of time, you probably won't find many surprises, but nonetheless I found it interesting as a refresher. If you've not listened to the podcast, then I imagine you'd really enjoy hearing about the weird and wacky world of logical fallacies, subconscious bias and pseudo-science.I particularly enjoyed the chapter on dealing with pseudoscience among friends and family. We've all been there.I have four criticisms:1) I didn't enjoy the opening chapter. It made me feel like I was being inducted into the cult of skepticism. As it happens, I don't like the term ""skeptic"" and wouldn't identify this way. I just like critical thinking and hearing about pseudo-science.2) I found the AI chapter very cheesy. Perhaps this is due to my line of work (I'm a computer scientist). I also don't find AI all that interesting, so I'm probably biased. I'm also a techophobe. It seems that the more you learn about how computers work, the less you trust them to make decisions about human life. I'll probably have to retract this comment at the time of the singularity...3) It would have been nice if citations had been linked inline among the prose of the book, so that I could follow up a statement into the corresponding source. E.g. ""One study [2] showed..."". The citations for the whole book are listed at the back, but there is no parity with the statements in the book.4) The book ended abruptly.All in all. A fun read, but not quite 5 stars.I hope Steve releases a 'name that logical fallacy' exercise book in the future. I'd enjoy that."

This volume does not disappoint. I figured it would take the mantle from Carl Sagan's ""Demon Haunted World"" but instead of replacement, it sits next to it on equal grounds.It's somewhat more of an encyclopedia of definitions, terms and concepts; all of which, are invaluable. And it was a bit trying to read through because of the style choice. Nevertheless, it gets five stars from me for covering all the bases and necessities of critical thinking. I shall be returning to it time and again for clarifications and adjustments to my own thinking. It is, after all, addressed to the reader. We're all in need of the information within.This book could be used at the high school level, a required reading and testing for understanding, for all students before graduation. Application of the material in this book would go a long way to fending off the con-men, pseudosciences and the like we encounter in day to day living. And learning the skills explained in this volume would do well for everyone, not just those interested in the sciences.Take the anti-vaccination people. Those people are literally going to kill some of us by allowing disease to spread because they're basing their ideas off of bad information. Or the anti-GMO crowd. These foods are saving millions from starvation as the planet's population rises. Knowledge in just these areas would save lives. The examples go on and many reviewed in this book."
63,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9129386-stephen-sakuma,5,"This book truly succeeds in the goal of being a broad thoughtful overview of skepticism. The authors explore how we (you and me and everyone else included) trick ourselves through often subtle mechanisms into believing things that may not necessarily be true. I say ""may not necessarily"" because the book nicely explores the concepts of logic and reasoning and how to use them to understand whether or not a particular argument says what the purveyor thinks it does. This doesn't mean that what they are saying isn't true, it just means that we don't know it from the information presented. Which brings forward why this book really shines. In this book the authors are focused on helping us understand how (in a world full of increasingly complex ideas that we can never hope to be true experts in) to determine what is real. Using logic and science it really is possible. Many people get lost in the weeds and never dig deep enough or thoughtfully enough to appreciate that we can answer non-value questions in objective and useful ways.On a related note, I was a little disappointed in the book until the last few chapters because I really wanted a discussion on how to use these ideas in your life and it had not come. And then it did! I was really impressed with the ending discussions regarding practical approaches to being a positive force in the world and bringing as much rationality as possible while balancing the human psychological components of resistance to new ideas and change in general."

And most importantly: ""How to know what's really real in a world increasingly full of fake"".Whatever you are doing, knowledge is crucial. The most common thing of this era of information is, as Neil deGrasse Tyson put it: ""To know enough about a subject to think you are right but not enough to know you are wrong."" This applies to everything and the Skeptics' guide shows you not only how common it is for the people around you to be wrong but gives you the challenge of putting yourself to the test. Novella and his contemporaries not only explore all the ways our brain is flawed and thinking biased but guide us in all the concepts every scientific skeptic must know. After some of the chapters there are fun conundrums to wrap your head around. And see for yourself that even with prior knowledge it's not easy to overcome your cognitive biases. You have to understand that our brains are made for survival, not rational thinking. The book covers extreme amount of information in a small volume - there is nothing unnecessary. Chapters are neither too long to take away your attention nor too short so that you won't grasp the concept. The most important thing the book gives you is a perspective of changing yourself and the world by being skeptical. How you can apply critical thinking to a specific problem in your life.I'm gladly delighted by this read and is probably the best money I've spent in a while. Thank you, Steven Novella!"

Something that I'll be coming back to over the years.---First Section---The first section of the book covers off on what are classed as 'core concepts', including neuropsychological (e.g., Ideomotor Effect or Fallibility of Perception) and metacognitive (e.g., Dunning-Kruger Effect or Cognitive Biases and Heuristics) 'effects' that someone should be aware of. There is ten chapters devoted to a general discussion on 'science and pseudoscience' (some topics covered include postmodernism, placebo effects and p-hacking). The last sub-part of the first section is ten chapters that cover off on various tales in history (including free energy, N-Rays, and pyramid schemes). What I really liked about this section is that the author makes the point that it is just not 'quacks', 'scammers', and 'idiots' (the labels are mine) that fall for scams; it can also be experienced and intelligent people, everyone needs to be wary of being effected by the core principles raised in this section. ---Section 2, 3, 4---The last four sections of the book are much smaller then the first half and covers various specific cases in detail. These include ghost hunting, fake news, false balance, and naturopathy."

The book itself fairly straightforwardly takes you through the basics of the lost art of not believing everything you read in the comments section of YouTube as well as the forgotten strategy of just telling the truth about stuff. In a world of Deepfakes and scripted and heavily edited reality television starring actors who appear on such shows for a living, the book appeals to pro'lly about however many science PhD's the U.S. still produces. However, these folks will find comfort in the knowledge oases of clarity still exist in the general sea of male enhancement pills made of recycled Chinese newspapers and celebrities with medical theories that are, literally, getting children killed. The writing sounds just like an over-excited geek finally getting a chance to get a word in edgewise amongst the caterwauling of as people who follow Stephen Colbert's technique of: ""I think it, I say it and you read it. Sometimes I don't even think it."" The style can be a little much at times and it does aim higher on the education scale but, generally speaking, the voice is clear. In short, this one light of rationality will do little to illuminate the claustrophic darkness we find ourselves in, but at least it exists and you should read it."
67,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/87324303-jonne-steen-redeker,5,"The book is truly what it is advertised as on the cover, a great guide through a world of bullshit. The first, and lengthiest part of the book is a guide in the most literal way. It gives tips on how to think critically and sceptically. Pitfalls to avoid, and a healthy dose of self reflection. It uses real world examples of course, but the main focus is on the actual thinking errors that occurred rather than the specific claims. As the book calls it it is filling our sceptical utility belts with the tools we need. After this the book goes over many examples of where this went wrong, some are tragic, some are hilarious, but the people making these mistakes are still human, and treated as such. Whether it is ghost hunters, 9/11 truthers, or even people who killed their adoptive daughter through less than scientific medical treatments, they all fell for basic thinking mistakes that we can all fall prey to. Even one of the coauthors fell for 9/11 truthers for a short time. I loved this book, having listened to all the episodes of the podcast a lot of it felt repetitive, but having a single source for all of it will be very handy indeed. I would prefer to have more stories of the sceptical adventure kind, but I understand the need to build a basis for new readers and old readers alike. So my hope is that there will be a sequel with more stories, because as any sceptic knows, the world is full of true believers and their unsinkable rubber duckies. On a sadder note, the dedication did get to me a little, so in that spirit thank you Perry, Steve, Bob, Jay, Evan & Cara, all sceptics and wonderful people ""of some note""."

The book does a walk through of common pseudosciences and logical fallacies which is fine, but again, this is not content that you won't pick up listening to their show. Additionally, this is a case where we're dealing with a world of fake news and return of populist fascism, I'm less concerned about people being into certain pseudosciences. I get that it's important to fight over facts and such, but the actual ""how to"" section is lacking. There's really no way to accelerate the long slow process of having someone build trust in you and then slowly having them realize they may be mistaken. What's even more concerning is that there is amazing advice that's been given out during the show that didn't make it into the book which almost makes me want to un-recommend the book.I got it because I was a fan. If you're familiar with the show, you don't need it. If you're not familiar with the show, listen to a few, and if you don't want to go through the back catalog but kind of like it, grab this instead.This book is likely also useful to kids or teens who may not have much a skeptical toolbox to start and it's much more inviting than Carl Sagan's The Demon-Haunted World which is much less approachable than this book.

I wanted a comprehensive compendium of skeptic / critical thinking basics yet something that would still expand my knowledge after years of following the podcast. And this book delivers 200% and is much much more that I have ever hoped for. Steven's and other rogues ease of explaining science and philosophical terms paired with geeky sense of humour (Star Wars, Star Trek, Lord of the Rings etc. references here and there) makes it an absolutely fantastic read from cover to cover. The skeptical concepts are neatly organised into well portioned chapters and help reader follow critical thinking narratives from start to practical implementation. This book should be read by EVERYONE, should be part of a standard school or college curriculum all over the world. It's a book I will keep going back to for years to keep myself in check on critical approach to the world.In Steve's own words ""This is not a f***ing self-help book"" but when applied it will change your life and world view for the better.

I gave it 5 stars because it affirmed my belief about memoirs and how accurate they are, or in most cases, are not. I quote from very early in the book, page 9 to be exact - ""But how reliable is human memory? Think of a vivid childhood remembrance, the kind of memory that you recall often and that represents an important part of your history and identity. I hate to break this to you (actually, or I don't), but that memory is probably mostly, or even entirely, fake."" Yes, our brains process information in such a way that what we think years later is how something happened could be the exact opposite of what we think happened. It is not just Facebook entries, or news pundits, or network news (although it is all of these things), but our own mental powers are sometimes powerless in extracting the truth from what we think is the truth. It can even be someone else's truth. This is a must-read book that helps us understand and work with out faulty circuits, and give reading memoirs a wide berth in actually taking their contents to heart."

First the book explores ways in which we fool ourselves and how to be wary of them, then applies the knowledge with stories from the authors (IMO a slightly boring bit). The third part is about skepticism in the media, IMO one of the most interesting to understand how longer than expected the path a piece of information has to travel before being consumed, and how incentives along the way can distort the message that is ultimately delivered (I find this important because for many people this is a reason to “distrust” science in its “ever changing findings”). Part 4 includes cautionary tales on the danger of pseudoscience and how such beliefs are far from harmless (as some proponents want people to believe). The last part brings everything home, giving a summary on how to apply the skills learned on the journey to ourselves, and on how to communicate with others around controversial topics. Highly recommended. "

One time I had a heated discussion with a colleague who claimed that she considered herself a prophet and she wanted her students to ""convert"" to feminism. I argued that I did not want conversion. I wanted to teach my students the critical thinking skills to analyze the sources and effects of sexism, racism and other forms of oppression so that they could make their own assessments and conclusions. This book presents the tools for critical and scientific thinking and problem-solving. I appreciated the authors' simple (not simplistic) and clear descriptions (except for the section on probability which I've always had trouble with) and analysis of how to approach questions and new information. I didn't always agree with everything they said but I learned quite a bit about scientific methods and how the brain functions to help enlighten or delude us.

I found myself more engrossed in this book than the fiction I've been reading recently, which is a high bar that non-fiction usually cannot get over.Everyone should be familiar with the concepts in this book, so everyone should read it. If you're not currently a skeptic, or you find some of the positions of skeptics problematic you still should be familiar with what skepticism is, so you can fairly evaluate it. This book teaches a lot about the process of thinking, and how it can go wrong, so it's useful for everyone, beyond just individual issues that people normally get hyper focused on. Similarly to the idea that if you learn to learn you'll be better than off than if you learn to memorize specific information, if you learn to think, you'll be better off than if you settle into you positions on various individual topics.Read it."

I was about 20 pages in and was already thinking, ""Holy crap, how to humans function AT ALL?!"" But it was fascinating to learn about all of the different ways humans use mental short cuts and irrational thinking to function. Then the book gets into pseudoscience and the various ways that have cropped up over the years and continue in various forms, plus some personal experiences dealing with pseudoscience.

Because of that you need to use a ton of logical tools to help yourself see through all the ways that you are likely to be wrong, whether it be through wishful thinking, logical fallacies, anecdotes or other things.This book is an excellent starting point to understand how skepticism works and why it is so important. It takes you through all the major sources of misconceptions, biases and other things that are constantly trying to mislead you.The book is entertaining, at times easy to read, but when necessary it does not hesitate to get into the finer details. If you are new to skepticism you may need to read these parts more than once to fully grasp them, and in that respect it also works as a encyclopedia that you'll want to return to again and again."

I gave this 4 stars due to the preachy tone in the chapter about GMO’s, the last several chapters of the book being kind of “meh” (in my opinion), and the brief part where the author comes across as an apologist for one of Hilary Clinton’s many big fat tall tales.

Novella ascribes to scientific skepticism, so science is the measure of all things for him. I find this problematic because, as even Novella admits, it's difficult to distinguish legitimate science from pseudoscience. He has a long chapter on logical fallacies, but commits many himself, particularly appeal to authority. He makes a lot of ""science says"", ""studies show"", and ""the consensus of scientists is"" style statements throughout the book. Science, or more accurately the scientific method, is a process of continual discovery. It is dynamic, not static, and anyone claiming that the “science is established” is unscientific. Novella agrees and says this throughout the book, but it feels like he’s just paying lip service as his faith in science far outweighs his skepticism of it. However, he concludes the book by telling us not to trust him, which is the best advice a skeptic can give. "

How to think, not what to think.It's going to be scoffed at by overly religious folks, or those that peddle in woo, but that really is showing it's points in real-life, that those that simply believe what they are told without strong evidence or significantly statistical relevance to any argument should not be relied upon, for anything, let alone important life decisions. It's probably not going to change climate science deniers, anti-vaxers, or young earth intelligent designers minds.

It was not as ""anti-religious"" as I thought it might be - the author seems to have a particular interest in exposing homeopathy, but never really addresses ""faith healing"" - and is careful to leave most matters of spirituality out, other than to explain that by definition spiritual beliefs should not and cannot be substituted for scientific reasoning.

The book shines relatable themes of evidence-based light on how our brains work and how those workings inevitably connect with the psychological, philosophical, socio-political, and so-many-other underpinnings of how we structure and interact with the world.

The fact that the author pointed out things to look for and be aware of was also enlightening.

This was a great introduction to skepticism. One tiny critique would be the chapter on logical fallacies, namely that it was a chapter with lots of concepts mushed together and no chance to practice them. Identifying logical fallacies is crucial to the kind of thinking discussed in this book, so it's a shame we didn't get a more in-depth look or at least a few practice exercises.

They even address this in the closing interviews on the audiobook, purposefully rewrote some of it to sound like it was all Novella's work. Um, no, you missed a couple spots, and so badly that it was actively confusing to me."
92,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15308689-nick-edkins,5,"An excellent resource. Having listened to the podcast for more than ten years, I've heard all of these points before, but having it all collected, organised, and focused means the message hits much harder. What I found most helpful were the frequent reminders that all of the methods of self-deception apply just as strongly to all of us. The idea of learning all the logical fallacies so that you can make someone look stupid and win an argument is not appealing to me, but interrogating my own thinking and catching myself taking shortcuts is. The takeaway is not a feeling of superiority but of humility."
93,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22576651-kevin,4,"The SGU is a nicely written and information-packed introduction to the topics typically talked about in skeptic circles. With about 470 pages of information and references, it is quite hefty, but it's broken down into digestible chapters (the perfect guide to frequent bathroom breaks caused by indigestion). The last chapter, Being Skeptical, is the most important and is handled in a serious yet heartfelt manner. We are all susceptible to mistakes in our thinking and arguments, and we should take time to make the concerted effort of remembering our own mistakes while pointing out those made by others."
94,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24746698-elisa,4,"Interesting. I didn't like some of the points the authors make, but I have no choice but to reflect upon them. Some of the concepts that they mention are not new (Predictably Irrational by Steve Ariely had already educated me on some of the topics) even if the examples are original. They don't really get into the existence of God (simply not scientific), which is good. They made me mad sometimes (something they think is good) and shocked me into seeing positions that I don't agree with (even if, mostly, I hold the same opinions on many of the concepts). Has it changed my mind on my previous opinions? No. Do I want to send this to my Dad to convince him that man has gone to the Moon? Yes."

It is a must-have book if you want to get into the nitty-gritty of skeptical topics such as the fallibility of the human mind, biases, pseudoscience, and science. While you may not be interested in each and every chapter, it is meant to be more of a reference book that leaves nothing out, so this was going to be the case. Useful book to share with family and friends who want to understand as well! I found it really useful to reinforce many subjects which i had been learning about from the Skeptics Guide podcast. Looks great on my shelf next to Cosmos."

Highly recommended for anyone interested in understanding the logic behind pseudoscience and its purveyors, and how their logical fallacies are a part of us all. The book was more a Logic Log, as intended, than an engaging read, and I found myself wanting more details for many of the examples. But the book would have been ridiculously long, so its current size is a reasonable accommodation. Well worth the time and price - and nice to be able to read it in bits and pieces as I await the next SGU podcast drop!"

The world would be a much better place if everyone read it and truly made an effort to question why they believe what they do. It is full of excellent and compelling stories of the harm magical belief and pseudoscience cause and models the skills a skeptical thinker needs - not least of which is questioning ones own beliefs and being willing to change an opinion based on new evidence."

I'll admit the first 250 pages are a little dry but the information is good and I found the last 200 pages or so fascinating. This book makes many good points, it's more of an outline of pop culture issue science faces today. I don't think this book will change anyone's mind I think it's geared more to people who agree with these ideas, being someone who does I found this book very enlightening. I gave me a few things to think about especially in the way I will approach science denialist in the future."

The bulk of the book is about concepts and how to think: confirmation bias, logical fallacies, the availability heuristic, and so on. The section about specific adventures in skepticism is shorter, but fun--nothing new. It's a good read for sharpening up your thinking, though occasionally it could do with acknowledging some of science's weaknesses--not so much the concept of scientific investigation, but the limits of our scientific knowledge.

Steven Novella discusses not just basic logical fallacies we as humans often use (and fall for), but also how our brains work, and how our memories might not be what they seem, and why this allows us to hold irrational or nonsensical beliefs.This book should be mandatory for everyone. Critical thinking skills are sorely lacking in a world that follows ""fake news"" more than ever."

If this book was required course material for every high schooler, we would likely live in a more sane and credible world instead of the abundance of fake news and other flimsy reporting we are forced to put up with. Just a fantastic and incredibly important read. Highly suggested material here. "

I did pick up some good tidbits, but I must say the podcast is always better than the book. The title really should be: Where the Logic Fails in the Most Popular Myths. I wish it was more like Thinking Fast and Slow in that they don't require a prerequisite of believing in evolution and the Big Bang to buy into the narrative.

I found it very useful. It's almost like a reference in some sense. Reading it straight through is definitely good, but I imagine I'll look through it quite a few more times here and there. It's a great introduction to critical thinking. "

Very easy to read and not overly clinical (if at all).

106,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/77220592-mario-shebib,4,"A very long but enjoyable book, for most it's probably best to read sort of as a reference book rather than from start to end, though it works well even with that. Goes over the topic of scientific skepticism and critical thinking in great detail and was a very interesting book to read as someone who has relatively recently been introduced to the podcast. It might have been a bit nice if there was a demarcation of the different hosts, since without there being outside of the adventures in Skepticism it made me feel as though it was mostly Steven Novella writing it."

Steven Novella takes us on a journey across the human psyche and debunks common tropes, popular conspiracies, personal biases, and the “pseudoscientific method”. Novella does a fantastic job in presenting the logical fallacies we too often commit because of our incorrect memories, personal beliefs, and experiences. What is important is being aware of those biases and open to continuously question all information."

This would be a great coffee table book as you could flip through and refer back to small sections if you wanted. It was nice to consume in small bite-sized chunks, but it wasn't something I was itching to listen to more. The information is solid with entertaining and useful examples. Overall, it was a good review of a lot of cognitive biases that we have and I found myself remembering times I've used these types of arguments in conversations (and when they were used on me). It was a good reminder to provide more thoughtful arguments when debating other people."

It is an interesting read but I would have loved the book to be written in a way so that it would hook me a bit more. Now I liked the info but I did feel like it could have been written in a more ”exciting” way. I am looking forward to the next book from Steve and the gang.

On the other hand you can't take away the amount of work that has gone into it. Steven, you have my greatest respect and thank you for discussing Blacklight Power when I wrote in to query it."

Especially by the chapters on the harm that is caused by magical thinking, and the encouragement and call to action for skeptics. I really liked the example chapter of bad science journalism. ""Thinking for yourself is an endless freak show.""What I learned: Iridology started with an observation of an injured owl. ""Mana"" is a Polynesian word for the animating force.

260,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1720603-baal-of,5,"I would find it difficult if not impossible to find a better book for explaining the core principles of skepticism, with an emphasis on the process, not the conclusions. This is the kind of book I wish everyone would read, absorb, and apply. Novella, et al. make the point multiple times that these principles can be applied to claims of other people, but that the more importantly one should apply them to one's own arguments first and foremost. These are tools to improve your own thinking. the world would be a better place if more people understood neuropsychological humility, the principle of charity, and how much everyone is subject to confirmation bias. The book is written in clear, easy to read prose with a minimum of jargon. I will be buying more copies to give away."
261,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/109739055-miaou,4,"4/5 stars means I really liked this book and would strongly recommend it.This books deals with scientific skepticism; a subject which has very little recognition among society at large, but which I consider extremely important.The author ventures to build a well-organised overview of the subject, and I think he succeeds at it to a good degree. Having said that, I would very much like for the book to be even more rigorous, more detailed and better cited. In short, I would like it to be a bit more on the rigorous/academic side and less on the simplified/""popularised""/dumbed-down side.One thing I would consider a minor flaw is that objective fact and the authors' opinion is not always 100% clear (thus why I would want for the book to be better cited). The clearest example of this is the short discussion on the hard problem of consciousness, where the author presents Dennett's view as the obvious solution to the problem when most thinkers and scientists working in this field disagree with it.Lastly, the first few chapters of the book are really not that well-written (I tried reading the book twice and twice I quit at the very beginning because I found it very uninteresting) but once you are past page 40 or so it becomes much easier to read. It's really worth muscling your way though those first pages because the information on this book is really important.I think that this book nicely complements Kahneman's ""Thinking Fast and Slow"", offering additional tools to improve one's thinking process."

At least, pessimism was ranked higher that positive thinking, although I always considered pessimism to be realistic thinking. Guess what? The future is hard to predict.  Perhaps, the bottom line is that many people/groups believe many things perhaps because they can or perhaps because that is what they taught. Or, perhaps the things are in their best fiscal interest. There are plenty of words in this volume. A lot of ink was killed to print this book.  Maybe the message is: don’t believe nothing until you have checked it out.... and, then, check it out again. Or maybe it has something to do with too many anecdotes. If it is not one goofiness, it is another- to paraphrase my mother. Finally, after all the anecdotes, chapter 56 (Being Skeptical) gets down to business. So, do not give up before at least reading these few pages.  Critical thinking is part of being real. Most people are not real. Perhaps, they should read this book."

It takes something like science to understand the truth, but it’s up against a range of bias and glitches already in our thinking. These include glitches such as cognitive biases (searching and noticing only evidence that supports the beliefs you’ve already formed) and the Dunning–Kruger effect whereby people believe they are better than others but actually lack so much self-awareness to don’t realise how little they truly know. Think Trump perhaps. This book explains so much of magical thinking, the type where intelligent people can be just as foolish and ignorant in their thinking as anyone else because what is sometimes more important is the ability to use critical thinking as opposed to magical thinking. This book beautifully demonstrates our biases and glitches in our thinking including memory (memory can be easily distorted) and how we delude ourselves. This is an excellent book for helping you to become more aware and to overcome all your biases and to look at more appropriate ways of thinking, Particularly through the use of science. Fools and fanatics are certain of everything but to be wise in your thinking means you have to question everything, keep an open mind, be humble, uncertain and be doubtful, and question what you think you already know. This book will help you. I have read quite a bit on the subject so not all of this was new to me, but I’m sure it will be new to many. "

Lucky for me I am a natural skeptic and do not often accept things at face value. For the more gullible individuals out there I would definitely recommend The Skeptics Guide to the Universe. Even for those people whom need multiple layers of evidence before they are convinced something is fact, it is a fun read.The skill of thinking critically and understanding what is real and what is not is becoming so important with the power of social media. Society is being flooded with falsehoods at such a fast rate because digital content reaches the masses like never before in our history. How can expect to spot all the fake stories on Twitter or Facebook if we cannot think critically? The purveyors of these falsehoods are relying on the fact that most people will not be able to pick out the truth. Books like The Skeptics Guide can train people to recognize the plentiful lies out there.The book is in no way a bore and the author, Dr. Steven Novella, keeps a nice flow with short chapters and providing real life examples for each of his skepticism techniques. If you are not normally an academic reader, but are looking for something in the realm of science that has practical applications then this could be the book for you. Don’t be a patsy and fall for the lies, pseudoscience, or fraud the world (or our own government) throws at you. Think about it critically and use the steps Dr. Novella provides to be better. No one wants to be a sheep so stand up, read this book, and lead the heard. "

I've been a fan of the eponymous podcast for years, and Novella does a good job of distilling the themes that are scattered throughout the hundreds of episodes and his blog. Highly recommended, either for long-time fans of the podcast and veterans of skepticism or for those exploring either for the first time."
268,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91934379-robert-d,5,"Just as the title suggests, this is the perfect book for people who require some level of science-based, verifiable evidence before believing or promoting an idea. This is especially important in the age of the internet where numerous baseless theories are promoted on a daily basis. The book takes a deep-dive into the topics such as: science vs pseudoscience; conspiracy theories and why people love them; placebo effects; cherry-picking data; ""moving the goalposts""; confirmation bias; and why science doesn't deal with faith-based issues, since science only deals with things that can be (at least hypothetically) disproved. Though there are a couple of chapters that get a bit dense, most of the chapters are quite easy to read and to grasp the main points of. What you realize by reading the book is that being called a skeptic is actually a badge of honor. We've seen what can result from hysterical thinking derived from theories that lacked of solid evidence; whether it be from the anti-vaxxers, to climate-change ignorers, to the witch-hunt trials in the 17th Century. The skeptic is the person who demands strong evidence and believes that a sound scientific model and expert consensus is the best way to separate fact from fiction."

I recognize most of the topics discussed in the book, some have been discussed many times on the show.Still I enjoyed the book very much and read it rather quickly. Of course you don't have to be a seasoned skeptic to enjoy the book. I even envy readers wo read about this stuff for the first time. You should be aware that this is not just one of those self-help books that gives you simple recipes.This book really covers a lot of topics, it's astounding how many aspects skepticism has. Some chapters I want to praise especially are those about the workings of science, what shortages it has, especially when it comes to communicating the results. And the problems with science journalism. I simply cannot give it less than 5/5"
270,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21737127-valerie,4,"🌈 As a fan of the podcast I can say that this is an entertaining and important book as both a companion and standalone work. I think there's a perception that science and skepticism don't really promote quality of life because they do not encourage happiness, connection, or introspection. This book as well as the ""Skeptic's Guide to the Universe"" podcast challenge that. The pursuit of objectivity and truth is profound in part because it is deeply moral. It is humble, unselfish, and honest. We cannot accept something as real simply because it suits a certain aesthetic or worldview or because we want it to be true. A belief that affects how we treat people (and I mean this medically and interpersonally) must be based upon honesty and evidence. Science is the elegant and essential process by which we gather that evidence."

It has proven to be the end of the way I used to view the world.Hard to describe how much of a burden has been lifted off my shoulders by relearning concepts that I had been taught once before but with baggage attached.This quote pretty much sums it up for me:“Skepticism is also fun and empowering. One of the most common bits of feedback we get from listeners is that they’ve finally shed a belief system, and how liberating it is. They don’t have to labor under an oppressive belief anymore. They can think freely and only believe what actually makes sense to them.”"

There’s some good info presented but it is hidden in the repetition, political/belief bias, and contradicting ideas (ie. not practicing what you preach). There are a lot of “facts” presented without sources. He also chooses general arguments that exist in society and uses the most radical beliefs on the spectrum to breakdown. There is skepticism for the sake of truth (and sanity) and there is skepticism for the sake of pulling others down with the ship of misery. This book walks the fine line between them."

Really made me look at the individual who believed in these conspiracies as more of a victim than anything else & taught me how to think critically about information. Though I will still be holding onto my belief that there is life outside our solar system."

Good to put in check any information. I loved also the tone, more if you are a fan of their podcast. As a practical guide to understand your own limitations, how to review any opinion you have and a list of dangerous pseudoscience beliefs. You can read in one go, and also as a reference of logical fallacies and more. "

Unlike a lot of books written by skeptics, you will come away from this knowing both the skeptic argument and the believer's argument very well. Most importantly, the book will force you to take a good long look at your own presuppositions and reasoning. Well worth the time spent."
276,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42312931-mark-kind,5,A nice concise collection of many of the more important concepts regularly covered in the podcast. I'm handing it off to my girlfriend to read so she doesn't have to listen to over 600 episodes to get caught up.

283,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43378179-aria,5,"---- Disclosure: I received this book for free from Goodreads. ----  As someone w/ a degree in the hard sciences, I was not unfamiliar w/ the concepts & a fair bit of the material discussed in this book, but still found it to be quite a good read. It was a solid reminder of why vigilance in the scientific method & peer review process is so crucial. For non-scientist types, there will obviously be a lot in here to take under consideration. It would be a good overall primer to the very broad field of what ""science"" is, as well as what it most certainly is not.     There is a chunk near the front bit of the book that goes into a needed review of concepts like logical fallacies, & poor &/or specious arguments. This bit, quite honestly, can be a little tedious, but hang in there. It is necessary ground for dissecting what are good & proper statements of plausibility, & what stuff is just misleading crap, intentional or otherwise. Even outside the world of science, the knowledge of such things is invaluable. (Try practicing the evaluation of political statements & comments according to these concepts. It'll do your head in.)   I love that the book was a collaboration, with different people taking on different topics. They know of what they speak, & it shows. My only moment of confusion came w/ the Wason Selection Task, so I went online to seek out other sources. I found an explanation that was more preferable to me at http://skepdic.com/refuge/ctlessons/l... , but honestly it only made sense after I further read the current page at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wason_s... (I know, it's Wikipedia, but replacing the letter options with colors really helped my brain sort the information better.) I look forward to listening to the show sometime, as I knew nothing about it prior to this book. It sounds like it's my kind of thing. I also had a ton of fun over at http://www.tylervigen.com/spurious-co... , so thanks for bringing that into my life. Mostly though, I feel relieved to know there are real-life unrecognized superheroes such as these authors out there in the world. Every day they're out there somewhere, doing their good works, just because that's what they do. Seriously, that kind of thing is so under-valued, but ripples out into the world in ways that can not be measured.  I will surely recommend this book to others....well, to everyone, really. They'll have to get their own copies, though. I'm keeping mine so I can refer to the aforementioned section on various false arguments & unsound premises. I can usually recognize such things, but I have a hard time remembering exactly which b.s./problem elements are related to which kind of erroneous of statements or thought processes, if that makes any sense. Regardless, I'm keeping the book on my shelf, so thanks!  P.S.: The section on GMO's I had trepidation about entering, but you handled it like a champ. Very well done, indeed. "
