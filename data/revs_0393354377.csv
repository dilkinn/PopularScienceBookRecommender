The Chicken gun has a sixty foot barrel, putting it solidly in the class of an artillery piece. While a four pound chicken hurtling in excess of 400 miles per hour is a lethal projectile…
OK, stop right there. Mary Roach’s latest venture into odd science begins with a notion that would likely raise the hackles and maybe the hopes of Rocky the Rhode Island Red of the film  Chicken Run. Yikes!But Rocky would be better off sticking with the usual modes of transportation for the aeronautically challenged. These are no Iron Man chickens. The poultry the Army is using for its much-enlarged version of birdshot have already been relieved of their pluck, among other things. They are standing in for the many avian perils that endanger military pilots, and have been aimed at test planes. Roach does not report whether the cannon issued a squawk along with the boom when it let the feathers fly. This is what happens when you turn Mary Roach, author of such gleeful romps as Bonk (a long, hard look at sex), Stiff (yes, dealing with late residents, and nothing to do with that other book), Spook (looking into where they might have gone), Packing for Mars (the joys and bodily fluids of space travel), and Gulp (a journey through the alimentary canal even  Captain Willard  may have taken a pass on), loose on the US military. She is not interested in the best ways to harm the enemy, but in the collateral science that accompanies the military’s deadly missions. Things like dealing with noise, heat, sharks, submarine rescue, keeping coyotes away from the field test cadavers, the joys of flies and maggots, and then it gets back to familiar MR turf, keeping up with the latest science on letting go. Roach spends a lot of time at a military test location, Camp Lemonnier. I picture it being devoured by swarms of tiny, chainsaw-toothed Liz Lemons.First, the more serious. Safety in vehicles, a favorite target for IEDs, is a major concern for the military. Roach looks at vehicles designed to minimize potential blast damage, not just to the vehicle but to its occupants. She checks out TCAPS, (Tactical Communication and Protective System) an advanced audio communications tool used primarily by Special Forces. It amplifies quiet sound and dampens loud noise. She provides a look at progress in reconstructing, even transplanting, sex organs damaged or lost by gunfire or explosives. She works up a sweat explaining perspiration. 
 Until this trip, I thought of sweat as a sort of self-generated dip in the lake. But sweat isn’t cool. It’s warm as blood. It essentially is blood. Sweat comes from plasma, the watery, colorless portion of blood. (A dip in the lake cools by conduction: contact with something colder. Highly effective but not always practical.) Sweat cools by evaporation: offloading your heat into the air. Like this: when you start to overheat, vessels in your skin dilate, encouraging blood to migrate there. From the capillaries of the skin, the hot plasma is offloaded through sweat glands—2.4 million or so—onto the surface of the body to evaporate. Evaporation carries heat away from the body, in the form of water vapor.
I envision sweat vampires lurking in locker rooms. Roach explains how heat illness works. It ain’t pretty. Blast Boxers are examined, although not while…you know, they are in use. Body armor too. Turns out you would need so many layers of protection to fend off IEDs that you would be too weighted down to walk. Flame resistance in fabric is considered as well as the temperature at which human flesh burns. You will learn where the term “bite the bullet” came from and what it was really intended to accomplish. Also considered are the relative benefits of going shirtless vs shirted on a hot day, the uses of kitty litter in theater, and why the military is so insistent on personnel being clean-shaven. You will learn about the uses and hazards of filth flies and, yes, maggots. “Maggot!” as a drill sergeant (or wifely) form of address may sting a bit less after you gain a new respect for little white squigglers in these pages.Thanks, Sarge - USMC photo by Sgt. Reece LodderAircraft design does not stop at maximizing lift, and getting the most speed and endurance per unit of fuel. There are more human concerns that need to be addressed, particularly when the shit hits the …everything.
 On a long sortie out of Diego Garcia island, the only crew member capable of operating the plane’s defensive equipment abruptly left his post to use the chemical toilet—while flying over Taliban-controlled Afghanistan. On the return flight, a faulty seal combined with the pressure differential between the toilets tiered chambers causing the contents to spew into the crew cabin. “Be assured,” he deadpanned, “this blue-brown precipitation affected the navigator’s ability to concentrate on his duties.” 
It would probably have been simpler had the affected crew member been the bombardier. But one must respect it when latrine humor hooks up with an actual latrine. Despite the humorous aspect, the military has to cope with thousands of personnel in foreign places, and the response to the new locale can often be gastrointestinal. What if, say, Seal Team Six, were en route to take out Osama Bin Laden and was thwarted because one or more of the seals had sprung a leak. Zero Dark Dirty? This is what Roach does, entertains us with the silliness aspect, the gross aspect, while also communicating important factual material. I guess this might be seen as a sort of Mary Poppins-ish spoon-full-of-sugar (or something) technique, using gross humor to teach us all something we didn’t know, although her evident glee at the scatological might make Roach more of a Mary Poopins.Mary Roach - from electronpencil.com – probably the face she has on when she writes There is much more in the book. As one has come to expect in Roach’s writing a lot of it is downright hilarious. While stopping short of staring at goats, one of the perhaps less legendary escapades of international conflict Roach sniffed out occurred when WWII allies wanted to make life miserable for Japanese officers, and so developed a particularly pungent substance that Chinese resistance fighters could surreptitiously spray on the invaders, causing them, it was expected, extreme social shame. The super secret code name for this project was…wait for it…”Who, Me?” “Million dollar Nose” man Ernest Crocker, of the chemical engineering company Arthur D. Little, was charged with developing the unlovely scent.
 Samples were prepared and delivered to the NRDC [National Research Defense Committee] in two formats: a more intense “paste-form stink,” for smearing, and a liquid stink in a squirtable two ounce lead tube. Crocker assured his clients that the latter would render a target “highly objectionable for not less than two hours at 70 F.” He promised nothing short of “complete ostracism,” concluding his report with a tagline surely unique in the annals of marketing: “as lastingly disagreeable as a product of this kind can be.”
People react very differently to the same scent. A project looking for a universally repulsive fragrance concluded that the closest they could find was the “US Government Standard Bathroom Malodor.” Nothing is universal, though. One hardy soul found it to be a “wearable” scent, which makes one wonder just how challenging it must be to settle in for a number two in his loo.
 None of [researcher Pam] Dalton’s other bottled vilenesses approached a workable criterion of universality. Sewage Odor was no good at all. Fourteen percent of Hispanic subjects described it as an odor that would make them feel good. Around 20 percent of Caucasians, Asians, and black South Africans thought it smelled edible. Vomit Odor made a similarly poor showing, with 27 percent of Xhosa subjects describing it as a feel-good smell and 3 percent of Caucasians being willing to wear it as a scent.
Which explains a lot about the olfactory ambience inside the rush hour F train. This book includes sage advice on the inadvisability of drinking one’s own urine. Thanks, but I think I’ll have the iced tea instead. This is presumably not intended for those involved in extreme water sports, but they would probably profit from the information as well. With Grunt, Mary Roach has yet again succeeded in teaching us a lot of things we never suspected, and has done so while leaving us weak from laughter. Here’s another. She also explains why we toss and turn at night in the normal course of events. And yes, we mean those who are sleeping. Sheesh! And one more. She tells us about a product that is literally called “Liquid Ass.” Don’t ask. Don’t smell. If you tell Mary Roach you think her book stinks, it would probably make her day.I suppose one must at least try to come up with items that are less than exemplary, or that, for one reason or another, do not sit well. Tough to do with Mary Roach books. The only thing, aside from the item noted in the following paragraph, is that the chapters are a bit uneven in their humor content. This is not at all a criticism, but merely observation. It is one thing to get giddy about the pursuit of an olfactory 9th ring of hell or projectile poultry, but when dealing with burn victims and the loss of life and limb that results from IEDs and taking enemy fire, levity does not come so easily. Roach has tempered her approach to tilt away from humor when a more respectful tone is called for. Thus, some chapters will leave you howling, while others will inform your brain without going too close to your funny bone. I came across only one item in the book that did not pass the smell test. There is a reference to General Dynamics, manufacturer of the IAV (Interim Armored Vehicle) Stryker, in which it is stated that GD owns Chevrolet. General Motors might be alarmed to learn that. Of course the volume I read is an ARE, and one presumes that either a correction is imminent, or GD and GM can be persuaded to arrange a quick deal. Grunt has the deeply satisfying aroma of a truly illuminating book about some very real, down and dirty issues that confront not just our military, but our species. Roach offers some history on how these challenges have been approached in the past, and fills us in on what is happening now. Many of the problems she describes have significant implications for civilian life as well. The subtitle of Roach’s book is The Curious Science of Humans at War. But it is Mary Roach’s curiosity that is the real jewel here. She always finds fascinating subjects to investigate, and Grunt is no exception. Enjoy and share her merriment at the mess of our reality. It wraps a warm cover around the laser-like intelligence she brings to bear on her chosen material. In the land of popular science writing, Roach is no grunt, but a five star general.

1,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1237196-petra-x,3,"I don't see why so many people are raving over this book. It's a disjointed series of essays giving the research and state of play of various military concerns. All written, as Mary Roach does, in a very populist way with self-deprecating humour inserted so that we know she's just like one of us and not that bright or deep or out of our league (which she probably is. Mine certainly). There isn't the depth I would like in such a serious and interesting subject except (of course) about shit. In this case diarrhoea and it's main vector, the filth fly. Mary reallyloves guts and their contents in every book she can fit them into.The subjects covered that I knew about from other books and documentaries are, sleep deprivation and decompression sickness aka 'the bends'. Subjects I didn't know anything much about and still feel I don't are materials and design of military uniforms and substituting automatic reactions for desired ones on a battlefield. Subjects that there was far too much information on were how to return sexual function to those who unfortunately lost all or most of their dicks. Roach reduced sex to function and satisfaction. That was all a bit squirmy and wince-making. I can see why, after the initial period of support and healing, the marriages break up, it all gets too technical and not enough about love-making. Sad that. I wrote this below whilst reading the book and am now reading a book on How We'll Live on Mars and kitty lit stuff features in that too. Coincidence or... trending!Too much diarrhoea. The US army in Iraq was requesting industrial quantities of kitty lit. Turns out it is the best thing to absorb runny poo and associated overwhelming stink when stuck in a hole performing surveillance on those who might go in for planting an IED or two."
2,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3675162-j-l-sutton,3,"Roach has been receiving rave reviews for popularizing (what has been called morbid or gross) science for the last number of years. I had her book Stiff: The Curious Lives of Human Cadavers on my TBR list when Grunt: The Curious Science of Humans at War became one of Audible’s Daily Deals. I immediately downloaded Grunt and began listening. I’m not sure how I would have reacted to Roach’s other books, but this one didn’t do it for me. For one, her approach to the subject seemed haphazard. Besides feeling disjointed, there was sometimes not enough depth and sometimes excruciatingly more detail than was needed. Roach picked an interesting subject so I could have handled that part. It was really the tone that gave me pause. Roach’s banter with experts seemed YA, at times snarky and at other times almost flirty (at least that’s the way it came across to me). I expect that in YA, but not in nonfiction. Unfortunately, I found the approach distracting. "
3,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19307044-brett-shavers,5,"Having served in the Marines (the entire time in an infantry battalion no less), reading about military gear and health research had me chuckling more than a dozen times, only because of having spent many nights in the rain, or the snow, or a desert, or a jungle, dealing with crap gear, tasteless food, and health risks. Although much of the book is lighthearted, such as when talking about pooping in the field, the subjects are really life and death serious, which is probably why military members joke about these sorts of topics. How else can anyone deal with it other than laughing about it?One paragraph in the book clearly stood out; a Marine amputee said that his worst injury was hearing loss, because ""he couldn't communicate with his wife and kids."" I do not think non-military can ever fully appreciate the risks involved in merely serving in the military, let alone combat. Hollywood does no justice either with blockbuster movies never showing the military combat soldier having to deal with less-than-perfect gear, unsanitary conditions for days, or pushing through illness or injury to accomplish a mission. It is good to read something that brings to light the people behind the military soldier (or Marine, or Airman, or Sailor..) working hard to make the soldier’s job a bit more bearable.Kudos to Mary Roach for talking about subjects that most citizens tend to avoid talking about, things like having diarrhea in battle…"
4,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25353295-carmen,5,"Someone else yells, ""Blood sweeps!"" A corpsman trainee reaches under my back and slides both hands from shoulders to hips. He looks at his hands, checking for blood, for a wound that might have been overlooked. If you don't happen to be wounded, blood sweeps feel lovely.Mary Roach. What can I say. One of the most entertaining non-fiction writers in existence. I always, always look forward to her books and they never disappoint. She's smart, funny, and compassionate: Ed Rachles is fucking lucky and he should be very, very thankful.Driving back from lunch, Josh and Dan sit in the back, planning their workout. I hear Dan say, ""one hundred snatches,"" which hits my ear like a Dr. Seuss title.This book is Mary Roach exploring military science. But she is not interested in guns or bombs or destruction. Instead, she explores the nitty gritty details of uncomfortable life as a deployed person. Diarrhea, heat, maggots, and hearing loss are some of the topics covered here.Until this trip, I thought of sweat as a sort of self-generated dip in the lake. But sweat isn't cool. It's warm as blood. It essentially IS blood. (A dip in the lake cools by conduction: contact with something colder. Highly effective but not always practical.) Sweat cools by evaporation: offloading your heat into the air. Like this: When you start to overheat, vessels in your skin dilate, encouraging blood to migrate there. From the capillaries of the skin, the hot plasma is offloaded through sweat glands - 2.4 million or so - onto the surface of the body to evaporate. Evaporation carries heat away from the body, in the form of water vapor. Yes, the book isn't for everyone. Roach is infamous for pressing forward where most people would shy away. Cadavers, rot, maggots, diarrhea - nothing seems to turn her off. The hardest chapters for me to read were the two chapters on genital mutilation - males only, of course. As the book mentions, if a female soldier gets close enough to an IED to wreck her genitals - she's dead. I will not say something cliched like: ""These chapters might be difficult for men to read"" because I was wincing and cringing through the whole thing and I'm female. Jezior narrates with simple anatomical vocabulary, but I can't always parse what I'm seeing in a way that matches the words. I can't even see PERSON in some of these images. I see BUTCHER SHOP. Bandages protect the psyche, too; some of these soldiers never saw what I'm seeing. Jezior had a patient who didn't see the injuries to his penis for three weeks. He clicks ahead to a slide from this man's arrival at the hospital, a close-up of the weapon-target interaction, as they say in ballistics circles. How do you prepare a patient like this for the unveiling? ""We used to try to sound optimistic,"" Jezior says. ""But when this guy finally saw it, he was like, 'Oh, my God.' It was another devastation, a second loss."" Now, they're blunter. ""I'll say, 'It's a severe injury. You'll have to see it.'"" If there's going to be a surprise, let it be a positive one.""It was especially interesting to learn how much transgender sex operations have increased the ease and safety of rebuilding soldier's blown-off testicles and penii.The great thing about Mary Roach is that she's so funny and charming. There are few situations she can't bring humor to. She is hilarious - it's very hard to get me to laugh out loud while reading a book, and I was laughing multiple times while reading this one. She is FUNNY. Here is a part where she discusses being on a ridealong during a military training exercise....but it's possible that the transcript of this mission would be somewhat irregular.""Approaching village, over.""""Copy, Liberty. Any update from the target site?""""You need to put some sunscreen on the back of your neck.""""This is Hammer in the overhead. We have four military-age males who appear to be orienting themselves to the objective area.""""Copy that, Hammer.""""So do the Taliban use hearing protection?""""This is Hammer. We've got an exodus of women and children from the village. Two other military-age males messing with something under a tarp.""""Start surging assets.""""Halo, you are approved for rockets and guns, over.""""All those holes in the ground - are they from mortars, or like - """"Prepare to attack!"""" - gophers?""""Attack imminent!""She talks about serious subjects and stares disgusting and traumatizing things in the face, but even in the middle of talking about something fascinating and gross, she will come up with a fun fact or an anecdote that will have me in stitches.It is easy to get lost on the way to the Strategic Operations bathroom, and very entertaining. You might pass a rack of freshly painted excretory systems hanging in the sun to dry, or a man seated at a workbench, trimming the seams of a molded silicone Cut Suit penis. You might overhear a person say to another person, ""If you use different blood, it voids the warranty."" At one point I take a wrong turn and find myself in a storage area. A filing cabinet drawer is labeled ""Spleens."" ""Aortas,"" another says. On top of the cabinet, Cut Suit skins are folded like blankets. When I finally find the bathroom, the sign on the door, which uses the military slang ""HEAD,"" confuses me in a way it would ordinarily not have.I always suggest Mary Roach to people who inform me, ""I don't read non-fiction."" It's kind of a gateway drug. If military science isn't your jam, she's written books on many other topics: the dead, the afterlife, the digestive system... pick your poison. She's always funny.I also learn a lot of fun, cool, and interesting stuff from her books. She is so smart and so engaged - even with the minutiae - that she never fails to delight me and educate me. She finds so much joy in science and learning that it's impossible not to catch some of it.One thing that was putting a smile on my face while reading this book was Roach's cute little flirting and sexual excitement of being around these Marines and Special Ops guys. She likes men, I like men, and I was enjoying how much fun she was having describing her new surroundings.Fallon turns the class over to ArmorCorps' Craig Blasingame, a former Marine with a wide superhero jaw and muscles so big that when he walks in front of the slide projector, entire images can be viewed on his forearm. Though it's ten in the morning, Craig has a five o'clock shadow....Craig speaks like a bullhorn. He says this is because he lost some hearing as a Marine, but I think it's because there's so much strength coursing around in there that everything - whiskers, voice, the pectorals under his polo shirt - wants to burst forth in a powerful way.Of course, she runs into many men she gets to admire and appreciate. In this book it is flirty and cute, but in EVERY book she has a knack for describing people in a unique, clever, and vivid way. It only happens to be provocative here because she is a straight woman plunged into this kind of environment, but in other books she just blows your mind with some of her startling ways of describing people - I often wonder what they think of it when they end up reading her book.The Army Research Laboratory snapped up Nicole Brockhoff, premed at John Hopkins, with a graduate degree in biodefense. The youngest person to win the Secretary of Defense Meritorious Civilian Service Award. Bench presses 190. She's come down from her office in the Pentagon to attend to some things, and agreed to make me one of them. Whenever Mark takes over the explaining, Brockhoff drops back and takes out her phone. She does not seem rude, just grindingly busy and determined to stay on top of her day. I see her come and go in my peripheral vision, pacing, answering email. She gives the impression of someone for whom idleness is almost physically unbearable. She is gorgeous, articulate, fast-moving, powerful. Lesser humans are left blinking in her wake.I highly recommend this book, or any of Roach's books. The only reason I'd hesitate is if you are squeamish. She doesn't gross you out for the sake of grossing you out, but in general I'd say the disgusting really fascinates her instead of repulses her and you should take that into account.Her compassion and kindness always glimmer through. She despairs about the dead, especially since the dead soldiers are so young, but she doesn't bog down the book or get maudlin about it. You can see her good heart peek through all the humor and science. It's one of her (many) good qualities. I also love learning and always walk away from a Roach book feeling a little bit more informed. She loves science and history and is able to dig up obscure facts and figures that you would never find out about on your own.Tl;dr - Take a little trip with Mary Roach as she pulls back the curtain on the miltary's less-publicized wars: against diarrhea, heat exhaustion, flies, and hearing loss. Great book for both fiction-lovers and non-fiction-lovers. Mary Roach is funny and smart - you will find yourself grinning while reading this if not laughing outright. Highly recommended. Five stars.Lieutenant Couturier, a circadian rhythm researcher at NSMRL, outfitted a planeload of Navy SEALs with blue light-emitting goggles on a series of flights from Guam to the East Coast of the United States, to see if it were possible to make them unattractive to females, oops, I mean, to keep them on Guam time."

6,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45248887-greta-g,4,"I have to admit I had never heard about Mary Roach or any of her books before, until my attention was drawn to Grunt, after one of my GR friends rated the book 4 stars. After reading the synopsis and some reviews, I was convinced that I would like this book. And I definitely did. Not because of the humor with which she writes but because I'm the kind of person that hasn't stopped asking ""why?"" since I was a toddler. Grunt provides a lot of information to questions that I have or could have about all sorts of fascinating facts. For instance, when I was reading books about the aftermath of the Hiroshima bomb, I was horrified to learn that the victims' wounds swarmed with maggots, and that everything was black, covered with flies. Why do flies thrive while everything else extinguishes?This question is only answered partly in Grunt, but I learned a lot more about flies and maggots. And I have now an apocalyptic image in my mind of how the world would look like after life would be destroyed. It's a black & white picture, of flies and maggots , who will be the last survivors on earth until they cannibalized themselves. 

Every now and then, Mrs. Roach also provides good advice to readers, for instance never sleep in the open without underpants. If you saw House MD, you probably already knew that. It goes without saying that if your yuck factor is above average, you don't want to read this book, as it is packed with discomforting stories and unsettling facts. Therefore, it is an interesting read for most of us. 8/10"
7,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33447134-book-riot-community,0,"Mary Roach is one of the few writers that I just wait around, twiddling my thumbs, waiting for her to publish a new book. I don’t even care what the book is about. In fact, I’m pretty sure when I pre-ordered my copy of Grunt, all I knew about it was the title. Mary Roach is a must-read for people like me… people who are fascinated about science but aren’t necessarily knowledgeable on the topic. As in all of her books, Roach explained the science of how the military life impacts human beings in a way that was both hilarious and completely lacking in condescension. She holds her reader’s hands through complex scientific explanations without them ever feeling as they’re being talked down to. Grunt isn’t my favorite Mary Roach (Stiff will always take that spot in my heart), but she didn’t fail at bringing her particular brand of irreverence, humor and intelligence to a topic I previously found myself ambivalent about.— Elizabeth Allenfrom The Best Books We Read In June 2016: http://bookriot.com/2016/06/29/riot-r..."
8,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5903843-matt,4,"Roach is back for another scientific look at the world around us, this time honing her attention on the US Military. In ways unique to her, Roach is able to look at various aspects of military life and explore the informative components while injecting little known (or considered) facts about the process. Consider, for example the depth to which the Department of Defence has studied various materials for uniforms, from their flammability, coolness (temperature) factor, and even lack of fashion-worthiness. The controversial world of camouflage does not elude Roach, as she examines just how much thought (and many tax dollars) goes into a decision. However, this only skims the surfaces of her analyses, as she ventures into the world of prostheses, which are common among the injured returning from the battlefield and wishing to hold onto some semblance of their previous abilities. The reader might not expect the significant amount of attention paid to penile prosthetic implements and the surgery around trying to handle injuries to the area. Of course, Roach does not shy away from this, nor does her exploration keep her from asking (and writing) about the wonderful world of diarrhea, particularly for those deployed to 'non-first world domains'. Have you ever wondered what a sniper would do if they were hit with a bout of 'the runs' while scoping out an enemy? Roach has and writes about this, at length. From there, it is exploration of flies and maggots, both of whom have been the focus of numerous studies by the US Government. Of course, no examination of the military would be complete without discussion of weapons, though Roach chooses some less than expected armaments when she researches and talks about the odorous weapons that US Military brass chose to develop and deploy. Stink bombs, scents that would be displeasing to a cross-section of various ethnic communities, as well as the disturbing results of focus group studies (that many asked would actually consider wearing a vomit scent as a daily cologne/perfume!). While out of sights, Roach refuses to keep those aboard submarines out of mind as she examines sleep deprivation and circadian rhythms for the men and women prowling the deepest seas. Roach has outdone herself yet again and left me with tears in my eyes, trying to stifle a laugh in a subtle cough as I sat in public. Enjoyable for anyone, but preferably not read anytime near food consumption.It could be Roach's delivery or her refusal to find anything off limits, but she has gone to the margins of possible exploration and then forged ahead. Her discovery of the most random areas of research and highlighting them in major portions of her chapters shows not only a strong grasp of the material, but also that she is able to synthesize it effectively. The reader will, if they are anything like me, remain agog of all the minutiae that comes to the surface while also constantly asking just how far Roach will push the envelope to add fodder to her books. She seems to write so seamlessly and with such confidence that the reader can absorb all that is presented and feel it is highly useful at the next dinner party or family gathering. The chapters remain all-encompassing though the entire book remains under 300 pages, allowing the reader to leave the experience without being too weighed-down with facts. Kudos, Madam Roach for taking us into the world of the military through science rather than the incessant ISIS babble that fills the airwaves today. Like/hate the review?

Plenty of other works have covered similar ground (these are the sorts of things that, as a writer, one researches!) and I didn't find a great deal here that I didn't already know or have some conception of. Roach's writing style is as adept and sure as always, but by the end I was hoping for something a little more dramatic and mind blowing than the revelations offered here. "
10,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36873041-amanda-never-mandy,4,"My husband purchased this book and he lasted only four chapters. Don’t worry, this is normal. He loves books but doesn’t usually have the patience/time/want to read them all the way through. It used to bother me until I realized I could push him towards books I am willing to read so I can claim them after he abandons them. He happened upon this one after I told him I wanted to give this author a try. This isn’t the book I had in mind off of her list but it seemed to capture his attention for the moment so I begrudgingly agreed.I love the author’s wit and sarcasm and especially love the perfectly timed use of it. It never failed that anytime I hit a dry spot her wit would shine through and bring me back to the page. I also enjoyed the content as odd as that may seem considering it wasn’t the most exciting information ever provided. I think that was exactly why I enjoyed it so. The info shared was the stuff you hardly ever hear about, stuff that is extremely necessary and actually quite important. The most stick with me info I pulled from this book was how far science has gone with correcting/rebuilding male genitals after they are damaged and the bit about the heel fat pad. The first item I listed is pretty self-explanatory and if it isn’t, then feel free to read the book yourself. The second item is actually something that just fascinated me. The fact that the fat pad literally carries the weight of a person’s world on it and we haven’t figured out a way to recreate it. I think it is the only piece of fat on my body I can actually say is useful besides the two slabs of meat that provide me with a soft cushion to plop down on or bump into things with."
11,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1629797-maria-v-snyder,5,"I bought this book because I kept seeing it in various bookstores throughout the mid-west back in August and I was curious (my background in science and interest in the military helped, too). Seems Mary Roach has been writing a bunch of these books and I had no idea! *I'm blinking in the brightness after crawling from my writer's cave*The book was a fascinating read and I can't believe how much thought, time, and money goes into something like uniform fabrics. And I can't believe what Mary was willing to do and see and go in order to get enough information for her book. She watched surgeries, was around corpses, spent time in a submarine. I'm super impressed and thinking that learning how to blow glass for my books is really really tame in comparison! :)She doesn't shy away from the sensitive or awkward subjects and she spends an entire chapter on flies and maggots (just don't read that chapter while you're eating and you'll be fine!) so be warned.I now have a better sense and appreciation of what our soldiers have to deal with (besides bullets and IEDs and RPGs and suicide bombers, etc...) when deployed. Thank you all so very much!I already have Spook on my TBR pile and I suspect I'll eventually read all her books. One good thing about living in a cave, is when you do find an author you like, there's a good chance they have a nice back list to catch up on :)"
12,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4859943-lynn,4,"The science of keeping military personnel alive and intact covers many areas of expertise and I was kind of surprised that Mary Roach got so much access and cooperation. The military representatives' honesty about the science behind catastrophic injury, amputation, hearing loss, dysentery, human stress and panic reactions, sleep deprivation, and the casualties of war was astounding to me. Amazingly, they let her on a deployed nuclear ballistic submarine. As with all her books, I learned lots of interesting stuff. I didn't initially want to read this book when I saw the title because I figured it was about the science of weapons.....but not a mention. My respect for U.S. armed forces dramatically increased."
13,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1496564-robin,5,"Roach (quoting the publisher’s description), “…explores the science of keeping human beings intact, awake, sane, uninfected, and uninfested in the bizarre and extreme circumstances of war.” And Mary says, “I'm interested in the parts that no one makes movies about -- not the killing but the keeping alive.""I have loved every book Mary Roach has written (STIFF is still my favorite, followed by PACKING FOR MARS) and was waiting with great anticipation for her next book, but quite frankly, when I heard it was about the science of war I was a little disgruntled as I try to avoid anything war related. But there was no reason to worry. This is an amazing book, one that will have you exclaiming every five minutes, “Whoa, I didn’t know that!” or, “Huh. Isn’t that fascinating”?A few of the topics covered are uniforms (did you know there is a 22-page document covering clothing button specifications?), how soldiers cope with the heat (Roach’s explanation about heat exhaustion vs heat stroke was very well explained), scents created for warfare (not to kill but to discourage, such as one titled ""Who? Me?""), and how submariners deal with bad things happening (like water cascading into the vessel). But my favorite part (and one I don’t recommend for the squeamish) is the chapter on using maggots for wounds (yes, it is used in modern medicine), and only Mary Roach can get away with calling baby maggots “adorable.” (I said this in a tweet and in typical Mary Roach fashion she replied, “Like so many of Earth's creatures -- only when they're young.”The bottom line is we should all realize how special Mary Roach is and how lucky we are to have her curiosity and diligence so we can be enlightened and entertained in the ways of science. Plus her sense of humor is freakin' hilarious."
14,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/275498-jim,4,"With this offering Mary Roach sticks to her usual formula of investigative reporting with a touch of self-deprecating humour. Essentially, she delves into ways that science is used to facilitate warfare and improve conditions for fighting men and women both pre- and post-warfare. Throughout, she maintains an easy conversational tone and relates her findings in terms anyone can understand. I remember thinking that she described some of the physical afflictions, such as heat-related medical emergencies, in a way that I finally felt that I had a grip on it.Some parts of the book will bring back flashbacks for any old soldier. The sections pertaining to fatigue and sleep deprivation brought back unpleasant memories. I recall that, during training exercises, directing staff thought it important to drive us for as many days as they could with little or no sleep, as if you could train yourself to overcome fatigue. The resulting sleepwalking and hallucinations might seem funny in retrospect, but it was good to learn that fatigue is finally being looked at as a problem by the military.It occurs to me that Ms Roach has an enviable job. Her research takes her to many unique environments and she meets all manner of interesting people, all of whom get full credit in print. She was even able to finagle herself aboard a submarine! An interesting read if you don't mind being educated on some gross topics like filth flies and explosive diarrhea."
15,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32911939-morris,4,Mary Roach has done it again with another great book about the more macabre side of science. It's packed full of interesting facts and explanations of different processes that is easy to read while being entertaining.

How would the takedown of Osama bin Laden have played out had one of the SEALs been fighting the forces of extreme urgency? How often is food poisoning the cause of a mission fail?"" (152)Grunt: The Curious Science of Humans at War by Mary Roach is a combination of hilarious intrigue, informative data, and the consequences of service from a variety of battlefield conditions soldiers have continually faced since the profession came about. While the above quote contains hints of playful intrigue, questions like these Roach asks researchers and soldiers in the book are no doubt fascinating and a totally different (yet highly important) way we look at war and the men and women who fight in them.Besides the example of diarrhea from third world foods and living conditions, Roach looks at examples such as effective zippers for snipers working in a prone position, the physiology of both sweat and sleep to a soldier or sailor, the psychology of combat medics, non-lethal psych-ops of smell (both good and bad) i.e. latrines or homemade bread, and many other arbitrary yet crucial items of importance. Perhaps one of the more important contemporary examples of medicine combined with science is the reconstruction of male genitalia for unfortunate soldiers shot in the groin. Roach's trip to Walter Reed Medical Center and seeing the advances in technology and understanding of this condition thanks to the transgender community was very insightful and brought light to a little-known subject from military medical circles.That is the strength of this book, how it provides hints of humour alongside very important pieces of science that for many of us wouldn't even cross our minds. When one thinks military service, one is picturing heroism, patriotism, and perhaps the negative attributes of PTSD from combat. It's hard to believe nobody that has served in the military is thinking of the high statistics of diarrhea from serving in Iraq or being stationed in Djibouti, or the critical research like flame resistant clothing being done at the labs at Natick. Roach has done a great honour bringing light to the researchers, scientists, and doctors who bring these little instances of triumph that we as a public don't hear about and can't fully appreciate."
19,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32532051-montzalee-wittmann,4," Grunt: The Curious Science of Humans at War by Mary Roach is another wonderful book by a women that tackles subjects and picks them apart for us readers. I have read all her books and love every one of them. The first few books were so funny that I laughed in every one but she has been getting into my serious stuff lately. She still makes reading light where she can but what I enjoy is that she finds things about the subject, in this case, humans at war, and explores the smallest things that we would never even think of and let's the rest of us know what she finds out. It is truly fascinating the strange and unusual info that is obtained by reading her books. They are never boring and she keeps it lighthearted when she can. She explores and investigates things I never would have thought to investigate. I hope she keeps up the great work and can't wait for her next book. Will keep watch at the library!"
20,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20048096-pamela,3,"Let me start by saying, Mary Roach is one tenacious, iron-stomached, courageous and quirky humored, journalistic writer. She certainly doesn't shy away from asking some very personal, probing questions, delving into some fairly unique and sometimes grossly disturbing topics related to military science, survival, recovery, and endurance. For that, I commend her. She has penned one fascinating, unabashed non-fiction doozie. Indeed, Grunt is a fascinating read, no question about it. The writing quality, however, not so much. A bit hither and yon. And I must note: you might not want to read this shortly before or after eating a meal; or with thoughts of intimacy. Many of the topics and chapters were, for me, a bit unappetizing and/or uncomfortable to read about: Cadaver research - in DETAIL, maggots, diarrhea, sweat and other body pheromones, odor manufacturing as weapons, and penis reconstruction for IED victims . . . just to name a few. Due to the nature of the book, I could only read one or two chapters per evening. A couple times I thought to set it aside completely, but Roach's humor lightened the text just enough that it was doable. Plus, it opened up dialogue between myself and my husband - Dail - Navy Chief, retired, disabled. Dialogue that gave me a better understanding of what he endured during Vietnam as a Corpsman attached to the Marines, and then later as a Spec Warfare instructor attached with and for Navy Seals. All of which was before we were married. Therein, sometimes the value of a thing, isn't the thing itself, but that which it leads to.THREE **** No Holds Barred, Tenacious Journalism **** STARS"
21,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/695116-jim,4,"Mary Roach is a hoot. In her introduction, she says this book isn't about the typical military stuff. She doesn't shine a spotlight, but is a 'goober with a flashlight' looking around in all the odd nooks & crannies. For instance, she starts her introduction discussing the chicken gun. Yes, it shoots chickens to test how well aircraft & other things stand up to bird strikes. No gory details, just a slightly humorous discussion of bird sizes, densities, & how the tests protect the pilots.Table of Contents1) Second Skin: What to wear to war A lot of fabrics can make things worse by melting or making wounds worse in other ways. Sometimes the safest just don't work out in the field, though.2) Boom Box: Automotive safety for people who drive on bombs figure out how best to use the limited amount of armor that can be put on a vehicle. It's not just its frame & tires, but the terrain it has to navigate, including roads that can get ruined in short order. They also look into injuries to spines & legs in an attempt to stop them from happening or at least alleviating them.3) Fighting by Ear: The conundrum of military noise is that weapons are loud & can ruin hearing in short order, but ear protection can mean not hearing enemy movement. Sure, there are mechanical aids, but they require batteries. How many different types of batteries can a soldier be expected to carry & how often do they need replacing?4) Below the Belt: The cruelest shot of all has become very common with IEDs buried in & along roads. It's not just legs, but what's between them. Loss of sexuality is usually worse than the loss of a limb.5) It Might Get Weird: A salute to genital transplants see above. They're trying hard to fix the issue.6) Carnage Under Fire: How do combat medics cope? Making complex decisions under pressure is tough. Making them when loud noises are going off is even worse since we reflexively tend toward fight or flight - simple actions.7) Sweating Bullets: The war on heat is a bitch. We need to sweat, soldiers need to cover up & carry a lot of equipment, often in temperatures they're not acclimated to. 8) Leaky SEALs: Diarrhea as a threat to national security sounds like a joke, but it's not. The statistics for 'death by dysentery' were higher than those by combat for most of history. It's not just spoiled food, but nasty latrines with flies shuttling shit back & forth.9) The Maggot Paradox: Flies on the battlefield, for better and worse Flies aren't all bad. Maggots can clean a wound better than a surgeon even with modern equipment under the best conditions. 10) What Doesn’t Kill You Will Make You Reek: A brief history of stink bombs Crazy OSS hijinks with super secret stench. The trouble is, one man's stink is another man's perfume or at least not nearly as bad. Funny, but she never mentioned skunk.11) Old Chum: How to make and test a shark repellent would be better titled ""Sharks, why bother?"" Another total boondoogle.12) That Sinking Feeling: When things go wrong under the sea things really go bad. No thanks!13) Up and Under: A submarine tries to sleep was surprising. Not allowing people proper sleep seems ridiculous even when it's not easy to accomplish, but I know hospitals do it, too. Her stats on cognitive function loss are scary, especially considering what they do.14) Feedback from the Fallen: How the dead help the living stay that way by seeing how immediate treatment methods were applied, if they could have been applied better, or if they need changing. Very cool.As usual, it was entertaining, but I finished the book feeling as if a lot had been left out. I don't really know why, but I could have read a book twice as long & I'm sure she had plenty of other topics to cover. Maybe she'll Grunt twice."
22,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9369133-happy,4,"In Grunt, Ms. Roach looks at what the scientists working for the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) are doing to support the men and women going in harms way. In her research she visits several DoD research centers and bases. She talks to the people doing the research, those developing the products based on that research and probably most importantly to the people who will be using those products.The first the topic she looks at is how the military develops uniforms and the requirements behind them. It really is not as simple as picking out what looks the best and whipping some clothes. The military is trying to make them as heat resistant and blast proof as possible while still being relatively inexpensive and wearable. I know from personal experience this is not as easy as it sounds. I was in the Army (early '80s) when the BDU was adopted as the work uniform. It was supposed be all weather - all climate, so no summer weight uniform was developed. Then Grenada happened and the soldiers deployed found the BDUs was just too d*** hot to wear in the tropics. While they were hurriedly developing a light weight version of the BDU, we were authorized to wear Viet Nam era Jungle Fatigues - at considerable less expense to those of us that had to purchase uniforms $8 a set vs $32. While she is looking at uniform development she also talks about how sometime fashion does come into selection of uniforms. She gives the example of the camo craze and the Navy’s adopting a Navy specific camouflage daily work uniform. When she asks one the Navy officers in charge of the developing the uniform why it has to be camouflaged, he basically says – I don’t know, maybe so we can’t find someone who falls overboard. The next topic she explores is vehicle development – and the why and how the MRAP (a mine resistant vehicle that was developed to withstand IEDs) came to be.The science behind keeping the soldier/marine/airman/sailor healthy and able to perform is not skimped on either. Whether it is putting a soldier back together after a catastrophic injury, keeping him for contracting dysentery, having a heat stroke or preventing hearing loss all are looked at, some times in stomach churning detail. When she is exploring heat exhaustion/heat stroke, the author give quite a detailed explaination on how it occurs and why it is so dangerous..Ms Roach does not only look at the current science, but gives a short history lesson of some of the attempts the military has tried to use science to develop unconventional weapons. One of the highlights is the attempt in WW II to make an aroma so foul that when it was somehow put on an unsuspecting Japanese officer he would lose face and become ineffective as a leader – it didn’t work. They couldn't find a universally foul order that worked over all cultures.Finally she spends some time with Submariners and looks at how the Navy is trying to make their lives easier while on patrol, including sleep schedules and how they can get out of a disabled vessel. She writes with a humorous, self-deprecating style as she navigates the Acronym factory that is the DoD. I found this book a fascinating read, if a little uncomfortable at times. A word of warning to those with a weak stomach or reservations about talking about sensitive subjects. She is very descriptive, as I mentioned earlier, at time stomach churning in describing the causes and effects of diarrhea. Also, due to the nature of many of the wounds coming out of Iraq and Afghanistan, she spends considerable time with the surgeons and researchers at Walter Reed (among other hospitals) exploring what the DoD is doing to help servicemen recover from injuries to the genitals. This includes but is not limit to reconstructing the penis and actually transplanting said organ.As an old soldier, I found this a fascinating look at where the modern military is heading and very fun read – definite 4 star read"
23,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/864779-sarah-shoo,5,"I first must admit that I've loved Mary Roach's books since I discovered Stiff, so I'm not sure that this is a totally unbiased review. She is able to take subjects that shouldn't be in any way, shape, or form entertaining, and she not only makes them interesting but real and engaging.She goes beyond the obvious in this, and all her books, to find the odd and the obscure. (Where does she find this stuff?! 22 pages of button specifications in the military fashion handbook???? Chicken guns????) Before discovering Roach, I would've told you that I didn't prefer nonfiction, and before I read Grunt, I would've told you I didn't prefer books on war. I think this is because she is ""interested in the parts [of war] that no one makes movies about -- not the killing but the keeping alive"".Roach brings her wry humor, her ability to find the interesting in the mundane, and her ability to tease out the important bigger picture in this mundane to Grunt as with her previous novels."
24,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49847688-emily,3,"This was really interesting! It's a thorough examination of a few niche areas of military science, but not much else. It's doesn't really try to contextualize that science within the broader American Machine of War, which is its great shortcoming. I understand that Roach's avoidance of reckoning with the bloody, exploitative legacy of the American military was probably because that is almost too large to grapple with. But the entire lack of that context left me feeling... Not Great."
25,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31857555-jody-mcgrath,3,"Actually 3 and 1/2 starsNot my favorite Mary Roach novel. Still amazing, I mean it is Mary Roach. I just felt like she could only be a spectator a reporter for this book, whereas, so many of her books she is a huge participant. She did participate when she could, this is Mary, but due to a lot of it being military and government stuff, she could only tell us their stories. Still an amazing book. Mad props to the men and women of the Armed Service and all those who support them, whether it be, family, friends and community, or the unseen volunteers, body donors, janitors, food service personnel and everyone else in between. We get to sleep easier because they all do their job. Thank you all for making my life better."
26,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1484853-simone,4,"New Mary Roach book? If you are a fan of Mary Roach books, this does not disappoint. This book mostly pokes around the hidden underbelly or hidden corners of the military industrial complex, where there are large research budgets dedicated to all kinds of scientific discovery. Roach does a great job reminding people why these things matter. For example, it matters the kind of fabric soldiers are wearing, because it can have serious effects when they are shot at or things explode. Like Packing for Mars: The Curious Science of Life in the Void this is in part about the scientific discovery that is possible when unique problems meet researchers who are unafraid to take risks and are able to find the funding to support them. Because this is a Mary Roach book all the usual suspects are here: investigations are likely to lean in the direction of ""prurient interests,"" (there are two chapters dedicated to genital injuries and transplants), talk about diarrhea, sex and cadavers. But here she is able to explain that these things are not often talked about but often really matter. Penis transplants may seem weird, and not an injury that politicians can feel good about putting an arm around a soldier's shoulder for a photo-op, but they are traumatic, and can seriously impact a returning veteran's quality of life. Same with hearing loss. Basically, I highly recommend this. (Many thanks to the publisher for providing this ARC in exchange for an honest review.)"

This book is a salute to the scientists and the surgeons, running along in the wake of combat, lab coats flapping. Building safer tanks, waging war on filth flies. Understanding turkey vultures.
I've only read one other Mary Roach (Stiff, which I remembered as worthwhile, but rereading my review for it just now, I realise that I wasn't that impressed by it at the time), and Grunt follows the familiar path: Roach is given free access to the scientists working behind the scenes on a topic (in this case the topic is “the curious science of humans at war”), and as she follows her own interest trail (quipping and keeping everything light), the reader get vicarious glimpses at those squirmy things we're glad others are doing instead of us. While there was something universally interesting about Stiff (after all, we will all die eventually and our bodies will need to be dealt with), I didn't feel the same way about Grunt: and it's not just because I'm not an American, and it's not just because I'm not a “human at war” – there was simply very little of interest to me about the science behind the material used for combat fatigues; nothing universally instructive about the future of penis transplants; little point to a chapter on the failed history of shark repellents which concludes that the US Navy has had no real problems with shark attacks. Roach's writing is interesting enough, and I was impressed by the access she was able to gain (to military hospitals, bases, even riding along on a nuclear sub for a week), but ultimately, Grunt didn't do much for me. As before, I got the sense that Roach had a lot of affection for the scientists that opened their labs and offices to her. And, as before, her descriptions of these scientists are always charming, as in:
Jerry Lamb is a droll, upbeat soul, his essential good cheer yellowed but slightly by two and a half decades with the Navy.
And:
Nabors carries the evocative title Diving Officer, and seems built in keeping. His hair is buzzed to a half millimeter, his wedding band tattooed. Nothing disrupts the hydrodynamic flow of Eric Nabors in a wetsuit.
And, as before, Roach uses footnotes to make quirky asides; often at her own expense:
As someone for whom the phrase “top secret” has applied mainly to decoder rings and campy spy movies, I had to remind myself that these were actual security classifications. I found it hard to take seriously the sign on the chain stretched across the navigation room door saying, TOP SECRET – KEEP OUT. They may as well have added NO GIRLS ALLOWED. I saw a printer in the crew lounge labeled SECRET PRINTER. Secret printer!Early on Roach explains that this book is not about guns or other weapons, but about the safety equipment that is constantly in development for the Armed Forces. She covers everything from toilet paper to ear plugs, and along the way, takes a close look at battlefield diarrhea and the exploding lungs of those who surface too quickly during a submarine evacuation. Poignantly, she ends the book in the mortuary where autopsies are done on all who die during their service, and when she asks about the presence of a stepladder, she's told that it's for the photographer:
The autopsy photographers need to get up high to get the whole body in the frame. I guess war is like that. A thousand points of light, as they say. Only when you step back and view the sum, only then are you able to grasp the worth, the justification for extinguishing any single point. Right at the moment, it's tough to get that perspective. It's tough to imagine a stepladder high enough.
Grunt was interesting enough to keep me reading, but ultimately, I could have given it a pass. Yet, I wouldn't be against giving Mary Roach another go."
30,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5887880-lorilin,4,"I honestly never knew war was so...complicated. I don't think I ever considered how important it is for soldiers to have underwear that is lightweight, durable, AND moisture-wicking. Or how damaging birds can be to military aircraft. Or how vital it is to have a good surgeon around when you've experienced lower body trauma. (Yikes.)Grunt is a unique book, to say the least. It would have been easy for Roach to get bogged down in the detailed ridiculousness of it all, but she never does. It's obvious that she loves researching this weird stuff, but she also stays light. Even when talking about things that are, well, kind of sad, her tone remains playful, honest, and, weirdly, fun. Her joy made me like the book even more.My only minor complaint is that Grunt feels like several abridged books lumped together. Every time I finished a chapter, I would think, okay, now we are going to go into more detail about this or that particular thing in the next chapter. But, instead, Roach moved on to an entirely different topic. It was always an INTERESTING different topic, but I kind of felt like I was being forced to move on when I wasn't ready to yet. That's a nice problem to have when you're reading a book, but it still tends to feel like a problem.Regardless, though, I liked this book. It's not the sort of thing I usually read, but I definitely understand the appeal. I think anyone who enjoys slightly quirky, kinda weird, fact-driven books (like Freakonomics) will like this one, too. ARC received through Net Galley. See more of my reviews at www.BugBugBooks.com."
31,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11481458-guillermo,0,"Grunt is not your typical military science book. Mary Roach is not ""interested in the parts no one makes movies about-not the killing but the keeping alive."" Roach produces a well researched, captivating, at times humorous and succinct foray into what it takes to keep soldiers alive in the evolving modern battlefield of the 21st century. This was not a topic I was particularly interested in, but Roach's style really drew me in. Submarines, stink bombs, shark repellant, and maggots oh my. It was quite an interesting smorgasbord of topics to wade into, although to it's detriment (or perhaps to it's credit), the chapters of each different topic were fairly brief. Despite this, I came away from Grunt having learned much more than I thought I would from this slim volume. If anything, I think I finally understand how sweat actually cools our body and what the tissue is best for constructing a penis for an implant is. Thank you to NetGalley for giving me the opportunity to read this book in exchange for a review. "
32,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3397530-lea,5,"Mary Roach hits it out of the park once again with this one. She's quirky, interesting, and always, always funny. This time she's taking us on an exploration of military science, and boy is it fascinating. Roach asks the questions I think we'd all like to ask, delicately balancing curiosity with a deep respect for those whose lives are on the line -- she has a lot of compassion for military personnel, which in my opinion adds to the charm of her writing. The worst part about this book is that . . . it's short. And as her most recent, we probably won't be seeing a new one for a while. I guess I'll have to make do by re-reading her previous books -- they're all winners.Highly recommend."

Like, testing the effect of red underwear on morale? Providing navies with caffeinated meat? Shooting chickens on windshields? All that and more weird and quirky things (queasy stuff too) is really quite typical of Mary's books. I am a bit disappointed that she didn't write anything about the latest military tech (say, killer drone or invisibility cloak), but I guess it can't be helped. "

I'd definitely recommend if you're looking to learn more about what goes into carrying on a war, some of the consequences you may not think of, and just some crazy stuff the Government has tried to develop in the name of war."
36,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3267184-lamees-al-habeeb,3,"I have always been fascinated with wars*, war-related psychology and war-themed artwork: paintings, literature, film, etc. That’s why when the news first came out about this book I was very excited! I literally counted the days leading up to its release. But alas, my excitement was short-lived. I was disappointed; I didn’t find military science to be very interesting. What I got from the book was a clearer picture of what it’s really like out there. Mary describes the environment surrounding a solider in a battlefield in exhaustive details. There were chapters on the science that goes in designing uniforms, and combat vehicles, there was also a whole chapter dedicated to earplugs –an important, albeit tiny, piece of soldiers equipments- and the detrimental effects of military life on hearing.Before reading this book, it never occurred to me that military science and the research budget assigned to it are of this massive magnitude!*I can come up with a myriad of explanations for this very specific inclination, but I think it largely stems from a very early childhood memory. When I was about 9, I watched the movie “Lion of The Desert”, a biography about the life of the Libyan tribal leader Omar Mukhtar, and his long fight against the Italian colonization in the years leading up to WWII. The scenes from the movie –showing battlefields and interrogation rooms and of course the trial and hanging of Omar Mukhtar- got imprinted in my head and filled it with questions I was then too young to know how to answer. It’s a childhood fascination that grew with me, and I’m still searching for answers."
37,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10407443-ross-blocher,5,"This was a no-brainer for me, as I'll read any book Mary Roach writes. Not since my Tom Clancy days have I been particularly interested in military operations, but Roach's curiosity and humor can make any topic fascinating. She'll contact an expert in a field, visit the location, ask unusual questions that most of us are too polite to put into words, and describe what she encounters in the most entertaining way possible. There's a constant play of words, with Mary Roach planting a word or phrase within a description and then plucking it up again later as delicious double entendre. She'll immediately sniff out any pretense of formality or prudishness and find the honest human emotions lying directly underneath. She is sharp, playful and irreverent, but not at the expense of anyone other than herself.On the menu for this book: the fabrics used in soldiers' uniforms, building tanks to handle improvised explosives, military hearing loss (who knew it was so common?), dealing with damaged genitals, medic training, surviving extreme heat, ""diarrhea as a threat to national security"", medical maggots, stink bombs, shark repellent, bears and menstrual blood, surviving a submarine accident, sleeping on a submarine, and learning from autopsies. If none of that is enough to pique your curiosity, just know that you'll be rewarded with some unexpected facts to tell your friends and at least a few laugh-out-loud moments."

39,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2220787-ram,3,"A book about some scientific and research aspects related to modern armies.Clothes, armor and vehicle protection, medical treatment of various combat related injuries and many other issues. Some more interesting than others, some more comical than others. Some parts were better than others, but none of the issues really stuck in my mind.“Sometimes courage is nothing more than a willingness to think differently than those around you. In a culture of conformity, that’s braver than it sounds.” “US government button specifications run to twenty-two pages. This fact on its own yields a sense of what it is like to design garments for the Army.” “What can be done for these men? A lot. The art of phalloplasty—crafting a working penis from other parts of a patient’s body—has come a long way (thanks in no small part to the transgender community).” “Three hundred feet down, seawater slams through a two-inch hole with enough force to bend a knee the way knees don’t bend.” "
40,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7354786-katie,4,"The past few years I have been working slowly but surely through the works of Mary Roach. I find her style to be intoxicating, even if her subjects seem a little outside my own personal interests. When announced that her latest book would be about the science of war I was immediately wondering how her light-hearted and comedy heavy style would work with this subject. Once I realized that she was, as usual, going to focus on the weird eddies of science and discovery. In her introduction, she refers to herself as “the goober with a flashlight stumbling into corners and crannies, not looking for anything specific but knowing when I’ve found it.”Full review: https://faintingviolet.wordpress.com/..."
41,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2976142-thomas-edmund,5,"Being familiar with Roach's other works I wasn't too surprised that the focus would be on the obscure or less ""heroic"" aspects of military technology/science, although I have to confess initially I was disappointed with a relatively benign first chapter about how soldier gear is balanced.I needed have been though, very quickly Roach dives through quite intense subjects, amputation, penis reconstruction, maggot treatment and submarine sleep schedules. Roach handles each subjects with a sublime combination of humour, respect, and robust research which is simultaneously enjoyable and poignant. This is particularly noticeably for the final chapter where it almost feels like Roach intentionally taps out early, horrified by the deadly consequences of war. That's not to say the book is preachy or moralistic, Roach tackles the subject with humility and taps into the human side of everything she delves into. Overall Grunt strikes a perfect balance of factual interest, ""human-sides"" and creative writing. Highly recommended."
42,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3932962-barbara-the-bibliophage,4,"Grunt wasn't entirely what I expected, in fact it was better. I was expecting it to cover how guns, ammunition, or vehicles are made better for human use. In fact, it was much more about humans themselves. For example, it covers our hearing and our limbs in the military. Then author Mary Roach gets deep into insects and other small critters, and how they affect humans at war. This book had some quite serious ""ewwwww"" moments, enough to suggest not reading while eating. If you like medicine, physiology, and want a deeper idea of how humans work under the stressful conditions of military life then this is the book for you."
43,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17061542-zoe-s-human,5,"Non-fiction is seldom this fun. Grunt is a great book for people who love to learn about random aspects of larger fields. Did you know the military has a use for a chicken gun? Did you ever think about all the factors that need to be considered for a uniform? Has it ever occurred to you that diarrhea is a serious military concern?All of this and along with tons of other things that I never would have thought to ask are presented in layman's terms with humor. I would issue one caution. Animal testing is referenced in here. It's not gone into in any detail, but some experiments are described which might be upsetting to some."
44,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5749733-steven,3,"While I liked the topics covered in the book, the manner in which they were tackled were sometimes strangely colloquial (e.g.,when the author gives advice on how to pronounce terms: ""MRAPs"" (say, em-wraps)), the variations in 'voice' between sections/essays could have been smoothed out, and some of that colloquialism could've been replaced with some more details, as some truly interesting items were seemingly glossed over.2 stars for the writing, 4 for the content, 3 overall."
45,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2531665-charlene,4,"So often when authors want to explore gross things in depth (maggots, diarrhea, penis transplant, etc), and they use humor to do it, I end up being put off. Roach, however, never fails to make me laugh. I would call her books, including this one, ""science light,"" but when she does detail the science, it's always done with a lot of awe and passion. Her writing style works for me.This book, like her others (except for her subpar My Planet), was quick, informative, funny, and entertaining. After having read Stiff, I decided that I loved her. I would read just about anything she writes. So far, I am rarely disappointed. "
46,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71658-aj,4,"3.5 stars--As with all books by Mary Roach, Grunt takes a serious, possibly gruesome topic and turns it into a fascinating exploration of science and research. I have to admit that I wasn't planning on reading Grunt, even after having read Bonk, Spook, Gulp, Stiff and Packing for Mars. Fighting and war are just not topics that I enjoy reading about. And I must say that out of all Mary Roach's books, I enjoyed Grunt the least. However, I'm glad that I did read it, minus the chapter or two at the end that had too much discussion of sailors drowning for my taste."
47,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5790437-aj-sterkel,4,"Likes: If I made a list of all the things that interest me, military science would not be on it. Honestly, military science sounds like the most boring subject ever. So, what drew me to this book? I was interested in its author, Mary Roach. People have been recommending her books to me for years. I was told that she could take a boring subject and make it fascinating. When I found Grunt at a scratch-and-dent book sale, I decided to give it a shot. Let’s learn about the fascinating world of military science.All you book recommenders were correct again. (I need to stop doubting you.) Mary Roach has an engaging, humorous writing style that can draw the reader into a dull subject. She makes military science interesting. The chapters are fairly short, so the reader never feels inundated with tedious details. Instead of focusing on weapons and killing people, she focuses on how the military keeps people alive. The chapters cover everything from clothing design and stink bombs to diarrhea research and the training of new medics. The military spends our tax dollars on some wonderfully weird stuff. I approve.I like how hands-on the author was with her research. She actually involved herself in the science and became a test subject. That’s courageous, considering all the dangerous and disgusting stuff the military seems to be into.“Sometimes courage is nothing more than a willingness to think differently than those around you. In a culture of conformity, that’s braver than it sounds.” - GruntDislikes: Since the book covers so many subjects, some parts are more fascinating than others. I had a hard time getting interested in the book because the first chapters are about fashion design and armored trucks. Those subjects didn’t hold my attention. By the time we got to prosthetic limbs and penis transplants, I was hooked. (Don’t judge me for being curious about penis transplants. They’re interesting, okay? Don’t pretend you’re not curious, too.)I think the book could have used an editor to smooth out the clunky sentences. I found myself rereading a few times. The clunkiness isn’t always the author’s fault. In the military, everything seems to be an acronym. How does anyone remember what they’re talking about? Why can’t they just give things shorter names?The Bottom Line: It exceeded my expectations. The various subjects interested me enough that I stayed awake until 2 in the morning to finish it. Do you like reviews, giveaways, and bookish nonsense? Good news! I have a blog for that."
48,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11010029-james-rank,5,"Incredibly fascinating look at the science questions I didn't even know I had about our military, and so well written to boot."
49,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31467977-tom-quinn,4,"I really enjoy Mary Roach's writing. She's breezy and conversational and strikes just the right balance between reporting and making jokes. She's got that ""Everyman"" narrational tone of curious-observer/fish-out-of-water down perfectly, and she's relatable and personable and consistently just plan charming. I like her pacing, her selection of smaller details to frame larger concepts, e.g.As sometimes happens in rural America, someone has shot up a road sign. The sign — a right-turn arrow on a yellow background — stands on a paved lane along the edge of Chesapeake Bay. Given the gape of the hole and the fact that the road traverses Aberdeen Proving Ground, there's a good chance it wasn't made by a bullet. A proving ground is a spread of high-security acreage set aside for testing weapons and the vehicles meant to withstand them. In the words of the next sign up the road: Extreme Noise Area. (53)But she's also informative, at just the right level to teach something without delving so deep as to lose the friendly engagement she holds our attention with. For example, in the context of the U.S. Army's research into preferred fabrics for uniforms, she pauses her description of a spill-test to say:Liquids that are mostly water have high surface tension. That means that the molecules perfer to bond more strongly to each other than to most of the things you might spill them on. A liquid with lower surface tension, like alcohol, won't bead up on a fabric the way water will; it soaks right in. A bead of water is a molecular huddle, a withdrawal inward, a refusal to join hands with strangers. (35)She's very adept at seeding these tidbits of information in a way that is informative enough to teach a complete novice something relevant and engaging enough not to bore someone who already knows the concept.4 stars out of 5. It wasn't as striking as Stiff and I know I won't retain most of what I learned after closing the cover on this one, but Roach still sets the standard for pop science writing in my opinion. She does return to the wells of her previous works, somewhat disappointingly, and tells us often of cadavers used in military testing. Seems her first book continues to cast a long shadow over her subsequent titles. But my only real complaint is that I noticed so many sentence fragments they grew jarring. Did she always write this many and I didn't notice, or did the frequency of their use go up here?"
50,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12798350-andrew,4,"Grunt: The Curious Science of Humans at War, by Mary Roach, is a pop-science book written on interesting military technologies that most would overlook. Instead of examining guns, bombs, missiles and the like, or going over topics like PTSD and insurgency, well covered in other books, Roach shines a light on the dark corners of military research. Topics covered range from a number of unconventional products and ideas that are nonetheless important to improving the lives (and indeed saving the lives) of combat soldiers. Roach focuses primarily on the US military, and travels extensively to various R&D labs in the United Stats, as well as to overseas military bases in Djibouti and the like, to examines, interview and participate in a wide variety of experiments.Topics vary throughout the book. The composition of US military uniforms is examined in detail, from the fire-proofing chemicals that go into them, to the expense of manufacturing, to the placement of buttons on Sniper vests. All of these topics effect the safety and comfort of soldiers, while also maximizing cost efficiency. Roach looks at armored cars that prevent ergonomic injuries from IED blasts to the undercarriage. The health and mental wellbeing of combat medics is examined. The use of diarrhea medicine for combat soldiers is also detailed. Roach spends two chapters on the reconstructing of male genitalia damaged in combat situations (no-joke, and very interesting and terrifying). Maggots as combat dressings are examined. Shark repellent is detailed. Underwater flotation devices are touched upon. Roach ahs written short, 20 page chapters on interesting and odd military devices used in a variety of situations, all with the stated ideal of improving the lives of combat soldiers. The book is sprinkled with wit and humour. It is written entirely in a journalistic fashion, with very few sources per chapter, and an abundance of one-sided interviews (a negative in my mind). Even so, the book was interesting, entertaining and short. It offered an interesting view of military logistics beyond grand strategy, jingoistic military biography, or examinations of weapons. It is a deep look at the gadgets and tech that no one thinks about, and the people and ideas that are behind them. An interesting book of pop science style, but a fun read nonetheless. Easily recommended as a short read on an overlooked topic, but not as a deep examination of anything in particular. "
51,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3325574-melanie,5,"I cannot get enough of Mary Roach!From smells, poop and diarrhea, to shark repellents and Kevlar underpants, Roach looks at the science behind a lot of major issues that face the military. And no, it's not about weapons. Grunt cover so many random pieces of military science that people just don't think of. Like what do snipers do if they have the runs? How do people on submarines deal with never seeing the sky? Are there problems with sleep deprivation? The answers, by the way, to those questions are 1)they ignore it like everything else and just let go, 2)poorly, and 3)all the time, which isn't great for a group of people sitting on a nuclear-powered sub.Roach's particular brand of humor is part self-depreciative (she isn't exactly a trained soldier, but does her best!) and part ""can you believe this?"" conversation. She is brilliant at making science approachable, and broadening the reader's perspective of something that they normally wouldn't think about. I mean, who knew that penile reconstruction surgeries were something so important? Other than the soldiers who suffered major damage from IEDs and other weapons. But it is important. And we should be doing everything possible for the soldiers who were injured while serving the country. And it's great that Roach is able to bring attention to this and other things that slip past the collective consciousness of the country."
52,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3424260-kerry,5,"This time around, Mary Roach takes a look an Military Science, the science tasked with helping to make the military as effective as possible. This book is not about the weaponry, though, it is more about people and what it takes to help them perform at their best. As she says, ""I'm interested in the parts that no one makes movies about -- not the killing but the keeping alive."" As in her previous books, she finds interesting people doing interesting things and helps them tell their story. She finds people trying to find better ways to protect soldiers with better clothing and armor. Scientists looking for ways to protect them from heat, noise, pests, and diseases. In some of the best chapters, she talks to the doctors looking for better ways to heal them when they are injured.Reading a book by Mary Roach can be alot like going to a party with a great host. You meet interesting people, hear some good stories, and learn about thing you never knew before. This books comes out in June. I can't wait for you to read it too."
53,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12554712-john-of-canada,5,"I love Mary Roach.I first encountered her in The NYT by the book column and was flabbergasted by her wit.I have read a lot of her articles for Readers Digest,and she never ceases to amuse me.When reading Grunt,it felt like I was tagging along on her adventures.She is never unkind,and her conversations are so vivid that I could imagine being in the same room with her.I did get pretty squeamish when she described a certain transplant operation.I wonder if law enforcement agencies have been aware of her writings re:survival stress response and training.I'm sure it would be helpful.Although it reads like Dave Barry does science,I learned a lot more from this than if I had read a pure science book.And she is not a scientist!She does a good job of translating scientific terminology,e.g. psychomotor vigilance=""paying attention and noticing shit"".Her use of humour is a nice break between some difficult topics.I am going to get everything she has ever written."
54,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/667234-james,5,"Maybe Mary Roach's best yet - definitely in the running for funniest of hers I've read (except for the last chapter, Feedback From the Fallen, subtitled 'how the dead help the living stay that way,' which is achingly sad at times.)As she notes in the beginning, this isn't about weapons or killing. It's about the science and technology used to try to keep military people alive while other people, or their own dangerous jobs, are trying to kill them. It covers some ground that was unfamiliar to me even after 20 years on active duty (although I did retire in 1996) and ongoing study of the literature of the military since then.Highly recommended both for veterans and other readers familiar with the military and for those less familiar but curious. Fascinating as well as frequently hilarious."
55,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4688706-ayelet,4,"I learned some crazy things in this book. And it caused me to think about the soldiers on the wearing end and receiving end, what their bodies need as they are placed into highly unusual situations.At times, Roach was hysterically funny, making very clever connections and plays on words. But at other times her snark felt mean. It is amazing the access she was given - in operating rooms, in submarines- and the way she was able to distill complex science for the masses. A lot of time people only give credit to those who deployed. But what about the people who thought about the buttons and zippers they would wear so that they could do their jobs without revealing their positions? Everyone's job is important. "
56,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51089-jamie,4,"I’ll tell you what technology we need to look into: cloning Mary Roach. She is a delight. We should all be half as curious to engage with the world as she is, and half as thrilled to meet people who do the same. The way she loves people and ideas and gross stuff, the weirder and wilder the better… she’s my kind of woman."
57,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28754029-bey-deckard,5,"I think this is my second favourite of Roach's books after Stiff . It's not a book about warfare or guns or politics. It's about the people—scientists, technicians, doctors... fashion designers—that keep soldiers safe and hopefully in one piece.It was an eye opening, often hilarious read because Roach is such a pain in the ass with her persistence. :)___An aside to my brief review of this excellent book:I've always had a fascination with the military. When I was a young'un, recruiters for the cadets came to my high school. Twelve-year-old me bent their ear for a good half hour, asking all about various career paths and opportunities with them. Satisfied, I dutifully filled out the registration forms, needing only the signature from one of my parents. I was going to be a cadet and later on a soldier, because what better place was there for someone who's calm under pressure, is extremely resourceful in new environments, is a good marksman, is unafraid.... and had a growing wildness that could lead to trouble if it wasn't nipped in the bud? I figured rigorous structure and discipline would do the trick and my less favourable traits could be put to good use. I didn't count on my parents being staunch pacifists. They refused to sign.So, I never joined up... by the time I was old enough to sign up for military duty on my own, it was too late. I was lazy, had no respect for authority and delighted in undermining it every chance I got, and I was far too much into partying.However, the fascination remained and though I'm fascinated with the military... I don't like war. I do like the tech. Most of all I like the brotherhood/camaraderie that shared danger and discomfort creates. Heh, so I used to live with a grunt, a gunner, and an army pilot. Later on, I lived above two US army guys who were in Montreal over the summer on leave who would come upstairs to watch military documentaries with me and drink all my beer. Hell, one of my favourite exes is an ex-Peacekeeper who was wounded in Afghanistan) On their own, these folks were easy to understand, normal(ish) sort of people... but you got more than one soldier in a room, suddenly the language completely changed. It was all acronyms, shorthand, jargon, and cursing. Even the tone of voice changed to a lower register... and body language took on more familiarity while becoming ritualized and exclusionary in essence (later, I would go on to write an ethnographic research paper on the language and rituals of [fictive] kinship within the military). One thing I very much enjoyed about Roach's description of everything in Grunt is that it was peppered all over with exactly the sort of unease, awe, hesitant or incredulous amusement, and feeling of otherness (or of feeling like you're no longer speaking the same language) that being around soldiers brings out in your average civilian... all while being respectful to her subjects. I'm definitely reading this one again. Oh, and I think I marked about thirty quotes, but since this is the hardcover, I have to transcribe them by hand at a later date."
58,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38036772-annie,4,"I don’t know how this woman gets so many people to let her into the inner sanctums and shell out honesty. She’s gotta be so persuasive that if I ever killed someone I’d beg her to be my lawyer, even though she doesn’t have a law degree. Look, it’s wild enough she consistently manages to get into multiple medical facilities (in every book she writes), into a penis transplant patient’s room, into an impressive variety of government test facilities, and endless else. But how the fuck did she manage to wriggle her way into a remote anti-terrorist drone base in Djibouti to ask some Special Operations guys about their runny shits? Or into a submarine with nuclear reactors and missiles to ask if they’re getting enough naps? How?Mary (I think if you read all of an author’s books save one- I’ll get to Gulp soon!- you have the right to be on a first name basis) is great too because she’s totally unpretentious and asks the stupid questions or comments we’d all make in her place (“It’s so nice of them to leave cupholders in the tanks, though.” *Brief, polite silence.* “They’re rifle-holders.”). And who, like me, is almost like a teenage boy in her zeal for doing things just because (“Shoot me with a paintball! I want to know what it feels like!”).She also just has a way with words. With images, really. “Using long-handled forceps, [the surgeon] passes the dangling [piece of mouth tissue to be used to rebuild a urethra] to [the assisting surgeon]. They look like a couple sharing a Chinese entree.” Thanks, Mary. Chinese will never look quite the same.On the heels of that thought, I really need to learn that I just can’t read Mary’s books while eating lunch. I have to stop attempting it. I’m not squeamish, but she has this uncanny ability to use food metaphors for grisly things. Cutting a penis and having a penis “spring open, kielbasa-like.” Rolls of cadaver skin compared to cannolis. That sort of thing. I always just end up putting down my nice, polite veggie sandwich down with a sigh. I also need to learn not to google image search things she mentions. Cholera cots. Medical maggots. Nope. As always, Mary supplies her reader with a great ride. She’ll have you laughing and also checking out your forearm to imagine what the skin would look like made into a makeshift penis. And it’s fun when you can start putting her zaney factoids together for your friends (“Did you know sweat comes from blood plasma? (Grunt) Just like vaginal lubrication! (Bonk)”). You have lots of things to tell your male friends that get perceived as veiled threats (“Did you know cut open prostates smell good?” “Er… we have a problem, Annie?”). She also has a gift for meandering away from the original topic in such a way that you neither notice nor care. You have already buckled your seatbelt and you will let Mary drive you off a cliff if that’s her fancy. For instance, today I learned that polar bears are more attracted to a used tampon than to just about everything except seal blubber. They don’t care about real blood, just menstrual blood. Perhaps, Mary offers serenely, it’s “some kind of secretions that, please forgive me, smell like seals.”God bless you, Mary Roach, for you are not a normal person. Tell me you have another book in the works already."
59,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1143969-julie,4,"Gosh but I love Mary Roach's nonfiction so much. She writes in such a fun, breezy, conversational tone (even as it's grounded in extensive research and consultation of professionals) that I just devour these chapters really quickly. I love the way she flings herself headlong into the strange, kooky corners that others haven't explored yet, just uprooting rocks to see what she can find underneath.I preferred Packing for Mars just because the topic of space is nearer-and-dearer to my heart, but military science is fascinating, too: all the unexpected research and carefully-considered variables that go into making the war machine work, into taking care of soldiers and both trying to protect them and to optimise them. Roach gets into hearing loss, sleep deprivation studies, submariners' training, shark repellent, combat uniform design, the deleterious effects of diarrhea on a mission abroad... pretty much any bonkers thing you could think of, she looked into it. A lot of it is not good reading while you're eating dinner, lemme tell u.And then occasionally she just bowled me over with lovely prose, that was lovely without obscuring the actual facts of the text:Both ""squeeze"" and ""pull"" are exaggerations of the motion applied to [the M16] trigger. It's a trivial, tiny movement, the twitch of a dreaming child. So quick and so effortless is it that it's hard for me to associate it with any but the most inconsequential of acts. Flipping a page. Typing an M. Scratching an itch. Ending a life wants a little more muscle.The book ends a little abruptly in its last chapter about death, but with such a poignant paragraph that it lingered with me for a while. I got the sense that there wasn't much else she could think of; that it's hard to find the right words. Breezy as the writing style might be, you still see Roach's respect for the science that goes into these endeavours, but also her grief for the young soldiers we're feeding into this horrible meat grinder. The moments where she reveals her own naivete, only to be gently put back into her place by one of her military consultants, are always striking; she's always aware of where the gaps in her knowledge lie, and how particularly chilling that is when it comes to war. Example:And the Stryker was never a lushly appointed vehicle. There is no onboard toilet. (There are empty Gatorade bottles.) The early ones didn't even have air-conditioning. I tell Mark I'm glad to see some cup holders were left in place. I recognize the brief, polite silence that follows. It's Mark Roman rendered mute by the fullness of my ignorance. They're rifle holders.Great stuff, as always. Excited to keep reading more things by her."

62,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4272284-kristina,4,"Mary Roach makes science fun. I mean, I think science is fun anyway, but she makes it accessible for non-scientists and she makes it practical. Grunt: The Curious Science of Humans At War is her latest book and I enjoyed it very much. Once again, she tackles scientific topics no one else would think to address and she does it with curiosity, respect, humor and enthusiasm. Grunt explores the science of war and the problems soldiers must deal with (other than the reality of being shot or blown up). After reading these chapters, you realize how much we truly owe our soldiers.I never ever would have thought about military uniforms. Never in a million years. But here’s Roach with a whole chapter about this very topic. Apparently, the fabric of a uniform can affect a soldier’s ability to fight well. That seems like common sense now, but who thinks about this stuff? This is what a modern uniform must do (or come as close as possible): If possible, the army would like to dress its men and women in uniforms that protect them against all that modern warfare has to throw at them: flames, explosives, bullets, lasers, bomb-blasted dirt, blister agents, anthrax, sand fleas. They would like these same uniforms to keep soldiers cool and dry in extreme heat, to stand up to the ruthless rigors of the Army field laundry, to feel good against the skin, to look smart, and to come in under budget. It might be easier to resolve the conflicts in the Middle East (21).She should have added that they be quiet—zippers and buttons and velcro can be noisy and noise can give away a soldier’s position. Extensive testing of fabrics and designs goes on at the US Army Natick Soldier Research, Development and Engineering Center. It’s extremely involved and high-tech. From equipping soldiers with the appropriate clothes to putting them in vehicles that will shield them as much as possible from explosions and gunfire, Roach moves her focus to the human body itself and how the military tries to repair war injuries. Roach being Roach, she doesn’t discuss the usual prosthetics. Why should she? It’s a well-researched topic. No, Mary explores what happens when men have groin damage and their genitals have to be reconstructed. Penis transplants are also now possible. Roach witnessed the procedure (done on cadavers only) and said that by the time the book is published, the first ever penis transplant may have occurred. This chapter was kind of gross, but also very interesting. Roach discusses the possible psychological problems these transplants may cause.The problems of diarrhea, the helpfulness of maggots, and the strain of heat exhaustion are all topics covered in more detail than you may care for, but that’s Mary Roach—she doesn’t leave anything out. The chapters dealing with life in submarines was the most interesting for me, probably due to the lasting impressions the movie The Abyss had on me. I first saw that movie years ago and to do this day I’ve been fascinated with the idea of submarines and the perils of underwater living. It’s also a kick ass movie and I highly recommend it; it vividly shows the consequences of sea water pressure on mechanical objects. Mary Roach is a delight. Her self-deprecating humor and willingness to be a human guinea pig whenever asked (seriously, read her book Bonk. She does not embarrass easily) makes her science books fun to read. She asks the questions you would be reluctant to ask (even if it occurred to you to ask them) and she enthusiastically pursues the answers. If you’re interested in science, read her books. Even if you’re not interested, read her books. I think Mary Roach’s books should be read by high school students so they can understand that science has very real and practical uses. Plus, they will realize that it’s fun."
63,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4361541-barb-middleton,4,"Every time I sit down to write this review, I struggle with the right words and can't help but feel like a ""goober"" myself. Journalist Mary Roach has a terrific voice that makes this science piece easy-to-read and while I laughed, for the most part, there were other times when it was too much. I am glad I read it after, ""The Pentagon's Brain: An Uncensored History of DARPA, America's Top-Secret Military Research Agency"" by Annie Jacobsen because it gave me some historical context that is lacking in Roach's book. Roach is upfront about not specializing in history or science, ""I'm the goober with the flashlight, stumbling into corners and crannies..."" Parts of her story were interesting, others not, and the end definitely abrupt; however, I appreciate the attempt to create characters that are easily visualized. Although even that got repetitive at times. The book doesn't quite nail it, but it is worth reading if you want to know about the side of the military that gets little press such as fabric design for combat, blast wounds, medic training, hearing loss, types of repellents, phalloplasty, and diarrhea to name a few. Her self-deprecating humor and figurative language add to the light tone and great voice. She pokes fun at her lack of knowledge throughout such as thinking that a mechanic's tattoo of pistons are martial arts weapons because of his fierce appearance. On a ship, she makes the mistake of identifying rifle holders as cup holders. She creates characters through detailed descriptions that I liked but became somewhat repetitious, particularly at the start. It seemed most people were gorgeous, adorable, or muscular: ""She is gorgeous, articulate, fast-moving, powerful. Lesser humans left blinking in her wake"" or ""...with a superhero jaw and muscles so big that when he walks in front of the slide projector, entire images can be viewed on his forearm"" or "" you wouldn't use the word distinguished but adorable."" Another officer is ""droll"" and ""adorable"". Even the maggots are ""adorable"" as ""they move like inchworms, like something you might see humping along the pages of a children's book."" That image gave me pause. Here's another one, ""His incisors touch down on his lower lip like children jumping on a bed."" No adorable, but an interesting simile. A fun made-up word is, ""The whole business is straight off my fathometer."" Sometimes she kapow's the reader with phrases that hide her lack of depth on a topic. Other times the book has a seriousness and poignancy that is insightful. She admires the bonding of soldiers and selflessness that defies reason. A man that lost both legs was more concerned about his fellow soldiers being okay than the fact he'd just stepped on an IED. Or how another soldier lost his limbs but said the worst part was losing his hearing because it made it so difficult to communicate with his wife and children. Or the part about how much the government spent millions on shark repellent based on one man's experience and another's political connections. She nails it sometimes and misses the mark at others. And the chapters are connected in a loose manner. As a journalism major, I enjoyed and admired how Mary Roach wrote this piece. She tackles many different topics and perhaps this is the downfall. It might have been better if she had focused on fewer. If you are looking for something historical or scientific then you might want to pair this with another book. "
64,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1345046-todd-martin,3,"Grunt is Mary Roach’s latest book in which she examines technologies associated with  The Curious Science of Humans at War. Well, not really ‘war’ per se, her approach is to focus on technologies involved in keeping soldiers alive and comfortable while minimizing any discussion of weapons, killing or the subject of war itself. This is rather a fine line to tread since the purpose of keeping soldiers alive and comfortable is so that they can do their job (which often involves the use of lethal weapons to end human life), but Roach is known for writing about quirky science topics in an off-beat and humorous way, and the act of creating a fist sized-hole in a human body with a high velocity rifle round isn’t a subject that naturally lends itself to hilarity. Roach is also flirting with a topic fraught with controversy (the bloated US military budget, politicians pork barrel spending, US foreign policy, the national debt, unilateralism, torture, wars of choice, terrorism, drone strikes, civilian casualties, friendly fire, war crimes, the military industrial complex, the treatment of veterans, suicide rates, the conflict in the Middle East and on and on). Her approach is to desperately seek subjects that provide a safe haven so as to avoid any possibly of providing offense (while still managing to work excrement and genitalia into the conversation … obviously). Thus she has chosen to discuss such minutia as: the fabrics and fasteners used in military garments, vehicle armor, hearing protection, penis reconstruction surgery, dysentery remedies, heat exhaustion, sleep deprivation, and others. It’s not that these topics are unimportant (the clothes worn by a soldier while patrolling in a brutally hot desert environment certainly play a role in their comfort, safety and effectiveness), but by focusing on individuals who sweat the small stuff, she’s making a conscious decision to willfully ignore the big stuff. I'll also point out that, other than her coverage of submarine rescues, the remaining topics apply just as much to civilians as they do to the military. Roach is also extremely careful in her use of humor in the book, restricting it mainly to that of self-deprecation. A typical example follows the formula:Roach: Oh look, these uniforms have such cute pockets. They’d be perfect for carrying accessories like my bedazzler or a fresh banana. Military Personnel: That’s magazine holster for an M16A2 assault rifle ma’am.{Cue the trombone}: Wah - wah - waaaah.Given the carefully contrived scope of the book, I would characterize the restricted list of topics discussed as modestly interesting. But after having read most of Roach’s other work I feel like her ‘unflinching glimpse into salacious topics’ style has crossed over into the realm of self-parody. Enough already with the preternatural preoccupation with pee-pee, ca-ca, and the orifices from which these substances emerge."
65,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51152697-kate,4,"This is a book about military science: the study of those things that might affect personnel in combat.he author has a reasonable sense of humor which is much like the military and black humor I am used too. In several places I laughed out loud, as when someone heard a rumor that red fabric had cooling properties. The Army decide to test this in the Philippines and had red under ware designed and ordered and red hat liners...they were anything but cool and the men sweated in places no one wants to sweat, and the red dye ran when wet down into the men's nether parts staining them much to the humor of the control group who wore white under garments. This was 1908 and the services were still on a learning curve.It covers everthing from uniform design, specifications for buttons, why zippers don't work special needs of snipers in gear requirements. How cloth is selected and engineered to wick moisture, retain body heat or allow cooling in hot desert climates. Uniform design: although it didn't mention helmet design which I have been told has been responsible for some of the serious facial burns in IE explosions. The research on the amount of water needed in desert conditions when soldiers burdened with a hundred ponds of gear, armour, supplies and munitions have to expend energy in day time heat of 120-135o. It also covers how the body beaks down when too much water is consumed.Of course it addresses the gigantic toll of intestinal distress from contaminated food, flies and sand tics, and the research that was started during the Spanish American war up to present.Studies and testing to properly armour up vehicles, how to protect bodies within vehicles from the tremendous bone shattering concussions. Much other research is cover in sections, how to prepare Medics to cope with the carnage of the injuries caused by modern weapons.Very interesting book, having family members that have worked in procurement, a son who was a Medical Officer in serving in theater I was familiar with some of the things covered, and the complaints of those who did not want one more piece of protective gear to weight them down or obstruct their movement. A good read for anyone not familiar with what many of the military research teams deal with."
66,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1462387-karyl,5,"Mary Roach is like that little precocious kid that always asks, ""But WHY?!"" I don't think she ever grew out of that stage, and that is lucky for us. She has so many questions to satisfy her curiosity about literally everything, and it's that which fuels her books. I knew I was going to enjoy this book, simply because she wrote it, but it's even more amusing yet fascinating than even I had imagined!I'm glad that Mary Roach didn't go into the normal things you think of when you think of war -- things like guns, or bombs, or IEDs. Instead we look at the fabrics the military uses in its uniforms (I am rather glad I was ignorant of how easily flame retardancy washes out of fabric after my husband finished out all his years at sea, since his favorite coveralls were about as old as some of the guys under him), keeping troops safe when driving through dangerous areas (who knew they'd have to completely redesign the crash test dummy for upward impacts?!), hearing loss (something I'm quite familiar with, since my husband spent the last 23 years in the engine room of various warships), what happens when a guy gets shot in the junk, even how to keep troops free of diarrhea in the field. There is so much in this book that the average person just has never thought of in regards to military science, and of course, Roach injects her own brand of humor at just the right times for a little bit of levity. Read this book, even if you have zero interest in military science. It's funny, it's informative, it's just a good read. I found myself reading out whole pages to my husband while we were on a long drive, and now he (almost) wants to read it himself!"
67,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8733987-christina,4,"This was my first experience with Mary Roach. While the topics she chose to research were fascinating, it was her sense of humor and how it blended in to her style of writing, that I could not relate to at the start of the book. I wasn't sure if she was mocking, making light of or was just generally trying to be funny, in regards of the areas she chose to research for this book. For this reason, I spent the first couple of essays a bit pissed off that she could possibly be making light of such a respectful arena. By about the 3rd chapter, I got a feel for her general reverence and then it all just clicked. I'm a believer and I want to get my hands on all that she has to write. Roach has the ability to bring to the light of day, areas of the military that we may never even give a moment of thought about and surely not consider of importance to the bigger picture of soldiers and the theatre of war. So, not only does she look into the nooks and crannies of the American military, she gives credit to ALL of the MEGA-research that goes in to daily operations that one may not even consider. In doing so, Roach helps to bring a shared glory to the Military as a whole, something that I know doesn't happen often enough. I gained a lot of respect for her writing when I made this realization, and I further appreciated the knack she has to make it all so readable. I highly recommend this to any one who has a bit of time to take a little trip through some of the little known and often really weird, areas of military research and operation. "
68,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17379348,4,"This is my first Mary Roach book. I have been meaning to read something of hers for a long time, but when I won an ARC of Grunt, I really had no excuse anymore.So here's the thing. I have a big problem with people who glorify war and who think patriotism excuses despicable acts such as mass murdering. If this book worked for me, it's because it didn't focus on the killing aspect of war, but rather on the surviving. There was no chapter on guns or explosives. In fact, the only weapon mentioned in this book was something called Stench Soup, which was as life-threatening as its name implies.Roach is very funny and relatable, and her curiosity is contagious to the reader. There were certain points in the book when I was not sure what her opinion on war was, or even if she wanted to express one, but that was clarified at the end of the book. Which brings me to my last comment: I really liked the note that the book ended on. I am very particular about endings. Fiction or non-fiction, the way a book ends can make it or break it for me. And by ending, I do not mean the last chapter or even the general resolution. I mean literally the last couple of sentences. Roach, though, wrapped it all up perfectly.To wrap up myself, reading Grunt was an overall very good experience. I laughed, I shuddered, and I learned all kinds of information that I was never meant to know. And when it comes down to it, what more can you ask of a science book?"
69,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2222340-chris,2,"What a disappointment. Grunt it is not. The author's penchant for monosyllabic titles has done her in. Maybe Boom would have been better because this book is not about grunts. The cover has an infantryman with an absurd amount of gear on his back. Yet there is only a page or two about the infantryman and his obscene loads. The subtitle of the book more accurately conveys the substance of this book: the curious science of humans at war. Some areas you would expect some coverage she omitted: woman in combat; NBC defense; biological barrier of flight; vision-we own the night with NVG's and infrared; PTSD; drones and robots; to name a few. What she does cover is two chapters on genital wounds and a long and perhaps irrelevant chapter on stinky things. I enjoyed the chapter on hearing.She was trying to inform and also entertain simultaneously and she didn't pull it off with me. Flippant footnotes in too small a font. Her overly dramatic account of trying to get special operators to talk to her about diarrhea fell flat. This book got rave reviews but it was written by and for the 99 percent of clueless Americans who as the military say ""are at the mall"" while the 1 percent deploy continually in ""endless war."" This book is described as witty, mischievous, fun, and entertaining. Since when has war been that?"
70,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4882193-paul,4,"As with other Mary Roach books I've read, I thoroughly enjoyed this one. And I knew a bit about the subject matter, the military science of keeping soldiers, sailors, and airmen alive, healthy, and at their peak. In my case, it is aviation medicine and physiology. I flew fighters for the USAF, so I know all about altitude chambers, the infamous Nazi experiments of WWII our present-day cold water survival charts are based on, and the improvements we've made over the years in ejection technology. Mary Roach didn't get into the aviation side of military science with this book but she did explore in detail such topics as military clothing, boots, rations, armored vehicle technology, diarrhea and dysentery, the unique injury patterns associated with IEDS and other explosions, submarine escape systems, and sleep management ... critical subjects all, and not often thought of by anyone other than soldiers who have to perform an all kinds of crazy and dangerous environments. Her trademark humor is very much in evidence, and one simply cannot stop turning pages. In case you can't tell, I love Mary Roach and will read anything she writes."
71,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2505581-gary-brecht,3,"A book definitely not for the squeamish, author, Mary Roach, pulls back the curtain to peek at the efforts of our military to protect and patch up our combat soldiers. The reader is given a tour of a wide variety of military units that specialize in such things as testing protective clothing and gear; training submariners to survive a sunken submarine. She introduces us to surgeons who must deal with the physical and psychological consequences of lost limbs. We discover that there is an ongoing analysis of combat deaths where experts examine the remains of fallen soldiers in an effort to learn ways to prevent future lethal incidents. Throughout the book Roach’s dry wit acts as a relief valve for the otherwise serious content. When all is said and done about the heroic efforts of these support units, one still marvels at how cavalierly our leaders commit our youth to war."
72,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17367460-jim-angstadt,4,"GruntMary RoachAnother fast, fun, satisfying read from Mary Roach. The title is a little misleading. One might suspect that this book is about the military in general, or the army in particular. But, really, it is about numerous often overlooked areas of military operations, namely, clothing, vehicle design, genital surgery, staying focused during chaos, diarrhea, bug control, smelliness, sleep deprivation, and more.The author brings out the science behind these topics, and in the process, illuminates many talented, committed, generous, behind the scenes personnel - doctors, scientists, lab workers, staff - who are doing very good work."
73,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8734097-p-d,4,"As always, Roach's books are a delight to read because they ask questions we wouldn't think of asking. When you're told to come up with the main challenges facing a modern soldier, you probably aren't going to name sleep deprivation, diarrhea, or hearing loss right away. She does mention right away that she isn't here to politicize anything, and that she is deliberately not going into PTSD/mental health because there are whole books that do a great job with the topic—but this shouldn't be too surprising as her writing has been consistently quirky, interested in the perspectives without judging them."

Thankfully, Roach has gone before and asked the awkward questions. Yeah, new weapons and planes and ships have to be developed, I knew about those enormous contracts.. But also someone has to work out all the other stuff: what things do people really need to carry? what’s the best way to keep people alive? What makes a weapon ideal? Roach is out there following her curiousity to places I never considered, and arousing mine.Library copy"
75,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4070288-jo,3,"I love Mary Roach, and her usual interesting facts and humor are on display in this book, but the tone did not match the material as well as it usually does. She took a quite cavalier and breezy approach to the military, improvements in military technology to prevent horrifying death, and military spending. Only the very last sentence of the book addressed this at all. The chapters also seemed less coherent then usual, covering the army, the navy, genital reconstructive surgery, a shark project from the 1940s, among other subjects, and not adding up to a general picture."

This book took me places I did not expect to go and I now know something about genital reconstruction and a lot more about poop. Mary makes me a more interesting person. She also does the best descriptions of people. I'd love to find a way for her to interview me about something, just so that I can read how she chooses to describe me.I love what she's doing for science writing and as always, I would happily recommend this to anyone who thinks they don't enjoy nonfiction or someone who finds science writing intimidating."
77,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2127955-holly,5,"I  am so thankful I stumbled across Mary Roach. I never would have thought I would enjoy a non fiction book about science...let alone one involving the military. But she has this way of making the most complicated subjects approachable, and so, so fascinating. Roach gives readers a glimpse at the science and humanity behind the people who go to war, instead of the war itself. I just love her to pieces. In fact, I may be developing a bit of a nerdy girl crush on her. #noshame."
78,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53176851-mrs-europaea,4,So interesting to read about the science of war. Mary Roach has a wonderful way of making hard subjects appeal to an average reader and she did this wonderfully in Grunt. Her dry humor and awkwardness makes what could be boring and wordy entertaining without discrediting the hard work of Service members or scientists.

Interesting but not great, and occasionally gross. Roach really likes the gross-out stuff. Not my favorite of her themes.OK, I finished it, more or less. Definitely a mixed bag. I might try it again later, which has worked for me for some of her other books."

The anecdotes and information are intriguing, but they're brought to us without any meaningful order, quite disjointedly in fact, and they don't add up to any deeper insight about military life or war, which makes them meaningless.

84,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2007216-peter-derk,4,"Great. Like always. Mary Roach, self-described ""goober with a flashlight"" delivers. Some jerkoff in The New Yorker felt like there were too many jokes in this book, or that Roach's formula failed her this time. If you don't already know how I feel about that review (I DID just call the reviewer a jerkoff), then I'll clarify: that person's kind of a jerkoff.Seemed to me they were all put off because it seems like Mary Roach is having a laugh at the expense of soldiers, which A) isn't true and B) means we were cool having a laugh at astronauts and cadavers in Roach's previous books, and those folks are pretty brave, important, and exposed if you ask me.I thought the critique was especially weird because this book, of all of Roach's I read, finished on a very sweet, thoughtful note. Well, I thought the critique was weird until I remember it was a book critic, so the person probably didn't even read the damn thing.And you know what? If you don't see humor in the idea of stink bombs, this clearly isn't the book for you. Nor is this the Earth for you. Because there is A LOT of smelly shit hanging around here, and some of it's pretty comical. "
85,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6085797-elise,4,"In her typical hilarious style, in this book Mary Roach tackles the science of war. Not the science that will kill the most people on the opposing side, but the one that will keep the most people on this side alive. She participates in a training session for medics in the middle of a battlefield, visits a base in Africa and goes around the mess hall asking about diarrhea, visits a submarine carrying nuclear warheads... all with humour and the greatest respect for what she's describing. Always with the funny anecdotes that will make you literally laugh out loud while you're reading.As in the other two books I read by her, I loved the construction of this one, how each chapter neatly segued into the next one. And the conclusion was lovely, the last sentence was perfect."
86,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1205220-matt,3,"I'm the arrogant sort of person who when I rate a book think that there is some objective element to my rating, and that I'm not merely rating how much I personally enjoyed the book, but also on some level how worthy the book is of enjoyment and how much quality was exercised in the crafting of the book from the level of the individual sentence on up to its grand conceptions and story arc. You might say that in rating a book, my expectation is that everyone else will enjoy the book to within +/- a star of what I rated it, depending on how much the material personally appealed to you and how much - for whatever reasons - you were willing to overlook the books evident flaws. Otherwise, if I did not in fact believe this, whatever would be the reason for rating a book, for if my rating was wholly subjective it would do you no good whatsoever. Mary Roach's book ""Grunt: The Curious Science of Humans at War"" and similar books challenge those presumptions somewhat, in that I don't think a simple one dimensional rating system can in this case predict how much the book will be enjoyed. While for me the book was largely, ""Meh"" and parts of it were grating, that's because the book is pitched at a target audience that just falls outside of anything that would be a sweet spot for me.What's Roach is writing is essentially a primer on basic science and engineering, organized around one of the most interesting fields of basic research in the world today - America's high tech war machine. In an academic world too often focused more on publishing results than doing good work, much less doing anything hard and then managing to repeat it, the Defense Department could care less about how much you publish or where you publish, just so long as you give them tangible solutions. It's research wing DARPA is continually at the forefront of progress. Yet for all this, it's also not just interested in fighting the next war, but also the next and the next, and so very interested in the basic research that may lead to great advances way down the line.Roach approaches this material from a welcome angle, of looking at the less glamorous less macho programs that aim not to create better means of killing people, but rather solve other equally important basic problems of being human in a battlefield environment. For most of human history, man versus nature was still more lethal and more important on a battlefield than the other tribe with its weapons trying to kill you. Infection, disease, starvation, and exposure to the environment killed more men on most military campaigns than the battles did. Roach puts a lens on the modern Defense department's continuing research into keeping soldiers physically and mentally fit during the hardships and horrors of war, and she does so with a self-deprecating, rapier wit and an outsider's eye for the unusual, the bizarre, and details others might miss.It could be the making of a book I really enjoy, but the basic problem here is - I already know most of the stuff she covers. For me, the book would have been more interesting had it been taken in one of two directions. Either it would have been more enjoyable for me to focus less on the science, and more on the persons involved in the science and the interesting characters she discovers along the way and the anecdotes about them. This is information I don't have, and some of the biographies she uncovers are interesting in their own right - but she doesn't ever go into these people in any great depth, relying instead on deft caricature to set the stage like a comic book artist or a good Game Master. On the other hand, when she delves into the actual science and engineering, I occasionally discovered something I didn't know before, but then all too quickly she was plowing on to some other topic or providing some basic exposition of another fundamental aspect of the science or engineering problem being discussed. As a result, she never actually went into any one subject with the depth I would have liked.And all this time she's trying to be a comedian as well, with varying degree of success. Personally, as a near autistic, many of her wry asides just struck me as being mean spirited. She had enough empathy for her audience that I didn't feel like she was treating the reader to a tour through a carnival freak show - ""Come see the geeks"" - but at times I did feel like she felt her desired audience wouldn't understand her empathy, and she still needed to convince them that she wasn't one of the nerds and that she certainly didn't approve of this whole military thing so that she'll still get invited to parties with the right sort of people in SF. That is to say, some of the humor seemed a bit jarring and out of place, like she was two people - one admiring interviewer and the other hidden one that was laughing at who she was interviewing -and she was better when her asides and jokes were humble.In short, I'm convinced that for the right sort of person who has never even thought of these sort of things, and who enjoys science even if they don't practice it themselves, or has a narrow field of view and hasn't looked much at the big picture this is a five star book. Mrs. Roach has in effect here done admirable journalism and investigation, and turned obscure but important areas of endeavor into a readable funny work suitable for wide consumption. Despite the three stars, I strongly recommend this book to anyone who doesn't have any interest in the military, or whose interest in either science or the military has been at most casual."
87,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/136066-casey,4,"It's best to approach most Mary Roach books as collections of essays based on a common topic. This isn't my first rodeo with her (can you write about rodeos next, Mary? I won't take a fee for that suggestion), so I knew this would be all over the place. However, I didn't predict just how expansive a topic military science would be. While I anticipated chapters on topics like sleep deprivation, I can honestly say that I knew nothing of penile reconstruction before this. Now I (and whoever read over my shoulder on the subway) know a whole lot! Seriously fascinating stuff, as always."

If you would have asked me to read a book about the military and war, I probably would have said no thanks. However, Roach makes you want to read about the topic.

I am amazed at some things discussed in this book I never would have thought of were necessary but save soldiers' lives everyday. Super cool, love it, can't wait to pick up another of her books!"
92,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4272284-kristina,4,"Mary Roach makes science fun. I mean, I think science is fun anyway, but she makes it accessible for non-scientists and she makes it practical. Grunt: The Curious Science of Humans At War is her latest book and I enjoyed it very much. Once again, she tackles scientific topics no one else would think to address and she does it with curiosity, respect, humor and enthusiasm. Grunt explores the science of war and the problems soldiers must deal with (other than the reality of being shot or blown up). After reading these chapters, you realize how much we truly owe our soldiers.I never ever would have thought about military uniforms. Never in a million years. But here’s Roach with a whole chapter about this very topic. Apparently, the fabric of a uniform can affect a soldier’s ability to fight well. That seems like common sense now, but who thinks about this stuff? This is what a modern uniform must do (or come as close as possible): If possible, the army would like to dress its men and women in uniforms that protect them against all that modern warfare has to throw at them: flames, explosives, bullets, lasers, bomb-blasted dirt, blister agents, anthrax, sand fleas. They would like these same uniforms to keep soldiers cool and dry in extreme heat, to stand up to the ruthless rigors of the Army field laundry, to feel good against the skin, to look smart, and to come in under budget. It might be easier to resolve the conflicts in the Middle East (21).She should have added that they be quiet—zippers and buttons and velcro can be noisy and noise can give away a soldier’s position. Extensive testing of fabrics and designs goes on at the US Army Natick Soldier Research, Development and Engineering Center. It’s extremely involved and high-tech. From equipping soldiers with the appropriate clothes to putting them in vehicles that will shield them as much as possible from explosions and gunfire, Roach moves her focus to the human body itself and how the military tries to repair war injuries. Roach being Roach, she doesn’t discuss the usual prosthetics. Why should she? It’s a well-researched topic. No, Mary explores what happens when men have groin damage and their genitals have to be reconstructed. Penis transplants are also now possible. Roach witnessed the procedure (done on cadavers only) and said that by the time the book is published, the first ever penis transplant may have occurred. This chapter was kind of gross, but also very interesting. Roach discusses the possible psychological problems these transplants may cause.The problems of diarrhea, the helpfulness of maggots, and the strain of heat exhaustion are all topics covered in more detail than you may care for, but that’s Mary Roach—she doesn’t leave anything out. The chapters dealing with life in submarines was the most interesting for me, probably due to the lasting impressions the movie The Abyss had on me. I first saw that movie years ago and to do this day I’ve been fascinated with the idea of submarines and the perils of underwater living. It’s also a kick ass movie and I highly recommend it; it vividly shows the consequences of sea water pressure on mechanical objects. Mary Roach is a delight. Her self-deprecating humor and willingness to be a human guinea pig whenever asked (seriously, read her book Bonk. She does not embarrass easily) makes her science books fun to read. She asks the questions you would be reluctant to ask (even if it occurred to you to ask them) and she enthusiastically pursues the answers. If you’re interested in science, read her books. Even if you’re not interested, read her books. I think Mary Roach’s books should be read by high school students so they can understand that science has very real and practical uses. Plus, they will realize that it’s fun."
93,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4361541-barb-middleton,4,"Every time I sit down to write this review, I struggle with the right words and can't help but feel like a ""goober"" myself. Journalist Mary Roach has a terrific voice that makes this science piece easy-to-read and while I laughed, for the most part, there were other times when it was too much. I am glad I read it after, ""The Pentagon's Brain: An Uncensored History of DARPA, America's Top-Secret Military Research Agency"" by Annie Jacobsen because it gave me some historical context that is lacking in Roach's book. Roach is upfront about not specializing in history or science, ""I'm the goober with the flashlight, stumbling into corners and crannies..."" Parts of her story were interesting, others not, and the end definitely abrupt; however, I appreciate the attempt to create characters that are easily visualized. Although even that got repetitive at times. The book doesn't quite nail it, but it is worth reading if you want to know about the side of the military that gets little press such as fabric design for combat, blast wounds, medic training, hearing loss, types of repellents, phalloplasty, and diarrhea to name a few. Her self-deprecating humor and figurative language add to the light tone and great voice. She pokes fun at her lack of knowledge throughout such as thinking that a mechanic's tattoo of pistons are martial arts weapons because of his fierce appearance. On a ship, she makes the mistake of identifying rifle holders as cup holders. She creates characters through detailed descriptions that I liked but became somewhat repetitious, particularly at the start. It seemed most people were gorgeous, adorable, or muscular: ""She is gorgeous, articulate, fast-moving, powerful. Lesser humans left blinking in her wake"" or ""...with a superhero jaw and muscles so big that when he walks in front of the slide projector, entire images can be viewed on his forearm"" or "" you wouldn't use the word distinguished but adorable."" Another officer is ""droll"" and ""adorable"". Even the maggots are ""adorable"" as ""they move like inchworms, like something you might see humping along the pages of a children's book."" That image gave me pause. Here's another one, ""His incisors touch down on his lower lip like children jumping on a bed."" No adorable, but an interesting simile. A fun made-up word is, ""The whole business is straight off my fathometer."" Sometimes she kapow's the reader with phrases that hide her lack of depth on a topic. Other times the book has a seriousness and poignancy that is insightful. She admires the bonding of soldiers and selflessness that defies reason. A man that lost both legs was more concerned about his fellow soldiers being okay than the fact he'd just stepped on an IED. Or how another soldier lost his limbs but said the worst part was losing his hearing because it made it so difficult to communicate with his wife and children. Or the part about how much the government spent millions on shark repellent based on one man's experience and another's political connections. She nails it sometimes and misses the mark at others. And the chapters are connected in a loose manner. As a journalism major, I enjoyed and admired how Mary Roach wrote this piece. She tackles many different topics and perhaps this is the downfall. It might have been better if she had focused on fewer. If you are looking for something historical or scientific then you might want to pair this with another book. "
94,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1345046-todd-martin,3,"Grunt is Mary Roach’s latest book in which she examines technologies associated with  The Curious Science of Humans at War. Well, not really ‘war’ per se, her approach is to focus on technologies involved in keeping soldiers alive and comfortable while minimizing any discussion of weapons, killing or the subject of war itself. This is rather a fine line to tread since the purpose of keeping soldiers alive and comfortable is so that they can do their job (which often involves the use of lethal weapons to end human life), but Roach is known for writing about quirky science topics in an off-beat and humorous way, and the act of creating a fist sized-hole in a human body with a high velocity rifle round isn’t a subject that naturally lends itself to hilarity. Roach is also flirting with a topic fraught with controversy (the bloated US military budget, politicians pork barrel spending, US foreign policy, the national debt, unilateralism, torture, wars of choice, terrorism, drone strikes, civilian casualties, friendly fire, war crimes, the military industrial complex, the treatment of veterans, suicide rates, the conflict in the Middle East and on and on). Her approach is to desperately seek subjects that provide a safe haven so as to avoid any possibly of providing offense (while still managing to work excrement and genitalia into the conversation … obviously). Thus she has chosen to discuss such minutia as: the fabrics and fasteners used in military garments, vehicle armor, hearing protection, penis reconstruction surgery, dysentery remedies, heat exhaustion, sleep deprivation, and others. It’s not that these topics are unimportant (the clothes worn by a soldier while patrolling in a brutally hot desert environment certainly play a role in their comfort, safety and effectiveness), but by focusing on individuals who sweat the small stuff, she’s making a conscious decision to willfully ignore the big stuff. I'll also point out that, other than her coverage of submarine rescues, the remaining topics apply just as much to civilians as they do to the military. Roach is also extremely careful in her use of humor in the book, restricting it mainly to that of self-deprecation. A typical example follows the formula:Roach: Oh look, these uniforms have such cute pockets. They’d be perfect for carrying accessories like my bedazzler or a fresh banana. Military Personnel: That’s magazine holster for an M16A2 assault rifle ma’am.{Cue the trombone}: Wah - wah - waaaah.Given the carefully contrived scope of the book, I would characterize the restricted list of topics discussed as modestly interesting. But after having read most of Roach’s other work I feel like her ‘unflinching glimpse into salacious topics’ style has crossed over into the realm of self-parody. Enough already with the preternatural preoccupation with pee-pee, ca-ca, and the orifices from which these substances emerge."
95,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51152697-kate,4,"This is a book about military science: the study of those things that might affect personnel in combat.he author has a reasonable sense of humor which is much like the military and black humor I am used too. In several places I laughed out loud, as when someone heard a rumor that red fabric had cooling properties. The Army decide to test this in the Philippines and had red under ware designed and ordered and red hat liners...they were anything but cool and the men sweated in places no one wants to sweat, and the red dye ran when wet down into the men's nether parts staining them much to the humor of the control group who wore white under garments. This was 1908 and the services were still on a learning curve.It covers everthing from uniform design, specifications for buttons, why zippers don't work special needs of snipers in gear requirements. How cloth is selected and engineered to wick moisture, retain body heat or allow cooling in hot desert climates. Uniform design: although it didn't mention helmet design which I have been told has been responsible for some of the serious facial burns in IE explosions. The research on the amount of water needed in desert conditions when soldiers burdened with a hundred ponds of gear, armour, supplies and munitions have to expend energy in day time heat of 120-135o. It also covers how the body beaks down when too much water is consumed.Of course it addresses the gigantic toll of intestinal distress from contaminated food, flies and sand tics, and the research that was started during the Spanish American war up to present.Studies and testing to properly armour up vehicles, how to protect bodies within vehicles from the tremendous bone shattering concussions. Much other research is cover in sections, how to prepare Medics to cope with the carnage of the injuries caused by modern weapons.Very interesting book, having family members that have worked in procurement, a son who was a Medical Officer in serving in theater I was familiar with some of the things covered, and the complaints of those who did not want one more piece of protective gear to weight them down or obstruct their movement. A good read for anyone not familiar with what many of the military research teams deal with."
96,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1462387-karyl,5,"Mary Roach is like that little precocious kid that always asks, ""But WHY?!"" I don't think she ever grew out of that stage, and that is lucky for us. She has so many questions to satisfy her curiosity about literally everything, and it's that which fuels her books. I knew I was going to enjoy this book, simply because she wrote it, but it's even more amusing yet fascinating than even I had imagined!I'm glad that Mary Roach didn't go into the normal things you think of when you think of war -- things like guns, or bombs, or IEDs. Instead we look at the fabrics the military uses in its uniforms (I am rather glad I was ignorant of how easily flame retardancy washes out of fabric after my husband finished out all his years at sea, since his favorite coveralls were about as old as some of the guys under him), keeping troops safe when driving through dangerous areas (who knew they'd have to completely redesign the crash test dummy for upward impacts?!), hearing loss (something I'm quite familiar with, since my husband spent the last 23 years in the engine room of various warships), what happens when a guy gets shot in the junk, even how to keep troops free of diarrhea in the field. There is so much in this book that the average person just has never thought of in regards to military science, and of course, Roach injects her own brand of humor at just the right times for a little bit of levity. Read this book, even if you have zero interest in military science. It's funny, it's informative, it's just a good read. I found myself reading out whole pages to my husband while we were on a long drive, and now he (almost) wants to read it himself!"
97,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8733987-christina,4,"This was my first experience with Mary Roach. While the topics she chose to research were fascinating, it was her sense of humor and how it blended in to her style of writing, that I could not relate to at the start of the book. I wasn't sure if she was mocking, making light of or was just generally trying to be funny, in regards of the areas she chose to research for this book. For this reason, I spent the first couple of essays a bit pissed off that she could possibly be making light of such a respectful arena. By about the 3rd chapter, I got a feel for her general reverence and then it all just clicked. I'm a believer and I want to get my hands on all that she has to write. Roach has the ability to bring to the light of day, areas of the military that we may never even give a moment of thought about and surely not consider of importance to the bigger picture of soldiers and the theatre of war. So, not only does she look into the nooks and crannies of the American military, she gives credit to ALL of the MEGA-research that goes in to daily operations that one may not even consider. In doing so, Roach helps to bring a shared glory to the Military as a whole, something that I know doesn't happen often enough. I gained a lot of respect for her writing when I made this realization, and I further appreciated the knack she has to make it all so readable. I highly recommend this to any one who has a bit of time to take a little trip through some of the little known and often really weird, areas of military research and operation. "
98,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17379348,4,"This is my first Mary Roach book. I have been meaning to read something of hers for a long time, but when I won an ARC of Grunt, I really had no excuse anymore.So here's the thing. I have a big problem with people who glorify war and who think patriotism excuses despicable acts such as mass murdering. If this book worked for me, it's because it didn't focus on the killing aspect of war, but rather on the surviving. There was no chapter on guns or explosives. In fact, the only weapon mentioned in this book was something called Stench Soup, which was as life-threatening as its name implies.Roach is very funny and relatable, and her curiosity is contagious to the reader. There were certain points in the book when I was not sure what her opinion on war was, or even if she wanted to express one, but that was clarified at the end of the book. Which brings me to my last comment: I really liked the note that the book ended on. I am very particular about endings. Fiction or non-fiction, the way a book ends can make it or break it for me. And by ending, I do not mean the last chapter or even the general resolution. I mean literally the last couple of sentences. Roach, though, wrapped it all up perfectly.To wrap up myself, reading Grunt was an overall very good experience. I laughed, I shuddered, and I learned all kinds of information that I was never meant to know. And when it comes down to it, what more can you ask of a science book?"
99,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2222340-chris,2,"What a disappointment. Grunt it is not. The author's penchant for monosyllabic titles has done her in. Maybe Boom would have been better because this book is not about grunts. The cover has an infantryman with an absurd amount of gear on his back. Yet there is only a page or two about the infantryman and his obscene loads. The subtitle of the book more accurately conveys the substance of this book: the curious science of humans at war. Some areas you would expect some coverage she omitted: woman in combat; NBC defense; biological barrier of flight; vision-we own the night with NVG's and infrared; PTSD; drones and robots; to name a few. What she does cover is two chapters on genital wounds and a long and perhaps irrelevant chapter on stinky things. I enjoyed the chapter on hearing.She was trying to inform and also entertain simultaneously and she didn't pull it off with me. Flippant footnotes in too small a font. Her overly dramatic account of trying to get special operators to talk to her about diarrhea fell flat. This book got rave reviews but it was written by and for the 99 percent of clueless Americans who as the military say ""are at the mall"" while the 1 percent deploy continually in ""endless war."" This book is described as witty, mischievous, fun, and entertaining. Since when has war been that?"
100,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4882193-paul,4,"As with other Mary Roach books I've read, I thoroughly enjoyed this one. And I knew a bit about the subject matter, the military science of keeping soldiers, sailors, and airmen alive, healthy, and at their peak. In my case, it is aviation medicine and physiology. I flew fighters for the USAF, so I know all about altitude chambers, the infamous Nazi experiments of WWII our present-day cold water survival charts are based on, and the improvements we've made over the years in ejection technology. Mary Roach didn't get into the aviation side of military science with this book but she did explore in detail such topics as military clothing, boots, rations, armored vehicle technology, diarrhea and dysentery, the unique injury patterns associated with IEDS and other explosions, submarine escape systems, and sleep management ... critical subjects all, and not often thought of by anyone other than soldiers who have to perform an all kinds of crazy and dangerous environments. Her trademark humor is very much in evidence, and one simply cannot stop turning pages. In case you can't tell, I love Mary Roach and will read anything she writes."
101,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2505581-gary-brecht,3,"A book definitely not for the squeamish, author, Mary Roach, pulls back the curtain to peek at the efforts of our military to protect and patch up our combat soldiers. The reader is given a tour of a wide variety of military units that specialize in such things as testing protective clothing and gear; training submariners to survive a sunken submarine. She introduces us to surgeons who must deal with the physical and psychological consequences of lost limbs. We discover that there is an ongoing analysis of combat deaths where experts examine the remains of fallen soldiers in an effort to learn ways to prevent future lethal incidents. Throughout the book Roach’s dry wit acts as a relief valve for the otherwise serious content. When all is said and done about the heroic efforts of these support units, one still marvels at how cavalierly our leaders commit our youth to war."

One might suspect that this book is about the military in general, or the army in particular. But, really, it is about numerous often overlooked areas of military operations, namely, clothing, vehicle design, genital surgery, staying focused during chaos, diarrhea, bug control, smelliness, sleep deprivation, and more.The author brings out the science behind these topics, and in the process, illuminates many talented, committed, generous, behind the scenes personnel - doctors, scientists, lab workers, staff - who are doing very good work."
103,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8734097-p-d,4,"As always, Roach's books are a delight to read because they ask questions we wouldn't think of asking. When you're told to come up with the main challenges facing a modern soldier, you probably aren't going to name sleep deprivation, diarrhea, or hearing loss right away. She does mention right away that she isn't here to politicize anything, and that she is deliberately not going into PTSD/mental health because there are whole books that do a great job with the topic—but this shouldn't be too surprising as her writing has been consistently quirky, interested in the perspectives without judging them."

But also someone has to work out all the other stuff: what things do people really need to carry? what’s the best way to keep people alive? What makes a weapon ideal?

She took a quite cavalier and breezy approach to the military, improvements in military technology to prevent horrifying death, and military spending. Only the very last sentence of the book addressed this at all. The chapters also seemed less coherent then usual, covering the army, the navy, genital reconstructive surgery, a shark project from the 1940s, among other subjects, and not adding up to a general picture."

I never would have thought I would enjoy a non fiction book about science...let alone one involving the military. But she has this way of making the most complicated subjects approachable, and so, so fascinating. Roach gives readers a glimpse at the science and humanity behind the people who go to war, instead of the war itself. I just love her to pieces. In fact, I may be developing a bit of a nerdy girl crush on her. #noshame."

Mary Roach has a wonderful way of making hard subjects appeal to an average reader and she did this wonderfully in Grunt.

The anecdotes and information are intriguing, but they're brought to us without any meaningful order, quite disjointedly in fact, and they don't add up to any deeper insight about military life or war, which makes them meaningless.

114,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2007216-peter-derk,4,"Great. Like always. Mary Roach, self-described ""goober with a flashlight"" delivers. Some jerkoff in The New Yorker felt like there were too many jokes in this book, or that Roach's formula failed her this time. If you don't already know how I feel about that review (I DID just call the reviewer a jerkoff), then I'll clarify: that person's kind of a jerkoff.Seemed to me they were all put off because it seems like Mary Roach is having a laugh at the expense of soldiers, which A) isn't true and B) means we were cool having a laugh at astronauts and cadavers in Roach's previous books, and those folks are pretty brave, important, and exposed if you ask me.I thought the critique was especially weird because this book, of all of Roach's I read, finished on a very sweet, thoughtful note. Well, I thought the critique was weird until I remember it was a book critic, so the person probably didn't even read the damn thing.And you know what? If you don't see humor in the idea of stink bombs, this clearly isn't the book for you. Nor is this the Earth for you. Because there is A LOT of smelly shit hanging around here, and some of it's pretty comical. "
115,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6085797-elise,4,"In her typical hilarious style, in this book Mary Roach tackles the science of war. Not the science that will kill the most people on the opposing side, but the one that will keep the most people on this side alive. She participates in a training session for medics in the middle of a battlefield, visits a base in Africa and goes around the mess hall asking about diarrhea, visits a submarine carrying nuclear warheads... all with humour and the greatest respect for what she's describing. Always with the funny anecdotes that will make you literally laugh out loud while you're reading.As in the other two books I read by her, I loved the construction of this one, how each chapter neatly segued into the next one. And the conclusion was lovely, the last sentence was perfect."
116,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1205220-matt,3,"I'm the arrogant sort of person who when I rate a book think that there is some objective element to my rating, and that I'm not merely rating how much I personally enjoyed the book, but also on some level how worthy the book is of enjoyment and how much quality was exercised in the crafting of the book from the level of the individual sentence on up to its grand conceptions and story arc. You might say that in rating a book, my expectation is that everyone else will enjoy the book to within +/- a star of what I rated it, depending on how much the material personally appealed to you and how much - for whatever reasons - you were willing to overlook the books evident flaws. Otherwise, if I did not in fact believe this, whatever would be the reason for rating a book, for if my rating was wholly subjective it would do you no good whatsoever. Mary Roach's book ""Grunt: The Curious Science of Humans at War"" and similar books challenge those presumptions somewhat, in that I don't think a simple one dimensional rating system can in this case predict how much the book will be enjoyed. While for me the book was largely, ""Meh"" and parts of it were grating, that's because the book is pitched at a target audience that just falls outside of anything that would be a sweet spot for me.What's Roach is writing is essentially a primer on basic science and engineering, organized around one of the most interesting fields of basic research in the world today - America's high tech war machine. In an academic world too often focused more on publishing results than doing good work, much less doing anything hard and then managing to repeat it, the Defense Department could care less about how much you publish or where you publish, just so long as you give them tangible solutions. It's research wing DARPA is continually at the forefront of progress. Yet for all this, it's also not just interested in fighting the next war, but also the next and the next, and so very interested in the basic research that may lead to great advances way down the line.Roach approaches this material from a welcome angle, of looking at the less glamorous less macho programs that aim not to create better means of killing people, but rather solve other equally important basic problems of being human in a battlefield environment. For most of human history, man versus nature was still more lethal and more important on a battlefield than the other tribe with its weapons trying to kill you. Infection, disease, starvation, and exposure to the environment killed more men on most military campaigns than the battles did. Roach puts a lens on the modern Defense department's continuing research into keeping soldiers physically and mentally fit during the hardships and horrors of war, and she does so with a self-deprecating, rapier wit and an outsider's eye for the unusual, the bizarre, and details others might miss.It could be the making of a book I really enjoy, but the basic problem here is - I already know most of the stuff she covers. For me, the book would have been more interesting had it been taken in one of two directions. Either it would have been more enjoyable for me to focus less on the science, and more on the persons involved in the science and the interesting characters she discovers along the way and the anecdotes about them. This is information I don't have, and some of the biographies she uncovers are interesting in their own right - but she doesn't ever go into these people in any great depth, relying instead on deft caricature to set the stage like a comic book artist or a good Game Master. On the other hand, when she delves into the actual science and engineering, I occasionally discovered something I didn't know before, but then all too quickly she was plowing on to some other topic or providing some basic exposition of another fundamental aspect of the science or engineering problem being discussed. As a result, she never actually went into any one subject with the depth I would have liked.And all this time she's trying to be a comedian as well, with varying degree of success. Personally, as a near autistic, many of her wry asides just struck me as being mean spirited. She had enough empathy for her audience that I didn't feel like she was treating the reader to a tour through a carnival freak show - ""Come see the geeks"" - but at times I did feel like she felt her desired audience wouldn't understand her empathy, and she still needed to convince them that she wasn't one of the nerds and that she certainly didn't approve of this whole military thing so that she'll still get invited to parties with the right sort of people in SF. That is to say, some of the humor seemed a bit jarring and out of place, like she was two people - one admiring interviewer and the other hidden one that was laughing at who she was interviewing -and she was better when her asides and jokes were humble.In short, I'm convinced that for the right sort of person who has never even thought of these sort of things, and who enjoys science even if they don't practice it themselves, or has a narrow field of view and hasn't looked much at the big picture this is a five star book. Mrs. Roach has in effect here done admirable journalism and investigation, and turned obscure but important areas of endeavor into a readable funny work suitable for wide consumption. Despite the three stars, I strongly recommend this book to anyone who doesn't have any interest in the military, or whose interest in either science or the military has been at most casual."
117,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/136066-casey,4,"It's best to approach most Mary Roach books as collections of essays based on a common topic. This isn't my first rodeo with her (can you write about rodeos next, Mary? I won't take a fee for that suggestion), so I knew this would be all over the place. However, I didn't predict just how expansive a topic military science would be. While I anticipated chapters on topics like sleep deprivation, I can honestly say that I knew nothing of penile reconstruction before this. Now I (and whoever read over my shoulder on the subway) know a whole lot! Seriously fascinating stuff, as always."

If you would have asked me to read a book about the military and war, I probably would have said no thanks. However, Roach makes you want to read about the topic. She provides an angle not normally contemplated, but intriguing none the less. "

122,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4272284-kristina,4,"Mary Roach makes science fun. I mean, I think science is fun anyway, but she makes it accessible for non-scientists and she makes it practical. Grunt: The Curious Science of Humans At War is her latest book and I enjoyed it very much. Once again, she tackles scientific topics no one else would think to address and she does it with curiosity, respect, humor and enthusiasm. Grunt explores the science of war and the problems soldiers must deal with (other than the reality of being shot or blown up). After reading these chapters, you realize how much we truly owe our soldiers.I never ever would have thought about military uniforms. Never in a million years. But here’s Roach with a whole chapter about this very topic. Apparently, the fabric of a uniform can affect a soldier’s ability to fight well. That seems like common sense now, but who thinks about this stuff? This is what a modern uniform must do (or come as close as possible): If possible, the army would like to dress its men and women in uniforms that protect them against all that modern warfare has to throw at them: flames, explosives, bullets, lasers, bomb-blasted dirt, blister agents, anthrax, sand fleas. They would like these same uniforms to keep soldiers cool and dry in extreme heat, to stand up to the ruthless rigors of the Army field laundry, to feel good against the skin, to look smart, and to come in under budget. It might be easier to resolve the conflicts in the Middle East (21).She should have added that they be quiet—zippers and buttons and velcro can be noisy and noise can give away a soldier’s position. Extensive testing of fabrics and designs goes on at the US Army Natick Soldier Research, Development and Engineering Center. It’s extremely involved and high-tech. From equipping soldiers with the appropriate clothes to putting them in vehicles that will shield them as much as possible from explosions and gunfire, Roach moves her focus to the human body itself and how the military tries to repair war injuries. Roach being Roach, she doesn’t discuss the usual prosthetics. Why should she? It’s a well-researched topic. No, Mary explores what happens when men have groin damage and their genitals have to be reconstructed. Penis transplants are also now possible. Roach witnessed the procedure (done on cadavers only) and said that by the time the book is published, the first ever penis transplant may have occurred. This chapter was kind of gross, but also very interesting. Roach discusses the possible psychological problems these transplants may cause.The problems of diarrhea, the helpfulness of maggots, and the strain of heat exhaustion are all topics covered in more detail than you may care for, but that’s Mary Roach—she doesn’t leave anything out. The chapters dealing with life in submarines was the most interesting for me, probably due to the lasting impressions the movie The Abyss had on me. I first saw that movie years ago and to do this day I’ve been fascinated with the idea of submarines and the perils of underwater living. It’s also a kick ass movie and I highly recommend it; it vividly shows the consequences of sea water pressure on mechanical objects. Mary Roach is a delight. Her self-deprecating humor and willingness to be a human guinea pig whenever asked (seriously, read her book Bonk. She does not embarrass easily) makes her science books fun to read. She asks the questions you would be reluctant to ask (even if it occurred to you to ask them) and she enthusiastically pursues the answers. If you’re interested in science, read her books. Even if you’re not interested, read her books. I think Mary Roach’s books should be read by high school students so they can understand that science has very real and practical uses. Plus, they will realize that it’s fun."
123,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4361541-barb-middleton,4,"Every time I sit down to write this review, I struggle with the right words and can't help but feel like a ""goober"" myself. Journalist Mary Roach has a terrific voice that makes this science piece easy-to-read and while I laughed, for the most part, there were other times when it was too much. I am glad I read it after, ""The Pentagon's Brain: An Uncensored History of DARPA, America's Top-Secret Military Research Agency"" by Annie Jacobsen because it gave me some historical context that is lacking in Roach's book. Roach is upfront about not specializing in history or science, ""I'm the goober with the flashlight, stumbling into corners and crannies..."" Parts of her story were interesting, others not, and the end definitely abrupt; however, I appreciate the attempt to create characters that are easily visualized. Although even that got repetitive at times. The book doesn't quite nail it, but it is worth reading if you want to know about the side of the military that gets little press such as fabric design for combat, blast wounds, medic training, hearing loss, types of repellents, phalloplasty, and diarrhea to name a few. Her self-deprecating humor and figurative language add to the light tone and great voice. She pokes fun at her lack of knowledge throughout such as thinking that a mechanic's tattoo of pistons are martial arts weapons because of his fierce appearance. On a ship, she makes the mistake of identifying rifle holders as cup holders. She creates characters through detailed descriptions that I liked but became somewhat repetitious, particularly at the start. It seemed most people were gorgeous, adorable, or muscular: ""She is gorgeous, articulate, fast-moving, powerful. Lesser humans left blinking in her wake"" or ""...with a superhero jaw and muscles so big that when he walks in front of the slide projector, entire images can be viewed on his forearm"" or "" you wouldn't use the word distinguished but adorable."" Another officer is ""droll"" and ""adorable"". Even the maggots are ""adorable"" as ""they move like inchworms, like something you might see humping along the pages of a children's book."" That image gave me pause. Here's another one, ""His incisors touch down on his lower lip like children jumping on a bed."" No adorable, but an interesting simile. A fun made-up word is, ""The whole business is straight off my fathometer."" Sometimes she kapow's the reader with phrases that hide her lack of depth on a topic. Other times the book has a seriousness and poignancy that is insightful. She admires the bonding of soldiers and selflessness that defies reason. A man that lost both legs was more concerned about his fellow soldiers being okay than the fact he'd just stepped on an IED. Or how another soldier lost his limbs but said the worst part was losing his hearing because it made it so difficult to communicate with his wife and children. Or the part about how much the government spent millions on shark repellent based on one man's experience and another's political connections. She nails it sometimes and misses the mark at others. And the chapters are connected in a loose manner. As a journalism major, I enjoyed and admired how Mary Roach wrote this piece. She tackles many different topics and perhaps this is the downfall. It might have been better if she had focused on fewer. If you are looking for something historical or scientific then you might want to pair this with another book. "
124,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1345046-todd-martin,3,"Grunt is Mary Roach’s latest book in which she examines technologies associated with  The Curious Science of Humans at War. Well, not really ‘war’ per se, her approach is to focus on technologies involved in keeping soldiers alive and comfortable while minimizing any discussion of weapons, killing or the subject of war itself. This is rather a fine line to tread since the purpose of keeping soldiers alive and comfortable is so that they can do their job (which often involves the use of lethal weapons to end human life), but Roach is known for writing about quirky science topics in an off-beat and humorous way, and the act of creating a fist sized-hole in a human body with a high velocity rifle round isn’t a subject that naturally lends itself to hilarity. Roach is also flirting with a topic fraught with controversy (the bloated US military budget, politicians pork barrel spending, US foreign policy, the national debt, unilateralism, torture, wars of choice, terrorism, drone strikes, civilian casualties, friendly fire, war crimes, the military industrial complex, the treatment of veterans, suicide rates, the conflict in the Middle East and on and on). Her approach is to desperately seek subjects that provide a safe haven so as to avoid any possibly of providing offense (while still managing to work excrement and genitalia into the conversation … obviously). Thus she has chosen to discuss such minutia as: the fabrics and fasteners used in military garments, vehicle armor, hearing protection, penis reconstruction surgery, dysentery remedies, heat exhaustion, sleep deprivation, and others. It’s not that these topics are unimportant (the clothes worn by a soldier while patrolling in a brutally hot desert environment certainly play a role in their comfort, safety and effectiveness), but by focusing on individuals who sweat the small stuff, she’s making a conscious decision to willfully ignore the big stuff. I'll also point out that, other than her coverage of submarine rescues, the remaining topics apply just as much to civilians as they do to the military. Roach is also extremely careful in her use of humor in the book, restricting it mainly to that of self-deprecation. A typical example follows the formula:Roach: Oh look, these uniforms have such cute pockets. They’d be perfect for carrying accessories like my bedazzler or a fresh banana. Military Personnel: That’s magazine holster for an M16A2 assault rifle ma’am.{Cue the trombone}: Wah - wah - waaaah.Given the carefully contrived scope of the book, I would characterize the restricted list of topics discussed as modestly interesting. But after having read most of Roach’s other work I feel like her ‘unflinching glimpse into salacious topics’ style has crossed over into the realm of self-parody. Enough already with the preternatural preoccupation with pee-pee, ca-ca, and the orifices from which these substances emerge."
125,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51152697-kate,4,"This is a book about military science: the study of those things that might affect personnel in combat.he author has a reasonable sense of humor which is much like the military and black humor I am used too. In several places I laughed out loud, as when someone heard a rumor that red fabric had cooling properties. The Army decide to test this in the Philippines and had red under ware designed and ordered and red hat liners...they were anything but cool and the men sweated in places no one wants to sweat, and the red dye ran when wet down into the men's nether parts staining them much to the humor of the control group who wore white under garments. This was 1908 and the services were still on a learning curve.It covers everthing from uniform design, specifications for buttons, why zippers don't work special needs of snipers in gear requirements. How cloth is selected and engineered to wick moisture, retain body heat or allow cooling in hot desert climates. Uniform design: although it didn't mention helmet design which I have been told has been responsible for some of the serious facial burns in IE explosions. The research on the amount of water needed in desert conditions when soldiers burdened with a hundred ponds of gear, armour, supplies and munitions have to expend energy in day time heat of 120-135o. It also covers how the body beaks down when too much water is consumed.Of course it addresses the gigantic toll of intestinal distress from contaminated food, flies and sand tics, and the research that was started during the Spanish American war up to present.Studies and testing to properly armour up vehicles, how to protect bodies within vehicles from the tremendous bone shattering concussions. Much other research is cover in sections, how to prepare Medics to cope with the carnage of the injuries caused by modern weapons.Very interesting book, having family members that have worked in procurement, a son who was a Medical Officer in serving in theater I was familiar with some of the things covered, and the complaints of those who did not want one more piece of protective gear to weight them down or obstruct their movement. A good read for anyone not familiar with what many of the military research teams deal with."
126,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1462387-karyl,5,"Mary Roach is like that little precocious kid that always asks, ""But WHY?!"" I don't think she ever grew out of that stage, and that is lucky for us. She has so many questions to satisfy her curiosity about literally everything, and it's that which fuels her books. I knew I was going to enjoy this book, simply because she wrote it, but it's even more amusing yet fascinating than even I had imagined!I'm glad that Mary Roach didn't go into the normal things you think of when you think of war -- things like guns, or bombs, or IEDs. Instead we look at the fabrics the military uses in its uniforms (I am rather glad I was ignorant of how easily flame retardancy washes out of fabric after my husband finished out all his years at sea, since his favorite coveralls were about as old as some of the guys under him), keeping troops safe when driving through dangerous areas (who knew they'd have to completely redesign the crash test dummy for upward impacts?!), hearing loss (something I'm quite familiar with, since my husband spent the last 23 years in the engine room of various warships), what happens when a guy gets shot in the junk, even how to keep troops free of diarrhea in the field. There is so much in this book that the average person just has never thought of in regards to military science, and of course, Roach injects her own brand of humor at just the right times for a little bit of levity. Read this book, even if you have zero interest in military science. It's funny, it's informative, it's just a good read. I found myself reading out whole pages to my husband while we were on a long drive, and now he (almost) wants to read it himself!"
127,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8733987-christina,4,"This was my first experience with Mary Roach. While the topics she chose to research were fascinating, it was her sense of humor and how it blended in to her style of writing, that I could not relate to at the start of the book. I wasn't sure if she was mocking, making light of or was just generally trying to be funny, in regards of the areas she chose to research for this book. For this reason, I spent the first couple of essays a bit pissed off that she could possibly be making light of such a respectful arena. By about the 3rd chapter, I got a feel for her general reverence and then it all just clicked. I'm a believer and I want to get my hands on all that she has to write. Roach has the ability to bring to the light of day, areas of the military that we may never even give a moment of thought about and surely not consider of importance to the bigger picture of soldiers and the theatre of war. So, not only does she look into the nooks and crannies of the American military, she gives credit to ALL of the MEGA-research that goes in to daily operations that one may not even consider. In doing so, Roach helps to bring a shared glory to the Military as a whole, something that I know doesn't happen often enough. I gained a lot of respect for her writing when I made this realization, and I further appreciated the knack she has to make it all so readable. I highly recommend this to any one who has a bit of time to take a little trip through some of the little known and often really weird, areas of military research and operation. "
128,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17379348,4,"This is my first Mary Roach book. I have been meaning to read something of hers for a long time, but when I won an ARC of Grunt, I really had no excuse anymore.So here's the thing. I have a big problem with people who glorify war and who think patriotism excuses despicable acts such as mass murdering. If this book worked for me, it's because it didn't focus on the killing aspect of war, but rather on the surviving. There was no chapter on guns or explosives. In fact, the only weapon mentioned in this book was something called Stench Soup, which was as life-threatening as its name implies.Roach is very funny and relatable, and her curiosity is contagious to the reader. There were certain points in the book when I was not sure what her opinion on war was, or even if she wanted to express one, but that was clarified at the end of the book. Which brings me to my last comment: I really liked the note that the book ended on. I am very particular about endings. Fiction or non-fiction, the way a book ends can make it or break it for me. And by ending, I do not mean the last chapter or even the general resolution. I mean literally the last couple of sentences. Roach, though, wrapped it all up perfectly.To wrap up myself, reading Grunt was an overall very good experience. I laughed, I shuddered, and I learned all kinds of information that I was never meant to know. And when it comes down to it, what more can you ask of a science book?"
129,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2222340-chris,2,"What a disappointment. Grunt it is not. The author's penchant for monosyllabic titles has done her in. Maybe Boom would have been better because this book is not about grunts. The cover has an infantryman with an absurd amount of gear on his back. Yet there is only a page or two about the infantryman and his obscene loads. The subtitle of the book more accurately conveys the substance of this book: the curious science of humans at war. Some areas you would expect some coverage she omitted: woman in combat; NBC defense; biological barrier of flight; vision-we own the night with NVG's and infrared; PTSD; drones and robots; to name a few. What she does cover is two chapters on genital wounds and a long and perhaps irrelevant chapter on stinky things. I enjoyed the chapter on hearing.She was trying to inform and also entertain simultaneously and she didn't pull it off with me. Flippant footnotes in too small a font. Her overly dramatic account of trying to get special operators to talk to her about diarrhea fell flat. This book got rave reviews but it was written by and for the 99 percent of clueless Americans who as the military say ""are at the mall"" while the 1 percent deploy continually in ""endless war."" This book is described as witty, mischievous, fun, and entertaining. Since when has war been that?"
130,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4882193-paul,4,"As with other Mary Roach books I've read, I thoroughly enjoyed this one. And I knew a bit about the subject matter, the military science of keeping soldiers, sailors, and airmen alive, healthy, and at their peak. In my case, it is aviation medicine and physiology. I flew fighters for the USAF, so I know all about altitude chambers, the infamous Nazi experiments of WWII our present-day cold water survival charts are based on, and the improvements we've made over the years in ejection technology. Mary Roach didn't get into the aviation side of military science with this book but she did explore in detail such topics as military clothing, boots, rations, armored vehicle technology, diarrhea and dysentery, the unique injury patterns associated with IEDS and other explosions, submarine escape systems, and sleep management ... critical subjects all, and not often thought of by anyone other than soldiers who have to perform an all kinds of crazy and dangerous environments. Her trademark humor is very much in evidence, and one simply cannot stop turning pages. In case you can't tell, I love Mary Roach and will read anything she writes."

The reader is given a tour of a wide variety of military units that specialize in such things as testing protective clothing and gear; training submariners to survive a sunken submarine. She introduces us to surgeons who must deal with the physical and psychological consequences of lost limbs. We discover that there is an ongoing analysis of combat deaths where experts examine the remains of fallen soldiers in an effort to learn ways to prevent future lethal incidents. Throughout the book Roach’s dry wit acts as a relief valve for the otherwise serious content. When all is said and done about the heroic efforts of these support units, one still marvels at how cavalierly our leaders commit our youth to war."

One might suspect that this book is about the military in general, or the army in particular. But, really, it is about numerous often overlooked areas of military operations, namely, clothing, vehicle design, genital surgery, staying focused during chaos, diarrhea, bug control, smelliness, sleep deprivation, and more.The author brings out the science behind these topics, and in the process, illuminates many talented, committed, generous, behind the scenes personnel - doctors, scientists, lab workers, staff - who are doing very good work."

When you're told to come up with the main challenges facing a modern soldier, you probably aren't going to name sleep deprivation, diarrhea, or hearing loss right away. She does mention right away that she isn't here to politicize anything, and that she is deliberately not going into PTSD/mental health because there are whole books that do a great job with the topic—but this shouldn't be too surprising as her writing has been consistently quirky, interested in the perspectives without judging them."

She took a quite cavalier and breezy approach to the military, improvements in military technology to prevent horrifying death, and military spending. Only the very last sentence of the book addressed this at all. The chapters also seemed less coherent then usual, covering the army, the navy, genital reconstructive surgery, a shark project from the 1940s, among other subjects, and not adding up to a general picture."

I never would have thought I would enjoy a non fiction book about science...let alone one involving the military. But she has this way of making the most complicated subjects approachable, and so, so fascinating. Roach gives readers a glimpse at the science and humanity behind the people who go to war, instead of the war itself. I just love her to pieces.

Some jerkoff in The New Yorker felt like there were too many jokes in this book, or that Roach's formula failed her this time. If you don't already know how I feel about that review (I DID just call the reviewer a jerkoff), then I'll clarify: that person's kind of a jerkoff.Seemed to me they were all put off because it seems like Mary Roach is having a laugh at the expense of soldiers, which A) isn't true and B) means we were cool having a laugh at astronauts and cadavers in Roach's previous books, and those folks are pretty brave, important, and exposed if you ask me.I thought the critique was especially weird because this book, of all of Roach's I read, finished on a very sweet, thoughtful note. Well, I thought the critique was weird until I remember it was a book critic, so the person probably didn't even read the damn thing.And you know what? If you don't see humor in the idea of stink bombs, this clearly isn't the book for you. Nor is this the Earth for you. Because there is A LOT of smelly shit hanging around here, and some of it's pretty comical. "
145,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6085797-elise,4,"In her typical hilarious style, in this book Mary Roach tackles the science of war. Not the science that will kill the most people on the opposing side, but the one that will keep the most people on this side alive. She participates in a training session for medics in the middle of a battlefield, visits a base in Africa and goes around the mess hall asking about diarrhea, visits a submarine carrying nuclear warheads... all with humour and the greatest respect for what she's describing. Always with the funny anecdotes that will make you literally laugh out loud while you're reading.As in the other two books I read by her, I loved the construction of this one, how each chapter neatly segued into the next one. And the conclusion was lovely, the last sentence was perfect."
146,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1205220-matt,3,"I'm the arrogant sort of person who when I rate a book think that there is some objective element to my rating, and that I'm not merely rating how much I personally enjoyed the book, but also on some level how worthy the book is of enjoyment and how much quality was exercised in the crafting of the book from the level of the individual sentence on up to its grand conceptions and story arc. You might say that in rating a book, my expectation is that everyone else will enjoy the book to within +/- a star of what I rated it, depending on how much the material personally appealed to you and how much - for whatever reasons - you were willing to overlook the books evident flaws. Otherwise, if I did not in fact believe this, whatever would be the reason for rating a book, for if my rating was wholly subjective it would do you no good whatsoever. Mary Roach's book ""Grunt: The Curious Science of Humans at War"" and similar books challenge those presumptions somewhat, in that I don't think a simple one dimensional rating system can in this case predict how much the book will be enjoyed. While for me the book was largely, ""Meh"" and parts of it were grating, that's because the book is pitched at a target audience that just falls outside of anything that would be a sweet spot for me.What's Roach is writing is essentially a primer on basic science and engineering, organized around one of the most interesting fields of basic research in the world today - America's high tech war machine. In an academic world too often focused more on publishing results than doing good work, much less doing anything hard and then managing to repeat it, the Defense Department could care less about how much you publish or where you publish, just so long as you give them tangible solutions. It's research wing DARPA is continually at the forefront of progress. Yet for all this, it's also not just interested in fighting the next war, but also the next and the next, and so very interested in the basic research that may lead to great advances way down the line.Roach approaches this material from a welcome angle, of looking at the less glamorous less macho programs that aim not to create better means of killing people, but rather solve other equally important basic problems of being human in a battlefield environment. For most of human history, man versus nature was still more lethal and more important on a battlefield than the other tribe with its weapons trying to kill you. Infection, disease, starvation, and exposure to the environment killed more men on most military campaigns than the battles did. Roach puts a lens on the modern Defense department's continuing research into keeping soldiers physically and mentally fit during the hardships and horrors of war, and she does so with a self-deprecating, rapier wit and an outsider's eye for the unusual, the bizarre, and details others might miss.It could be the making of a book I really enjoy, but the basic problem here is - I already know most of the stuff she covers. For me, the book would have been more interesting had it been taken in one of two directions. Either it would have been more enjoyable for me to focus less on the science, and more on the persons involved in the science and the interesting characters she discovers along the way and the anecdotes about them. This is information I don't have, and some of the biographies she uncovers are interesting in their own right - but she doesn't ever go into these people in any great depth, relying instead on deft caricature to set the stage like a comic book artist or a good Game Master. On the other hand, when she delves into the actual science and engineering, I occasionally discovered something I didn't know before, but then all too quickly she was plowing on to some other topic or providing some basic exposition of another fundamental aspect of the science or engineering problem being discussed. As a result, she never actually went into any one subject with the depth I would have liked.And all this time she's trying to be a comedian as well, with varying degree of success. Personally, as a near autistic, many of her wry asides just struck me as being mean spirited. She had enough empathy for her audience that I didn't feel like she was treating the reader to a tour through a carnival freak show - ""Come see the geeks"" - but at times I did feel like she felt her desired audience wouldn't understand her empathy, and she still needed to convince them that she wasn't one of the nerds and that she certainly didn't approve of this whole military thing so that she'll still get invited to parties with the right sort of people in SF. That is to say, some of the humor seemed a bit jarring and out of place, like she was two people - one admiring interviewer and the other hidden one that was laughing at who she was interviewing -and she was better when her asides and jokes were humble.In short, I'm convinced that for the right sort of person who has never even thought of these sort of things, and who enjoys science even if they don't practice it themselves, or has a narrow field of view and hasn't looked much at the big picture this is a five star book. Mrs. Roach has in effect here done admirable journalism and investigation, and turned obscure but important areas of endeavor into a readable funny work suitable for wide consumption. Despite the three stars, I strongly recommend this book to anyone who doesn't have any interest in the military, or whose interest in either science or the military has been at most casual."
147,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/136066-casey,4,"It's best to approach most Mary Roach books as collections of essays based on a common topic. This isn't my first rodeo with her (can you write about rodeos next, Mary? I won't take a fee for that suggestion), so I knew this would be all over the place. However, I didn't predict just how expansive a topic military science would be. While I anticipated chapters on topics like sleep deprivation, I can honestly say that I knew nothing of penile reconstruction before this. Now I (and whoever read over my shoulder on the subway) know a whole lot! Seriously fascinating stuff, as always."

152,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4272284-kristina,4,"Mary Roach makes science fun. I mean, I think science is fun anyway, but she makes it accessible for non-scientists and she makes it practical. Grunt: The Curious Science of Humans At War is her latest book and I enjoyed it very much. Once again, she tackles scientific topics no one else would think to address and she does it with curiosity, respect, humor and enthusiasm. Grunt explores the science of war and the problems soldiers must deal with (other than the reality of being shot or blown up). After reading these chapters, you realize how much we truly owe our soldiers.I never ever would have thought about military uniforms. Never in a million years. But here’s Roach with a whole chapter about this very topic. Apparently, the fabric of a uniform can affect a soldier’s ability to fight well. That seems like common sense now, but who thinks about this stuff? This is what a modern uniform must do (or come as close as possible): If possible, the army would like to dress its men and women in uniforms that protect them against all that modern warfare has to throw at them: flames, explosives, bullets, lasers, bomb-blasted dirt, blister agents, anthrax, sand fleas. They would like these same uniforms to keep soldiers cool and dry in extreme heat, to stand up to the ruthless rigors of the Army field laundry, to feel good against the skin, to look smart, and to come in under budget. It might be easier to resolve the conflicts in the Middle East (21).She should have added that they be quiet—zippers and buttons and velcro can be noisy and noise can give away a soldier’s position. Extensive testing of fabrics and designs goes on at the US Army Natick Soldier Research, Development and Engineering Center. It’s extremely involved and high-tech. From equipping soldiers with the appropriate clothes to putting them in vehicles that will shield them as much as possible from explosions and gunfire, Roach moves her focus to the human body itself and how the military tries to repair war injuries. Roach being Roach, she doesn’t discuss the usual prosthetics. Why should she? It’s a well-researched topic. No, Mary explores what happens when men have groin damage and their genitals have to be reconstructed. Penis transplants are also now possible. Roach witnessed the procedure (done on cadavers only) and said that by the time the book is published, the first ever penis transplant may have occurred. This chapter was kind of gross, but also very interesting. Roach discusses the possible psychological problems these transplants may cause.The problems of diarrhea, the helpfulness of maggots, and the strain of heat exhaustion are all topics covered in more detail than you may care for, but that’s Mary Roach—she doesn’t leave anything out. The chapters dealing with life in submarines was the most interesting for me, probably due to the lasting impressions the movie The Abyss had on me. I first saw that movie years ago and to do this day I’ve been fascinated with the idea of submarines and the perils of underwater living. It’s also a kick ass movie and I highly recommend it; it vividly shows the consequences of sea water pressure on mechanical objects. Mary Roach is a delight. Her self-deprecating humor and willingness to be a human guinea pig whenever asked (seriously, read her book Bonk. She does not embarrass easily) makes her science books fun to read. She asks the questions you would be reluctant to ask (even if it occurred to you to ask them) and she enthusiastically pursues the answers. If you’re interested in science, read her books. Even if you’re not interested, read her books. I think Mary Roach’s books should be read by high school students so they can understand that science has very real and practical uses. Plus, they will realize that it’s fun."
153,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4361541-barb-middleton,4,"Every time I sit down to write this review, I struggle with the right words and can't help but feel like a ""goober"" myself. Journalist Mary Roach has a terrific voice that makes this science piece easy-to-read and while I laughed, for the most part, there were other times when it was too much. I am glad I read it after, ""The Pentagon's Brain: An Uncensored History of DARPA, America's Top-Secret Military Research Agency"" by Annie Jacobsen because it gave me some historical context that is lacking in Roach's book. Roach is upfront about not specializing in history or science, ""I'm the goober with the flashlight, stumbling into corners and crannies..."" Parts of her story were interesting, others not, and the end definitely abrupt; however, I appreciate the attempt to create characters that are easily visualized. Although even that got repetitive at times. The book doesn't quite nail it, but it is worth reading if you want to know about the side of the military that gets little press such as fabric design for combat, blast wounds, medic training, hearing loss, types of repellents, phalloplasty, and diarrhea to name a few. Her self-deprecating humor and figurative language add to the light tone and great voice. She pokes fun at her lack of knowledge throughout such as thinking that a mechanic's tattoo of pistons are martial arts weapons because of his fierce appearance. On a ship, she makes the mistake of identifying rifle holders as cup holders. She creates characters through detailed descriptions that I liked but became somewhat repetitious, particularly at the start. It seemed most people were gorgeous, adorable, or muscular: ""She is gorgeous, articulate, fast-moving, powerful. Lesser humans left blinking in her wake"" or ""...with a superhero jaw and muscles so big that when he walks in front of the slide projector, entire images can be viewed on his forearm"" or "" you wouldn't use the word distinguished but adorable."" Another officer is ""droll"" and ""adorable"". Even the maggots are ""adorable"" as ""they move like inchworms, like something you might see humping along the pages of a children's book."" That image gave me pause. Here's another one, ""His incisors touch down on his lower lip like children jumping on a bed."" No adorable, but an interesting simile. A fun made-up word is, ""The whole business is straight off my fathometer."" Sometimes she kapow's the reader with phrases that hide her lack of depth on a topic. Other times the book has a seriousness and poignancy that is insightful. She admires the bonding of soldiers and selflessness that defies reason. A man that lost both legs was more concerned about his fellow soldiers being okay than the fact he'd just stepped on an IED. Or how another soldier lost his limbs but said the worst part was losing his hearing because it made it so difficult to communicate with his wife and children. Or the part about how much the government spent millions on shark repellent based on one man's experience and another's political connections. She nails it sometimes and misses the mark at others. And the chapters are connected in a loose manner. As a journalism major, I enjoyed and admired how Mary Roach wrote this piece. She tackles many different topics and perhaps this is the downfall. It might have been better if she had focused on fewer. If you are looking for something historical or scientific then you might want to pair this with another book. "
154,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1345046-todd-martin,3,"Grunt is Mary Roach’s latest book in which she examines technologies associated with  The Curious Science of Humans at War. Well, not really ‘war’ per se, her approach is to focus on technologies involved in keeping soldiers alive and comfortable while minimizing any discussion of weapons, killing or the subject of war itself. This is rather a fine line to tread since the purpose of keeping soldiers alive and comfortable is so that they can do their job (which often involves the use of lethal weapons to end human life), but Roach is known for writing about quirky science topics in an off-beat and humorous way, and the act of creating a fist sized-hole in a human body with a high velocity rifle round isn’t a subject that naturally lends itself to hilarity. Roach is also flirting with a topic fraught with controversy (the bloated US military budget, politicians pork barrel spending, US foreign policy, the national debt, unilateralism, torture, wars of choice, terrorism, drone strikes, civilian casualties, friendly fire, war crimes, the military industrial complex, the treatment of veterans, suicide rates, the conflict in the Middle East and on and on). Her approach is to desperately seek subjects that provide a safe haven so as to avoid any possibly of providing offense (while still managing to work excrement and genitalia into the conversation … obviously). Thus she has chosen to discuss such minutia as: the fabrics and fasteners used in military garments, vehicle armor, hearing protection, penis reconstruction surgery, dysentery remedies, heat exhaustion, sleep deprivation, and others. It’s not that these topics are unimportant (the clothes worn by a soldier while patrolling in a brutally hot desert environment certainly play a role in their comfort, safety and effectiveness), but by focusing on individuals who sweat the small stuff, she’s making a conscious decision to willfully ignore the big stuff. I'll also point out that, other than her coverage of submarine rescues, the remaining topics apply just as much to civilians as they do to the military. Roach is also extremely careful in her use of humor in the book, restricting it mainly to that of self-deprecation. A typical example follows the formula:Roach: Oh look, these uniforms have such cute pockets. They’d be perfect for carrying accessories like my bedazzler or a fresh banana. Military Personnel: That’s magazine holster for an M16A2 assault rifle ma’am.{Cue the trombone}: Wah - wah - waaaah.Given the carefully contrived scope of the book, I would characterize the restricted list of topics discussed as modestly interesting. But after having read most of Roach’s other work I feel like her ‘unflinching glimpse into salacious topics’ style has crossed over into the realm of self-parody. Enough already with the preternatural preoccupation with pee-pee, ca-ca, and the orifices from which these substances emerge."
155,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51152697-kate,4,"This is a book about military science: the study of those things that might affect personnel in combat.he author has a reasonable sense of humor which is much like the military and black humor I am used too. In several places I laughed out loud, as when someone heard a rumor that red fabric had cooling properties. The Army decide to test this in the Philippines and had red under ware designed and ordered and red hat liners...they were anything but cool and the men sweated in places no one wants to sweat, and the red dye ran when wet down into the men's nether parts staining them much to the humor of the control group who wore white under garments. This was 1908 and the services were still on a learning curve.It covers everthing from uniform design, specifications for buttons, why zippers don't work special needs of snipers in gear requirements. How cloth is selected and engineered to wick moisture, retain body heat or allow cooling in hot desert climates. Uniform design: although it didn't mention helmet design which I have been told has been responsible for some of the serious facial burns in IE explosions. The research on the amount of water needed in desert conditions when soldiers burdened with a hundred ponds of gear, armour, supplies and munitions have to expend energy in day time heat of 120-135o. It also covers how the body beaks down when too much water is consumed.Of course it addresses the gigantic toll of intestinal distress from contaminated food, flies and sand tics, and the research that was started during the Spanish American war up to present.Studies and testing to properly armour up vehicles, how to protect bodies within vehicles from the tremendous bone shattering concussions. Much other research is cover in sections, how to prepare Medics to cope with the carnage of the injuries caused by modern weapons.Very interesting book, having family members that have worked in procurement, a son who was a Medical Officer in serving in theater I was familiar with some of the things covered, and the complaints of those who did not want one more piece of protective gear to weight them down or obstruct their movement. A good read for anyone not familiar with what many of the military research teams deal with."
156,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1462387-karyl,5,"Mary Roach is like that little precocious kid that always asks, ""But WHY?!"" I don't think she ever grew out of that stage, and that is lucky for us. She has so many questions to satisfy her curiosity about literally everything, and it's that which fuels her books. I knew I was going to enjoy this book, simply because she wrote it, but it's even more amusing yet fascinating than even I had imagined!I'm glad that Mary Roach didn't go into the normal things you think of when you think of war -- things like guns, or bombs, or IEDs. Instead we look at the fabrics the military uses in its uniforms (I am rather glad I was ignorant of how easily flame retardancy washes out of fabric after my husband finished out all his years at sea, since his favorite coveralls were about as old as some of the guys under him), keeping troops safe when driving through dangerous areas (who knew they'd have to completely redesign the crash test dummy for upward impacts?!), hearing loss (something I'm quite familiar with, since my husband spent the last 23 years in the engine room of various warships), what happens when a guy gets shot in the junk, even how to keep troops free of diarrhea in the field. There is so much in this book that the average person just has never thought of in regards to military science, and of course, Roach injects her own brand of humor at just the right times for a little bit of levity. Read this book, even if you have zero interest in military science. It's funny, it's informative, it's just a good read. I found myself reading out whole pages to my husband while we were on a long drive, and now he (almost) wants to read it himself!"
157,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8733987-christina,4,"This was my first experience with Mary Roach. While the topics she chose to research were fascinating, it was her sense of humor and how it blended in to her style of writing, that I could not relate to at the start of the book. I wasn't sure if she was mocking, making light of or was just generally trying to be funny, in regards of the areas she chose to research for this book. For this reason, I spent the first couple of essays a bit pissed off that she could possibly be making light of such a respectful arena. By about the 3rd chapter, I got a feel for her general reverence and then it all just clicked. I'm a believer and I want to get my hands on all that she has to write. Roach has the ability to bring to the light of day, areas of the military that we may never even give a moment of thought about and surely not consider of importance to the bigger picture of soldiers and the theatre of war. So, not only does she look into the nooks and crannies of the American military, she gives credit to ALL of the MEGA-research that goes in to daily operations that one may not even consider. In doing so, Roach helps to bring a shared glory to the Military as a whole, something that I know doesn't happen often enough. I gained a lot of respect for her writing when I made this realization, and I further appreciated the knack she has to make it all so readable. I highly recommend this to any one who has a bit of time to take a little trip through some of the little known and often really weird, areas of military research and operation. "
158,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17379348,4,"This is my first Mary Roach book. I have been meaning to read something of hers for a long time, but when I won an ARC of Grunt, I really had no excuse anymore.So here's the thing. I have a big problem with people who glorify war and who think patriotism excuses despicable acts such as mass murdering. If this book worked for me, it's because it didn't focus on the killing aspect of war, but rather on the surviving. There was no chapter on guns or explosives. In fact, the only weapon mentioned in this book was something called Stench Soup, which was as life-threatening as its name implies.Roach is very funny and relatable, and her curiosity is contagious to the reader. There were certain points in the book when I was not sure what her opinion on war was, or even if she wanted to express one, but that was clarified at the end of the book. Which brings me to my last comment: I really liked the note that the book ended on. I am very particular about endings. Fiction or non-fiction, the way a book ends can make it or break it for me. And by ending, I do not mean the last chapter or even the general resolution. I mean literally the last couple of sentences. Roach, though, wrapped it all up perfectly.To wrap up myself, reading Grunt was an overall very good experience. I laughed, I shuddered, and I learned all kinds of information that I was never meant to know. And when it comes down to it, what more can you ask of a science book?"
159,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2222340-chris,2,"What a disappointment. Grunt it is not. The author's penchant for monosyllabic titles has done her in. Maybe Boom would have been better because this book is not about grunts. The cover has an infantryman with an absurd amount of gear on his back. Yet there is only a page or two about the infantryman and his obscene loads. The subtitle of the book more accurately conveys the substance of this book: the curious science of humans at war. Some areas you would expect some coverage she omitted: woman in combat; NBC defense; biological barrier of flight; vision-we own the night with NVG's and infrared; PTSD; drones and robots; to name a few. What she does cover is two chapters on genital wounds and a long and perhaps irrelevant chapter on stinky things. I enjoyed the chapter on hearing.She was trying to inform and also entertain simultaneously and she didn't pull it off with me. Flippant footnotes in too small a font. Her overly dramatic account of trying to get special operators to talk to her about diarrhea fell flat. This book got rave reviews but it was written by and for the 99 percent of clueless Americans who as the military say ""are at the mall"" while the 1 percent deploy continually in ""endless war."" This book is described as witty, mischievous, fun, and entertaining. Since when has war been that?"
160,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4882193-paul,4,"As with other Mary Roach books I've read, I thoroughly enjoyed this one. And I knew a bit about the subject matter, the military science of keeping soldiers, sailors, and airmen alive, healthy, and at their peak. In my case, it is aviation medicine and physiology. I flew fighters for the USAF, so I know all about altitude chambers, the infamous Nazi experiments of WWII our present-day cold water survival charts are based on, and the improvements we've made over the years in ejection technology. Mary Roach didn't get into the aviation side of military science with this book but she did explore in detail such topics as military clothing, boots, rations, armored vehicle technology, diarrhea and dysentery, the unique injury patterns associated with IEDS and other explosions, submarine escape systems, and sleep management ... critical subjects all, and not often thought of by anyone other than soldiers who have to perform an all kinds of crazy and dangerous environments. Her trademark humor is very much in evidence, and one simply cannot stop turning pages. In case you can't tell, I love Mary Roach and will read anything she writes."
161,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2505581-gary-brecht,3,"A book definitely not for the squeamish, author, Mary Roach, pulls back the curtain to peek at the efforts of our military to protect and patch up our combat soldiers. The reader is given a tour of a wide variety of military units that specialize in such things as testing protective clothing and gear; training submariners to survive a sunken submarine. She introduces us to surgeons who must deal with the physical and psychological consequences of lost limbs. We discover that there is an ongoing analysis of combat deaths where experts examine the remains of fallen soldiers in an effort to learn ways to prevent future lethal incidents. Throughout the book Roach’s dry wit acts as a relief valve for the otherwise serious content. When all is said and done about the heroic efforts of these support units, one still marvels at how cavalierly our leaders commit our youth to war."

One might suspect that this book is about the military in general, or the army in particular. But, really, it is about numerous often overlooked areas of military operations, namely, clothing, vehicle design, genital surgery, staying focused during chaos, diarrhea, bug control, smelliness, sleep deprivation, and more.The author brings out the science behind these topics, and in the process, illuminates many talented, committed, generous, behind the scenes personnel - doctors, scientists, lab workers, staff - who are doing very good work."
163,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8734097-p-d,4,"As always, Roach's books are a delight to read because they ask questions we wouldn't think of asking. When you're told to come up with the main challenges facing a modern soldier, you probably aren't going to name sleep deprivation, diarrhea, or hearing loss right away. She does mention right away that she isn't here to politicize anything, and that she is deliberately not going into PTSD/mental health because there are whole books that do a great job with the topic—but this shouldn't be too surprising as her writing has been consistently quirky, interested in the perspectives without judging them."

She took a quite cavalier and breezy approach to the military, improvements in military technology to prevent horrifying death, and military spending. Only the very last sentence of the book addressed this at all. The chapters also seemed less coherent then usual, covering the army, the navy, genital reconstructive surgery, a shark project from the 1940s, among other subjects, and not adding up to a general picture."

But she has this way of making the most complicated subjects approachable, and so, so fascinating. Roach gives readers a glimpse at the science and humanity behind the people who go to war, instead of the war itself. I just love her to pieces. In fact, I may be developing a bit of a nerdy girl crush on her. #noshame."
168,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53176851-mrs-europaea,4,So interesting to read about the science of war. Mary Roach has a wonderful way of making hard subjects appeal to an average reader and she did this wonderfully in Grunt. Her dry humor and awkwardness makes what could be boring and wordy entertaining without discrediting the hard work of Service members or scientists. 
169,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8101737-peter-tillman,3,"Progress report: Great stuff, but then I came to two chapters on *Genital mutilations* ...Now up to hearing damage. Interesting but not great, and occasionally gross. Roach really likes the gross-out stuff. Not my favorite of her themes.OK, I finished it, more or less. Definitely a mixed bag. I might try it again later, which has worked for me for some of her other books."

Some of the facts I already knew - being sleep deprived for instance. Others were knew to me. What impressed me was all the attempts to help the military individuals live better and healthier lives. A good read."
171,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2199883-aditurbo,1,"DNF. Not her best at all. The anecdotes and information are intriguing, but they're brought to us without any meaningful order, quite disjointedly in fact, and they don't add up to any deeper insight about military life or war, which makes them meaningless. "
172,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3388215-megan,4,Really enjoyed this one. Surprisingly fascinating.
173,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/909255-dna,5,I completely loved this book! Can't believe I didn't review it after reading it.
174,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2007216-peter-derk,4,"Great. Like always. Mary Roach, self-described ""goober with a flashlight"" delivers. Some jerkoff in The New Yorker felt like there were too many jokes in this book, or that Roach's formula failed her this time. If you don't already know how I feel about that review (I DID just call the reviewer a jerkoff), then I'll clarify: that person's kind of a jerkoff.Seemed to me they were all put off because it seems like Mary Roach is having a laugh at the expense of soldiers, which A) isn't true and B) means we were cool having a laugh at astronauts and cadavers in Roach's previous books, and those folks are pretty brave, important, and exposed if you ask me.I thought the critique was especially weird because this book, of all of Roach's I read, finished on a very sweet, thoughtful note. Well, I thought the critique was weird until I remember it was a book critic, so the person probably didn't even read the damn thing.And you know what? If you don't see humor in the idea of stink bombs, this clearly isn't the book for you. Nor is this the Earth for you. Because there is A LOT of smelly shit hanging around here, and some of it's pretty comical. "
175,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6085797-elise,4,"In her typical hilarious style, in this book Mary Roach tackles the science of war. Not the science that will kill the most people on the opposing side, but the one that will keep the most people on this side alive. She participates in a training session for medics in the middle of a battlefield, visits a base in Africa and goes around the mess hall asking about diarrhea, visits a submarine carrying nuclear warheads... all with humour and the greatest respect for what she's describing. Always with the funny anecdotes that will make you literally laugh out loud while you're reading.As in the other two books I read by her, I loved the construction of this one, how each chapter neatly segued into the next one. And the conclusion was lovely, the last sentence was perfect."
176,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1205220-matt,3,"I'm the arrogant sort of person who when I rate a book think that there is some objective element to my rating, and that I'm not merely rating how much I personally enjoyed the book, but also on some level how worthy the book is of enjoyment and how much quality was exercised in the crafting of the book from the level of the individual sentence on up to its grand conceptions and story arc. You might say that in rating a book, my expectation is that everyone else will enjoy the book to within +/- a star of what I rated it, depending on how much the material personally appealed to you and how much - for whatever reasons - you were willing to overlook the books evident flaws. Otherwise, if I did not in fact believe this, whatever would be the reason for rating a book, for if my rating was wholly subjective it would do you no good whatsoever. Mary Roach's book ""Grunt: The Curious Science of Humans at War"" and similar books challenge those presumptions somewhat, in that I don't think a simple one dimensional rating system can in this case predict how much the book will be enjoyed. While for me the book was largely, ""Meh"" and parts of it were grating, that's because the book is pitched at a target audience that just falls outside of anything that would be a sweet spot for me.What's Roach is writing is essentially a primer on basic science and engineering, organized around one of the most interesting fields of basic research in the world today - America's high tech war machine. In an academic world too often focused more on publishing results than doing good work, much less doing anything hard and then managing to repeat it, the Defense Department could care less about how much you publish or where you publish, just so long as you give them tangible solutions. It's research wing DARPA is continually at the forefront of progress. Yet for all this, it's also not just interested in fighting the next war, but also the next and the next, and so very interested in the basic research that may lead to great advances way down the line.Roach approaches this material from a welcome angle, of looking at the less glamorous less macho programs that aim not to create better means of killing people, but rather solve other equally important basic problems of being human in a battlefield environment. For most of human history, man versus nature was still more lethal and more important on a battlefield than the other tribe with its weapons trying to kill you. Infection, disease, starvation, and exposure to the environment killed more men on most military campaigns than the battles did. Roach puts a lens on the modern Defense department's continuing research into keeping soldiers physically and mentally fit during the hardships and horrors of war, and she does so with a self-deprecating, rapier wit and an outsider's eye for the unusual, the bizarre, and details others might miss.It could be the making of a book I really enjoy, but the basic problem here is - I already know most of the stuff she covers. For me, the book would have been more interesting had it been taken in one of two directions. Either it would have been more enjoyable for me to focus less on the science, and more on the persons involved in the science and the interesting characters she discovers along the way and the anecdotes about them. This is information I don't have, and some of the biographies she uncovers are interesting in their own right - but she doesn't ever go into these people in any great depth, relying instead on deft caricature to set the stage like a comic book artist or a good Game Master. On the other hand, when she delves into the actual science and engineering, I occasionally discovered something I didn't know before, but then all too quickly she was plowing on to some other topic or providing some basic exposition of another fundamental aspect of the science or engineering problem being discussed. As a result, she never actually went into any one subject with the depth I would have liked.And all this time she's trying to be a comedian as well, with varying degree of success. Personally, as a near autistic, many of her wry asides just struck me as being mean spirited. She had enough empathy for her audience that I didn't feel like she was treating the reader to a tour through a carnival freak show - ""Come see the geeks"" - but at times I did feel like she felt her desired audience wouldn't understand her empathy, and she still needed to convince them that she wasn't one of the nerds and that she certainly didn't approve of this whole military thing so that she'll still get invited to parties with the right sort of people in SF. That is to say, some of the humor seemed a bit jarring and out of place, like she was two people - one admiring interviewer and the other hidden one that was laughing at who she was interviewing -and she was better when her asides and jokes were humble.In short, I'm convinced that for the right sort of person who has never even thought of these sort of things, and who enjoys science even if they don't practice it themselves, or has a narrow field of view and hasn't looked much at the big picture this is a five star book. Mrs. Roach has in effect here done admirable journalism and investigation, and turned obscure but important areas of endeavor into a readable funny work suitable for wide consumption. Despite the three stars, I strongly recommend this book to anyone who doesn't have any interest in the military, or whose interest in either science or the military has been at most casual."
177,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/136066-casey,4,"It's best to approach most Mary Roach books as collections of essays based on a common topic. This isn't my first rodeo with her (can you write about rodeos next, Mary? I won't take a fee for that suggestion), so I knew this would be all over the place. However, I didn't predict just how expansive a topic military science would be. While I anticipated chapters on topics like sleep deprivation, I can honestly say that I knew nothing of penile reconstruction before this. Now I (and whoever read over my shoulder on the subway) know a whole lot! Seriously fascinating stuff, as always."

If you would have asked me to read a book about the military and war, I probably would have said no thanks. However, Roach makes you want to read about the topic. She provides an angle not normally contemplated, but intriguing none the less. "

182,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4272284-kristina,4,"Mary Roach makes science fun. I mean, I think science is fun anyway, but she makes it accessible for non-scientists and she makes it practical. Grunt: The Curious Science of Humans At War is her latest book and I enjoyed it very much. Once again, she tackles scientific topics no one else would think to address and she does it with curiosity, respect, humor and enthusiasm. Grunt explores the science of war and the problems soldiers must deal with (other than the reality of being shot or blown up). After reading these chapters, you realize how much we truly owe our soldiers.I never ever would have thought about military uniforms. Never in a million years. But here’s Roach with a whole chapter about this very topic. Apparently, the fabric of a uniform can affect a soldier’s ability to fight well. That seems like common sense now, but who thinks about this stuff? This is what a modern uniform must do (or come as close as possible): If possible, the army would like to dress its men and women in uniforms that protect them against all that modern warfare has to throw at them: flames, explosives, bullets, lasers, bomb-blasted dirt, blister agents, anthrax, sand fleas. They would like these same uniforms to keep soldiers cool and dry in extreme heat, to stand up to the ruthless rigors of the Army field laundry, to feel good against the skin, to look smart, and to come in under budget. It might be easier to resolve the conflicts in the Middle East (21).She should have added that they be quiet—zippers and buttons and velcro can be noisy and noise can give away a soldier’s position. Extensive testing of fabrics and designs goes on at the US Army Natick Soldier Research, Development and Engineering Center. It’s extremely involved and high-tech. From equipping soldiers with the appropriate clothes to putting them in vehicles that will shield them as much as possible from explosions and gunfire, Roach moves her focus to the human body itself and how the military tries to repair war injuries. Roach being Roach, she doesn’t discuss the usual prosthetics. Why should she? It’s a well-researched topic. No, Mary explores what happens when men have groin damage and their genitals have to be reconstructed. Penis transplants are also now possible. Roach witnessed the procedure (done on cadavers only) and said that by the time the book is published, the first ever penis transplant may have occurred. This chapter was kind of gross, but also very interesting. Roach discusses the possible psychological problems these transplants may cause.The problems of diarrhea, the helpfulness of maggots, and the strain of heat exhaustion are all topics covered in more detail than you may care for, but that’s Mary Roach—she doesn’t leave anything out. The chapters dealing with life in submarines was the most interesting for me, probably due to the lasting impressions the movie The Abyss had on me. I first saw that movie years ago and to do this day I’ve been fascinated with the idea of submarines and the perils of underwater living. It’s also a kick ass movie and I highly recommend it; it vividly shows the consequences of sea water pressure on mechanical objects. Mary Roach is a delight. Her self-deprecating humor and willingness to be a human guinea pig whenever asked (seriously, read her book Bonk. She does not embarrass easily) makes her science books fun to read. She asks the questions you would be reluctant to ask (even if it occurred to you to ask them) and she enthusiastically pursues the answers. If you’re interested in science, read her books. Even if you’re not interested, read her books. I think Mary Roach’s books should be read by high school students so they can understand that science has very real and practical uses. Plus, they will realize that it’s fun."
183,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4361541-barb-middleton,4,"Every time I sit down to write this review, I struggle with the right words and can't help but feel like a ""goober"" myself. Journalist Mary Roach has a terrific voice that makes this science piece easy-to-read and while I laughed, for the most part, there were other times when it was too much. I am glad I read it after, ""The Pentagon's Brain: An Uncensored History of DARPA, America's Top-Secret Military Research Agency"" by Annie Jacobsen because it gave me some historical context that is lacking in Roach's book. Roach is upfront about not specializing in history or science, ""I'm the goober with the flashlight, stumbling into corners and crannies..."" Parts of her story were interesting, others not, and the end definitely abrupt; however, I appreciate the attempt to create characters that are easily visualized. Although even that got repetitive at times. The book doesn't quite nail it, but it is worth reading if you want to know about the side of the military that gets little press such as fabric design for combat, blast wounds, medic training, hearing loss, types of repellents, phalloplasty, and diarrhea to name a few. Her self-deprecating humor and figurative language add to the light tone and great voice. She pokes fun at her lack of knowledge throughout such as thinking that a mechanic's tattoo of pistons are martial arts weapons because of his fierce appearance. On a ship, she makes the mistake of identifying rifle holders as cup holders. She creates characters through detailed descriptions that I liked but became somewhat repetitious, particularly at the start. It seemed most people were gorgeous, adorable, or muscular: ""She is gorgeous, articulate, fast-moving, powerful. Lesser humans left blinking in her wake"" or ""...with a superhero jaw and muscles so big that when he walks in front of the slide projector, entire images can be viewed on his forearm"" or "" you wouldn't use the word distinguished but adorable."" Another officer is ""droll"" and ""adorable"". Even the maggots are ""adorable"" as ""they move like inchworms, like something you might see humping along the pages of a children's book."" That image gave me pause. Here's another one, ""His incisors touch down on his lower lip like children jumping on a bed."" No adorable, but an interesting simile. A fun made-up word is, ""The whole business is straight off my fathometer."" Sometimes she kapow's the reader with phrases that hide her lack of depth on a topic. Other times the book has a seriousness and poignancy that is insightful. She admires the bonding of soldiers and selflessness that defies reason. A man that lost both legs was more concerned about his fellow soldiers being okay than the fact he'd just stepped on an IED. Or how another soldier lost his limbs but said the worst part was losing his hearing because it made it so difficult to communicate with his wife and children. Or the part about how much the government spent millions on shark repellent based on one man's experience and another's political connections. She nails it sometimes and misses the mark at others. And the chapters are connected in a loose manner. As a journalism major, I enjoyed and admired how Mary Roach wrote this piece. She tackles many different topics and perhaps this is the downfall. It might have been better if she had focused on fewer. If you are looking for something historical or scientific then you might want to pair this with another book. "
184,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1345046-todd-martin,3,"Grunt is Mary Roach’s latest book in which she examines technologies associated with  The Curious Science of Humans at War. Well, not really ‘war’ per se, her approach is to focus on technologies involved in keeping soldiers alive and comfortable while minimizing any discussion of weapons, killing or the subject of war itself. This is rather a fine line to tread since the purpose of keeping soldiers alive and comfortable is so that they can do their job (which often involves the use of lethal weapons to end human life), but Roach is known for writing about quirky science topics in an off-beat and humorous way, and the act of creating a fist sized-hole in a human body with a high velocity rifle round isn’t a subject that naturally lends itself to hilarity. Roach is also flirting with a topic fraught with controversy (the bloated US military budget, politicians pork barrel spending, US foreign policy, the national debt, unilateralism, torture, wars of choice, terrorism, drone strikes, civilian casualties, friendly fire, war crimes, the military industrial complex, the treatment of veterans, suicide rates, the conflict in the Middle East and on and on). Her approach is to desperately seek subjects that provide a safe haven so as to avoid any possibly of providing offense (while still managing to work excrement and genitalia into the conversation … obviously). Thus she has chosen to discuss such minutia as: the fabrics and fasteners used in military garments, vehicle armor, hearing protection, penis reconstruction surgery, dysentery remedies, heat exhaustion, sleep deprivation, and others. It’s not that these topics are unimportant (the clothes worn by a soldier while patrolling in a brutally hot desert environment certainly play a role in their comfort, safety and effectiveness), but by focusing on individuals who sweat the small stuff, she’s making a conscious decision to willfully ignore the big stuff. I'll also point out that, other than her coverage of submarine rescues, the remaining topics apply just as much to civilians as they do to the military. Roach is also extremely careful in her use of humor in the book, restricting it mainly to that of self-deprecation. A typical example follows the formula:Roach: Oh look, these uniforms have such cute pockets. They’d be perfect for carrying accessories like my bedazzler or a fresh banana. Military Personnel: That’s magazine holster for an M16A2 assault rifle ma’am.{Cue the trombone}: Wah - wah - waaaah.Given the carefully contrived scope of the book, I would characterize the restricted list of topics discussed as modestly interesting. But after having read most of Roach’s other work I feel like her ‘unflinching glimpse into salacious topics’ style has crossed over into the realm of self-parody. Enough already with the preternatural preoccupation with pee-pee, ca-ca, and the orifices from which these substances emerge."
185,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51152697-kate,4,"This is a book about military science: the study of those things that might affect personnel in combat.he author has a reasonable sense of humor which is much like the military and black humor I am used too. In several places I laughed out loud, as when someone heard a rumor that red fabric had cooling properties. The Army decide to test this in the Philippines and had red under ware designed and ordered and red hat liners...they were anything but cool and the men sweated in places no one wants to sweat, and the red dye ran when wet down into the men's nether parts staining them much to the humor of the control group who wore white under garments. This was 1908 and the services were still on a learning curve.It covers everthing from uniform design, specifications for buttons, why zippers don't work special needs of snipers in gear requirements. How cloth is selected and engineered to wick moisture, retain body heat or allow cooling in hot desert climates. Uniform design: although it didn't mention helmet design which I have been told has been responsible for some of the serious facial burns in IE explosions. The research on the amount of water needed in desert conditions when soldiers burdened with a hundred ponds of gear, armour, supplies and munitions have to expend energy in day time heat of 120-135o. It also covers how the body beaks down when too much water is consumed.Of course it addresses the gigantic toll of intestinal distress from contaminated food, flies and sand tics, and the research that was started during the Spanish American war up to present.Studies and testing to properly armour up vehicles, how to protect bodies within vehicles from the tremendous bone shattering concussions. Much other research is cover in sections, how to prepare Medics to cope with the carnage of the injuries caused by modern weapons.Very interesting book, having family members that have worked in procurement, a son who was a Medical Officer in serving in theater I was familiar with some of the things covered, and the complaints of those who did not want one more piece of protective gear to weight them down or obstruct their movement. A good read for anyone not familiar with what many of the military research teams deal with."
186,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1462387-karyl,5,"Mary Roach is like that little precocious kid that always asks, ""But WHY?!"" I don't think she ever grew out of that stage, and that is lucky for us. She has so many questions to satisfy her curiosity about literally everything, and it's that which fuels her books. I knew I was going to enjoy this book, simply because she wrote it, but it's even more amusing yet fascinating than even I had imagined!I'm glad that Mary Roach didn't go into the normal things you think of when you think of war -- things like guns, or bombs, or IEDs. Instead we look at the fabrics the military uses in its uniforms (I am rather glad I was ignorant of how easily flame retardancy washes out of fabric after my husband finished out all his years at sea, since his favorite coveralls were about as old as some of the guys under him), keeping troops safe when driving through dangerous areas (who knew they'd have to completely redesign the crash test dummy for upward impacts?!), hearing loss (something I'm quite familiar with, since my husband spent the last 23 years in the engine room of various warships), what happens when a guy gets shot in the junk, even how to keep troops free of diarrhea in the field. There is so much in this book that the average person just has never thought of in regards to military science, and of course, Roach injects her own brand of humor at just the right times for a little bit of levity. Read this book, even if you have zero interest in military science. It's funny, it's informative, it's just a good read. I found myself reading out whole pages to my husband while we were on a long drive, and now he (almost) wants to read it himself!"
187,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8733987-christina,4,"This was my first experience with Mary Roach. While the topics she chose to research were fascinating, it was her sense of humor and how it blended in to her style of writing, that I could not relate to at the start of the book. I wasn't sure if she was mocking, making light of or was just generally trying to be funny, in regards of the areas she chose to research for this book. For this reason, I spent the first couple of essays a bit pissed off that she could possibly be making light of such a respectful arena. By about the 3rd chapter, I got a feel for her general reverence and then it all just clicked. I'm a believer and I want to get my hands on all that she has to write. Roach has the ability to bring to the light of day, areas of the military that we may never even give a moment of thought about and surely not consider of importance to the bigger picture of soldiers and the theatre of war. So, not only does she look into the nooks and crannies of the American military, she gives credit to ALL of the MEGA-research that goes in to daily operations that one may not even consider. In doing so, Roach helps to bring a shared glory to the Military as a whole, something that I know doesn't happen often enough. I gained a lot of respect for her writing when I made this realization, and I further appreciated the knack she has to make it all so readable. I highly recommend this to any one who has a bit of time to take a little trip through some of the little known and often really weird, areas of military research and operation. "
188,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17379348,4,"This is my first Mary Roach book. I have been meaning to read something of hers for a long time, but when I won an ARC of Grunt, I really had no excuse anymore.So here's the thing. I have a big problem with people who glorify war and who think patriotism excuses despicable acts such as mass murdering. If this book worked for me, it's because it didn't focus on the killing aspect of war, but rather on the surviving. There was no chapter on guns or explosives. In fact, the only weapon mentioned in this book was something called Stench Soup, which was as life-threatening as its name implies.Roach is very funny and relatable, and her curiosity is contagious to the reader. There were certain points in the book when I was not sure what her opinion on war was, or even if she wanted to express one, but that was clarified at the end of the book. Which brings me to my last comment: I really liked the note that the book ended on. I am very particular about endings. Fiction or non-fiction, the way a book ends can make it or break it for me. And by ending, I do not mean the last chapter or even the general resolution. I mean literally the last couple of sentences. Roach, though, wrapped it all up perfectly.To wrap up myself, reading Grunt was an overall very good experience. I laughed, I shuddered, and I learned all kinds of information that I was never meant to know. And when it comes down to it, what more can you ask of a science book?"
189,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2222340-chris,2,"What a disappointment. Grunt it is not. The author's penchant for monosyllabic titles has done her in. Maybe Boom would have been better because this book is not about grunts. The cover has an infantryman with an absurd amount of gear on his back. Yet there is only a page or two about the infantryman and his obscene loads. The subtitle of the book more accurately conveys the substance of this book: the curious science of humans at war. Some areas you would expect some coverage she omitted: woman in combat; NBC defense; biological barrier of flight; vision-we own the night with NVG's and infrared; PTSD; drones and robots; to name a few. What she does cover is two chapters on genital wounds and a long and perhaps irrelevant chapter on stinky things. I enjoyed the chapter on hearing.She was trying to inform and also entertain simultaneously and she didn't pull it off with me. Flippant footnotes in too small a font. Her overly dramatic account of trying to get special operators to talk to her about diarrhea fell flat. This book got rave reviews but it was written by and for the 99 percent of clueless Americans who as the military say ""are at the mall"" while the 1 percent deploy continually in ""endless war."" This book is described as witty, mischievous, fun, and entertaining. Since when has war been that?"
190,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4882193-paul,4,"As with other Mary Roach books I've read, I thoroughly enjoyed this one. And I knew a bit about the subject matter, the military science of keeping soldiers, sailors, and airmen alive, healthy, and at their peak. In my case, it is aviation medicine and physiology. I flew fighters for the USAF, so I know all about altitude chambers, the infamous Nazi experiments of WWII our present-day cold water survival charts are based on, and the improvements we've made over the years in ejection technology. Mary Roach didn't get into the aviation side of military science with this book but she did explore in detail such topics as military clothing, boots, rations, armored vehicle technology, diarrhea and dysentery, the unique injury patterns associated with IEDS and other explosions, submarine escape systems, and sleep management ... critical subjects all, and not often thought of by anyone other than soldiers who have to perform an all kinds of crazy and dangerous environments. Her trademark humor is very much in evidence, and one simply cannot stop turning pages. In case you can't tell, I love Mary Roach and will read anything she writes."
191,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2505581-gary-brecht,3,"A book definitely not for the squeamish, author, Mary Roach, pulls back the curtain to peek at the efforts of our military to protect and patch up our combat soldiers. The reader is given a tour of a wide variety of military units that specialize in such things as testing protective clothing and gear; training submariners to survive a sunken submarine. She introduces us to surgeons who must deal with the physical and psychological consequences of lost limbs. We discover that there is an ongoing analysis of combat deaths where experts examine the remains of fallen soldiers in an effort to learn ways to prevent future lethal incidents. Throughout the book Roach’s dry wit acts as a relief valve for the otherwise serious content. When all is said and done about the heroic efforts of these support units, one still marvels at how cavalierly our leaders commit our youth to war."

One might suspect that this book is about the military in general, or the army in particular. But, really, it is about numerous often overlooked areas of military operations, namely, clothing, vehicle design, genital surgery, staying focused during chaos, diarrhea, bug control, smelliness, sleep deprivation, and more.The author brings out the science behind these topics, and in the process, illuminates many talented, committed, generous, behind the scenes personnel - doctors, scientists, lab workers, staff - who are doing very good work."

When you're told to come up with the main challenges facing a modern soldier, you probably aren't going to name sleep deprivation, diarrhea, or hearing loss right away. She does mention right away that she isn't here to politicize anything, and that she is deliberately not going into PTSD/mental health because there are whole books that do a great job with the topic—but this shouldn't be too surprising as her writing has been consistently quirky, interested in the perspectives without judging them."

Thankfully, Roach has gone before and asked the awkward questions. Yeah, new weapons and planes and ships have to be developed, I knew about those enormous contracts.. But also someone has to work out all the other stuff: what things do people really need to carry? what’s the best way to keep people alive? What makes a weapon ideal? Roach is out there following her curiousity to places I never considered, and arousing mine.Library copy"
195,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4070288-jo,3,"I love Mary Roach, and her usual interesting facts and humor are on display in this book, but the tone did not match the material as well as it usually does. She took a quite cavalier and breezy approach to the military, improvements in military technology to prevent horrifying death, and military spending. Only the very last sentence of the book addressed this at all. The chapters also seemed less coherent then usual, covering the army, the navy, genital reconstructive surgery, a shark project from the 1940s, among other subjects, and not adding up to a general picture."

This book took me places I did not expect to go and I now know something about genital reconstruction and a lot more about poop. Mary makes me a more interesting person. She also does the best descriptions of people. I'd love to find a way for her to interview me about something, just so that I can read how she chooses to describe me.I love what she's doing for science writing and as always, I would happily recommend this to anyone who thinks they don't enjoy nonfiction or someone who finds science writing intimidating."

I never would have thought I would enjoy a non fiction book about science...let alone one involving the military. But she has this way of making the most complicated subjects approachable, and so, so fascinating. Roach gives readers a glimpse at the science and humanity behind the people who go to war, instead of the war itself. I just love her to pieces. In fact, I may be developing a bit of a nerdy girl crush on her. #noshame."
198,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53176851-mrs-europaea,4,So interesting to read about the science of war. Mary Roach has a wonderful way of making hard subjects appeal to an average reader and she did this wonderfully in Grunt. Her dry humor and awkwardness makes what could be boring and wordy entertaining without discrediting the hard work of Service members or scientists.

Interesting but not great, and occasionally gross. Roach really likes the gross-out stuff. Not my favorite of her themes.OK, I finished it, more or less. Definitely a mixed bag. I might try it again later, which has worked for me for some of her other books."

Some of the facts I already knew - being sleep deprived for instance. Others were knew to me. What impressed me was all the attempts to help the military individuals live better and healthier lives. A good read."

The anecdotes and information are intriguing, but they're brought to us without any meaningful order, quite disjointedly in fact, and they don't add up to any deeper insight about military life or war, which makes them meaningless.

204,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2007216-peter-derk,4,"Great. Like always. Mary Roach, self-described ""goober with a flashlight"" delivers. Some jerkoff in The New Yorker felt like there were too many jokes in this book, or that Roach's formula failed her this time. If you don't already know how I feel about that review (I DID just call the reviewer a jerkoff), then I'll clarify: that person's kind of a jerkoff.Seemed to me they were all put off because it seems like Mary Roach is having a laugh at the expense of soldiers, which A) isn't true and B) means we were cool having a laugh at astronauts and cadavers in Roach's previous books, and those folks are pretty brave, important, and exposed if you ask me.I thought the critique was especially weird because this book, of all of Roach's I read, finished on a very sweet, thoughtful note. Well, I thought the critique was weird until I remember it was a book critic, so the person probably didn't even read the damn thing.And you know what? If you don't see humor in the idea of stink bombs, this clearly isn't the book for you. Nor is this the Earth for you. Because there is A LOT of smelly shit hanging around here, and some of it's pretty comical. "
205,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6085797-elise,4,"In her typical hilarious style, in this book Mary Roach tackles the science of war. Not the science that will kill the most people on the opposing side, but the one that will keep the most people on this side alive. She participates in a training session for medics in the middle of a battlefield, visits a base in Africa and goes around the mess hall asking about diarrhea, visits a submarine carrying nuclear warheads... all with humour and the greatest respect for what she's describing. Always with the funny anecdotes that will make you literally laugh out loud while you're reading.As in the other two books I read by her, I loved the construction of this one, how each chapter neatly segued into the next one. And the conclusion was lovely, the last sentence was perfect."
206,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1205220-matt,3,"I'm the arrogant sort of person who when I rate a book think that there is some objective element to my rating, and that I'm not merely rating how much I personally enjoyed the book, but also on some level how worthy the book is of enjoyment and how much quality was exercised in the crafting of the book from the level of the individual sentence on up to its grand conceptions and story arc. You might say that in rating a book, my expectation is that everyone else will enjoy the book to within +/- a star of what I rated it, depending on how much the material personally appealed to you and how much - for whatever reasons - you were willing to overlook the books evident flaws. Otherwise, if I did not in fact believe this, whatever would be the reason for rating a book, for if my rating was wholly subjective it would do you no good whatsoever. Mary Roach's book ""Grunt: The Curious Science of Humans at War"" and similar books challenge those presumptions somewhat, in that I don't think a simple one dimensional rating system can in this case predict how much the book will be enjoyed. While for me the book was largely, ""Meh"" and parts of it were grating, that's because the book is pitched at a target audience that just falls outside of anything that would be a sweet spot for me.What's Roach is writing is essentially a primer on basic science and engineering, organized around one of the most interesting fields of basic research in the world today - America's high tech war machine. In an academic world too often focused more on publishing results than doing good work, much less doing anything hard and then managing to repeat it, the Defense Department could care less about how much you publish or where you publish, just so long as you give them tangible solutions. It's research wing DARPA is continually at the forefront of progress. Yet for all this, it's also not just interested in fighting the next war, but also the next and the next, and so very interested in the basic research that may lead to great advances way down the line.Roach approaches this material from a welcome angle, of looking at the less glamorous less macho programs that aim not to create better means of killing people, but rather solve other equally important basic problems of being human in a battlefield environment. For most of human history, man versus nature was still more lethal and more important on a battlefield than the other tribe with its weapons trying to kill you. Infection, disease, starvation, and exposure to the environment killed more men on most military campaigns than the battles did. Roach puts a lens on the modern Defense department's continuing research into keeping soldiers physically and mentally fit during the hardships and horrors of war, and she does so with a self-deprecating, rapier wit and an outsider's eye for the unusual, the bizarre, and details others might miss.It could be the making of a book I really enjoy, but the basic problem here is - I already know most of the stuff she covers. For me, the book would have been more interesting had it been taken in one of two directions. Either it would have been more enjoyable for me to focus less on the science, and more on the persons involved in the science and the interesting characters she discovers along the way and the anecdotes about them. This is information I don't have, and some of the biographies she uncovers are interesting in their own right - but she doesn't ever go into these people in any great depth, relying instead on deft caricature to set the stage like a comic book artist or a good Game Master. On the other hand, when she delves into the actual science and engineering, I occasionally discovered something I didn't know before, but then all too quickly she was plowing on to some other topic or providing some basic exposition of another fundamental aspect of the science or engineering problem being discussed. As a result, she never actually went into any one subject with the depth I would have liked.And all this time she's trying to be a comedian as well, with varying degree of success. Personally, as a near autistic, many of her wry asides just struck me as being mean spirited. She had enough empathy for her audience that I didn't feel like she was treating the reader to a tour through a carnival freak show - ""Come see the geeks"" - but at times I did feel like she felt her desired audience wouldn't understand her empathy, and she still needed to convince them that she wasn't one of the nerds and that she certainly didn't approve of this whole military thing so that she'll still get invited to parties with the right sort of people in SF. That is to say, some of the humor seemed a bit jarring and out of place, like she was two people - one admiring interviewer and the other hidden one that was laughing at who she was interviewing -and she was better when her asides and jokes were humble.In short, I'm convinced that for the right sort of person who has never even thought of these sort of things, and who enjoys science even if they don't practice it themselves, or has a narrow field of view and hasn't looked much at the big picture this is a five star book. Mrs. Roach has in effect here done admirable journalism and investigation, and turned obscure but important areas of endeavor into a readable funny work suitable for wide consumption. Despite the three stars, I strongly recommend this book to anyone who doesn't have any interest in the military, or whose interest in either science or the military has been at most casual."
207,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/136066-casey,4,"It's best to approach most Mary Roach books as collections of essays based on a common topic. This isn't my first rodeo with her (can you write about rodeos next, Mary? I won't take a fee for that suggestion), so I knew this would be all over the place. However, I didn't predict just how expansive a topic military science would be. While I anticipated chapters on topics like sleep deprivation, I can honestly say that I knew nothing of penile reconstruction before this. Now I (and whoever read over my shoulder on the subway) know a whole lot! Seriously fascinating stuff, as always."

If you would have asked me to read a book about the military and war, I probably would have said no thanks. However, Roach makes you want to read about the topic. She provides an angle not normally contemplated, but intriguing none the less. "

212,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4272284-kristina,4,"Mary Roach makes science fun. I mean, I think science is fun anyway, but she makes it accessible for non-scientists and she makes it practical. Grunt: The Curious Science of Humans At War is her latest book and I enjoyed it very much. Once again, she tackles scientific topics no one else would think to address and she does it with curiosity, respect, humor and enthusiasm. Grunt explores the science of war and the problems soldiers must deal with (other than the reality of being shot or blown up). After reading these chapters, you realize how much we truly owe our soldiers.I never ever would have thought about military uniforms. Never in a million years. But here’s Roach with a whole chapter about this very topic. Apparently, the fabric of a uniform can affect a soldier’s ability to fight well. That seems like common sense now, but who thinks about this stuff? This is what a modern uniform must do (or come as close as possible): If possible, the army would like to dress its men and women in uniforms that protect them against all that modern warfare has to throw at them: flames, explosives, bullets, lasers, bomb-blasted dirt, blister agents, anthrax, sand fleas. They would like these same uniforms to keep soldiers cool and dry in extreme heat, to stand up to the ruthless rigors of the Army field laundry, to feel good against the skin, to look smart, and to come in under budget. It might be easier to resolve the conflicts in the Middle East (21).She should have added that they be quiet—zippers and buttons and velcro can be noisy and noise can give away a soldier’s position. Extensive testing of fabrics and designs goes on at the US Army Natick Soldier Research, Development and Engineering Center. It’s extremely involved and high-tech. From equipping soldiers with the appropriate clothes to putting them in vehicles that will shield them as much as possible from explosions and gunfire, Roach moves her focus to the human body itself and how the military tries to repair war injuries. Roach being Roach, she doesn’t discuss the usual prosthetics. Why should she? It’s a well-researched topic. No, Mary explores what happens when men have groin damage and their genitals have to be reconstructed. Penis transplants are also now possible. Roach witnessed the procedure (done on cadavers only) and said that by the time the book is published, the first ever penis transplant may have occurred. This chapter was kind of gross, but also very interesting. Roach discusses the possible psychological problems these transplants may cause.The problems of diarrhea, the helpfulness of maggots, and the strain of heat exhaustion are all topics covered in more detail than you may care for, but that’s Mary Roach—she doesn’t leave anything out. The chapters dealing with life in submarines was the most interesting for me, probably due to the lasting impressions the movie The Abyss had on me. I first saw that movie years ago and to do this day I’ve been fascinated with the idea of submarines and the perils of underwater living. It’s also a kick ass movie and I highly recommend it; it vividly shows the consequences of sea water pressure on mechanical objects. Mary Roach is a delight. Her self-deprecating humor and willingness to be a human guinea pig whenever asked (seriously, read her book Bonk. She does not embarrass easily) makes her science books fun to read. She asks the questions you would be reluctant to ask (even if it occurred to you to ask them) and she enthusiastically pursues the answers. If you’re interested in science, read her books. Even if you’re not interested, read her books. I think Mary Roach’s books should be read by high school students so they can understand that science has very real and practical uses. Plus, they will realize that it’s fun."
213,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4361541-barb-middleton,4,"Every time I sit down to write this review, I struggle with the right words and can't help but feel like a ""goober"" myself. Journalist Mary Roach has a terrific voice that makes this science piece easy-to-read and while I laughed, for the most part, there were other times when it was too much. I am glad I read it after, ""The Pentagon's Brain: An Uncensored History of DARPA, America's Top-Secret Military Research Agency"" by Annie Jacobsen because it gave me some historical context that is lacking in Roach's book. Roach is upfront about not specializing in history or science, ""I'm the goober with the flashlight, stumbling into corners and crannies..."" Parts of her story were interesting, others not, and the end definitely abrupt; however, I appreciate the attempt to create characters that are easily visualized. Although even that got repetitive at times. The book doesn't quite nail it, but it is worth reading if you want to know about the side of the military that gets little press such as fabric design for combat, blast wounds, medic training, hearing loss, types of repellents, phalloplasty, and diarrhea to name a few. Her self-deprecating humor and figurative language add to the light tone and great voice. She pokes fun at her lack of knowledge throughout such as thinking that a mechanic's tattoo of pistons are martial arts weapons because of his fierce appearance. On a ship, she makes the mistake of identifying rifle holders as cup holders. She creates characters through detailed descriptions that I liked but became somewhat repetitious, particularly at the start. It seemed most people were gorgeous, adorable, or muscular: ""She is gorgeous, articulate, fast-moving, powerful. Lesser humans left blinking in her wake"" or ""...with a superhero jaw and muscles so big that when he walks in front of the slide projector, entire images can be viewed on his forearm"" or "" you wouldn't use the word distinguished but adorable."" Another officer is ""droll"" and ""adorable"". Even the maggots are ""adorable"" as ""they move like inchworms, like something you might see humping along the pages of a children's book."" That image gave me pause. Here's another one, ""His incisors touch down on his lower lip like children jumping on a bed."" No adorable, but an interesting simile. A fun made-up word is, ""The whole business is straight off my fathometer."" Sometimes she kapow's the reader with phrases that hide her lack of depth on a topic. Other times the book has a seriousness and poignancy that is insightful. She admires the bonding of soldiers and selflessness that defies reason. A man that lost both legs was more concerned about his fellow soldiers being okay than the fact he'd just stepped on an IED. Or how another soldier lost his limbs but said the worst part was losing his hearing because it made it so difficult to communicate with his wife and children. Or the part about how much the government spent millions on shark repellent based on one man's experience and another's political connections. She nails it sometimes and misses the mark at others. And the chapters are connected in a loose manner. As a journalism major, I enjoyed and admired how Mary Roach wrote this piece. She tackles many different topics and perhaps this is the downfall. It might have been better if she had focused on fewer. If you are looking for something historical or scientific then you might want to pair this with another book. "
214,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1345046-todd-martin,3,"Grunt is Mary Roach’s latest book in which she examines technologies associated with  The Curious Science of Humans at War. Well, not really ‘war’ per se, her approach is to focus on technologies involved in keeping soldiers alive and comfortable while minimizing any discussion of weapons, killing or the subject of war itself. This is rather a fine line to tread since the purpose of keeping soldiers alive and comfortable is so that they can do their job (which often involves the use of lethal weapons to end human life), but Roach is known for writing about quirky science topics in an off-beat and humorous way, and the act of creating a fist sized-hole in a human body with a high velocity rifle round isn’t a subject that naturally lends itself to hilarity. Roach is also flirting with a topic fraught with controversy (the bloated US military budget, politicians pork barrel spending, US foreign policy, the national debt, unilateralism, torture, wars of choice, terrorism, drone strikes, civilian casualties, friendly fire, war crimes, the military industrial complex, the treatment of veterans, suicide rates, the conflict in the Middle East and on and on). Her approach is to desperately seek subjects that provide a safe haven so as to avoid any possibly of providing offense (while still managing to work excrement and genitalia into the conversation … obviously). Thus she has chosen to discuss such minutia as: the fabrics and fasteners used in military garments, vehicle armor, hearing protection, penis reconstruction surgery, dysentery remedies, heat exhaustion, sleep deprivation, and others. It’s not that these topics are unimportant (the clothes worn by a soldier while patrolling in a brutally hot desert environment certainly play a role in their comfort, safety and effectiveness), but by focusing on individuals who sweat the small stuff, she’s making a conscious decision to willfully ignore the big stuff. I'll also point out that, other than her coverage of submarine rescues, the remaining topics apply just as much to civilians as they do to the military. Roach is also extremely careful in her use of humor in the book, restricting it mainly to that of self-deprecation. A typical example follows the formula:Roach: Oh look, these uniforms have such cute pockets. They’d be perfect for carrying accessories like my bedazzler or a fresh banana. Military Personnel: That’s magazine holster for an M16A2 assault rifle ma’am.{Cue the trombone}: Wah - wah - waaaah.Given the carefully contrived scope of the book, I would characterize the restricted list of topics discussed as modestly interesting. But after having read most of Roach’s other work I feel like her ‘unflinching glimpse into salacious topics’ style has crossed over into the realm of self-parody. Enough already with the preternatural preoccupation with pee-pee, ca-ca, and the orifices from which these substances emerge."
215,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51152697-kate,4,"This is a book about military science: the study of those things that might affect personnel in combat.he author has a reasonable sense of humor which is much like the military and black humor I am used too. In several places I laughed out loud, as when someone heard a rumor that red fabric had cooling properties. The Army decide to test this in the Philippines and had red under ware designed and ordered and red hat liners...they were anything but cool and the men sweated in places no one wants to sweat, and the red dye ran when wet down into the men's nether parts staining them much to the humor of the control group who wore white under garments. This was 1908 and the services were still on a learning curve.It covers everthing from uniform design, specifications for buttons, why zippers don't work special needs of snipers in gear requirements. How cloth is selected and engineered to wick moisture, retain body heat or allow cooling in hot desert climates. Uniform design: although it didn't mention helmet design which I have been told has been responsible for some of the serious facial burns in IE explosions. The research on the amount of water needed in desert conditions when soldiers burdened with a hundred ponds of gear, armour, supplies and munitions have to expend energy in day time heat of 120-135o. It also covers how the body beaks down when too much water is consumed.Of course it addresses the gigantic toll of intestinal distress from contaminated food, flies and sand tics, and the research that was started during the Spanish American war up to present.Studies and testing to properly armour up vehicles, how to protect bodies within vehicles from the tremendous bone shattering concussions. Much other research is cover in sections, how to prepare Medics to cope with the carnage of the injuries caused by modern weapons.Very interesting book, having family members that have worked in procurement, a son who was a Medical Officer in serving in theater I was familiar with some of the things covered, and the complaints of those who did not want one more piece of protective gear to weight them down or obstruct their movement. A good read for anyone not familiar with what many of the military research teams deal with."
216,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1462387-karyl,5,"Mary Roach is like that little precocious kid that always asks, ""But WHY?!"" I don't think she ever grew out of that stage, and that is lucky for us. She has so many questions to satisfy her curiosity about literally everything, and it's that which fuels her books. I knew I was going to enjoy this book, simply because she wrote it, but it's even more amusing yet fascinating than even I had imagined!I'm glad that Mary Roach didn't go into the normal things you think of when you think of war -- things like guns, or bombs, or IEDs. Instead we look at the fabrics the military uses in its uniforms (I am rather glad I was ignorant of how easily flame retardancy washes out of fabric after my husband finished out all his years at sea, since his favorite coveralls were about as old as some of the guys under him), keeping troops safe when driving through dangerous areas (who knew they'd have to completely redesign the crash test dummy for upward impacts?!), hearing loss (something I'm quite familiar with, since my husband spent the last 23 years in the engine room of various warships), what happens when a guy gets shot in the junk, even how to keep troops free of diarrhea in the field. There is so much in this book that the average person just has never thought of in regards to military science, and of course, Roach injects her own brand of humor at just the right times for a little bit of levity. Read this book, even if you have zero interest in military science. It's funny, it's informative, it's just a good read. I found myself reading out whole pages to my husband while we were on a long drive, and now he (almost) wants to read it himself!"
217,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8733987-christina,4,"This was my first experience with Mary Roach. While the topics she chose to research were fascinating, it was her sense of humor and how it blended in to her style of writing, that I could not relate to at the start of the book. I wasn't sure if she was mocking, making light of or was just generally trying to be funny, in regards of the areas she chose to research for this book. For this reason, I spent the first couple of essays a bit pissed off that she could possibly be making light of such a respectful arena. By about the 3rd chapter, I got a feel for her general reverence and then it all just clicked. I'm a believer and I want to get my hands on all that she has to write. Roach has the ability to bring to the light of day, areas of the military that we may never even give a moment of thought about and surely not consider of importance to the bigger picture of soldiers and the theatre of war. So, not only does she look into the nooks and crannies of the American military, she gives credit to ALL of the MEGA-research that goes in to daily operations that one may not even consider. In doing so, Roach helps to bring a shared glory to the Military as a whole, something that I know doesn't happen often enough. I gained a lot of respect for her writing when I made this realization, and I further appreciated the knack she has to make it all so readable. I highly recommend this to any one who has a bit of time to take a little trip through some of the little known and often really weird, areas of military research and operation. "
218,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17379348,4,"This is my first Mary Roach book. I have been meaning to read something of hers for a long time, but when I won an ARC of Grunt, I really had no excuse anymore.So here's the thing. I have a big problem with people who glorify war and who think patriotism excuses despicable acts such as mass murdering. If this book worked for me, it's because it didn't focus on the killing aspect of war, but rather on the surviving. There was no chapter on guns or explosives. In fact, the only weapon mentioned in this book was something called Stench Soup, which was as life-threatening as its name implies.Roach is very funny and relatable, and her curiosity is contagious to the reader. There were certain points in the book when I was not sure what her opinion on war was, or even if she wanted to express one, but that was clarified at the end of the book. Which brings me to my last comment: I really liked the note that the book ended on. I am very particular about endings. Fiction or non-fiction, the way a book ends can make it or break it for me. And by ending, I do not mean the last chapter or even the general resolution. I mean literally the last couple of sentences. Roach, though, wrapped it all up perfectly.To wrap up myself, reading Grunt was an overall very good experience. I laughed, I shuddered, and I learned all kinds of information that I was never meant to know. And when it comes down to it, what more can you ask of a science book?"
219,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2222340-chris,2,"What a disappointment. Grunt it is not. The author's penchant for monosyllabic titles has done her in. Maybe Boom would have been better because this book is not about grunts. The cover has an infantryman with an absurd amount of gear on his back. Yet there is only a page or two about the infantryman and his obscene loads. The subtitle of the book more accurately conveys the substance of this book: the curious science of humans at war. Some areas you would expect some coverage she omitted: woman in combat; NBC defense; biological barrier of flight; vision-we own the night with NVG's and infrared; PTSD; drones and robots; to name a few. What she does cover is two chapters on genital wounds and a long and perhaps irrelevant chapter on stinky things. I enjoyed the chapter on hearing.She was trying to inform and also entertain simultaneously and she didn't pull it off with me. Flippant footnotes in too small a font. Her overly dramatic account of trying to get special operators to talk to her about diarrhea fell flat. This book got rave reviews but it was written by and for the 99 percent of clueless Americans who as the military say ""are at the mall"" while the 1 percent deploy continually in ""endless war."" This book is described as witty, mischievous, fun, and entertaining. Since when has war been that?"
220,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4882193-paul,4,"As with other Mary Roach books I've read, I thoroughly enjoyed this one. And I knew a bit about the subject matter, the military science of keeping soldiers, sailors, and airmen alive, healthy, and at their peak. In my case, it is aviation medicine and physiology. I flew fighters for the USAF, so I know all about altitude chambers, the infamous Nazi experiments of WWII our present-day cold water survival charts are based on, and the improvements we've made over the years in ejection technology. Mary Roach didn't get into the aviation side of military science with this book but she did explore in detail such topics as military clothing, boots, rations, armored vehicle technology, diarrhea and dysentery, the unique injury patterns associated with IEDS and other explosions, submarine escape systems, and sleep management ... critical subjects all, and not often thought of by anyone other than soldiers who have to perform an all kinds of crazy and dangerous environments. Her trademark humor is very much in evidence, and one simply cannot stop turning pages. In case you can't tell, I love Mary Roach and will read anything she writes."
221,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2505581-gary-brecht,3,"A book definitely not for the squeamish, author, Mary Roach, pulls back the curtain to peek at the efforts of our military to protect and patch up our combat soldiers. The reader is given a tour of a wide variety of military units that specialize in such things as testing protective clothing and gear; training submariners to survive a sunken submarine. She introduces us to surgeons who must deal with the physical and psychological consequences of lost limbs. We discover that there is an ongoing analysis of combat deaths where experts examine the remains of fallen soldiers in an effort to learn ways to prevent future lethal incidents. Throughout the book Roach’s dry wit acts as a relief valve for the otherwise serious content. When all is said and done about the heroic efforts of these support units, one still marvels at how cavalierly our leaders commit our youth to war."
222,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17367460-jim-angstadt,4,"GruntMary RoachAnother fast, fun, satisfying read from Mary Roach. The title is a little misleading. One might suspect that this book is about the military in general, or the army in particular. But, really, it is about numerous often overlooked areas of military operations, namely, clothing, vehicle design, genital surgery, staying focused during chaos, diarrhea, bug control, smelliness, sleep deprivation, and more.The author brings out the science behind these topics, and in the process, illuminates many talented, committed, generous, behind the scenes personnel - doctors, scientists, lab workers, staff - who are doing very good work."
223,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8734097-p-d,4,"As always, Roach's books are a delight to read because they ask questions we wouldn't think of asking. When you're told to come up with the main challenges facing a modern soldier, you probably aren't going to name sleep deprivation, diarrhea, or hearing loss right away. She does mention right away that she isn't here to politicize anything, and that she is deliberately not going into PTSD/mental health because there are whole books that do a great job with the topic—but this shouldn't be too surprising as her writing has been consistently quirky, interested in the perspectives without judging them."

Thankfully, Roach has gone before and asked the awkward questions. Yeah, new weapons and planes and ships have to be developed, I knew about those enormous contracts.. But also someone has to work out all the other stuff: what things do people really need to carry? what’s the best way to keep people alive? What makes a weapon ideal?

She took a quite cavalier and breezy approach to the military, improvements in military technology to prevent horrifying death, and military spending. Only the very last sentence of the book addressed this at all. The chapters also seemed less coherent then usual, covering the army, the navy, genital reconstructive surgery, a shark project from the 1940s, among other subjects, and not adding up to a general picture."

She also does the best descriptions of people. I'd love to find a way for her to interview me about something, just so that I can read how she chooses to describe me.I love what she's doing for science writing and as always, I would happily recommend this to anyone who thinks they don't enjoy nonfiction or someone who finds science writing intimidating."

I never would have thought I would enjoy a non fiction book about science...let alone one involving the military. But she has this way of making the most complicated subjects approachable, and so, so fascinating. Roach gives readers a glimpse at the science and humanity behind the people who go to war, instead of the war itself. I just love her to pieces. In fact, I may be developing a bit of a nerdy girl crush on her. #noshame."
228,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53176851-mrs-europaea,4,So interesting to read about the science of war. Mary Roach has a wonderful way of making hard subjects appeal to an average reader and she did this wonderfully in Grunt.

234,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2007216-peter-derk,4,"Great. Like always. Mary Roach, self-described ""goober with a flashlight"" delivers. Some jerkoff in The New Yorker felt like there were too many jokes in this book, or that Roach's formula failed her this time. If you don't already know how I feel about that review (I DID just call the reviewer a jerkoff), then I'll clarify: that person's kind of a jerkoff.Seemed to me they were all put off because it seems like Mary Roach is having a laugh at the expense of soldiers, which A) isn't true and B) means we were cool having a laugh at astronauts and cadavers in Roach's previous books, and those folks are pretty brave, important, and exposed if you ask me.I thought the critique was especially weird because this book, of all of Roach's I read, finished on a very sweet, thoughtful note. Well, I thought the critique was weird until I remember it was a book critic, so the person probably didn't even read the damn thing.And you know what? If you don't see humor in the idea of stink bombs, this clearly isn't the book for you. Nor is this the Earth for you. Because there is A LOT of smelly shit hanging around here, and some of it's pretty comical. "
235,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6085797-elise,4,"In her typical hilarious style, in this book Mary Roach tackles the science of war. Not the science that will kill the most people on the opposing side, but the one that will keep the most people on this side alive. She participates in a training session for medics in the middle of a battlefield, visits a base in Africa and goes around the mess hall asking about diarrhea, visits a submarine carrying nuclear warheads... all with humour and the greatest respect for what she's describing. Always with the funny anecdotes that will make you literally laugh out loud while you're reading.As in the other two books I read by her, I loved the construction of this one, how each chapter neatly segued into the next one. And the conclusion was lovely, the last sentence was perfect."
236,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1205220-matt,3,"I'm the arrogant sort of person who when I rate a book think that there is some objective element to my rating, and that I'm not merely rating how much I personally enjoyed the book, but also on some level how worthy the book is of enjoyment and how much quality was exercised in the crafting of the book from the level of the individual sentence on up to its grand conceptions and story arc. You might say that in rating a book, my expectation is that everyone else will enjoy the book to within +/- a star of what I rated it, depending on how much the material personally appealed to you and how much - for whatever reasons - you were willing to overlook the books evident flaws. Otherwise, if I did not in fact believe this, whatever would be the reason for rating a book, for if my rating was wholly subjective it would do you no good whatsoever. Mary Roach's book ""Grunt: The Curious Science of Humans at War"" and similar books challenge those presumptions somewhat, in that I don't think a simple one dimensional rating system can in this case predict how much the book will be enjoyed. While for me the book was largely, ""Meh"" and parts of it were grating, that's because the book is pitched at a target audience that just falls outside of anything that would be a sweet spot for me.What's Roach is writing is essentially a primer on basic science and engineering, organized around one of the most interesting fields of basic research in the world today - America's high tech war machine. In an academic world too often focused more on publishing results than doing good work, much less doing anything hard and then managing to repeat it, the Defense Department could care less about how much you publish or where you publish, just so long as you give them tangible solutions. It's research wing DARPA is continually at the forefront of progress. Yet for all this, it's also not just interested in fighting the next war, but also the next and the next, and so very interested in the basic research that may lead to great advances way down the line.Roach approaches this material from a welcome angle, of looking at the less glamorous less macho programs that aim not to create better means of killing people, but rather solve other equally important basic problems of being human in a battlefield environment. For most of human history, man versus nature was still more lethal and more important on a battlefield than the other tribe with its weapons trying to kill you. Infection, disease, starvation, and exposure to the environment killed more men on most military campaigns than the battles did. Roach puts a lens on the modern Defense department's continuing research into keeping soldiers physically and mentally fit during the hardships and horrors of war, and she does so with a self-deprecating, rapier wit and an outsider's eye for the unusual, the bizarre, and details others might miss.It could be the making of a book I really enjoy, but the basic problem here is - I already know most of the stuff she covers. For me, the book would have been more interesting had it been taken in one of two directions. Either it would have been more enjoyable for me to focus less on the science, and more on the persons involved in the science and the interesting characters she discovers along the way and the anecdotes about them. This is information I don't have, and some of the biographies she uncovers are interesting in their own right - but she doesn't ever go into these people in any great depth, relying instead on deft caricature to set the stage like a comic book artist or a good Game Master. On the other hand, when she delves into the actual science and engineering, I occasionally discovered something I didn't know before, but then all too quickly she was plowing on to some other topic or providing some basic exposition of another fundamental aspect of the science or engineering problem being discussed. As a result, she never actually went into any one subject with the depth I would have liked.And all this time she's trying to be a comedian as well, with varying degree of success. Personally, as a near autistic, many of her wry asides just struck me as being mean spirited. She had enough empathy for her audience that I didn't feel like she was treating the reader to a tour through a carnival freak show - ""Come see the geeks"" - but at times I did feel like she felt her desired audience wouldn't understand her empathy, and she still needed to convince them that she wasn't one of the nerds and that she certainly didn't approve of this whole military thing so that she'll still get invited to parties with the right sort of people in SF. That is to say, some of the humor seemed a bit jarring and out of place, like she was two people - one admiring interviewer and the other hidden one that was laughing at who she was interviewing -and she was better when her asides and jokes were humble.In short, I'm convinced that for the right sort of person who has never even thought of these sort of things, and who enjoys science even if they don't practice it themselves, or has a narrow field of view and hasn't looked much at the big picture this is a five star book. Mrs. Roach has in effect here done admirable journalism and investigation, and turned obscure but important areas of endeavor into a readable funny work suitable for wide consumption. Despite the three stars, I strongly recommend this book to anyone who doesn't have any interest in the military, or whose interest in either science or the military has been at most casual."
237,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/136066-casey,4,"It's best to approach most Mary Roach books as collections of essays based on a common topic. This isn't my first rodeo with her (can you write about rodeos next, Mary? I won't take a fee for that suggestion), so I knew this would be all over the place. However, I didn't predict just how expansive a topic military science would be. While I anticipated chapters on topics like sleep deprivation, I can honestly say that I knew nothing of penile reconstruction before this. Now I (and whoever read over my shoulder on the subway) know a whole lot! Seriously fascinating stuff, as always."

242,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4272284-kristina,4,"Mary Roach makes science fun. I mean, I think science is fun anyway, but she makes it accessible for non-scientists and she makes it practical. Grunt: The Curious Science of Humans At War is her latest book and I enjoyed it very much. Once again, she tackles scientific topics no one else would think to address and she does it with curiosity, respect, humor and enthusiasm. Grunt explores the science of war and the problems soldiers must deal with (other than the reality of being shot or blown up). After reading these chapters, you realize how much we truly owe our soldiers.I never ever would have thought about military uniforms. Never in a million years. But here’s Roach with a whole chapter about this very topic. Apparently, the fabric of a uniform can affect a soldier’s ability to fight well. That seems like common sense now, but who thinks about this stuff? This is what a modern uniform must do (or come as close as possible): If possible, the army would like to dress its men and women in uniforms that protect them against all that modern warfare has to throw at them: flames, explosives, bullets, lasers, bomb-blasted dirt, blister agents, anthrax, sand fleas. They would like these same uniforms to keep soldiers cool and dry in extreme heat, to stand up to the ruthless rigors of the Army field laundry, to feel good against the skin, to look smart, and to come in under budget. It might be easier to resolve the conflicts in the Middle East (21).She should have added that they be quiet—zippers and buttons and velcro can be noisy and noise can give away a soldier’s position. Extensive testing of fabrics and designs goes on at the US Army Natick Soldier Research, Development and Engineering Center. It’s extremely involved and high-tech. From equipping soldiers with the appropriate clothes to putting them in vehicles that will shield them as much as possible from explosions and gunfire, Roach moves her focus to the human body itself and how the military tries to repair war injuries. Roach being Roach, she doesn’t discuss the usual prosthetics. Why should she? It’s a well-researched topic. No, Mary explores what happens when men have groin damage and their genitals have to be reconstructed. Penis transplants are also now possible. Roach witnessed the procedure (done on cadavers only) and said that by the time the book is published, the first ever penis transplant may have occurred. This chapter was kind of gross, but also very interesting. Roach discusses the possible psychological problems these transplants may cause.The problems of diarrhea, the helpfulness of maggots, and the strain of heat exhaustion are all topics covered in more detail than you may care for, but that’s Mary Roach—she doesn’t leave anything out. The chapters dealing with life in submarines was the most interesting for me, probably due to the lasting impressions the movie The Abyss had on me. I first saw that movie years ago and to do this day I’ve been fascinated with the idea of submarines and the perils of underwater living. It’s also a kick ass movie and I highly recommend it; it vividly shows the consequences of sea water pressure on mechanical objects. Mary Roach is a delight. Her self-deprecating humor and willingness to be a human guinea pig whenever asked (seriously, read her book Bonk. She does not embarrass easily) makes her science books fun to read. She asks the questions you would be reluctant to ask (even if it occurred to you to ask them) and she enthusiastically pursues the answers. If you’re interested in science, read her books. Even if you’re not interested, read her books. I think Mary Roach’s books should be read by high school students so they can understand that science has very real and practical uses. Plus, they will realize that it’s fun."
243,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4361541-barb-middleton,4,"Every time I sit down to write this review, I struggle with the right words and can't help but feel like a ""goober"" myself. Journalist Mary Roach has a terrific voice that makes this science piece easy-to-read and while I laughed, for the most part, there were other times when it was too much. I am glad I read it after, ""The Pentagon's Brain: An Uncensored History of DARPA, America's Top-Secret Military Research Agency"" by Annie Jacobsen because it gave me some historical context that is lacking in Roach's book. Roach is upfront about not specializing in history or science, ""I'm the goober with the flashlight, stumbling into corners and crannies..."" Parts of her story were interesting, others not, and the end definitely abrupt; however, I appreciate the attempt to create characters that are easily visualized. Although even that got repetitive at times. The book doesn't quite nail it, but it is worth reading if you want to know about the side of the military that gets little press such as fabric design for combat, blast wounds, medic training, hearing loss, types of repellents, phalloplasty, and diarrhea to name a few. Her self-deprecating humor and figurative language add to the light tone and great voice. She pokes fun at her lack of knowledge throughout such as thinking that a mechanic's tattoo of pistons are martial arts weapons because of his fierce appearance. On a ship, she makes the mistake of identifying rifle holders as cup holders. She creates characters through detailed descriptions that I liked but became somewhat repetitious, particularly at the start. It seemed most people were gorgeous, adorable, or muscular: ""She is gorgeous, articulate, fast-moving, powerful. Lesser humans left blinking in her wake"" or ""...with a superhero jaw and muscles so big that when he walks in front of the slide projector, entire images can be viewed on his forearm"" or "" you wouldn't use the word distinguished but adorable."" Another officer is ""droll"" and ""adorable"". Even the maggots are ""adorable"" as ""they move like inchworms, like something you might see humping along the pages of a children's book."" That image gave me pause. Here's another one, ""His incisors touch down on his lower lip like children jumping on a bed."" No adorable, but an interesting simile. A fun made-up word is, ""The whole business is straight off my fathometer."" Sometimes she kapow's the reader with phrases that hide her lack of depth on a topic. Other times the book has a seriousness and poignancy that is insightful. She admires the bonding of soldiers and selflessness that defies reason. A man that lost both legs was more concerned about his fellow soldiers being okay than the fact he'd just stepped on an IED. Or how another soldier lost his limbs but said the worst part was losing his hearing because it made it so difficult to communicate with his wife and children. Or the part about how much the government spent millions on shark repellent based on one man's experience and another's political connections. She nails it sometimes and misses the mark at others. And the chapters are connected in a loose manner. As a journalism major, I enjoyed and admired how Mary Roach wrote this piece. She tackles many different topics and perhaps this is the downfall. It might have been better if she had focused on fewer. If you are looking for something historical or scientific then you might want to pair this with another book. "
244,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1345046-todd-martin,3,"Grunt is Mary Roach’s latest book in which she examines technologies associated with  The Curious Science of Humans at War. Well, not really ‘war’ per se, her approach is to focus on technologies involved in keeping soldiers alive and comfortable while minimizing any discussion of weapons, killing or the subject of war itself. This is rather a fine line to tread since the purpose of keeping soldiers alive and comfortable is so that they can do their job (which often involves the use of lethal weapons to end human life), but Roach is known for writing about quirky science topics in an off-beat and humorous way, and the act of creating a fist sized-hole in a human body with a high velocity rifle round isn’t a subject that naturally lends itself to hilarity. Roach is also flirting with a topic fraught with controversy (the bloated US military budget, politicians pork barrel spending, US foreign policy, the national debt, unilateralism, torture, wars of choice, terrorism, drone strikes, civilian casualties, friendly fire, war crimes, the military industrial complex, the treatment of veterans, suicide rates, the conflict in the Middle East and on and on). Her approach is to desperately seek subjects that provide a safe haven so as to avoid any possibly of providing offense (while still managing to work excrement and genitalia into the conversation … obviously). Thus she has chosen to discuss such minutia as: the fabrics and fasteners used in military garments, vehicle armor, hearing protection, penis reconstruction surgery, dysentery remedies, heat exhaustion, sleep deprivation, and others. It’s not that these topics are unimportant (the clothes worn by a soldier while patrolling in a brutally hot desert environment certainly play a role in their comfort, safety and effectiveness), but by focusing on individuals who sweat the small stuff, she’s making a conscious decision to willfully ignore the big stuff. I'll also point out that, other than her coverage of submarine rescues, the remaining topics apply just as much to civilians as they do to the military. Roach is also extremely careful in her use of humor in the book, restricting it mainly to that of self-deprecation. A typical example follows the formula:Roach: Oh look, these uniforms have such cute pockets. They’d be perfect for carrying accessories like my bedazzler or a fresh banana. Military Personnel: That’s magazine holster for an M16A2 assault rifle ma’am.{Cue the trombone}: Wah - wah - waaaah.Given the carefully contrived scope of the book, I would characterize the restricted list of topics discussed as modestly interesting. But after having read most of Roach’s other work I feel like her ‘unflinching glimpse into salacious topics’ style has crossed over into the realm of self-parody. Enough already with the preternatural preoccupation with pee-pee, ca-ca, and the orifices from which these substances emerge."
245,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51152697-kate,4,"This is a book about military science: the study of those things that might affect personnel in combat.he author has a reasonable sense of humor which is much like the military and black humor I am used too. In several places I laughed out loud, as when someone heard a rumor that red fabric had cooling properties. The Army decide to test this in the Philippines and had red under ware designed and ordered and red hat liners...they were anything but cool and the men sweated in places no one wants to sweat, and the red dye ran when wet down into the men's nether parts staining them much to the humor of the control group who wore white under garments. This was 1908 and the services were still on a learning curve.It covers everthing from uniform design, specifications for buttons, why zippers don't work special needs of snipers in gear requirements. How cloth is selected and engineered to wick moisture, retain body heat or allow cooling in hot desert climates. Uniform design: although it didn't mention helmet design which I have been told has been responsible for some of the serious facial burns in IE explosions. The research on the amount of water needed in desert conditions when soldiers burdened with a hundred ponds of gear, armour, supplies and munitions have to expend energy in day time heat of 120-135o. It also covers how the body beaks down when too much water is consumed.Of course it addresses the gigantic toll of intestinal distress from contaminated food, flies and sand tics, and the research that was started during the Spanish American war up to present.Studies and testing to properly armour up vehicles, how to protect bodies within vehicles from the tremendous bone shattering concussions. Much other research is cover in sections, how to prepare Medics to cope with the carnage of the injuries caused by modern weapons.Very interesting book, having family members that have worked in procurement, a son who was a Medical Officer in serving in theater I was familiar with some of the things covered, and the complaints of those who did not want one more piece of protective gear to weight them down or obstruct their movement. A good read for anyone not familiar with what many of the military research teams deal with."
246,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1462387-karyl,5,"Mary Roach is like that little precocious kid that always asks, ""But WHY?!"" I don't think she ever grew out of that stage, and that is lucky for us. She has so many questions to satisfy her curiosity about literally everything, and it's that which fuels her books. I knew I was going to enjoy this book, simply because she wrote it, but it's even more amusing yet fascinating than even I had imagined!I'm glad that Mary Roach didn't go into the normal things you think of when you think of war -- things like guns, or bombs, or IEDs. Instead we look at the fabrics the military uses in its uniforms (I am rather glad I was ignorant of how easily flame retardancy washes out of fabric after my husband finished out all his years at sea, since his favorite coveralls were about as old as some of the guys under him), keeping troops safe when driving through dangerous areas (who knew they'd have to completely redesign the crash test dummy for upward impacts?!), hearing loss (something I'm quite familiar with, since my husband spent the last 23 years in the engine room of various warships), what happens when a guy gets shot in the junk, even how to keep troops free of diarrhea in the field. There is so much in this book that the average person just has never thought of in regards to military science, and of course, Roach injects her own brand of humor at just the right times for a little bit of levity. Read this book, even if you have zero interest in military science. It's funny, it's informative, it's just a good read. I found myself reading out whole pages to my husband while we were on a long drive, and now he (almost) wants to read it himself!"
247,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8733987-christina,4,"This was my first experience with Mary Roach. While the topics she chose to research were fascinating, it was her sense of humor and how it blended in to her style of writing, that I could not relate to at the start of the book. I wasn't sure if she was mocking, making light of or was just generally trying to be funny, in regards of the areas she chose to research for this book. For this reason, I spent the first couple of essays a bit pissed off that she could possibly be making light of such a respectful arena. By about the 3rd chapter, I got a feel for her general reverence and then it all just clicked. I'm a believer and I want to get my hands on all that she has to write. Roach has the ability to bring to the light of day, areas of the military that we may never even give a moment of thought about and surely not consider of importance to the bigger picture of soldiers and the theatre of war. So, not only does she look into the nooks and crannies of the American military, she gives credit to ALL of the MEGA-research that goes in to daily operations that one may not even consider. In doing so, Roach helps to bring a shared glory to the Military as a whole, something that I know doesn't happen often enough. I gained a lot of respect for her writing when I made this realization, and I further appreciated the knack she has to make it all so readable. I highly recommend this to any one who has a bit of time to take a little trip through some of the little known and often really weird, areas of military research and operation. "
248,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17379348,4,"This is my first Mary Roach book. I have been meaning to read something of hers for a long time, but when I won an ARC of Grunt, I really had no excuse anymore.So here's the thing. I have a big problem with people who glorify war and who think patriotism excuses despicable acts such as mass murdering. If this book worked for me, it's because it didn't focus on the killing aspect of war, but rather on the surviving. There was no chapter on guns or explosives. In fact, the only weapon mentioned in this book was something called Stench Soup, which was as life-threatening as its name implies.Roach is very funny and relatable, and her curiosity is contagious to the reader. There were certain points in the book when I was not sure what her opinion on war was, or even if she wanted to express one, but that was clarified at the end of the book. Which brings me to my last comment: I really liked the note that the book ended on. I am very particular about endings. Fiction or non-fiction, the way a book ends can make it or break it for me. And by ending, I do not mean the last chapter or even the general resolution. I mean literally the last couple of sentences. Roach, though, wrapped it all up perfectly.To wrap up myself, reading Grunt was an overall very good experience. I laughed, I shuddered, and I learned all kinds of information that I was never meant to know. And when it comes down to it, what more can you ask of a science book?"
249,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2222340-chris,2,"What a disappointment. Grunt it is not. The author's penchant for monosyllabic titles has done her in. Maybe Boom would have been better because this book is not about grunts. The cover has an infantryman with an absurd amount of gear on his back. Yet there is only a page or two about the infantryman and his obscene loads. The subtitle of the book more accurately conveys the substance of this book: the curious science of humans at war. Some areas you would expect some coverage she omitted: woman in combat; NBC defense; biological barrier of flight; vision-we own the night with NVG's and infrared; PTSD; drones and robots; to name a few. What she does cover is two chapters on genital wounds and a long and perhaps irrelevant chapter on stinky things. I enjoyed the chapter on hearing.She was trying to inform and also entertain simultaneously and she didn't pull it off with me. Flippant footnotes in too small a font. Her overly dramatic account of trying to get special operators to talk to her about diarrhea fell flat. This book got rave reviews but it was written by and for the 99 percent of clueless Americans who as the military say ""are at the mall"" while the 1 percent deploy continually in ""endless war."" This book is described as witty, mischievous, fun, and entertaining. Since when has war been that?"
250,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4882193-paul,4,"As with other Mary Roach books I've read, I thoroughly enjoyed this one. And I knew a bit about the subject matter, the military science of keeping soldiers, sailors, and airmen alive, healthy, and at their peak. In my case, it is aviation medicine and physiology. I flew fighters for the USAF, so I know all about altitude chambers, the infamous Nazi experiments of WWII our present-day cold water survival charts are based on, and the improvements we've made over the years in ejection technology. Mary Roach didn't get into the aviation side of military science with this book but she did explore in detail such topics as military clothing, boots, rations, armored vehicle technology, diarrhea and dysentery, the unique injury patterns associated with IEDS and other explosions, submarine escape systems, and sleep management ... critical subjects all, and not often thought of by anyone other than soldiers who have to perform an all kinds of crazy and dangerous environments. Her trademark humor is very much in evidence, and one simply cannot stop turning pages. In case you can't tell, I love Mary Roach and will read anything she writes."
251,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2505581-gary-brecht,3,"A book definitely not for the squeamish, author, Mary Roach, pulls back the curtain to peek at the efforts of our military to protect and patch up our combat soldiers. The reader is given a tour of a wide variety of military units that specialize in such things as testing protective clothing and gear; training submariners to survive a sunken submarine. She introduces us to surgeons who must deal with the physical and psychological consequences of lost limbs. We discover that there is an ongoing analysis of combat deaths where experts examine the remains of fallen soldiers in an effort to learn ways to prevent future lethal incidents. Throughout the book Roach’s dry wit acts as a relief valve for the otherwise serious content. When all is said and done about the heroic efforts of these support units, one still marvels at how cavalierly our leaders commit our youth to war."
252,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17367460-jim-angstadt,4,"GruntMary RoachAnother fast, fun, satisfying read from Mary Roach. The title is a little misleading. One might suspect that this book is about the military in general, or the army in particular. But, really, it is about numerous often overlooked areas of military operations, namely, clothing, vehicle design, genital surgery, staying focused during chaos, diarrhea, bug control, smelliness, sleep deprivation, and more.The author brings out the science behind these topics, and in the process, illuminates many talented, committed, generous, behind the scenes personnel - doctors, scientists, lab workers, staff - who are doing very good work."
253,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8734097-p-d,4,"As always, Roach's books are a delight to read because they ask questions we wouldn't think of asking. When you're told to come up with the main challenges facing a modern soldier, you probably aren't going to name sleep deprivation, diarrhea, or hearing loss right away. She does mention right away that she isn't here to politicize anything, and that she is deliberately not going into PTSD/mental health because there are whole books that do a great job with the topic—but this shouldn't be too surprising as her writing has been consistently quirky, interested in the perspectives without judging them."

Thankfully, Roach has gone before and asked the awkward questions. Yeah, new weapons and planes and ships have to be developed, I knew about those enormous contracts.. But also someone has to work out all the other stuff: what things do people really need to carry? what’s the best way to keep people alive? What makes a weapon ideal? Roach is out there following her curiousity to places I never considered, and arousing mine.Library copy"
255,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4070288-jo,3,"I love Mary Roach, and her usual interesting facts and humor are on display in this book, but the tone did not match the material as well as it usually does. She took a quite cavalier and breezy approach to the military, improvements in military technology to prevent horrifying death, and military spending. Only the very last sentence of the book addressed this at all. The chapters also seemed less coherent then usual, covering the army, the navy, genital reconstructive surgery, a shark project from the 1940s, among other subjects, and not adding up to a general picture."

This book took me places I did not expect to go and I now know something about genital reconstruction and a lot more about poop. Mary makes me a more interesting person. She also does the best descriptions of people. I'd love to find a way for her to interview me about something, just so that I can read how she chooses to describe me.I love what she's doing for science writing and as always, I would happily recommend this to anyone who thinks they don't enjoy nonfiction or someone who finds science writing intimidating."

I never would have thought I would enjoy a non fiction book about science...let alone one involving the military. But she has this way of making the most complicated subjects approachable, and so, so fascinating. Roach gives readers a glimpse at the science and humanity behind the people who go to war, instead of the war itself. I just love her to pieces. In fact, I may be developing a bit of a nerdy girl crush on her. #noshame."
258,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53176851-mrs-europaea,4,So interesting to read about the science of war. Mary Roach has a wonderful way of making hard subjects appeal to an average reader and she did this wonderfully in Grunt. Her dry humor and awkwardness makes what could be boring and wordy entertaining without discrediting the hard work of Service members or scientists.

The anecdotes and information are intriguing, but they're brought to us without any meaningful order, quite disjointedly in fact, and they don't add up to any deeper insight about military life or war, which makes them meaningless.

264,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2007216-peter-derk,4,"Great. Like always. Mary Roach, self-described ""goober with a flashlight"" delivers. Some jerkoff in The New Yorker felt like there were too many jokes in this book, or that Roach's formula failed her this time. If you don't already know how I feel about that review (I DID just call the reviewer a jerkoff), then I'll clarify: that person's kind of a jerkoff.Seemed to me they were all put off because it seems like Mary Roach is having a laugh at the expense of soldiers, which A) isn't true and B) means we were cool having a laugh at astronauts and cadavers in Roach's previous books, and those folks are pretty brave, important, and exposed if you ask me.I thought the critique was especially weird because this book, of all of Roach's I read, finished on a very sweet, thoughtful note. Well, I thought the critique was weird until I remember it was a book critic, so the person probably didn't even read the damn thing.And you know what? If you don't see humor in the idea of stink bombs, this clearly isn't the book for you. Nor is this the Earth for you. Because there is A LOT of smelly shit hanging around here, and some of it's pretty comical. "
265,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6085797-elise,4,"In her typical hilarious style, in this book Mary Roach tackles the science of war. Not the science that will kill the most people on the opposing side, but the one that will keep the most people on this side alive. She participates in a training session for medics in the middle of a battlefield, visits a base in Africa and goes around the mess hall asking about diarrhea, visits a submarine carrying nuclear warheads... all with humour and the greatest respect for what she's describing. Always with the funny anecdotes that will make you literally laugh out loud while you're reading.As in the other two books I read by her, I loved the construction of this one, how each chapter neatly segued into the next one. And the conclusion was lovely, the last sentence was perfect."
266,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1205220-matt,3,"I'm the arrogant sort of person who when I rate a book think that there is some objective element to my rating, and that I'm not merely rating how much I personally enjoyed the book, but also on some level how worthy the book is of enjoyment and how much quality was exercised in the crafting of the book from the level of the individual sentence on up to its grand conceptions and story arc. You might say that in rating a book, my expectation is that everyone else will enjoy the book to within +/- a star of what I rated it, depending on how much the material personally appealed to you and how much - for whatever reasons - you were willing to overlook the books evident flaws. Otherwise, if I did not in fact believe this, whatever would be the reason for rating a book, for if my rating was wholly subjective it would do you no good whatsoever. Mary Roach's book ""Grunt: The Curious Science of Humans at War"" and similar books challenge those presumptions somewhat, in that I don't think a simple one dimensional rating system can in this case predict how much the book will be enjoyed. While for me the book was largely, ""Meh"" and parts of it were grating, that's because the book is pitched at a target audience that just falls outside of anything that would be a sweet spot for me.What's Roach is writing is essentially a primer on basic science and engineering, organized around one of the most interesting fields of basic research in the world today - America's high tech war machine. In an academic world too often focused more on publishing results than doing good work, much less doing anything hard and then managing to repeat it, the Defense Department could care less about how much you publish or where you publish, just so long as you give them tangible solutions. It's research wing DARPA is continually at the forefront of progress. Yet for all this, it's also not just interested in fighting the next war, but also the next and the next, and so very interested in the basic research that may lead to great advances way down the line.Roach approaches this material from a welcome angle, of looking at the less glamorous less macho programs that aim not to create better means of killing people, but rather solve other equally important basic problems of being human in a battlefield environment. For most of human history, man versus nature was still more lethal and more important on a battlefield than the other tribe with its weapons trying to kill you. Infection, disease, starvation, and exposure to the environment killed more men on most military campaigns than the battles did. Roach puts a lens on the modern Defense department's continuing research into keeping soldiers physically and mentally fit during the hardships and horrors of war, and she does so with a self-deprecating, rapier wit and an outsider's eye for the unusual, the bizarre, and details others might miss.It could be the making of a book I really enjoy, but the basic problem here is - I already know most of the stuff she covers. For me, the book would have been more interesting had it been taken in one of two directions. Either it would have been more enjoyable for me to focus less on the science, and more on the persons involved in the science and the interesting characters she discovers along the way and the anecdotes about them. This is information I don't have, and some of the biographies she uncovers are interesting in their own right - but she doesn't ever go into these people in any great depth, relying instead on deft caricature to set the stage like a comic book artist or a good Game Master. On the other hand, when she delves into the actual science and engineering, I occasionally discovered something I didn't know before, but then all too quickly she was plowing on to some other topic or providing some basic exposition of another fundamental aspect of the science or engineering problem being discussed. As a result, she never actually went into any one subject with the depth I would have liked.And all this time she's trying to be a comedian as well, with varying degree of success. Personally, as a near autistic, many of her wry asides just struck me as being mean spirited. She had enough empathy for her audience that I didn't feel like she was treating the reader to a tour through a carnival freak show - ""Come see the geeks"" - but at times I did feel like she felt her desired audience wouldn't understand her empathy, and she still needed to convince them that she wasn't one of the nerds and that she certainly didn't approve of this whole military thing so that she'll still get invited to parties with the right sort of people in SF. That is to say, some of the humor seemed a bit jarring and out of place, like she was two people - one admiring interviewer and the other hidden one that was laughing at who she was interviewing -and she was better when her asides and jokes were humble.In short, I'm convinced that for the right sort of person who has never even thought of these sort of things, and who enjoys science even if they don't practice it themselves, or has a narrow field of view and hasn't looked much at the big picture this is a five star book. Mrs. Roach has in effect here done admirable journalism and investigation, and turned obscure but important areas of endeavor into a readable funny work suitable for wide consumption. Despite the three stars, I strongly recommend this book to anyone who doesn't have any interest in the military, or whose interest in either science or the military has been at most casual."
267,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/136066-casey,4,"It's best to approach most Mary Roach books as collections of essays based on a common topic. This isn't my first rodeo with her (can you write about rodeos next, Mary? I won't take a fee for that suggestion), so I knew this would be all over the place. However, I didn't predict just how expansive a topic military science would be. While I anticipated chapters on topics like sleep deprivation, I can honestly say that I knew nothing of penile reconstruction before this. Now I (and whoever read over my shoulder on the subway) know a whole lot! Seriously fascinating stuff, as always."

272,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4272284-kristina,4,"Mary Roach makes science fun. I mean, I think science is fun anyway, but she makes it accessible for non-scientists and she makes it practical. Grunt: The Curious Science of Humans At War is her latest book and I enjoyed it very much. Once again, she tackles scientific topics no one else would think to address and she does it with curiosity, respect, humor and enthusiasm. Grunt explores the science of war and the problems soldiers must deal with (other than the reality of being shot or blown up). After reading these chapters, you realize how much we truly owe our soldiers.I never ever would have thought about military uniforms. Never in a million years. But here’s Roach with a whole chapter about this very topic. Apparently, the fabric of a uniform can affect a soldier’s ability to fight well. That seems like common sense now, but who thinks about this stuff? This is what a modern uniform must do (or come as close as possible): If possible, the army would like to dress its men and women in uniforms that protect them against all that modern warfare has to throw at them: flames, explosives, bullets, lasers, bomb-blasted dirt, blister agents, anthrax, sand fleas. They would like these same uniforms to keep soldiers cool and dry in extreme heat, to stand up to the ruthless rigors of the Army field laundry, to feel good against the skin, to look smart, and to come in under budget. It might be easier to resolve the conflicts in the Middle East (21).She should have added that they be quiet—zippers and buttons and velcro can be noisy and noise can give away a soldier’s position. Extensive testing of fabrics and designs goes on at the US Army Natick Soldier Research, Development and Engineering Center. It’s extremely involved and high-tech. From equipping soldiers with the appropriate clothes to putting them in vehicles that will shield them as much as possible from explosions and gunfire, Roach moves her focus to the human body itself and how the military tries to repair war injuries. Roach being Roach, she doesn’t discuss the usual prosthetics. Why should she? It’s a well-researched topic. No, Mary explores what happens when men have groin damage and their genitals have to be reconstructed. Penis transplants are also now possible. Roach witnessed the procedure (done on cadavers only) and said that by the time the book is published, the first ever penis transplant may have occurred. This chapter was kind of gross, but also very interesting. Roach discusses the possible psychological problems these transplants may cause.The problems of diarrhea, the helpfulness of maggots, and the strain of heat exhaustion are all topics covered in more detail than you may care for, but that’s Mary Roach—she doesn’t leave anything out. The chapters dealing with life in submarines was the most interesting for me, probably due to the lasting impressions the movie The Abyss had on me. I first saw that movie years ago and to do this day I’ve been fascinated with the idea of submarines and the perils of underwater living. It’s also a kick ass movie and I highly recommend it; it vividly shows the consequences of sea water pressure on mechanical objects. Mary Roach is a delight. Her self-deprecating humor and willingness to be a human guinea pig whenever asked (seriously, read her book Bonk. She does not embarrass easily) makes her science books fun to read. She asks the questions you would be reluctant to ask (even if it occurred to you to ask them) and she enthusiastically pursues the answers. If you’re interested in science, read her books. Even if you’re not interested, read her books. I think Mary Roach’s books should be read by high school students so they can understand that science has very real and practical uses. Plus, they will realize that it’s fun."
273,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4361541-barb-middleton,4,"Every time I sit down to write this review, I struggle with the right words and can't help but feel like a ""goober"" myself. Journalist Mary Roach has a terrific voice that makes this science piece easy-to-read and while I laughed, for the most part, there were other times when it was too much. I am glad I read it after, ""The Pentagon's Brain: An Uncensored History of DARPA, America's Top-Secret Military Research Agency"" by Annie Jacobsen because it gave me some historical context that is lacking in Roach's book. Roach is upfront about not specializing in history or science, ""I'm the goober with the flashlight, stumbling into corners and crannies..."" Parts of her story were interesting, others not, and the end definitely abrupt; however, I appreciate the attempt to create characters that are easily visualized. Although even that got repetitive at times. The book doesn't quite nail it, but it is worth reading if you want to know about the side of the military that gets little press such as fabric design for combat, blast wounds, medic training, hearing loss, types of repellents, phalloplasty, and diarrhea to name a few. Her self-deprecating humor and figurative language add to the light tone and great voice. She pokes fun at her lack of knowledge throughout such as thinking that a mechanic's tattoo of pistons are martial arts weapons because of his fierce appearance. On a ship, she makes the mistake of identifying rifle holders as cup holders. She creates characters through detailed descriptions that I liked but became somewhat repetitious, particularly at the start. It seemed most people were gorgeous, adorable, or muscular: ""She is gorgeous, articulate, fast-moving, powerful. Lesser humans left blinking in her wake"" or ""...with a superhero jaw and muscles so big that when he walks in front of the slide projector, entire images can be viewed on his forearm"" or "" you wouldn't use the word distinguished but adorable."" Another officer is ""droll"" and ""adorable"". Even the maggots are ""adorable"" as ""they move like inchworms, like something you might see humping along the pages of a children's book."" That image gave me pause. Here's another one, ""His incisors touch down on his lower lip like children jumping on a bed."" No adorable, but an interesting simile. A fun made-up word is, ""The whole business is straight off my fathometer."" Sometimes she kapow's the reader with phrases that hide her lack of depth on a topic. Other times the book has a seriousness and poignancy that is insightful. She admires the bonding of soldiers and selflessness that defies reason. A man that lost both legs was more concerned about his fellow soldiers being okay than the fact he'd just stepped on an IED. Or how another soldier lost his limbs but said the worst part was losing his hearing because it made it so difficult to communicate with his wife and children. Or the part about how much the government spent millions on shark repellent based on one man's experience and another's political connections. She nails it sometimes and misses the mark at others. And the chapters are connected in a loose manner. As a journalism major, I enjoyed and admired how Mary Roach wrote this piece. She tackles many different topics and perhaps this is the downfall. It might have been better if she had focused on fewer. If you are looking for something historical or scientific then you might want to pair this with another book. "
274,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1345046-todd-martin,3,"Grunt is Mary Roach’s latest book in which she examines technologies associated with  The Curious Science of Humans at War. Well, not really ‘war’ per se, her approach is to focus on technologies involved in keeping soldiers alive and comfortable while minimizing any discussion of weapons, killing or the subject of war itself. This is rather a fine line to tread since the purpose of keeping soldiers alive and comfortable is so that they can do their job (which often involves the use of lethal weapons to end human life), but Roach is known for writing about quirky science topics in an off-beat and humorous way, and the act of creating a fist sized-hole in a human body with a high velocity rifle round isn’t a subject that naturally lends itself to hilarity. Roach is also flirting with a topic fraught with controversy (the bloated US military budget, politicians pork barrel spending, US foreign policy, the national debt, unilateralism, torture, wars of choice, terrorism, drone strikes, civilian casualties, friendly fire, war crimes, the military industrial complex, the treatment of veterans, suicide rates, the conflict in the Middle East and on and on). Her approach is to desperately seek subjects that provide a safe haven so as to avoid any possibly of providing offense (while still managing to work excrement and genitalia into the conversation … obviously). Thus she has chosen to discuss such minutia as: the fabrics and fasteners used in military garments, vehicle armor, hearing protection, penis reconstruction surgery, dysentery remedies, heat exhaustion, sleep deprivation, and others. It’s not that these topics are unimportant (the clothes worn by a soldier while patrolling in a brutally hot desert environment certainly play a role in their comfort, safety and effectiveness), but by focusing on individuals who sweat the small stuff, she’s making a conscious decision to willfully ignore the big stuff. I'll also point out that, other than her coverage of submarine rescues, the remaining topics apply just as much to civilians as they do to the military. Roach is also extremely careful in her use of humor in the book, restricting it mainly to that of self-deprecation. A typical example follows the formula:Roach: Oh look, these uniforms have such cute pockets. They’d be perfect for carrying accessories like my bedazzler or a fresh banana. Military Personnel: That’s magazine holster for an M16A2 assault rifle ma’am.{Cue the trombone}: Wah - wah - waaaah.Given the carefully contrived scope of the book, I would characterize the restricted list of topics discussed as modestly interesting. But after having read most of Roach’s other work I feel like her ‘unflinching glimpse into salacious topics’ style has crossed over into the realm of self-parody. Enough already with the preternatural preoccupation with pee-pee, ca-ca, and the orifices from which these substances emerge."
275,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51152697-kate,4,"This is a book about military science: the study of those things that might affect personnel in combat.he author has a reasonable sense of humor which is much like the military and black humor I am used too. In several places I laughed out loud, as when someone heard a rumor that red fabric had cooling properties. The Army decide to test this in the Philippines and had red under ware designed and ordered and red hat liners...they were anything but cool and the men sweated in places no one wants to sweat, and the red dye ran when wet down into the men's nether parts staining them much to the humor of the control group who wore white under garments. This was 1908 and the services were still on a learning curve.It covers everthing from uniform design, specifications for buttons, why zippers don't work special needs of snipers in gear requirements. How cloth is selected and engineered to wick moisture, retain body heat or allow cooling in hot desert climates. Uniform design: although it didn't mention helmet design which I have been told has been responsible for some of the serious facial burns in IE explosions. The research on the amount of water needed in desert conditions when soldiers burdened with a hundred ponds of gear, armour, supplies and munitions have to expend energy in day time heat of 120-135o. It also covers how the body beaks down when too much water is consumed.Of course it addresses the gigantic toll of intestinal distress from contaminated food, flies and sand tics, and the research that was started during the Spanish American war up to present.Studies and testing to properly armour up vehicles, how to protect bodies within vehicles from the tremendous bone shattering concussions. Much other research is cover in sections, how to prepare Medics to cope with the carnage of the injuries caused by modern weapons.Very interesting book, having family members that have worked in procurement, a son who was a Medical Officer in serving in theater I was familiar with some of the things covered, and the complaints of those who did not want one more piece of protective gear to weight them down or obstruct their movement. A good read for anyone not familiar with what many of the military research teams deal with."

I don't think she ever grew out of that stage, and that is lucky for us. She has so many questions to satisfy her curiosity about literally everything, and it's that which fuels her books. I knew I was going to enjoy this book, simply because she wrote it, but it's even more amusing yet fascinating than even I had imagined!I'm glad that Mary Roach didn't go into the normal things you think of when you think of war -- things like guns, or bombs, or IEDs. Instead we look at the fabrics the military uses in its uniforms (I am rather glad I was ignorant of how easily flame retardancy washes out of fabric after my husband finished out all his years at sea, since his favorite coveralls were about as old as some of the guys under him), keeping troops safe when driving through dangerous areas (who knew they'd have to completely redesign the crash test dummy for upward impacts?!), hearing loss (something I'm quite familiar with, since my husband spent the last 23 years in the engine room of various warships), what happens when a guy gets shot in the junk, even how to keep troops free of diarrhea in the field. There is so much in this book that the average person just has never thought of in regards to military science, and of course, Roach injects her own brand of humor at just the right times for a little bit of levity. Read this book, even if you have zero interest in military science. It's funny, it's informative, it's just a good read. I found myself reading out whole pages to my husband while we were on a long drive, and now he (almost) wants to read it himself!"
277,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8733987-christina,4,"This was my first experience with Mary Roach. While the topics she chose to research were fascinating, it was her sense of humor and how it blended in to her style of writing, that I could not relate to at the start of the book. I wasn't sure if she was mocking, making light of or was just generally trying to be funny, in regards of the areas she chose to research for this book. For this reason, I spent the first couple of essays a bit pissed off that she could possibly be making light of such a respectful arena. By about the 3rd chapter, I got a feel for her general reverence and then it all just clicked. I'm a believer and I want to get my hands on all that she has to write. Roach has the ability to bring to the light of day, areas of the military that we may never even give a moment of thought about and surely not consider of importance to the bigger picture of soldiers and the theatre of war. So, not only does she look into the nooks and crannies of the American military, she gives credit to ALL of the MEGA-research that goes in to daily operations that one may not even consider. In doing so, Roach helps to bring a shared glory to the Military as a whole, something that I know doesn't happen often enough. I gained a lot of respect for her writing when I made this realization, and I further appreciated the knack she has to make it all so readable. I highly recommend this to any one who has a bit of time to take a little trip through some of the little known and often really weird, areas of military research and operation. "
278,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17379348,4,"This is my first Mary Roach book. I have been meaning to read something of hers for a long time, but when I won an ARC of Grunt, I really had no excuse anymore.So here's the thing. I have a big problem with people who glorify war and who think patriotism excuses despicable acts such as mass murdering. If this book worked for me, it's because it didn't focus on the killing aspect of war, but rather on the surviving. There was no chapter on guns or explosives. In fact, the only weapon mentioned in this book was something called Stench Soup, which was as life-threatening as its name implies.Roach is very funny and relatable, and her curiosity is contagious to the reader. There were certain points in the book when I was not sure what her opinion on war was, or even if she wanted to express one, but that was clarified at the end of the book. Which brings me to my last comment: I really liked the note that the book ended on. I am very particular about endings. Fiction or non-fiction, the way a book ends can make it or break it for me. And by ending, I do not mean the last chapter or even the general resolution. I mean literally the last couple of sentences. Roach, though, wrapped it all up perfectly.To wrap up myself, reading Grunt was an overall very good experience. I laughed, I shuddered, and I learned all kinds of information that I was never meant to know. And when it comes down to it, what more can you ask of a science book?"
279,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2222340-chris,2,"What a disappointment. Grunt it is not. The author's penchant for monosyllabic titles has done her in. Maybe Boom would have been better because this book is not about grunts. The cover has an infantryman with an absurd amount of gear on his back. Yet there is only a page or two about the infantryman and his obscene loads. The subtitle of the book more accurately conveys the substance of this book: the curious science of humans at war. Some areas you would expect some coverage she omitted: woman in combat; NBC defense; biological barrier of flight; vision-we own the night with NVG's and infrared; PTSD; drones and robots; to name a few. What she does cover is two chapters on genital wounds and a long and perhaps irrelevant chapter on stinky things. I enjoyed the chapter on hearing.She was trying to inform and also entertain simultaneously and she didn't pull it off with me. Flippant footnotes in too small a font. Her overly dramatic account of trying to get special operators to talk to her about diarrhea fell flat. This book got rave reviews but it was written by and for the 99 percent of clueless Americans who as the military say ""are at the mall"" while the 1 percent deploy continually in ""endless war."" This book is described as witty, mischievous, fun, and entertaining. Since when has war been that?"
280,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4882193-paul,4,"As with other Mary Roach books I've read, I thoroughly enjoyed this one. And I knew a bit about the subject matter, the military science of keeping soldiers, sailors, and airmen alive, healthy, and at their peak. In my case, it is aviation medicine and physiology. I flew fighters for the USAF, so I know all about altitude chambers, the infamous Nazi experiments of WWII our present-day cold water survival charts are based on, and the improvements we've made over the years in ejection technology. Mary Roach didn't get into the aviation side of military science with this book but she did explore in detail such topics as military clothing, boots, rations, armored vehicle technology, diarrhea and dysentery, the unique injury patterns associated with IEDS and other explosions, submarine escape systems, and sleep management ... critical subjects all, and not often thought of by anyone other than soldiers who have to perform an all kinds of crazy and dangerous environments. Her trademark humor is very much in evidence, and one simply cannot stop turning pages. In case you can't tell, I love Mary Roach and will read anything she writes."
281,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2505581-gary-brecht,3,"A book definitely not for the squeamish, author, Mary Roach, pulls back the curtain to peek at the efforts of our military to protect and patch up our combat soldiers. The reader is given a tour of a wide variety of military units that specialize in such things as testing protective clothing and gear; training submariners to survive a sunken submarine. She introduces us to surgeons who must deal with the physical and psychological consequences of lost limbs. We discover that there is an ongoing analysis of combat deaths where experts examine the remains of fallen soldiers in an effort to learn ways to prevent future lethal incidents. Throughout the book Roach’s dry wit acts as a relief valve for the otherwise serious content. When all is said and done about the heroic efforts of these support units, one still marvels at how cavalierly our leaders commit our youth to war."
282,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17367460-jim-angstadt,4,"GruntMary RoachAnother fast, fun, satisfying read from Mary Roach. The title is a little misleading. One might suspect that this book is about the military in general, or the army in particular. But, really, it is about numerous often overlooked areas of military operations, namely, clothing, vehicle design, genital surgery, staying focused during chaos, diarrhea, bug control, smelliness, sleep deprivation, and more.The author brings out the science behind these topics, and in the process, illuminates many talented, committed, generous, behind the scenes personnel - doctors, scientists, lab workers, staff - who are doing very good work."
283,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8734097-p-d,4,"As always, Roach's books are a delight to read because they ask questions we wouldn't think of asking. When you're told to come up with the main challenges facing a modern soldier, you probably aren't going to name sleep deprivation, diarrhea, or hearing loss right away. She does mention right away that she isn't here to politicize anything, and that she is deliberately not going into PTSD/mental health because there are whole books that do a great job with the topic—but this shouldn't be too surprising as her writing has been consistently quirky, interested in the perspectives without judging them."
284,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1072582-kaethe-douglas,5,"Grunt: The Curious Science of Humans at War - Mary Roach One morning you wake up and realize you just never thought that much about the stuff of war. Thankfully, Roach has gone before and asked the awkward questions. Yeah, new weapons and planes and ships have to be developed, I knew about those enormous contracts.. But also someone has to work out all the other stuff: what things do people really need to carry? what’s the best way to keep people alive? What makes a weapon ideal? Roach is out there following her curiousity to places I never considered, and arousing mine.Library copy"
285,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4070288-jo,3,"I love Mary Roach, and her usual interesting facts and humor are on display in this book, but the tone did not match the material as well as it usually does. She took a quite cavalier and breezy approach to the military, improvements in military technology to prevent horrifying death, and military spending. Only the very last sentence of the book addressed this at all. The chapters also seemed less coherent then usual, covering the army, the navy, genital reconstructive surgery, a shark project from the 1940s, among other subjects, and not adding up to a general picture."
286,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4802330-heino-colyn,5,"Man, I love Mary Roach. This book took me places I did not expect to go and I now know something about genital reconstruction and a lot more about poop. Mary makes me a more interesting person. She also does the best descriptions of people. I'd love to find a way for her to interview me about something, just so that I can read how she chooses to describe me.I love what she's doing for science writing and as always, I would happily recommend this to anyone who thinks they don't enjoy nonfiction or someone who finds science writing intimidating."
287,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2127955-holly,5,"I  am so thankful I stumbled across Mary Roach. I never would have thought I would enjoy a non fiction book about science...let alone one involving the military. But she has this way of making the most complicated subjects approachable, and so, so fascinating. Roach gives readers a glimpse at the science and humanity behind the people who go to war, instead of the war itself. I just love her to pieces. In fact, I may be developing a bit of a nerdy girl crush on her. #noshame."
288,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53176851-mrs-europaea,4,So interesting to read about the science of war. Mary Roach has a wonderful way of making hard subjects appeal to an average reader and she did this wonderfully in Grunt. Her dry humor and awkwardness makes what could be boring and wordy entertaining without discrediting the hard work of Service members or scientists. 
289,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8101737-peter-tillman,3,"Progress report: Great stuff, but then I came to two chapters on *Genital mutilations* ...Now up to hearing damage. Interesting but not great, and occasionally gross. Roach really likes the gross-out stuff. Not my favorite of her themes.OK, I finished it, more or less. Definitely a mixed bag. I might try it again later, which has worked for me for some of her other books."
290,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43565088-ron-wroblewski,4,"This was a unique book about the military - all behind scenes of attempting to help the field soldiers, sailors and Marines to survive and recover. Some of the facts I already knew - being sleep deprived for instance. Others were knew to me. What impressed me was all the attempts to help the military individuals live better and healthier lives. A good read."
291,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2199883-aditurbo,1,"DNF. Not her best at all. The anecdotes and information are intriguing, but they're brought to us without any meaningful order, quite disjointedly in fact, and they don't add up to any deeper insight about military life or war, which makes them meaningless. "
292,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3388215-megan,4,Really enjoyed this one. Surprisingly fascinating.
293,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/909255-dna,5,I completely loved this book! Can't believe I didn't review it after reading it.
294,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2007216-peter-derk,4,"Great. Like always. Mary Roach, self-described ""goober with a flashlight"" delivers. Some jerkoff in The New Yorker felt like there were too many jokes in this book, or that Roach's formula failed her this time. If you don't already know how I feel about that review (I DID just call the reviewer a jerkoff), then I'll clarify: that person's kind of a jerkoff.Seemed to me they were all put off because it seems like Mary Roach is having a laugh at the expense of soldiers, which A) isn't true and B) means we were cool having a laugh at astronauts and cadavers in Roach's previous books, and those folks are pretty brave, important, and exposed if you ask me.I thought the critique was especially weird because this book, of all of Roach's I read, finished on a very sweet, thoughtful note. Well, I thought the critique was weird until I remember it was a book critic, so the person probably didn't even read the damn thing.And you know what? If you don't see humor in the idea of stink bombs, this clearly isn't the book for you. Nor is this the Earth for you. Because there is A LOT of smelly shit hanging around here, and some of it's pretty comical. "
295,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6085797-elise,4,"In her typical hilarious style, in this book Mary Roach tackles the science of war. Not the science that will kill the most people on the opposing side, but the one that will keep the most people on this side alive. She participates in a training session for medics in the middle of a battlefield, visits a base in Africa and goes around the mess hall asking about diarrhea, visits a submarine carrying nuclear warheads... all with humour and the greatest respect for what she's describing. Always with the funny anecdotes that will make you literally laugh out loud while you're reading.As in the other two books I read by her, I loved the construction of this one, how each chapter neatly segued into the next one. And the conclusion was lovely, the last sentence was perfect."
296,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1205220-matt,3,"I'm the arrogant sort of person who when I rate a book think that there is some objective element to my rating, and that I'm not merely rating how much I personally enjoyed the book, but also on some level how worthy the book is of enjoyment and how much quality was exercised in the crafting of the book from the level of the individual sentence on up to its grand conceptions and story arc. You might say that in rating a book, my expectation is that everyone else will enjoy the book to within +/- a star of what I rated it, depending on how much the material personally appealed to you and how much - for whatever reasons - you were willing to overlook the books evident flaws. Otherwise, if I did not in fact believe this, whatever would be the reason for rating a book, for if my rating was wholly subjective it would do you no good whatsoever. Mary Roach's book ""Grunt: The Curious Science of Humans at War"" and similar books challenge those presumptions somewhat, in that I don't think a simple one dimensional rating system can in this case predict how much the book will be enjoyed. While for me the book was largely, ""Meh"" and parts of it were grating, that's because the book is pitched at a target audience that just falls outside of anything that would be a sweet spot for me.What's Roach is writing is essentially a primer on basic science and engineering, organized around one of the most interesting fields of basic research in the world today - America's high tech war machine. In an academic world too often focused more on publishing results than doing good work, much less doing anything hard and then managing to repeat it, the Defense Department could care less about how much you publish or where you publish, just so long as you give them tangible solutions. It's research wing DARPA is continually at the forefront of progress. Yet for all this, it's also not just interested in fighting the next war, but also the next and the next, and so very interested in the basic research that may lead to great advances way down the line.Roach approaches this material from a welcome angle, of looking at the less glamorous less macho programs that aim not to create better means of killing people, but rather solve other equally important basic problems of being human in a battlefield environment. For most of human history, man versus nature was still more lethal and more important on a battlefield than the other tribe with its weapons trying to kill you. Infection, disease, starvation, and exposure to the environment killed more men on most military campaigns than the battles did. Roach puts a lens on the modern Defense department's continuing research into keeping soldiers physically and mentally fit during the hardships and horrors of war, and she does so with a self-deprecating, rapier wit and an outsider's eye for the unusual, the bizarre, and details others might miss.It could be the making of a book I really enjoy, but the basic problem here is - I already know most of the stuff she covers. For me, the book would have been more interesting had it been taken in one of two directions. Either it would have been more enjoyable for me to focus less on the science, and more on the persons involved in the science and the interesting characters she discovers along the way and the anecdotes about them. This is information I don't have, and some of the biographies she uncovers are interesting in their own right - but she doesn't ever go into these people in any great depth, relying instead on deft caricature to set the stage like a comic book artist or a good Game Master. On the other hand, when she delves into the actual science and engineering, I occasionally discovered something I didn't know before, but then all too quickly she was plowing on to some other topic or providing some basic exposition of another fundamental aspect of the science or engineering problem being discussed. As a result, she never actually went into any one subject with the depth I would have liked.And all this time she's trying to be a comedian as well, with varying degree of success. Personally, as a near autistic, many of her wry asides just struck me as being mean spirited. She had enough empathy for her audience that I didn't feel like she was treating the reader to a tour through a carnival freak show - ""Come see the geeks"" - but at times I did feel like she felt her desired audience wouldn't understand her empathy, and she still needed to convince them that she wasn't one of the nerds and that she certainly didn't approve of this whole military thing so that she'll still get invited to parties with the right sort of people in SF. That is to say, some of the humor seemed a bit jarring and out of place, like she was two people - one admiring interviewer and the other hidden one that was laughing at who she was interviewing -and she was better when her asides and jokes were humble.In short, I'm convinced that for the right sort of person who has never even thought of these sort of things, and who enjoys science even if they don't practice it themselves, or has a narrow field of view and hasn't looked much at the big picture this is a five star book. Mrs. Roach has in effect here done admirable journalism and investigation, and turned obscure but important areas of endeavor into a readable funny work suitable for wide consumption. Despite the three stars, I strongly recommend this book to anyone who doesn't have any interest in the military, or whose interest in either science or the military has been at most casual."
297,0393354377,http://goodreads.com/user/show/136066-casey,4,"It's best to approach most Mary Roach books as collections of essays based on a common topic. This isn't my first rodeo with her (can you write about rodeos next, Mary? I won't take a fee for that suggestion), so I knew this would be all over the place. However, I didn't predict just how expansive a topic military science would be. While I anticipated chapters on topics like sleep deprivation, I can honestly say that I knew nothing of penile reconstruction before this. Now I (and whoever read over my shoulder on the subway) know a whole lot! Seriously fascinating stuff, as always."

If you would have asked me to read a book about the military and war, I probably would have said no thanks. However, Roach makes you want to read about the topic. She provides an angle not normally contemplated, but intriguing none the less. "
