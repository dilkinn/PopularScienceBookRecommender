""I just thought I should say hi since I see you're reading Talking to Strangers."" I too thought Malcolm Gladwell's new book was going to teach me how to literally talk with people I don't know, but as always he turns all my assumptions on their head with this book. If that's what the book was about, that stranger and I might be on a date by now. If I can convince you of one thing in this book, let it be this: Strangers are not easy... We think we can easily see into the hearts of others based on the flimsiest of clues.At the 2019 book conference BookExpo America, Malcolm pointed out that the problems exemplified by the death of Sandra Bland, a black woman arrested by a white policeman, are everywhere, not just in the darkest areas of America. It lies not only with these individuals but within each of us. In his book, he takes huge scandals (and who doesn't love to read about a scandal?), reaches deep inside like you would your skinniest jeans and then pulls them inside out. Except that when he does this, you suddenly realize your jeans had actually been inside out before. It is mind bending, which means that you have to follow along to at least page 54 before you start to understand where Malcolm is going. You will either find this too convoluted to keep going at some point or you will read it all in one sitting, as I did flying from NY to CA. My one frustration with this book is that at the very end Malcolm spends only 2 pages (2!) saying what we should do about all he just taught us. After speeding through the book, that feels like an abrupt stop. On the other hand, I can't stop thinking about what he reveals along the way. I can't unsee what he has shown me and now my framework of looking at the world is different. And isn't that the mission of any good book?SPOILER ALERT: For those of you who don't keep reading the book, here are my key insights. But to really understand what Malcolm argues happened in cases like Fidel Castro's fooling of the CIA, the deceptions of Bernie Madoff, the trial of Amanda Knox, the suicide of Sylvia Plath, the Jerry Sandusky pedophilia scandal, and the death of Sandra Bland you need to read the whole book. 1. THE DEFAULT TO TRUTH PROBLEM We do not behave, in other words, like sober-minded scientists, slowing gathering evidence of the truth or falsity of something before reaching a conclusion. We do the opposite. We start by believing. And we stop believing only when our doubts and misgivings rise to the point where we can no longer explain them away.For a very few, there is no high threshold before doubts turn into disbelief - dishonesty and stupidity is everywhere. In Russian folklore, this archetype is called yurodivy, the ""Holy Fool."" We should be strategically inserting these people where our society has a blind eye, to be whistle blowers, however we don't want these to blanket their judgement on everyone. While  we think we want our guardians to be alert to every suspicion, that is actually key to where the police officer so tragically failed Sandra Bland. It wasn't that he didn't do what he was trained to do, but that he did exactly what he was trained to do. He was taught to blanket perfectly innocent people with suspicion in case of the rare instance of a criminal. This kind of thinking leads to the distrust we see between police and the community today. To assume the best of another is the trait that has created modern society. Those occasions when our trusting nature is violated are tragic. But the alternative - to abandon trust as a defense against predation and deception - is worse.2. THE TRANSPARENCY PROBLEM  Transparency is a myth. How people are feeling inside often does NOT perfectly match how they appear on the outside, which means we are misjudging other's intentions. This doesn't matter as much with close friends where you understand what their idiosyncratic expressions mean (I had a friend who would often abruptly get up and leave. Other people would think she was very angry at something someone had said, but I saw nothing wrong because I could tell she wasn't angry at all.) When we are confronted with a stranger, we have to substitute an idea - a stereotype - for direct experience. And that stereotype is wrong all too often. However while this strategy for dealing with strangers is deeply flawed, it is also socially necessary. The requirement of humanity means that we have to tolerate an enormous amount of error. That is the paradox of talking to strangers. We need to talk to them. But we're terrible at it... we're not always honest with each other about just how terrible at it we are.""3. THE MISMATCH PROBLEM We are bad lie-detectors in those situations when the person we're judging is mismatched. A mismatch is where someone's level of truthfulness does NOT correspond with the way they look. I think someone is honest based on how they look and act but in actuality they are lying and I can't tell the difference. Malcolm dissects the case of Brock Turner, where because these two strangers were blind drunk, myopia removed the highest order constraint on their behavior. Myopia makes it hard to consider the long-term consequences, so a sexually aggressive teenager's impulses are no longer kept in check by an understanding of how inappropriate those behaviors are and the long term risks of those behaviors. Combine that with mismatching and transparency problems and it's a disaster. If you want people to be themselves in a social encounter with a stranger - to represent their own desires honestly and clearly - then they can't be blind drunk. 4. THE COUPLING PHENOMENON  The first set of mistakes we make with strangers... have to do with our inability to make sense of the stranger as an individual. But there's a second category of error that has to do with our inability to appreciate the context in which the stranger operates... Coupling is the idea that behaviors are linked to very specific circumstances and conditions.For instance, both crime and suicides are coupled - tied to very specific places and contexts. Outside of those places and contexts, the rate of both go down drastically. That means when you confront the stranger, you have to ask yourself where and when you're confronting the stranger - because those two things powerfully influence your interpretation of who the stranger is.SO WHAT SHOULD WE DO? We could start by no longer penalizing each other for defaulting to truth... We should also accept the limits of our ability to decipher strangers... But far more important than a little grace and humility over what we cannot do, we should be clear about what we can [do]... There are clues to making sense of the stranger. But attending to them requires humility and thoughtfulness and a willingness to look beyond the stranger, and take time and place and context into account. Malcolm Gladwell was motivated by a need to understand the truth of what happened with Sandra Bland and other recent scandals. His conclusion is that the ""truth"" ... is not some hard and shiny object that can be extracted if only we dig deep enough and look hard enough. The thing we want to learn about a stranger is fragile (just by stressing someone out you can affect their memory of what happened) ... We need to accept that the search to understand a stranger has real limits. We will never know the whole truth. We have to be satisfied with something short of that. The right way to talk to strangers is with caution and humility.Because we do not know how to talk to strangers, what do we do when things go awry with strangers? We blame the stranger.*My honest review was made possible by an Advanced Reader Copy from Book Expo America.*"
1,0316478520,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4622890-emily-may,4,"I was trying to work through my thoughts on this book when Goodreads did an interview with Malcolm Gladwell and this one thing he said just made everything clear for me:
“I've never been a writer who's looked to persuade his readers; I'm more interested in capturing their interest and curiosity.”
Because, truthfully, I don't know that Gladwell did fully convince me of his way of thinking with this book. I don't know that I actually agree that he can draw a link between the police officer “misunderstanding” Sandra Bland and Neville Chamberlain “misunderstanding” Hitler and make that work. And I don't know that I agree - actually, no, I'm pretty sure I don't - about the way he views the Stanford rape case as a ""misunderstanding"".*But, still, I couldn't look away from this book. It's the first book I've read by Gladwell and I can see now why he has become something of a pop-nonfiction writer because he definitely knows how to capture your attention. It's got some psychology, a bit of anthropology, a touch of politics, a dash of espionage... what's not to like?I found it absolutely fascinating and horrifying when he shows how a ""blind"" machine can more correctly judge the character and bail risk of criminals than human judges and trained law enforcement. I really enjoyed learning about the way we characterize and judge facial expressions and how this is both misleading AND differs across cultures, so not only do we often incorrectly judge those in our own society and culture, but we've got no chance when faced with someone from a different country. You ever been to a foreign country and thought people were looking at you weird? Turns out their face might just be in ""neutral"" or they're even being friendly!He backs things up with respectable studies and acknowledges limitations when appropriate, which I liked. I do think he umbrellas a lot of very different examples under the ""Talking to Strangers"" label, and not all of them seem realistically linked to me. But they are interesting, nevertheless.
We think we can easily see into the hearts of others based on the flimsiest of clues. We jump at the chance to judge strangers. We would never do that to ourselves, of course. We are nuanced and complex and enigmatic. But the stranger is easy.If I can convince you of one thing in this book, let it be this: Strangers are not easy.
In the end, though, he brings all this information, all these studies and examples together to leave us with an idea that is nothing new, but that I think we are all too quick to forget: people are more complex than they first appear. Don’t judge a book by its cover, if you will. Some people are assholes; others are just socially-challenged (me!). Some people are guilty; others just get that shifty look when walking through the metal detectors at the airport (also me!).I can't deny that I now want to read all his other books.*In Gladwell's defense, he spoke with a number of sensitivity readers for this chapter and he discusses it in far more depth than I've given the impression of. He goes out of his way to stress that he isn't making excuses for the culprit, but is mostly critical of blackout drinking culture and how this makes an understanding of consent impossible.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube"
2,0316478520,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6894205-allie,1,"TW: detailed descriptions of rape and pedophiliaIf it were possible to give a book negative stars, this would be a -10 for me.Malcolm Gladwell is incredibly influential. From books to podcasts to TED talks, he seems to be everywhere and his story-based approach reaches a large number of people who don't question his credentials as a journalist (with no scientific training) who writes about science. I enjoyed Blink and Outliers despite the often dodgy claims Gladwell makes based on studies that are small, poorly designed and/or not replicable. The man does know how to create an engaging narrative and create ‘aha’ moments that excite the reader. And, after all, he admits he isn't a scientist, but instead ""...a storyteller who uses research to augment the stories—who places the stories in the lead and the science in a supporting role, rather than the other way around.""Okay, I hear you shrugging. So what? Well, in Talking to Strangers, Gladwell brings his folksy approach and tendency to present his opinions as truth to a painful and horrifying subject: sexual abuse. The book explores our inability to tell when people are lying, especially when they are confident and lack obvious tells (e.g., shifty eyes, covered mouth). Gladwell suggests most people ""default to truth"" when interacting with strangers and that considerable evidence is needed before we believe someone is lying. Moreover, he feels this approach is vital to our social compact. By contrast, he believes approaching people with distrust as a default (such as police officers who see every person as a potential suspect) would make normal functioning impossible. In making his case, Gladwell describes two cases of serial pedophiles who operated for decades before being caught: Larry Nassar, the doctor who molested young female gymnasts in his care (often in the presence of their parents), and Jerry Sandusky, the coach who sodomized young boys in his sports programs and foster care. Reading these stories--which described how the young victims were raped and assaulted in page after page of excruciating detail--made me want to scrub my brain with bleach. And then we get to Gladwell's conclusion: that our inability to detect lies means that we should not be too harsh in judging the various adults who failed to protect children who were being sexually assaulted. Here's how he puts it: ""...those victimized by default to truth deserve our sympathy, not our censure.""To clarify, the ""victims"" in this sentence are not the children who were raped, but the adults (parents, teachers, employers of pedophiles) who ignored warning signs and suspicious behavior for years. People who buried evidence. People who dismissed the discomfort expressed by the children who lacked the vocabulary to explain the horror of being violated by an adult in a position of trust.Graham Spanier, the former Penn President, was told by one of his own employees that Sandusky was seen in the shower with a young boy, at night in deserted gym facilities, with his body right up against the child. He did not go to the police. He did not call Child Services. He accepted the suggestion from another staff member that Sandusky was just ""horsing around"" and let the matter drop. Gladwell has a lot of sympathy for Spanier, stating: ""...people liked Grahman Spanier. It's why he had such a brilliant career. It's why you and I would want to work for him. We want Graham Spanier as our President. We think we want our guardians to be alert to every suspicion. We blame them when they default to truth...without stopping to consider the consequences of those actions."" Actually, no. I don't want Spanier as my university President. Or anywhere except in a prison cell. Nor do I think any consequences could be worse than a society that allows children to be abused. A little distrust (or a trust but verify approach) is a good thing when the vulnerable are involved.Gladwell also spends quite a bit of time throwing doubt on the stories of the boys victimized by Sandusky, noting contradictions and inconsistencies. Gladwell is not a trained psychologist, psychiatrist or a trauma abuse counselor. He has zero experience in dealing with the victims of sexual abuse. Contradictory stories are common in cases of child molestation, as the victims often try to repress or justify their abuse. Gladwell did not personally know any of the children involved. It's unclear if he knows anyone who has suffered from sexual abuse. Yet he feels it is appropriate to suggest that the victims were lying (or wrong) and that Spanier was mistreated for being too trusting. Later in the book, he defends rapists, including Brock Turner. (In case the name rings a bell, that was the frat guy who undressed, fingered, and tried to rape an unconscious woman behind a dumpster, only to be scared off by two other students.) Gladwell feels that alcohol and mixed signals are mainly responsible for rape. Brock's victim calls for sensitively training on college campuses to help men learn to respect women and says that while heavy drinking was a factor in what happened, it was not the reason for her rape. Her powerful open letter to the court made me cry. Yet Gladwell disagrees with her assessment of why the rape happened, stating:""Brock Turner was asked to do something of crucial importance that night-to make sense of a stranger's desires and motivations. That is a hard task for all of us under the best circumstances. Asking a drunk and immature nineteen-year-old to do that in the hyper-sexualized chaos of a frat party, is an invitation to disaster.""Not raping someone is a hard task? Gladwell acknowledges harm was done, but he also asks whether the victim flirted with Brock, whether she struggled, or whether she stumbled outside willingly! I agree alcohol clouds judgement and have no problem limiting it as part of a strategy to address assault on campus. But a good man doesn't rape a women, regardless of how much he has been drinking. At best, limiting alcohol might deter monsters like Brock by getting them to think about the possible consequences of their actions (e.g., jail).Reading this book was like wading through a sewer. The fact that someone with Gladwell’s influence is using his platform to excuse people complicit in sexual assault is disgusting. I will certainly never read anything by Gladwell again.For more on Gladwell's misrepresentation of science: https://slate.com/technology/2013/10/...https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/arc...For more on him as an apologist for abusers: https://www.theguardian.com/books/201..."
3,0316478520,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17744555-blackoxford,2,"Never Trust a Blood RelativeTalking to Strangers is an elaboration of a simple (trivial?) idea: It’s very difficult to tell when people are lying. According to Timothy Levine, the academic psychologist on whom Gladwell relies for his basic argument, the presumption that people tell the truth is almost universal, a few Holy Fools (and, I suppose, Judge Judy) excepted. Levine calls this his Truth Default Theory. Gladwell applies it entertainingly, if rather repetitively, to cases of duplicity ranging from double agents in government agencies to international financial fraud.The interesting part of Gladwell’s thesis is that we can’t be trained out of our predisposition to believe what ‘credible’ people, that is, folk who exhibit facial traits and body language which conform to cultural conventions, have to say. Police, judges, regulatory officials, even counter-espionage experts have equally poor records for detecting falsehood compared to the rest of us (it also works the other way round: truth-telling appears as lying if accompanied by ‘mis-matched’ behavioural signals). We are genetically programmed to be dupes (I suspect sex as the evolutionary motive!). And there is no reliable technology that does any better. The implication for me is that the more anyone is familiar with expected conventional behavioural responses, and can perform these as needed, the more credible they will be. Not a terribly innovative conclusion admittedly, but it does suggest that Gladwell has the wrong end of the authenticity-stick. We may have to worry about strangers being honest; but the real danger is the mendacity of those closest to us, those who know what we find credible, namely intimate family members, not strangers.There’s another issue as well. It’s clear that most 0f us lie to ourselves from time to time, that is, we conveniently and selectively recall events which confirm our self-rationalising narratives. We cannot observe our own physical behaviour to determine the extent of mismatch. Nor would it make any difference if we could since we may actually believe our own press, as it were. I know academics and business people who act this way as a matter of routine. It’s part of their strategy for success. They speak and write with total conviction about things they really know nothing about. One of these may be the president of the United States. Who knows, perhaps even Gladwell is amongst these experts at self-delusion and is simply scamming the rest of us with complete sincerity.Or am I merely projecting a sort of cynicism about Gladwell’s slick rapportage? Possibly. But he does seem to have a somewhat murky past as a defender of several dodgy industries like tobacco and pharmaceuticals (See: https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1...). Presumably he was quite handy at spinning credible publicity out of otherwise damaging facts. “Transparency,” Gladwell says, “is a myth—an idea we’ve picked up from watching too much television and reading too many novels.” One wonders to what degree his book might be an instance of the phenomenon he is describing.Oh, and as an aside, the attribution of the death of a black student in the custody of a Texas jail to an ‘escalating miscommunication between strangers’ verges on the obscene. His use of this example to book-end his narrative and his references to it as a recurring theme suggest some serious judgmental deficiencies. I don’t feel myself defaulting to truth, or Gladwell’s purported truth, in the least.Postscript 18Sept19: it appears that Gladwell’s bubble is bursting: https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/arc..."
4,0316478520,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4859447-megan,1,"UPDATE 9/23/19I have now changed this to one star. The more I read about this and other pseudo psych crap he pushes...no no no. The enjoyment of some parts of the book does not outweigh the total garbage of parts of it. Two examples are linked below, with a particularly shocking tidbit from one:https://deadspin.com/malcolm-gladwell...https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/arc...The most important part of the first link:Gladwell: You know I have that chapter on Jerry Sandusky in my book, and it’s all about how I feel the leadership of Penn State was totally, outrageously attacked over this. I think they’re blameless.Simmons: Yeah.Gladwell: But with Joe Paterno... Joe Paterno essentially did nothing wrong. He hears the allegation and immediately tells his superiors, and the critique of Joe Paterno was essentially, “Why was a 75-year-old football coach not behaving towards a suspected pedophile with the savvy and insight of a psychiatrist?”Simmons: Right.Gladwell: He’s a football coach! He doesn’t even know what the word—there was this hilarious—[regretful sigh] hilarious—there was this moment in, I think one of the trial transcripts, where someone was asked, “Did you use, when you went to”—the quarterback who goes to Paterno, McQueary, the former quarterback, goes to Paterno to tell him this allegation—“Did you use the word sodomy?” And he’s like, “No I didn’t use the word sodomy.” And then there’s this sort of thing, I think, where they’re wondering whether Paterno actually knew what the word sodomy was [laughing].Simmons: Right.Gladwell: He doesn’t! He’s been thinking football 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, for 60 years. He is not going to be alert to the darkness inside the heart of one of his former coaches. You can’t ask him to do that. That’s why you have mental health professionals or fit, trained psychologists in the world to handle those kind of problems. We do this thing sometimes when a crisis happens, when we suddenly expect our leaders to be skilled at absolutely every job under the sun. They’re not. NO, I JUST EXPECT LEADERS TO HAVE A FEW BRAIN CELLS THEY CAN POOL TOGETHER TO UNDERSTAND APPROPRIATE RELATIONSHIPS!! WWWWTTTF! Also as a teacher (and there are many other professions that wear many hats--doctors, nurses, social workers, business owners, entrepreneurs, literally almost any job) I am ABSOLUTELY expected to perform more than one specific role. I manage data, help with emotions, involve the community, report suspected abuse and so on. As do many other underpaid and undervalued professions. So it's DISGUSTING and insulting to literally everyone to imply we can allow and expect rich football coaches to be all, ""aw shucks, I was only thinking about my next game.""------------------------------------------------------------------------------Ugh. The positive is, Gladwell always keeps me interested. He somehow finds the most interesting anecdotes and stories. Even the ones you have heard before---he has a way of making them seem like there is always more than meets the eye and that they are more interesting. I was never bored listening to this because even if you don't like one section, he's almost on to something else.But then..His thing is to take stories that on the surface are completely unrelated and tries to jam them together to fit his central thesis. In this book, the main thesis is the idea that we can't appropriately understand/analyze strangers because we try to get them to fit in a box. That doesn't work because we don't understand everything about that person and their context/background. For example, If a person is mean, he acts like __________. If a person is a crook, he will act__________. Them acting opposite of what we assume they should act like causes us to misjudge them and get the wrong idea. Well, surely this is not a new idea...? To me, many of the examples he use either don't fit this, have many other factors involved, or at times he even contradicts his own theories.Let's start with Sandra Bland. His favored incident in the book. His argument here is that she didn't fit the idea of ""law abiding citizen"" the cop had in his head when he pulled her over and it caused him to be afraid and assume she was a criminal. She was ""shifty"", ""irritable,"" and generally not happy to be pulled over. Well, who is? I've had some tickets in my day and I have only once been what would be called a bit snappy to a cop, but even when polite, I generally always feel on edge. I've even cried before when I was struggling with money and afraid of getting a ticket. I don't want a ticket, and if I'm getting one, I want the situation to be over ASAP. Don't we all? So compare me to Sandra, who as a black woman has a whole extra level of fear of the situation, as well as the fact that she has had many more traffic stops than I over generally minor stuff. These cost her a lot of money and are very stressful. Even if the officer didn't know she got stopped often in the past, anyone who has been watching the news LIKE EVER knows African-Americans may at times act more nervous or aggregated than white drivers because of cases like Freddie Gray, Michael Brown, etc etc. And if ANYONE knows this, it damn well would and should be a cop! How are we to believe he had no clue about the racial subtext of pulling over African-American drivers? Beyond the facts of race, cops should know about de-escalation which if you hear the tape, he did not do this at all. He didn't even attempt it. Let's recall she is pulled over for not signaling which Gladwell fully admits the cop caused by tailing her. Which adds to her irritation. He gets petty with her over lighting a cigarette and screams at her to step out of the car over it. So this pseudo-psych theory that ""she isn't acting as he would expect and it made him 'terrified' of her,"" is just.....BS. I don't discount cops have a hard job and it's harder than we can ever know to stay calm and read strangers. But....but....this was literally all on the cop. If me, being an average citizen knows about deescalation and how race plays a role in traffic stops, no way he did not. Was she a little rude? Maybe, but public service employees (cops, teachers, nurses, etc) have to be able to deal with people who are a little rude. You don't scream at them to get out of the car or say you are going to light them up or say 'good' when they tell you they have epilepsy and they are worried for their health now. I also don't think he was terrified of her and if he was and that's all it took, he's either racist, has power issues, or just an awful cop. Or all of the above? No psych about it. She should never have walked away with felony charges.To be fair, he is not at happy with how the cop acted that day, but I am more bothered by his over-analysis of the cop. Like this psychology explains his bad behavior. Then comes Jerry Sandusky. REALLY?? Is this the hill you wanna die on, Malcolm? That Sandusky was ""unfairly treated?"" Is it possible he is innocent? I guess. Save video tape of someone committing a crime and dozens of witnesses, it's possible ANY convicted criminal could be innocent. I tried really hard to keep an open mind but it's never even clear WHY he believes this so strongly. He says ""it's nothing like the Larry Nassar case,"" which it is often compared to. Why does a crime have to be very similar to another crime of it's type to be true? He says they had more victims. Those victims also never waver in their stories and told many people over the years. First of all, those were girls and these are all boys. One would imagine they may behave differently in the situation. Second of all, and hear me out---is it possible these victims of assault didn't act the way Gladwell felt victims of assault ""should act?"" Which is his whole theory (we have set ideas of how people should act in certain situations) and yet he comes out on the other side implying Sandusky may be innocent?! Then also, what exactly is the naked showering with slapping sounds if not sex? Just horseplay?? More BS, and if it was .... what adult man would not know horseplay of that manner with a child is destined to be construed as something else?? He never even comes down or attempts to explain why a grown man would engage in naked horseplay with a child. Then of course, Brock Turner. Yes, college kids should probably drink less alcohol. Wow. Revolutionary. The fact he has to say outright it's not victim blaming reveals he knows what shaky ground he is on.Just, ugh. He tries sooooo hard and has so many holes and flaws in his arguments. I wish he would just tell the stories and stop trying to be intellectual about it."
5,0316478520,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38610813-paromjit,2,"Malcolm Gladwell is viewed as a hugely influential writer and I was eagerly anticipating reading this, my first taste of his work, a body of his thinking on how we, the people, are extraordinarily gullible when it comes to strangers, all too easily taken in by them in our general eagerness to trust rather than be more cautious. He gives a raft of well known examples from history, such as Neville Chamberlain being all to willing to take Hitler at face value, and more recent contemporary examples, such as the runaway success of Bernie Madoff's fraudulent ponzi scheme until it all fell apart, interspersed with interviews with prominent personalities. It turns out that overall, I was doomed to be disappointed with this book.For me he makes far too many generalisations, often jumping to ill thought out judgements and conclusions whilst omitting key variables, and all too keen to let off those with responsibilities to prevent abuse. The problem is that he sounds frighteningly plausible and genial in the manner in which he lays out his often controversial, poorly researched thinking, so disarmingly seductive, and there are occasions that I cannot deny he is certainly interesting and thought provoking. The latter is insufficient for me to recommend this tome to other readers, I would prefer to direct readers to the many far more expert and well thought out other psychological studies on the complexities of human communication, which in my view will turn out to be a more helpful and productive experience, and additionally are more academically rigorous. Many thanks to Penguin UK for an ARC."
6,0316478520,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8637462-betsy,2,"9/2/2019--I'm knocking this down to two stars. Gladwell's really bad takes on things like race and sexual assault just don't deserve an okay rating.Wow, does this book ever suffer from a severe case of foot-in-mouth disease! I almost didn’t make it past the introduction. In my pre-publication copy, Gladwell writes, “The Sandra Bland case came in the middle of a strange interlude in American public life” and then goes on to discuss a series of cases of police violence against black people that happened around 2014. “Strange interlude.” Really?That phrasing suggests that this treatment was some sort of aberration in American history and that the violence only happened during the few years he references. Did Gladwell really mean to ignore America’s long history of this problem? I don’t think so? I think he may have meant that the attention paid to police violence was unusual, but dude, choose your words much more carefully.Later on, there are some good points made about how and why we tend to misunderstand each other. But, again, I almost put the book down, this time while reading the chapter on the Brock Turner sexual assault case. Without going into detail, that chapter could only have been written by someone who's buried his head in the sand over the past five years or so.It’s tough to ignore the problematic elements of Talking to Strangers. I could absolutely see the discussion of the causes of sexual assault offending some readers to the point that they abandon the book altogether. I’ve definitely enjoyed other books by the author a lot more than this one. Three stars, but that’s being generous.Thanks to NetGalley and Little, Brown and Company for giving me a DRC of this book, which will be available for purchase on September 10th."
7,0316478520,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33082780-jennifer,1,"I DNF'd this book after reading too many cringey statements from Gladwell. He wants to categorize a whole range of evils -- from the victimization of unarmed black people (Sandra Bland) to women being raped at colleges parties (Brock Turner) -- as mere ""communication"" issues between people. Sure, there might be some element of miscommunication, but it completely misses the point that there are much larger problems and bigger things going on beyond that. I get that he's trying to cram these situations into his premise in order to write this book, but the result is completely tone-deaf and helps to justify crimes and ignorance. Instead of encouraging people to be educated on things the don't understand like consent or why prejudice against black people can lead to excessive force against them, Gladwell chalks it up to ""communication"" barriers.To be clear, Gladwell doesn't try to say that Bland was at fault for her death, but rather that the officer didn't properly de-escalate. However, he also takes time to explain why race had nothing to do with the situation. For example, he ignores the mountain of evidence that shows that black people are routinely pulled over more frequently. Instead, Gladwell explicitly states that the officer's decision was not race-motivated. However, he reaches this conclusion based on nothing. His sole support for that statement is the statistic that shows this officer often wrote tickets -- to the tune of 1,557 just that year -- but it's a meaningless number that doesn't prove anything if we don't know if those tickets were evenly or fairly distributed. There's also the question of whether this book states anything new. The idea that black people are treated exactly the same as everyone else and racism is a myth or that women who drink are partially to blame for being raped are two extremely old arguments. There's nothing new or interesting about it. It's old, tired and not worth anyone's time. There's also questionable logical leaps that Gladwell makes to put forth his antiquated arguments. Mystifyingly, a survey showing that people have different ideas on what constitutes ""consent"" leads him to the conclusion that there ""are no rules"" when it comes to consent. Umm what? So if I took a survey that showed that most people don't know where the Ukraine is located, does that mean the Ukraine has no location or does it mean that people are ignorant? Gladwell's tortured logic for the sake of justifying rape is mind-boggling. Skip this awful, intellectually vapid book."
8,0316478520,http://goodreads.com/user/show/352711-leftbanker,1,"If this had just been stories about spies and the meeting between Hernán Cortés and Montezuma or whatever, I would have rated it five stars. There’s no question that Malcolm Gladwell is a good storyteller, I just wish that he would leave it at that and stop trying to shoe-horn a bunch of tall tales into some sort of coherent statement about the state of the world. I’m not a scientist, but I think that I know science when I see it. I ain’t seeing it here.“The death of Sandra Bland is what happens when a society does not know how to talk to strangers.”This is the stupidest thing I’ve heard concerning this tragedy. This was also the whole point of this book and Galdwell’s facile explanation is completely without merit.The cop was, quite simply, a ginormous fucking asshole. We have it all on film, for Christ’s sake. He just couldn’t let it go that this black woman wasn’t bowing down to him and had the temerity to light up a cigarette in his majestic presence. He pulled her over (as he states) for failing to signal a lane change when he pulled behind her. Are you kidding me? What kind of cop does that?Brian Encinia: OK, ma’am. [Pause.] You OK?Bland: I’m waiting on you. This is your job. I’m waiting on you. When’re you going to let me go? Encinia: I don’t know, you seem very, really irritated.Bland: I am. I really am. I feel like it’s crap what I’m getting a ticket for. I was getting out of your way. You were speeding up, tailing me…so yeah, I’m a little irritated.Brian Encinia: Are you done?“Are you done?” What a total asshole! There is absolutely no question that his tone was completely nasty, just listen to the video. He asked her if she was OK. What does he expect her to say? “Thank you for pulling me over and fucking with me for no reason whatsoever.” This was that point when it went from a bullshit traffic stop to something sinister on his part where he had something to prove to himself. Unfortunately, it came at the expense of another human being who was simply trying to make it through the day.I wish that Sandra Bland had asked him, “Is this why you became a cop? To hassle people for no good reason?”She was so incredibly reasonable, and the cop was just a huge asshole. End of story. There are no two sides to this. He is unfit for the job. He either hates black people, or he just hates people. Either way, he doesn’t deserve the public trust that is necessary to be a policeman.This brings up the entire nature of police work. Like most other American kids, I grew up on a steady diet of TV and movies in which the heroes were cops, yet I never consider being a policeman for even a split second. Why? Probably because I just never felt the need to have power over anyone else, I never felt that I had something to prove. We need to test police recruits for this tendency and weed them out if they have a chip on their shoulder, like Brian Encinia. He should definitely not be a policeman. He is a terrible human being, especially after the fact when he testified that he felt his life was in danger.Human beings are sometimes—or oftentimes—fooled by a load of shit some stranger passes off on them. Gladwell is now infamous for cherry-picking examples that prove his point while ignoring volumes that tell of a different outcome. People are often wrong about the intentions of strangers they talk to…except when they are right.In all of his ramblings about the CIA, the only conclusion we should come to is that the U.S. should just stop spying and try being straightforward and open as a nation, just to see where that gets us. Spying has produced so little benefit, especially when you consider how much money we’ve poured into that black hole. OK, we got Bin Laden, but how much did it cost us to hunt down and assassinate one hairy, old religious fanatic? Imagine instead if we had used all of that money to build schools and hospitals around the world thus building goodwill. I think goodwill trumps some dead fanatic.“The issue with spies is not that there is something brilliant about them. It is that there is something wrong with us.”I couldn’t disagree with this more. I would turn this thought on its head: The issue with spies is not that there is something brilliant about them. It is that there is something wrong with them. Of course, the Soviets, East Germans, and Cubans beat the U.S. in spy-craft over the course of decades, because they are a people hatched in duplicitous dictatorships where obfuscation and deceit are required for survival. This is precisely why we should have never tried to battle them in this realm. We should have gone the route of honesty and full disclosure.As a nation, would we rather excel at deception or honesty?“Why are we so bad at detecting lies?”This is a stupid, meaningless question that makes about as much sense as asking why we are so bad at predicting the outcome of a sporting event. You win some, you lose some.With that said, if your job is to ferret out double agents in an intelligence organization and you interview someone you suspect, and then let them off the hook, you suck, to put it mildly.Gladwell extrapolates some incredibly outrageous outcomes from his little modern fairy tales.I had to skip over almost the entire section on the Penn State pedophile story. So, you are a grown man in a locker room. You see another man having sex with a child in plain sight, and you run away without doing anything? What a bunch of cowards we are! The McQueary guy “ran upstairs to call his parents.” What I would have done, had I been in that same situation, before running upstairs to call my parents, would have been to beat that pedo half-to-death. That would have been a better story to tell mom and dad than to say that I had witnessed a child rape and did fuck all about it. I couldn’t live with that level of cowardice.I had to skip over Chapter Six because it deals with the TV show Friends which makes me physically ill.Too Good Just for the CommentsGoodreads User James (https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4...) wrote:“Malcolm Gladwell: professional ultracrepidarian”I thought this was brilliant, at least I did after I looked up the word. As somewhat of a professional linguist, I sought out the roots of the word and found probably the most fascinating origin story of any word I’ve ever looked up.Ultracrepidarian:1) one who is presumptuous and offers advice or opinions beyond one’s sphere of knowledge.2) an insufferable gas bag (at least in Gladwell’s case)ETYMOLOGY:From Latin ultra (beyond) + crepidarius (shoemaker), from crepida (sandal). Earliest documented use: 1819.NOTES:The story goes that in ancient Greece there was a renowned painter named Apelles who used to display his paintings and hide behind them to listen to the comments. Once a cobbler pointed out that the sole of the shoe was not painted correctly. Apelles fixed it and encouraged by this the cobbler began offering comments about other parts of the painting. At this point the painter cut him off with “Ne sutor ultra crepidam” meaning “Shoemaker, not above the sandal” or one should stick to one’s area of expertise.Addition: The story was told by the Roman writer Pliny the Elder, hence Latin."

There is so much I don’t know - it’s pathetic & embarrassing. Also reading this ( listening) during the last few days of the year was challenging my lazy brain.

12,0316478520,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3614449-stephie,1,"Well. I think I’ve gotta jump off the Malcolm Gladwell bandwagon. This book really irritated me. First of all, with his previous books, the main argument has been very clear. But ‘Talking with Strangers’ is directionless and, at times, confusing. I didn’t even know what he meant by “strangers” as his definition seemed to keep changing. And I found myself wondering what his point was on more than one occasion. Furthermore, Gladwell has an annoying habit of presenting his opinions or his “research” (it’s debatable how much of it is actually *his* research) as facts. He is very good at picking and choosing data and statistics and framing them to make whatever point he wants, while ignoring all the other evidence that might disprove his statements. Makes for a good bestseller, I guess. But funny for a book that talks largely about truth and the ‘default-to-truth’ theory. I guess we should just assume that he’s telling us the truth? Maybe the book is a psychological experiment in itself to see how many people buy this bullshit? He makes some bizarre arguments. He excuses the defenders of paedophiles because of this ‘default-to-truth’ ethos. He seemingly empathises with them, because despite all evidence to the contrary it’s still (according to him) perfectly understandable that we would ignore said evidence because we like to assume that people are telling the truth.According to Gladwell’s claim in the Brock Turner chapter, that rape was a case of “miscommunication” compounded by alcohol consumption. It verges on victim blaming. Hmmm. And for the icing on the cake, he attributes the death of Sandra Bland, a young black American woman, again to a “miscommunication between strangers” instead of acknowledging the rather obvious systemic racism that lead to her death.It just doesn’t sit right with me. I feel that placing the blame on “miscommunication” ignores other very important factors like racism, sexism, corruption and so on. It’s an oversimplification, in my opinion. Also, I listened to this on Audible, and Gladwell says “Artic” instead of “Arctic”. Wtf. "
13,0316478520,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1849990-carole,5,"Talking to Strangers by Malcolm Gladwell appears to be a contentious book: the readers and reviewers have either hated it or loved it, nothing in between. I selected the audiobook version because the author usually reads his books, as he did in this one. The audiobook had an added bonus of providing the reader with actual or reproduced interviews and transcripts of the cases he used as examples. Gladwell extensively used well-known cases that show that, when dealing with people we do not know, we are not always the best judges of their character. Examples of this vary from Hitler to the Amanda Knox case in Italy and many others. Subjects dealt with include spying, child sexual abuse, bigotry, prejudice, financial dishonesty, etc. This book proves again that Malcolm Gladwell is an astute observer of the society we live in. I thought the subject matter was interesting and the research well-done. Highly recommended if you enjoy studying human nature. "
14,0316478520,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2199404-andy,2,"Gladwell is an excellent storyteller, but I think that sometimes he's dangerously wrong. When the president of Penn State hears about a former employee coming back to the college at night to ""horse around"" with a naked 11-year-old boy, well the most likely explanation is not benign. Gladwell keeps saying people default to the ""truth"" and to the ""most likely"" explanation. But in examples like this people are defaulting to denial. And that's not okay for those whose job is to be suspicious and responsible. Gladwell seems surprised that people are gullible and that social trust is important for social animals to thrive. He talks about the Milgram experiments, and gets lost in the weeds about how they were bad theater, underemphasizing the main point, i.e. that 65% of people were sheep who obeyed authority figures telling them to do insane evil things. The implication for what he's talking about is that decisions are made by a few people who create the conditions that then affect everyone else. And so what really matters is what the shepherds and sheepdogs are doing to protect the sheep from the wolves and other perils. Those protectors are supposed to sniff out wolves in sheep's clothing--that's their job. So yeah, it's literally ancient wisdom that we can't have everybody crying wolf all the time, but we do need someone to look out for wolves. I don't get journalists who don't get that some people have the role in society of being skeptical. If Gladwell's facts are correct about the Sandra Bland case, then the big issue there is the corruption of the scientific evidence on effective policing (basically the 80/20 rule: concentrate police scrutiny where the crimes are). Doing traffic stops everywhere all the time is just BS, regardless of racism issues. Wouldn't it be nice if someone had the job of calling BS on bad public policy? Michael Lewis's podcast series ""Against the Rules"" is so far all about the decline of the ""referee"" in America, and I think his insights are more apposite for this discussion about trust and social cohesion than Gladwell's. You can't play a game without referees. Referees can't just defer to the players/cheaters on whether or not they've broken the rules. The undermining of arbiters is what destroys societies."
15,0316478520,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2095173-traci-at-the-stacks,2,This book has some MAJOR issues and was pretty enraging and frustrating. The biggest technical issue is that there is no definition of “stranger” which allows Gladwell to mold his thin arguments to any hot button topic he chooses. It feels like a publicity stunt to cram as many controversial people/events into the book for maximum shock value. The other huge issue is about how he discusses rape/racism/abuse without talking about race/power/toxic masculinity etc. it’s negligent and dangerous. Gladwell is fantastic at crafting arguments which is what holds this book together but the content is flimsy and offensive. 
16,0316478520,http://goodreads.com/user/show/732347-kelly,0,"What I love about Gladwell's books is the thing that I think many people find frustrating: I don't agree with everything he says. But what brings me back is that he finds interesting threads and premises and manages to weave them together in such a way that it makes me think about my own beliefs a little different. This book begins with the Sandra Bland case. Why did she die? Why did this situation even occur? It then goes into looking at a series of incidents of the CIA overlooking spies from Cuba who embedded themselves in US operations and how because, as humans, we default to truth, we are really bad at sniffing out those who are deceiving us. This is the case even for the most highly trained. A few people, however, don't default this way. And this is precisely why Bernie Madoff played such a ponzi scheme -- one person who spoke up and out because things didn't feel right was made to feel as though he was overreacting. That no way could someone like Madoff, who looked too good to be involved in something like that, be a master criminal. Gladwell then takes us to the Amanda Knox case and explores why it is she was believed to be a key suspect in the death of her roommate. The answer is that Knox's behavior doesn't align with how people think it ought to be in the midst of a crisis and grief. She's goofy by nature, and her actions after such a crime didn't fit with the model people have of how she should act. So, they read her behaviors as signs of guilt, rather than considering that, perhaps, she acted the way she always did. The Brock Turner rape case is explored, too, and it's looked at not from the perspective of rape culture and toxic masculinity -- the narrative we all know and agree with because those aren't incorrect -- but rather, it's looked at from the point of alcohol and how it inhibits cognitive function. This was the case both for the victim and for Turner, making it impossible for a truthful account of what happened that night. There's no rape apologizing here; instead, it's a look at the context of the case that makes piecing it together challenging. This is coupling: alcohol was linked here. So what of the Bland case then? Gladwell talks about research done in academia about crime and how context matters there. ""Dangerous"" places often aren't. The problem is almost always isolated to a tiny portion of a place, like a few blocks in a city. This understanding led to Kansas City trying out a new method of policing, being highly concentrated in the worst areas in order to decrease crime. It worked.Why? People were willing to give up some of their privacy for the safe of their safety. They live in an area with high crime and significant drug use and gun violence, a visit from the police didn't bother them knowing that it had a direct effect on their environment. The problem was when that tactic was used outside the context. This was what Gladwell links together for the Sandra Bland story. A police officer, trained in the Kansas City method, removed the context from the situation. He also leaned heavily into not defaulting to truth. Bland? Her behavior didn't conform to the ideas of how someone ""should"" behave in the situation. The same pieces of the puzzle -- the coupling, the lack of context -- allows the Kansas City policing method to default to fault, as opposed to truth, too easily. See what happens in Ferguson (and not just the Michael Brown case, but in additional cases of unnecessary policing of a community). It's a really interesting premise and one that makes a good bit of sense. What Gladwell doesn't do, though, is address sexism here. He does touch on race -- especially about how black communities are already over policed -- but gender doesn't come into it quite enough. I wish we'd seen that layer here, especially as it tied into the Knox case AND how to relates back to the Bland case. Overall, it's one that will make me think a lot more about interactions with strangers, both those I have and those I don't. It's fascinating to think about how this might, too, connect with social media and how we do/don't connect with other people who are strangers to us. Rather than default to truth, it seems that in places like Twitter, we've come too quick to ignore the context, ignore the coupling effect, and we quickly default to anywhere but the truth. Something to really chew on, and surprisingly connected to the powerful first essay about Twitter in Trick Mirror: Reflections on Self-Delusion."
17,0316478520,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1045774-mehrsa,4,"What to say about Gladwell? I read everything he writes and I listen to his podcasts. Even as I cringe when he oversells his simplistic theories and misinterprets academic data to fit into cute stories. There are a lot of great stories in this book and some new takes on old ones, but at the end of the day the lens through which he demands we see these stories (i.e. our ""default to truth"" in talking to strangers) doesn't work. Sandra Bland's exchange with the officer did not result in her death because we aren't good at talking to strangers. Neither did Brock Turner's raping the Stanford woman nor Sandusky, etc. I get that these stories are all complicated. I think everyone gets that it's complicated and that there are two sides to these stories, but I don't think this telling is all that helpful in understanding these intricacies. In fact, it seems to trivialize them. Still, I don't think the book is bad. He's an excellent writer and storyteller and there are two few good writers these days so I will read all of them if I can--even without buying what they're selling."
18,0316478520,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7272234-celeste,1,"This is certainly a provocative book, enough so that despite my anger and frustration I finished reading it in the hope it would conclude with a complex and thoughtful analysis of why our differences and history result in so much misunderstanding when strangers interact with each other. Sadly my expectations were not realized. The real life examples that he used were not truly examined in depth and the lack of complexity often left me frustrated. I may just be unable to feel any sympathy for a convicted sex offender like Brock Turner, even if he drank too much, I just don't see that as an excuse for his behavior. But that was the basis I got from that example, they were both drunk and so there was misunderstanding, when I was waiting for rape culture to be brought up and added into the mix. Maybe the author doesn't see rape culture as a problem or a factor in this case.I am sure there are people that will benefit from reading this book, it certainly isn't bad. But I do not think I was the audience the author was writing for."
19,0316478520,http://goodreads.com/user/show/175635-trevor,4,"I haven’t been all that impressed by the last few books Gladwell has written and wasn’t even going to read this one at all – but then a friend at work said it related to some of the things I’ve been working on at the moment, and so I got hold of it – and I’m glad I did. In some ways this book could be summed up by saying that we are programmed to trust and believe people and that rather than needing to suspend disbelief, people often have to work very hard to lose our trust. For instance, American spies seem to have a remarkable soft-spot for Cuban spies – with US spies seemingly incapable of ever detecting Cuban ones. I never know what to make of the CIA (and all the other various three-letter-agencies). I’ve read The Legacy of Ashes and the Blowback series, and I didn’t particularly come away from reading those with a particularly high estimations of the abilities of US spies. That said, perhaps they are in fact infinitely more clever than they seem – well, they would have to be, wouldn’t they? And so these books saying they are all gormless is part of some elaborate double blind exercise to put us off our guard. Part of this details the torture techniques so gleefully adopted by the US in its war on terror, and so I had flashbacks to reading The Shock Doctrine. I find the whole idea of torture unspeakable. The US has much to answer for, but since it is the sole superpower, I guess we can’t expect it to answer for any of its crimes against humanity any time soon. Once again it was pretty clear that none of the information obtained under torture was in the least bit reliable – and not just because you might lie to get the torture to end, but also because memory is fragile and after torture the victim might even believe (really believe) they were George Washington if you electrocuted them enough.Part of the problem I had with this book is that ‘strangers’ isn’t ever quite defined – and so the strangers often ended up being people quite like you and me. Although it discusses some of the black lives matter incidents, that is, where strangers were decidedly not treated with an excess of trust, what is somewhat ignored is the problem of the strangers who are like the children in Yemen – think back to the last time you read about that war for a moment. Hard to remember, isn’t it? Yet, it has been on the brink of one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises for the last couple of years – and western governments are not only aiding the atrocities being carried out there, but also supplying arms and advice that is making matters a million times worse. Here are the real strangers. Like the strangers we send drones to blow to pieces. It all becomes like a hyper-real video game, the death of these strangers barely rates a shrug from us. There is, of course, money to be made in killing these desperately poor people, and this in a world where you could probably buy three or four dozen of them as effective slaves for less than the price of the drone we use to killed two or three of them. But strangers at a distance are not the concern of this book. The strangers considered here are also not quite the strangers Simmel talks of – those who do not quite belong amongst us, but who arrive, and have not yet left. This would have made an interesting book too – particularly given the ‘Build The Wall’ hysteria in the US that elected a madman to its highest office and the ‘Stop the Boats’ chants in Australia that has won a couple of elections, or the ‘Turks are coming’ that decided Brexit. These strangers, the kind that might end up separated from their children in cages at the border, or who commit suicide on an island north of Australian somewhere (at least they didn’t drown) are also mostly left faceless and are certainly not people we treat with an excess of trust.All the same, this book is interesting and it is worth knowing how we behave with strangers who are more like us. The best bits of this book were the bits where he adds in the complications of life. Far too often we assume that stories of the rape of children, for example, are simple and that if someone has been doing this for a long time, and they haven’t been immediately caught, there had to have been an elaborate coverup. But it is not just that we delay believing people could possibly do such things beyond the point where this becomes at all reasonable (something I think that is almost certainly true) but also that we also doubt our own sanity when confronted with ‘evidence’ that seems to imply sport’s coaches or Cardinals could possibly do such things – even when that evidence comes from our own eyes. A dear friend of mine posted on Facebook recently an elaborate telephone scam she was nearly the victim of that was designed to get her to transfer money out of her account and into someone else’s. What was remarkable about this was how professional the whole thing was and how patient the scammers were. We are pre-programmed to trust people, and that isn’t a bad thing. As Gladwell makes clear with a couple of counter-examples in this book, where people end up distrusting everyone, and how their lives quickly become unliveable. As Socrates said, it is better to suffer an injury than to cause one – obviously, he meant that in terms of our souls – and I think this proves just as true today.What is particularly interesting about this book is the notion that most of what happens in the world is ‘contextual’. There is a long discussion of campus rape cases and the problems that excessive drinking can cause, not merely since people end up diminished memories of what happened, even if not diminished responsibility for what happened. But this is then compared with other cultures were excessive drinking does not lead to rape or violence. Similarly, the case of Silvia Plath is discussed and whether she would have committed suicide in some other way if town gas had been replaced with natural gas sooner. We often think suicide is something that you would only do after some serious consideration, that it is the ultimate in elaborate and decisive decision making – but often the opposite can be the case. Rather than being elaborately planned, often people who attempt suicide and who fortuitously live after the attempt say that what actually happened was that the opportunity presented itself and they aren’t all that sure why, but they took that opportunity. We humans are deeply strange, much more so than we generally give ourselves credit for. Like so much else in life, we often act first and provide a reasonable sounding motive later.The bit of this that is probably worth the cover price of the book is the discussion of the word puzzle thing close to the start. People are given some words with some of the letters replaced with blanks and they have to fill those blanks to make actual words. The finished words might end up being ‘cheat, scare, trap’ stuff like that. But then the shrink giving the task asks, ‘so, what do you reckon that list of words says about you? It doesn’t seem terribly flattering.’ To which you are likely to reply, ‘well, I think it says nothing about me, it’s just the literary equivalent of a jigsaw puzzle.’ So far, all well and good. Except, when you show people photos of other people and then tell them how these others filled in the blanks – and the words they came up with – they have no trouble at all at being able to identify the psychological issues these people clearly suffer from given the words they generated. This is, of course, a long standing finding and is just one instance of an all-too-human set of conclusions we find ourselves jumping to – even after having just explained why the same thing couldn’t possibly apply to our-good-selves. We can’t help ourselves in finding that people like us are infinitely complex and must be understood from within that complexity – while people who are not like us are simple and behave in accordance to the stereotypes we hold of them. This is interesting book, although, clearly with the provisos I’ve mentioned about what a stranger might look like. "
20,0316478520,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4125660-liz,3,"I never would have picked up this book if it hadn’t been a book club selection. So, Gladwell starts off by saying we are horribly bad at sussing out liars from our face to face interactions. Of course, my initial thought was that explains why Trump loves Putin and Kim Jong Un. Gladwell’s basic premise is that humans have a default setting to believe others and in order to believe someone is lying there has to be a lot of unexplainable circumstances. So, while it’s easy to think you’d never fall for a scam, this explains why so often intelligent people do exactly that. He posits that even if you have doubts, there has to be a high threshold of doubts before you stop believing someone, especially someone you know. Some of the chapters make for uncomfortable reading. Two of the examples he cites in making his case are the delays in prosecuting Jerry Sandusky and Dr. Nassar. Especially with the former, he seems to spend more time picking apart the prosecution’s case than actually proving his premise. Another chapter tackles the date rape issue which seems to be so common these days. Forget Gladwell’s argument. The scariest part of this chapter was reading how much binge drinking young adults are engaging in and the prevalence of blackouts. I had some problems with this book. When discussing Sandra Bland's arrest, he totally glosses over whether the officer was racist. To lay the blame totally at the feet of the police culture seemed simplistic. And in the case of the date rape chapter, he tries to lay blame equally upon victim and the rapist. So, while he makes some interesting points which I think are valid, he undercuts his arguments and left me feeling queasy. "
21,0316478520,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2527265-david,4,"I'm glad that those nice people at Goodreads chose me randomly to receive an old-school paper copy of this book, free of charge. It will be a novel feeling to actually have read a controversial book before it hits the shelves and generates the predictably shallow hot takes in the few moments before the world's attention moves onto something else.Perhaps I'm engaging in a display of unwarranted optimism to think that a mere book can have an effect on the way people think, but this is what Talking to Strangers attempts to do, to its credit. I lump this book in with two others I've read recently (see here and here) which champion or criticize attempts to find “third way” solutions to our problems. This pretty damn eccentric book actually only directly addresses its main issue in the initial and concluding five percent or so of the text. The rest is a long trip through apparently (at first) unrelated phenomena (including Cuba-US relations, Amanda Knox, and waterboarding) before returning to the main point.Reading books about third ways is an exercise in optimism, because third way books imply that there are always new and interesting ways to look at old problems. (In addition, as the Long-Suffering Wife (LSW) recently said, “Reading Malcolm Gladwell always makes you feel smart.”) Since I suffer a chronic deficit of optimism, I am constantly mainlining any literature which seems to say that the world could be a better place, non-fiction or no.The issue which gets the third way treatment here is the alarming number of police traffic stops in the US which end up with someone (usually the driver of the car) dead. This is a problem which is ripe for a third way analysis, because as it stands now it seems like you either must be in the tribe that says “Police are racists” or the tribe that says “Liberals are apologists for criminals”.I admire Gladwell for defying the large number of people who are so vested in one of these orthodoxies that he will no doubt find, for years to come, his Twitter feed polluted with poorly-proofread denunciations of everything he has ever done or said.Sometimes Gladwell demonstrates an obvious truth so clearly that you are almost ashamed to be surprised by it, like when he describes an psychology experiment which demonstrates that while most of us regard ourselves as creatures of unknowable complexity and depth of character, we also tend to engage in ridiculous reductions of the personalities of others into easy-to-dismiss stereotypes based on the flimsiest of evidence.On the other hand, reading Gladwell means spending a lot of time saying to yourself, “Hey, wait a minute, what about [fill in thing you know a little something about here]?” For example, Gladwell has a long chapter about someone who managed to be a mole for Cuban intelligence in the US bureaucracy for many years. Having toiled in the vineyards of the sprawling federal bureaucracy myself, I felt that Gladwell missed some very important details about how people act there, and why. Without getting into too much spoiler-ish detail, I think Gladwell doesn't really understand the intensity with which fecal matters rains down on those who rock the boat here in the nation's capital, a factor that certainly influenced the events he narrates. Overall, though, I was very happy to have been gifted this smart book and look forward to seeing if the world can, for once, defy my grouchy pessimism and actually allow a mere book to increase the amount of understanding in world and improve how we live. "
22,0316478520,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,4,"This is a wonderful book about major issues when talking to people. I thought, initially, that the book would be about everyday conversations during everyday interactions. Not at all. The book is really about the assumptions that we make about other people, and how those assumptions can be drastically wrong. It is about belief systems, and how we react when we encounter evidence that is contrary to those beliefs. Malcolm Gladwell took me into worlds that I had never even considered.The main point in the book is that ""You believe in something not because you have no doubts, but because you don't have enough doubts."" There is an excellent story about Ana Montes, an agent for the Defense Intelligence Agency. She received glowing performance reviews over the years, despite the fact that she was a Cuban spy. Fidel Castro personally gave he a medal as an award for her activities. But despite the fact that her boyfriend worked for the Pentagon, and her brother and sister both worked for the FBI. She was interviewed in detail, and there were a few hints that she was a spy. Yet, nobody suspected that she was a spy, and when she was arrested, her coworkers were in disbelief. It's not that nobody had doubts--nobody had enough doubts.Judges try to estimate the probability of defendants' recidivism. They want to look at the defendants' faces, and hear their attitudes. The problem is, judges do not do as good a job at predicting recidivism as computers, which only take into account cold, hard facts, and obviously don't take appearance and demeanor into account.A concept known as coupling is very interesting. The suicide rate in an English town decreased dramatically when the town switched from coal gas to natural gas. The switch made it almost impossible to commit suicide using the gas that was supplied to homes. People did not want to use less convenient modes of suicide. Similar reductions in suicide rates have been found in other environments. It is inferred that if handguns were outlawed in the U.S., there would be 10,000 fewer suicides per year.The only thing I don't like about this book, is that the topics seem to be scatter-shot. The topics covered are not only about talking to strangers. They cover a wide range of topics, and do not seem to have an overall theme. For example, the topic of coupling doesn't seem to have anything at all to do with talking to strangers. Why was this topic (and others) included in the book? Only because it is an interesting psychological phenomenon. "
23,0316478520,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58889295-kimber,2,"Gladwell writes this like he has A.D.D. He's all over the place, an historian trying to be entertaining? Perhaps, but I prefer a more cohesive approach. Much of the book is based on the theory that most people default to seeing the best in others and are unable to see the bad. And in other cases, they think someone is guilty simply because their personality is off in some way. This theory fits in best with the Amanda Knox case (clearly innocent) but he tries to fit it in with the cases of Jerry Sandusky and Larry Nassar, criminal pedophiles who went years before they were stopped. Because the people around these cases defaulted to seeing the good in others? What about the fact that nobody wanted to do anything about it? These allegations went to the top of the chain, university presidents who did nothing and Gladwell questions the reader, ""would you have done any different? ""Well, some of us do. The simple reason nothing was done is because those people chose not to stick their necks out to stop abuse from happening. This isn't ""giving someone the benefit of the doubt ""(Gladwell) They lacked the courage to do what is right. ""Defaulting to see the good in others"" may be correct, to an extent, but it's overblown here.The Sandra Bland case was worth reading in itself. This was clearly a tragedy. But there was more to it than ""talking to strangers."" The officer never once admitted it had anything to do with Sandra being a black woman and he tried to say they were in a high crime area which wasn't true. I appreciated how he shed some light on the suicides of Sylvia Plath and Anne Sexton. And the best take away from the book is the conclusion (based on the studies) that you never can tell what someone is feeling based on their facial expression. The most interesting part of the book was in how we tend to see the good in people who are criminals and see guilt in people who are innocent simply because we rely on certain social cues & body language to see integrity in a person or deception,truth or lies. Hence, the nervous girl who everyone thought was lying. And Bernie Madoff: a wolf in sheep's clothing. People size up others hastily & then are shocked when the truth comes out & in hindsight the red flags come back to them. I just wish Gladwell had more control over his narrative & it didn't feel so disjointed to me. He ends on a weak note, hasn't drawn conclusions (not really) & it all kind of falls flat for me."
24,0316478520,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22699228-matthew-quann,4,"My wife and I listened to this audiobook on two drives separated by about four months. I'm an IMMENSE fan of Gladwell's Revisionist History podcast (seriously, give it a listen) and was pretty jazzed to hear that he had decided to take a podcast-like approach for this book. So, instead of Gladwell's soothing voice at all times there's interviews, court readings, etc. It doesn't always work as well as the podcast does--I wish there were more of Gladwell in conversation with his subjects, he's a compelling interviewer--but it does an excellent job approximating it.I was pretty disappointed in Gladwell's last book, David & Goliath, which felt disjointed and didn't have the spark that ignited his past works. Luckily, Talking to Strangers is a return to form and tackles some controversial stories ripped from the headlines of the past few years. Gladwell covers black lives matter, the Jerry Sandusky rape case, some cool Cold War spy stories, Amanda Knox's infamous murder trial, and a host of other stories held together by a failure in communication.More specifically, Gladwell is interested in the ways in which we fail to accurately assess strangers. Using the aforementioned examples as well as others he dissects where it all went wrong and what cognitive biases prevent us from seeing through falsehoods and misrepresentation. My wife and I were both taken by the Sandra Bland case that opens and closes the book. I think there's a tendency to view the evidence Gladwell presents on the basis of pre-established political views. But Gladwell does a great job of turning it back and forth and viewing the interaction through multiple lenses. It adds depth to a story that requires it and does more justice to it than would a quick headline. There's some shortcomings in the book: rarely does Gladwell address race and gender, but I don't think that those topics are entirely central his thesis. To that point, there's lots of good nonfiction on the shelves these days that tackle those topics with greater depth and it just seems as if it is territory Gladwell didn't want to wade into. Fair enough! It just seems like there's greater understanding to be had from a more in depth look at how those factors influence his ideas about communication and its failures.Even when Gladwell fails to convince me, he's always got my attention. He's a terrific storyteller and I could listen to him prattle on about almost anything. Despite Revisionist History being my favourite thing Gladwell is producing these days, this book is also a winner. It spurred on some cool conversations between my wife and I, plus we can be kind of picky about audiobooks and this one was an out-and-out family winner. Even though this tackles some of the darkest subject matter that I can recall Gladwell working with, it ends with a message I think is largely optimistic. Great stuff, definite audiobook recommendation."
25,0316478520,http://goodreads.com/user/show/279256-diane,3,"This is another fascinating book by Malcolm Gladwell, who likes to group a variety of topics under one overarching theme. This writing strategy is a clever one, because it basically guarantees there will be at least one or two case studies you'll find interesting.I read this book back in April, and even then I was drawn to Gladwell's discussion of police tactics, and how law enforcement disproportionately targets black people in America. Gladwell opens his book with the case of Sandra Bland, a black woman who was arrested during a traffic stop in Texas back in 2015, and was later found dead in her jail cell. The audiobook includes the actual recording of Bland's encounter with the state trooper, and it's infuriating. If the officer hadn't come up with a flimsy excuse to pull her over and arrest her, Bland might still be alive today.What I appreciated about Gladwell's treatment of the Bland story is that he goes back and looks at criminology studies from decades ago, explaining the field research (and its gross misapplication) that has led to police pulling over black drivers at much higher rates than white drivers. *Note: I've been embarrassingly slow to write book reviews lately, but the discussion of racist police tactics coincides nicely with the Black Lives Matter protests going on across the country and around the world. Some other topics in the book that I found interesting were Neville Chamberlain's meeting with Hitler, Fidel Castro's infiltration of the CIA, how Bernie Madoff managed to scam so many investors, and the bizarre trial of Amanda Knox in Italy.I listened to ""Talking to Strangers"" on audio, and I would highly recommend the format because Gladwell included a lot of actual recordings and interviews, so it was produced more like a multimedia podcast than a straight audiobook narration. "
26,0316478520,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8101737-peter-tillman,3,"Off to a rousing start, and written to Gladwell's usual high standards. He does his homework, and surprises us at many turns. The Nature review that follows is full & fair. I doubt that I will find anything substantial to add. But I didn't end up liking the book as much as I expected. 3.5 stars, rounded down for the wandering and discursive narrative, and the inconclusive & disappointing ending.So: read Nature's review first, and if you are intrigued, and especially if you have liked Gladwell's previous books, you should try this one. I did both, and ended up a bit disappointed. But it's still a worthwhile book, and I learned quite a lot. I skimmed most of the drunken student sex-crime stuff, and I'm not sure why he spent so much time on the Penn State coach and flagrant pederast. Well, the latter does show why the coach's bosses defaulted to believing his defenses, until the evidence of his guilt became overwhelming. And their hesitation came back to bite them in the ass, big time!His thesis that our predisposition to believe and trust strangers is essential to the functioning of our open, wealthy society -- even though it leads to injuries and injustice to a (usually small) minority. Who sometimes get redress, even if (often) years later. And he tells some heartbreaking stories. So I may change my mind and round up to 4 stars. Today, though, I'm rounding down. 😎“Those occasions when our trusting nature is violated are tragic,” Gladwell writes, and repeats for emphasis. “But the alternative — to abandon trust as a defense against predation and deception — is worse.”Nature's review: https://www.nature.com/articles/d4158...Excerpt:In 1996, an operative in the US Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) — Ana Belén Montes, known as “the Queen of Cuba” for her specialist knowledge — was suspected of being a double agent. A counter-intelligence officer, reviewing her file, decided that she had passed the test: “This woman is gonna be the next Director of Intelligence for DIA. She’s just fabulous.” She was arrested in 2001.She was not even a particularly accomplished spy, Gladwell notes. Her secret codes from Havana were in her purse, her shortwave radio in a shoebox in her cupboard. “The issue with spies is not that there is something brilliant about them,” Gladwell writes. “It is that there is something wrong with us.”"
27,0316478520,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43171956-robin-bonne,1,"Clearly the author has never been sexually assaulted. If you find reading graphic descriptions of rape and pedophelia upsetting, this isn’t a book you’ll enjoy. The author is dismissive of rape victims. He concludes that the people who protect predators and disbelief rape victims are “defaulting to truth.” There were several times he defends the people who protected pedophiles like Jerry Sandusky and Nassar. This section of the book was horribly disgusting. His “default truth” in this case means disbelieving victims. "
28,0316478520,http://goodreads.com/user/show/80316998-howard,4,3.5 Stars for Talking to Strangers (audiobook) by Malcolm Gladwell read by the author. I’m not sure what I think about this book. I didn’t research what the book was about before listening. I just went by the title and the author. I’ve read a couple of his books and enjoyed them. I find Gladwell’s writing insightful and well researched. This was too but it seemed like huge stretch to tie all of these stories together and trying to put them under the title of Talking to Strangers. It just seemed off to me. 
29,0316478520,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31506695-david-wineberg,4,"Malcolm Gladwell’s latest foray into human folly is its seemingly innate trust in strangers. We assume strangers are transparent, and can take what they do and say at face value. Sometimes we are wrong, but assuming everyone is evil is far worse. Talking To Strangers focuses (mostly) on a number of very high profile criminal cases we are all likely to be familiar with. They include the Amanda Knox case, the Jerry Sandusky case, the Brock Turner case, the Sandra Bland case, Khalid Sheik Mohammed, and the Bernie Madoff case. Gladwell looks at them differently. He looks at them not from simple guilt or innocence, but from the misread signals that have surrounded them. The result can be a ruined life, prison or even death, unearned. On the other side (the investigator side), they can result in self-delusion, missed opportunities and complete wastes of time achieving nothing. It’s an imperfection he exploits repeatedly throughout the book.It all hinges on the notion of transparency, what people assume about strangers just by looking at them. Judges make decision about bail, college students make decisions about having sex, investigators make assumptions about guilt – all just by looking and talking to strangers. Gladwell shows we do pretty poorly, especially compared to machines given raw data. Systems have a far better record of assigning or withholding bail, for example. Judges, even after decades of experience, fool themselves daily.There is a side trip into coupling, where people fixate on something. In his chapter on the suicide of Sylvia Plath, he examines the role of town gas, saturated with carbon monoxide, which was the favorite method of suicide until it was phased out in favor of natural gas. As it disappeared, the suicide rate plunged. If people didn’t have their town gas, they didn’t kill themselves. They did not, as expected, look for alternatives. It was town gas, or nothing. Similarly, the Golden Gate Bridge is a favorite suicide tool, even though faster and easier methods are readily available.Gladwell discovers that different cultures appreciate facial expressions differently. There are no real universals. He finds that people default to trusting others unless they know them already. Otherwise we would all be like television Vikings, constantly killing each other for lack of trust.Talking To Strangers feels incomplete and unsatisfying. It’s no news to anyone that first impressions might not prove correct. It’s why it takes five to ten years for a marriage to break up, or months for a teenage relationship. How people we thought we knew could turn out to be evil on some level. We feel betrayed (but we betrayed ourselves). Suspension of disbelief (a term Gladwell does use at any point in the book) means we ignore the defects and faults we are presented with, and assume the best for this stranger. Later, those same faults become intolerable. But we know this.Oddly, he does not examine American gun culture as substitute for this normal transparency and trust.He discovers that alcohol doesn’t reveal, it transforms. There are good drunks and bad drunks, good trips and bad trips. The real you is not revealed by alcohol; you become a stranger to yourself. We drink so much more per session today that blackouts have become common and even measurable and predictable. Drink too much and your brain shuts down so you remember nothing. You leave yourself in the hands of a complete stranger – yourself. This is also not news.Still and as usual, Gladwell is easy to read. He packs his pages with these fascinating sidelights, and confirms much of what we have always suspected. Too trusting is being gullible. Non-trusting means a monster.The most clear and chilling example he gives was the Ana Montes case, in which a Cuban intelligence mole worked her way up through the US security establishment with such great accomplishments and accolades that no one suspected her, despite the gigantic clues and traceable events. Leaks followed her everywhere. It was a case of suspension of disbelief as clear and dramatic as a teenager watching a terrible sci-fi flick. The CIA counterintelligence officer in charge, who finally outed her and stopped the hemorrhaging, kicks himself for not putting 2+2 together years earlier. The best quote comes in the Khalid Sheik Mohammed case. Years of torture, both physical and psychological led Mohammed to finally confess. He confessed to pretty much everything in the world. The investigators began to think he was puffing himself up for posterity, knowing under no circumstances would he ever be set free. It made them (as so many have before them) rethink torture: “Trying to get information out of someone you are sleep-depriving is sort of like trying to get a better signal out of a radio that you are smashing with a sledgehammer.…It makes no sense to me at all.” But we carry on, regardless. Gladwell has great command of his thoughts. He handles his subject with comfort and ease. He will take you down strange paths and bring you back when he’s ready. And not before. So while it might be incomplete, it is engaging and entertaining.In the end, Gladwell has so immersed himself in the Sandra Bland case and the psychology and tactics at every level, that he can explain it way beyond simply a cop gone bad. He says according to the known science he has explained, the police should not have been making stops on that stretch of road, and not in broad daylight. That the directions of management to make as many stops as possible was wrong, as was the police manual on obtaining and maintaining control over suspects. Mostly, from the context of this book, the officer took all the clues he found – an out of state license, an aggravated driver, fast food wrappers on the floor, no other keys on the keychain, failure to put out a cigarette on command – as nefarious instead of ordinary. He was trained to do the opposite of what we all do innately: assume truth and transparency in a stranger. That drivers should not be suspects; they are simply strangers. While that might let the occasional bad guy get away, the pain for treating everybody as a suspect is the kind of thing that can stop human society in its tracks. Our fundamental baseline must lean toward assuming transparency and trust. It is a necessary illusion.David Wineberg"
30,0316478520,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5935491-tanja-berg,4,"I started reading this book right after I had managed a social gaffe - or so I thought. After I separated from my husband this summer, I started dancing swing. Not to look for anything, but to get out of the house and learn something new. Most of the people at the course were in pairs or retirees. Except a boy in his 30’s. We started talking and we started going to the dance evenings on Wednesdays in addition to the Monday classes. I would dance with others, but he would only dance with me. So I eventually interpreted this as interest and came on pretty strong with ambiguous results. After I thought, “oh lord, I misread”. A week of silence followed.I started reading this book and apparently misreading people is really very common - particularly in regards to sexual interest. We really are clueless as to what the subject of our interest might really want. Another Wednesday came along and the situation is no longer ambiguous. Either it just needed more time to mature or I just to the inner swing of a turn we were going around anyway.Malcolm Gladwell takes us through real cases of misunderstandings and shows us how we misinterpret strangers. Life isn’t a “Friends” episode and people are not transparent.Here’s another example: at work I am told I am easy to read. I took a moment to consider this. It’s a part of my authenticity and part of my constructed image. What I say and do and feel needs to match. It makes others perceive me as safe. I need them to believe me or I cannot lead. That doesn’t me I can’t hide what I’m feeling, but most of the time being transparent serves my purpose. We don’t do well with “mismatched” people. Nervous truth tellers or calm liars. We default to the truth. People trained to detect lies do worse than lay people in detecting the mismatched. That’s a scary thought. Best to behave according to expectations. This book definitely gave me some new insights, many more than the few tidbits laid bare here. Definitely recommended! "
31,0316478520,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5181592-ankit-garg,2,"Talking to Strangers by Malcolm Gladwell is a feeble attempt to make sense of what goes wrong when we communicate with strangers. The author has put together a few anecdotes and then tried to make sense of what went wrong during the conversation among the strangers in question, thus trying hard to drive his point home.Most of the conclusions he draws seem far fetched. In many cases, it appeared that he was trying to draw conclusions to suit his theory, conveniently skipping the parts that might hint at something totally opposite.The only thing I liked about the book were the incidents themselves. There were quite many which I was not aware of. The book introduced me to them, thus leading me to do my on research on them to know more details about those stories.Thanks to the author and the publisher for the ARC.Verdict: Skip this one."
32,0316478520,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75748905-elizabeth,3,"We are bad lie-detectors, we routinely misjudge others, and we forget the context of a situation when we really shouldn’t, Malcolm Gladwell says. So basically, we overestimate our competence in social interactions and blame our errors on the wrong things. Is that so surprising? Not really, but as plausible as it seems, we continue to repeat mistakes and misinterpret numerous scenarios. Seemingly unrelated cases point to the possibility—and more disputably, a need—for an alternate explanation.  In Talking to Strangers, Gladwell focuses on a number of high-profile case studies or well-known examples: Sandra Bland, Hitler, CIA double-agents in Cuba, Bernie Madoff, Jerry Sandusky, the Stanford rape case, and Amanda Knox. I wouldn’t dream of finding the common patterns between them all, but Gladwell approaches this with a TED-talk-like verve. Am I convinced by all of this? No, I will not wholeheartedly believe that Hitler duped Chamberlain and not Churchill because the former was not a stranger to Hitler and the latter was. Did I also feel myself nodding along to powerful research findings that overturned some preconceptions? Yes. It is hard to be satisfied by ambivalence, but I am ultimately willing to maintain skepticism and appreciate new thinking if I find I’ve been presented with interesting tidbits that support some compelling theories. Buttressed by psychology theories old and new, Gladwell discusses the pros and cons of defaulting to the truth and how we mistakenly believe we can divine the truth of people’s behavior better than we actually can. Gladwell has a habit of speaking in simple but evocative terms so that you feel smart and enlightened, despite the inherent reality of missing key pieces that are de-emphasized for simplicity’s sake. In one of his more convoluted theories on coupling, he draws a positive correlation between gas stoves and suicide rates in England. As strong of a correlation as could be found for fewer gas stoves and fewer suicides, it is still a correlation, not a causation, and certainly not the whole picture. Or when he discusses a police officer stopping, Gladwell claims that stopping Sandra Bland, a black woman, was not about race. He sacrifices the complexity of integrating racism in favor of championing the new framing mechanism: that the police officer had a misunderstanding due to making an assumption about her demeanor. What I still like about reading Gladwell’s books is that they expand my toolkit to better understand human behavior in the world in a digestible narrative. He makes me think and question what I know, which is ultimately the most valuable. He never offers a prescription that feels flawless enough for me to wholeheartedly adopt, but he does adjust the lens so that we have more information and less misconceptions moving forward. By no means a full picture, Gladwell has given us a second, third, or perhaps fourth way of looking at familiar problems we confront in the face of strangers. 
The thing we want to learn about a stranger is fragile. If we tread carelessly it will crumple under our feet... The right way to talk to strangers is with caution and humility.

33,0316478520,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43708514-candie,4,"3.5 stars.I really enjoy Malcolm Gladwell's books. I enjoy his writing style a lot and his books are so thought provoking. He leaves you thinking about things you never would have thought about, in ways you never would have considered. I like how he gets you to look at things from different perspectivesI am torn on this book. I did really enjoy reading it but I did not agree with everything he said, especially in the areas regarding racism and sexual abuse. The situation involving Sandra Bland he would have us conclude that the officer was just doing the job that the higher ups trained him to do so the fault should be with the people who implement these tactics. I agree that the tactics need to be reviewed, but I don't think that they explain the officers choices in this situation. I see no reason why he should have ever tried to physically force her from her car in any way. Not to mention that he escalated to power really quickly and it appeared to be more about his pride because she was arguing with him. I think there was a lot of truth in much of the things he talked about such as how we naturally default to truth as it is the more likely situation. We can totally miss or ignore something that is right in front of our faces because that something rarely happens. So we reason it away. It couldn't be that. Also, how we judge and evaluate people and feel like we can read people or know what they are all about and we often have it all wrong. We don't think people have us all figured out though because we are very complex and our thoughts and actions are based around so much; others are just as complex. I also feel like in this book he made some generalizations that I didn't feel fit in order to make his point and he oversimplifies some things and made some people's actions seem okay based on miscommunication, when they very clearly were not okay. Suicide being coupled seemed a bit oversimplified. I mean he had a chart showing data that once the type of gas in stoves were changed, suicide rates went down. So he concluded that people only wanted to commit suicide in that way; once that way was taken away the majority of people no longer would. This leaves out so many variables and I think greatly oversimplifies the data. I'm not saying he is wrong but there didn't seem to be any mention of any further study to see if he was right. What if death by suicide was just more obvious in that way? Maybe people who committed suicide by taking pills were just mislabeled as an overdose? Or people who committed suicide by driving into a big truck or off a cliff were just mislabeled as car accidents? I don't know that this is the case either, I'm just saying it seems to be a bit of a post hoc fallacy to me. This book left me with so much to think about and I had to stop many times to just think about or research topics or ideas further. Although there was much I didn't necessarily agree with, I still found it very interesting and I really did enjoy reading it and couldn't put it down. I will definitely read another book by him if he comes out with one."
34,0316478520,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27298436-toni,4,"In Talking to Strangers, I believe all Malcolm really wants to tell us, is everything our parents use to tell us: 1. Don’t believe everything you read in the papers (or in magazines, or the internet.) 2. Trust only family, not strangers; but be careful everywhere. 3. Don’t believe anything anyone tells you until you check it out first. (This could’ve meant, ask Mom and/or Dad, go to the library, ask someone we know and is smart.)Most people have their default setting at TRUST; we want to believe you; we really want you to tell us the truth, and we really hope that’s what you’re doing. We have high hopes! And if you grew up in America you just can’t help being positive and optimistic. Well, most people, not all.Growing up in New Jersey, in a second-generation, Italian American family; our default setting was SKEPTICAL; meaning you have to prove yourself trustworthy first. My parents would try to figure out if someone was lying rather than discuss the topic. That’s what their immigrant parents taught them. (Living in NJ just added to sarcasm.) I taught my kids the same thing; never believe someone at face value, consider your source first. Then try to figure out what they’re asking or telling you, based on what you already know. THINK!Obviously, Malcolm delves deeper into why we trust strangers, and why we initially believe them. What cues are we missing, what didn’t we hear, what in their tone didn’t I pick up on?! As is his way, Malcolm brings several nationally known examples and valuable research to explain why and how this happens, frequently.The case that stuck with me the most is the Sandra Bland case in Texas, from 2015. The case where the young officer stopped her for a minor traffic error, but because she acted nervous, he thought she was hiding something and misread as suspicious. He bullied her every action, ending up pulling her out of the car, to ground in cuffs. She died three days later, in jail, by suicide. Malcolm describes the entire encounter, case, and final trial in the book. (In the audio, which is excellent, Malcolm plays all original recordings; such as this encounter.) This story alone is worth reading this book! My opinion. Many examples you will recognize are discussed, theories are raised and labeled. No need for me to list them here; better to encounter them with the case they match, and Malcolm’s words to describe them. Very interesting book wanders some here and there, but solid. Superb audio.Thank you Netgalley, Little, Brown and Co. and Malcolm Gladwell"
35,0316478520,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4261551-jen,1,"Despite the criticisms lobbed at Malcolm Gladwell's books for years – I enjoyed them growing up. But holy f*ck he missed the boat on this one. I was at first skeptical, then alarmed, then full-on rage-reading, until finally, exhausted and disappointed.Talking to Strangers follows the classic Gladwell formula: weave a compelling narrative using several case studies to underscore the main thesis—which seems to be that interactions with strangers are difficult due to highly subjective, ""mismatched"" interpretations. OK that's fine, but in an attempt to be ~rational~ the author falls into the classic traps in a number of these examples — and ends up defending/excusing Brock Turner, Joe Paterno (from Jerry Sandusky case), Amanda Knox, and the cop in the Sandra Bland case (the black woman who was arrested then found dead in her jail cell). The level of rationalizations to fit the narrative—that each one of these stories is about a misunderstanding, really! It all just comes down to *~communication~*—is flabbergasting. Gladwell's personal defendants' words are taken at face value, and there's little analysis on the complexities of each of these stories. Race can't POSSIBLY have played a factor because well, the cop *says* it didn't (YES IT DID). The Penn officials who were convicted for obstruction of justice/child endangerment for not reporting the accusations can't be blamed because, well, it's what any of us would have done (NO IT'S NOT) The Stanford rape case is really only about alcohol and not rape culture, because Turner claims he had consent—these crazy kids! (WHY ISN'T IT CONSIDERED A POSSIBILITY THAT HE WAS LYING, SUCH AS WHEN THE INVESTIGATION FOUND THAT HE WAS CHANGING HIS STORY UPON LEARNING THAT THE VICTIM HAD NO MEMORIES OF THE INCIDENT)Though ostensibly about navigating conflict with strangers—sure, it's a topic more important than ever—it seems like the book isn't actually interested in it. Instead, the book seems like a vanity exercise for the author to reconcile his own confusion about several high-profile cases of the last few years. And he's chosen to resolve that cognitive dissonance by applying empathy on the perpetrators, and joining the fray of blaming the disempowered, silent, or dead victims. It's ""why can't we all just get along?""/tone-policing, because actually listening to the painful truths is too hard—it would forces us to update our rules on moral gray areas. This kind of distress is understandable, nearly universal. But giving it a platform via a book legitimizes and amplifies the far larger contributor to the original problem: maybe we're bad at talking to strangers, not b/c of misunderstandings, but this type of drivel that is getting increasingly championed by group like the alt-right. On the surface, the argument of ""silly humans, so prone to misunderstanding!"" — sure it makes you sound smart, but in reality it's oversimplified logic, cherry-picking, self-rationalizing at its worst that's far more harmful than it appears. I used to be a fan but I'm done.I realize this review is only half coherent b/c ugh I'm so mad"
36,0316478520,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15796185-nisha-menon,3,"Malcolm Gladwell is a smooth guy. You know the kind. That popular would-have-been-a-jock-if-sporty, but had to embrace the cool geekish vibe guy. The kind that you brush of as average-looking initially but before you know it, him and his glasses start growing on you. The extrovert who hides in an introverts clothing. That guy.He writes like he looks.Now that's not a bad thing. There's a reason guys like that are popular. They're not dull. The book is engaging even in parts where you roll your eyes at the obvious generalizations. So pick this book up if you're looking for something with the trending cute podcast guru vibe. If you're in it to understand how to talk to strangers better, let me save you the trouble. He dedicates a line at the end to answer this question: Approach a stranger with humility and without any preconceived notions. See, this would look pretty on a poster but it isn't an actionable insight. For most of the book, he addresses 3 bits where we go wrong when dealing with strangers.1. We tend to assume that the stranger is telling us the truth. Even when faced with certain doubts, we don't act upon them because we don't have enough red flags. So spies hiding amongst us, pedophiles in the garb of doctors and even Hitler has a field day pulling one over diplomats.2. Don't paint everybody based on your limited experience with the world. Fear doesn't wear the same expression on all our faces. So try not to let preconceived notions of what people are supposed to act like influence your judgment.The deck is already stacked against us. When you add situations where your other instincts also take a beating, you're setting yourself up as a target. For instance, frat parties and giddy drunk people are not places conducive to meeting strangers as our judgment is heavily impaired. 3. Certain behaviors are coupled to particular places and things. We're already quite shoddy at pegging a stranger right. But we confidently box all strangers with sweeping statements. Take crime and suicide for example, data shows that they are linked or coupled to specific places and conditions. Outside of these contexts, the rates of both go down. So when you confront a stranger, take into account the time and place.Frustratingly enough, Gladwell soon outlines what happens when people are taught instead to distrust a stranger at first glance than following their instincts and trusting them. He talks about police officers using unwarranted force on strangers because they've been trained to be wary of them. The conclusion he reaches is an uncomfortable one. Lies are hard to detect even for ones trained to do so, so folks like us will hardly ever get it right. But we have to make peace with that. Because the alternative is a world where we will never be able to trust one another or function as a unit. In fact, the whole truth is something we might never get, even if we apply force, as memory and mind can reshape what the truth looks like under duress. So our best bet is to approach with open-mindedness and respect for the diversity of circumstances people come from.Phew! I should've just stuck to a youtube summary of this book but oh, well. I have a thing for the geeky, cute, I-have-it-all-figured-out dude. I don't mind the occasional Gladwell book. It makes for fun dinner table conversation."
37,0316478520,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19133785-brandon-forsyth,3,"I really like Malcolm Gladwell, and I think some of his writing belongs in the Hall of Fame, but it’s hard to read this book and not feel like he’s sort of missed the point. No chapter on race? No chapter on gender? I can (maybe) understand trying to look beyond those things to the root of what makes us so bad at interacting with other people, but it feels like many of the examples he’s taken here (Sandra Bland in particular) have huge factors of sexism and racism that are key to understanding the interactions. Mr. Gladwell instead overlooks those factors to focus in on the minutiae of what else might have been happening in these interactions, and the result is either something slight and inconsequential or shockingly naive."
38,0316478520,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20955173-sean-gibson,3,"Not Gladwell’s best work—it’s a little intellectually lazy and doesn’t really drive to an actionable, meaningful, or particularly cogent conclusion. Still, there are a few make-you-think nuggets here and there, and Gladwell remains an eminently readable stylist. Still, this feels like a wasted opportunity. Or, maybe it should have been, say, a podcast instead of a book. We'll round up from 2.5 stars. "
39,0316478520,http://goodreads.com/user/show/86566-rachel,3,"I’m always fascinated and provoked by Gladwell’s work—this book is no exception. But there are some big leaps here that make me itchy. Still processing. Bottom line: We’re generally terrible at understanding the actions of strangers, and when things take a turn for the worse/unexpected, we blame the stranger. Got it. Feel it. And I like how Gladwell sheds light on the Sandra Bland case. The section on Brock Turner? It troubled me. "
40,0316478520,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2644090-erica,2,"As you can see, the title of this book is Talking to Strangers: What We Should Know about the People We Don't Know. I started out on board with whatever I was supposed to be learning but by the end I was side-eyeing this book with acrid peevishness. I did not feel I learned anything new about the people I don't know, except for maybe the people discussed in the various scandals throughout the story. Also, I am no better equipped to talk to strangers and, despite what Gladwell vehemently states at the very end, that this is not an anti-trust-people book!, I feel justified in not trusting people and want to become even more paranoid. The title may be misleading to some readers.This was a hard read due to content. I was uncomfortable listening to ""This person did a horrible thing but here is why and how they were able to carry on with their nefarious ways for as long as they did."" It was hard to hear about Jerry Sandusky and Larry Nassar sexually abusing children, about Brock Turner and campus alcoholism, about political prisoners' torture, and especially about Officer Encinia arresting Sandra Bland. I don't feel these events were shared in a salacious manner but I don't think they were shared in a compassionate manner, either. They also had an apologetic overtone, often aimed at men - Federal intelligence officers aren't to blame for not being able to tell when a spy is among their ranks, the president of Penn State isn't to blame for his employee raping children, the parents aren't to blame for not believing their children who said they were being abused, Brock Turner isn't to blame for his impaired judgement because alcohol is the main reason mistakes were made. However, the main focus in most of the examples is the behavior of the perpetrators and the subsequent reactions of second-hand participants involved in each event, from the parents of abused gymnasts to the two Swedish students who chased Brock Turner when he up and ran from an unconscious woman. I suppose on one hand, maybe this detachment is appropriate but, on the other, this isn't a scientific look at crime, it's simply a theory about why people aren't stopped before or at the beginning of their crimes. That's where my problem with this book lies: It's a theory. It could be that I have become so used to investigative journalism and I expected this book to behave in the same manner. I just came off The Fact of a Body: A Murder and a Memoir and The Feather Thief and I'm currently reading Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife. The difference between those books and this is that those are based in curiosity. Those authors were presented with information that spurred them into wanting to find out everything about that information and years of research and globe-trotting resulted in a book of their findings. This book, on the other hand, has a much more narrow scope; it seems to focus on backing Gladwell's theory that strangers are too complex to be understood because of our trust bias and because we don't believe in Coupling Theory. It's a thought piece, not a serious examination. And that's fine if that's what you're into. I guess I'm not because I was frustrated by the lack of depth and breadth in the research surrounding each piece of theory. I was also frustrated by the pre-set argument against argument, meaning when Gladwell said (non-verbatimly) things like, “Most Americans won’t believe in coupling theory” or “Discussions have never been this nuanced and complex when talking about issues surrounding peoples' behavior"" and calling his readers “thinking people,” it sets the stage for counter-arguments to fall under ""See, you're one of those people who refuse to understand how coupling plays a part in things"" or ""You don't understand the nuance and complexity of this discussion"" or ""You're not a thinking person, you're just reacting."" If you agree with his statements in the first place, you don't notice these little paddings here and there but the more you start to fall away from agreement, the louder and louder they seem to sound.I felt his positions churned out black and white results. There's a lack of gradation when he says that the reason we don't understand people is because we are biased toward believing others are telling the truth and because we don't believe in coupling theory, as if should we only learn how to be more pragmatic and understand that certain environmental factors are often the main cause of an event, such as town gas = suicide and crime-ridden neighborhoods = gun violence, then we'll be more proficient at not having abused children, not having treason committed right in front of our eyes, or not getting raped because we'll see the truth of the matter more often. But that's not even what he's saying! That's not the take-away here. Instead, he wraps up with (non-verbatimly) ""Keep trusting people because if you don't, you'll be another Officer Encinia and, also, remember the coupling."" Also not examined were: systemic oppressions like racism and patriarchy; the protection power affords a person; social conditioning. Like, maybe humans aren't automatically equipped with a default to trust, maybe we've been conditioned from birth to trust certain people and distrust others. Maybe if we stopped telling kids that teachers, police officers, pretty women, white men in expensive suits, and the like are good people who will always help you, we wouldn't grow up defaulting to trust. But that wasn't part of the theory so it wasn't examined.And yet, I didn't one-star this because it was interesting and Gladwell is good at narrating his thoughts. Though, on that note, he calls the audiobook ""enhanced."" This incredible new method of sharing information sounds more like a podcast because it has additional audio recordings from archives or from interviews and there's music - he chose ""Hell You Talmbout"" as the book's theme song, I'm assuming because Sandra Bland is one of the names we must say? Possibly because it loosely ties into ""All these people are dead because we don't understand strangers"" but that would be a stretch - between the chapters as well as chimes and shit going while he speaks. I suspect Gladwell doesn't listen to many audiobooks because this is not a new way to produce a sound recording, it's a thing that happens often across genres and among a variety of authors. It's a lot like a full-cast production, which the BBC has been doing for yeeeaaars. My summarized readerly thoughts: I didn't feel the title of this book accurately represented the content, there were a lot of hard-to-listen-to examples presented, and the scope of research was narrow, focused on supporting a behavioral theory by a person who is not a behavioral scientist but is, rather, someone who likes to think about things and then explain those thoughts on things to others. But it was well-narrated and had some interesting bits so it was ok."
41,0316478520,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9750143-bookofcinz,4," Like Cortes, we need translators to make sense of the world. Talking to Strangers is about why we are so bad at that act of translation   Talking to Strangers: What We Should Know about the People We Don't Know  at the core set out to show why we are so bad at communicating with strangers and what gets in the way. Gladwell, through a series of stories showed how talking to strangers can go really far left. Is this my favourite Gladwell book? No. I felt the book meandered a lot. I felt a lot was thrown at me but there was no real grounding point of the book. Yes, the book started and ended with Sandra Bland but the in-between I kept wondering well.., ""how does one make sure we are good at talking to strangers?"" - I don't feel that was sufficiently answered. No solution was offered really. I felt Gladwell was showing off a bit in this book- I mean why not- he is hella knowledgeable and well read but.... Did I learn anything new? OF COURSE! I now have a longer reading list. I cannot shut up about all I have leaned specifically about Cuba and the CIA, the truth default, the mismatch etc... all were really great!Do I recommend this book- HIGHLY RECOMMEND! Overall a great read, I just felt that the book needed tightening up or better direction. "
42,0316478520,http://goodreads.com/user/show/55625032-sheaintgotnoshoes,5,"Thanks so much for choosing me as winner in the giveaway !I loved this book !! I always thought about the disparity of meeting someone who seemed 'so nice' and someone you wanted to develop a friendship or relationship with, only to have an opposite view shortly after. Did I misjudge ? Am I too picky, critical and judgmental ? Are they really a sociopath ?This book explains a lot of that thru mismatching, which is basically how someone appears at a given time as opposed to who they really are. Another theory in misjudging strangers is the fact that some people appear to be 'not nice', 'guilty' or some other trait which many would deem as a red flag that proves false. Not everybody who is sad cries, not everyone who big hearted is a smiley face.High recommended reading !A++++++"
43,0316478520,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47417894-laura-noggle,4,"Not quite what I was expecting based on the title and Gladwell's previous books.Still, I enjoyed it, even though it felt more like cobbled together musings than a finished cohesive whole. "
44,0316478520,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59371159-ilana,3,"Fascinating read and great storytelling, but the theory is shaky at best. It could all be summed up by saying “Communication is really difficult”—be it with strangers or close friends, family and loved ones for that matter. Why limit it to strangers when even a close one can turn out to be a case of: “But I never imagined he/she could do a thing like that, not my own sweet child!” Gladwell takes several high profile cases most of us are familiar with, to make his point that talking to strangers is fraught with difficulties (no big surprise there!). He covers high profile stories such as Chamberlain’s visits with Hitler in 1938 to assure himself all would be well with the world, which proved him to be a poor judge of character, to CIA double agents working for Cuba and fooling highly trained agents who were tasked with ferreting out these very activities. In the Bernie Maddox Ponzi scheme, a whistleblower tried flagging his suspicious activities long before the amounts of money lost became quite so vast. Gladwell takes several sexual assault cases to talk about miscommunication (really, that’s what’s going on?!?) but one of the defining features of the book is he frames his argument by beginning and closing with chapters on the wrongful arrest and imprisonment of Sandra Bland in an all too frequent case of police brutality gone terrifyingly wrong because according to certain white people armed with a badge and a gun, darker skin alone makes people dangerous. He takes other cases, like author and poet Sylvia Plath’s suicide and how crime was dealt with in Kansas City to advance further theories. The first being (drum roll) that we default to truth and make wrong judgments when a person’s actions and expressions don’t match who they are, so are easily taken in by a criminal who knows who to appear innocent and blame innocent people who may simply be nervous or upset or naturally react unexpectedly, as in the Amanda Knox case. To say the Sandra Bland suicide following a seriously fucked up arrest and groundless imprisonment has more to do with miscommunication between strangers than with serious problems within the police force and how they recruit and train their officers is completely ridiculous. Just as ridiculous as saying you’re going to prevent every single suicidal person from offing themselves if you “uncouple” them from their exit method of choice and that Sylvia Plath would have lived to a ripe old age if they had switched over to natural gas sooner in England so she couldn’t have conveniently put her head in the oven in the comfort of her home without making a mess (he literally says that). Gladwell has just finished telling us she’d made several attempts before, so why does he assume she wouldn’t have tried other methods? Because he has a hypothesis to push of course. I have a pet peeve about making gross generalizations based on preconceived notions , or in this case, a theory invented to sell books. Sexual abuse cases are emotionally charged issues for me, but I will say that he was not completely off the mark when saying adults aren’t willing to believe that someone in authority or that they are familiar with can commit outrageous acts such as paedophelia and that they automatically assume the perpetrator must in fact be innocent and the victim a liar. It is also true in my experience and from observation that when it comes to the notion of consent between young people (and not so young people too), that the words: “do you consent to having intercourse”, or equivalent, are rarely, if ever spoken out loud (HELLO?!? Mood killer, anyone?!) and that this can and does indeed lead to very serious misunderstandings. However, to take the example of Brock Turner at Stanford to demonstrate an example of miscommunication between strangers had my hackles all the way up. Only men who don’t respect women to begin with will rape them when drunk. Otherwise we should excuse Anthony Kavanaugh too, maybe?!? That will NOT do. On the other hand, I found the bit by the expert on blackouts caused by alcohol quite fascinating and actually learned something. I wish he’d left the Friends TV series out of it altogether. But of course it was a hit show still beloved by countless fans and Gladwell only writes bestsellers so it had to be that show to make his point. A show I couldn’t stand precisely because they made everything so bloody obvious and transparent, with every single facial expression overstating what the character is feeling and saying so you could understand it with the volume off—I mean, just how retarded is that exactly?—but then he raises the point that most people assume facial expressions to be universal and constant throughout history when that is notre case. I’ve read one other book by Gladwell so far, which was The Tipping Point, ages ago, and I find there are lots of nuggets of truth in what he says and he is interesting and very entertaining, but I don’t think anyone would say he’s a visionary. He’s mostly a great storyteller with really good connections and timing. And marketing. And budget. And researchers, obviously. The audiobook production was very good, with excerpts from telephone and TV interviews and also recreations of court trials with student actors. I basically couldn’t put it down because of this, even as I was by turns depressed, angered, annoyed, disgusted, outraged, and compelled to talk or shout back at Gladwell to give him a piece of my mind more than once. I wouldn’t say it was a waste of my time though, which is why three whole stars."
45,0316478520,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5966084-elisabeth-young,1,"How we talk about things matter. This only results in the perpetuation of the most well accepted public narrative of college alcohol consumption being the problem. Fuck no, we don't need more of that tired narrative. How we talk about things matters. Gladwell misrepresents the actuality of this case, read the evidence and witness reports. He is only serving himself here because of the notoriety of the case. With him bending that and the Sandra Bland case to his theory, the whole thing really reads like rape and cop apologia."
46,0316478520,http://goodreads.com/user/show/230249-rachel-smalter-hall,1,"When I first heard that Malcolm Gladwell's new book takes high profile tragedies--Sandra Bland's suicide after a police traffic stop, Jerry Sandusky's and Larry Nassar's sexual abuse of children, Amanda Knox's murder trial in Italy, and Channel Miller's rape behind a dumpster at Stanford--and then attempts to use scientific studies to analyze how these ""misunderstandings"" between strangers occur, I was skeptical. The idea of using psuedo-science to exculpate the people who allowed these tragedies to happen seemed potentially irresponsible and problematic. But I didn't think it would be right to be vocally critical of his book unless I read it myself.After reading it in its entirety, my opinion hasn't changed. I think its biggest flaw is that it takes small but novel studies, and then applies them broadly and unevenly to draw inaccurate conclusions. In his analysis of why former USA gymnastics doctor Larry Nassar was allowed to sexually abuse hundreds of children for more than a decade after the first complaints against him were made, he draws on what he calls the ""default to truth"" theory--according to Gladwell, everyone believed Larry Nassar when he said he hadn't abused children because we are conditioned to believe that what people tell us is true until there is a ""catalyzing event."" But where was the ""default to truth"" for the victims? Why didn't anyone believe that the little girls were telling the truth?Gladwell completely ignores the power dynamics in every single case he looks at. At one point he even scoffs that people want to believe there's a conspiracy to cover up the truth when the simple explanation is that we're actually just conditioned to believe people. He argues that this is why Nassar was able to continue victimizing children. This conclusion is so naive that I don't even know where to start. All institutions with power have a vested interest in preserving that power, and will maintain it at all costs. Institutions like USA Gymnastics and Penn State didn't stop sexual abuse *not* because ""innocent bystanders"" like Joe Paterno ""defaulted to truth,"" but because doing a thorough investigation could have put the institution in a vulnerable position and undermined its power.Gladwell completely ignores sexism when he analyzes how Amanda Knox was portrayed in the media. He ignores racism when he analyzes how Sandra Bland was assaulted during a traffic stop. And his analysis of Chanel Miller / Emily Doe's rape draws on tired victim-blaming tropes, dressed up as new science about alcohol and myopia. And he does all of this at the expense of victims, furthering narratives that are extremely harmful to survivors."
47,0316478520,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24882791-india-m-clamp,3,"Being a definite “non-devotee” of Gladwell would be a fallacy, as in reading his Blink, Outliers and even “The Tipping Point” imparted notable “aha” moments. Judging others---evidently---is not a skill we commonly possess. Here, I defer to Steven Pinker and his abstract analysis, IQ tests and precise information.Initially hopeful reading “Talking to Strangers: What We Should Know About the People We Don’t Know” as it was nominated as the Goodreads choice award for non-fiction. Perhaps the incessant droning of stories (lacking a hypothesis, study or logic) induced my temporal narcolepsy. Reading the Amanda Knox case matter and admissions of our culpability was spot on for the most part.""Regarding the Amanda Knox...about a woman who was accused and convicted of a murder she did not commit. Years later the conviction would be overturned…issue was that people believed her casual behavior was a clear and definitive sign that she was guilty…we tend to judge people’s honesty based on their demeanor.”---Malcolm GladwellTrust and gullibility; if we gloved them up and put them together in a boxing ring, the latter would certainly be the winner of the match. Suspicion and doubt can lead us easily down a windy road to criminalize strangers. If we combine this and apply to minorities, it makes for occluded lens that manifests a “TKO” from fear. Suspicion in enforcement is nothing novel---progress is evident. Tolerance on many levels I have observed overtime. Admire Gladwell and how superbly he illustrates the Sandra Bland case. Fear and its offspring are usually nefarious and, in this state, would anyone's behavior be rational I ponder. Pert case stories and entertaining recount of Sylvia Plath and Bernie Madoff. Read."
48,0316478520,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7494844-laurel-suspected-bibliophile,3,RTC!Read the audiobook! Gladwell's voice is ~dreamy~
49,0316478520,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17408049-lynne,4,I really learned a lot from this book. The audio version was outstanding. Just wish there were more directions on how to talk to strangers. 
50,0316478520,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1331641-jacob-proffitt,4,"Leave it to Gladwell to take on a highly-charged topic and thread his way through to a nuanced and (I believe) convincing endpoint and explanation. The riots in Ferguson and related incidents have been attributed, on both sides of the political spectrum, to racial tension. One side claiming systemic racism and the other dismissing abuses as individuals behaving badly and accusing others of racializing it for their own reasons. Gladwell lays down the case that at its heart this isn't really about race at all. And like I said, it takes someone like Gladwell to do this without dismissing either side.And I don't want to give the wrong impression. Gladwell's compassion and concern for all participants in these events comes through. He doesn't shortchange any side and people looking to confirm their preconceived notions are going to be very disappointed. Because while he shows that it isn't about systemic racism, it really, very much is a systemic problem and not merely individuals behaving badly. And the corollary to that is equally strong, that those who perceive a systemic wrong are justified in their anger and despair.And to build that case he has to show the moving pieces with enough detail that you can see how some very complex parts of human behavior have come together to create distrust and violence. And I'll leave it to him to do so because I can't possibly give it the weight it deserves in this review. I will say that by the end, some things I had noticed became clear. There has been a sea-change in policing in recent years and I noticed some of that, myself.(Begin personal overshare. Feel free to skip this paragraph) I don't have a ton of interactions with the police, but I have nearly zero respect for speed limit laws and generally go as fast as I feel I can get away with. And because I'm not an idiot, that means for the past 25 years or so, I end up with a speeding ticket about every four years for whatever reason. But in the last five years, I've been pulled over much more frequently and been given a warning. And I've noticed that the pretext for those stops were flimsy to begin with and very much subjective at their heart. And I've noticed that the interactions in those stops has felt very different, with an antagonism and suspicion that puzzled (and frankly angered) me. And I'm sure my demeanor was a mirror of that feeling (possibly because I'm a white guy, but certainly because I have lawyer and cop friends and if some trumped-up thug in uniform wants to make an issue for me, I know I am not without resources and recourse). But what Gladwell does is show why and how those interactions have changed. And why there is both a qualitative and a quantitative shift in those interactions. And while there may be no racist intent, there can certainly be a disparate racial effect of this change.You'll have to read the book to see the details. And it really does have to do with how we approach strangers, both as individuals and as institutions. And while I have some qualms or nits to pick with some of the sections he uses to build his case I find that in the end he is very convincing. And the most convincing thing he does is show how there are no bad actors in this terrible dynamic—people really are trying their best to do hard work under trying circumstances. They've just read things wrong because it turns out that talking to strangers is very hard to get right.In the end, I kind of wish he had taken on some of the more sordid elements that also feed into the problem. I'm not sure it helps to leave those out entirely (like, for example, the financial aspect of this shift in policing that pours money into the coffers of both the police who make the change and the communities that allow it). Or that the shift also provides scope for those who want to behave badly and have official cover for those actions. Not taking those elements on leaves his conclusions open to dispute by those of us who have a more cynical view of human nature.So I'm giving this four stars for a great explanation and increase in understanding. I highly recommend reading this for some fascinating insights in human interactions and why we get so much wrong when we are trying our hardest to get it right. And I will reiterate that I find his conclusion compelling and informative and really hope it gets broad-enough exposure to bring about a much-needed systemic correction.A note about the Audiobook: Gladwell bills the audiobook as ""enhanced"" because he took some pains to seek out original sources and includes people in their own words wherever possible. And he provides dramatic representations where the original audio doesn't exist (like, for example, in court transcripts). I found this interesting and I think it's a good addition to an audiobook that includes a lot of such footage like this one does. But I don't think it necessarily makes the audiobook a preferred format. Reading quotes and clips and excerpts in other works (particularly non-fiction) already has the effect of changing the narrative voice for most readers, I suspect. So while I appreciate the care in the audio version, I wouldn't recommend the audio over pure text just to get that enhancement."

When someone begins a claim with ""I'm not victim-blaming,"" and then says something that is clearly victim-blaming, they're still victim-blaming. You can't pull an UNO reverse card on what's coming out of your mouth just by saying ""I'm not racist/sexist/homophobic/transphobic, but..."". It doesn't work like that. Similarly, if you choose an extremely important, complicated, and emotionally impactful issue, and then magnify the least important aspect of that issue, you're not issuing a ""hot take."" You're missing the point.I have read and greatly enjoyed Gladwell before. Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking and Outliers: The Story of Success are still both great books, and I've enjoyed all four seasons of his podcast as well. Everything he's produced up to this has been a great example of how important ""explainers"" are to public understanding of science and social issues. Everything else he's produced has also been far more logical and coherent than this...whatever this is. Gladwell's point is, simply, we don't know strangers. We make subconscious decisions about their facial expressions, body language, speech, writing, etc, that do not accurately reflect their intentions, their character, or what they are actually trying to convey, and these subconscious decisions can snowball into much greater errors of judgment. It is, more or less, a feeble extension of Blink, but executed by poorly stringing numerous infamous incidents together and claiming they all have something in common. Sandra Bland's death in the custody of Texas police, the Penn State child sexual abuse scandal, the Stanford sexual assault case, and even more that I don't care to recount. You could make the (pointless) argument that any one of these cases is a result of snowballing errors of judgment. But Gladwell is missing the forest for the trees. Almost all the cases he recounts in this book happened to people as a result of systemic injustice. Sandra Bland--a black woman, facing a white police officer who had never been challenged on his institution's systematic mistreatment of black women. Chanel Miller--a young Chinese-American woman, assaulted by a white man who had never before been challenged on his treatment of women. The Jerry Sandusky victims--vulnerable children, often from broken homes, facing a revered icon of manhood who held immense financial and political sway within Penn State University and its football community. Gladwell is making the same error as the bail judges in his book--he is breaking down these cases into irrelevant information that is drawing him to irrelevant, inaccurate conclusions. Is it really conducive to a greater understanding of child exploitation to excuse Penn State officials from fault because they never heard the word ""sodomized"" used to describe Jerry Sandusky's activities with children? Is it really conducive to a greater understanding of rape culture to say that someone (a rapist) becomes a completely different person when drunk, and that their drunk actions (rape) are not a reflection of their true character (the character of a rapist)? I don't understand what Gladwell's goal is here, and it's incredibly frustrating. I have the uneasy feeling that the Venn Diagram of people who will enjoy this book and people who will demand that Joker be nominated for an Oscar is eerily close to a circle."

Gladwell is an excellent reader of his own work, and he takes it up a notch here by translating his book into a full audio production with music, news clips, and voice reenactments. Fans of his podcast, Revisionist History, or other radio shows like This America Life, will appreciate the level of production and what it brings to the storytelling. On that point, I give this audiobook 5 stars. However, in regard to content, I give it 1 star. This book was confusing and difficult for me. Confusing because I never really felt like Gladwell tied up his concepts in a stepwise, logical way. His past books string together seemingly disparate ideas to support his central thesis, but this one felt really scattered to me. Yes, we find it difficult to talk to strangers, but what can we do with that as a society in a meaningful way? This question was left unanswered. I don't expect him to resolve this very difficult, complex question by himself, but it was very unsatisfying, even to the point where I feel fairly bleak about the entire idea. On the difficulty side, this book needs to come with a multitude of trigger warnings: police brutality, sexual assault, suicide, torture, and profanity. Suicide is almost a nonstarter for me, and there were points at which I considered not finishing the book. The other triggers, especially the (overly detailed, in my opinion) coverage of the Jerry Sandusky, Larry Nassar, and Brock Turner assault cases, require caution. Upon reflection, I wondered if I reacted so negatively to these examples because some of what I remember most clearly from Gladwell's past books are droll cocktail-party-type anecdotes: the broken windows theory, the impact of birthday on hockey player success, and so on. I was caught off guard by the severity and seriousness of the palette of examples. I don't blame Gladwell for using these examples; they are effective and illustrative. But I want to make the trigger warnings perfectly clear for other potential readers. In my reading experience (and I have read all of Gladwell's books), this latest is remarkably different in content than his other writing. I will reflect on it more as I give the content space in my brain. I will be curious to discuss it with others as more people read it, especially those who are familiar with Gladwell's work. If you choose to read it, do so with awareness of the heavy subject content and triggers mentioned above."
53,0316478520,http://goodreads.com/user/show/557247-jon,2,"So infuriating. A quarter of the way into this book, I would have given it four or even five stars. The promise of a deeper investigation into the Sandra Bland case was intriguing; the research about bias toward truth and just how bad people are at judging strangers' emotions and responses made for interesting reading. It offered an engaging and challenging array of studies and stories.Then it all starts going horribly wrong. Gladwell's stated goals at the beginning of the book sound noble, but he winds up dragging readers through an increasingly disjointed collection of anecdotes. The arguments become less credible, and the implications become a lot more disturbing. None of this is helped by the fact that Gladwell--who goes to great lengths early on to tell us all how bad...Bad...BAD we are at interpreting strangers and their complex reactions--seems awfully willing to take the testimony of people like Brock Turner and Brian Encinia at face value. We should feel sorry for them, Gladwell insists, because... well... they SAY we should.There was a good idea in here somewhere, but it got very lost along the way. It's certainly true that the death of Sandra Bland involved more than a single, racist police officer. But it's befuddling that Gladwell could write an entire book to ""explain"" the encounter between Bland and Encinia through the problems we have interpreting strangers while NEVER seriously considering the ways in which race and power effect those interpretations. The result is an unconvincing mess.This was my first book by Gladwell. It may also be my last."

We assume that people tell the truth, so we can’t detect lies. And we believe that we can judge strangers based on little, usually deceptive, information. The result of this misplaced confidence is that we don’t invest enough time and patience in truly listening to and understanding each other.When British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain traveled to Munich to meet with Adolf Hitler in 1938, he wanted to get the measure of the man. Initially fearful of another world war, Chamberlain left Germany confident and satisfied that he fully understood what the German Führer had in mind. Hitler, he believed, was a man who could be trusted. History, though, proved Chamberlain catastrophically wrong. (blinkist summary)"

In Talking to Strangers, Gladwell investigates what goes wrong when we interact with people we don’t know, using dramatic scenarios ripped from the headlines, history, psychology, and criminology. Gladwell begins and ends with the tragic death of Sandra Bland, and it’s impossible to ignore how urgently we need better strategies of understanding strangers."

In this book, Mr. Gladwell analyzes some ""ripped from the headlines"" cases such as the Jerry Sandusky and Bernie Madoff scandals and how they were perputrated for years before finally coming to light. His analysis is within the framework of our normal societal defaults explains why/how these rascals lasted as long as they did. Well worth the read for me.4.5 stars rounded up"

We should accept the limits of our ability to decipher strangers.”Talking To Strangers is the sixth book by British author, Malcolm Gladwell. Is it a book about social interaction? Yes, certainly, but not so much a “how to” as a “why do we get it wrong”. Gladwell explores the reasons that we seem to be so bad at telling when strangers are lying to us. He does this with reference to a myriad of psychological experiments, research, case studies and examples. Gladwell holds that we are successfully deceived by strangers through a combination of three main reasons: the fundamentally human tendency to default to believing we are being told the truth; that facial expression and demeanour are much less reliable than we believe; and context matters a great deal.“We fall out of truth-default mode only when the case against our initial assumption becomes definitive. We do not behave, in other words, like sober-minded scientists, slowly gathering evidence of the truth or falsity of something before reaching a conclusion. We do the opposite. We start by believing. And we stop believing only when our doubts and misgivings rise to the point where we can no longer explain them away.”Gladwell cites examples of Cuban spies and the CIA, Hitler and Chamberlain, Bernie Madoff and the SEC, the Penn State Paedophile Case, a murder in Perugia, and more “If every coach is assumed to be a pedophile, then no parent would let their child leave the house, and no sane person would ever volunteer to be a coach. We default to truth—even when that decision carries terrible risks—because we have no choice. Society cannot function otherwise. And in those rare instances where trust ends in betrayal, those victimized by default to truth deserve our sympathy, not our censure.”Gladwell talks about whistle blowers, bail judges, alcoholic blackout and sexual assault, the effects of torture on brain function, and ultimately relates it all back to the tragic consequences of a traffic stop in Texas. Regards reading faces and behaviours: “Each of us, over the course of our lives, builds our own set of operating instructions for our face, based on the culture and environment we inhabit. The face is a symbol of how different human beings are, not how similar we are, which is a big problem if your society has created a rule for understanding strangers based on reading faces.”He tells us “Our strategies for dealing with strangers are deeply flawed, but they are also socially necessary. We need the criminal-justice system and the hiring process and the selection of babysitters to be human. But the requirement of humanity means that we have to tolerate an enormous amount of error. That is the paradox of talking to strangers. We need to talk to them. But we’re terrible at it”And also “The thing we want to learn about a stranger is fragile. If we tread carelessly, it will crumple under our feet. And from that follows a second cautionary note: we need to accept that the search to understand a stranger has real limits. We will never know the whole truth. We have to be satisfied with something short of that. The right way to talk to strangers is with caution and humility.”Fully indexed, and with footnotes and thirty-one pages of comprehensive end notes, this is a fascinating and enlightening read.This unbiased review is from an uncorrected proof copy provided by NetGalley and Penguin UK"
