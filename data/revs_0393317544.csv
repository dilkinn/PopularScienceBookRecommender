0,0393317544,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1713956-manny,1,"I couldn't understand this book at all, but was dutifully attempting to plough through it when a visiting friend noticed it on my shelf. ""That's just the worst book ever written!"" he said. ""My mother-in-law knows him. He's an idiot."" Possibly there was an adjective before ""idiot"". At any rate, I decided I didn't need to read any more, though I'm afraid it's still on my shelf. I can't quite say why. Lack of decisiveness, I suppose."
1,0393317544,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4497443-tom,4,"Well, this took me a long time to read. Partly it was due to the ideas themselves; a lot of passages need to be re-read to really understand the point Deacon is trying to make, as a lot of what he talks about is just fundamentally hard to grasp. I think it was also partly due to Deacon himself; his prose can get pretty wordy and, in some portions, he's detailed almost to a fault.To really a review this book properly I feel like a person would need to write a lengthy essay, but I don't feel like doing that. Instead, I'll do what I've gotten in the habit of doing and just give my vague, general impressions. My review score here was overly difficult to decide upon, by the way. His general thesis of symbolic co-evolution acting on the brain as a selective force is plausible and fascinating, but speculative nonetheless. One of his other main focuses--the attempted refutation of any Language Acquisition Device (LAD) or internal grammar mechanism--is well argued and substantiated with plenty of evidence, but I'm not entirely sure if I'd now say I'm on his side or not.Just a brief overview of how the book is laid out: The first part deals with Deacon's analysis of language as a symbolic medium, broken down into the iconic, the indexical, and the symbolic. This section is probably the easiest part of the book, but it still requires careful reading to understand, and it's vital that one does understand this section since it's essential to comprehending the rest of the book. The second section is where he delves deep into the neuroscience and the neurobiology. Probably the most challenging section, it's here where he makes his sustained argument against the LAD. The last section is kind of all over the place, with Deacon speculating (sometimes quite freely) as to what language-brain co-evolution implies for things like the nature of consciousness, the constitution of the self, the mind-body problem, and other problems that have yet to be entirely successfully removed from philosophy and find placement in science.So, should a person read this? Yeah, I definitely think so. That is, if you're really interested in this stuff. If you only have a passing interest in brains, language, or evolution, I would give this one a pass and go for something easier. Just making it through this tome is a hearty commitment. Precisely understanding all Deacon's points probably takes at least two read-throughs, and that's hours and hours of your time. But I think, in the end, if you enjoy the subject matter, it's almost definitely worth getting the perspective even if a person isn't inclined to agree with all he has to say (especially some of the questionable and more philosophical moves he makes toward the end)."
2,0393317544,http://goodreads.com/user/show/215221-bria,5,"The subtitle is a huge hint here - language and the brain evolved together. Partly, humans have a weird brain that allows us to have symbolic language, which is largely unattainable by other species. But also partly, the language we have is suited to our peculiar brains. Deacon's understanding of evolution allows him to see through the hysteria of how we could have possibly evolved such a universal grammar module and perceive what seems, in retrospect, obvious: what human languages have in common are those things that they require in order to survive in the environment of our brains. But the real meat of this book is the meticulous, evidence-backed detail he uses to flesh out the mechanisms that support his hypotheses. He dissects language down to its bits in order to pinpoint what's so wacky about symbolic language that it's so rare - it requires a weird sort of learning that normally isn't very useful to have. He then examines how it was that this one weird species accidentally happened to learn that one weird trick to allow such a thing. Drowning us in waves of anthropological and zoological evidence of what types of cognition, language, and behavior are present in different species, he really allows the reader to understand the mechanism of this complementary evolutionary process that let us have this dumb language and consequent crazy notion of self-awareness. It's very concretely grasping quite an abstract and ephemeral topic, which is really all I ever really want out of life. And, like anything that I gain a greater understanding of, it rather made the entire process seem wildly unlikely. There are a lot more factors involved in the type of consciousness we're familiar with than I had even realized, so I'll have to go back to my Drake equation and make sure the appropriate factors are appropriately factored in."
3,0393317544,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1959624-amanda,4,"While Deacon often appears to take a self-aggrandizing attitude toward his own work and may use some questionable examples to support his theories (it is a pop science book, after all), The Symbolic Species is a great discussion starter regarding language evolution. I did walk away from this book thinking that very little of it actually offered evidence for HOW language and the brain co-evolved, but I enjoyed it nonetheless. While I am no disciple of Chomsky, Deacon does seem to gloss over the poverty of stimulus dilemma in a way that made me feel uncomfortable. Especially since Deacon becomes almost preachy in his anti-Chomskyan rhetoric. However, further outside reading did at least offer a more reasonable argument from Deacon as he employed more specific linguistic examples that you won't find in this book. (I'm a geeky grad student in linguistics, and I crave these tidbits!) If you feel somewhat frustrated by Deacon's circular writing style, try listening to this talk from 2010: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT-zZ0...Deacon provides a great summary of his theories when he wrote The Symbolic Species and offers new insights from his current research. Watching this video actually made him seem like a very amiable professor that I wouldn't mind visiting during office hours. I am wary of taking this book as dogmatic truth, but it's certainly a refreshing and provocative perspective on how symbolic thought makes the human experience so unique. "
4,0393317544,http://goodreads.com/user/show/688965-sean,4,"A brain-melter of a book. Fascinating and brilliant and dense. Written clearly but at great length and depth. Suggests language shaped the human brain as much as the brain shaped language, and shows just how that was accomplished, and why there's no such thing as 'simple' languages in other animals. It's all about the hurdle of symbolic thought and communication. My brain feels like it was re-shaped just to take it all in. "
5,0393317544,http://goodreads.com/user/show/964406-nick,5,"In answer to central questions such as ""What makes humans different?"", ""Is it brain size that gives humans speech?"", ""How did consciousness and language evolve in humans?"", and ""What is consciousness?"", Deacon provides an elegant solution. We are a symbolic species. Language, and as a consequence consciousness, are made possible by the use of an ability to process symbols. I will try to explain how the symbolic process works, why it is important, how it evolved, and what effect it has on consciousness following Deacon's arguments.Let us make a few important points to start with. The approach here is truly inspirational and revolutionary. This is not a repetition of tired and discredited views of 'language areas of the brain' or the left-right split for thought and language. This book does not spend 450+ pages supporting the tired hackneyed conjecturing of Chomsky, Pinker & their followers. Ever since Chomsky first announced some kind of language acquisition device, more and more physical evidence has been amassed about how the brain functions and is structured to show how misguided the original idea was. Instead of retreating, the Chomsky camp has only tried to obscure this basic belief behind formalisms and frauds. Deacon puts the problem clearly. It is nonsense to talk about brains being specifically designed to cater to language from birth, as if language is fixed and brains change to suit language. Whatever language is, it must have evolved to cater to the proclivities of human brain structures and patterns. Language has evolved to the human brain, not the other way.The core principle of Deacon's approach is a neo-Piercean symbolism. While a real-life object may have a referent, the referent can quickly become an icon that stands separately from the object itself. In the animal world, alarm calls have a direct relationship between a threat and the sound made by a group of animals. These references rarely become iconic in the way that a pet dog may be able to associate any kind of round object with the sound of 'ball' and behave accordingly. None of these, however, represent the way that humans use language. The extra step that animals do not seem to make is to then re-associate icons with each other in novel combinations to the extent that meaning is derived more from the relationships between icons than between the icon and the original object. That this ability is not beyond animals, in particular bonobos, has been demonstrated by the great work carried out by Sue Savage-Rumbaugh and colleagues at the Great Ape Trust, referred to by Deacon. The question that we must answer is why humans have come to depend so heavily on symbols. Or, more precisely, what evolutionary advantage did symbolic thinking offer early humans? To answer this question Deacon suggests that to look for the source of humans' unique linguistic abilities we should look at their unique evolutionary adaptations. Fundamentally, human societies are all WRONG for two reasons. The first is that human growth patterns work against survival. At precisely the time that mothers and infants need the most food they are at their most incompetent at foraging and feeding. The only way that the mother and child can be assured of having enough food is to share with others, either with other potential mothers or with the father. Potential mothers must make the symbolic connection between exchanging food in their hand for a promise of assistance when they are in need. Thus reciprocity, a human cultural universal, is a symbolic act - it is an exchange of material goods for a promise. Even animals capable of symbolic reasoning find this a difficult leap to make. A father will only share food if he is certain that the child is carrying their genes - and this leads us to the 2nd reason why human societies should not really work when compared to other animals' responses to the reproduction of an individual's genes. Typically animals will either pair-bond or congregate in exclusive mating groups. That is pair-bonds will have a way of showing other potential mates that they are no longer available for reproduction and may even withdraw from potential contact with other suitors to ensure the continuation of their genes. Outside crowded colonies, this is a typical response for many bird species. The other response is typified by the lion pride. A small number of (often related) males will mate with a 'harem' of females who are then given the responsibility of child-rearing and feeding. Thus, when a new lion takes over the pride he will normally kill all the infant lions so that the lionesses are not spending effort on raising another lion's cubs. The same dilemma of 'wasting' valuable resources on another man's genes faces humans, but the response of human social groupings is 'perverse.' Human groups typically consist of a variety of potential male and female mates. In order to ensure a pair-bond humans must again use a symbolic process to pair-bond: they must promise themselves to each other. Thus another human cultural universal becomes ritualised in the myriad forms of marriage ceremony that exist to announce to the community that a pair bond has been established.So if Deacon can tie the genesis of language down to the end of Australopithecus and the start of homo habilus, what has happened to language since? Whatever language was at the start, it is no longer. We cannot expect our current linguistic abilities to have appeared in total at once. Deacon suggests that a lot of original language was multi-modal, involving body movements, pitch and volume. All of these aspects of communication are still present, but are often ignored by linguists obsessed with predicate logic. We cannot communicate without moving parts of our bodies and Deacon points out that while the 'words' that we concentrate so hard on are being transferred by speech, prosodic features of language are working hard to provide emotional cues. He then describes how the brain probably works in parallel across the two hemispheres to chunk incoming linguistic information so that while one half works on the segmented sounds that constitute lexis and grammar the other tries to unravel the cues provided by prosody. That is, neither hemisphere is exclusively related to language but the two hemispheres simultaneously process different types of linguistic information - and this can be learned by either side of the brain.This is a superb book. It is almost impossible to do it justice in any length of review. In fact it is 3 superb books - one on linguistics, one on neurology and one on evolution. No make that 4 - it is also fundamentally an anthropological book. While this is its great strength, it is also what makes it a difficult read for most people. Few others could write this book, and most readers will have background knowledge in one or maybe two of these areas. Alongside Deacon's more typical anthropological interests in culture and language (and more than a passing interest in evolutionary theory), his expertise stretches to neurology and experimental biological anthropology. One might call him a renaissance man, but that probably betrays how narrowly-focused many disciplines and specialities have become as much as it celebrates the breadth of Deacon's knowledge."
6,0393317544,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9362019-pratyush-rathore,3,"This is a very badly written book with excellent ideas - Nassim Nicholas Taleb's ideas with Ayn Rand's writing skills.It can take almost infinite time to read, I haven't finished it yet, it is not even enjoyable most of the times. But then, every 50-80 pages or so, an idea would strike me hard and I would just close the book and think about what I have understood, perhaps reread the previous portions to make sense of what I understood. In a sense, that the book is badly written is an advantage to the reader since you are forced to think the ideas through, rather than taking the author by face value, but really, the writing skills are somewhere between ghastly and gruesome. The quality of ideas are somewhere between beautiful and shocking."
7,0393317544,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2707197-robin,5,"Deacon's book is over a decade old but holds up well. His analysis of the forces that led to the characteristic brain structure of humans is not unique, although this was one of the first publications to pull the evidence together in a coherent account over time. His primary contribution is the careful argument for the *co*-evolution of brain structures with language, and for the way in which symbolic thinking and ritual preceeded and fostered language capability. Deacon's insights have found strong support in the cognitive linguistics movement and especially among the embodied cognition research thrust."
8,0393317544,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1905506-stephen,4,"This is a great book that can get a little dense and technical at times. The main premise of the text is that what really separates humans from animals and other forms of life is language. Humans use language symbolically as opposed to indexically. The explanation for what this means was one of the hardest parts of the book to get. What it boils down to is that animals, particularly smart animals like chimps and dogs, can map words to specific meanings but they cannot do things like string words together to form long sentences or use the same symbol (word) for multiple meanings. Chimpanzees even struggle with this even though they can learn an impressive vocabulary of word to symbol mappings. Another important fact is that languages simply do not exist in nature outside of humans.The author then proceeds to examine why or how humans can do this complicated trick. Simple net intelligence is examined and found to be not sufficient. He brings up the fact that mice have similar brain to mass ratios to humans and mice are not considered exceptionally smart. He also points out that Chihuahuas have a much higher brain to body mass ratio than other dogs, even close to humans, but they are not even considered smart for dogs. The reason must have something to do with brain size and structure (not just size). He goes on to show that several regions of our brain are quite a bit larger than expected if we simply scaled up a chimp brain to human size. Some how the pre-frontal region of the brain was exceptionally expanded. How do things like this happen in nature? Evolution. And why would evolution select for this language ability? The author supposes it has to do with our social organization (pair bonding within a large group) which also turns out to be unique in nature. Humans needed language to determine who was sexually available and who was not. They also needed communication between the pairs so that the male who helps with provisioning of the children can be ensured he is in fact provisioning his own child (genetically).The final chapters are devoted to how the brain actually learns. Pretty cool stuff. For a fairly large and challenging book, I found it a fairly easy read."
9,0393317544,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14729227-jonathan-tweet,4,"Some really good bits about brain development, brain evolution in mammals and humans, language and symbol use among trained animals, and ritual as the incubator for speech. Unfortunately, it's hard going, and you have to really care (and maybe skim parts) to get through it. Also, when an anthropologists says that a capacity did not evolve and could not have evolved, you have to take those conclusions with a grain of salt. "
10,0393317544,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6902786-megan,2,"Fascinating topic. The text was hard to get through. It didn't read like a book written for a wider audience and the author had a tendency to wax philosophical and meander on tangents around the point. I thoroughly enjoyed the tangents, but I feel they could have been organized more thoughtfully. It felt like the written equivalent of listening to a professor who likes to hear himself talk."

12,0393317544,http://goodreads.com/user/show/188511-krishan,5,A fascinating and challenging book about human uniqueness. I can't believe I read the whole thing. Proper review to follow.

14,0393317544,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61557581-behrooz-parhami,5,"This impressive book by an imminently qualified brain specialist, who also displays a firm grasp of language acquisition mechanisms and associated disorders, is structured in three parts, each having 4-6 chapters (see the table of contents at the end of this review). At 525 pages, each packed with information, it isn’t an easy read but persevering pays out handsomely at the end. One appealing feature of the book is its many helpful diagrams and charts.Deacon begins Chapter 1 with this wonderful quote from Soren Kierkergaard: “[T]he paradox is the source of the thinker’s passion, and the thinker without a paradox is like a lover without feeling: a paltry mediocrity.” Deacon’s thesis is that a sort of grammar mechanism is hardwired into the human brain, which accounts for the facility with which we learn language. Other species, by contrast, have a very hard time doing so. Many species do develop sophisticated communication systems, but the symbolic nature of human languages, with its immense representational power, is missing from all such schemes. The figure below shows three oft-cited examples of animal communication systems possessing elements that can be likened to a vocabulary. But these systems lack the generality of human language, which requires “symbolic competence” for understanding.Figure: http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbi...Having stated his thesis clearly and forcefully, Deacon sets out to methodically describe and argue for the supporting evidence. One key observation is that we should avoid the illusion of progress toward understanding human language acquisition mechanism that results from using more and more precise terminology for what we don’t know, rather than actually discovering what is missing. “Linguists have progressively redefined what supposedly cannot be learned in ever more formal and precise terms, and so we may have the feeling that these accounts are approaching closer and closer to an explanation.” I have been bothered by a similar phenomenon in astrophysics, where gaps in our knowledge are filled with ill-defined notions such as dark matter, which is, in effect, a way of increasing the mass available in the universe in order to balance our equations, without adding understanding as to why the discrepancy exists to begin with.In the course of human evolution, language and thinking have become virtually inseparable. “The way that language represents objects, events, and relationships provides a uniquely powerful economy of reference. It offers a means for generating an essentially infinite variety of novel representations, and an unprecedented inferential engine for predicting events, organizing memories, and planning behaviors. It entirely shapes our thinking and the ways we know the physical world. It is so pervasive and inseparable from human intelligence in general that it is difficult to distinguish what aspects of the human intellect have not been molded and streamlined by it.”The reproductive advantages of better language skills are rather obvious, explaining the evolutionary path for human language. Language skills help cooperative behaviors, such as the ability to pass on information about distant food supplies or organizing labor for a hunt. They also lead to more successful social manipulation and deception, such as misleading one’s competitors. In fact, it is quite difficult to imagine any human endeavor that would not benefit from better communication.Despite catchy chapter titles and mostly informal style of writing, this is no popularized science book. Many passages are taxing and require concentration. Nonetheless, the book has my highest recommendation for those who seek to understand human communication and the mechanisms that have evolved over millions of years to support it.I end this review by listing the book’s table of contents.[Part One: Language] 1. The Human Paradox. 2. A Loss for Words. 3. Symbols Aren’t Simple. 4. Outside the Brain[Part Two: Brain] 5. The Size of Intelligence. 6. Growing Apart. 7. A Darwinian Electrician. 8.

Like you know when you just fly through a book and you almost forget you're reading, that didn't happen. If I wasn't reading it for a stressful paper while being overwhelmed I would have enjoyed it much more. I think, it isn't my normal genre, but I'm trying to broaden my horizons. Fascinating and really makes you introspect, also changed my mind on some things that I thought were fact but turned out to be speculation/not absolutely true, like how brain to body ration affects intelligence. "
16,0393317544,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28825839-stephie-williams,3,"Terrence W. Deacon presents a reasonable, but not conclusive case for the co-evolution of the brain and language. The way he describes it, they kind of feedback on each other. He is against the Chomskian theory of there being a dedicated innate brain structure for a universal grammer wich all languages are thought to share in this theory. Having agrued against Chomsky and others, he does not deny that children have a special ability to learn language. He believes that languages use children to evolve as languages help the brain evolve.This co-evolution of brain and language is posited by Deacon to occur through the Baldwin effect. The Baldwin effect is that behavior that is produced during the lifetime of an organism affects the niche of that organism. Than any changes in genes through mutation and natural selection that helps the organism to survive in this altered niche is than passed on to the next generation. Deacon thinks that this is what happened with the brain and language. Homonids figured out how to use symbols in communiction which affected their cultural niche, and subsequently the genes took over, so that the brain now evolved it's language abilities. The process continues back and forth—behavior and genes. Although I have heard of the Baldwin effect, I do not know if it is accepted by mainstream evolutionists. Not that this is necessary for a theory to be true in some cases. It sounds plausable, like Deacon's whole scheme.Another scheme Deacon introduced, at least to me, was how symbolic communication developed out of the indexical, which in turn developed out of the iconic. The iconic is more or less immediated, while the indexical is the association of the iconic, and finally the symbolic stands in for the indexical so to speak. When later in the book he discusses consciousness, he believes that human style consciousness requires symbolic level communication, while all animals have a consciousness link to both the iconic and indexical levels. As I mentioned, I think that Deacon's arguments are reasonable, but not ironclad, which is not suprising giving how we are dealing with topics that are hard to pin down, not like physics or chemistry. Biology, especially biology which deals with human behavior is just messy in my opinion. Still I believe he has made a valuable contribution to the subject matter he delves into. Finally, I found the book's middle section on the brain, to be on the boring side. It was mainly just this structure and that, and how it contributes to different compentences. Overall, because of his unique view, as far as I know, I give the book good marks. I would recommend it to anybody interested in langauge and the brain. The overall level is not to difficult to understand, although the novice might be taxed. "
