0,0805071342,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57901-jerzy,4,"First, my old review from reading it back in 2007 before my MS in Statistics. Below that, my newer review from re-reading it in 2013 before my PhD.~~~2007~~~I loved the overviews of fascinating philosophical problems surrounding the use of statistics. (For example, hypothesis testing is used pretty much everywhere but even the mathematicians who came up with it had doubts about its validity and usefulness in most situations... What does a 95% confidence interval REALLY mean, in terms of real life, when you come right down to it?)The author also paints a great picture of how rich and varied the field of statistics is, and what interesting people have contributed to it. As someone who wishes I were a real mathematician, it's a little depressing for me to read about a genius like Kolmogorov who came up with interesting results in every field he touched ever since childhood... But it's also heartening to hear about the many non-""genius"" people who, unable to find an existing technique to evaluate their data, ended up creating original, useful statistical tools that became widely used and spawned whole new fields of mathematical research.I wish the author had used at least a few equations or graphs - it's hard to explain complicated math in natural English - but it's still a great and informative read.~~~2013~~~I'm getting a lot more out of it on the 2nd reading, now that I know a lot of the theory he describes in handwavy terms for lay readers.This book is definitely a history of statistics through anecdotes: the author's stories about the time he heard Savage lecture or was a discussant for Neyman, his colleagues' memories of Fisher and Pearson, etc.It's especially fascinating if you already recognize these names from their papers and are curious about their personalities, what inspired their work and how it fit into their historical context, etc. But you won't learn the technical details here.If you want something from a more formal historian of statistics, Stigler seems to be the guy: The History of Statistics: The Measurement of Uncertainty Before 1900 and Statistics on the Table: The History of Statistical Concepts and Methods.One book I wish someone would write is the history of statistics education and stats textbooks. If Bayes hid his famous theorem, Fisher discouraged unthinking use of alpha=0.05, Neyman disavowed the hypothesis tests he created, etc. ... then how did these things come to be standard methods applied mechanically by scientists everywhere?Specific points:* p.4-5: Before Fisher's The Design of Experiments, ""experiments were idiosyncratic to each scientist."" Although Fisher obviously didn't invent experimentation, he put it on a consistent and rigorous footing. And researchers only published their conclusions with a small supportive subset of the data, not the whole experiment. (Gregor Mendel dropped inconvenient data from his famous pea experiments!) Even today we often see researchers hesitant to share not only their data but their code, despite the reproducible research movement.* p.7: ""any useful experiment has to be one that allows for estimation of those outcomes,"" i.e. Fisher realized that your parameters will always be estimated imperfectly, but if you design your experiment and choose your estimator carefully, the estimates can be precise enough to be useful.* p.10: Pearson's The Grammar of Science is apparently still worth reading today. (I also recall that it inspired young Neyman.)* A brief academic family tree of early statisticians working in the UK: Francis Galton came up with correlation and regression to the mean. He then (taught? managed? influenced?) Karl Pearson, who promoted the idea that distributions are the thing of interest to science, and developed his family of skew distributions. Karl Pearson influenced many in the next generation, including Fisher, Gosset, Neyman, and Pearson's own son Egon. From there on, the field of statistics exploded.* p.17: Pearson proposed that what's ""real"" (or of interest to science) is not each measurement we take, but the abstract distribution they come from. But it took Fisher to make clear the distinction between a parameter's true value, and your estimator for that parameter (the formula you feed data into), and your estimate of the parameter (the actual value you got using a particular dataset). He also clarified that even if you collect a ton of data, your estimates of that distribution will still be just estimates---and that Pearson's estimators do not have good properties (the resulting estimates won't tend to be as close to the truth as they could be), but better estimators can be derived.* p.19: Galton and K. Pearson's Biometrika was originally founded with the goal of measuring distributions of biological measurements about species around the world, showing that those distributions change over time, and thus providing proof of Darwin's theories. It was very expensive to print, containing complicated typesetting for math formulas and being the first journal to include full color photos. Its correspondents sound like Indiana Jones, traversing jungles and deserts and rain forests to measure native tribes and little-known animal species. It sounds like the primarily-mathematical articles (which it is now known for) were used mostly as filler at first.* p.28-29: I love the story of Gosset, or ""Student,"" working at Guinness and keeping his research a trade secret. Hotelling tried to meet Gosset in the 1930s and ""arrangements were made to meet him secretly, with all the aspects of a spy mystery."" We also often forget that Gosset did not derive the mathematical t-distribution (that was Fisher) but rather he ran an early and very laborious Monte Carlo experiment, shuffling stacks of cards with numbers on them and recording the averages etc. Gosset was driven by the need to work with small samples. As he told K. Pearson: ""If I am the only person that you've come across that works with too small samples, you are very singular.""(Paul Velleman gave a talk at JSM 2011 debunking some of the myths around the Gosset story; I hope to find his slides somewhere.)* p.39: Cramer's book seems to be a key link in the history of stats textbooks: Fisher wrote his Statistical Methods for Research Workers as a practical manual, without proofs. Then Cramer wrote Mathematical Methods of Statistics to fill in gaps and write entire proofs as needed. ""Cramer's book was used to teach a generation of new mathematicians and statisticians, and his redaction of Fisher became the standard paradigm.""This is not unlike the quote from economist Paul Samuelson: ""Let those who will write the nation's laws if I can write its textbooks.""* p.49: Maybe I find the ""degrees of freedom"" concept confusing because it ""was Fisher's discovery and was directly related to his geometric insights and his ability to cast the mathematical problems in terms of multidimensional geometry""---sadly not one of my strongest areas.* p.51: Fisher gave a 1947 series of talks about science on the BBC. I would love to find recordings but googling does not help, although some transcripts might be in The Listener magazine if I can find a library with access to this in its database.* p.59: Gumbel's Statistics of Extremes ""is a magnificently lucid presentation of a difficult subject, filled with references to the development of the subject. The first chapter ... alone is an excellent introduction to the mathematicals of statistical distribution theory. ... Although I first read the book after I had received my Ph.D. in mathematical statistics, I learned a great deal from that first chapter.""* p.66: ""Since the statistic is random, it makes no sense to talk about how accurate a single value of it is. ... What is needed is a criterion that depends upon the probability distribution of the statistic"" and Fisher was the one who first proposed a few such criteria (Consistency, Unbiasedness, Efficiency).* p.70-71: ""In the late 1960s, I had a programmable desk calculator. ... One afternoon, I programmed the machine, checked the first few steps to make sure I had not made an error in my program, turned off the light in my office, and left for home. Meanwhile, the programmable calculator was adding and subtracting, multiplying and dividing, silently, mumbling away in its electronic innards. Every once in a while it was programmed to print out a result. The printer on the machine was a noisy impact device that made a loud sound like ""BRRRAAAK.""The nighttime cleaning crew came into the building and one of the men took his broom and wastepaper collector into my office. There in the darkness, he could hear a humming. He could see the blue light of the calculator's one eye waxing and waning as it added and subtracted over and over again. Suddenly, the machine awoke. ""BRRAAK,"" it said, and then, ""BRRAAK, BRRAAK, BRRAAK, BRRRRAAAAK!"" He told me later that it was a terrifying experience and asked that I leave some sort of sign up the next time, warning that the computer was at work.""This delightful story reminds me of a similar anecdote about Robert Groves, former Director of the US Census Bureau.* p.75: ""The reader may recall those terrible moments in high school algebra when the book shifted into word problems. Mr. A and Mr. B were set rowing in still water or against a steady current, or maybe they were mixing water with oil, or bouncing a ball back and forth. Whatever it was, the word problem would propose some numbers and then ask a question, and the poor student had to put those words into a formula and solve for x. The reader may recall going back through the pages of the textbook, desperately seeking a similar problem that was worked out as an example and trying to stuff the new numbers into the formulas that were used in that example.In high school algebra, someone had already worked out the formulas. The teacher knew them or could find them in the teacher's manual for the textbook. Imagine a word problem where nobody knows how to turn it into a formula, where some of the information is redundant and should not be used, where crucial information is often missing, and where there is no similar example worked out earlier in the textbook. This is what happens when one tries to apply statistical models to real-life problems.""* p.84: ""The central limit theorem states that this distribution can be approximated by the normal probability distribution regardless of where the initial data came from."" Well, not quite! There are very important constraints on the original data that must be met before you can apply a CLT. For example, the mean of iid Cauchy random variables is another Cauchy, not approximately Normal. See some other CLT counterexamples in Bagui, Bhaumik, and Mehra (2013).* p.95-96: Nice example of how statistics differs from another mathematical approach, chaos theory, which can also be used to describe the world and make predictions(?), but (unlike statistics) has no measure of how well the model fits reality.* p.98: The word ""significant"" used to mean ""that the computation signified or showed something""---not necessarily something very important! Sadly, a shift in the English language changed the general usage of this word, making it a confusing term for students and users of statistics.* p.99: Fisher's succinct explanation of significance, from 1929: ""An observation is judged significant, if it would rarely have been produced, in the absence of a real cause of the kind we are seeking.""And from the same paper: ""The test of significance only tells him what to ignore, namely all experiments in which significant results are not obtained.""In other words, a nonsignificant result doesn't mean there is no effect, just that the effect wasn't measured well enough in this experiment. And a single significant result doesn't mean you've proven the effect exists---you must be able to ""design an experiment so that it will rarely fail to give a significant result.""* p.100: Salsburg's summary of Fisher's guidelines: ""If the p-value is very small (usually less than .01), he declares than an effect has been shown. If the p-value is large (usually greater than .20), he declares that, if there is an effect, it is so small that no experiment of this size will be able to detect it. If the p-value lies in between, he discusses how the next experiment should be designed to get a better idea of the effect.""I love this advice: if it's not significant, then you design a better experiment, not assume that the effect doesn't exist! Sadly this is not the way p-values are used in much of science nowadays.* p.102: I'd love to read the letters between Neyman and Egon Pearson, but they don't seem to be collected and published as far as I can tell.* p.108: Again from Fisher: ""tests of significance, when used accurately, are capable of rejecting or invalidating hypotheses, in so far as they are contradicted by the data: but ... they are never capable of establishing them as true""* p.112: I know of Keynes as an economist, but didn't realize he also studied probability and wrote A Treatise on Probability - Unabridged which ""demolishes [the frequentist definition of probability] as a useful or even meaningful interpretation, showing that it has fundamental inconsistencies that make it impossible to apply the frequentist definition in most cases where probability is invoked.""* p.113-115: Unfortunately, Neyman found frequentism the easiest way to build a mathematically tractable & consistent theory of hypothesis testing, and that's the version that became entrenched in textbooks everywhere, even though ""as early as 1935 ... he raised serious doubts"" and ""Neyman seldom made use of hypothesis tests directly."" It seems that hypothesis tests became popularized through Wald's work on decision theory and through Lehmann's textbook Testing Statistical Hypotheses.* p.115-116: I greatly admire Neyman and am proud to share his first name, but all this about how nice he was is a bit of a hagiography. He was a pretty nice guy but could be a jerk too and had some serious troubles at home, estranged from his wife and distant from his son. His biography Neyman is very good.* p.118: Nice explanation of how interval estimates help us decide whether the estimate is precise enough (i.e. the resulting policy decisions be the same whether the truth is near the lower or higher bound) or whether we need more data and better precision (i.e. the right decision would differ based on whether the lower or upper bound is true).* p.123: ""Fisher never got far with his fiducial distributions"" and I thought this was an abandoned dead-end after Fisher died, but it turns out people still study fiducial inference, including CMU's own Jessi Cisewski.* p.142: ""Godel once said that the gist of human genius is the longevity of one's youth.""* p.143: I used to wonder why we bother studying measure theory and foundations of probability---it's just proving things that seem obvious, right?---but before Kolmogorov put this all in order, all these ""obvious"" results were very much ad hoc, instead of being rigorously tied together. Likewise with Lebesgue's work on the foundations of calculus. Although the links seem obvious to us know, it was very different before Lebesgue and Kolmogorov, and I can't imagine what a change it must have been to read their work for the first time (without having already been exposed to the fruits of their labor like we have today).* p.146-147: Kolmogorov tried tackling the real-life interpretation of probability, in a very different way from his work on measure theoretical foundations, but apparently did not complete this project before his death and sadly nobody has been able to figure out where he was going with it.* p.148-150: Statistics can be highly political! It seems laughable today to think that Soviet planners would dismiss statistical work because ""random variable"" translates as ""accidental magnitude"" and the central planners felt insulted that their work could be considered accidental... But this lack of proper experimentation and evidence-based decisions led to massive starvation and economic weakness. Even apart from such extremes, governments have always tightly controlled the release of national statistics. Soviet statisticians were being threatened during the Cold War, and even today there are reports of Argentina repressing its statisticians for publishing damning inflation estimates."
1,0805071342,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8636703-amy,5,"I think this should be required reading for every young statistician. All the other majors seem to have some sort of History of [insert program name here], but I don't remember one from when I was working on my major (in statistics). I felt this book was exactly what it claimed to be--a description of how statistics revolutionized science in the 20th century. Some people seem to think that this book is supposed to describe statistical methods like an introductory textbook. If you want that, you should go read an introductory statistics textbook. It's not like there aren't plenty of those out there. This is a historical/philosophical look at how statistics has influenced science and vice versa. The book is organized according to topics in statistics including biographical sketches of the people important to the development and application of each of the topics. This can make it a little difficult to keep everything in perspective for how it fits in the timeline. But I don't think there would have been a better way to organize it anyway.I loved reading this book and found it entertaining, witty, and enlightening."
2,0805071342,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8587108-yokosuka14,2,"I really wanted to like this book. I love science history books, and while I am not a technical person, I appreciate the ""Physics for Poets"" level description that are a feature of many science history books. My problem with this book, and ultimately why I gave up is precisely due to the author's inability to handle the technical details. He says that he wife reminded him not to be too detailed, and ultimately he wasn't detailed enough. He described major changes in statistics, but it was hard to tell what those changes were. And frankly, many of the people described were not that interesting. They were statisticians after all."
3,0805071342,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2323418-abbey,4,"This was so interesting! It was so cool to hear about the actual people behind all of the names my stats training taught me - Pearson, Fisher, Tukey, Box, Cox, and more. It also served to show how young this field of statistics is in some ways, but how classic it is in others.This book does suffer from the law of misonomy that Salisbury mentions often - “the lady tasting tea” is in about three lines. I’m not sure what the reasoning was there, and it threw me for a bit early on. The author claims this is for non-technical, non-mathematical people, and he doesn’t include any formulas or proofs for that reason. That being said, I think statisticians, particularly of my own generation, are the best audience here, as I found the development of my chosen field super interesting."
4,0805071342,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1606092-nathaniel-hardman,3,"The first three chapters were the best. He started out with some really good stuff that was both biographically interesting and statistically informative. But is seemed like he lost steam. That said, there were still some good chapters and interesting anecdotes, and I generally enjoyed the book. I had to read about two-thirds for a class, and I finished the rest of it after the class was over, so that says something."
5,0805071342,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2392262-catherine,4,Fascinating history of statistics. (Doug says that's an oxymoron.)
6,0805071342,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45859662-george-goodall,3,"It's a book about statistics... but it doesn't actually talk about how to do stats. Instead, it's about the evolution of the practice of statistics told by someone who was in the front lines of its evolultion. Each chapter is dedicated to a person or development so that we see the field evolve over time. It's really a fantastic meditation on what we can do -- and should do -- with stats and what we can't. My favorite part relates to the lowly p-vale. Where on earth did this thing come from? Salsburg gives us a hint (p.99) -- ""The closest [Fisher] came to defining a specific p-value that would be significant in all circumstances occurred in an article printed in the Proceedings of the Society for Psychical Research in 1929."" He states in this article: ""It is a common practice to judge a result significant, if it is of such a magnitude that it would been produced by chance not more frequently than once in twenty trials. This is an arbitrary, but convenient, level of significance for the practical investigator, but it does not mean that he allows himself to be deceived once in every twenty experiments. The test of significance only tells him what to ignore, namely all experiments in which significant results are not obtained. He should only claim that a phenomenon is experimentally demonstrable when he knows how to design an experiment so that it will rarely fail to give a significant result."""

9,0805071342,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22673860-michael-bailey,5,Amazing book on the history of statistics and experimentation. a must read for all. 
10,0805071342,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76014-raghu,5,"The most popular image of Statistics we have is from Mark Twain’s re-tweet of the quote attributed to Benjamin Disraeli, ""There are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies, and statistics."". With the advent of computers and vast amount of storage, ever more data is available for crunching by scientists. Consequently, we have ever more conclusions based on data, not all of them unbiased. Politicians, environmentalists, businesses and scientists have all been guilty of selectively choosing data to push their agendas under the garb of ‘scientific conclusions based on real statistical data’. However, if we reflect carefully, we see that our well-being itself nowadays is understood only in terms of numbers and indices given to us by the science of Statistics. Without numbers like GDP growth rates, Consumer Price Index, Inflation rates, Unemployment rates, currency exchange rates etc, life as we know today would be a stumble in darkness. So, it is important to understand the role of Statistics in the modern world, what it means to us and how we can productively use it to improve our lives. This book by David Salsburg takes us through the important ideas and developments in Statistics during the past hundred years and more. It shows us the towering figures of this discipline, their contributions, their collaborations with one another as well as their profound disagreements and how it fundamentally changed the way science itself looked at understanding Nature. Statistics was one my subjects in the University. I used to have an understanding of it as a branch of Mathematics/Science where one collects and analyzes numerical data in large quantities. I understood its purpose to be the extraction of values, called parameters, out of this mass of data so that we can make sense of the reality that this data represents. The preface to this book, by the author himself, showed me how primitive this understanding is. He shows how Statistics moved the philosophical vision of Science away from a deterministic model of the Universe to a probabilistic model. In the nineteenth century, Science viewed the Universe as working on clockwork precision. A small number of Mathematical formulas, like Darwin’s, Newton’s and Boyle’s laws, could be used to describe reality and predict future events. What was needed were a set of such formulas and measurements with precision. But in practice, measurements lacked precision. The more the instruments were refined, the more scientists became aware of greater variations. The differences between what the models predicted and what was observed and measured grew bigger. The picture of the ‘clockwork universe’ lay in shambles. Science started moving towards a new paradigm - the statistical model of reality. Because statistical models of reality are mathematical, we can understand reality through the ideas of randomness, probability and statistics. In the twentieth century, the rise of Quantum Mechanics reinforced it substantially. I found this view of the evolution of Science in the twentieth century fresh and insightful.The book is mainly a selective history of statistics. Giants like Ronald Fisher, Karl Pearson, William Gosset, Francis Galton, Jerzy Neyman and W.E. Deming are all extensively covered for their seminal work as well as the struggles they had to wage to get their ideas accepted and at times, rejected. We see extensive biographical information and some gossip, at times. The work of many scientists is set in the social context of their times, because their work was carried out in totalitarian and post-colonial societies. For example, in the USSR, during the 1930s, communist orthodoxy was hostile to applied statistics. It affected the work of eminent scientists like Arnold Kolmogorov, who founded the axioms of probability. Indian statistical giants like P.C. Mahalanobis and C.R. Rao found themselves in more exciting times in a newly independent India in the 1950s, collecting and sorting important demographic data on the Indian population for the benefit of planning by the Nehru administration, which believed in using Science for development. W.E. Deming’s work on Quality control was given short schrift in his native USA, but the Japanese embraced it to emerge as the premium automakers of high quality in the 1980s. There is a special chapter in the book covering the contributions of women scientists like Stella Cunliffe, Judith Goldberg and others. The book details their advancements in various fields, which include more reliable pharmaceuticals, higher quality beer, econometrics, superior quality control in manufacturing, social policy and medical diagnostic tests. There are interesting discussions on whether there is a direct link between recidivism and the length of sentence of a prisoner. The accepted wisdom is that ‘the longer the sentence, the less the recidivism’. The author discusses Stella Cunliffe’s analysis of this question which exploded the myth of this association. The chapter ’The Man who remade Industry’ has compelling details on the great contributions of W.E. Deming on quality control and how it revolutionized the Japanese automobile industry. However, I shall just touch upon one fundamental insight the author outlines in the chapter, ‘Smoking and Cancer’, which captured my imagination.The chapter on ‘Smoking and Cancer’ is centered on a philosophical and analytical discussion on what is ‘cause and effect’. Author Salsburg says that Prof. Bertrand Russell effectively showed in the early 1930s that there is no such valid scientific concept as ‘cause and effect’! It is a vague, common notion that does not stand up to pure reason. It contains an inconsistent set of contradictory ideas and is of little or no value in scientific discourse! If it is so, what does it mean for us in society? Did Agent Orange cause those health problems in Vietnam and after? Does smoking cause cancer? The statistics giant, Ronald Fisher, a pipe smoker himself, did not believe smoking caused cancer. He pointed out that studies showed that people who did not inhale the smoke had a higher incidence of lung cancer than those who inhaled. This is inconsistent with the conclusion. Additionally, he mused, suppose that there was something genetic that induced some people to smoke than others. Suppose this same genetic disposition involved the occurrence of lung cancer. It was well known that many cancers have a familial component. Suppose this link between smoking and cancer was due to the same genetic disposition. To prove his case, Fisher assembled data on identical twins and showed that there was a strong familial tendency for both twins to be either smokers or non-smokers. He challenged others to show that lung cancer was not similarly genetically influenced. Fisher’s objections are motivated by science. Studies of smoking use data from what is called opportunity samples, or people who were smoking already. Ideally, one must do a study that asks half the participants to start smoking two packs or more a day and make observations. This is known as a double-blind study to prevent bias. But this is ethically untenable. Though a lot of evidence exists that smoking is bad, each one of them is in some way flawed as well.I found this analysis fascinating because we routinely accept so many ‘cause and effect’ claims by environmentalists and other social scientists without much scrutiny. Is the thinning of arctic sea ice really the cause of polar bears dying of starvation? Did DDT really cause cancer? Did the CFCs from refrigerators really cause the Ozone layer to vanish over the Antarctic? The final chapter titled ‘The idol with feet of clay’ is a philosophical look at the future. Salsburg says that the progress of Science implies that eventually the statistical revolution also will be overthrown in favor of a better one. Science produces a model that fits available data and uses it to predict results of new experiments. But, no model is fully accurate. So, more and more data results in more and more complicated models and their exceptions. At some point, it no longer serves the purpose and new thinkers emerge to create a revolution. One can see the Einsteinian revolution as one such event. In this sense, Salsburg says that the science of statistics also stands on feet of clay and that the revolution which may overthrow it, is perhaps already germinating amongst us.I found it an enjoyable book to read. I learnt a lot as well. "
11,0805071342,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1385106-jamie,3,"The full title here is The Lady Tasting Tea: How Statistics Revolutionized Science in the Twentieth Century. This book by David Salsburg is pretty much what the title suggests: part history of the rise of statistical methods in scientific research and part biography about the people responsible for it. This probably isn't a book for anyone not already versed in inferential statistics and related subjects. It won't, for example, teach you much about statistics, so you'll be pretty lost or at best unimpressed by most of the stories and adulations the book contains. I would have appreciated a bit more exposition and explanation, but for those of us with a background in stats, it keeps things at a sufficiently high level so that we're not forced to pull out our old textbooks just to know what's going on.And it's pretty interesting stuff. While Salsburg lacks (or at least holds in reserve) the panache and wit necessary to make this a really entertaining read, he does give glimpses into both the absurdity and mundanity of scientific process in this area. I was amused to learn, for example, that many august statistical techniques like analysis of variance were created so that someone could figure out how much artifical cow poop to spread over an acre of farm land. The book also tracks some of the more interesting personalities in the field, relating tales about how William Gossett created a now common and relatively simple procedure known as ""Student's t-test"" while working for a beer brewery (Guiness, no less) whose strict policies about sharing research forced him to publish under the (perhaps unimaginative) psudonym ""Student."" And then there were the cat fights and irrational, career-long grudges that these men and women slung around at each other. Though not quite on the level of say Bill Bryson's A Short History of Nearly Everything, this book does a decent job of layering those pedestrial and alltogether human eccentricities over the enormity of the scientific accomplishments they created.So while not exactly light reading and not for the uninitiated, it's a pretty interesting read."
12,0805071342,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20017524-malcolm-muscat-rodo,3,"I truly appreciate what the author of this book set out to do as it is not an easy thing. Collecting all the works and achievements of vastly different authors of many backgrounds and summarize their contribution to the Statistical Revolution in a cohesive narrative? Not easy. But in a weird way, he managed. Prior to purchasing this book I was made aware that this book might not be for everyone. As a statistics graduate, I enjoyed it because I could understand what he was saying (even though the vagueness at time left me curious as to what he meant). Is this good for people who are not versed in the field? Yes, but as anything in life, you need to stick with it and prepare yourself to not understand things completely. I appreciate the difficulty of his task and commend him for attempting to create a book to bring this subject down from the few to the many. So if you want to know more about this subject, but at the same time get a taste into some of the ideas behind the philosophies of the statistical revolution, then I would suggest this book for you.On a final note, I just would like to mention which parts of the book I enjoyed and which I didn't enjoy as much.The first half of the book was the most interesting I would say, as everything happens in quick succession so persons of interest become familiar names like characters in a novel.The second half of the book however begins to lose that narrative in my mind, jumping back and forth and forth, losing focus by mentioning characters whose importance is overstated to the point of feeling like the chapter that has been dedicated to their work becomes a biography, disconnected from the story. This however gets less frequent as the focus increases again as the end of the book gets nearer. "
13,0805071342,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68978799-bernard-m,3,"I saw the book as divided into the early chapters where he covers the formative history of modern statistics, focusing on Karl Pearson and Fischer, the middle chapters, in which he gives a series of biographical sketches of important contributors to statistics and finally the last chapter in which he discusses the philosophical implications and problems of statistics. I enjoyed the first and last part of the book, but I really wonder whether the short biographical sketches would interest anyone not already familiar with the statisticians involve. The chapter dedicated to Deming was of great interest to me, but that's because I already knew something of him--from a reader's perspective he deserved it. But did the Lady in Black deserve a whole chapter? Overall, the book does help the layperson understand that statistics is in fact a controversial field which skirts some philosophical topics as well. The last chapter in particular will hopefully spur readers into finding out more about the deeper problems and interpretations of probability and statistics, as it has for me. I realize the book is intended for laypersons, but I feel the author could have at least tried to make some of the ideas more concrete. For example, he mentions the forbidding topic of measure theory without the slightest effort at giving some verbal explanation of what it involves. What I had in mind is some more explanations such as the one he does in fact give of a probability space, using the probability of rain as an example, breaking down the different interpretations of this seemingly simple statement. I wish he had divided the material more clearly by the impact of statistics on science, business, politics and the military. "
14,0805071342,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5343048-michelle,1,"I love what David Salsburg attempts to do here: explain the basic concepts of statistics by guiding the reader through the history of its development as a discipline. Too often we learn concepts and methods that are popular today without understanding why we use them or how they developed. But however much I appreciate Salsburg's approach, I cannot recommend his book. It is inconsistently paced, lacking in any real explanations of the statistics, and peppered with ""when I met [so-and-so famous person]"" and ""when I invented this statistical term with [so-and-so famous person]"" name-dropping. The first chapters offer a mangled, difficult-to-follow history of the genesis of statistics. Salsburg introduces some basics of statistics, such as regression to the mean and skew distributions, but he wedges them into the narrative as afterthoughts. He literally spends a mere one to two sentences to explain a concept. I understand that this is not a statistics textbook, but a breakthrough new idea has no meaning to me unless I halfway understand what the idea is. Needless to say, there was a dissonance between Salsburg's excitement and my dull incomprehension of what was so exciting. In later chapters, the book becomes more of a biography per chapter, which was easier for me to take in but not how I would have chosen to organize a book on the development of statistics. My overall impression is that Salsburg made an outline of thoughts he jotted down, rearranged a few of the points, then fleshed out his half-baked outline into a book. The result is a book that isn't explanatory enough for a beginner and isn't detailed enough for an expert. "
15,0805071342,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45466691-keith,5,"Very interesting book! The first book on statistics I read in Chinese (translation), and the translation is almost flawless. Totally changed my view on statistics as a whole. Should have read it much earlier. The author gives a very thorough and yet reader-friendly account of the general development of statistics in the 20th century and how its fundamental ideas and philosophy revolutionised nearly every branch of science. The first half of the book, the more exiting part, centres on a couple of genius, including Fisher, Neymann and Kolmogorov, that laid the foundation for the field, as well as their intricate love-hate relationship.The second half gives an account of the widespread application of statistics in all scientific fields, and here we see the constant struggle between pure theorists and applied mathematicians. Pure mathematics is slightly disparaged for its abstractness, aloofness and detachment from the real world. I hope someone could pick up from where the book ends and introduces some new ideas in the field in recent years. I strongly believe the current big data fuss is just a phase, and the next Fisher or Kolmogorov will definitely bring something more exciting and revolutionary to the scientific world."
16,0805071342,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2436371-dennis-littrell,4,"Statistics humanized and triumphantThe title refers to the story about the English lady who believed she could tell by tasting whether the milk had been added to the tea or the tea added to the milk. We find out here that apparently she could. At least in the small sample of cases recorded, she ""identified every single one of the cups correctly."" (p. 8)The question--and this is the question that statisticians are forever trying to answer--is, was the result significant? Or how much faith should we put in such a result? What is the probability that such a result comes to us by chance rather than by causation? Did she simply guess right ten times in a row? Or, more saliently, how many times would she have to guess right before you'd be a believer? Or, more rigorously, how many times out of how many trials would she have to guess right before we can be confident that she isn't just guessing?Statistics then is a way of understanding and appreciating events without reference to causation. How cigarette smoking causes lung cancer is not exactly known. The fact that cigarette smoking does indeed cause lung cancer is demonstrated by a clear statistical correlation between smoking and the instance of lung cancer. But is a statistical correlation proof?Salsburg's very readable book is a narrative about the mathematicians who have tried to answer this and other statistical questions. The emphasis is on the mathematicians themselves, not on their mathematics. Indeed, following a time-honored ""rule"" in the book publishing business, a rule that insists that you lose ""x"" number of readers for every mathematical formula that appears on your pages, Salsburg has elected to use a grand total of zero.I was a little disconcerted about this. To encounter Bayes's theorem or any number of other statistical ideas and see not a single formula or mathematical expression was to me like reading a joke book without any jokes in it. But for those who have heard the jokes and are only interested in the joke tellers and their problems, this is indeed a fascinating book. It is ironic that this ""non-mathematical"" book is probably best appreciated by those with some experience with statistics. Such readers I suspect will be quite pleased to read about the lives of such greats in statistical theory and methods as Karl Pearson, R. A. Fisher, William Sealy ""Student"" Gosset, John Tukey, etc. Salsburg focuses on the problems that the individual mathematicians encountered and the solutions they came up with.Here's an example of how Salsburg does this neat trick of talking about mathematics without using any mathematics. He asks, ""What is the central limit theorem?"" (p. 84) and answers thusly:""The averages of large collections of numbers have a statistical distribution. The central limit theorem states that this distribution can be approximated by the normal probability distribution regardless of where the initial data came from. The normal probability distribution is the same as Laplace's error function. It is sometimes called the Gaussian distribution. It has been described loosely in popular works as the bell-shaped curve.""Perhaps this does work for a lot of people, but I think this book would be improved if there were an appendix with a list of ideas, presented in mathematical form. For a new edition, Salsburg might want to do something like that. Then this interesting book would also be a work of reference.My favorite method learned here is on page 236. Salsburg describes how John Tukey believes one should tally. Instead of making vertical lines and crossing every fifth one (which is what I have done for decades) Tukey recommends ""a ten-mark tally. You first mark four dots to make the corners of a box. You then connect the dots with four lines, completing the box. Finally, you make two diagonal marks forming a cross within the box.""That statistical ideas are inexorably tied up with the ideas of probability is explored in the final chapter of the book, ""The Idol with Feet of Clay."" Salsburg observes, along with Thomas Kuhn, that we are forever describing reality with ""a model...that appears to fit the data,"" but as the data accumulates our model ""begins to require modifications."" (p. 293) Reality in this sense is the postulated ""universe"" of the statistician, and our experiences and ""laws"" the result of ""samplings"" of that universe. Salsburg, citing L. Jonathan Cohen, goes on to recall Seymour Kyberg's ""lottery paradox"" which makes it clear that statistical/probabilistic ""proofs"" run into logical problems. He then asks if we really understand probability. He recalls the notion of ""personal probability"" (something I used to call ""psychological probability"") in which we appreciate the probability of something happening in terms of what effect it might have on us personally. Thus a small chance of getting something exceeding important to us (such as winning the lottery) might be worth paying more for the ticket than it is objectively worth. Salsburg concludes that we really do not understand probability except in the grossest sense (e.g., ""50/50"" or ""almost certain""). Then he asks, does it matter? His answer suggests quantum mechanics in which we work with probabilities without any pretense of grasping underlying ""laws.""Salsburg ends the book with a yearning for a new paradigm without feet of clay. I suspect he has in mind the undeniable and always troubling fact that the best that can ever be said about a sampling is that it has a certain probability of being an accurate reflection of the entire universe. However, my guess is that we will continue to have to be satisfied with ""only"" probabilistic knowledge; indeed that knowledge itself will always be subject to some degree of doubt. I might even conjecture that all real world knowledge, yearn as we might for certainty, is probabilistic. --Dennis Littrell, author of “The World Is Not as We Think It Is”"
17,0805071342,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53422885-roy-w-latham,5,"Okay, you have to have an unusual interest in statistics to enjoy this book, and it wouldn't hurt to have taken a course or two in the subject. I learned that nearly all of statistical analysis was developed in the 20th century, with much of work done by math genius R.A. Fisher in England. Fisher published an obscure handbook of formulas in the thirties, but figuring out just what Fisher had done and making it general knowledge continued into the 60s. The great bulk of modern science depends upon statistical analysis, and I think that late development of the science of statistics has led to many problems of misapplication. If it had all been developed 150 years ago, I think much greater emphasis would now be placed on that aspect of scientific education. the story of the development, including resistance to the concepts tells a tale of how modern science works and occasionally misfires."
18,0805071342,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3329275-ben,4,"I thoroughly enjoyed ""The Lady Tasting Tea: How Statistics Revolutionized Science in the Twentieth Century"" by David Salsburg. It was very entertaining and educational at the same time. The book recants the relatively short history of statistics highlighting many of the influential and colorful figures. I enjoyed learning about how key discoveries, such as the Student's T test, were made and under what circumstances. This book made me realize how much I take for granted the modern data-driven mindset and how relatively new of a mindset it is."
19,0805071342,http://goodreads.com/user/show/218742-abe-kazemzadeh,5,"This book is good to get a broad overview of 20th century statistics. I think I learn good when I know the people behind the ideas, so this book is a very good intro to the people of statistics. It makes statistics a lot more interesting than just reading equations. Also, it gives a better idea of the problems that statistics aims to solve. Stigler's book, Statistics on the Table, is a book I read after this one. It's more detailed and has a different writing style... I like both."
20,0805071342,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7742-jennifer-chin,4,"I really enjoyed this book. Even though I knew nothing about stats going in, I was able to understand (albeit at a very basic level) the concepts introduced. Throughout I started having little epiphanies about how statistics influences my (and most people's) every day lives.I also feel a little more prepared for my stats class this semester in that I have a real sense of why statistics is important, and how it makes data meaningful for decision-making."
21,0805071342,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11004626-gwern,2,"Odd, not that great. Problem is, Salsburg can't decide whether he's writing a history, a collection of biographies, anecdotes, or explaining modern statistics (early, frequentist, and Bayesian) to a layman, and so it winds up being nothing in particular.If you want statistics history, I'm sure there are better starting points (McGrayne's _Theory That Would Not Die_ being one that comes to mind)."
22,0805071342,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9347709-michael,4,I absolutely enjoyed reading this book. I highly recommend this book for all who teach stats as well as for all who have an interest in stats. It was interesting to learn about the personal lives of many statisticians in addition to their major contributions to the field. The reading was extremely accessible and engaging. Wish I would have read this much sooner. I'll be able to share more interesting information when teaching stats in the future.
23,0805071342,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11863182-igor,3,"This is a flawed book, poorly structured and struggling to explain concepts that underlie the statistical revolution in science. It would be better if there were a few equations or at least graphs to help with understanding.

It can be recommended to those who know the discipline well and want to learn more about its founders."

27,0805071342,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6007859-pete-wung,5,"This was not a book I had envisioned as being something that I would read, let alone grow to love. My experience with statistics had been limited to some courses I took in graduate school and then exposed to when I was on my first job, we were all exposed to statistical process control (SPC) and six sigma. My background in statistics only went so far as knowing some of the SPC tools. As I grew more mature I began to appreciate the usefulness of statistics but I had a hard time connecting the SPC tools I was exposed to with the mathematic heavy statistics that are taught in the textbooks. As I tried to parse through the dense formal statistical curriculum I grew frustrated with my own inability to get through to the kernel of the topic. As I struggled I kept seeing this particular book being recommended by a number of people, so I bought it and prepared for the worst, yet another dense explanation of rudimentary statistics that had very little to do with what I wanted.To my surprise and amazement, this book was so different, different from any other book that I had ever read. It was a love paean to the study of statistics, it was a gossipy and information laden history of the evolution of the art of probability and statistics, it was a summary of the important developments in statistics, it was an invaluable primer in the methods used in the practical application of statistic, and finally, it was a hefty philosophical discussion of the problems and issues that are still plaguing the researchers in statistics. I think you get the idea that I kind of liked reading this book.David Salzburg is a practitioner of the art of statistics, he has the ability to explain the very dense concepts in statistics, both the applied tools and the mathematical conundrums with adept ease. Most importantly he did this without employing any mathematics. Which in some ways is very impressive and in other times it was frustrating because it would have been more enlightening to resort to the bare bones mathematics, but no matter. Prof. Salzburg clearly has a great love for the story as well as for the subject, he has a great sense of history as well as a deft touch for the internecine nastiness that occurred with the giants of statistics. His descriptions of the relationship, or lack thereof between Pearson and Fisher kept me riveted to the narrative. His description of some of the great mathematicians who were caught in the destructive totalitarian regimes during and after World War II added the human dimension to these stories. I don’t know which aspect of the book I appreciated more, the historical perspective or the unraveling the mystery of the functional relationship between statistical tools and ideas. There is a clear devotion in his writing that reflects his devotion to giving credit where credit is due, even though he apologized for his inability to give credit to all that had contributed, the breadth and depth of the book was astounding and gratifying to someone who appreciates a truly “Big Picture” look at the statistical landscape from the 10,000 feet view. I particularly enjoyed the discussions regarding the contributions of Deming and Shewart to the SPC branch of the vast tree of statistical evolution. I was able to make the connections from those chapters to untie the knot that was in my mind.The piece de resistance was the final chapter where he discusses his own views on the unexplained philosophical contradictions still existing in statistics. It felt like I was in the midst of the discussion even though I am a dilettante in the art of statistics.This is a book that comprised of some very dense concepts and it was difficult to focus at times but it was well worth the effort in my mind."
28,0805071342,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14273576-zeyuan-hu,5,"I know this book since the junior year of college when my PhD roommate carries this book around as a way to take a break from intense research. The title looks interesting to me and one day, I ask him what good about this book. He answers with big smile: “This book is all about gossip in statistics”. I know back that time he is also taking a statistics course in sociology.Four years after that conversation, this book never appears in my life again. However, for no reason, his comment about this book, especially the word “gossip”, is engraved on my mind. So, I give it a try once I’m done with “The Road Less Traveled”. This book looks a good fit to me because based upon his comment, it’s not a really technical book that may require a silent study room, pencil and paper. Also, it’s about statistics on some level is exactly what I need because I’m always attracted to the machine learning, which has deep root in statistics.To be honest, this book is probably not best described by the word “gossip” because there is not really a lot of gossip involved. Although, I do learn that R.A Fisher really dislikes Jerzy Neyman and his “overly-abused” hypothesis testing; Egon Pearson overthrows his father, Karl Pearson’s work. To me, this book is more like a survey of the field with the aim to tell general audience about the development of mathematical statistics. I myself is also part of general audience in the sense that I’m not really into a mathematical-formula-dense book on a noisy subway. From this perspective, I think the author does a very good job by delivering idea of mathematic term without invoking mathematical formulas. This is particular useful for me because I can get an overview of each component in the field and their connections without studying a great deal of math. Lots of intuitions are actually from seeing “big picture” instead of worrying about some tedious calculation. Another good point of this book is that you can feel the excitement of the development of the field. Scientific development is motivated by the problems. This is especially true with statistics because statistics is essentially about using mathematical tools to discover the true nature of the data. Here, “the true nature” invokes lots of controversy in the field. The author does a good job to naturally develop the story and motivation behind the argument. Each chapter isn’t too long and it is self-contained as a complete story. One takeaway from reading this book is the idea about mathematical tools. Formulas are just formulas and unlike computer program, I never think about those mathematical formulas as “tools” for statistician to query the data. This has psychological impact on me because thinking about formulas as tools are just not as intimidating as thinking of formulas as formulas. Another good point about this book is that it lets me realize the assumption behind some mostly-commonly used technique, like hypothesis-testing. Every tool has its assumption, and it’s danger to abuse it without knowing what’s the motivation behind the invention of the tool.This book is definitely the book I’ll revisit a lot and I think it can be used to its full potential while you taking a class in statistics when you read the book."
29,0805071342,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4034261-abrakadabra,4,"In a way, a peculiar mix. Philosophy of statistics meets biographies of numerous statisticians. I really enjoyed the philosophical part, where the limitations of statistics approach are described, and many concepts and what we know about them are challenged. What I did not enjoy are all those biographies of statisticians who did great careers as statisticians in 19th century USA, but did not really re-think too many, if any statistical concepts. The part that described all those enthusiastic professors and government workers were honestly too boring. Maybe practicing American statisticians will still find it interesting to read about all the past colleagues and get inspired by their deeds. One more minus: for me, the formula-free approach of the book works fine more or less, because I know most of the theorems are lemmas well enough, so it is just a nice challenge to understand what Salsburg means, based on the description. Still, I wouldn't be harmed by more mathematical notation and formulations. I also think that someone without background in statistics will not understand the concepts or get enthusiastic about them based on their intuitive and those often a bit vague description. Why was all the notation then left out?Altogether I would give the book maybe 3.5 stars out of 5, let's round to four as there are not that many books of this sort on the market. In a way maybe a must read to anyone who has studied statistics. Sometimes it is not easy to give life and meaning to all the formulas you learn, or think of suitable applications of the concept of martingales, for instance. Here you will find plenty of nice examples.*One more thing: the book seemed quite centered around English-speaking countries and their experiences with statistics. I understand that many, if not most of statistical concepts I know have come from English-speaking world, but still it leaves me wonder how the book might have looked like, if the author would have been French, Russian or Swedish, for instance."
30,0805071342,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32169516-dominic-dayta,5,"I ate through this book like a fever - a particularly terminal one. This is exactly what I felt was missing in my undergraduate studies, an introductory course to Statistics, not the body of mathematical abstractions and methodologies, but the people that made it into the wild, all-encompassing discipline that it is today. Weird to think that it is only now that I'm associating a face, a life, to the names that I continuously had to deal with in my undergraduate years and now while I approach the end of my masters. Neyman being afraid of Fisher's criticisms, Egon Pearson establishing his own journal for fear of angering his father Karl by working with Neyman on Fisher's idea of the likelihood function and developing the theory of hypothesis testing. Fisher moving from being the lowly genius marked by its then tyrant Karl Pearson into being its own feared but at the same time revered tyrant.I did find problems in Salsburg's unwillingness to invoke even a single line of mathematical complexity into the book, which results in him trailing off into other topics just when his discussion of a particular development hits full stride. But alas, this is a book written for the nonmathematicians, and to that end, certain tradeoffs must be made. It certainly did not affect my enjoyment of the book. A week from starting it and I come out with a relived appreciation for the field I've committed myself into, and to the men and women who built its foundations. This is a book that I highly recommend for young statisticians, and those who are considering statistics as a prospective field of study."

What could be more engrossing than a hagiography of bean counters?I read this book because I have a vague interest in statistics, but a very poor foundation for grappling with the actual math. If I've taken away an appreciation for the concepts that have driven the remarkable ""statistical revolution"" that I, like most readers, was not aware that we have just experienced, it's at an entirely subconscious level. I'm sure I can't now expound wisely on the usefulness and pitfalls of P-values, or explain non-Bayesian vs. Bayesian approaches. Thanks to this surprisingly readable, if appropriately non-exciting history, perhaps I'll be able to get a little traction next time I try to tread that territory.To Salsburg's credit, it was not actually boring, given that the ""action"" described was the presentation of papers at conventions, or the inclusion of names in bibliographies. I've developed a pretty high tolerance for the prosaic, however, so no promises.Recommended audience: students of statistics who want to know more about their heroes; people like me who will pick up anything from the ""light science"" shelf in the library and, once committed, stick with it out of pride, or for the heck of it.Favorite fact: (spoiler alert) Some of the great advances in modern statistics were made on behalf of the Guinness brewery, in their continuing effort to improve and maintain the consistency of their tasty, tasty beverage."
32,0805071342,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38280411-john-fuller,2," A seemingly thorough overview of the history of statistics and the various people in it, but there are so many names and characters whizzing by that sometimes the statistics itself is left behind. There are several times where the author mentions an important theory or development, only to give it the barest explanation, or none at all. Understandably this is not a book about statistics itself, and to attempt to satisfactorily explain and prove the broad collection of ideas within it would likely require multiple volumes.  The book at its best in the beginning, before branching off in every which way, when examining the very beginning of the field, with Gosset and Pearson and Fisher. As it continues, and more and more characters are introduced, it becomes difficult to keep track of the landscape, or of a strong logical flow to the arrangement of chapters. For a person already familiar with some of the history of statistics or with the theory itself this may be fine, but for a relative neophytes like myself it makes for a more difficult read.  Despite its flaws, the book is still interesting and coherent enough to be worth the read, though some later chapters are skippable. "

A wonderful review of the development of Statistics in the 20th century as a consolidated and respected field of knowledge is given. Mr. Salsburg is very careful to not cross the line between giving details and being too technical, so the concepts and ideas are shown in great detail but without mathematics, what makes possible a fluid and smooth reading.He also emphasizes that, although many famous names are males statisticians, a lot of women has contributed and headed the revolution in Statistics, so at least some chapters of the book are dedicated to these women.Much more than simply compiling a lot of historical information, the author goes further and provides insights into the philosophical aspects of Statistics, generating interesting and delightful discussions, inciting the reader to think about this.I`ve finished the book with some better grasp of what statistics and probability can bring and mean into our lives and put it into my (physical) shelf with a will to study and dive into these subjects."
34,0805071342,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3265556-converse,3," This book is an informal history of the development of statistics in the 20th century. The author, who was a statistician in the pharmaceutical industry, had meant many of the statisticians whose work he discusses. It is not a mathematical book, in the sense that not a line of algebra is to be found in it.  The author begins with Karl Pearson in Britain at the begining of the twentieth century, when he took over Francis Galton (cousin of Charles Darwin, promoter of the use of fingerprints in identification, and eugenicist) biometrical (measuring people) laboratory in London. Pearson believed that the aim of science, in a world where the objects of study show ubiquitous numerical variation in the measurement of any trait you care to mention, should be the determination of the smaller number of parameters (numbers like the average, the standard deviation, plus some more obscure ones like symmetry and kurtosis) that describe the distribution of variability of a trait. Pearson's importance was greatly inhanced by his ediotrial control over an important scientific journal, Biometrika  In this journal, Pearson early on published the work of William Gosset, the developer of a most useful statisticial test called the t test, with which one can determine how likely it is that two different samples with different means are in fact different. Gosset had to published under a pen name because his employer, the Guiness brewery, forbade its employees to publish after an unfortunate incident when a brewer gave out some trade secrets.  The next great figure, definitely of the most important statisticians, possibly the most important, and scientists of the 20th century was R. A. Fisher. Fisher developed most of the statistical techniques, such as analysis of variance, that I used 80 years later to analyze, interpret, and design experiments. Fisher combined great mathematical insight with the writing of a book,  Statistical Methods for Research Workers , that showed us lesser mortals how to go about designing and analyzing experiments in a proper manner without worrying us about how these methods worked. Unfortunately for proper mathematicians, he was less good in explaining in his other publications how he derived his methods, and in some cases I gather he never published any derivation. However his unpublished papers show he wasn't making it all up, indeed as late as the 1970s those who examined his unpublished work learned new insights. Gradually other math types filled in or found on their own the detailed proofs.  The other candidate for worlds greatest statistician would be A. N. Kolmogorov, who put probability on a firm mathematical foundation (among many other things). As this work is a necessary condition for statistical application to be valid, this is very important. He was also an important developer of statistical methods. Kolomogorov was a Soviet citizen of astonishingly wide interests (he spent a good deal of time teaching gifted children at a special Moscow school), and great kindness.  The third most important statistician would probably be Jerzy Neyman, a man of Polish antecedents who spent much of his career in the United States. Neyman, along with Egon Pearson (Karl's son) was the developer of the now ubiqutious notion of hypothesis testing. Neyman also developed the concept of a confidence interval. In hypothesis testing you determine how often an experimental outcome, called the null hypothesis, would occur do to chance alone. If this probability is below a small but arbitrary value, one concludes that the null hypothesis is rejected, and that the alternative hypothesis is correct. An example of confidence intervals is when a poll's results state that the president's approval rate is 45%, plus or minus 3%, with 95% confidence. Both of these ideas are controversial as well as very commonly used, in part because their meaning in application (the math is perfectly rigorous)becomes less clear the more you examine them.  Besides the greats, the author covers many other people (including John Tukey, who probably should be included in the list of greats), who made important contributions to statistics. He also covers other techniques than the ones I mentioned above, such as experimental design, non-parametric statistics, computer intensive methods such as the bootstrap, and Bayesian statistics.  The author also brings up the philosophical matters that continue to bedevil statistics, such as the meaning of a probability. The most common approach is the frequentist school, in which a probability is the fraction of total outcomes in which a particular outcome (say winning the lottery divided by the number of tickets you've bought) is observed. There are difficulties with this approach, as there are with alternative Bayesian approaches. I think the author is mistaken in his apparent belief that issue is primarily limited to applications of statistics; I would says that it is problem with all forms of knowledge which depend to some extent on induction, the drawing of conclusions from necessarily limited numbers of experiences.  The book includes a bibliography, including a most helpful annotated section of recommended books that are light on the math. There is also a chronology of developments in statistics.  I enjoyed the book. I found some of the discussions of statistical issues unclear, which I attribute to the author's unwillingness to introduce any mathematical notation in order to avoid scaring off readers. I think a little math at the level of simple algebra, possibly separated from the main text in separate boxes so as not to disturb the flow of the narrative, would have been helpful in this regard. "
35,0805071342,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75572772-tyler-varisco,5,"This book is a wonderful history of statistics. Salsburg does an excellent job of providing a truly human history of the names and methods we have all become so familiar with. This is not, however, a book of mathematical theory. Still, in his conclusion, Salsburg provides a brief overview of the epistemological problems associated with our interpretation of probability, enough so to make me think more about how I sling around P values as a researcher.

What could be more engrossing than a hagiography of bean counters?I read this book because I have a vague interest in statistics, but a very poor foundation for grappling with the actual math. If I've taken away an appreciation for the concepts that have driven the remarkable ""statistical revolution"" that I, like most readers, was not aware that we have just experienced, it's at an entirely subconscious level. I'm sure I can't now expound wisely on the usefulness and pitfalls of P-values, or explain non-Bayesian vs. Bayesian approaches. Thanks to this surprisingly readable, if appropriately non-exciting history, perhaps I'll be able to get a little traction next time I try to tread that territory.To Salsburg's credit, it was not actually boring, given that the ""action"" described was the presentation of papers at conventions, or the inclusion of names in bibliographies. I've developed a pretty high tolerance for the prosaic, however, so no promises.Recommended audience: students of statistics who want to know more about their heroes; people like me who will pick up anything from the ""light science"" shelf in the library and, once committed, stick with it out of pride, or for the heck of it.Favorite fact: (spoiler alert) Some of the great advances in modern statistics were made on behalf of the Guinness brewery, in their continuing effort to improve and maintain the consistency of their tasty, tasty beverage."
62,0805071342,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38280411-john-fuller,2," A seemingly thorough overview of the history of statistics and the various people in it, but there are so many names and characters whizzing by that sometimes the statistics itself is left behind. There are several times where the author mentions an important theory or development, only to give it the barest explanation, or none at all. Understandably this is not a book about statistics itself, and to attempt to satisfactorily explain and prove the broad collection of ideas within it would likely require multiple volumes.  The book at its best in the beginning, before branching off in every which way, when examining the very beginning of the field, with Gosset and Pearson and Fisher. As it continues, and more and more characters are introduced, it becomes difficult to keep track of the landscape, or of a strong logical flow to the arrangement of chapters. For a person already familiar with some of the history of statistics or with the theory itself this may be fine, but for a relative neophytes like myself it makes for a more difficult read.  Despite its flaws, the book is still interesting and coherent enough to be worth the read, though some later chapters are skippable. "
63,0805071342,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52508910-lu-s-caparroz,5,"The author communicates extremely well given his audience and goals. A wonderful review of the development of Statistics in the 20th century as a consolidated and respected field of knowledge is given. Mr. Salsburg is very careful to not cross the line between giving details and being too technical, so the concepts and ideas are shown in great detail but without mathematics, what makes possible a fluid and smooth reading.He also emphasizes that, although many famous names are males statisticians, a lot of women has contributed and headed the revolution in Statistics, so at least some chapters of the book are dedicated to these women.Much more than simply compiling a lot of historical information, the author goes further and provides insights into the philosophical aspects of Statistics, generating interesting and delightful discussions, inciting the reader to think about this.I`ve finished the book with some better grasp of what statistics and probability can bring and mean into our lives and put it into my (physical) shelf with a will to study and dive into these subjects."
64,0805071342,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3265556-converse,3," This book is an informal history of the development of statistics in the 20th century. The author, who was a statistician in the pharmaceutical industry, had meant many of the statisticians whose work he discusses. It is not a mathematical book, in the sense that not a line of algebra is to be found in it.  The author begins with Karl Pearson in Britain at the begining of the twentieth century, when he took over Francis Galton (cousin of Charles Darwin, promoter of the use of fingerprints in identification, and eugenicist) biometrical (measuring people) laboratory in London. Pearson believed that the aim of science, in a world where the objects of study show ubiquitous numerical variation in the measurement of any trait you care to mention, should be the determination of the smaller number of parameters (numbers like the average, the standard deviation, plus some more obscure ones like symmetry and kurtosis) that describe the distribution of variability of a trait. Pearson's importance was greatly inhanced by his ediotrial control over an important scientific journal, Biometrika  In this journal, Pearson early on published the work of William Gosset, the developer of a most useful statisticial test called the t test, with which one can determine how likely it is that two different samples with different means are in fact different. Gosset had to published under a pen name because his employer, the Guiness brewery, forbade its employees to publish after an unfortunate incident when a brewer gave out some trade secrets.  The next great figure, definitely of the most important statisticians, possibly the most important, and scientists of the 20th century was R. A. Fisher. Fisher developed most of the statistical techniques, such as analysis of variance, that I used 80 years later to analyze, interpret, and design experiments. Fisher combined great mathematical insight with the writing of a book,  Statistical Methods for Research Workers , that showed us lesser mortals how to go about designing and analyzing experiments in a proper manner without worrying us about how these methods worked. Unfortunately for proper mathematicians, he was less good in explaining in his other publications how he derived his methods, and in some cases I gather he never published any derivation. However his unpublished papers show he wasn't making it all up, indeed as late as the 1970s those who examined his unpublished work learned new insights. Gradually other math types filled in or found on their own the detailed proofs.  The other candidate for worlds greatest statistician would be A. N. Kolmogorov, who put probability on a firm mathematical foundation (among many other things). As this work is a necessary condition for statistical application to be valid, this is very important. He was also an important developer of statistical methods. Kolomogorov was a Soviet citizen of astonishingly wide interests (he spent a good deal of time teaching gifted children at a special Moscow school), and great kindness.  The third most important statistician would probably be Jerzy Neyman, a man of Polish antecedents who spent much of his career in the United States. Neyman, along with Egon Pearson (Karl's son) was the developer of the now ubiqutious notion of hypothesis testing. Neyman also developed the concept of a confidence interval. In hypothesis testing you determine how often an experimental outcome, called the null hypothesis, would occur do to chance alone. If this probability is below a small but arbitrary value, one concludes that the null hypothesis is rejected, and that the alternative hypothesis is correct. An example of confidence intervals is when a poll's results state that the president's approval rate is 45%, plus or minus 3%, with 95% confidence. Both of these ideas are controversial as well as very commonly used, in part because their meaning in application (the math is perfectly rigorous)becomes less clear the more you examine them.  Besides the greats, the author covers many other people (including John Tukey, who probably should be included in the list of greats), who made important contributions to statistics. He also covers other techniques than the ones I mentioned above, such as experimental design, non-parametric statistics, computer intensive methods such as the bootstrap, and Bayesian statistics.  The author also brings up the philosophical matters that continue to bedevil statistics, such as the meaning of a probability. The most common approach is the frequentist school, in which a probability is the fraction of total outcomes in which a particular outcome (say winning the lottery divided by the number of tickets you've bought) is observed. There are difficulties with this approach, as there are with alternative Bayesian approaches. I think the author is mistaken in his apparent belief that issue is primarily limited to applications of statistics; I would says that it is problem with all forms of knowledge which depend to some extent on induction, the drawing of conclusions from necessarily limited numbers of experiences.  The book includes a bibliography, including a most helpful annotated section of recommended books that are light on the math. There is also a chronology of developments in statistics.  I enjoyed the book. I found some of the discussions of statistical issues unclear, which I attribute to the author's unwillingness to introduce any mathematical notation in order to avoid scaring off readers. I think a little math at the level of simple algebra, possibly separated from the main text in separate boxes so as not to disturb the flow of the narrative, would have been helpful in this regard. "

Salsburg does an excellent job of providing a truly human history of the names and methods we have all become so familiar with. This is not, however, a book of mathematical theory.

94,0805071342,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3265556-converse,3," This book is an informal history of the development of statistics in the 20th century. The author, who was a statistician in the pharmaceutical industry, had meant many of the statisticians whose work he discusses. It is not a mathematical book, in the sense that not a line of algebra is to be found in it.  The author begins with Karl Pearson in Britain at the begining of the twentieth century, when he took over Francis Galton (cousin of Charles Darwin, promoter of the use of fingerprints in identification, and eugenicist) biometrical (measuring people) laboratory in London. Pearson believed that the aim of science, in a world where the objects of study show ubiquitous numerical variation in the measurement of any trait you care to mention, should be the determination of the smaller number of parameters (numbers like the average, the standard deviation, plus some more obscure ones like symmetry and kurtosis) that describe the distribution of variability of a trait. Pearson's importance was greatly inhanced by his ediotrial control over an important scientific journal, Biometrika  In this journal, Pearson early on published the work of William Gosset, the developer of a most useful statisticial test called the t test, with which one can determine how likely it is that two different samples with different means are in fact different. Gosset had to published under a pen name because his employer, the Guiness brewery, forbade its employees to publish after an unfortunate incident when a brewer gave out some trade secrets.  The next great figure, definitely of the most important statisticians, possibly the most important, and scientists of the 20th century was R. A. Fisher. Fisher developed most of the statistical techniques, such as analysis of variance, that I used 80 years later to analyze, interpret, and design experiments. Fisher combined great mathematical insight with the writing of a book,  Statistical Methods for Research Workers , that showed us lesser mortals how to go about designing and analyzing experiments in a proper manner without worrying us about how these methods worked. Unfortunately for proper mathematicians, he was less good in explaining in his other publications how he derived his methods, and in some cases I gather he never published any derivation. However his unpublished papers show he wasn't making it all up, indeed as late as the 1970s those who examined his unpublished work learned new insights. Gradually other math types filled in or found on their own the detailed proofs.  The other candidate for worlds greatest statistician would be A. N. Kolmogorov, who put probability on a firm mathematical foundation (among many other things). As this work is a necessary condition for statistical application to be valid, this is very important. He was also an important developer of statistical methods. Kolomogorov was a Soviet citizen of astonishingly wide interests (he spent a good deal of time teaching gifted children at a special Moscow school), and great kindness.  The third most important statistician would probably be Jerzy Neyman, a man of Polish antecedents who spent much of his career in the United States. Neyman, along with Egon Pearson (Karl's son) was the developer of the now ubiqutious notion of hypothesis testing. Neyman also developed the concept of a confidence interval. In hypothesis testing you determine how often an experimental outcome, called the null hypothesis, would occur do to chance alone. If this probability is below a small but arbitrary value, one concludes that the null hypothesis is rejected, and that the alternative hypothesis is correct. An example of confidence intervals is when a poll's results state that the president's approval rate is 45%, plus or minus 3%, with 95% confidence. Both of these ideas are controversial as well as very commonly used, in part because their meaning in application (the math is perfectly rigorous)becomes less clear the more you examine them.  Besides the greats, the author covers many other people (including John Tukey, who probably should be included in the list of greats), who made important contributions to statistics. He also covers other techniques than the ones I mentioned above, such as experimental design, non-parametric statistics, computer intensive methods such as the bootstrap, and Bayesian statistics.  The author also brings up the philosophical matters that continue to bedevil statistics, such as the meaning of a probability. The most common approach is the frequentist school, in which a probability is the fraction of total outcomes in which a particular outcome (say winning the lottery divided by the number of tickets you've bought) is observed. There are difficulties with this approach, as there are with alternative Bayesian approaches. I think the author is mistaken in his apparent belief that issue is primarily limited to applications of statistics; I would says that it is problem with all forms of knowledge which depend to some extent on induction, the drawing of conclusions from necessarily limited numbers of experiences.  The book includes a bibliography, including a most helpful annotated section of recommended books that are light on the math. There is also a chronology of developments in statistics.  I enjoyed the book. I found some of the discussions of statistical issues unclear, which I attribute to the author's unwillingness to introduce any mathematical notation in order to avoid scaring off readers. I think a little math at the level of simple algebra, possibly separated from the main text in separate boxes so as not to disturb the flow of the narrative, would have been helpful in this regard. "

Still, in his conclusion, Salsburg provides a brief overview of the epistemological problems associated with our interpretation of probability, enough so to make me think more about how I sling around P values as a researcher. More than anything, this book made me appreciate how hard it once was to actually calculate statistics, something that computers have certainly made us take for granted. This book should be required reading for first year graduate students in the physical and life sciences. "

More a collection of vignettes about different statisticians than a comprehensive history, the book has its best moments in the anecdotal description of its subjects, often drawing from Salsburg's own experience with them. While the book is written for non-experts, I am wondering how much a reader without a background in statistics will understand: The explanations are often more allusions to than descriptions of the innovations discussed. Having an interest in the field, though, the book humanises a lot of the great names in statistics."

It was interesting, and the subject matter is so impactful, I wanted to love it.However, I found it lacking both in math (some times you just need math - i get that the author wanted to make it accessible to everyone, but, sometimes the concepts just weren't clear enough without), and in narrative structure. The book jumped around a little bit, and occasionally it was challenging to follow a thread.The author's love for the subject matter and the subjects was quite clear, though."

It is an interesting read about the characters behind many of the most widely used statistical methods. As with most people in the world, the statisticians who built the foundation for modern stats were far from perfect. They fought with each other over statistical methods and theory and had minor and major character flaws (e.g., supporting Eugenics). "

What could be more engrossing than a hagiography of bean counters?I read this book because I have a vague interest in statistics, but a very poor foundation for grappling with the actual math. If I've taken away an appreciation for the concepts that have driven the remarkable ""statistical revolution"" that I, like most readers, was not aware that we have just experienced, it's at an entirely subconscious level. I'm sure I can't now expound wisely on the usefulness and pitfalls of P-values, or explain non-Bayesian vs. Bayesian approaches. Thanks to this surprisingly readable, if appropriately non-exciting history, perhaps I'll be able to get a little traction next time I try to tread that territory.To Salsburg's credit, it was not actually boring, given that the ""action"" described was the presentation of papers at conventions, or the inclusion of names in bibliographies. I've developed a pretty high tolerance for the prosaic, however, so no promises.Recommended audience: students of statistics who want to know more about their heroes; people like me who will pick up anything from the ""light science"" shelf in the library and, once committed, stick with it out of pride, or for the heck of it.Favorite fact: (spoiler alert) Some of the great advances in modern statistics were made on behalf of the Guinness brewery, in their continuing effort to improve and maintain the consistency of their tasty, tasty beverage."
152,0805071342,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38280411-john-fuller,2," A seemingly thorough overview of the history of statistics and the various people in it, but there are so many names and characters whizzing by that sometimes the statistics itself is left behind. There are several times where the author mentions an important theory or development, only to give it the barest explanation, or none at all. Understandably this is not a book about statistics itself, and to attempt to satisfactorily explain and prove the broad collection of ideas within it would likely require multiple volumes.  The book at its best in the beginning, before branching off in every which way, when examining the very beginning of the field, with Gosset and Pearson and Fisher. As it continues, and more and more characters are introduced, it becomes difficult to keep track of the landscape, or of a strong logical flow to the arrangement of chapters. For a person already familiar with some of the history of statistics or with the theory itself this may be fine, but for a relative neophytes like myself it makes for a more difficult read.  Despite its flaws, the book is still interesting and coherent enough to be worth the read, though some later chapters are skippable. "

Mr. Salsburg is very careful to not cross the line between giving details and being too technical, so the concepts and ideas are shown in great detail but without mathematics, what makes possible a fluid and smooth reading.He also emphasizes that, although many famous names are males statisticians, a lot of women has contributed and headed the revolution in Statistics, so at least some chapters of the book are dedicated to these women.Much more than simply compiling a lot of historical information, the author goes further and provides insights into the philosophical aspects of Statistics, generating interesting and delightful discussions, inciting the reader to think about this.I`ve finished the book with some better grasp of what statistics and probability can bring and mean into our lives and put it into my (physical) shelf with a will to study and dive into these subjects."
154,0805071342,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3265556-converse,3," This book is an informal history of the development of statistics in the 20th century. The author, who was a statistician in the pharmaceutical industry, had meant many of the statisticians whose work he discusses. It is not a mathematical book, in the sense that not a line of algebra is to be found in it.  The author begins with Karl Pearson in Britain at the begining of the twentieth century, when he took over Francis Galton (cousin of Charles Darwin, promoter of the use of fingerprints in identification, and eugenicist) biometrical (measuring people) laboratory in London. Pearson believed that the aim of science, in a world where the objects of study show ubiquitous numerical variation in the measurement of any trait you care to mention, should be the determination of the smaller number of parameters (numbers like the average, the standard deviation, plus some more obscure ones like symmetry and kurtosis) that describe the distribution of variability of a trait. Pearson's importance was greatly inhanced by his ediotrial control over an important scientific journal, Biometrika  In this journal, Pearson early on published the work of William Gosset, the developer of a most useful statisticial test called the t test, with which one can determine how likely it is that two different samples with different means are in fact different. Gosset had to published under a pen name because his employer, the Guiness brewery, forbade its employees to publish after an unfortunate incident when a brewer gave out some trade secrets.  The next great figure, definitely of the most important statisticians, possibly the most important, and scientists of the 20th century was R. A. Fisher. Fisher developed most of the statistical techniques, such as analysis of variance, that I used 80 years later to analyze, interpret, and design experiments. Fisher combined great mathematical insight with the writing of a book,  Statistical Methods for Research Workers , that showed us lesser mortals how to go about designing and analyzing experiments in a proper manner without worrying us about how these methods worked. Unfortunately for proper mathematicians, he was less good in explaining in his other publications how he derived his methods, and in some cases I gather he never published any derivation. However his unpublished papers show he wasn't making it all up, indeed as late as the 1970s those who examined his unpublished work learned new insights. Gradually other math types filled in or found on their own the detailed proofs.  The other candidate for worlds greatest statistician would be A. N. Kolmogorov, who put probability on a firm mathematical foundation (among many other things). As this work is a necessary condition for statistical application to be valid, this is very important. He was also an important developer of statistical methods. Kolomogorov was a Soviet citizen of astonishingly wide interests (he spent a good deal of time teaching gifted children at a special Moscow school), and great kindness.  The third most important statistician would probably be Jerzy Neyman, a man of Polish antecedents who spent much of his career in the United States. Neyman, along with Egon Pearson (Karl's son) was the developer of the now ubiqutious notion of hypothesis testing. Neyman also developed the concept of a confidence interval. In hypothesis testing you determine how often an experimental outcome, called the null hypothesis, would occur do to chance alone. If this probability is below a small but arbitrary value, one concludes that the null hypothesis is rejected, and that the alternative hypothesis is correct. An example of confidence intervals is when a poll's results state that the president's approval rate is 45%, plus or minus 3%, with 95% confidence. Both of these ideas are controversial as well as very commonly used, in part because their meaning in application (the math is perfectly rigorous)becomes less clear the more you examine them.  Besides the greats, the author covers many other people (including John Tukey, who probably should be included in the list of greats), who made important contributions to statistics. He also covers other techniques than the ones I mentioned above, such as experimental design, non-parametric statistics, computer intensive methods such as the bootstrap, and Bayesian statistics.  The author also brings up the philosophical matters that continue to bedevil statistics, such as the meaning of a probability. The most common approach is the frequentist school, in which a probability is the fraction of total outcomes in which a particular outcome (say winning the lottery divided by the number of tickets you've bought) is observed. There are difficulties with this approach, as there are with alternative Bayesian approaches. I think the author is mistaken in his apparent belief that issue is primarily limited to applications of statistics; I would says that it is problem with all forms of knowledge which depend to some extent on induction, the drawing of conclusions from necessarily limited numbers of experiences.  The book includes a bibliography, including a most helpful annotated section of recommended books that are light on the math. There is also a chronology of developments in statistics.  I enjoyed the book. I found some of the discussions of statistical issues unclear, which I attribute to the author's unwillingness to introduce any mathematical notation in order to avoid scaring off readers. I think a little math at the level of simple algebra, possibly separated from the main text in separate boxes so as not to disturb the flow of the narrative, would have been helpful in this regard. "
155,0805071342,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75572772-tyler-varisco,5,"This book is a wonderful history of statistics. Salsburg does an excellent job of providing a truly human history of the names and methods we have all become so familiar with. This is not, however, a book of mathematical theory. Still, in his conclusion, Salsburg provides a brief overview of the epistemological problems associated with our interpretation of probability, enough so to make me think more about how I sling around P values as a researcher. More than anything, this book made me appreciate how hard it once was to actually calculate statistics, something that computers have certainly made us take for granted. This book should be required reading for first year graduate students in the physical and life sciences. "

184,0805071342,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3265556-converse,3," This book is an informal history of the development of statistics in the 20th century. The author, who was a statistician in the pharmaceutical industry, had meant many of the statisticians whose work he discusses. It is not a mathematical book, in the sense that not a line of algebra is to be found in it.  The author begins with Karl Pearson in Britain at the begining of the twentieth century, when he took over Francis Galton (cousin of Charles Darwin, promoter of the use of fingerprints in identification, and eugenicist) biometrical (measuring people) laboratory in London. Pearson believed that the aim of science, in a world where the objects of study show ubiquitous numerical variation in the measurement of any trait you care to mention, should be the determination of the smaller number of parameters (numbers like the average, the standard deviation, plus some more obscure ones like symmetry and kurtosis) that describe the distribution of variability of a trait. Pearson's importance was greatly inhanced by his ediotrial control over an important scientific journal, Biometrika  In this journal, Pearson early on published the work of William Gosset, the developer of a most useful statisticial test called the t test, with which one can determine how likely it is that two different samples with different means are in fact different. Gosset had to published under a pen name because his employer, the Guiness brewery, forbade its employees to publish after an unfortunate incident when a brewer gave out some trade secrets.  The next great figure, definitely of the most important statisticians, possibly the most important, and scientists of the 20th century was R. A. Fisher. Fisher developed most of the statistical techniques, such as analysis of variance, that I used 80 years later to analyze, interpret, and design experiments. Fisher combined great mathematical insight with the writing of a book,  Statistical Methods for Research Workers , that showed us lesser mortals how to go about designing and analyzing experiments in a proper manner without worrying us about how these methods worked. Unfortunately for proper mathematicians, he was less good in explaining in his other publications how he derived his methods, and in some cases I gather he never published any derivation. However his unpublished papers show he wasn't making it all up, indeed as late as the 1970s those who examined his unpublished work learned new insights. Gradually other math types filled in or found on their own the detailed proofs.  The other candidate for worlds greatest statistician would be A. N. Kolmogorov, who put probability on a firm mathematical foundation (among many other things). As this work is a necessary condition for statistical application to be valid, this is very important. He was also an important developer of statistical methods. Kolomogorov was a Soviet citizen of astonishingly wide interests (he spent a good deal of time teaching gifted children at a special Moscow school), and great kindness.  The third most important statistician would probably be Jerzy Neyman, a man of Polish antecedents who spent much of his career in the United States. Neyman, along with Egon Pearson (Karl's son) was the developer of the now ubiqutious notion of hypothesis testing. Neyman also developed the concept of a confidence interval. In hypothesis testing you determine how often an experimental outcome, called the null hypothesis, would occur do to chance alone. If this probability is below a small but arbitrary value, one concludes that the null hypothesis is rejected, and that the alternative hypothesis is correct. An example of confidence intervals is when a poll's results state that the president's approval rate is 45%, plus or minus 3%, with 95% confidence. Both of these ideas are controversial as well as very commonly used, in part because their meaning in application (the math is perfectly rigorous)becomes less clear the more you examine them.  Besides the greats, the author covers many other people (including John Tukey, who probably should be included in the list of greats), who made important contributions to statistics. He also covers other techniques than the ones I mentioned above, such as experimental design, non-parametric statistics, computer intensive methods such as the bootstrap, and Bayesian statistics.  The author also brings up the philosophical matters that continue to bedevil statistics, such as the meaning of a probability. The most common approach is the frequentist school, in which a probability is the fraction of total outcomes in which a particular outcome (say winning the lottery divided by the number of tickets you've bought) is observed. There are difficulties with this approach, as there are with alternative Bayesian approaches. I think the author is mistaken in his apparent belief that issue is primarily limited to applications of statistics; I would says that it is problem with all forms of knowledge which depend to some extent on induction, the drawing of conclusions from necessarily limited numbers of experiences.  The book includes a bibliography, including a most helpful annotated section of recommended books that are light on the math. There is also a chronology of developments in statistics.  I enjoyed the book. I found some of the discussions of statistical issues unclear, which I attribute to the author's unwillingness to introduce any mathematical notation in order to avoid scaring off readers. I think a little math at the level of simple algebra, possibly separated from the main text in separate boxes so as not to disturb the flow of the narrative, would have been helpful in this regard. "

It is an interesting read about the characters behind many of the most widely used statistical methods. As with most people in the world, the statisticians who built the foundation for modern stats were far from perfect. They fought with each other over statistical methods and theory and had minor and major character flaws (e.g., supporting Eugenics). "

This is exactly what I felt was missing in my undergraduate studies, an introductory course to Statistics, not the body of mathematical abstractions and methodologies, but the people that made it into the wild, all-encompassing discipline that it is today. Weird to think that it is only now that I'm associating a face, a life, to the names that I continuously had to deal with in my undergraduate years and now while I approach the end of my masters. Neyman being afraid of Fisher's criticisms, Egon Pearson establishing his own journal for fear of angering his father Karl by working with Neyman on Fisher's idea of the likelihood function and developing the theory of hypothesis testing. Fisher moving from being the lowly genius marked by its then tyrant Karl Pearson into being its own feared but at the same time revered tyrant.I did find problems in Salsburg's unwillingness to invoke even a single line of mathematical complexity into the book, which results in him trailing off into other topics just when his discussion of a particular development hits full stride. But alas, this is a book written for the nonmathematicians, and to that end, certain tradeoffs must be made. It certainly did not affect my enjoyment of the book. A week from starting it and I come out with a relived appreciation for the field I've committed myself into, and to the men and women who built its foundations.

242,0805071342,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38280411-john-fuller,2," A seemingly thorough overview of the history of statistics and the various people in it, but there are so many names and characters whizzing by that sometimes the statistics itself is left behind. There are several times where the author mentions an important theory or development, only to give it the barest explanation, or none at all. Understandably this is not a book about statistics itself, and to attempt to satisfactorily explain and prove the broad collection of ideas within it would likely require multiple volumes.  The book at its best in the beginning, before branching off in every which way, when examining the very beginning of the field, with Gosset and Pearson and Fisher. As it continues, and more and more characters are introduced, it becomes difficult to keep track of the landscape, or of a strong logical flow to the arrangement of chapters. For a person already familiar with some of the history of statistics or with the theory itself this may be fine, but for a relative neophytes like myself it makes for a more difficult read.  Despite its flaws, the book is still interesting and coherent enough to be worth the read, though some later chapters are skippable. "

Mr. Salsburg is very careful to not cross the line between giving details and being too technical, so the concepts and ideas are shown in great detail but without mathematics, what makes possible a fluid and smooth reading.He also emphasizes that, although many famous names are males statisticians, a lot of women has contributed and headed the revolution in Statistics, so at least some chapters of the book are dedicated to these women.Much more than simply compiling a lot of historical information, the author goes further and provides insights into the philosophical aspects of Statistics, generating interesting and delightful discussions, inciting the reader to think about this.I`ve finished the book with some better grasp of what statistics and probability can bring and mean into our lives and put it into my (physical) shelf with a will to study and dive into these subjects."
244,0805071342,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3265556-converse,3," This book is an informal history of the development of statistics in the 20th century. The author, who was a statistician in the pharmaceutical industry, had meant many of the statisticians whose work he discusses. It is not a mathematical book, in the sense that not a line of algebra is to be found in it.  The author begins with Karl Pearson in Britain at the begining of the twentieth century, when he took over Francis Galton (cousin of Charles Darwin, promoter of the use of fingerprints in identification, and eugenicist) biometrical (measuring people) laboratory in London. Pearson believed that the aim of science, in a world where the objects of study show ubiquitous numerical variation in the measurement of any trait you care to mention, should be the determination of the smaller number of parameters (numbers like the average, the standard deviation, plus some more obscure ones like symmetry and kurtosis) that describe the distribution of variability of a trait. Pearson's importance was greatly inhanced by his ediotrial control over an important scientific journal, Biometrika  In this journal, Pearson early on published the work of William Gosset, the developer of a most useful statisticial test called the t test, with which one can determine how likely it is that two different samples with different means are in fact different. Gosset had to published under a pen name because his employer, the Guiness brewery, forbade its employees to publish after an unfortunate incident when a brewer gave out some trade secrets.  The next great figure, definitely of the most important statisticians, possibly the most important, and scientists of the 20th century was R. A. Fisher. Fisher developed most of the statistical techniques, such as analysis of variance, that I used 80 years later to analyze, interpret, and design experiments. Fisher combined great mathematical insight with the writing of a book,  Statistical Methods for Research Workers , that showed us lesser mortals how to go about designing and analyzing experiments in a proper manner without worrying us about how these methods worked. Unfortunately for proper mathematicians, he was less good in explaining in his other publications how he derived his methods, and in some cases I gather he never published any derivation. However his unpublished papers show he wasn't making it all up, indeed as late as the 1970s those who examined his unpublished work learned new insights. Gradually other math types filled in or found on their own the detailed proofs.  The other candidate for worlds greatest statistician would be A. N. Kolmogorov, who put probability on a firm mathematical foundation (among many other things). As this work is a necessary condition for statistical application to be valid, this is very important. He was also an important developer of statistical methods. Kolomogorov was a Soviet citizen of astonishingly wide interests (he spent a good deal of time teaching gifted children at a special Moscow school), and great kindness.  The third most important statistician would probably be Jerzy Neyman, a man of Polish antecedents who spent much of his career in the United States. Neyman, along with Egon Pearson (Karl's son) was the developer of the now ubiqutious notion of hypothesis testing. Neyman also developed the concept of a confidence interval. In hypothesis testing you determine how often an experimental outcome, called the null hypothesis, would occur do to chance alone. If this probability is below a small but arbitrary value, one concludes that the null hypothesis is rejected, and that the alternative hypothesis is correct. An example of confidence intervals is when a poll's results state that the president's approval rate is 45%, plus or minus 3%, with 95% confidence. Both of these ideas are controversial as well as very commonly used, in part because their meaning in application (the math is perfectly rigorous)becomes less clear the more you examine them.  Besides the greats, the author covers many other people (including John Tukey, who probably should be included in the list of greats), who made important contributions to statistics. He also covers other techniques than the ones I mentioned above, such as experimental design, non-parametric statistics, computer intensive methods such as the bootstrap, and Bayesian statistics.  The author also brings up the philosophical matters that continue to bedevil statistics, such as the meaning of a probability. The most common approach is the frequentist school, in which a probability is the fraction of total outcomes in which a particular outcome (say winning the lottery divided by the number of tickets you've bought) is observed. There are difficulties with this approach, as there are with alternative Bayesian approaches. I think the author is mistaken in his apparent belief that issue is primarily limited to applications of statistics; I would says that it is problem with all forms of knowledge which depend to some extent on induction, the drawing of conclusions from necessarily limited numbers of experiences.  The book includes a bibliography, including a most helpful annotated section of recommended books that are light on the math. There is also a chronology of developments in statistics.  I enjoyed the book. I found some of the discussions of statistical issues unclear, which I attribute to the author's unwillingness to introduce any mathematical notation in order to avoid scaring off readers. I think a little math at the level of simple algebra, possibly separated from the main text in separate boxes so as not to disturb the flow of the narrative, would have been helpful in this regard. "
245,0805071342,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75572772-tyler-varisco,5,"This book is a wonderful history of statistics. Salsburg does an excellent job of providing a truly human history of the names and methods we have all become so familiar with. This is not, however, a book of mathematical theory. Still, in his conclusion, Salsburg provides a brief overview of the epistemological problems associated with our interpretation of probability, enough so to make me think more about how I sling around P values as a researcher. More than anything, this book made me appreciate how hard it once was to actually calculate statistics, something that computers have certainly made us take for granted. This book should be required reading for first year graduate students in the physical and life sciences. "

It is rather a story of statistical revolution as it as happening from its active participant and practitioner who helped to form its trajectory. The book is easy to read and entertaining. I personally enjoyed the chapters on problem solving, i.e. those that described how certain statistical procedures were developed in response to concrete problems one faced (aka Fisher's ANOVA and his crop studies, Student's t-test and his brewing problem, Chester Bliss's probit model as an answer to toxicology problem, etc)"

I've developed a pretty high tolerance for the prosaic, however, so no promises.Recommended audience: students of statistics who want to know more about their heroes; people like me who will pick up anything from the ""light science"" shelf in the library and, once committed, stick with it out of pride, or for the heck of it.Favorite fact: (spoiler alert) Some of the great advances in modern statistics were made on behalf of the Guinness brewery, in their continuing effort to improve and maintain the consistency of their tasty, tasty beverage."
272,0805071342,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38280411-john-fuller,2," A seemingly thorough overview of the history of statistics and the various people in it, but there are so many names and characters whizzing by that sometimes the statistics itself is left behind. There are several times where the author mentions an important theory or development, only to give it the barest explanation, or none at all. Understandably this is not a book about statistics itself, and to attempt to satisfactorily explain and prove the broad collection of ideas within it would likely require multiple volumes.  The book at its best in the beginning, before branching off in every which way, when examining the very beginning of the field, with Gosset and Pearson and Fisher. As it continues, and more and more characters are introduced, it becomes difficult to keep track of the landscape, or of a strong logical flow to the arrangement of chapters. For a person already familiar with some of the history of statistics or with the theory itself this may be fine, but for a relative neophytes like myself it makes for a more difficult read.  Despite its flaws, the book is still interesting and coherent enough to be worth the read, though some later chapters are skippable. "
273,0805071342,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52508910-lu-s-caparroz,5,"The author communicates extremely well given his audience and goals. A wonderful review of the development of Statistics in the 20th century as a consolidated and respected field of knowledge is given. Mr. Salsburg is very careful to not cross the line between giving details and being too technical, so the concepts and ideas are shown in great detail but without mathematics, what makes possible a fluid and smooth reading.He also emphasizes that, although many famous names are males statisticians, a lot of women has contributed and headed the revolution in Statistics, so at least some chapters of the book are dedicated to these women.Much more than simply compiling a lot of historical information, the author goes further and provides insights into the philosophical aspects of Statistics, generating interesting and delightful discussions, inciting the reader to think about this.I`ve finished the book with some better grasp of what statistics and probability can bring and mean into our lives and put it into my (physical) shelf with a will to study and dive into these subjects."
274,0805071342,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3265556-converse,3," This book is an informal history of the development of statistics in the 20th century. The author, who was a statistician in the pharmaceutical industry, had meant many of the statisticians whose work he discusses. It is not a mathematical book, in the sense that not a line of algebra is to be found in it.  The author begins with Karl Pearson in Britain at the begining of the twentieth century, when he took over Francis Galton (cousin of Charles Darwin, promoter of the use of fingerprints in identification, and eugenicist) biometrical (measuring people) laboratory in London. Pearson believed that the aim of science, in a world where the objects of study show ubiquitous numerical variation in the measurement of any trait you care to mention, should be the determination of the smaller number of parameters (numbers like the average, the standard deviation, plus some more obscure ones like symmetry and kurtosis) that describe the distribution of variability of a trait. Pearson's importance was greatly inhanced by his ediotrial control over an important scientific journal, Biometrika  In this journal, Pearson early on published the work of William Gosset, the developer of a most useful statisticial test called the t test, with which one can determine how likely it is that two different samples with different means are in fact different. Gosset had to published under a pen name because his employer, the Guiness brewery, forbade its employees to publish after an unfortunate incident when a brewer gave out some trade secrets.  The next great figure, definitely of the most important statisticians, possibly the most important, and scientists of the 20th century was R. A. Fisher. Fisher developed most of the statistical techniques, such as analysis of variance, that I used 80 years later to analyze, interpret, and design experiments. Fisher combined great mathematical insight with the writing of a book,  Statistical Methods for Research Workers , that showed us lesser mortals how to go about designing and analyzing experiments in a proper manner without worrying us about how these methods worked. Unfortunately for proper mathematicians, he was less good in explaining in his other publications how he derived his methods, and in some cases I gather he never published any derivation. However his unpublished papers show he wasn't making it all up, indeed as late as the 1970s those who examined his unpublished work learned new insights. Gradually other math types filled in or found on their own the detailed proofs.  The other candidate for worlds greatest statistician would be A. N. Kolmogorov, who put probability on a firm mathematical foundation (among many other things). As this work is a necessary condition for statistical application to be valid, this is very important. He was also an important developer of statistical methods. Kolomogorov was a Soviet citizen of astonishingly wide interests (he spent a good deal of time teaching gifted children at a special Moscow school), and great kindness.  The third most important statistician would probably be Jerzy Neyman, a man of Polish antecedents who spent much of his career in the United States. Neyman, along with Egon Pearson (Karl's son) was the developer of the now ubiqutious notion of hypothesis testing. Neyman also developed the concept of a confidence interval. In hypothesis testing you determine how often an experimental outcome, called the null hypothesis, would occur do to chance alone. If this probability is below a small but arbitrary value, one concludes that the null hypothesis is rejected, and that the alternative hypothesis is correct. An example of confidence intervals is when a poll's results state that the president's approval rate is 45%, plus or minus 3%, with 95% confidence. Both of these ideas are controversial as well as very commonly used, in part because their meaning in application (the math is perfectly rigorous)becomes less clear the more you examine them.  Besides the greats, the author covers many other people (including John Tukey, who probably should be included in the list of greats), who made important contributions to statistics. He also covers other techniques than the ones I mentioned above, such as experimental design, non-parametric statistics, computer intensive methods such as the bootstrap, and Bayesian statistics.  The author also brings up the philosophical matters that continue to bedevil statistics, such as the meaning of a probability. The most common approach is the frequentist school, in which a probability is the fraction of total outcomes in which a particular outcome (say winning the lottery divided by the number of tickets you've bought) is observed. There are difficulties with this approach, as there are with alternative Bayesian approaches. I think the author is mistaken in his apparent belief that issue is primarily limited to applications of statistics; I would says that it is problem with all forms of knowledge which depend to some extent on induction, the drawing of conclusions from necessarily limited numbers of experiences.  The book includes a bibliography, including a most helpful annotated section of recommended books that are light on the math. There is also a chronology of developments in statistics.  I enjoyed the book. I found some of the discussions of statistical issues unclear, which I attribute to the author's unwillingness to introduce any mathematical notation in order to avoid scaring off readers. I think a little math at the level of simple algebra, possibly separated from the main text in separate boxes so as not to disturb the flow of the narrative, would have been helpful in this regard. "
275,0805071342,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75572772-tyler-varisco,5,"This book is a wonderful history of statistics. Salsburg does an excellent job of providing a truly human history of the names and methods we have all become so familiar with. This is not, however, a book of mathematical theory. Still, in his conclusion, Salsburg provides a brief overview of the epistemological problems associated with our interpretation of probability, enough so to make me think more about how I sling around P values as a researcher. More than anything, this book made me appreciate how hard it once was to actually calculate statistics, something that computers have certainly made us take for granted. This book should be required reading for first year graduate students in the physical and life sciences. "
276,0805071342,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59162734-katerina-bosko,4,"If you expect a solid overview about the history of statistics, this book is not for you. It's definitely not academic/encyclopedic. Salsburg provides a lot of anecdotes from his personal encounters with prominent statisticians. It is rather a story of statistical revolution as it as happening from its active participant and practitioner who helped to form its trajectory. The book is easy to read and entertaining. I personally enjoyed the chapters on problem solving, i.e. those that described how certain statistical procedures were developed in response to concrete problems one faced (aka Fisher's ANOVA and his crop studies, Student's t-test and his brewing problem, Chester Bliss's probit model as an answer to toxicology problem, etc)"
277,0805071342,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73873711-miguel-angel,5,"A great book that takes you in a historical and biographical tour, from Pearson's and his skew distributions to Tukey's and his bootstraps (1895 -2000's), in a very fluid, interesting and easy to grasp manner. The final remarks of the book are for me the intellectually most important part of the book. As makes clear the importance of statistics in our every day but remark the problems that statistics face in a philosophical and ultimately scientifical manner.Notes: The book does not go deep into mathematical explanations but requires a deep interest and basic knowledge of statistics from the reader."
278,0805071342,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1236862-simon,3,"The Lady Tasting Tea is an entertaining history of mathematical statistics from its beginnings with the work of Karl Pearson to about the late eighties. More a collection of vignettes about different statisticians than a comprehensive history, the book has its best moments in the anecdotal description of its subjects, often drawing from Salsburg's own experience with them. While the book is written for non-experts, I am wondering how much a reader without a background in statistics will understand: The explanations are often more allusions to than descriptions of the innovations discussed. Having an interest in the field, though, the book humanises a lot of the great names in statistics."
279,0805071342,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4807768-megan,4,"Honestly, I am lukewarm on this book. It was interesting, and the subject matter is so impactful, I wanted to love it.However, I found it lacking both in math (some times you just need math - i get that the author wanted to make it accessible to everyone, but, sometimes the concepts just weren't clear enough without), and in narrative structure. The book jumped around a little bit, and occasionally it was challenging to follow a thread.The author's love for the subject matter and the subjects was quite clear, though."
280,0805071342,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7820883-susan,4,"Impressively straight forward and fast read considering the subject matter. This book helped put a lot of the common methods we use in context & perspective. (I wonder if my students would find stats more interesting / understandable if I made them all read this book....) Would have like a bit more material on the women / POC instead of just a passing mention or namedrop, but not bad considering the author did his dissertation before I was born. "
281,0805071342,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16437811-jenine-kinne,4,"I've read this book a few times now since I require it for my graduate students in statistics. It is an interesting read about the characters behind many of the most widely used statistical methods. As with most people in the world, the statisticians who built the foundation for modern stats were far from perfect. They fought with each other over statistical methods and theory and had minor and major character flaws (e.g., supporting Eugenics). "
282,0805071342,http://goodreads.com/user/show/650906-guillermo-duran,5,One of the few books written for the general audience about the history and philosophy of statistics.

Because it was reading it over a long period of time (it was my left in the car book), I kept forgetting what happened in earlier chapters so I'm still not sure I understand much of what he was talking about. While I was reading the early chapters it made sense. I think I may borrow some or maybe one book from the bibliography. "
284,0805071342,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1894482-ilana-diamant,3,"Interesting story of Statistics, but the writing was boring at most parts: paragraphs seemed to have a similar structure: introduce a man and say 1-2 sentences to try to make him memorable. Then describe a statistical phenomenon in clear but soporific terms. If there had been more colorful stories about the scientists, the book would have been more fun to read (and memorable)."
285,0805071342,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5777523-jami,4,"This was a good overview of the developments in statistics. I learned some things and got the most part it was easy to follow. You definitely need an understanding of statistics though as it doesn't teach you that; it is more a history of the field. It was interesting to read that not all of the great minds agree on certain things, which makes sense given the abstract nature of the formulas."

I like it if it activates me to read more, think about or even start using it in my day to day life. With all the big data hype and all the hacks with their computer models this brought me back to real life. I am more then the Amazon Algorithm or some Facebook code. And I am not going to let them spoil my fun with numbers."
