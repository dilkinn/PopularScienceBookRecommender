0,0387914951,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6000443-j-p,4,"This book is a well written & straightforward allegory for an introduction to the basics of Quantum Physics/Mechanics. I think it's helpful to understand at least a little about the subject because if you're interested in books written about the Universe, different aspects of this topic tend to come up fairly often. It is very odd because of the way things work in such a counter-intuitive manner, yet experimentation agrees with it's predictions. It goes into protons, electrons, quarks, spin, Pauli Exclusion Principle, Heisenberg Uncertainty principle & much more. It explains these concepts in a very straightforward manner which is made very easy with the use of the allegory. I recommend it for anyone who is interested in the subject & needs a good starting point."

2,0387914951,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5237347-noha,2,I'm not going to lie and give a higher ranking to look smart ... I almost understood the first half of the book only 
3,0387914951,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24011982-cynda,5,"Twenty years ago I spent time at the coffeeshop with a group of medical folk. We used to talk about metaphysics, and they used to talk about quantum physics. I wish I had known about this book then.Yet I am glad to have read this book now or anyway. I have enjoyed the curiosity of Alice as she has led me into a world of which I have vague high school memories of and into areas I did not know about the quarks and gluons. Sure I have seen images and have read a thing or two. But fear limited me from retaining any knowledge. This allegory helps me to remember and to add information to my mental file.Because high school was 4 decades ago and because I am only now being introduced to quarks, I will be rereading in another couple of years.Because I appreciate the allegorical teaching style, I will read at least one more of Robert Gilmore's allegories: Scrooge's Cryptic Carol: Visions of Energy, Time, and Quantum Nature. I think it will be the most accessible to me."
4,0387914951,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8877868-ron-btdtbttsawio,2,I made it about 30% into this book before I bailed. It's more of a novelty book and doesn't really teach the concepts of quantum physics very well.
5,0387914951,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4647185-teo,2,"I went into this book under the impression that Robert Gilmore would use Alice as a medium to teach readers about quantum physics. I was hoping that this would read more like a novel, rather than a textbook. Unfortunately, this is not the case.Instead, Gilmore is - quite literally - teaching you. He is the professor. You are the student sitting in a classroom.The word 'allegory' is defined as ""expression by means of symbolic fictional figures and actions of truths or generalizations about human existence"". In ""Alice in Quantumland"", our heroine goes from place to place, where she meets characters who give her actual lessons in quantum physics.""Hello, I am an Electron. Let me tell you something about myself."" Begin lesson. The 'narrative' is even interrupted by actual block-quotes which go deeper into the lessons, and also end-of-chapter notes for additional lesson-y stuff.Basically, add the sentence ""The Quantum Mechanic said:"" before any quantum physics textbook and you get ""Alice in Quantumland"". Not exactly the allegory I was hoping for, honestly.Lesson after lesson after lesson dryly presented by so called characters such as the Photon, the Electron, the Classic Mechanic, the Quantum Mechanic"", etc. I say, so called, because there are no actual literary characters in this work; there is no plot; there is nothing besides physics lessons.Granted, Gilmore does offer some neat scenes that do make some aspects of the whole quantum jumble more understandable to the average reader. It's not enough, however. Myself, I do have an amateur interest for all this physics stuff, but still this book was pretty tedious to finish.It seems like a lot wasted potential, and that something really remarkable could've been done with this idea. Too bad. To conclude, as Alice herself comments in the last line of the book: ""Boring."" Can't recommend it."
6,0387914951,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1632951-pablo-bley,5,"By adapting Lewis Carroll's well known story ""Alice in Wonderland"", physicist Robert Gilmore offers an entertaining and educational look at the theoretical framework of Physics-Quantum Mechanics which seems to provide the most accurate explanations of the way things are in the physical world. The story takes us to Quantumland, where Alice encounters a world of electrons and photons, wave functions, the Pauli Principle and the Uncertainty Principle. Along the way, Alice meets Schrödinger's cat, an emperor, a little mermaid and an ugly duckling, all of whom have something to tell her about quantum physics. It's accessible, yet in-depth, with scientific definitions, and fun illustrations that help the reader to imagine very complex concepts. “Throughout the narrative you will find many statements that are obviously nonsensical and quite at variance with common sense. For the most part these are true.”― Robert Gilmore, Alice in Quantumland: An Allegory of Quantum Physics "
7,0387914951,http://goodreads.com/user/show/623055-allen,4,"As the subtitle says, this is an allegory of quantum physics. We find Alice on a dull, rainy day as she watches uninteresting TV programs which leads her to daydream about doing something interesting. As Alice continues watching the TV screen becomes fuzzy and she finds herself being pulled inside, tumbling headlong into a new world - a world where electrons always bounce and wiggle so that they can remain small, where rabbits run headlong at locked doors and pass through unharmed (eventually), where no matter what path Alice takes, she always ends up where she is supposed to be. This is Quantum World, the world that we live in, the world that would make our heads spin if we could see into the atom. The book is full of ""color""ful and ""quark""y characters and was a lot of fun to read. I recommend it to imaginative science geeks."
8,0387914951,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5115519-mohamed-ibrahim,4,"the amazing story when we put it in this strange world , the quantum world it all about real world magic , small scale is real and is not just an imagination like what in the original Alice story you will feel enjoyed with every line of this book I have and objection only about over simplification of some points "
9,0387914951,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56378248-julie,3,This is an allegorical book that is supposed to help teach you the different aspects of quantam mechanics by following Alice around as she encounters the different theories. This got very high marks but this is not for everyone. I had taken physics many decades ago but had lost that knowledge since it was never my major field of study. I think someone studying beginning quantum physics now would benefit from reading this cleverly written and illustrated book.

11,0387914951,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53657285-deb-pate,1,I understood more about quantum mechanics before I read the convoluted allegory. Now I am as confused as Alice was throughout this book.

The topic being something of Himalayan proportions,the presentation was done in an interesting way. At few places,I felt like I was reading Chinese but the rest was really interesting.. The attempt to find humor in subatomic interactions is laudable. I especially liked the introduction of nucleus as the master behind everything,just like some underground mafia don. And Castle Rutherford and Mendeleev Pier,that was perfect. As a whole,this book is just perfect for getting one interested in quantum physics. "
13,0387914951,http://goodreads.com/user/show/655723-nick-black,2,"Manages to take two of my favorite things ( Alice in Wonderland and quantum physics) and be insipid about both. Way to go, chief!"

Many of the principles explored in this book, I have studied in high-school - Pauli's exclusion principle, Heisenberg uncertainty, the double-slit experiments, etc. And believe me, my high school texts were far easier to understand than this book. It was so needlessly convoluted, I almost gave up on it - but it slotted in to my challenge categories and was a (mercifully) short read, so I plodded on. I wouldn't recommend plodding on - read the first chapter; if the style works for you, good for you; if not, save yourself the agony and move on to a more ""mathematical"" book on quantum physics. Maths is a hell lot easier than reading the forced analogies of Alice in Quantumland.Read for the challenge prompts -Member's Task Reading Challenge - Read a book about quantum physics or about nuclear physics.PopSugar 2018 -An allegory"
16,0387914951,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33291876-isabelle-nine-tale-vixen,0,"DNF @ 47%Honestly, I've never particularly liked physics — even introductory classical physics gave me a headache; molecular orbital theory was one of my constant tripping points in chemistry. And it felt like 90% of this book was straight-up physics lecture, with topics bridged by bits of story (that also illustrated physics concepts), and just a handful of scenes for comic relief and/or nods to the original Alice and Wonderland (several of which felt contrived). So it's very dry, and very much not my cup of tea.Though I had enough background knowledge to nod along for the first couple of chapters, when they start really getting into the quantum stuff I was beyond confused. The analogies (and allusions) were cute but I didn't find them especially elucidatory."
17,0387914951,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72774025-lucas-alegre,3,"The idea of the book is very good, however, while many topics are well explained, others are much more easy to be understood by a quick google search than by the allegories presented in the Alice's journey. I recommend the book for those who want a more entertainment introduction to Quantum Physics, even that it is necessary to take a look at a real physics material in order to really understand some of the fundamental concepts."
18,0387914951,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40208745-reenah,4,"3.5 stars. I really liked the first 7 of 10 chapters. A really nice way of introducing the basic principles of quantum physics. The last 3 chapters were not so good, though. The weird humour makes it really hard to understand the principles that are meant to be conveyed (e.g. a Quark with a weird Italian accent). For the last 3 chapters it was easier reading the small explanatory boxes that relate Alice' experiences to ""actual"" physics. "
19,0387914951,http://goodreads.com/user/show/103541253-joaqu-n-almansa,2,"A good idea but poorly developed. The use of Lewis Carroll's character is a mere introduction to a pure theory lesson and sometimes even hinders the explanation of the concepts. To understand the book, you need some previous familiarity with quantum physics. Otherwise you'll get lost quickly and the supposed allegories won't help you. "
20,0387914951,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3889200-cat,3,"This was almost very good in some points, and did explain parts of quantum physics in an easy way, with lovely imagery that helped me to understand the concepts. However, many parts were pretty hard going, where Alice was merely a student while she was lectured with traditional textbook-like speech. "
21,0387914951,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71222118-jahangir-khanzada,4,"Alice in the quantum land is a very good read, it is like a science book written so well in a type of a fiction way that you enjoy a lot reading it , and the most important thing you get the concept of the typical quantum topics very well in your mind."
22,0387914951,http://goodreads.com/user/show/109014442-dimitra,4,"I read it when I was 14. It was a gift from my Physics professor because at that time I was very curious about these issues, and indeed it was an interesting and easy to follow presentation of the quantum theory."

28,0387914951,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65405328-georgia,4,"Robert Gilmore does a wonderful job explaining basic quantum physics through Alice 's famous journey in wonderland in such an efficient way, even those with no theoretical background such as myself can grasp its basic principles , while also keeping the story itself fun and interesting.. Even though years have past since I first read it, I often find myself processing any information about quantum physics I might hear through one of Alice's little adventures... I 'll definitely check this book again in the future.."
29,0387914951,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33765699-lavinia,4,"Full disclosure: I took two years of physics, one in high school and one in college, so none of the information was exactly new (though I haven't taken enough to comment on the correctness or datedness of the material). Even from this perspective, though, the book's greatest flaw is having little to no understanding of what kinds of illustrations readers might find useful. The story takes Alice, a late 20th-century schoolgirl, through several of the best-known thought experiments in quantum physics without benefit of diagrams or pictures. This is especially frustrating considering that there are about a dozen sketches of interesting-looking characters. Simple diagrams done in a different style, a la the chess problems in Through the Looking-Glass, would have been sufficient.That said, this book is ambitious and in my opinion does fulfill its goals of providing a primer for a very unintuitive field. However, it does the legacy of Alice in Wonderland a disservice (which I haven't factored into my rating) in that it takes the Alice without providing a Wonderland. The Quantumland of the title is a string of loosely related scenarios from enthusiastic physics textbooks linked by in-story geographical location. The original Alice in Wonderland continues to captivate young readers 150 years after its publication because it is abstract enough in the presentation of adult ideas to provide an interesting world and an action-packed plot. Kids can take the logic puzzles and symbolism at face value to enrich the story without becoming confused. Using the Alice framework to present an overt scientific lecture entirely misses the point.On the other hand, I can't think of a popular children's story that allows for antics as weird as those presented in this book. The generic kids-hanging-out science books I read as a child were boring, and it is a little more fun to think of the quantum mechanics thought constructs as the weird characters of Wonderland. The ""allegory"" part of the title is more accurate than it sounds: it's a sin in science to anthropomorphize too much because appending human motives and scenarios to non-sentient objects destroys the inhuman dynamics of reality. Bringing the electrons and photons to the forefront as characters seems too overt to fit the ""allegory"" label, but I think it's necessary to draw kids' attention and is actually a deeper level of metaphor than it seems. The book's end-of-chapter notes may turn kids off with their wordiness, but I actually advise readers to skip them entirely and read the book with Wikipedia or Google close at hand."
30,0387914951,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23894830-sophia-f,4,"This phenomenal combination of familiar and complex concepts had one of the most remarkable formats that I have read. I knew literally nothing about quantum physics before, (other than the name itself,) but now I have the ability to say that I can conceptualize portions of the basics. It was intriguing, which helped dim the confusing aspects of the entire book. I have my physics teacher to thank for lending me his book. I had never heard of this allegory before, and I don't think I ever would have come across it if he hadn't introduced me to it. Everyone who loves learning should read it. I know that I will probably never gain a deeper understanding of quantum physics, but that didn't change how fascinated I was with Quantumland. A love for learning will continue to grow when fed with knowledge. This book was more proof that learning about complicated ideas can still be fun, even when you're struggling to fully comprehend them. The only reason I don't give this book a five-star rating is because of the lacking of clear descriptions. It was great for vague, general ideas. Examples and end-of-chapter notes were provided to help what was described. I have no idea what else Robert Gilmore could have done to clarify for what was written about, so I blame my confusion solely on myself. Otherwise, I was impressed with his ability to incorporate two extremely different notions in such a manner. "
31,0387914951,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43807684-g-c-neff,4,"This is a very interesting book, although the complex theories can cause a dizzy feeling. The premise appears to be that if you're wanting to go to a restaurant in town, while you're taking one route, you're also taking every other route at the same time. Then when you order from the menu, you're ordering not just one item but are also ordering everything else. Confusing, but fascinating.The only reason I didn't rate the book a five-star is that I have heard that the equation used to prove quantum physics had to be changed by adding in a part that was incorrect. To me, this causes concern that the theories are still just that, theories, and shouldn't be taken as fact. At least, I'm certain that my high-school physics teacher would have marked such an equation incorrect if I had submitted it to her."
32,0387914951,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26259694-tauras,5,"One of the best books about science I have ever read.Alice in Quantumland is an allegory about quantum physics. A little girl named Alice sits in her room a little bit bored and then something strange happens - she appears to be as small as an electron.And so she went on this scientific adventure. It is an interesting book trying to explain how quantum principles are not intuitive and differ from what we see in our daily lives. Uncertainty, Pauli exclusion, virtual reality and many other quantum phenomena were explain in this book. After finishing the last page my head started to spin around trying to truly grasp these concepts. Overall, quite a nice interesting introduction into my 2nd year Physics. :)"

It's hard to believe the world works this way and the findings bring about questions on the nature of reality. The topic is very complex and this book was the perfect starting point. One feature I really liked was that as the author shares information, he has a separate box calling out the same point in a different way. I found this to be very helpful given the complexity of the material being shared. I highly recommend this book and then suggest following up with Gribbin's In Search of Schrödinger's Cat: Quantum Physics and Reality I guarantee you'll be shocked if you aren't familiar with the science."

It had some great allegories for how some of the stuff in quantum worked, but other times you were still sitting there and scratching your head trying to figure out how that's supposed to work. Then you just kind of have to accept it [like of like faith:], and faith and science are just kind of hard to mix in my mind. Probably a better read for those who like allegories (or understand them better then me) or have a better understanding of physics then me. It is a good read to learn more about quantum- just be forewarned- it's confusing stuff!"

Initially, it sound like a good thing because quantum theory resists understanding that a fable might be the right thing. But it still leaves me wondering, what do these stories and examples represent? I liked much better Richard Feynman's book on QED. He described a few experiments and how the scientists worked up a theory that fit the phenomenon."
37,0387914951,http://goodreads.com/user/show/728995-marie,2,"It's not really a teaching book. I had hoped it would make some concepts clearer, but whenever I read about a concept I was fuzzy on to begin with, I remained fuzzy on it. This book is much more for those who delight in puns about esoteric subjects. Every page has at least one silly math pun. I suppose the bit on the quarks made sense to me - I 'get' now why quarks come in 3 or 2. But... I think I could have gotten it faster without the references to the Marx brothers."

I really, really wanted to like this more. I now understand a lot more about quantum physics but not as much as I thought I would. Because even with the attempted allegory, this still felt like a textbook. It's just a textbook narrated by atoms. I think it could have and should have been less of an information overload. "

The chapters in the book are structured in an independent format. You can read a chapter and then leave it for sometime before coming back to read the next chapter (eventually).

I would have appreciated more thorough explanations in the footnotes, as well as for the end-of-chapter notes to be more cohesive with the points at which they were referenced. I feel this would be more entertaining to someone more educated than a first-year physics student, but probably too basic for that level of comprehension. Good attempt at entertaining while educating. "

50,0387914951,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2572352-sheila,5, I studied basic physics when in high school and college but only barely touched on quantum physics. By reading this allegory of Alice in Wonderland and I have more of an understanding of the wonders of quantum theory. It was informative as well as entertaining. 
51,0387914951,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4911875-sarah,4,"This was probably a very good medium to discuss quantum physics. I still have no idea what the heck it's all about, but just accepting that things are crazy and don't make sense in the ""classical world"" is helpful."
52,0387914951,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28569697-creativezen,4,"Really original, generally good explanations of some complicated concepts, and particularly liked the illustrations. Felt it had a bit of an abrupt ending but I'll definitely want to re-read it at some point. "
53,0387914951,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5323289-rirtzi,3,Picked this up in a tiny charity shop in South London; I found the premise compelling but unfortunately the execution didn't quite live up. I liked it but I would only recommend it because of its quirkiness.
54,0387914951,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5999188-britt,4,"A fun, informative introduction to quantum mechanics. Gilmore also introduces other schools of thought on quantum theory, which I was grateful for. I never thought I would find particle physics interesting!"
55,0387914951,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7128569-amandee,1,"If you're a scientist stay away from this book. I was hoping it would be more like Flatland, but it wasn't. The comparisons are too far fetched to surmount to describe what quantum mechanics really is."
56,0387914951,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46180078-the-scientist,0,"I really enjoyed the pace, complexities explained in quite an interesting manner. The insights were highly easy to understand. It took me a while to read though, not a good book for when you're lightheaded."
57,0387914951,http://goodreads.com/user/show/106994438-anndromeda-just-book-updates-for-a-time,4,"Extremely interesting!! The mysteries of the universe have always captivated me, and quantum physics has to be one of the most bizarre realms. This helped me get a better grasp of the concepts, while being fun to read!"
58,0387914951,http://goodreads.com/user/show/358772-lorelei,5,Still great after all these years. ;-)
59,0387914951,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2029618-jodi,4,Wacky but good look at quantum physics.
