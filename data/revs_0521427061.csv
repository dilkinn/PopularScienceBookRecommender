0,0521427061,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17744555-blackoxford,5,"A Serious Business of TasteThe dominant theme of A Mathematician’s Apology, established from the first page, is one of aesthetics. Aesthetics, the study of what is inherently important and valuable, is for Hardy the fundamental power of mathematics, not an incidental result of correct thought. Aesthetics, while not unique to mathematics, is arguably more single-mindedly applied in mathematics than in any other human activity, including art of all kinds.Hardy, like many poets and artists as well as other mathematicians, is hesitant about his exposition of the aesthetics of mathematics. It seems to him vaguely disloyal and a possible waste of time. Mathematicians, after all, do mathematics, they don’t write about doing mathematics. And he has a point: either one gets the aesthetics of mathematics or one doesn’t. Mathematicians could care less about their reputations outside of mathematics. Hardy is therefore wary of going over the line from an ‘apologia’, that is, an explanation, to a defense, lest his should offend his colleagues. Most creative artists, I imagine, feel similarly.Hardy is acutely aware that an aesthetic, that is, a specific criterion or set of criteria, is that which is valuable for itself, and for no other reason. The aesthetic aims at nothing practical, nothing beyond itself. It is an argument from first principles that cannot be gainsaid by any other argument. It proves itself by its own assertion and by its own internal logic. Paradoxically, this is what makes an aesthetic so powerful: it doesn’t care what is thought of it outside the rules of its own creation. It is the scale of its own value. Its attraction is precisely its special kind of absoluteness.Aesthetics therefore is a dangerous business. It holds itself apart from criticism of any kind from those outside the circle which embraces it. It is an elitist activity. Its justification is merely the complete indifference about whether others subscribe to its views or not. There is no compulsion for others to ‘belong’ nor even to recognise its existence. It does not even claim any right to exist, for that would imply a purpose beyond itself.When a mathematician asserts that 1+1=2, there is no meaning beyond that assertion other than the expression of the aesthetic of mathematics. The assertion may have implications. Indeed this assertion has vast implications for the practice of mathematics. But that is the extent of its mathematical significance. It is a start in expressing the relevant aesthetic, but it is not intended to make the world better, or more intelligent, or more interested in mathematics.Does that make all aesthetics equal? Hardy says that the highest ambition “is to leave behind something of permanent value.” Value cannot be permanent unless it is intrinsic, of value in and of itself. But such intrinsic value is not arbitrary. The aesthetics adhered to by the professions - law, medicine, science - for example are distinctly different and incommensurate; but they are not arbitrary. Rather they are arrived at through social processes and accepted for what they are - the way we do things.Nonetheless a distinction can be made between fundamental criteria of action (I hesitate to call them aesthetics at this point) which are hidden, implicit, and unexpressed, from those that are made explicit, revealed, and given for consideration to others without the threat of compulsion. It is only the latter that are aesthetics. The former we can categorise as mere prejudice or, at best, unconsidered preferences. An aesthetic then must be articulated and expressed to be considered as such. When it is, it develops an uncanny power. The greater the precision of the articulation, the greater its attractiveness. I can’t account for this except as an empirical observation of the way in which people respond to aesthetic propositions. ‘Justice’, for example, as an abstract criterion is far less captivating than ‘the just treatment of relationships among those with same sex preferences as a matter of law’. This latter aesthetic has become accepted throughout Western Europe and North America as it has become expressed. An aesthetic is likely to attract those with a talent to employ it creatively. If for no otter reason than the social comfort of being among ‘like-minded’ people, that is others who appreciate not just the same things but the ability itself to appreciate those things. Hardy identifies curiosity, professional pride and ambition for reputation within the profession as general aesthetic aspects, applicable to many others than mathematicians. The principle aesthetic criteria of mathematics that Hardy identifies, however, is that of ‘pattern’, more specifically patterns of ideas. It has always struck me that it is precisely this aesthetic that is presented in Herman Hesse’s novel The Glass Bead Game, published almost contemporaneously with A Mathematician’s Apology. The game in question is never described except to the extent that it involves the identification of patterns across otherwise discrete fields of human knowledge - mathematics, history, politics, painting, poetry, physics, etc. A mathematical aesthetic expanded universally in other words. My discussion with other readers suggests that indeed you either get this aesthetic, and find the book a treasure, or you don’t.Pattern-seeing rather than pattern-making is the essential mathematical skill. The difference is crucial, and what makes mathematics an empirical science. Numbers are there to be explored and interrogated. Mathematicians don’t invent, they discover, patterns that numbers have always had. These patterns are as real, perhaps even more real, than the patterns proposed by, say, physicists. The latter involve themselves with ‘strings’, and ‘quarks’, and ‘dark energy’, for example. But these are mere hypotheses in comparison with the factual solidity of the number 2, or the logical necessity of more than one cardinal order of infinity.There are ugly and beautiful patterns in mathematics. One might suppose that this distinction is also arbitrary. But as Hardy explains, it is not arbitrary at all, nor is it vague even if its details are obvious only within the profession. Hardy refers to this as the ‘seriousness’ of a theorem or a proof. A serious proof, like Euclid’s proof of the infinity of prime numbers is short, un-showy, and (surprisingly) surprising. It has a seductive elegance that does not so much force as it does invite acceptance.A component of seriousness is ‘significance’. This Hardy further divides into ‘generality’ and ‘depth’. Without these characteristics, theorems, however ingenious, remain curiosities of interest only to puzzlers and hobbyists. On the other hand, too much generality and a theorem becomes abstractly insipid. Depth is even more subtle and has to do with the virtuosity involved in solving a problem that has just the right degree of generality and difficulty - again using innovative or unexpected ...“line of attack” to get to a solution. Such a proof “should resemble a simple and clear-cut constellation, not a scattered cluster in the Milky Way.”Ultimately metaphors like this are inevitable, not because the criteria are vague but because they have been so internalized by practitioners that they are almost pre- (or perhaps post-) linguistic. They ‘know it when they see it’ not because they are inexperienced and unsophisticated dilettantes, but they are able to ‘walk the talk’ so well that it is unnoticed by consciousness. The aesthetic becomes truly a ‘law written on the heart’ for better or worse.Hardy makes several mentions of how the aesthetic becomes obsolete and how it might be modified. Cambridge, for example, “crippled its mathematics for a century” by insisting on examinations that were exclusively about technique at the expense of creativity. Only by having the personal courage to move against this established norm did the situation improve. The toleration of such ‘rebellion’ is clearly, therefore, a necessary characteristic of the aesthetic-society, as it were.A Mathematician’s Apology is a highly personal statement, as its title implies. But the fact that its contents are only usually revealed over late night brandies during international academic conferences, doesn’t make it idiosyncratic or merely anecdotal. Without the mathematical talent sufficient to participate in the community that shares the aesthetic, it is perhaps impossible to appreciate the power of the aesthetic Hardy outlines. My summary of Hardy’s outline is undoubtedly inadequate. But it is, I think, sufficient to establish the almost miraculous way in which a professional discipline can create and sustain criteria of value that are not only independent of economic or commercial imperatives, but markedly antithetical to them. One might say that mathematics is serious business indeed.Appendix: Aesthetics and Fake NewsAn aesthetic has no intentional meaning beyond itself but it does have an incidental effect in the sense that it eliminates any consideration of truth. Since an aesthetic is its own truth, it cannot be compared or verified by reference to any other truth. This might appear as an aesthetic defect until it is realized that an aesthetic has a great epistemological consequence. It eliminates what has come to be known as fake news.Fake news isn’t fake because it is intentionally wrong or not (although it may be). It is fake because it is irrelevant in a given aesthetic. Fake ‘fake news’ are purported facts which are presented for some reason other than their mere presentation. It exists when there is an ulterior motive that remains unexpressed, a purpose - political, economic, or otherwise pragmatic - which is beyond the simple factual assertion.It takes some practice to know whether one is dealing with an aesthetic or some other instrumental or intermediate criterion of value. The phrase ‘this is important because...’ is a giveaway that whatever is being discussed is not an aesthetic. Even what follows the ‘because’ - it is right; it is expedient; it is effective; it is sensible - may not be an aesthetic. Often we hide our aesthetic under layers of rationalization so that we may not be aware ourselves what our aesthetic is.When a politician claims that a news story is fake, it is because he has some underlying interest he wants to promote, some hidden aesthetic, possibly Power, possibly wealth, possibly reputation. But never ‘truth’, this being the underlying aesthetic whose revelation might be damaging to itself.When a physicist or a social scientist makes a claim about reality, he or she is also making claim that is fake. They may use the term ‘truth’ to defend such a claim, saying that it ‘fits the facts’ better than alternatives, or that ‘it will cost us less to do X than to do Y’ but these are statements that confirm the existence of some other criterion that constitutes the reason that their assertion should be accepted. Only when we reach the terminal response-point ‘just because’ have we encountered what can be called the fundamental aesthetic that can’t be defended, only accepted or rejected, have these scientists approached the directness of the aesthetic of mathematics."
1,0521427061,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7232207-fiona,5,"I nearly studied maths at university, because of this book.When I was sixteen, I was scared of the grades and numbers end of academia, and I was determined that whatever I was going to study - and it was going to be something, and a lot of it - I was going to do it for the love of it. I was going to read around my subjects, follow tangents and pick whatever took my fancy. So, a few months into a Maths A-level, I took this out of Southampton Central Library, and I didn't give it back for nearly a year. The joy for numbers and patterns is infectious. The pure love for picking out order and seeing connections is one of my favourite things. I am convinced that you can talk about the most boring subject in the world, whatever it may be, but if you do it with love and that sparkle in your eye, people will want to listen, and ask questions, and find out more.This is how GH Hardy made mathematics for me, and why sometimes I still look him up, and come back to this book, and remember why scholarship and finding out about things make me more excited about the world than anything else. They make me remember why I fall in love with people who get enthusiastic, and why I seek out friends who know about things that I don't, and why I read widely. This book sparked my love of recreational maths, word puzzles, cryptic crosswords, steganography.The first time I read his proof for why the square root of two is an irrational number - short, quick, and with ""Isn't this beautiful?"" commentary - I followed it along with a pen and paper. I love his discussion of elegance, and how you can do things with numbers that are elegant, and why that is a legitimate thing to strive for. In the rest of my life, I want to make things that are elegant and clever and reach out to people like GH Hardy does. Every so often I come back to it and I get exactly the same feelings and they push me forward again. This is a book for when I am tired of everything else. It helps me go back to looking things in the eye.The first half of A Mathematician's Apology is a foreword, and it is a friend and former student of Hardy's writing about his life. The context of a story is never as clean and self-contained as the story itself. Real life that has not been picked and chosen is not as clean as that single persuasive essay with the purpose of showing you how much fun a thing can be. The foreword makes me want to go out and read everything and write things down, because I have to do it all now, because one day I won't be able to.I don't get to recommend this book to very many people, because apparently ""it's about maths"" is a turn-off. Somehow when I recommend this to people they have a very long to-read list that rears its head in the way that it doesn't for other books. That's okay. It's special to me, and a gem that I will quietly nurse for the times that I'm sad, and I won't force it on people with such phenomenally long other lists. But this book has amplified the person that I might have been into the person that I am, and every so often it does it again, and GH Hardy feels like one of my best friends even though this is all of his work that I know, and I am an non-Oxbridge-educated girl so if we'd met I would have bored him to tears. It's okay. I've got a lot from it anyway."

The public does not need to be convinced that there is something in mathematics. (c)Q:I am a lawyer, or a stockbroker, or a professional cricketer, because I have some real talent for that particular job. I am a lawyer because I have a fluent tongue, and am interested in legal subtleties; I am a stockbroker because my judgment of the markets is quick and sound; I am a professionalcricketer because I can bat unusually well. I agree that it might be better to be a poet or a mathematician, but unfortunately I have no talent for such pursuits. (c)Q:I am not suggesting that this is a defence which can be made by most people, since most people can do nothing at all well. But it is impregnable when it can be made without absurdity, as it can by a substantial minority: perhaps five or even ten percent of men can do something rather well. It is a tiny minority who can do something really well, and the number of men who can do two things well is negligible. If a man has any genuine talent he should be ready to make almost any sacrifice in order to cultivate it to the full. (c)Q:I said that a mathematician was a maker of patterns of ideas, and that beauty and seriousness were the criteria by which his patterns should be judged. (с)Q:Real mathematics has no effects on war. No one has yet discovered any warlike purpose to be served by the theory of numbers or relativity, and it seems very unlikely that anyone will do so for many years. It is true that there are branches of applied mathematics, such as ballistics and aerodynamics, which have been developed deliberately for war and demand a quite elaborate technique: it is perhaps hard to call them ‘trivial’, but none of them has any claim to rank as ‘real’. They are indeed repulsively ugly and intolerably dull; even Littlewood could not make ballistics respectable, and if he could not who can? So a real mathematician has his conscience clear; there is nothing to be set against any value his work may have; mathematics is, as I said at Oxford, a ‘harmless and innocent’ occupation.The trivial mathematics, on the other hand, has many applications in war. The gunnery experts and aeroplane designersfor example, could not do their work without it. And the general effect of these applications is plain: mathematics facilitates (if not so obviously as physics or chemistry) modern, scientific, ‘total’ war.It is not so clear as it might seem that this is to be regretted...

3,0521427061,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1286876-nick,4,"Amusing, even if it was as sad as the introduction suggested. Read it in high school, but haven't since. Glad I took another crack at it. It just about made me want to crack open one of my math books! I enjoyed the style of exposition, as well as much of the message, though, admittedly, I probably lost track of an argument here or there.I think avoided pulling out some of the more quoted passages, though I'm sure these aren't entirely original selections:68: If a man has any genuine talent, he should be ready to make almost any sacrifice in order to cultivate it to the full.70: ... it is undeniable that a gift for mathematics is one of the most specialized talents, and that mathematicians as a class are not particularly distinguished for general ability of versatility. If a man is any sense a real mathematician, then it is a hundred to one that his mathematics will be far better than anything else he can do, and that he would be silly if he surrendered any decent opportunity of exercising his one talent in order to do undistinguished work in other fields.73: It is quite true that most people can do nothing well. <-- Dang, Hardy. How do you really feel?77: A man's first duty, a young man's at any rate, is to be ambitious. Ambition is a noble passion which may legitimately take many forms...80: [A mathematician's] subject is the most curious of all -- there is none in which truth plays such odd pranks.116: Mathematics may, like poetry or music, 'promote and sustain a lofty habit of mind'...117-8: It is indeed rather astonishing how little practical value scientific knowledge has for ordinary men, how dull and commonplace such of it as has value is, and how its value seems almost to vary inversely to its reputed utility. <-- ah, school143: When the world is mad, a mathematician may find in mathematics an incomparable anodyne. For mathematics is, of all the arts and sciences, the most austere and the most remote, and a mathematician should be of all men the one how can easily take refuge where, as Bertrand Russell says, 'one at least of our nobler impulses can best escape from the dreary exile of the actual world.'"
4,0521427061,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1013182-graychin,2,"I wonder how much my enjoyment of this book was hampered by my mathematical incompetence. Not too much, I hope. CP Snow’s introduction is as good as the book, but you can’t fault Hardy with not giving you something to chew on. Rather than try to summarize my feelings about Hardy’s little book, I’m going to take the lazy option here and simply repost from my blog:-In A Mathematician’s Apology G.H. Hardy estimates that only five or ten people in a hundred can do something “rather well.” Considerably fewer are really gifted. We do not each have a valuable talent waiting for discovery. We may dream of making names for ourselves, but most “talents” are talents only by inflation, and many true talents are never valued. The influence of the cult of achievement extends even beyond its membership. Those who renounce the pursuit of worldly accomplishment often do so with other (more comfortably nebulous) goals in mind: sainthood, perhaps, or self-realization. They’re chasing the same fox by another tail.Hardy’s calculation is stark, and depressing. I’ve been working on a novel two nights each week for the past four years. I’m well into my third draft and hope to shop it around to agents this summer. Re-reading and re-writing it is a bruising, infuriating, ego-punishing business. What I’ve created is, I think, better than a lot of what gets published today, but that’s saying awfully little when 99% of what gets published is an unjustifiable waste of both writer’s and reader’s time. Almost every book ever written more than deserves its inevitable oblivion.My book surely will too. Though I’m bold enough to say that it’s “better than many,” I’m not going to fool myself and say “better than 99%.” It may beat fifty or even sixty percent of the schlock printed these days, but I won’t bluff any higher than that. Even if I succeed in getting it published, it’s not something to be too ridiculously proud of. If writing it has taught me anything, it’s that I am no Herman Melville or Henry James. Tonic as it may be to fess up to that inadequacy, my sickness is such that I plod on anyway. I’m even making notes for a second book. Ambition isn’t going to let lack of genius stand in its way.I may be neglecting avenues for achievement that are better suited to me. Hardy writes that “poetry is more valuable than cricket, but Bradman would be a fool if he sacrificed his cricket in order to write second-rate minor poetry.” I know nothing about cricket or Bradman, but I’ll agree that you don’t give up on a first-rate talent merely because it happens to be for a second-rate activity. I manage to make a living in the business world without much effort. What might I achieve if I focused my ambitions in that direction? But most days it’s a struggle even to fake a tepid enthusiasm.According to Hardy, first-rate minds care only for creation. If second-rate minds care for it too, so much the worse for them. They would do better, he says, to restrict themselves to the very second-rate tasks of criticism and appreciation. “Appreciation.” The term, as he utters it, drips condescension. But I want to say that Hardy gets it wrong here. He shows his scheme of values to be debased. It may be that I’m too democratic-minded, or just plotting myself an escape from Hardy’s sentence, but I hate the idea that the worthiest of human endeavors is beyond the reach of most people. Surely it’s not only scarce things that can have ultimate value?Appreciation, in the sense of pure enjoyment, seems to me a better candidate than creative accomplishment for the title of “man’s true work.” It may sound Jeffersonian (“pursuit of happiness”), or Epicurean, or bourgeois of me to say so. I don’t mean that people with leisure are morally superior to those without it. But though it’s not an idea that lends itself to proof by argument, I do believe that, other things being equal, there’s no nobler human aspiration than simply to enjoy and delight in things. To appreciate a particular face, a meal, a tree, a note, a book, a fact, an idea is something available to most of us. To enjoy something to the limit of one’s capacity is better than to create it."
5,0521427061,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14046996-roy-lotz,4,"The first thing the reader of this book will notice is that Hardy is an excellent writer. Although he repeatedly insists that his only talent lay in his mathematical ability, it is clear that he is a seasoned wordsmith.The first mark of a good writer is their seemingly effortless ability to convey their personality through the written word, no matter the subject or format. The reader is immediately presented with Hardy the man, as if he is sitting in front of you giving a lecture.One of the drawbacks of revealing your personality in such a direct way is that the reader is tempted to judge you, the author, rather than the content of your book. I certainly feel this temptation, as Hardy is not very likable. He immediately comes across as arrogant, rude, forceful, snobbish, opinionated, and gruff. He shoots off his views with the nonchalance of a college professor used to his students sitting in forced attention in crowded lecture halls. He does not hesitate to speculate on matters of which he knows little. In short, I don’t wish to have met him.Hardy insists that mathematics is the vocation in which one comes most directly in touch with reality. This is a sort of escapism, also seen in Russell and Plato, where brilliant men (and Hardy is clearly brilliant) play ducks and drakes with ideas, skipping them across the surface of their intellects like smooth stones, rather than contemplating vile things like breakfast or the weather. Hardy also insists that mathematical fame is permanent, the closest thing that a person can ever come to immortality. These ideas, so appealing when stated by Plato or Descartes, are almost nauseating with Hardy; I shudder at the thought that he has reached some sort of immortality.How ironic, then, that Hardy will most likely be remembered by the general mass of humankind for this little essay, rather than his mathematical achievements. And it is a fantastic essay, don’t get me wrong. To repeat, Hardy is an excellent writer. He is direct, clear, organized, and bold. Most of all, however, Hardy is honest, and this is a rare enough quality to almost redeem his whole arrogant personality. I would especially recommend it to those capable of the cold, aesthetic joy one experiences from beautiful proofs, like Euclid’s proof of the infinite number of primes. For those like myself, whose dull intellect shuts them off from these joys, this is a curious look into the psychology of such individuals."
6,0521427061,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25942645-mark-hebwood,5,"What a wonderful time I had with this book. GH Hardy, one of last century’s towering mathematical figures now known to a wider audience through the film “The Man Who Knew Infinity”, looks back on his life at a time when, by his own testimony, his mathematical genius was fading. The opening lines establish a sense of melancholy that I was never quite able to banish when reading his memoir:It is a melancholy experience for a professional mathematician to find himself writing about mathematics. The function of a mathematician is to do something, to prove new theorems, to add to mathematics, and not to talk about what he or other mathematicians have done.And yet, throughout the rest of his account, we encounter an intellect as sharp and penetrating as it is possible to meet. Hardy shares his thoughts about the aesthetics and truth value of mathematics, and his thoughts are profound, but they are offered with the charming nonchalance of somebody who does not seem to be truly aware of his own intellectual calibre.The thought that resonated with me most is the idea that mathematics is, to speak with Hardy’s own diction, ‘useless’, or to put it into less colourful language reserved for somebody who is not a mathematician (me...), free of purpose. I believe what Hardy had in mind was to convey the idea that the study of mathematical objects is itself its purpose, that discovery of new mathematics “pushes back the darkness by a millimetre”, as Greg Chaitin, another genius mathematician, put it, that the purpose of mathematics is not measurable by any practical application that may not have been made without it. In this interpretation, the study of mathematics can be an example of pure thought, of pure intellectual pursuit unencumbered, constrained or possibly diminished, by the demands of the practical world. And that, to me at least, is a beautiful and encouraging thought.When he wrote his account, Hardy, in the words of Jethro Tull, may have felt “too old to rock and roll, too young to die”, but I want to finish by letting the man himself speak. I started my comment with the first lines of Hardy’s book, allow me to finish it with some of the last:I have never done anything ‘useful’. No discovery of mine has made, or is likely to make, directly or indirectly, for good or ill, the least difference to the amenity of the world. Judged by all practical standards, the value of my mathematical life is nil; and outside mathematics it is trivial anyhow. I have just one chance of escaping a verdict of complete triviality, that I may be judged to have created something worth creating. The case for my life, then, or for that of any one else who has been a mathematician in the same sense in which I have been one, is this: that I have added something to knowledge, and helped others to add more; and that these somethings have a value which differs in degree only, and not in kind, from that of the creations of the great mathematicians, or of any of the other artists, great or small, who have left some kind of memorial behind them."
7,0521427061,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6226405-yasiru,5,"The text may be found at http://www.math.ualberta.ca/~mss/misc...I had the good fortune to come across this title just as I was finally beginning to see the glimmers of beauty in mathematics thanks to the efforts of some wonderful instructors on the subject during my later school years. It called upon me for a deeper reflection on my chosen pursuit, which at that point appealed to me for its fundamental importance to the other sciences and for the simple pleasure that can be gleaned of it. I was confronted with a fleeting, tricksome nature even in mathematical truth, which had till then been sacrosanct and taken for granted. It became apparent that there was more artistic excitement in mathematics than the safety of empirical sciences and it has been my great love ever since, however modestly ability dresses me.Hardy's is an essay of paradoxes and duals, with examples littered through the text. These may seem contradictory at a glance, but close scrutiny reveals them to be mutually reliant points that hint to the complexities of Hardy's pursuit. One instance is in his claim that mathematical patterns are more enduring than any artist's or poet's. While this may leave many an artist or poet bristling, this endurance is manifest in the progression of a mathematician's significant ideas, even though these are all in a language of ideas that does not rely on being evocative (so unlike the artist or poet). This is at odds however, with the aesthetic appreciation to be had in nontrivial mathematics that Hardy keeps returning to. The prospect of leaving some mark so enduring is certainly catering to ambition (which Hardy encourages), but this is incompatible with failing to capture beauty, and so it is that one cannot stand without the other. It has been said that this is a tragic account, but here is a thread of hope- that one should remain steadfast in the area of one's talent and atop that cultivate ambitions and seek too what is beautiful. There is a terrible, indubitable rationale here which could strike some as arrogant (though even if it were taken to be so, not something diminishing from the work), but is ultimately a course of efficiency (something Hardy valued in his mathematical aesthetic) devoid of any lingering melancholy.Another instance is what he has to say about the worthwhile mathematics and trivial. Frequently, Hardy is misrepresented as disdaining applied mathematics upon the haughty perch of the pure. This is unfortunate since special mention is made that mathematicians do not tend to revel in the uselessness of their work. Hardy is no fool to try untangling the mathematics that will come to some use and what stands detached and austere. He draws the crucial distinction instead based on aesthetic value once again, setting aside those abundant trifles of mathematics so often connected with the mundane world of everyday and advocating the deep framework (of rather few significant contributions) of what might be dubbed the 'true mathematics'. Hardy is rather half-hearted about elaborating on his standards of beauty, but there is no real surprise in this for anyone acquainted with higher mathematics, because it really is a difficult thing to define. There is efficiency and sweeping elegance in a great result, but too a contribution to that progression of ideas which makes mathematics so enduring. Whether these criteria capture beauty is contestable and so I make no claims. But this difficulty in explaining a thing like beauty highlights the crucial problem in Hardy's endeavour to explain to the public what a mathematician does and why. He justifies the pursuit of the true mathematics exactly because it is so removed from mundane being and so comes of purer intentions than much else that can be directed to harm as well as good, but it is a difficult thing to impart the joy of actually doing mathematics to the uninitiated, which is perhaps why so many reviews have picked upon the thread of personal tragedy here (partly owing to the foreword I suppose, thought Hardy's circumstances are the least of the work's significance, I thought, both on my first reading and now) instead of the 'apology' itself. There is nowadays a great scuffle to get some manner of emotional fix upon an author one is reading. This sort of thing is seldom the author's intent (else they would simply save themselves the trouble of writing a reasoned and coherent account with objective value and instead send their diaries to a publisher), especially in a work as this where the author is attempting to convey a position and defend it. The arguments do not require lenses coloured with the author's circumstances. I imagine Hardy the pure mathematician would rather have avoided this, as he remarks the following in the present work (something of a spoiler warning is due here)-""Dr Snow had also made an interesting point about §8. Even if we grant that ‘Archimedes will be remembered when Aeschylus is forgotten’, is not mathematical fame a little too ‘anonymous’ to be wholly satisfying? We could form a fairly coherent picture of the personality of Aeschylus (still more, of course, of Shakespeare or Tolstoi) from their works alone, while Archimedes and Eudoxus would remain mere names. Mr J M Lomas put this point more picturesquely when we were passing the Nelson column in Trafalgar square. If I had a statue on a column in London, would I prefer the columns to be so high that the statue was invisible, or low enough for the features to be recognizable? I would choose the first alternative, Dr Snow, presumably, the second.""(Dr Snow here is C P Snow, who wrote the foreword to this edition. It's worth reading, but perhaps after Hardy's own words, since its biographical tint somewhat along the line I've discussed above may detract from the potent general ideas Hardy is forwarding here.)Few other works have attempted the exposition of what creative enterprise demands and entails quite so well as this one, and this from a master who has seen ability and passions come and go. I recommend it highly."
8,0521427061,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5873859-phil,2,"I object not to the message, but rather its form. Essentially, GH argues that mathematics is worth the world's time and effort--that it is a beautiful, creative, and noble pursuit. I'm already convinced of this, so maybe I'm not his target audience and should therefore shut up. I've spent a non-trivial amount of around mathematicians. They are almost a different species, and I envy their passion and analytic abilities. While I'm glad GH tried to be their advocate--which must've been more necessary when he wrote this than it is today--I don't understand why some hold this book/essay in such high esteem.GH mingles mathturbation with emperor's-new-clothes rhetoric. He asserts (I'm paraphrasing) that a true intellect appreciates math's beauty, thus implying that if one fails to appreciate the promised beauty, she must not be an intellect (this is further paraphrased as, ""if you can't do the math on that then I can't help ya'"" [Or perhaps by describing it as a preemptive ""No true Scotsman"" fallacy]). He spends a large part of the essay/book itemizing mathematics nice qualities.GH has a real inferiority complex with respect to his love, mathematics, and his writing ability about it. The former expresses itself via a prim smugness, the later via his confessions of his inability to express concepts neatly.I wish GH had tried to write something less universal and more personal. I wanted more insight into what it's like to be a capital-M Mathematician. I wanted to understand his thought process, how he experiences mathematical joy, how he touches Truth, how math has shaped his person and life, etc. The last chapter, in which he drifts in that direction, is among the book/essay's most compelling. But it's far too short and superficial to be sufficient.I suppose I will remain a math philistine.And while they end up only tangentially relating to his thesis, the first few chapters, in which GH discusses the nature of ambition, ability, growth, etc., are ultimately what justify the price of admission.

9,0521427061,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1821338-jake,3,"Recently I started teaching myself to program. An article I read recommended Project Euler, which is a set of math exercises intended to be completed with computer code. So for the last few months I've been doing more writing than reading, as I puzzled through these math problems. Research on various problems led to me to other math websites, and often G.H. Hardy's short book ""A Mathematician's Apology"" was mentioned in various contexts. I picked it up, and found a lot of what Hardy wrote applied to other fields, including the computer programming I was attempting to learn. Boiled down to its essence, ""A Mathematician's Apology"" is a book about beauty. Hardy writes: ""the mathematician's patterns, like the painter's or the poet's, must be beautiful... there is no permanent place in the world for ugly mathematics."" The nature of this beauty, in all its subtlety, is what Hardy spends most of the book writing about. To him, beautiful math combines simplicity with depth- connecting previously unconnected branches of mathematics and revealing new solutions to unsolvable problems- as well as new problems to be solved. You can apply the same ideas to science, or to art- there is something deeply zen about Hardy's formulation. This is strange, because Hardy himself is deeply unzen. As C.P. Snow writes in his long introduction, ""it is very rare for a writer to realize, with the finality of truth, that he is absolutely finished."" While beautiful, the book is very sad, because Hardy was deeply depressed when he wrote it. At the end of his career, with his health failing, he seems to have abandoned all hope. Even writing seems to bring him no satisfaction: ""There is no scorn more profound, or on the whole more justifiable, than that of the men who make for the men who explain. Exposition, criticism, appreciation, is work for second-rate minds."" For a man who saw so far into such undiscovered philosophical territory, it's sad that Hardy didn't acquire a sense of perspective about himself, or his place in the universe. He hung his entire self-worth on his sense of mathematical accomplishment, and as his powers faded, so did his ability to experience joy. This kind of unzen attitude is found throughout the book- here's just one small taste: ""I shall assume that I am writing for readers who are full, or have in the past been full, of a proper spirit of ambition. A man's first duty, a young man's at any rate, is to be ambitious."" Hardy's unhappiness has been explained in a number of ways- dissatisfaction with his work, a horror at the oncoming war (this book was written in 1940), and perhaps problems of the heart (Snow hints that Hardy was gay, but it seems that he lived asexually.) But I think it's really his world-view that ultimately defeated him- this idea that a man is to be judged by what he creates and nothing else. No man who truly believes that could ever be lastingly happy- especially not in old age. "
10,0521427061,http://goodreads.com/user/show/979520-douglas,5,"Here's a reason one might want to read this book. In his introduction, C.P. Snow points out that Hardy's capacity for dissimulation ""was always minimial."" And he goes on to illustrate this with a passage in the Apology where Hardy says, ""I do not remember having felt, as a boy, any passion for mathematics, and such notions as I may have had of the career of a mathematician were far from noble. I thought of mathematics in terms of examinations and scholarships; I wanted to beat other boys, and this seemed to be the way in which I could do so most decisively."" Besides revealing a lucid self-knowledge, it provides some of the tragedy to this book. For we know it is said by a person who's decisive abilities were decisively layed low by a heart attack which occured in Hardy's 60th year; reminding us that we do not own our gifts and that they can be taken from us at any time. It is a beautiful story of a man trying to hold himself up with dignity and survey a beautiful territory that is now inaccessible to him. He sees that not all of his struggles and triumphs in it were noble. Thus he manages to transcend the competition that once carried him to fame and tells us the beauty of his subject. He asks us to accompany him whereas in former times we would have been rigorously examined by his ""brillant and concentrated mind."""
11,0521427061,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3737508-nicolle,5,"This memoir from G.H Hardy has truly changed my perception of mathematics and mathematicians. Hardy is a remarkable man, though unusual (he likes cricket!) and with collaborations with Littlewood and Ramanujan he made astonishing breakthroughs in the mathematical field. The one thing which struck me in this novel was Hardy's sorrow caused by old age, he seemed in mourning for the creativity and drive for mathematics that he had once held. Some of his deep emotions are layed bare in this novel, and describes his woes and triumphs through his life, in particular the book which describe drinking in a common room at Trinity College inspiring him to become the reputable mathematician that he became.Truly wonderful, I would recommend this to anyone with a heart, or an appreciation for the art of mathematics."
12,0521427061,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5653612-laura-m-ndez,2,"I read this book because it was quoted in a coursera class about Genetics and Evolution. The quote was: ""I have never done anything ‘useful’. No discovery of mine has made, or is likely to make, directly or indirectly, for good or ill, the least difference to the amenity of the world."" Interestingly, one of Hardy's equation called the ""Hardy-Weinberg's equation"" is used in genetics, in population allele analysis and in fact it has become very useful for geneticians that ultimately benefit medicine and our well being. I wanted to read this also because I often feel very guilty and apologetic about studying a basic science, and I wanted to see his point. What I keep thinking about is a quote from Leonardo Da Vinci: ""Everything connects with everything else"". It sounds maybe a little bit mystic but I realised that any knowledge, even though we cannot forsee it's application clearly or at all, is information that can be useful in any other field. And why not consider the mere joy of finding things out? I often have the feeling that scientists should get involved with humanistics more and then they would appreciate more their work outside of their own fields, plus, better decisions can be taken."

The intro is almost as long as the actual Hardy part. Apparently Graham Greene, in a review, said that along with Henry James' notebooks, Hardy's book was the best description of what it's like to be a creative artist. Despite much googling, I sadly cannot find a copy of the original Greene review. Perhaps I'll finish the rest this evening, if the wonderful Indian food we're off to eat with friends in celebration of J's birthday does not put me right to sleep;-)I've been meaning to read this for years. I only gave it a 4 instead of 5 because some of the discussion of pure or real Math was over my head. I absolutely loved the intro by C.P. Snow and greatly enjoyed the play by the Nat'l Theatre in UK about Hardy and Ramanujan: A Disappearing Number. I think I would have loved to have heard Hardy lecture."
17,0521427061,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1963960-bill-johnston,3,"Despite how well known it is, and how many say it speaks for mathematics, I am unable to give this book a high rating. I doubt the less-than-stellar 50 page introduction to a 100 page book biased me against the actual A Mathematician's Apology. The Apology is a long-winded, repetitive statement of a few core beliefs of mathematics professors: that pure math is better than applied, that logic is better than reality, and that they can take satisfaction that their actions will neither help nor harm the human race.The good parts are where he tries to illustrate mathematics, but even at that, The Man Who Loved only Numbers does a better job. This isn't to say there aren't good reasons to read this book: it's a fast read, it's short, and it contains a period description of prewar high academia in England."

I was taking an after-lunch walk in the library and suddenly the name came to mind, so I pick it up from the shelf. I was expecting some self-important manifesto with little information. I was wrong. Though often sounds like he has no interaction with the world outside of mathematics, he's pretty honest. He started off by saying that serious mathematicians do math, don't write stuff about math. I was like ""hmmm"". Then he went on: but I'm too old to be a serious mathematician, so now I'm gonna write this book about math. That cracked me up. Anyways, I was pleased to see his perspective on what constitutes ""real"" math, and how the math's ""importance"" depends on how it connects ideas and the aesthetics. It's an interesting book that's too short to not read. "
21,0521427061,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4908949-aditi,2,"Since I have recommended this book to some friends, I'd better review it for them. It isn't going to be easy, just like the book wasn't easy to read, so here goes nothing:1. This is an enlightening book, especially if you are looking to create some form of original work in academics. Are you planning on writing a doctorate thesis at some point? Read this, because it puts forth another academician's ideas about what a good contribution is. It helps that Hardy managed very well for himself. Even if you're not looking to pursue an academic career, it is still an insightful read in case at some point you would like to create something original.It sheds light on the nature and characteristics of good work, and I think the principles may be extended to any field with modifications. It even warns well about addressing the audience with some respect, and gives proof of what happens when an author doesn't do that (Point 2).2. This book was difficult to read, not so much due to the subject, or the words used to describe them, but because it is:a. Addressed constantly and only to men-This was a perennial distraction for me. I've never read anything else that excludes women so thoroughly. I was ridiculously relieved when he used the word ""women"" once in the last few pages of the books, which backhandedly described why he felt men were more valuable to society than women. Once charming sentence says something about ""... parents clamouring for a useful education for their sons."" I want to stress here that those of use who cannot travel in time are all moulded by the time we're embedded in, and so please don't put this book down in a fit of feminist outrage. Reading this also helped me appreciate how much more difficult lives must have been for women in those times, and before that. I appreciate where we are academically now with this insight. It boggled my mind, and it is what I will remember most about this very short book. Wow.b. Addressed to people (men) already in the know-This is particularly baffling as he makes it a point to say several times that the book was written for laypersons (laymen), and goes to some lengths to explain some math in easy terms. He refers to his peers by their names very often, and agrees with or refutes their work or arguments without explaining what they were. Perhaps people of his era then, or his profession now are aware of these gentlemen he refers to, and of what they said, but I could only read one side of the discussion- the author's, and so again, this book isn't written for a general audience. I may read this book again in the future, but simply due to point one, and as a text. I don't expect to derive any pleasure from that exercise. I do still recommend this book. Read it at least once, if just to understand how not to write about your work for laypeople."
22,0521427061,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49493552-boian-alexandrov,5,"This is a challenging novel. It is not a thriller, historical book or anything you’ve ever read. This is a book written by a Grand Master Mathematician telling the story about his Apprentice, the young genius Ramanujan, and about the wonderful creativity and the internal urge that, although rare, exist in some people on Earth making them search for the harmony and beauty of the Universe.Even if you do not know anything about Mathematics you will begin to feel the World of Ideas, although indirectly and probably as a blind man whom somebody described how wonderful the color of the blue sky is. But you will begin to understand that Mathematics is not simply a language that can solve and describe some technicalities in our world, but it is something absolutely different. You will see that Mathematics is an art, poetry, emotions - a deep and fantastic connection with another world, that is, with the powerful World of Ideas. Because, as Hardy writes, mathematicians observed and play with the patterns of the ideas, and:“The mathematician’s patterns, like the painter’s or the poet’s must be beautiful; the ideas like the colours or the words, must fit together in a harmonious way. Beauty is the first test: there is no permanent place in the world for ugly mathematics.” That said, if you cannot and do not like to read Dostoevsky and Hesse, Emerson and Gabriel García Márquez, Albert Einstein and Bertrand Russell, Mahatma Gandhi and Leo Tolstoy, Strugatsky Brothers and Arthur Clarke, Stanislaw Lem and Sogyal Rinpoche, please, do not even open this book! But for you, the others, that are trying to understand who you are and where you are living in and simply cannot live without this understanding, this book will be a treasure. This book will open a new door for you although, I believe, it will give you not answers but will raise more and unexpected questions. "
23,0521427061,http://goodreads.com/user/show/342694-spoko,2,"I am a bit of a sucker for esoteric works that stand out beyond their field. One of my favorite books is Eric Gill's Essay on Typography, for example. So I had asked for recommendations in an online forum, and this was one of the ones that was suggested. It was the only one that wasn't from the hard sciences, and it wasn't that long, so I figured I'd give it a shot. Honestly, I barely finished it. If it weren't that I am this particular type of sucker, and also that I had a goal of reading a certain number of books in one year, I probably wouldn't have finished it.It's not a bad book, it's just not that interesting. I've picked up a few gems of quotes along the way. But that's the majority of the value I've gotten from the book. The rest is probably pretty interesting to anyone with more math under their belt than I have, but it wasn't all that compelling to me. I do appreciate mathematics, and I even really enjoyed the couple of spots where he gets into actual theorems (the infinite supply of prime numbers, and the irrationality of the square root of 2). But throughout the rest of it, he really seemed to be defending himself and his choice of profession, or something. He does admit that, but that admission doesn't do much to make the book any more interesting.Next time I'm 1/3 the way into a book and I don't think I need to finish it, I'm gonna trust that feeling. Our time on this earth is limited, and I could have been spending it reading something much more interesting."
24,0521427061,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1276663-jenni-lunde,5,"This is something that English-loving people who hate math should read. Hardy was, in his terms, a ""pure"" (not applied or even ""useful"") mathematician. This means that he saw his world in terms of math (very complicated math), even though he realized that his world of math does not always represent ""reality."" In fact, in this work, he comes to think of math in terms of art, since it is made up entirely of human ideas and is open to play and interpretation. He also makes the obvious parallel of math as a language (of course) and illustrates his points through simple (think five times four) math problems. There're even a few jokes in it, though these are mainly meant for people who've studied at least Calculus. Ultimately, Hardy arrives at the realization that, even though he loves it, math is not ""real"" the way we recognize it as real, and so, unless he can think of himself as some kind of twisted artist, his life's work means nothing. This is the only book I know of that turns math into art, and does it well. It's sad, but there are a lot of distilled truths in this little apology--and it's only 100 pages long. "

Hardy after watching the movie about him and Ramanujan, which inspired me to know more of his personal life and professional work. G.H. Hardy has been famous for his brilliance in mathematics and eccentric character at the same time. This book tries to give a brief insight to mathematicians life in 29 chapters such as defining the usefulness of mathematics, real and applied parts of mathematics, etc. I was fascinated to see a mathematician's attitude towards real life applications and desires for not giving up. He highlights three important motives of a researcher without which one could not be more successful: (1) intellectual curiosity (2) professional pride (3) ambition. Finally, in the last chapter, he gives a small autobiography section to conclude his sayings. Reading this book is recommended not only to mathematicians but to researchers in any other fields who would like to understand the importance of his/her work and the dominant motives behind it. "

""A man who is always asking 'Is what I do worth while?' and 'Am I the right person to do it?' will always be ineffective himself and a discouragement to others."" Indeed, such people are so depressing. In his Apology, G.H. Hardy has gotten to a point in his life at which he feels creatively useless, and only then does he look back on his life and attempt to justify it by assessing pure mathematics as a career. The philosophical aspects are very interesting, whether or not you agree wholeheartedly, and whether or not the author's personality agrees with you. Even if you've heard all of these opinions before in some form --- as a pure mathematician probably will have --- the anecdotes, historical context and personality insights will appeal tremendously."

It's also a poignant and moving piece of autobiography. On the other hand I think it's bad for people to read it who don't have their own strong, fully formed ideas about math. Hardy is of the ""the only worthwhile thing is to pursue your talent"" school and the ""math is a young man's game"" school and the ""most people are mediocre"" school and generally will make anyone studying math feel bad and get discouraged if they don't have their own well-developed relationship to the study."

32,0521427061,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76014-raghu,3,"G. H. Hardy was a famous mathematician of the twentieth century. He was the one who invited the unknown Indian Mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan to Cambridge and let the world know of his genius. This book is a small volume. I would rather call it a monograph or a longish essay. It has a generous foreword by C. P. Snow, which makes it a book. The foreword by Snow is partly a biography of Hardy and brings out his lovable qualities and his passions in life. The foreword makes the book a personal one and a pleasure to read. The second part of the book contains Hardy’s musings on what he considers the aesthetics of Mathematics is. Hardy wrote the book in 1940 during WWII when he was 62 years old. Hence, one should read it bearing in mind the context and that it was eighty years ago. In the foreword, Snow paints a portrait of Hardy with great affection. Hardy was born in 1877, in Surrey, England into a modest professional family. His abilities with numbers surfaced even at the tender age of two when he could write numbers up to millions. He was shy, self-conscious, and classically anti-narcissistic. He didn’t want anyone to photograph him. Snow says probably not over five photographs of Hardy exist. He loved the game of cricket, had the eye of a natural ball-games player. He was good at tennis and was a good cricket batsman, perhaps just short of the standard of a first-class cricketer. Hardy watched a cricket game almost every day and followed cricket scores throughout his life, right up to his deathbed. He didn’t believe in God but struggled hard to tell his parents as it would be hurtful to them. Unlike introverted mathematicians, he had many illustrious friends and was happy in their company. Bertrand Russell, A.N. Whitehead, and J. M. Keynes were his companions in college. Snow says Hardy was happier than most people. He did most of his work in collaboration with Ramanujan and Littlewood. He and Littlewood published nearly a hundred papers over thirty-five years. He considered Ramanujan to be in the class of all-time greats like Euler and Gauss. With Ramanujan, Hardy produced five papers of the highest class. Hardy was a liberal, even had a large photograph of Lenin in his room. He had a deep dislike for wars, was not happy about Britain engaging in war, having seen both the world wars in his life. Unlike his friend and math collaborator Littlewood, Hardy didn’t play any role in helping the British military with his mathematics in the war effort. He took a lot of pride and satisfaction in that pure mathematics is useless and hence can do no harm - like being used in war to carry out destruction. Hardy wrote this book in 1940, early in the war, but lived past the end of the war till 1948. It must have deeply saddened him to see his beloved field of number theory playing an important role in decoding the German Enigma machine during WW II. Hardy was happy that prime numbers had no practical use and loved them for their beauty. Today, all the high-security internet transactions and government surveillance of citizens use deep encryption, which is possible only because of prime numbers. A widely used theorem in Genetics today, known as the Hardy-Weinberg principle, is one that Hardy and Wilhelm Weinberg proved independently. Towards the end of his life, Hardy tried to kill himself in his sixties but failed in the act. Snow visited him in his last days even as Gertrude, Hardy’s sister, cared for him till the end.‘A Mathematician’s Apology’ starts in self-doubt as Hardy believes strongly that mathematics is a young man’s game, more than any other art or science. At sixty-two, he lacks the freshness of mind, energy, or patience to be creative. He may still be competent enough at sixty, but it is useless to expect him to have original ideas. Why was it worthwhile for him to do mathematics all his life? What is the proper justification of a mathematician’s life? Is the work that a man does during his life worth doing, and why does he do it?The noblest ambition of a mathematician is that of leaving behind something of permanent value. There are many highly respected motives that lead men to research. However, three of them are more important than the rest. The first is intellectual curiosity, a desire for truth. Then, professional pride, the anxiety of satisfaction with one’s performance. Finally, ambition, a desire for reputation, and the position, even the power or the money, which it brings. If intellectual curiosity, professional pride, and ambition are the dominant incentives to research, then assuredly no one has a fairer chance of satisfying them than a mathematician. So, why not do mathematics in one’s life?Hardy says that languages die, but mathematical ideas do not. He grants that ‘Immortality’ may be a silly word, but probably a mathematician has the best chance at it, whatever it may mean. The Babylonian and Assyrian civilizations have perished; Hammurabi, Sargon, and Nebuchadnezzar are empty names today. Yet Babylonian mathematics is still interesting. They still use the Babylonian scale of 60 in astronomy (as of 1940). Hardy was interested in mathematics only as a creative art. Beauty is the first test in Maths. Ugly mathematics cannot exist in the world. A mathematician, like a painter or a poet, is a maker of patterns. If his patterns are more permanent than that of the others, it is because he makes them with ideas. A painter makes patterns with shapes and colors, a poet with words. A mathematician has no material to work with except ideas. Hence, his patterns are likely to last longer, since ideas wear less in time than words. Beauty and seriousness are the criteria by which we should judge his patterns. All these arguments may not convince the reader. Hardy finally launches the clinching argument of why his pursuit of mathematics was worthwhile. He says, ‘Well, I have done one the thing you all could never have done, and that is, to have collaborated with both Littlewood and Ramanujan on something like equal terms.’!Hardy makes the sweeping assertion in his apology that one can do great mathematics only when one is young. Ironically, his own friend Littlewood was productive in Maths even after passing the age of 90. Other summary dismissals like ‘Real mathematics is wholly useless and that useful mathematics is intolerably dull’ can put the reader off. He dismissed applied mathematics as unattractive but useful. If the reader can overlook these assertions and have respect for the brilliant mathematician that Hardy was, then he or she can read and enjoy the book. I relished reading it because I love cricket and Mathematics.   "
33,0521427061,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10145524-charles-daney,4,"There are, roughly, two sorts of people who might consider reading this very short book: those who know or work with a fairly large amount of mathematics, and those who don't. There are different things that should be said about the book to each group. Let's take the latter group first.One dictionary definition of ""apology"" is ""a formal spoken or written defense of some idea, religion, philosophy, etc."" People who've had little exposure to mathematics beyond the basics of ordinary arithmetic, solving simple equations, and perhaps a little plane geometry may hope that the apology in this book could help them understand what sorts of things are in more advanced kinds of mathematics. They may wonder why anyone who doesn't have to use anything beyond the basics might be interested in learning more about such things. Even someone exposed to basic calculus in college might have the same hope. For them the book may be somewhat disappointing, as it offers only two simple examples, and some general remarks on the characteristics of the ""best"" kind of mathematics. These two examples are the fact that the square root of two isn't a rational number - i. e. the ratio of two integers - and the fact that there are prime numbers larger than any given number one could choose. The explanations give a taste of what typical (but very simple) mathematical proofs are like. There are some who may find that enlightening if they have never been exposed to such things. But it's pretty thin gruel. It's like a foreigner dropping into a good roadside diner in Iowa and trying to understand from that what the U. S. as a whole is like.What may possibly be somewhat more informative is Hardy's discussion of his claim that ""A mathematician, like a painter or a poet, is a maker of patterns."" (p.84) This may be of interest to readers who are curious about how professional mathematicians think about their craft. It is a little bit complicated. First off, the patterns must have both ""beauty"" and ""seriousness"". Each of those requires further explanation. Of beauty, Hardy is pretty vague - something that's typical of discussions of almost any kind of ""beauty"". What he says is that the ideas which make up the pattern must ""like the colours [of a painting] or the words [of a poem] must fit together in a harmonious way."" (p. 85) But that just shifts the issue to what ""harmonious"" means. Hardy gives up by saying ""It may be hard to define mathematical beauty, but that is just as true of beauty of any kind."" (p. 85) One just ""knows"" it when one sees it.As for ""seriousness"", that's a more convoluted matter. Hardy says ""The seriousness of a mathematical theorem lies, not in its practical consequences, which are usually negligible, but in the significance of the mathematical ideas which it connects."" And ""a mathematical idea is 'significant' if it can be connected, in a natural and illuminating way, with a large complex of other mathematical ideas."" (p. 89) The two examples Hardy gives of ""significant"" theorems do illuminate ""significance"" to some extent - if one happens to be aware of the vast complex of connected ideas (having to do with the deeper nature of numbers and geometrical objects).Hardy goes on to discuss what ""significance"" involves. ""There are two things at any rate which seem essential, a certain generality and a certain depth; but neither quality is easy to define at all precisely."" (p. 103) He makes a stab at it anyhow. ""Generality"" is sort of related to abstractness, and ""depth"" has ""something to do with difficulty."" (p. 109).It turns out that it is not only the ultimate theorems themselves that must have ""beauty"", but the proofs should also have that as well. And in this case there should be ""a very high degree of unexpectedness, combined with inevitability and economy."" (p. 113) Both of Hardy's examples show this pretty well. Those are very elementary theorems, but even very advanced theorems can exhibit this beauty if they follow in this way from slightly less advanced ones. Professional mathematicians are generally not very satisfied with even (seemingly) simple theorems, like the Four Color Theorem, if their proofs are quite messy (which the proof of the FCT is to an extreme).So, will a reader who has little exposure to mathematics beyond the basics, but is sincerely curious to understand more, be satisfied with Hardy's narrative? I'd say that such readers would have to answer that for themselves. Probably what Hardy has to say will be most appreciated if and when readers go on to actually study more advanced mathematics. Then, and only then, will it be really worthwhile to use what Hardy's written in order to properly appreciate what is learned in the more advanced study. So this gives us an answer to what readers with much more exposure to mathematics may find valuable in Hardy's Apology: It may help clarify what they enjoy about mathematics, namely the aesthetic enjoyment of mathematics that is especially ""elegant"". However, they've probably come to similar conclusions on their own.Hardy does deal with another issue that is considerably more controversial: that is, whether it's important for the ""best"" mathematics to have - or not have - practical utility and applicability. Hardy, a confirmed pacifist, insisted that ""Real mathematics has no effect on war. No one has yet discovered any warlike purpose to be served by the theory of numbers or relativity, and it seems very unlikely that anyone will do so for many years."" (p. 140) Although counterexamples have appeared since that was written, they are quite insignificant in comparison to the beauty and (can I say?) grandeur of both theories. (""Grandeur"" is a property a related collection of theorems on the same topic may possess. Hardy doesn't mention it.)It's a waste of time to argue over the relative merits of ""pure"" vs. ""applied"" mathematics. If a particular professional mathematician prefers one over the other, it's just a matter of individual taste. If a given body of mathematics happens to have important applications, that fact needn't either enhance nor detract from whether the mathematics has significant value to those who work on it. And so neither case requires more or less ""apology"" (in the sense of an excuse or justification) that needs to be given for working on it.Hardy offers very little of a biographical nature in his Apology, although there are a few pages along such lines at the end. This is rather unfortunate. One would have hoped that such an eminent mathematician as Hardy might have offered a rather more detailed account of his professional working habits and how he arrived at his most noteworthy accomplishments. He wrote some great textbooks (alone or in collaboration), but his best theoretical work was in a legendary collaboration with J. E. Littlewood.The few biographical remarks that Hardy offers are somewhat downbeat, as the Apology was written late in his life, when he felt most of his creative energy had faded. Too, he seemed to have had for much of his life somewhat of an inferiority complex. Hardy was eight years older than Littlewood, so he may have always been at a disadvantage to the vigor of his collaborator. Littlewood also published one notable book for a general audience (Littlewood's Miscellany), which is quite different from the Apology, and has its own idiosyncratic strengths and weaknesses. Unfortunately, neither man had almost anything to say about their unique collaboration.The reprinted (1967) edition of the Apology, which came out 20 years after Hardy's death, has a long foreword by Hardy's friend C. P. Snow. As Snow wasn't a mathematician, it has little to say about mathematics, but contains some very useful biographical details, including much about Hardy's other great collaboration, with Srinivasa Ramanujan. Professional mathematicians may find this foreword the most interesting part of the book."
34,0521427061,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16398968-geevarghese-george,4,"Picked up this book after listening to Manjul Bhargavas talk on the usefulness of useless knowledge, where he quoted Hardy which went something like this ""..the greater bulk of real mathematics is useless since it provides mere intellectual satisfaction to the mathematician..""My dad being a school teacher teaching ""trivial"" mathematics, and having already seen The Man Who Knew Infinity and kinda getting attached to the portrayal of Hardy in that movie, I thought this would be a great read. And it was. This book has a very long intro by the people who actually published the book after Hardy's death. Until then it was kept within the circle of mathematicians in Oxford? The book starts by saying mathematics is for young people and if you're above 40 there's no point being a mathematician -- Hardy wrote the book when he was 60, so he clearly felt his ability has diminished and that he was more productive when he collabed with Littlewood and Ramanujan. Then he goes on to differentiate between pure and trivial mathematics while calling the whole field of mathematics harmless (cos according to him Science, which borrows a lot of things from math but is not actual math, does more harm than good). He makes his point by using war as an example. Talking about examples, the book uses a lot of simple examples to make the reader understand his pov. The last few chapters were sort of autobiographical in a way, which I really enjoyed. On the whole, the book felt like a conversation - it was fairly easy to follow and can be read in a day."
35,0521427061,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62759729-ash,4,"I saw ""The Man who Knew Infinity"", and subsequently fell down a Ramanujan/GH Hardy rabbit hole that led me to this book. GH Hardy was a well-known mathematician who was the mentor of Srinivasa Ramanujan. He was also an introspective eccentric. When I read the initial reviews of this book, I encountered some criticisms that centered around the fact that Hardy was, more or less, full of himself. Hardy accepts this fact early on in the book, ""...my defence of mathematics will be a defence of myself, and that my apology is bound to be to some extent egotistical. I should not think it worth while to apologize for my subject if I regarded myself as one of its failures. "" He proceeds to defend this ""arrogance"" as confidence, stating that ""A man who is always asking 'Is what I do worth while?' and 'Am I the right person to do it?' will always be ineffective himself and a discouragement to others. He must shut his eyes a little and think a little more of his subject and himself..."". Good advice that is applicable to anyone undertaking a difficult task. P. 1: There is no scorn more profound, or on the whole more justifiable, than that of the men who make for the men who explain. Exposition, criticism, appreciation, is work for second-rate minds. P. 3: ...my defence of mathematics will be a defence of myself, and that my apology is bound to be to some extent egotistical. I should not think it worth while to apologize for my subject if I regarded myself as one of its failures. P. 3: Good work is not done by 'humble' men. It is one of the first duties of a professor, for example, in any subject, to exaggerate a little both the importance of his subject and his own importance in it. A man who is always asking 'Is what I do worth while?' and 'Am I the right person to do it?' will always be ineffective himself and a discouragement to others. He must shut his eyes a little and think a little more of his subject and himself than they deserve. This is not too difficult: it is harder not to make his subject and himself ridiculous by shutting his eyes too tightly.P. 4: A man who sets out to justify his existence and his activities to distinguish two different questions. The first is whether the work which he dose is worth doing; and the second is why he does it, whatever its value may be. The first question is often very difficult, and the answer very discouraging, but most people will find the second easy enough even then. Their answers, if they are honest, will usually take one or other of two forms; and the second form is merely a humbler variation of the first, which is the only answer we need consider seriously. P. 4: ...most people can do nothing well...If a man has any genuine talent he should be ready to make almost any sacrifice in order to cultivate it to the full. P. 9: ...to have produced anything of the slightest permanent interest, whether it be a copy of verses or a geometrical theorem, is to have done something utterly beyond the powers of the vast majority of men. P. 10: A man's first duty, a young man's at any rate, is to be ambitious. Ambition is a noble passion which may legitimately take many forms...P. 10: We must guard against a fallacy common among apologist of science, the fallacy of supposing that the men whose work most benefits humanity are thinking much of that while they do it...P. 11: There are many highly respected motivates which may lead men to prosecute research, but three which are much more important than the rest. The first...is intellectual curiosity, desire to know the truth. Then, professional pride - anxiety to be satisfied with one's performance, the shame that overcomes any self-respecting craftsman when his work is unworthy of his talent. Finally, ambition - desire for reputation, and the position, even the power or the money, which it brings. It may be fine to feel, when you have done your work, that you have added to the happiness or alleviated the sufferings of others, but that will not be why you did it. P. 12: Archimedes will be remembered when Aeschylus is forgotten, because languages die and mathematical ideas do not. 'Immortality' may be a silly word, but probably a mathematician has the best chance of whatever it may mean. P. 13: A mathematician, like a painter or poet, is a maker of patterns. P. 13: Beauty is the first test: there is no permanent place in the world for ugly mathematics. P. 15: Chess problems are the hymn-tunes of mathematics. P. 39: The great modern achievements of applied mathematics have been in relativity and quantum mechanics, and these subjects are, at present at any rate, almost as 'useless' as the theory of numbers...Time may change all this. No one foresaw the application of matrices and groups and other purely mathematical theories to modern physics, and it may be that some of the 'highbrow' applied mathematics will become 'useful' in as unexpected a way; but the evidence so far points to the conclusion that, in one subject as in the other, it is what is commonplace and dull that counts for practical life. P. 43: There are then two mathematics. There is the real mathematics of the real mathematicians, and there is what I call the 'trivial' mathematics, for want of a better word. The trivial mathematics may be justified by arguments which would appeal to Hogben, or other writers of his school, but there is no such defence for the real mathematics, which must be justified as arts if it can be justified at all. There is nothing in the least paradoxical or unusual in this view, which is that held commonly by mathematicians.P. 45: Mathematics is, of all the arts and sciences, the most austere and the most remote, and a mathematician should be of all men the one who can most easily take refuge where, as Bertrand Russell says, 'one at least of our nobler impulses can best escape from the dreary exile of the actual world'."

Beauty is the first test: there is no permanent place in the world for ugly mathematics."" I thoroughly enjoyed Hardy's ""A Methematician's Apology"". A hauntingly timeless piece, giving an accessible account of the point of real mathematics which doesn't just rely on downstream applications, told in an engaging and eloquent style. It is amazing to think that this was written in 1940, so long before significant demand for popular maths and science that we know today.C.P Snow's biography at the beginning of the book was very moving. I strongly identified with the sensitivity and fragility with which he portrayed Hardy, the account thoroughly humanised a mathematician's whose life works seem remote and austere and very intimidating to non-matematicians. Hearing the story of Hardy's collaboration with Ramanujan is an uplifting one, I feel that only someone who touches upon genius themselves would have been able to recognise it from such an unexpected source. The modesty and emotion of the biography warmed me greatly to Hardy's character. I was also pleased to learn that he and Littlewood were instrumental in changing the university exam system to reward mathematical creativity and understanding rather than horrendous mechanical computations. A great credit to English academia - and my husband's career!As for Hardy's essay, I found it passionate and illuminating. His focus on the beauty of pure mathematics was greatly gratifying. I enjoyed his examples of great mathematics, Euclid's proof of infinite primes and Pythagoras' proof of the irrationality of square root 2. I have fond memories of encountering these proofs whilst in my teens and still remember the almost tangible mental expansion that following these great arguments caused in me. His descriptions of abstraction and generality as they apply to mathematics are also impressive as these must be some of the most difficult concepts to understand linguistically. His broad intelligence really sparkles as he is able to draw on literature and philosophy throughout to enrich his argument.I would definitely recommend this book to any young person interested in maths, especially if they are bored with what they have been taught in school. This is a timeless classic, and a great addition to conceptual literature as well as a pioneer in popular mathematics.PS. Top points for LGBTQ+ representation.  ""... he had scattered through his life, two or three relationships, different in kind. These were intense affections, absorbing, non-physical but exalted. The one I knew about was for a young man whose nature was as spiritually delicate as his own.""  I'm always glad to find another inspirational gay icon."
38,0521427061,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61942186-alexander-eubanks,5,"Recently re-read this actually. An incredibly candid exposition of a life as a mathematician. Particularly sad overall, which is a plus to me, and also one of THE books which has contributed to me taking the plunge into pure mathematics. That said, one needn't know, understand, or even like any amount of mathematics in order to appreciate this, as it is first and foremost a reflection on the value of a life which is (in the eyes of the author) finished.It is difficult to go into detail about this book without merely quoting it all (which I will essentially do), but it is Hardy's own reflections on his life and career. (He is the mathematician who brought Ramanujan over to trinity college and mentored him. Hardy even says: ""I still say to myself when I am depressed, and find myself forced to listen to pompous and tiresome people, 'Well, I have done one thing you could never have done, and that is to have collaborated with both Littlewood and Ramanujan on something like equal terms.’ "").Again, he doesn't go into his own mathematics very much, but rather he ""defends"" mathematics, especially Pure mathematics, and why it is worth studying. I especially like this passage:""If intellectual curiosity, professional pride, and ambition are the dominant incentives to research, then assuredly no one has a fairer chance of satisfying them than a mathematician. His subject is the most curious of all—there is none in which truth plays such odd pranks. It has the most elaborate and the most fascinating technique, and gives unrivaled openings for the display of sheer professional skill. Finally, as history proves abundantly, mathematical achievement, whatever its intrinsic worth, is the most enduring of all. ""Additionally, he goes into what his life has been like, and if it has all been worth it or not. It's an incredibly sad book as well, as he starts off: ""It is a melancholy experience for a professional mathematician tofind himself writing about mathematics. The function of amathematician is to do something, to prove new theorems, to addto mathematics, and not to talk about what he or other mathematicians have done. ...If then I find myself writing, not mathematics, but ‘about’ mathematics, it is a confession of weakness, for which I may rightly be scorned or pitied by younger and more vigorous mathematicians. I write about mathematics because, like any other mathematician who has passed sixty, I have no longer the freshness of mind, the energy, or the patience to carry on effectively with my proper job.""I, for one, am glad he still deigned to write this, because it humanized mathematics for me, and I, being me, needed this to be done with a generous dose of grey."
39,0521427061,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2822398-avinash,4,"This was short but a satisfying and extremely stimulating read. The premise of this letter that G.H.Hardy wrote as his mathematical prowess was declining, was to answer the question ""Why is it worthwhile to do a serious study of Mathematics?"". In fact in this question and most of the ensuing arguments Hardy makes, Mathematics can be replaced by any 'creative art'. I say this loosely as Mathematics is not considered practical enough to be regarded as equal with other sciences but at the same time not abstract enough to be regarded as a creative art.Consider the following two questions: The work/profession I am doing; is it worth doing? and 'Why' do we do it? In fact any one who considers a justification to their existence would have pondered along these lines. It was a mental treat to read the arguments made by Hardy from his point of view i.e. of a Mathematician. They were brutally honest and even though they made me depressed initially, I was left with a new perspective to think about the purpose and direction of my existence.Few quotes I liked: ""If a man has any genuine talent, he should be ready to do almost any sacrifice in order to cultivate it to the full""paraphrasing a little... ""There are three motives, more important than the others, which may lead many a men to pursue research: 1) Intellectual curiosity 2) Professional pride, anxiety to be satisfied of his performance and a shame that accompanies any self-respecting craftsman when the work is unworthy of his talent and 3) finally Ambition, desire for reputation, even the power or money which it brings.""""So if a mathematician or a chemist or a physiologist were to tell me that the driving force behind his work is the desire to benefit humanity, then I would not believe them (nor would I think any better of them if I did) ""Old edit: I hope to come back and write a detailed review of this poignant and thought provoking apology for mathematics and mathematicians, or any creative artist for that matter; from G.H. Hardy one of the most eminent pure mathematicians of this past century."
40,0521427061,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7938558-tapasya,5,"I think I've grown as a scientist/researcher after reading this book. I would give this book 6 stars if I could. It is indeed a beautiful read, very well-balanced, and one of the best essays I've read on theory versus practice in science. My reactions went from ""what a snob"" to ""I completely disagree with you"" to ""how humble and honest"" to ""yeah, I've been in denial"". I cannot believe that one person can do justice to all of those feelings in under 100 pages. My favorite chapters are 7, 15, 26-29; and the final note. Some interesting thought-provoking ideas from the book:
A man who is always asking 'Is what I do worth while?' and 'Am I the right person to do it?' will always be ineffective himself and a discouragement to others. He must shut his eyes a little and think a little more of his subject and himself than they deserve. This is not too difficult: it is harder not to make his subject and himself ridiculous by shutting his eyes too tightly. Even if we grant that 'Archimedes will be remembered when Aeschylus is forgotten', is not mathematical fame a little too 'anonymous' to be wholly satisfying? We could form a fairly coherent picture of the personality of Aeschylus (still more, of course, of Shakespeare or Tolstoi) from their works alone, while Archimedes and Eudoxus would remain mere names.There are many highly respectable motives which may lead men to prosecute research, but three which are much more important than the rest. The first (without which the rest must come to nothing) is intellectual curiosity, desire to know the truth. Then, professional pride, anxiety to be satisfied with one's performance, the shame that overcomes any self-respecting craftsman when his work is unworthy of his talent. Finally, ambition, desire for reputation, and the position, even the power or the money, which it brings. It may be fine to feel, when you have done your work, that you have added to the happiness or alleviated the sufferings of others, but that will not be why you did it. So if a mathematician, or a chemist, or even a physiologist, were to tell me that the driving force in his work had been the desire to benefit humanity, then I should not believe him (nor should I think the better of him if I did). His dominant motives have been those which I have stated, and in which, surely, there is nothing of which any decent man need be ashamed.
"
41,0521427061,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4975321-joseph,5,"Hardy's words are heartbreakingly beautiful enough, but with the introduction by CP Snow it becomes something much more human, and sad, than Hardy alone would give you. Certainly it shouldn't only be read as a tragedy or an elegy to Hardy's younger, mathematical self, and it's a wonderfully articulate and full-throated defense of mathematics done for its own sake, without any need or even desire for ""useful applications"". And as such it's still desperately needed even today when math is seen most often as a strange esoteric ""language"" only used by engineers and scientists to do incomprehensible things. Hardy's clear love for it as a painting of ideas mounted on an eternal, timeless, and universally accessible landscape is, hopefully, something that can make even the person most ground down by the drudgery of the soulless math taught in K-12 can see something of why anybody would even consider doing something like this for fun or with passion.But at the same time, as Snow makes abundantly clear, it's also Hardy in mourning as much as Hardy as jubilant evangelist. Writing as he did when he knew all too well that his mathematical powers had failed him, that he would never create something nearly as beautiful as what he had in his heights of collaboration with Littlewood and Ramanujan, he turned to writing about mathematics as a despised second-rate form of writing which nevertheless was the closest he could still come to the beauty he could no longer access with any skill. And with Snow's touching biography of Hardy casting a pall over the book, it's hard not to read its superficially professorial tone and self-conscious pride as also tinged with a melancholy and sadness and crushing loss. I'd always viewed Hardy mainly as the man who finally, of a group of potentially qualified people, managed not to overlook Ramanujan's substantial talent, and bring him into the mathematical world and honors that by rights should have been his long ago. Hardy as a person was mainly interesting for the personal quirks that allowed him to recognize Ramanujan where his less-aware countrymen failed utterly. But he was in some ways a tragic romantic figure in his own right. Though I knew him as the man who introduced the world to Ramanujan, Ramanujan introduced him to me. "
42,0521427061,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48775114-alice,3,"In this piece, dedicated to illustrate the author's passion for mathematics, Hardy begins the narration by giving for granted maths' supreme importance and utility, which he believes everyone must objectively agree upon. On the contrary today most would define mathematics as the most unpopular of subjects, and for no logic reason. Admitted the hardship and complexity of its processes, just as any other field it requires an attentive study of the theory and hours of practice to solve its problems. Nonetheless, people rarely have a likeness for maths and in time this has made it the unfavorable subject in school. Today one is greeted with approval if he complains about having maths homework or hating his maths class with stronger fervor than if he were talking about any other subject. A student who chooses to graduate in maths at university is more likely to receive surprised glances and disbelieving or even disapproving stares and questions; while a philosophy/economy/biology major rarely receives a similar treatment. But why does this happen? Why does this specific science stand out so strongly against all others?Hardy does a pretty job in presenting exactly the aspects which he believes distinguish mathematics from other sciences, however his argument is not one which seems to be convincing for a maths-hater. The ideas which make him fonder appear to be the same that might encourage the detachment of non-mathematicians. In my opinion the reason for this is most often a lack of a proper preparation at a young age, which leaves students unprepared in later years of education, and after all struggling with a subject has never made it more appealing. Additionally, given its common conception, nowadays it seems socially easier to dislike maths than to have a fondness for it.But if individuals with kindredness to maths were rare in the first place this hatred towards it serves as further discouragement to all those who have a slight inclination for it and pushes into secrecy those who truly find it a fascinating topic. I for one, am not ashamed of my fondness for maths. And neither is Godfrey Harold Hardy, the proudest of mathematicians, who uses this entire piece to express his love and lifelong dedication to this science."

No discovery of mine has made, or is likely to make, directly or indirectly, for good or ill, the least difference to the amenity of the world."" - G. H. HardyHardy was a mentor and confidant of the great mathematician Ramanujan and was a great mathematician in his own right. His mild manners belied his idiosyncrasy and appreciation of genius, and this book is a representation of that. Hardy discusses the worth and weight of mathematics as a creative endeavour that is also distinct from the challenges of other creative endeavours such as poetry and literature. Purpose and aesthetics, he says, are both equal participants in the magic of mathematics, and mathematicians seek both.Hardy casually discusses the endeavour of mathematics and creative professions, and identifies one key problem in creative work - that a lot of it is done when you're young. There are lots of antitheses to this idea in the here and the now, and many examples to the contrary in the 20th and 21st century, but some things he says do ring true, if only true for a different time. There is a section of the book where he covers mathematical elegance in theorems and proofs and demonstrations of reductio ad absurdum in simple theorems in geometry and number theory, which is characterised by simple and beautiful explanations. A far cry from the clumsy writing style of later decades, there is an elegance in his prose and narrative, suffused with great ideas and high thinking. Definitely worth a read for anyone with a passing interest in mathematicians, mathematics and how mathematicians think. In fact, since we're in an age where the most powerful nation on earth is party to silly debates about whether mathematics, science and game development, computer programming are creative endeavours, it is important to understand what mathematical rock stars of yesteryear like Hardy have to say about mathematics as a creative endeavour."
44,0521427061,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21155710-maria,4,"How wonderful it is to contact with passionate people! Or, in this case, someone who claims to no longer be passionate, but still transpires passion in his speech. I have always had a penchant for what makes people tick.How delightful to read about the beauty of mathematical patterns, the harmonious way in which ideas ought to fit together, about the seriousness of a theorem and the significance of the ideas which it connects, about the permanence of mathematical achievement and what makes a good problem. How whetting to follow the reasoning behind theorems of the highest class, and consider what the 'purely aesthetical' qualities of such theorems are (unexpectedness, inevitability, economy).To read such well structured ideas, such a crystalline and sound reasoning, is truly refreshing. The way Hardy defends his field, even though he does it in a strictly rational and unsentimental way which may not please some, his thoughts on why mathematics is worth it and in which ways it is superior to other fields, his passion, for lack of better word, made me truly enjoy this book. Notwithstanding, I disagree with many of Hardy's points. Two examples: the idea that most people can't do anything well strikes me as gratuitious; the same for the idea that men who make scorn the men who explain, as I know men who excell at both, and value the explaining as well as the making.Mathematics is indeed a matchless field, one of the most praised, feared and misunderstood. That intellectual 'kick' provided best by a problem - mathematicians know it better than anyone else. I cannot aspire to transpose the field of 'trivial' mathematics and reach the 'real' mathematics of the 'real' mathematicians; my specific abilities do not lie that way. I am not given to properly explore the mathematical reality, yet it fascinates me. To read an apology where my fascination is validated and logically justified is invigorating."
45,0521427061,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33462912-rohit-goswami,5,"This is a fantastic read. It is astonishing to resonate so well with a mathematician from so many years ago. I do believe he would be disappointed in the world we have today; and would be especially surprised by the world-wide resurgence of interest in engineering disciplines like ""heavy wool"". That aside, this is a book everyone should read. It is hard to imagine but this book made me smile, cringe and even chuckle aloud. It has aged perfectly. The foreward is perfect as well. The passion Hardy has for mathematics is really relatable, as is his pain at his diminishing capabilities. I will read this several times more in my lifetime, and expect it to be as profoundly moving as I did this time."

The edition contains a 50 page Foreword by C.P. Snow followed by the 90 page book by Hardy (actually, adjusting for different font sizes, the two parts are probably about equal in length). I read the book first so that I could think about it on its own terms and the Foreword afterwords. Both of them are outstanding and I would recommend reading them in that same reverse order.Hardy wrote A Mathematician's Apology in the twilight of his career when he no longer was a creative, productive mathematician--and one of the many apologies in the book is the very notion of writing about what mathematics rather than actually doing mathematics. He conveys an enormous love and wonder for the discipline, illustrates it with sketches of some proofs, reflects back on his own work and his partnerships with Ramanujan and Littlewood, and discusses the purpose or lack thereof for mathematics. The book itself beautifully conveys the creativity and beauty of mathematics and the process and drive that leads people to do it.C.P. Snow's Foreword is a mini-biography of Hardy, the almost novelistic story of Snow's friendship with Hardy (which begins and ends with discussions of cricket, starting when they met in the dining hall at Cambridge and ending on Hardy's deathbed), and a critical appreciation of A Mathematician's Apology."

Snow, it gave the book more sense and I could understand more subtleties hidden in the actual book. When I started the part by G. H. Hardy, I got stuck by the openness of the book. He was not hiding under the finger and just said what he thought was true. I have to confess that some of his ideas where a little extreme for and I don't agree with them, but the book made me think about how much the political situation at the moment was influencing the research done in mathematics. In addition, he book described so good the journey of a genius who believed he was not really that good, that he hasn't accomplished much in life but he enjoyed his job. This quote explains much about this book: ""The case of my life, then, or for that of any one else who has been a mathematician in the same sense in which I have been one, is this: that I have added something to knowledge, and helped others to add more; and that these somethings have a value which differs in degree only, and not in kind, from that of the creations of the great mathematicians, or of any of the other artists, great or small, who have left some kind of memorial behind them."" "
48,0521427061,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28016064-vignesh,5,"I enjoyed reading the foreword by Snow as much as I enjoyed reading Hardy. If Hardy could pen prose that's so delightful, I can only imagine how pleasurable it would be to read his mathematics. Unfortunately, I'm not quite equipped to understand nor appreciate finer mathematics than what Hardy refers to as trivial problems. It was interesting to get an insight into what he thought of mathematics, his work in it, and of himself. Like Snow mentions multiple times in the foreword, Hardy seems to be one of the most self aware of all people. He knows when to claim importance, and when to be humble, all without it being on your face. He seems to have regretted growing old and losing control of his faculties -- evident from the fact that he tried to kill himself -- which is very sad to read about. He seems like someone who would have loved to die doing what he loved - solving the next creative problem, or enjoying the day's cricket match. Unfortunately, that was not the case.The one thing he seems to hate more than growing old is war; which is completely justified. He hated that math was of assistance in war, rather than just helping society. But as he rightly claims, there is little beauty in an art that contributes to destruction."
49,0521427061,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18942380-william-schram,4,"In this very slim volume, Professor G. H. Hardy talks about what mathematics means to him and to society as a whole. Written with a preface dated 18 July 1940, I assume it came out before the horrors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, so I can understand Professor Hardy speaking of relativity as having no real use. When I speak of use, I speak of value. Value means that it has an application of some kind in our society. Many mathematical ideas don't really have value in that sense, but are interesting to a select few.So in a sense, Professor Hardy is defending his profession and himself. Many people remember Archimedes, Newton, Galileo, Einstein and far too many others to count. Take Rolle for instance, he found some theorem in Calculus and is now remembered. Hardy states that the stuff he did as a mathematician was mediocre at best. Sure he discovered Ramanujan and collaborated with Littlewood, but aside from that he had no real discoveries. So I suppose that is where the title comes from; he is apologizing for mathematics as a whole.It is an interesting account of a man's life in mathematics, and I thought it was quite nice. Four out of five."

Hardy and is followed by a from-the-heart essay by Hardy about mathematics from his perspective as a self-proclaimed ""real"" mathematician of pure mathematics (as opposed to a mathematician of what he calls trivial mathematics). He wrote the apology in 1940 as he approached the twilight of his life, and past the time of his life when he confesses there is any creativity left in him. Ironically the creation of his essay was as endearing a story to read by a peripheral practicer of mathematics as I'm assuming his younger years' creative inventions and tales of his professorial instruction of the mathematical arts would be to career mathematicians. It is a short and enjoyable book about, and by, a mathematician I'd not studied previously but whom I feel as if I know somewhat through this combination history and commencement-esque essay."

On the one hand the talk about the usefulness and uselessness of such an undeniably desirable field of science, so called math, was so good that made me think about the concept of the entity called mathematics. And on the other hand the bare consideration of science vs. war, and math vs. the reason to study it, should pin in mind that science and specifically math is not solely what we're being taught at school as what makes everybody's parents proud. Hardy was somehow trying to make us think of what we're doing, and why us math lovers, study math.Not to mention that the conclusion at the end was a good rest for my mind after considering all of the different aspects of the subject throughout the book.After all, as a math lover, I totally enjoyed."

Because although he became an Oxford don and left something permanent in the field of pure mathematics, he did nothing to improve the life of others. It was a selfish life because he loved the creative process and was fortunate enough that it brought him the other measures of success. The book was worth reading again to get another glimpse of his logical mind at work in what is more a justification than an apology. Although he uses some ""simple"" math examples to illustrate a point, it is not necessary to understand them precisely (nor need you apologize for skipping them). "

60,0521427061,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5669366-larry,4,"A thoughtful and eloquent essay about what it means to contribute to the world, whether one is a poet or a mathematician. The ""apology"" refers to the fact that, in his own assessment, he created nothing world-changing like Einstein or Newton, while at the same time he acknowledges to himself that he has contributed, even in a small way, to the evolution of human knowledge and development.What we do may be small, but it has a certain character of permanence; and to have produced anything of the slightest permanent interest, whether it be a copy of verses or a geometrical theorem, is to have done something utterly beyond the powers of the vast majority of men.Of course, his scholarly elitism shows through even in this quote. His use of the term men may be the generic usage, but I couldn't help but form the wee impression that he truly believed that art and mathematics are entirely male endeavors. He also asserts that 95 percent of humanity make no lasting contribution to the universe, and implies that those who do tend to be academics...which is awfully elitist, though I see his point (except about academics; Frank Zappa said, ""The longer you stay in school, the stupider you get,"" which I heartily agree with, and maybe explains Hardy's thesis in the next paragraph).The only premise that truly bothered me was his justification for writing this essay in the first place: his often-repeated assertion that at age sixty, he (or indeed anyone of that age) has nothing left to contribute to the world, nor even the capability of doing so, that our minds and creativity are worn down to the nub, and that one has nothing else left to do but look backwards and write a little essay such as this one, the end. Sure, examples abound of artists, mathematicians and scientists all having their biggest, profoundest breakthroughs before they turn 40. But there are enough examples of such creators who continue to innovate and produce fresh material well into old age, with their lifetime of knowledge and experience as a base, not an anchor. Such examples do not show up in his thesis.But ignore the anachronisms. It's a short read, with much food for thought and an enthusiastic endorsement of the importance of mathematical knowledge. Now I feel even stupider for having failed high school algebra. Twice."

Justification of aesthetic beauty in mathematics is an erudite and esoteric effort. He avoids diving into certain intellectual clefts, to my dismay as he seems capable of clear and knowledgeable discussion of the Peano Axioms. At no point is this drowned by technical terms, 'natural language' really does seem to have been accessible to a professional mathematician, how's that?! The Beginning of Infinity seems like the closest book to this that I have read. That is much broader and deeper but less humane than this. "

Rather than saving the world, egocentrism is the true motive. It is illustrated that an intelligent person should not live the life of mediocrity, and one should ultimately be willing to give it all to change the perception of the existing reality. “It is not worth an intelligent man's time to be in the majority. By definition, there are already enough people to do that.”The idea of aesthetics heavily influences his work. He challenges the idea of what truly matters and is worth the pursuit. For him, the elegance in a proof of a theorem is as important as something less exotic but rather useful. The art of doing mathematics lies between the linings of the usefulness and the pure aesthetic aspect of the matter. “A mathematician, like a painter or a poet, is a maker of patterns. If his patterns are more permanent than theirs, it is because they are made with ideas”."

The passion for mathematics that is felt throughout the film led me to search more about the life of both Hardy and Ramanujan. Et c’est comme ça, that I agreeably arrived at “A mathematician’s apology”. There are many captivating things regarding the collaboration of Hardy and Ramanujan, one of them being the humility of the professor to recognize geniusness from a non-traditional source. The professor, a recognized mathematician himself, emerged to me as an intriguing character that I needed to meet through the immortality of his words. The Apology is a book that reveals a profound love for the creative powers of mathematics, the beauty of ideas and the curiosity of the intellect. The concluding remarks of a man who dedicated his life to that which he loved. With a beautifully crafted foreword by C.P. Snow, the Apology takes us back to Cambridge and the ideas of a nothing but extraordinary man. "

Hardy, first published in 1940, which ""acts as a pithy argument against suicide."" Hmm, I thought, perfect bedtime reading.Unfortunately (for me) the most interesting part of the book is its introduction by C.P. Snow, who makes Hardy more interesting than he does himself. Three parts stood out: His life remained the life of a brilliant young man until he was old: so did his spirit: his games, his interests, kept the lightness of a young don's. And, like many men who keep a young man's interests into their sixties, his last years were the darker for it.So that's something to look forward to.Snow also recalls a key point of tension between him and Hardy, which recalled the central argument of Peter Watson's The German Genius.Like many of his Edwardian intellectual friends, he had a strong feeling for Germany. Germany had, after all, been the great educating force of the nineteenth century. To Eastern Europe, to Russia, to the United States, it was the German universities which had taught the meaning of research. Hardy hadn't much use for German philosophy or German literature: his tastes were too classical for that. But in most respects the German culture, including its social welfare, appeared to him higher than his own.Finally there's the account of Hardy's botched suicide in the wake of a coronary thrombosis, the death of a close friend, and the irruption of the Second World War. Hardy swallowed a handful of barbiturates, then vomited them up, blacking his eye on the edge of the toilet. Snow tried to cheer him up. ""I talked about other distinguished failures at bringing off suicide."" Hardy promised not to try again. ""He wasn't good at it.""After this, the Apology itself is a bit dull, although it does support Snow's observation that he was ""utterly free from moral vanity."" On the other hand, Hardy can be superbly astringent. Good work is not done by ""humble"" men… most people can do nothing at all well… perhaps five or even ten per cent of men can do something rather well. It is a tiny minority who can do anything really well, and the number of men who can do two things well is negligible. If a man has any genuine talent, he should be ready to make almost any sacrifice in order to cultivate it to the full… Ambition has been the driving force behind nearly all the best work of the world.Hardy believes he followed his own maxim – by his account he was a first-rate mathematician and not much else. Aspects of this Apology sound almost archaic; in my view, the best parts.___________* My other favorite is the Guardian's Top 10s."
70,0521427061,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3190862-sutapa-bhattacharya,3,"When I heard about this book, my initial thought was ""Why should a mathematician apologize in the first place?"" The ""apology"" turned out to be a justification of pure - or ""real"" mathematics and its practitioners, not a mathematician kneeling down asking for forgiveness. The question remains, however - why justify something as beautiful and as fundamental as mathematics?I am an engineer. I have never have had anything to do with pure mathematics. In any case I do not understand the difference between pure and applied mathematics. I know only a tiny amount of utilitarian mathematics, for which Hardy does not seem to have much time and sympathy. Real mathematics have beauty and purity of some other level, it seems from his writing. I regret that I am never going to know or appreciate that kind of mathematics. However, anyone who looks closely at the worldly phenomenons with a curious eye can see that mathematics is the language in which the universe speaks. If there is just one thing that absolutely does not need a defence, it has to be mathematics.Hardy seemed keen to show that pure mathematics is useless, and it has no use in modern warfare. I was surprised to find that he had given the example of number theory as something useless. Number theory has lots of application in computer science and technology, and of course nowadays everything, including modern warfare is controlled by computers. Then I remembered that of course Hardy did not live to see this day. Is it the fault of science that is used for destructive purposes instead of constructive ones? I think not. Science is neither good nor bad. It is just the way the universe works. It is up to the humans to choose whether or not they want to use scientific knowledge for destruction.The idea that mathematical theorems have always been there, and those who propose and prove them, simply make some observation of something existing, is beautiful. The truth is supreme and ultimate. It stays irrespective of the presence of an observer.Overall though I was not very sure why this book needed to be written in the first place (perhaps because I do not understand the turmoil of the time when Hardy, a hardcore pacifist, lived, and because I am not a part of his target audience since I strongly believe that any field of science should be pursued for its own sake rather than for the sake of its applications), but I enjoyed reading the thoughts of the crystal-clear and razor-sharp mind of one of the finest mathematicians, and his lucid explanations of a few mathematical theorems. The preface by physical chemist and novelist C.P. Snow depicts Hardy's heart-warming life story that ended in sadness and regrets, inevitable for any genius who is past the mental ability of their prime."
71,0521427061,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59353241-shozab-qasim,5,"It is without little doubt, one of the finest 'apologies' a Mathematician could write in defence of his work. But most of these 'opinions' are just that, opinions and point of views of a time long gone. There are many points of contention which most modern day men will have with Hardy, primarily with regards to his conceptions of 'pure' and 'applied' mathematics. He is quite courteous to the Physicist when he considers the works of Relativity and Quantum Mechanics to be examples of Mathematics, but he regards them as 'useless' subjects, that is, they have no 'practical value'. He makes the same case for branches of Mathematics like number theory. Any man of the modern century will realise how outdated these views are, considering especially the practicality and usage of these field in the modern day world. Number Theory for instance has found practical applications in public key cryptography, Relativity in the development of the GPS system and Quantum Mechanics in nearly everything our world is built on. The fact of the matter is this, even some of the most useless disciplines of Mathematics will find 'practical' use. The distinction between pure and applied mathematics is also a sort of mental construction. Furthermore, it is difficult to associate utility with pure subjects, for only time can tell which subject remain inapplicable to the real world. It has often been the case however, that many useless areas of knowledge have found very practical usages. One would be sympathetic however, in understanding that the 'practical' reason is never the motivation for satisfying intellectual curiosity. The entire essay can be thought of as a declaration of surrender. Hardy considers his age to be the reason why he can no longer make any great discovery, it is surprising to think he would have this view, especially when he made major contributions with Ramanujan and Littlewood at an age far greater than the mythical 'blooming' age of the Mathematician. One can't help but feel then that the essay is then, another deplorable depiction of the pitiful art of self depreciation. In the end, it is quite wonderful to look into the minds of one of the finest intellects 20th century Mathematics has known. But one must not take such outdated views too seriously. They must be regarded as matters of history and should remain that, history."
72,0521427061,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2348903-greg-talbot,3,"Math reentered my world, when I encountered databases. The logic to them makes a lot of sense, but as i've unpeeled the potato, I've seen that the real power is in relational algebra. Like anything worthwhile, there is more to study, and nothing fits more than a reading a universally beloved ""math books"".G.H. Hardy's ""A Mathematician's Apology"" can be read without a math background, an intuition for problem solving or a Cambridge education. In a bewildering 50 page forward by C.P. Snow, the reader gains appreciation for Hardy's contribution and eminence. Why this is 1/3 of the book's, I don't know. It's almost like Nabokov's ""Pale Fire"", where you get more interested in the footnotes than the story at hand (except Nabokov's narrator is sinister, sly and manipulative, and probably not too hot on mathematics). Anyway, the forward sets up the reader for what could be a very interesting read. Clearly Hardy is well versed in mathematics. His spirit is one of cooperation and egalitarian, as evidence by his groundbreaking work with Ramanujan and raising awareness of his student's gift.What follows in Hardy's work is something of well-prepared lecture, sprinkled with some interesting thoughts on the theorems. I admire how he presents several math theorems, and breakdown just how significant they are. ""Euclid's theorem is vital vital for the whole structure of arithmetic. The primes are the raw material out of which we have to build arithmetic"". He describes the purity of mathematics, the mathematical realm, which may exist in our imagination or as a parallel reality. Let me take issue with Hardy's humility, or attempt to ground the reader. Often he writes about how mathematics has very little practical importance - hence ""the apology"". Maybe it has it's place in the book, but I found it deflating the balloon a little bit. I gained some appreciation for Euclid and Hardy's thoughts on elegance. Clearly in databases, programming, or any science, elegance is real even if hard to define. There was enough to keep me interested in Hardy's work, but I think he could have done a lot more with it."
73,0521427061,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25338445-angie-reisetter,4,"As a piece of primary history, this is a fascinating read. Hardy is so very British, so much the mathematician, so early 20th century, and so very male. Of course there are things I disagree with him about. But the book itself was intriguing as a snapshot of a prominent mathematical mind. And I really enjoyed C.P. Snow's introduction, which was 1/3 of the book. There were some things that made me laugh out loud. For instance, Hardy's repeated claim that really, the vast majority of people are no good at anything. I don't think that would win him a popularity contest. And from my scientist's point of view, his claim that ""'imaginary' universes are so much more beautiful that this stupidly constructed 'real' one"" got an explosive laugh. Yep, he pretty much nailed the difference between math and science. That's it right there.One of Hardy's points that particularly grabbed my attention was his eulogy of ambition as the motivation behind any great work in any field. It is the highest virtue. He claims that he simply doesn't believe that a man would do something great in service to others, that it's really about leaving your mark on history. I completely believe that was his point of view. As a female scientist, I've heard all sorts of guesses about why there are few women in science, particularly in math and physics, from people with varying degrees of expertise. One of the few that sound at all reasonable to me is that women, in general, tend to value doing some good for others with their careers more than men do. This is extremely general, and may be only cultural as far as I know. But I was reminded of this when I read Hardy's pages on what motivates men to excel (yes, he was only talking about men). I don't think he represents all men, of course, but the claim was strikingly masculine. Anyway, it made me go hmmmmm.But in the end, did he successfully defend mathematics as a worthwhile discipline, and his role in it as important? I'm actually not sure he did, given today's culture. But I find what he considered to be a successful argument fascinating."
74,0521427061,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3030419-fraser-kinnear,4,"The C.P. Snow introduction, which was nearly as long as the Apology itself, was a fantastic inclusion, as it provided context which I felt really brought me closer to Hardy. Without it, I think, I would have found Hardy to have been a bit too full of himself, as he feels dismissive of perspectives other than his own. Having said that, Hardy is very sensible in explaining the limits of his ability to explain his thoughts, and admits that he is unqualified to approach topics like the aesthetics of mathematics philosophically.I've come away really wishing that I had this book as part of a dialog, rather than a soliloquy which. I think that there is a lot of fertile ground here, especially in comparing his Platonism with other schools of thought at the time, which he must have been aware of, like Wittgenstein.Hardy's main point (I think) is that there are two types of mathematics: Real (academic, pure) and trivial (basic, simple, everyday). Trivial mathematics is applied to our lives and serves its purpose (and so is commonly known as applied mathematics). But real mathematics has almost no connection to our lives (outside of philosophy and some of the high sciences), even if it is describing a reality that Hardy, as a Platonist, believes is greater than the one we observe. Real mathematics, to Hardy, can only ""be justified as art if it can be justified at all.""This may be seen as a sad book, certainly. But I see Hardy's opinion of his own mortality (he committed suicide) as starkly inconsistent with his opinion of pure mathematics. Near the close of the book, Hardy admits ""It is plain now that my life, for what it is worth, is finished, and that nothing I can do can perceptibly increase or diminish its value."" What a shame that he considers his life finished because he can't increase its value. Hasn't he spent an entire book justifying (or at least enjoying) something which he admits to be useless? If Hardy saw his life the way he saw his mathematics, he would have spent the remainder of it enjoying himself, simply for his own sake."
75,0521427061,http://goodreads.com/user/show/955080-pang,3,"I heard about this book on NPR so I thought to check it out. The story is written by mathematician Godfrey Hardy, a man who is accredited for many number theory and and other mathematical analysis. The ""apology"" is actually more like an explanation of his passion for math and why he believes it's more ""pure"" than any other forms of science.The mass of mathematical truth is obvious and imposing; its practical applications, the bridges and steam-engines and dynamos, obtrude themselves on the dullest imagination. The public does not need to be convinced that there is something in mathematics.But he also feels that ""... the popular reputation of mathematics is based largely on ignorance and confusion, and that there is room for a more rational defence."" He says that his ""apology is bound to be to some extent egotistical."" He's not kidding about that!The whole book is a justification of his work... whether it is ""worth doing"" and ""why he does it."" Being both a (former) engineer and (now) a person who does a lot of math analysis, I found myself disagreeing with some of the things he had to say in the book. But it's undeniable the passion he has for math, and he obvious was good at it. The book definitely has a sad undertone to it, since Hardy has pretty much written the book toward the end of his life while he was sick.If then I find myself writing, not mathematics but 'about' mathematics, it is a confession of weakness, for which I may rightly be scorned or pitied by younger and more vigorous mathematicians. I write about mathematics because, like any other mathematician who has passed sixty, I have no longer the freshness of mind, the energy, or the patience to carry on effectively with my proper job.I find the book to drag on quite a bit, though it's still fascinating to read how a brilliant mind works."
76,0521427061,http://goodreads.com/user/show/362402-snehal-bhagat,3,"As everybody knows from personal experience, maths is no picnic, unless you're singularly gifted. And gifted mathematicians tend to be notoriously reclusive; it is rare that one as distinguished as Hardy should have undertaken an exercise such as this: a defense for mathematics. The subject is rather topical; if maths needed defending seventy years ago when the book was first published, it certainly does now, as governments strained for funds seek soft targets in academia. Which is odd, really, for there isn't any scientific discipline today that does not heavily involve mathematical methods, and in areas like theoretical physics, it is difficult to even see a clear separation between the two, so that it should be readily apparent will nothing will more effectively throttle scientific progress and thereby economic prosperity in the future than a current underinvestment in maths programs.The other distinction - that between 'pure' and 'applied' mathematics too was clearer during Hardy's time; and just in case it wasn't entirely obvious to the lay reader, Hardy explains: what 'first-rate' minds like himself did was 'pure' and what 'second-rate' minds - everyone else - did was 'applied'. He doesn't just explain it well, he does so often; belaboring the point so much that up until the time when he finally gets into a little mathematics, the foreword appears to be far more interesting than the book itself. But that's the only quibble I had with it; the rest, opinionated as it is, is a spirited and well-reasoned argument in favor of his craft.   "
77,0521427061,http://goodreads.com/user/show/307421-thomas-armstrong,3,"I bought a cheapo cheapo edition of this book (not the version above), which had more typos than I've ever seen in a book (it must have been proofread by a mathematician!). Hardy was sure an arrogant SOB, going by some of his arbitrary pronouncements: ''Good work is not done by humble men.'' (Gandhi, anyone?). ''....most people can do nothing at all well.'', ''A painting may embody an 'idea' but the idea is usually commonplace and unimportant.'' (Guernica, anyone?. On the other hand, some of those snobby quotes actually appealed to me, especially this one: ''...there is no scorn more profound, or on the whole more justifiable, than that of the men who make for the men who explain. Exposition, criticism, appreciation, is work for second-rate minds.'' I'm not a real fan of literary criticism. The stuff about higher mathematics being a young person's domain I knew from reading Gardner's Frames of Mind - this is partly where Gardner got the idea (he references Hardy several times in FOM). I appreciated Hardy's making the math examples simple enough that I could pretty much grasp if not entirely appreciate them. His own autobiographical notes are kind of a downer (he's hard on himself as well as other people), seeing himself as all washed up at age sixty-three (and he died seven years later). I think he needed a hobby! He also strengthens the belief of those who hold that people in math and science often don't have a lot of people skills (Baron-Cohen would say he was a ''systemizer'' not an ''empathizer.'') It was okay reading, but no great illuminations came to me from the book. I'm not a real mathematically-oriented person, however, so that may explain why."
78,0521427061,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30485647-kevin,3,"Hardy’s “Apology” is a quasi-autobiographic discussion of math, ideas and science. Hardy has a self-deprecating style which almost reaches the point of false modesty. During his lifetime, Hardy was considered one of the five most brilliant mathematicians in the world. His love for his subject – math, not himself – is evident; as is his sense of loss when he realizes he is too old to continue productive work. As difficult as this may be for some to believe (me for example), most cutting edge mathematics is done by those under 30 years of age. In fact, it is almost parallel with the life of a world-class athlete – demonstrate early potential (pre-teens), exceed your peers at an early age (pre-20’s), make your mark (pre-30’s), then (if you’re lucky) find others you can mentor and teach (post-30’s).But what happens when you don’t want to admit you don’t have it any move? Does it make you bitter, or just sad? Or maybe, a bit of both. This seems to be the case with Hardy. I found this book on the $2.00 rack at my local used-book store. I opened it and read the last two paragraphs which have been previously quoted, see: “Life’s Last Question” and “Something Of Value“. As I don’t personally share Hardy’s value system for evaluating one’s life, it is difficult for me to appreciate the sadness his words seem to relate, but I have enough empathy for him to appreciate his sense of gradual dissolution and fade into the unknown (death). And, it doesn’t hurt to be getting on in years myself."
79,0521427061,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4921346-basicallyrun,4,"I read this because I have vague hopes of writing a mathematician character at some point in the future and hoped it would help me understand some of the mindset. And it did. Some of it. I suspect I'm just too un-mathematical to get all of Hardy's points (especially the bits where he says 'This is a beautiful theorem. If you don't find it beautiful, you're clearly not cut out to be a mathematician.' Well, I *know* I'm not, but I'd have liked a little more explanation of what *makes* it beautiful, other than 'it's true'.) In all honesty, I preferred Snow's introduction to the actual apology - which is probably not surprising given that my ideal career would be in writing biographies.That said, there was enough in the Apology I *did* understand to allow me at least a glimpse of what it must be like to be a pure mathematician, and it was very interesting. Hardy is really very opinionated on what makes a decent human being, which I found quite entertaining, even if apparently I don't come up to scratch. But I think the most powerful parts of the Apology were, for me, the bits where Hardy talks about how fleeting mathematical powers are - he considered himself a late bloomer, in that he did his best work in his forties, and it's really very sad to hear him state baldly that no mathematical discoveries of any importance have been made by men (all mathematicians are men, by the language of 1940) over fifty, knowing full well that he was in his sixties as he wrote."
80,0521427061,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21505977-edwin-battistella,3,"A friend loaned me a copy of G. H. Hardy’s “A Mathematcian;s Apology” which focuses on the creative aspect of mathematical proofs. After a 60-page biographical essay/forward by C. P. Snow, the bulk of the slim volume (page 61-151) is Hardy’s ruminations on the creative aesthetic of mathematics—an apology in the older sense of a defense of a choice (i.e., the apology of Socrates). It’s hard not to be charmed by a book that begins with the (ironic?) line that “Exposition, criticisms, appreciation is work for second-rate minds,” dissing not but readers but himself as well. Feeling past his prime and concerned about the military uses of applied math, Hardy sets out to defend pure math versus applied. It’s a false dichotomy, I think, (and makes me think of C. P. Snow’s later two cultures false dichotomy), but Hardy’s apology turns out to be a discourse on the idea of being committed to a discipline—math, linguistics, criticism, physics, anthropology, you name it (or as one of my old professors put it, the value of having a perspective and theory with which to analyze the world). There is some math (Pythagoras’s proof of the irrationality of the square root of 2, etc.), but not enough to give anyone a headache. For me though, the real value of Hardy’s essay is that the seriousness of intellectual work lies is the ideas that it connects, not in immediate applications, making it worth a read by any academic. "
81,0521427061,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29745337-angelynn,3,"At first, it took me quite a while for the book to grab my undivided attention---but once it started discussing the actual beauty of mathematics, I could not put the book down. I read the book in one day, which was doable due to the [very] short length of the book. G.H. Hardy is a very very good writer, and the book was formulated in a lucid manner. I believe Hardy did a great job in simply describing the beauty of mathematics as an overall subject, as well as the ""utility"" in both pure and applied mathematics. What really bothered me the most was knowing that the book is quite old and dated---which I was constantly reminded of as I was thumbing through. For example, Hardy deemed Fermat's Last theorem as unsolved--while any modern day math enthusiast would know that the problem was solved in in 1994 by A. Wiles. Appearances of such antiquated facts had be vexed. Another trepidation I had was the author displaying some sexism by depicting mathematics as only being done by men. Of course this mostly is due to the book being old, but nevertheless, it was displeasing to read as a female mathematician. I am not sure if I can honestly recommend this book to many people. I still believe that the ""updated"" version of the book, ""Letters to a Young Mathematiican"" by Ian Stewart is a much more of a delight due to its contemporary outlook."
82,0521427061,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15470847-sujeet-gholap,2,"I hardly found anything interesting in the book. Hardy, (as he appropriately warns), comes across as a condescending snob. He does touch upon interesting topics, but doesn't delve deeper into anything of import. Many times, after his statements, I felt ""okay, so what's your point, finally?""I found his language to be a bit cumbersome and unnecessarily complicated. One of the reasons that I found nothing of much interest in the book could very well be because many of the things he talks about, I had already thought about them or they were rather obvious to me.It was interesting to see how the breakneck pace with which science and technology has progressed has made many of his ""assumptions"" and ""evident facts"" completely wrong. Advances in cryptography provide sufficient examples to undo his arguments about ""real mathematics being hardly of any use"". But again, that'll just strengthen his case!Towards the end, he has a tiny autobiographical section. I found it quite interesting.I would recommend reading it only if you haven't given ontology much thought or if you really really want to read it only because G. H. Hardy wrote it!"
83,0521427061,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25237828-maliha,4,"It was slightly boring at times. May be because I did not need convincing that pure mathematics is a form of art, and significantly different from that of applied mathematics? The foreword by C.P. Snow helped put things into perspective, and it made me see Hardy as more of a human being than just an author of a somewhat boring book. In the concluding chapter, Hardy says ""If I had a statue on a column in London, would I prefer the column to be so high that the statue was invisible, or low enough for the features to be recognizable? I would choose the first alternative, Dr. Snow, presumably, the second."" Funny thing is, Dr. Snow's foreword did just that. It brought down Hardy at a level where I could see, finally, who he really was, and what mathematics meant to him. His life outside of that of a pure mathematician, depicted by Snow, is what made reading this book a pleasant experience. Also, the concluding chapter was very personal, and touching, more so because of what I read about him in the foreword. It's a good little book, and anyone, in my opinion, should be able to appreciate what Hardy was trying to prove, I would think."
84,0521427061,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27511511-gaberber,5,"This is the reason we love Europe, the British Empire, and the nineteenth century. As Hardy himself said more than once in this essay, an ""apology"" is bound to be to some extent personal. Thus the reader's own life path and choices are sure to play a role in whether he finds this piece intellectually appealing or not. To me, the catharsis effects lying in Hardy's essay and Snow's foreword are no less than those offered by a good novel. It is a wonder in itself that we have the luxury to peek so intimately into the inner musings of a great mathematician and be washed away from ""reality"" by his flow of language and ideas in this deafening century of fanfare. I was especially in wonder when I got to the last chapter how the heck lucky he was to have been granted such a life that so many like me yearned for, yet I could feel not the slightest sign of jealousy but only reverence and (somewhat melancholic) happiness — from the knowledge that indeed such a life existed in the history of humanity. My words do no justice to the beauty and profundity of this little book. Go read it here: https://archive.org/details/AMathemat... (C.P. Snow's foreword is a must.)"
85,0521427061,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30519456-emil-petersen,4,"G.H. Hardy reminds me of Bertrand Russel's writings. This is good. It seems pleasurable to be an Oxbridge don at that time (and probably now as well). As for the content of the book, Hardy argues that 'real', pure mathematics is useless. Trivial 'school' mathematics is very useful and lies at the foundation of engineering, finance and so on, but pure mathematics does not carry such merit. I'm pretty sure that this is not true today. Theoretical computer science and cryptography are two examples. However, Hardy's point seems to be that the fact that the real mathematics is 'useless' in a pragmatic sense is actually good. It is unmarred by the good and evil consequences of carrying impact. It can be favorably compared with some arts; Hardy uses poetry. It's entertainment and is in this sense not meant to be useful.I both loathe and envy people who can philosophize on the usefulness of their profession without blinking. It is elevated above job security, sustained income, providing for the family etc. It must be nice to have one's life that way. No worries... Anyway, the book is nice, short and entertaining. Read it!"
86,0521427061,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11507273-hasan,4,"Often at times I have ""deluded"" myeslf into thinking that I would enjoy doing Mathematics. The delusion lies not in the act in itself but is described by the fact that I admit I do not have the capacity to do Mathematics as Hardy describes it: a creative act. Some reviewers have claimed that Hardy's tone is one of lamentation (of a Mathematician not able to do Mathematics). One can certainly find evidence of this in his writing though it is not as pronounced as has been made out to be. Snow's foreward does more to instill this notion than the book.I am willing to disregard any hints of elitism on Hardy's part to the end that despite my apparent inability to do serious mathematics, the book invites me to delve into this ocean of tranquility and oblivion( for the most part ). Du Sautoy's "" The Music of the Primes"" led me to read this short piece and I think that I didn't waste my time reading it. "

Hardy includes several well-known theorems, as proofs of the legitimacy of his claims, as well as a short section analysing the difference between real and applied mathematics, a section which seemed superfluous to my reading. However, I did find in this part I quote that struck me as particularly apt:‘Imaginary’ universes are so much more beautiful than this stupidly constructed ‘real’ one; and most of the finest products of an applied mathematician’s fancy must be rejected, as soon as they have been created, for the brutal but sufficient reason that they do not fit the facts."

But I'd rather underrate than overrate.Hardy is thoughtful but, alas, imprecise on a terribly difficult subject. In a sense history has not been kind to A Mathematician's Apology, as what he then called pure mathematics has since become much more ""useful"", notably Relativity, which he mentions specifically as having use for material pursuits. As a book of mathematical and philosophical value itself, it is not particularly important.Yet Hardy still shows a distinctive style and character, perhaps more than most other more ""literary"" writers can fabricate through their writing. Regardless of whatever one thinks of Hardy's mathematics, Hardy's Apology shows that he is a first-rate human being, and this may be one of the two main reasons to read it (the other being that it's very short!)."

This is book is about Hardy discussing about the usefulness of Mathematics to the world at large.The extensive forward by C P Snow( covering almost half the content) was a moving piece of the human side of the author. One of the best forwards I have come across.As far as the Apology goes, Hardy contemplates how the part of Mathematics found useful is just trivial and dull, the pure mathematics having practically no use to the layman, and therefore his contribution being nil. The last few pages of his quick autobiography is where he accepts that he is happy with the life lived for Mathematics. Easy read for even those without a mathematical background, it may inspire one to take up Mathematics if read at an early age."

I know little about mathematics and less about mathematicians and nothing at all about Mr. Hardy. And while it is not was not a bad piece of writing, I found the defense of mathematics a little tedious. I wished he had spent more than the last few pages talking about his career.

Hardy's best work, he adds in the apology, was done in collaboration with Littlewood, and in 1913, when he discouved Ramanujan.It is never worth a first class man's to express a majority opinion.

112,0521427061,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33810617-mike,3,A breif and slightly depressing look at the value of a life spent in mathematics. Well written and reasoned with an easy conversational style. Hardy couldn't forsee two major developments from modern mathematical physics; the transistor and nuclear war. This makes some of the discussion on the good and the harm of persuing mathematics a bit hard for the modern reader to swallow. But the author certainly can't be faulted for not being omniscient. Well worth reading.

122,0521427061,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5636950-bob-lewis,5,"""It is a melancholy experience for a professional mathematician to find himself writing about mathematics."" Thus begins Hardy's classic essay, laying bare the melancholy subtext of what is superficially a very positive book and simultaneously casting a verbal stone at those who busy themselves with critical exposition rather than creation. With that in mind, it seems a rather perverse exercise to write a review of such a book; nevertheless, Hardy's Apology merits some reflection.Essentially, this book explains its author's philosophy of mathematics in very brief terms. Proving only two simple and classic theorems from Ancient Greek mathematics in the entire text, it is written as an explanation of the mathematician's mind and directed to the non-mathematician. It paints a portrait of a man obsessed with his field and who wants to explain to the rest of the world why. Graham Greene called it ""the best account of what it is like to be a creative artist.""Indeed, I can think of no other book that more succinctly makes the case for viewing (I would also say, though Hardy does not, for teaching) mathematics as creative art. I can also think of no time when such an argument has been more needed. Though Hardy's essay was first published in 1940 (and C. P. Snow's lengthy foreword added in 1967), it is in the early twentieth century that I think the need for a widespread appreciation of mathematics has reached its peak at the same time that popular fear of mathematics has also reached an unprecedented level. Under such circumstances, it would behoove every mathematician to consider Hardy's philosophy as much as it would benefit every non-mathematician to understand the mathematician's perspective.To be sure, there are elements of Hardy's essay with which we may disagree. He has a general distrust of mathematics as applied to engineering (as might be expected from an essay written during World War II by a man who also saw World War I) which I cannot in good conscience endorse (though his point is well-argued) and a view that widespread knowledge of scientific subjects (chemistry, for instance) is largely useless outside of the communities of professionals trained and working in related fields which I find indefensible in an increasingly democratized information economy.Still other arguments are rather outdated. There is a deep and dark irony in the idea that a mathematician passionately concerned with the applications of mathematics to war would write something like the following: ""There is one comforting conclusion which is easy for a real mathematician. Real mathematics has no effects on war. No one has yet discovered any warlike purpose to be served by the theory of numbers or relativity, and it seems very unlikely that anyone will do so for many years."" Of course, relatively birthed the atomic bomb just five years later and number theory came to be the foundation of modern cryptography within the following decades. Despite the essay's positive tone, there is a depressing thread throughout, but Hardy could never have known how false that paragraph would ring just a few short years later.Still, despite some historical incongruities and points of minor (if impassioned) disagreement, this work remains arguably the best explanation of mathematics as an aesthetic pursuit in addition to (and perhaps even above) an applied one. For that reason alone, it merits serious consideration.The inclusion of C. P. Snow's lengthy (50-page) foreword adds a great deal of benefit for the reader. While it seems odd that so short a book should merit so long an introduction, the fact of the matter is that Snow provides the essential biographical context that helps the reader understand the circumstances under which Hardy wrote. Such context transforms Hardy's essay from a mere defense of mathematics (though it is a triumph of that genre) into an examination of the human condition worthy of a novelist. In view of Hardy's life history, one cannot help but to be moved by the concluding words of section 28: ""It is a pity that it should be necessary to make one very serious reservation--he must not be too old. Mathematics is not a contemplative but a creative subject; no one can draw much consolation from it when he has lost the power or the desire to create; and that is apt to happen to a mathematician rather soon. It is a pity, but in that case he does not matter a great deal anyhow, and it would be silly to bother about him.""Incidentally, despite his monumental mathematical achievements in his own right, one of Hardy's accomplishments was his ""discovery"" of the Indian mathematician Ramanujan. Mention of their collaboration is all but absent from Hardy's words but is given deft treatment in Snow's introduction. Those who enjoyed the recent film, ""The Man Who Knew Infinity,"" or who are otherwise familiar with Ramanujan's work will find some of these anecdotes quite interesting.In sum, this is a book that can be easily read in a single sitting but which has resonated with mathematical and mathematically-curious audiences across nearly eight decades. It has done so for a very good reason and should be considered required reading even today."

128,0521427061,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18836184-anthony-o-connor,5,"Deep powerful essay, all too shortHardy gives his views on what is mathematics and why it is worth doing, and at the end a bit on his personal choices and motivations. When he was young, yeah sure, ambition, fame and glory. But then he came to a better understanding. He is so clear and insightful. Clearly a genius. Well worth reading.To him mathematics is a creative art and a contribution to human knowledge. He is unabashedly realist and objectivist in his approach and philosophers of mathematics can just take a hike. He draws what is to him a very clear distinction between real, serious mathematics and trivial practical mathematics. Known recipes. He talks of mining one’s way down through increasingly subtle layers to find the underlying deep patterns, and provides a few perfect examples. This is all creative and decidedly non-trivial. Something he is happy to have contributed to. One of the few things which makes life non futile. Hmm?But He is also an elitist and a snob through and through, a privileged academic who was never concerned with money or the mundane details of who was actually feeding him. After all someone has to do all the trivial work of organising and running the world and producing all the ‘stuff’. He himself is of course above all that. He rather condescendingly tells us he is proud and relieved that higher, real, pure, mathematics is above the fray and is basically of no use to anyone. ( It cannot thereby be used in war. Admittedly this was written in 1940. It is still naive.)But he is sure or at least hopeful that neither his subject - analytic number theory/primes - nor the new relativity and quantum mechanics will ever be of any practical use to anyone. And that he asserts is a good thing. The irony is dripping. Security and encryption, atomic weapons and the whole dazzling array of modern electronics and computing, respectively. But so it goes.Read the introduction/biography by CP Snow if you must, but read it last. It is placed first and is longer than the essay.It is pompous, condescending and completely misses the point, so eager is the author to impose his own fatuous interpretation,And clearly lacking in any understanding of what mathematics is really all about."
129,0521427061,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1785447-david-glenn-dixon,4,"A curiously poignant little book, undertaken only when Hardy's creative faculties had left him. This fact is telling. While he was a mathematician, the work was self-justifying. Only once he was finished with it, deprived of its pleasures, did he need to make the case that his life had been worthwhile. So an ex-mathematician's apology really.C.P. Snow's lengthy foreword, more than half the length of the main text, is a vital record of how Hardy appeared to those around him. To American ears, the Oxbridge milieu sounds stifling, claustrophobic, so concerned with rank and class that you suspect intellectual life there, for all its loftiness, was needlessly, perhaps even recklessly narrow. And this is a book of narrowing, a book about the need not to pay much attention to things outside one's purview.It's also generally condescending to those outside the world of ""real mathematics,"" not to mention those whom Hardy considered untalented in every way yet who appeared to be more or less satisfied with their lives. So Hardy comes across, in his own compressed, straitened way, as fairly desperate. However humble he attempts to make himself appear, in certain passages, he is, when not writing to convince himself, writing to convince those who cannot attain his heights that they were—Now do you see?—indeed pretty high. No one does this sort of thing without feeling embattled and without having internalized the battle until it wouldn't let him be. Which is kind of pitiful.But the strength of a memoir, should you consider this one, is how well it conveys the essence of a unique human life. And this Hardy does well.Most curiously, in his last pages Hardy writes, ""journalism is the only profession, outside academic life, in which I should have felt really confident of my chances,"" seemingly unaware that journalists must take a sincere interest in the particulars of other people's lives, something for which he has shown little aptitude at all."
130,0521427061,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28605250-douglas,5,"""A Mathematician's Apology"" is another entry in a theme of mine of reading what could at best be termed ""non-current books"". As those who know me best already know, I am on a Mathematics kick right now. I ran across a reference to ""A Mathematician's Apology"" in an obscure mathematical corner of the internet.First, apology in this context doesn't mean Hardy is sorry about Math, but rather an explanation of it. I first ran into this sense of the word in Catholic apologies and they wer certainly not sorry.I had heard the name G. H. Hardy previously, but my mental folder on him was otherwise empty. Normally I don't read forewords to books, but I made an exception this time and I was glad I did. It was written by C. P. Snow another of the names who had an empty folder in my head. It turns out both Hardy & Snow were both professors at Cambridge in England. Snow's foreword documented his friendship with Hardy and gave a brief sketch of Hardy's life.""A Mathematician's Apology"" is that rarest of mathematical books in that is has very little actual math in it. It does speak of various theories and compares and contrasts them for seriousness, which is odd to an outsider. Snow mentioned in his foreword that Hardy was depressed in his later years. Mathematics is a young man's game and Hardy was luckier than most in that he was productive into his forties.However this book makes clear toward the end that he regrets the decline of his powers. I was saddened that he was so black and white in his thinking that he couldn't see how he could contribute in other ways. Mentoring the younger generation comes to mind.All in all this was a fascinating glimpse into the mind of a genius who was used to operating on a plane far above us mere mortals."
131,0521427061,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4676613-a-w,4,"I am no mathematician. Honestly, I quickly skimmed portions of this book because they dealt with theories far, far above my head. But Hardy's introspections about himself as a man are absolutely stunning in their transparency. Aware that he had long since passed his prime, he reflects deeply on his own self-worth. As much as his ambitious and brilliant mind allows, he seems to have arrived at peace with who he was and what he accomplished. This quotation early in the book stands out: ""What we do may be small, but is has a certain character of permanence; and to have produced anything of the slightest permanent interest, whether it be a copy of verses or a geometrical theorem, is to have done something utterly beyond the powers of the vast majority of men.""But the way Hardy concludes affected me most profoundly: ""I have just one chance of escaping a verdict of complete triviality, that I may be judged to have created something worth creating. and that I have created something is undeniable: the question is about its value. 	The case for my life, then, or for that matter anyone else who has been a mathematician in the same sense in which I have been one, is this: that I have added something to knowledge, and helped others to add more; and that theses somethings have a value which differs in degree only, and not in kind, from that of the creations of the great mathematicians, or of any of the other artists, great or small, who have left some kind of memorial behind them.""This book brought a great deal of clarity to my own self-examination and causes me to recommit myself to using the talents peculiar to myself to the greatest extent, and calling that a life well-lived."
132,0521427061,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16229679-misho-okropiridze,5,"Toward the end of his distinguished career, the renowned British mathematician G.H. Hardy eloquently laid out a justification for a life of studying mathematics in A Mathematician’s Apology, an essay first published in 1940. At the center of Hardy’s defense is the thesis that mathematics is an aesthetic discipline. For Hardy, the applied mathematics of engineers and economists held little charm. “Real mathematics,” as he referred to it, “must be justified as art if it can be justified at all.”To help make his point, Hardy includes two theorems from classical Greek mathematics, which, in his opinion, possess an elusive kind of beauty that, although difficult to define, is easy to recognize. The first of these results is Euclid’s proof that there are an infinite number of prime numbers. The secondresult is the discovery, attributed to the school of Pythagoras from around 500 B.C., that square root of 2 is irrational. It is this second theorem that demands our attention. (A course in number theory would focus on the first.) The argument uses only arithmetic, but its depth and importance cannot be overstated. As Hardy says, “[It] is a ‘simple’ theorem, simple both in idea and execution, but there is no doubt at all about [it being] of the highest class. [It] is as fresh and significant as when it was discovered—two thousand years have not written a wrinkle on [it]."
133,0521427061,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4441234-neel,3,"Hardy exhibits the tendency of mathematicians to generalise, and hold whatever knowledge the possess as immutable truth. I read his words heavily salted, and in that flavour they are entertaining, sometimes even insightful, especially in the second half of the book. He is often harshly condescending in his view of other pursuits, and who he considers lesser minds, which is presumably attributable to his outstanding success in what is among the most prestigious and difficult fields, but to me it reflects a narrow mind (which may be a consequence, if not a prerequisite for his success as a mathematician). I disagree with many of his dogmatic, if not ignorant claims (for instance, that 'real' mathematics begins with the Greeks, Oriental mathematics being merely an interesting curiosity). In this he may simply be a product of his time, yet it seems his position and association with geniuses of many sorts would have given him ample opportunity to reconsider his many biases. His subject matter is of course among the most fascinating possible (at least to someone interested in art, mathematics, and philosophy) but also by its very nature difficult to talk about. As a result, if often feels like he is saying very little, but given that so little has been said about the art of mathematics, the perspective of a legendary mathematician, an undeniable expert in his art, was still interesting to read."
134,0521427061,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9309867-nedislav,5,"This book is exactly what it claims to be: An insight into the mind of a mathematician. I watched The man who knew Infinity (2015) and this essay popped up a few days later. It really gives you an impression how mathematics is an art or the purest of science. There is something so magical and mystical, something absolute and at the same time infinitely dynamic. Hardy describes various reasons to love mathematics, mainly pure mathematics, and it is just endearing to read how a man who loves what he does defends its purpose. There is not so much to say because the book is written in a lovely manner.At one point Hardy recalls a quote the Littlewood muttered, and I would not like to forget it, is:The Greeks first spoke a language which modern mathematicians can understand: as Littlewood said to me once, they are not clever schoolboys or ‘scholarship candidates’, but ‘Fellows of another college’. So Greek mathematics is ‘permanent’, more permanent even than Greek literature. Archimedes will be remembered when Aeschylus is forgotten, because languages die and mathematical ideas do not. ‘Immortality’ may be a silly word, but probably a mathematician has the best chance of whatever it may mean."

This greatly saddened me since, on the contrary, mathematics is the exact opposite. In my humble opinion, mathematics is the expression of innate ideas in the most beautiful fashion, just like poetry, painting or music. A beautiful mathematical theory, conjecture or proof is bound to overwhelm the senses just as a bewitching poem or a melodious composition.This essay characterizes the above sentiment and more. I think it must be read by non-math people, more so than their mathematical counterparts, since there is a lot more they can learn from it. The book itself has very little (ignorable imo) mathematics and is indeed written for the layperson. In this sense ignorance is wonderful, for an ignorant person can learn far more than a learned. The question ""Would you rather choose all the knowledge in the world, or an eternal pursuit of it?"" comes to mind.Highly recommend reading, it is barely a hundred pages and can be read in an hour or two.Would have been a 5/5, but the mildly misogynistic undertones leave a bad taste in my mouth. But then again, the author lived in a different era and perhaps my standards do not apply."
136,0521427061,http://goodreads.com/user/show/162013-lauren,5,"I picked this book up as a gift for a mathematician but ended up reading it myself. As other reviewers have noted, it's not only an excellent look for the layman into the mind of a mathematician, but it also provides insight into the creative process that would be of interest to anyone. As the book nears its 80th anniversary, there's some ironies that I imagine Hardy, himself, would find amusing. One of the purposes of the book is to reflect on his work from the perspective of someone who feels they are part the most useful and meaningful days. The irony, of course, is that by writing this influential book, Hardy has shown us that he still has other powers beyond mathematics, and while he may feel he's past his usefulness, A Mathematician's Apology, will shows that even in his later years he will still accomplish great things. One of the more sadder ironies of course if that in this book he prides himself that pure math (i.e. theoretical math) lacks practical applications in times of war, and so it's free from the burden of creating harm, unlike applied science. Years after his death Hardy's number theory played a role in WW II cryptography and later in creating the internet."
137,0521427061,http://goodreads.com/user/show/97125751-antonis-maronikolakis,5,"A Mathematician’s Apology by G.H. Hardy is a piece containing the author’s thoughts on Math. It can be considered as a defense for his life, work and his chosen field in Math. This is not a science textbook, it reads more like an autobiographical and philosophical piece.The foreword by Snow gives some stories about Hardy and we get to see a pretty in-depth view of his character written by one of his best friends. The second part is written by Hardy and is cut into short, easily digestible chapters. In that part we get to see Hardy’s views on Math and a mathematician’s life and purpose.From start to finish, it was a very interesting and relaxing read. It is a great peek into the life of University mathematicians of the first half of the 20th century (although it does make me a bit jealous). The language and tone is smooth and makes for a very cozy read. The book itself is short, even with the foreword by Snow, and that adds to the casual feel of the reading.All in all, the book is a very enthralling read you can casually pick up on a lazy afternoon. I thoroughly enjoyed it and I highly recommend it."

Nor do I think it does Hardy's argument (for the mathematician) any good. One of my shorter serious reads, but ended up dropping about 80% through. Some things I do not like about this book is how opinionated the author is. G.H. Hardy has good enough reasoning skills that the unprepared reader might buy into his arguments. His premises are unsubstantiated. For example, his major premise talks how futile math is for people who do not find [math] aesthetically pleasing then proceeds to build upon it. Another infamous theme of Hardy is how mathematics is not a young man's game. Then he proceeds to build upon that premise too.I went into this book interested because the title ""Apology"" is Greek. It basically means ""In defense of"" the mathematician. Usually the Greeks used apology as in Socrates Apology as a bitter realization of something. Hardy doesn't adequately define the defense. Nor is there is a strong enough case to 'defend' mathematics. 3/5"
139,0521427061,http://goodreads.com/user/show/89329444-stuart-ross,2,"Although this is a famous book by an important author, I am joining those who give it a weak review. For the generally educated person who wants to understand something more about math and mathematicians, the book might indeed be an interesting exercise. For a career mathematician of any kind, he/she might want to engage in the arguments intensely and will learn more about Hardy as a person. But for someone like me with a long-term but inermittent interest in math, the book is repetitious of arguments I have had and read dozens of times for decades, from high school to college to adulthood, so little feels new and little is conclusive. (Perhaps Hardy was one of the best at addressing the issues clearly, making me like those who criticize Shakespeare for engaging in cliches.) For any educated grown-up in 21st century America, the male perspective and snobbery that once seemed normal in brilliant academics are now off-putting"
140,0521427061,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69594272-jose-samper,4,"Let me start by saying I did not read this edition, but one that I found online. I also did not read Snow's comment. The apology is interesting. Hardy was clearly a brilliant mathematician, and this writing is quite good. Spending time reading this was worthwhile, but I have to say that it is outdated. In particular, the great effort he makes to explain the uselessness of his work has certainly gone down the drain with the invention of computers: many mathematical theories, including several beautiful and deep corners of Hardy's beloved number theory, are essential to the functioning of computers these days! On the other hand his views on age and mathematics also are a bit ridiculous and have been proved wrong too. Nonetheless, it is a bit unfair to read this book and criticize crudely as if it was written these days. Clearly, Hardy was a man of his time and the way how we view the world and certainly mathematics, has evolved substantially (in my opinion for good!). "
141,0521427061,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10633326-ida,5,"There is something very appealing about the aesthetic abstraction in mathematics. It is hard to put into words the feeling of being able to follow all the steps in a proof. The lack logical inconsistencies. The sense of universality. However, I must admit, I usually get a bit uncomfortable whenever people start actually talking about beauty in mathematics. Obviously not because I disagree with the idea, but because you fall into this vague philosophical pit that is very hard to climb out of. Once you try to explain it, it is like it suddenly loses its purity.I do not think I have ever encountered better laid out arguments on the topic than in this book. Of course, this is partly because I am a but a kid, and not a very well read one at that. Still, I really enjoyed Hardy's carefully constructed paragraphs. Some parts, I must admit, I was not able to follow. Even after re-reading them. Hopefully, I will pick this up again in a few years. "

Snow, which adds a great deal to the book and Hardy himself. It's an interesting read and the title is legit. But it comes off as a sad statement from a creative person who knows it is all behind him. Mathematics is actually a very creative process. And Hardy was an artist in that world.One last thing. Hardy died believing that his world had no real world application. This is not true. It was just so far ahead of technology it appeared so. The math he created and also collaborated on is extremely important today.Overall very good small book.

Nevertheless, I believe he did a correct thing to share his thoughts and philosophy with other people, in particular those who are not mathematicians but yet are appealed to it.I was mostly struck by three things. First, I am impressed by his thought that the job of a mathematician, like a painter or a composer, is to create patterns. I am also touched by his long-year collaboration and relationship with J. E.

Snow, I could imagine the pressure that Hardy as a boy and as an atheist had to take, and how he found joy and peace in watching and playing cricket. All in all, I recommend this short book to anyone who is interested in mathematics. "

At any rate (and this was my main point) thisrealistic view is much more plausible of mathematicalthan of physical reality, because mathematical objectsare so much more what they seem. A chair or a star isnot in the least like what it seems to be; the more wethink of it, the fuzzier its outlines become in the hazeof sensation which surrounds it; but ‘2’ or ‘317’ hasnothing to do with sensation, and its properties standout the more clearly the more closely we scrutinizeit.""

It is a pity that it should be necessary to make one very serious reservation—he must not be too old. Mathematics is not a contemplative but a creative subject; no one can draw much consolation from it when he has lost the power or the desire to create; and that is apt to happen to a mathematician rather soon.“"

I neither heard about him nor was I taught any significant contributions made by him. The essay by Hardy does raise some important questions although showing juxtaposed reasons like his loss of interest at one point and lack of significance in the problems he was dealing. The forward is a negative for the book which is almost half of it. While Hardy by his own admission said that Ramanujan was his greatest discovery in the field of Maths, I felt a little repelled while he was compared to people like Einstein and Bohr, giving reasons for us to read this book, which in itself is a big justification for lackluster achievements."

Disappointingly, though, I didn't get much out of it. The style wasn't particularly engaging, and the subject was somewhat dull, or at least dully approached (essentially, why mathematicians do mathematics, and to what extent it's a defensible trade). I agreed with part of the thesis, i.e. that 'real' math is generally something people do because they like it and are good at it, not so much because it's useful to society, but the essay also pushed various other ideas I don't really agree with... anyway, the problem wasn't the ideas themselves so much as how they were presented."

152,0521427061,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5636950-bob-lewis,5,"""It is a melancholy experience for a professional mathematician to find himself writing about mathematics."" Thus begins Hardy's classic essay, laying bare the melancholy subtext of what is superficially a very positive book and simultaneously casting a verbal stone at those who busy themselves with critical exposition rather than creation. With that in mind, it seems a rather perverse exercise to write a review of such a book; nevertheless, Hardy's Apology merits some reflection.Essentially, this book explains its author's philosophy of mathematics in very brief terms. Proving only two simple and classic theorems from Ancient Greek mathematics in the entire text, it is written as an explanation of the mathematician's mind and directed to the non-mathematician. It paints a portrait of a man obsessed with his field and who wants to explain to the rest of the world why. Graham Greene called it ""the best account of what it is like to be a creative artist.""Indeed, I can think of no other book that more succinctly makes the case for viewing (I would also say, though Hardy does not, for teaching) mathematics as creative art. I can also think of no time when such an argument has been more needed. Though Hardy's essay was first published in 1940 (and C. P. Snow's lengthy foreword added in 1967), it is in the early twentieth century that I think the need for a widespread appreciation of mathematics has reached its peak at the same time that popular fear of mathematics has also reached an unprecedented level. Under such circumstances, it would behoove every mathematician to consider Hardy's philosophy as much as it would benefit every non-mathematician to understand the mathematician's perspective.To be sure, there are elements of Hardy's essay with which we may disagree. He has a general distrust of mathematics as applied to engineering (as might be expected from an essay written during World War II by a man who also saw World War I) which I cannot in good conscience endorse (though his point is well-argued) and a view that widespread knowledge of scientific subjects (chemistry, for instance) is largely useless outside of the communities of professionals trained and working in related fields which I find indefensible in an increasingly democratized information economy.Still other arguments are rather outdated. There is a deep and dark irony in the idea that a mathematician passionately concerned with the applications of mathematics to war would write something like the following: ""There is one comforting conclusion which is easy for a real mathematician. Real mathematics has no effects on war. No one has yet discovered any warlike purpose to be served by the theory of numbers or relativity, and it seems very unlikely that anyone will do so for many years."" Of course, relatively birthed the atomic bomb just five years later and number theory came to be the foundation of modern cryptography within the following decades. Despite the essay's positive tone, there is a depressing thread throughout, but Hardy could never have known how false that paragraph would ring just a few short years later.Still, despite some historical incongruities and points of minor (if impassioned) disagreement, this work remains arguably the best explanation of mathematics as an aesthetic pursuit in addition to (and perhaps even above) an applied one. For that reason alone, it merits serious consideration.The inclusion of C. P. Snow's lengthy (50-page) foreword adds a great deal of benefit for the reader. While it seems odd that so short a book should merit so long an introduction, the fact of the matter is that Snow provides the essential biographical context that helps the reader understand the circumstances under which Hardy wrote. Such context transforms Hardy's essay from a mere defense of mathematics (though it is a triumph of that genre) into an examination of the human condition worthy of a novelist. In view of Hardy's life history, one cannot help but to be moved by the concluding words of section 28: ""It is a pity that it should be necessary to make one very serious reservation--he must not be too old. Mathematics is not a contemplative but a creative subject; no one can draw much consolation from it when he has lost the power or the desire to create; and that is apt to happen to a mathematician rather soon. It is a pity, but in that case he does not matter a great deal anyhow, and it would be silly to bother about him.""Incidentally, despite his monumental mathematical achievements in his own right, one of Hardy's accomplishments was his ""discovery"" of the Indian mathematician Ramanujan. Mention of their collaboration is all but absent from Hardy's words but is given deft treatment in Snow's introduction. Those who enjoyed the recent film, ""The Man Who Knew Infinity,"" or who are otherwise familiar with Ramanujan's work will find some of these anecdotes quite interesting.In sum, this is a book that can be easily read in a single sitting but which has resonated with mathematical and mathematically-curious audiences across nearly eight decades. It has done so for a very good reason and should be considered required reading even today."

When he was young, yeah sure, ambition, fame and glory. But then he came to a better understanding. He is so clear and insightful. Clearly a genius. Well worth reading.To him mathematics is a creative art and a contribution to human knowledge. He is unabashedly realist and objectivist in his approach and philosophers of mathematics can just take a hike. He draws what is to him a very clear distinction between real, serious mathematics and trivial practical mathematics. Known recipes. He talks of mining one’s way down through increasingly subtle layers to find the underlying deep patterns, and provides a few perfect examples. This is all creative and decidedly non-trivial. Something he is happy to have contributed to. One of the few things which makes life non futile. Hmm?But He is also an elitist and a snob through and through, a privileged academic who was never concerned with money or the mundane details of who was actually feeding him. After all someone has to do all the trivial work of organising and running the world and producing all the ‘stuff’. He himself is of course above all that. He rather condescendingly tells us he is proud and relieved that higher, real, pure, mathematics is above the fray and is basically of no use to anyone. ( It cannot thereby be used in war. Admittedly this was written in 1940. It is still naive.)But he is sure or at least hopeful that neither his subject - analytic number theory/primes - nor the new relativity and quantum mechanics will ever be of any practical use to anyone. And that he asserts is a good thing. The irony is dripping. Security and encryption, atomic weapons and the whole dazzling array of modern electronics and computing, respectively. But so it goes.Read the introduction/biography by CP Snow if you must, but read it last. It is placed first and is longer than the essay.It is pompous, condescending and completely misses the point, so eager is the author to impose his own fatuous interpretation,And clearly lacking in any understanding of what mathematics is really all about."
159,0521427061,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1785447-david-glenn-dixon,4,"A curiously poignant little book, undertaken only when Hardy's creative faculties had left him. This fact is telling. While he was a mathematician, the work was self-justifying. Only once he was finished with it, deprived of its pleasures, did he need to make the case that his life had been worthwhile. So an ex-mathematician's apology really.C.P. Snow's lengthy foreword, more than half the length of the main text, is a vital record of how Hardy appeared to those around him. To American ears, the Oxbridge milieu sounds stifling, claustrophobic, so concerned with rank and class that you suspect intellectual life there, for all its loftiness, was needlessly, perhaps even recklessly narrow. And this is a book of narrowing, a book about the need not to pay much attention to things outside one's purview.It's also generally condescending to those outside the world of ""real mathematics,"" not to mention those whom Hardy considered untalented in every way yet who appeared to be more or less satisfied with their lives. So Hardy comes across, in his own compressed, straitened way, as fairly desperate. However humble he attempts to make himself appear, in certain passages, he is, when not writing to convince himself, writing to convince those who cannot attain his heights that they were—Now do you see?—indeed pretty high. No one does this sort of thing without feeling embattled and without having internalized the battle until it wouldn't let him be. Which is kind of pitiful.But the strength of a memoir, should you consider this one, is how well it conveys the essence of a unique human life. And this Hardy does well.Most curiously, in his last pages Hardy writes, ""journalism is the only profession, outside academic life, in which I should have felt really confident of my chances,"" seemingly unaware that journalists must take a sincere interest in the particulars of other people's lives, something for which he has shown little aptitude at all."
160,0521427061,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28605250-douglas,5,"""A Mathematician's Apology"" is another entry in a theme of mine of reading what could at best be termed ""non-current books"". As those who know me best already know, I am on a Mathematics kick right now. I ran across a reference to ""A Mathematician's Apology"" in an obscure mathematical corner of the internet.First, apology in this context doesn't mean Hardy is sorry about Math, but rather an explanation of it. I first ran into this sense of the word in Catholic apologies and they wer certainly not sorry.I had heard the name G. H. Hardy previously, but my mental folder on him was otherwise empty. Normally I don't read forewords to books, but I made an exception this time and I was glad I did. It was written by C. P. Snow another of the names who had an empty folder in my head. It turns out both Hardy & Snow were both professors at Cambridge in England. Snow's foreword documented his friendship with Hardy and gave a brief sketch of Hardy's life.""A Mathematician's Apology"" is that rarest of mathematical books in that is has very little actual math in it. It does speak of various theories and compares and contrasts them for seriousness, which is odd to an outsider. Snow mentioned in his foreword that Hardy was depressed in his later years. Mathematics is a young man's game and Hardy was luckier than most in that he was productive into his forties.However this book makes clear toward the end that he regrets the decline of his powers. I was saddened that he was so black and white in his thinking that he couldn't see how he could contribute in other ways. Mentoring the younger generation comes to mind.All in all this was a fascinating glimpse into the mind of a genius who was used to operating on a plane far above us mere mortals."
161,0521427061,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4676613-a-w,4,"I am no mathematician. Honestly, I quickly skimmed portions of this book because they dealt with theories far, far above my head. But Hardy's introspections about himself as a man are absolutely stunning in their transparency. Aware that he had long since passed his prime, he reflects deeply on his own self-worth. As much as his ambitious and brilliant mind allows, he seems to have arrived at peace with who he was and what he accomplished. This quotation early in the book stands out: ""What we do may be small, but is has a certain character of permanence; and to have produced anything of the slightest permanent interest, whether it be a copy of verses or a geometrical theorem, is to have done something utterly beyond the powers of the vast majority of men.""But the way Hardy concludes affected me most profoundly: ""I have just one chance of escaping a verdict of complete triviality, that I may be judged to have created something worth creating. and that I have created something is undeniable: the question is about its value. 	The case for my life, then, or for that matter anyone else who has been a mathematician in the same sense in which I have been one, is this: that I have added something to knowledge, and helped others to add more; and that theses somethings have a value which differs in degree only, and not in kind, from that of the creations of the great mathematicians, or of any of the other artists, great or small, who have left some kind of memorial behind them.""This book brought a great deal of clarity to my own self-examination and causes me to recommit myself to using the talents peculiar to myself to the greatest extent, and calling that a life well-lived."
162,0521427061,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16229679-misho-okropiridze,5,"Toward the end of his distinguished career, the renowned British mathematician G.H. Hardy eloquently laid out a justification for a life of studying mathematics in A Mathematician’s Apology, an essay first published in 1940. At the center of Hardy’s defense is the thesis that mathematics is an aesthetic discipline. For Hardy, the applied mathematics of engineers and economists held little charm. “Real mathematics,” as he referred to it, “must be justified as art if it can be justified at all.”To help make his point, Hardy includes two theorems from classical Greek mathematics, which, in his opinion, possess an elusive kind of beauty that, although difficult to define, is easy to recognize. The first of these results is Euclid’s proof that there are an infinite number of prime numbers. The secondresult is the discovery, attributed to the school of Pythagoras from around 500 B.C., that square root of 2 is irrational. It is this second theorem that demands our attention. (A course in number theory would focus on the first.) The argument uses only arithmetic, but its depth and importance cannot be overstated. As Hardy says, “[It] is a ‘simple’ theorem, simple both in idea and execution, but there is no doubt at all about [it being] of the highest class. [It] is as fresh and significant as when it was discovered—two thousand years have not written a wrinkle on [it]."
163,0521427061,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4441234-neel,3,"Hardy exhibits the tendency of mathematicians to generalise, and hold whatever knowledge the possess as immutable truth. I read his words heavily salted, and in that flavour they are entertaining, sometimes even insightful, especially in the second half of the book. He is often harshly condescending in his view of other pursuits, and who he considers lesser minds, which is presumably attributable to his outstanding success in what is among the most prestigious and difficult fields, but to me it reflects a narrow mind (which may be a consequence, if not a prerequisite for his success as a mathematician). I disagree with many of his dogmatic, if not ignorant claims (for instance, that 'real' mathematics begins with the Greeks, Oriental mathematics being merely an interesting curiosity). In this he may simply be a product of his time, yet it seems his position and association with geniuses of many sorts would have given him ample opportunity to reconsider his many biases. His subject matter is of course among the most fascinating possible (at least to someone interested in art, mathematics, and philosophy) but also by its very nature difficult to talk about. As a result, if often feels like he is saying very little, but given that so little has been said about the art of mathematics, the perspective of a legendary mathematician, an undeniable expert in his art, was still interesting to read."
164,0521427061,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9309867-nedislav,5,"This book is exactly what it claims to be: An insight into the mind of a mathematician. I watched The man who knew Infinity (2015) and this essay popped up a few days later. It really gives you an impression how mathematics is an art or the purest of science. There is something so magical and mystical, something absolute and at the same time infinitely dynamic. Hardy describes various reasons to love mathematics, mainly pure mathematics, and it is just endearing to read how a man who loves what he does defends its purpose. There is not so much to say because the book is written in a lovely manner.At one point Hardy recalls a quote the Littlewood muttered, and I would not like to forget it, is:The Greeks first spoke a language which modern mathematicians can understand: as Littlewood said to me once, they are not clever schoolboys or ‘scholarship candidates’, but ‘Fellows of another college’. So Greek mathematics is ‘permanent’, more permanent even than Greek literature. Archimedes will be remembered when Aeschylus is forgotten, because languages die and mathematical ideas do not. ‘Immortality’ may be a silly word, but probably a mathematician has the best chance of whatever it may mean."

This greatly saddened me since, on the contrary, mathematics is the exact opposite. In my humble opinion, mathematics is the expression of innate ideas in the most beautiful fashion, just like poetry, painting or music. A beautiful mathematical theory, conjecture or proof is bound to overwhelm the senses just as a bewitching poem or a melodious composition.This essay characterizes the above sentiment and more. I think it must be read by non-math people, more so than their mathematical counterparts, since there is a lot more they can learn from it. The book itself has very little (ignorable imo) mathematics and is indeed written for the layperson. In this sense ignorance is wonderful, for an ignorant person can learn far more than a learned. The question ""Would you rather choose all the knowledge in the world, or an eternal pursuit of it?"" comes to mind.Highly recommend reading, it is barely a hundred pages and can be read in an hour or two.Would have been a 5/5, but the mildly misogynistic undertones leave a bad taste in my mouth. But then again, the author lived in a different era and perhaps my standards do not apply."
166,0521427061,http://goodreads.com/user/show/162013-lauren,5,"I picked this book up as a gift for a mathematician but ended up reading it myself. As other reviewers have noted, it's not only an excellent look for the layman into the mind of a mathematician, but it also provides insight into the creative process that would be of interest to anyone. As the book nears its 80th anniversary, there's some ironies that I imagine Hardy, himself, would find amusing. One of the purposes of the book is to reflect on his work from the perspective of someone who feels they are part the most useful and meaningful days. The irony, of course, is that by writing this influential book, Hardy has shown us that he still has other powers beyond mathematics, and while he may feel he's past his usefulness, A Mathematician's Apology, will shows that even in his later years he will still accomplish great things. One of the more sadder ironies of course if that in this book he prides himself that pure math (i.e. theoretical math) lacks practical applications in times of war, and so it's free from the burden of creating harm, unlike applied science. Years after his death Hardy's number theory played a role in WW II cryptography and later in creating the internet."
167,0521427061,http://goodreads.com/user/show/97125751-antonis-maronikolakis,5,"A Mathematician’s Apology by G.H. Hardy is a piece containing the author’s thoughts on Math. It can be considered as a defense for his life, work and his chosen field in Math. This is not a science textbook, it reads more like an autobiographical and philosophical piece.The foreword by Snow gives some stories about Hardy and we get to see a pretty in-depth view of his character written by one of his best friends. The second part is written by Hardy and is cut into short, easily digestible chapters. In that part we get to see Hardy’s views on Math and a mathematician’s life and purpose.From start to finish, it was a very interesting and relaxing read. It is a great peek into the life of University mathematicians of the first half of the 20th century (although it does make me a bit jealous). The language and tone is smooth and makes for a very cozy read. The book itself is short, even with the foreword by Snow, and that adds to the casual feel of the reading.All in all, the book is a very enthralling read you can casually pick up on a lazy afternoon. I thoroughly enjoyed it and I highly recommend it."

Nor do I think it does Hardy's argument (for the mathematician) any good. One of my shorter serious reads, but ended up dropping about 80% through. Some things I do not like about this book is how opinionated the author is. G.H. Hardy has good enough reasoning skills that the unprepared reader might buy into his arguments. His premises are unsubstantiated. For example, his major premise talks how futile math is for people who do not find [math] aesthetically pleasing then proceeds to build upon it. Another infamous theme of Hardy is how mathematics is not a young man's game. Then he proceeds to build upon that premise too.I went into this book interested because the title ""Apology"" is Greek. It basically means ""In defense of"" the mathematician. Usually the Greeks used apology as in Socrates Apology as a bitter realization of something. Hardy doesn't adequately define the defense. Nor is there is a strong enough case to 'defend' mathematics. 3/5"

For the generally educated person who wants to understand something more about math and mathematicians, the book might indeed be an interesting exercise. For a career mathematician of any kind, he/she might want to engage in the arguments intensely and will learn more about Hardy as a person. But for someone like me with a long-term but inermittent interest in math, the book is repetitious of arguments I have had and read dozens of times for decades, from high school to college to adulthood, so little feels new and little is conclusive. (Perhaps Hardy was one of the best at addressing the issues clearly, making me like those who criticize Shakespeare for engaging in cliches.) For any educated grown-up in 21st century America, the male perspective and snobbery that once seemed normal in brilliant academics are now off-putting"

The apology is interesting. Hardy was clearly a brilliant mathematician, and this writing is quite good. Spending time reading this was worthwhile, but I have to say that it is outdated. In particular, the great effort he makes to explain the uselessness of his work has certainly gone down the drain with the invention of computers: many mathematical theories, including several beautiful and deep corners of Hardy's beloved number theory, are essential to the functioning of computers these days! On the other hand his views on age and mathematics also are a bit ridiculous and have been proved wrong too. Nonetheless, it is a bit unfair to read this book and criticize crudely as if it was written these days. Clearly, Hardy was a man of his time and the way how we view the world and certainly mathematics, has evolved substantially (in my opinion for good!). "
171,0521427061,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10633326-ida,5,"There is something very appealing about the aesthetic abstraction in mathematics. It is hard to put into words the feeling of being able to follow all the steps in a proof. The lack logical inconsistencies. The sense of universality. However, I must admit, I usually get a bit uncomfortable whenever people start actually talking about beauty in mathematics. Obviously not because I disagree with the idea, but because you fall into this vague philosophical pit that is very hard to climb out of. Once you try to explain it, it is like it suddenly loses its purity.I do not think I have ever encountered better laid out arguments on the topic than in this book. Of course, this is partly because I am a but a kid, and not a very well read one at that. Still, I really enjoyed Hardy's carefully constructed paragraphs. Some parts, I must admit, I was not able to follow. Even after re-reading them. Hopefully, I will pick this up again in a few years. "

Snow, which adds a great deal to the book and Hardy himself. It's an interesting read and the title is legit. But it comes off as a sad statement from a creative person who knows it is all behind him. Mathematics is actually a very creative process. And Hardy was an artist in that world.One last thing. Hardy died believing that his world had no real world application. This is not true. It was just so far ahead of technology it appeared so.

Hardy wrote well about his thoughts in and about mathematics, though he lamented that the fact of writing about mathematics - not doing it - is a symbol of weakness. Nevertheless, I believe he did a correct thing to share his thoughts and philosophy with other people, in particular those who are not mathematicians but yet are appealed to it.I was mostly struck by three things. First, I am impressed by his thought that the job of a mathematician, like a painter or a composer, is to create patterns. I am also touched by his long-year collaboration and relationship with J. E. Littlewood Srinivasa Ramanujan. Finally, thanks to the words of his friend C. P. Snow, I could imagine the pressure that Hardy as a boy and as an atheist had to take, and how he found joy and peace in watching and playing cricket. All in all, I recommend this short book to anyone who is interested in mathematics. "

At any rate (and this was my main point) thisrealistic view is much more plausible of mathematicalthan of physical reality, because mathematical objectsare so much more what they seem. A chair or a star isnot in the least like what it seems to be; the more wethink of it, the fuzzier its outlines become in the hazeof sensation which surrounds it; but ‘2’ or ‘317’ hasnothing to do with sensation, and its properties standout the more clearly the more closely we scrutinizeit.""

It is a pity that it should be necessary to make one very serious reservation—he must not be too old.

I neither heard about him nor was I taught any significant contributions made by him. The essay by Hardy does raise some important questions although showing juxtaposed reasons like his loss of interest at one point and lack of significance in the problems he was dealing. The forward is a negative for the book which is almost half of it. While Hardy by his own admission said that Ramanujan was his greatest discovery in the field of Maths, I felt a little repelled while he was compared to people like Einstein and Bohr, giving reasons for us to read this book, which in itself is a big justification for lackluster achievements."

Disappointingly, though, I didn't get much out of it. The style wasn't particularly engaging, and the subject was somewhat dull, or at least dully approached (essentially, why mathematicians do mathematics, and to what extent it's a defensible trade). I agreed with part of the thesis, i.e. that 'real' math is generally something people do because they like it and are good at it, not so much because it's useful to society, but the essay also pushed various other ideas I don't really agree with... anyway, the problem wasn't the ideas themselves so much as how they were presented."

182,0521427061,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5636950-bob-lewis,5,"""It is a melancholy experience for a professional mathematician to find himself writing about mathematics."" Thus begins Hardy's classic essay, laying bare the melancholy subtext of what is superficially a very positive book and simultaneously casting a verbal stone at those who busy themselves with critical exposition rather than creation. With that in mind, it seems a rather perverse exercise to write a review of such a book; nevertheless, Hardy's Apology merits some reflection.Essentially, this book explains its author's philosophy of mathematics in very brief terms. Proving only two simple and classic theorems from Ancient Greek mathematics in the entire text, it is written as an explanation of the mathematician's mind and directed to the non-mathematician. It paints a portrait of a man obsessed with his field and who wants to explain to the rest of the world why. Graham Greene called it ""the best account of what it is like to be a creative artist.""Indeed, I can think of no other book that more succinctly makes the case for viewing (I would also say, though Hardy does not, for teaching) mathematics as creative art. I can also think of no time when such an argument has been more needed. Though Hardy's essay was first published in 1940 (and C. P. Snow's lengthy foreword added in 1967), it is in the early twentieth century that I think the need for a widespread appreciation of mathematics has reached its peak at the same time that popular fear of mathematics has also reached an unprecedented level. Under such circumstances, it would behoove every mathematician to consider Hardy's philosophy as much as it would benefit every non-mathematician to understand the mathematician's perspective.To be sure, there are elements of Hardy's essay with which we may disagree. He has a general distrust of mathematics as applied to engineering (as might be expected from an essay written during World War II by a man who also saw World War I) which I cannot in good conscience endorse (though his point is well-argued) and a view that widespread knowledge of scientific subjects (chemistry, for instance) is largely useless outside of the communities of professionals trained and working in related fields which I find indefensible in an increasingly democratized information economy.Still other arguments are rather outdated. There is a deep and dark irony in the idea that a mathematician passionately concerned with the applications of mathematics to war would write something like the following: ""There is one comforting conclusion which is easy for a real mathematician. Real mathematics has no effects on war. No one has yet discovered any warlike purpose to be served by the theory of numbers or relativity, and it seems very unlikely that anyone will do so for many years."" Of course, relatively birthed the atomic bomb just five years later and number theory came to be the foundation of modern cryptography within the following decades. Despite the essay's positive tone, there is a depressing thread throughout, but Hardy could never have known how false that paragraph would ring just a few short years later.Still, despite some historical incongruities and points of minor (if impassioned) disagreement, this work remains arguably the best explanation of mathematics as an aesthetic pursuit in addition to (and perhaps even above) an applied one. For that reason alone, it merits serious consideration.The inclusion of C. P. Snow's lengthy (50-page) foreword adds a great deal of benefit for the reader. While it seems odd that so short a book should merit so long an introduction, the fact of the matter is that Snow provides the essential biographical context that helps the reader understand the circumstances under which Hardy wrote. Such context transforms Hardy's essay from a mere defense of mathematics (though it is a triumph of that genre) into an examination of the human condition worthy of a novelist. In view of Hardy's life history, one cannot help but to be moved by the concluding words of section 28: ""It is a pity that it should be necessary to make one very serious reservation--he must not be too old. Mathematics is not a contemplative but a creative subject; no one can draw much consolation from it when he has lost the power or the desire to create; and that is apt to happen to a mathematician rather soon. It is a pity, but in that case he does not matter a great deal anyhow, and it would be silly to bother about him.""Incidentally, despite his monumental mathematical achievements in his own right, one of Hardy's accomplishments was his ""discovery"" of the Indian mathematician Ramanujan. Mention of their collaboration is all but absent from Hardy's words but is given deft treatment in Snow's introduction. Those who enjoyed the recent film, ""The Man Who Knew Infinity,"" or who are otherwise familiar with Ramanujan's work will find some of these anecdotes quite interesting.In sum, this is a book that can be easily read in a single sitting but which has resonated with mathematical and mathematically-curious audiences across nearly eight decades. It has done so for a very good reason and should be considered required reading even today."

When he was young, yeah sure, ambition, fame and glory. But then he came to a better understanding. He is so clear and insightful. Clearly a genius. Well worth reading.To him mathematics is a creative art and a contribution to human knowledge. He is unabashedly realist and objectivist in his approach and philosophers of mathematics can just take a hike. He draws what is to him a very clear distinction between real, serious mathematics and trivial practical mathematics. Known recipes. He talks of mining one’s way down through increasingly subtle layers to find the underlying deep patterns, and provides a few perfect examples. This is all creative and decidedly non-trivial. Something he is happy to have contributed to. One of the few things which makes life non futile. Hmm?But He is also an elitist and a snob through and through, a privileged academic who was never concerned with money or the mundane details of who was actually feeding him. After all someone has to do all the trivial work of organising and running the world and producing all the ‘stuff’. He himself is of course above all that. He rather condescendingly tells us he is proud and relieved that higher, real, pure, mathematics is above the fray and is basically of no use to anyone. ( It cannot thereby be used in war. Admittedly this was written in 1940. It is still naive.)But he is sure or at least hopeful that neither his subject - analytic number theory/primes - nor the new relativity and quantum mechanics will ever be of any practical use to anyone. And that he asserts is a good thing. The irony is dripping. Security and encryption, atomic weapons and the whole dazzling array of modern electronics and computing, respectively. But so it goes.Read the introduction/biography by CP Snow if you must, but read it last. It is placed first and is longer than the essay.It is pompous, condescending and completely misses the point, so eager is the author to impose his own fatuous interpretation,And clearly lacking in any understanding of what mathematics is really all about."
189,0521427061,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1785447-david-glenn-dixon,4,"A curiously poignant little book, undertaken only when Hardy's creative faculties had left him. This fact is telling. While he was a mathematician, the work was self-justifying. Only once he was finished with it, deprived of its pleasures, did he need to make the case that his life had been worthwhile. So an ex-mathematician's apology really.C.P. Snow's lengthy foreword, more than half the length of the main text, is a vital record of how Hardy appeared to those around him. To American ears, the Oxbridge milieu sounds stifling, claustrophobic, so concerned with rank and class that you suspect intellectual life there, for all its loftiness, was needlessly, perhaps even recklessly narrow. And this is a book of narrowing, a book about the need not to pay much attention to things outside one's purview.It's also generally condescending to those outside the world of ""real mathematics,"" not to mention those whom Hardy considered untalented in every way yet who appeared to be more or less satisfied with their lives. So Hardy comes across, in his own compressed, straitened way, as fairly desperate. However humble he attempts to make himself appear, in certain passages, he is, when not writing to convince himself, writing to convince those who cannot attain his heights that they were—Now do you see?—indeed pretty high. No one does this sort of thing without feeling embattled and without having internalized the battle until it wouldn't let him be. Which is kind of pitiful.But the strength of a memoir, should you consider this one, is how well it conveys the essence of a unique human life. And this Hardy does well.Most curiously, in his last pages Hardy writes, ""journalism is the only profession, outside academic life, in which I should have felt really confident of my chances,"" seemingly unaware that journalists must take a sincere interest in the particulars of other people's lives, something for which he has shown little aptitude at all."
190,0521427061,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28605250-douglas,5,"""A Mathematician's Apology"" is another entry in a theme of mine of reading what could at best be termed ""non-current books"". As those who know me best already know, I am on a Mathematics kick right now. I ran across a reference to ""A Mathematician's Apology"" in an obscure mathematical corner of the internet.First, apology in this context doesn't mean Hardy is sorry about Math, but rather an explanation of it. I first ran into this sense of the word in Catholic apologies and they wer certainly not sorry.I had heard the name G. H. Hardy previously, but my mental folder on him was otherwise empty. Normally I don't read forewords to books, but I made an exception this time and I was glad I did. It was written by C. P. Snow another of the names who had an empty folder in my head. It turns out both Hardy & Snow were both professors at Cambridge in England. Snow's foreword documented his friendship with Hardy and gave a brief sketch of Hardy's life.""A Mathematician's Apology"" is that rarest of mathematical books in that is has very little actual math in it. It does speak of various theories and compares and contrasts them for seriousness, which is odd to an outsider. Snow mentioned in his foreword that Hardy was depressed in his later years. Mathematics is a young man's game and Hardy was luckier than most in that he was productive into his forties.However this book makes clear toward the end that he regrets the decline of his powers. I was saddened that he was so black and white in his thinking that he couldn't see how he could contribute in other ways. Mentoring the younger generation comes to mind.All in all this was a fascinating glimpse into the mind of a genius who was used to operating on a plane far above us mere mortals."
191,0521427061,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4676613-a-w,4,"I am no mathematician. Honestly, I quickly skimmed portions of this book because they dealt with theories far, far above my head. But Hardy's introspections about himself as a man are absolutely stunning in their transparency. Aware that he had long since passed his prime, he reflects deeply on his own self-worth. As much as his ambitious and brilliant mind allows, he seems to have arrived at peace with who he was and what he accomplished. This quotation early in the book stands out: ""What we do may be small, but is has a certain character of permanence; and to have produced anything of the slightest permanent interest, whether it be a copy of verses or a geometrical theorem, is to have done something utterly beyond the powers of the vast majority of men.""But the way Hardy concludes affected me most profoundly: ""I have just one chance of escaping a verdict of complete triviality, that I may be judged to have created something worth creating. and that I have created something is undeniable: the question is about its value. 	The case for my life, then, or for that matter anyone else who has been a mathematician in the same sense in which I have been one, is this: that I have added something to knowledge, and helped others to add more; and that theses somethings have a value which differs in degree only, and not in kind, from that of the creations of the great mathematicians, or of any of the other artists, great or small, who have left some kind of memorial behind them.""This book brought a great deal of clarity to my own self-examination and causes me to recommit myself to using the talents peculiar to myself to the greatest extent, and calling that a life well-lived."
192,0521427061,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16229679-misho-okropiridze,5,"Toward the end of his distinguished career, the renowned British mathematician G.H. Hardy eloquently laid out a justification for a life of studying mathematics in A Mathematician’s Apology, an essay first published in 1940. At the center of Hardy’s defense is the thesis that mathematics is an aesthetic discipline. For Hardy, the applied mathematics of engineers and economists held little charm. “Real mathematics,” as he referred to it, “must be justified as art if it can be justified at all.”To help make his point, Hardy includes two theorems from classical Greek mathematics, which, in his opinion, possess an elusive kind of beauty that, although difficult to define, is easy to recognize. The first of these results is Euclid’s proof that there are an infinite number of prime numbers. The secondresult is the discovery, attributed to the school of Pythagoras from around 500 B.C., that square root of 2 is irrational. It is this second theorem that demands our attention. (A course in number theory would focus on the first.) The argument uses only arithmetic, but its depth and importance cannot be overstated. As Hardy says, “[It] is a ‘simple’ theorem, simple both in idea and execution, but there is no doubt at all about [it being] of the highest class. [It] is as fresh and significant as when it was discovered—two thousand years have not written a wrinkle on [it]."
193,0521427061,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4441234-neel,3,"Hardy exhibits the tendency of mathematicians to generalise, and hold whatever knowledge the possess as immutable truth. I read his words heavily salted, and in that flavour they are entertaining, sometimes even insightful, especially in the second half of the book. He is often harshly condescending in his view of other pursuits, and who he considers lesser minds, which is presumably attributable to his outstanding success in what is among the most prestigious and difficult fields, but to me it reflects a narrow mind (which may be a consequence, if not a prerequisite for his success as a mathematician). I disagree with many of his dogmatic, if not ignorant claims (for instance, that 'real' mathematics begins with the Greeks, Oriental mathematics being merely an interesting curiosity). In this he may simply be a product of his time, yet it seems his position and association with geniuses of many sorts would have given him ample opportunity to reconsider his many biases. His subject matter is of course among the most fascinating possible (at least to someone interested in art, mathematics, and philosophy) but also by its very nature difficult to talk about. As a result, if often feels like he is saying very little, but given that so little has been said about the art of mathematics, the perspective of a legendary mathematician, an undeniable expert in his art, was still interesting to read."
194,0521427061,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9309867-nedislav,5,"This book is exactly what it claims to be: An insight into the mind of a mathematician. I watched The man who knew Infinity (2015) and this essay popped up a few days later. It really gives you an impression how mathematics is an art or the purest of science. There is something so magical and mystical, something absolute and at the same time infinitely dynamic. Hardy describes various reasons to love mathematics, mainly pure mathematics, and it is just endearing to read how a man who loves what he does defends its purpose. There is not so much to say because the book is written in a lovely manner.At one point Hardy recalls a quote the Littlewood muttered, and I would not like to forget it, is:The Greeks first spoke a language which modern mathematicians can understand: as Littlewood said to me once, they are not clever schoolboys or ‘scholarship candidates’, but ‘Fellows of another college’. So Greek mathematics is ‘permanent’, more permanent even than Greek literature. Archimedes will be remembered when Aeschylus is forgotten, because languages die and mathematical ideas do not. ‘Immortality’ may be a silly word, but probably a mathematician has the best chance of whatever it may mean."

This greatly saddened me since, on the contrary, mathematics is the exact opposite. In my humble opinion, mathematics is the expression of innate ideas in the most beautiful fashion, just like poetry, painting or music. A beautiful mathematical theory, conjecture or proof is bound to overwhelm the senses just as a bewitching poem or a melodious composition.This essay characterizes the above sentiment and more. I think it must be read by non-math people, more so than their mathematical counterparts, since there is a lot more they can learn from it. The book itself has very little (ignorable imo) mathematics and is indeed written for the layperson. In this sense ignorance is wonderful, for an ignorant person can learn far more than a learned. The question ""Would you rather choose all the knowledge in the world, or an eternal pursuit of it?"" comes to mind.Highly recommend reading, it is barely a hundred pages and can be read in an hour or two.Would have been a 5/5, but the mildly misogynistic undertones leave a bad taste in my mouth. But then again, the author lived in a different era and perhaps my standards do not apply."
196,0521427061,http://goodreads.com/user/show/162013-lauren,5,"I picked this book up as a gift for a mathematician but ended up reading it myself. As other reviewers have noted, it's not only an excellent look for the layman into the mind of a mathematician, but it also provides insight into the creative process that would be of interest to anyone. As the book nears its 80th anniversary, there's some ironies that I imagine Hardy, himself, would find amusing. One of the purposes of the book is to reflect on his work from the perspective of someone who feels they are part the most useful and meaningful days. The irony, of course, is that by writing this influential book, Hardy has shown us that he still has other powers beyond mathematics, and while he may feel he's past his usefulness, A Mathematician's Apology, will shows that even in his later years he will still accomplish great things. One of the more sadder ironies of course if that in this book he prides himself that pure math (i.e. theoretical math) lacks practical applications in times of war, and so it's free from the burden of creating harm, unlike applied science. Years after his death Hardy's number theory played a role in WW II cryptography and later in creating the internet."
197,0521427061,http://goodreads.com/user/show/97125751-antonis-maronikolakis,5,"A Mathematician’s Apology by G.H. Hardy is a piece containing the author’s thoughts on Math. It can be considered as a defense for his life, work and his chosen field in Math. This is not a science textbook, it reads more like an autobiographical and philosophical piece.The foreword by Snow gives some stories about Hardy and we get to see a pretty in-depth view of his character written by one of his best friends. The second part is written by Hardy and is cut into short, easily digestible chapters. In that part we get to see Hardy’s views on Math and a mathematician’s life and purpose.From start to finish, it was a very interesting and relaxing read. It is a great peek into the life of University mathematicians of the first half of the 20th century (although it does make me a bit jealous). The language and tone is smooth and makes for a very cozy read. The book itself is short, even with the foreword by Snow, and that adds to the casual feel of the reading.All in all, the book is a very enthralling read you can casually pick up on a lazy afternoon. I thoroughly enjoyed it and I highly recommend it."

Nor do I think it does Hardy's argument (for the mathematician) any good. One of my shorter serious reads, but ended up dropping about 80% through. Some things I do not like about this book is how opinionated the author is. G.H. Hardy has good enough reasoning skills that the unprepared reader might buy into his arguments. His premises are unsubstantiated. For example, his major premise talks how futile math is for people who do not find [math] aesthetically pleasing then proceeds to build upon it. Another infamous theme of Hardy is how mathematics is not a young man's game. Then he proceeds to build upon that premise too.I went into this book interested because the title ""Apology"" is Greek. It basically means ""In defense of"" the mathematician. Usually the Greeks used apology as in Socrates Apology as a bitter realization of something. Hardy doesn't adequately define the defense. Nor is there is a strong enough case to 'defend' mathematics. 3/5"

For the generally educated person who wants to understand something more about math and mathematicians, the book might indeed be an interesting exercise. For a career mathematician of any kind, he/she might want to engage in the arguments intensely and will learn more about Hardy as a person. But for someone like me with a long-term but inermittent interest in math, the book is repetitious of arguments I have had and read dozens of times for decades, from high school to college to adulthood, so little feels new and little is conclusive. (Perhaps Hardy was one of the best at addressing the issues clearly, making me like those who criticize Shakespeare for engaging in cliches.) For any educated grown-up in 21st century America, the male perspective and snobbery that once seemed normal in brilliant academics are now off-putting"

The apology is interesting. Hardy was clearly a brilliant mathematician, and this writing is quite good. Spending time reading this was worthwhile, but I have to say that it is outdated. In particular, the great effort he makes to explain the uselessness of his work has certainly gone down the drain with the invention of computers: many mathematical theories, including several beautiful and deep corners of Hardy's beloved number theory, are essential to the functioning of computers these days! On the other hand his views on age and mathematics also are a bit ridiculous and have been proved wrong too. Nonetheless, it is a bit unfair to read this book and criticize crudely as if it was written these days. Clearly, Hardy was a man of his time and the way how we view the world and certainly mathematics, has evolved substantially (in my opinion for good!). "
201,0521427061,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10633326-ida,5,"There is something very appealing about the aesthetic abstraction in mathematics. It is hard to put into words the feeling of being able to follow all the steps in a proof. The lack logical inconsistencies. The sense of universality. However, I must admit, I usually get a bit uncomfortable whenever people start actually talking about beauty in mathematics. Obviously not because I disagree with the idea, but because you fall into this vague philosophical pit that is very hard to climb out of. Once you try to explain it, it is like it suddenly loses its purity.I do not think I have ever encountered better laid out arguments on the topic than in this book. Of course, this is partly because I am a but a kid, and not a very well read one at that. Still, I really enjoyed Hardy's carefully constructed paragraphs.

I've read several biographies on mathematicians and physicists, so Hardy's name has come up often. He was an extraordinary man. The book is almost half the foreword by J.P. Snow, which adds a great deal to the book and Hardy himself. It's an interesting read and the title is legit. But it comes off as a sad statement from a creative person who knows it is all behind him. Mathematics is actually a very creative process. And Hardy was an artist in that world.One last thing. Hardy died believing that his world had no real world application. This is not true. It was just so far ahead of technology it appeared so. The math he created and also collaborated on is extremely important today.Overall very good small book. If you have interest in mathematics and the people who laid huge foundations you too will enjoy it."

Hardy wrote well about his thoughts in and about mathematics, though he lamented that the fact of writing about mathematics - not doing it - is a symbol of weakness. Nevertheless, I believe he did a correct thing to share his thoughts and philosophy with other people, in particular those who are not mathematicians but yet are appealed to it.I was mostly struck by three things. First, I am impressed by his thought that the job of a mathematician, like a painter or a composer, is to create patterns. I am also touched by his long-year collaboration and relationship with J. E. Littlewood Srinivasa Ramanujan. Finally, thanks to the words of his friend C. P. Snow, I could imagine the pressure that Hardy as a boy and as an atheist had to take, and how he found joy and peace in watching and playing cricket. All in all, I recommend this short book to anyone who is interested in mathematics. "

"" A mathematician, on the other hand, is workingwith his own mathematical reality. Of this reality, as Iexplained in §22, I take a ‘realistic’ and not an ‘idealistic’view. At any rate (and this was my main point) thisrealistic view is much more plausible of mathematicalthan of physical reality, because mathematical objectsare so much more what they seem. A chair or a star isnot in the least like what it seems to be; the more wethink of it, the fuzzier its outlines become in the hazeof sensation which surrounds it; but ‘2’ or ‘317’ hasnothing to do with sensation, and its properties standout the more clearly the more closely we scrutinizeit.""

When the world is mad, a mathematician may find in mathematics an incomparable anodyne. For mathematics is, of all the arts and sciences, the most austere and the most remote, and a mathemati- cian should be of all men the one who can most easily take refuge where, as Bertrand Russell says, ‘one at least of our nobler impulses can best escape from the dreary exile of the actual world. It is a pity that it should be necessary to make one very serious reservation—he must not be too old. Mathematics is not a contemplative but a creative subject; no one can draw much consolation from it when he has lost the power or the desire to create; and that is apt to happen to a mathematician rather soon.“"

I neither heard about him nor was I taught any significant contributions made by him. The essay by Hardy does raise some important questions although showing juxtaposed reasons like his loss of interest at one point and lack of significance in the problems he was dealing. The forward is a negative for the book which is almost half of it. While Hardy by his own admission said that Ramanujan was his greatest discovery in the field of Maths, I felt a little repelled while he was compared to people like Einstein and Bohr, giving reasons for us to read this book, which in itself is a big justification for lackluster achievements."

Disappointingly, though, I didn't get much out of it. The style wasn't particularly engaging, and the subject was somewhat dull, or at least dully approached (essentially, why mathematicians do mathematics, and to what extent it's a defensible trade). I agreed with part of the thesis, i.e. that 'real' math is generally something people do because they like it and are good at it, not so much because it's useful to society, but the essay also pushed various other ideas I don't really agree with... anyway, the problem wasn't the ideas themselves so much as how they were presented."

212,0521427061,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5636950-bob-lewis,5,"""It is a melancholy experience for a professional mathematician to find himself writing about mathematics."" Thus begins Hardy's classic essay, laying bare the melancholy subtext of what is superficially a very positive book and simultaneously casting a verbal stone at those who busy themselves with critical exposition rather than creation. With that in mind, it seems a rather perverse exercise to write a review of such a book; nevertheless, Hardy's Apology merits some reflection.Essentially, this book explains its author's philosophy of mathematics in very brief terms. Proving only two simple and classic theorems from Ancient Greek mathematics in the entire text, it is written as an explanation of the mathematician's mind and directed to the non-mathematician. It paints a portrait of a man obsessed with his field and who wants to explain to the rest of the world why. Graham Greene called it ""the best account of what it is like to be a creative artist.""Indeed, I can think of no other book that more succinctly makes the case for viewing (I would also say, though Hardy does not, for teaching) mathematics as creative art. I can also think of no time when such an argument has been more needed. Though Hardy's essay was first published in 1940 (and C. P. Snow's lengthy foreword added in 1967), it is in the early twentieth century that I think the need for a widespread appreciation of mathematics has reached its peak at the same time that popular fear of mathematics has also reached an unprecedented level. Under such circumstances, it would behoove every mathematician to consider Hardy's philosophy as much as it would benefit every non-mathematician to understand the mathematician's perspective.To be sure, there are elements of Hardy's essay with which we may disagree. He has a general distrust of mathematics as applied to engineering (as might be expected from an essay written during World War II by a man who also saw World War I) which I cannot in good conscience endorse (though his point is well-argued) and a view that widespread knowledge of scientific subjects (chemistry, for instance) is largely useless outside of the communities of professionals trained and working in related fields which I find indefensible in an increasingly democratized information economy.Still other arguments are rather outdated. There is a deep and dark irony in the idea that a mathematician passionately concerned with the applications of mathematics to war would write something like the following: ""There is one comforting conclusion which is easy for a real mathematician. Real mathematics has no effects on war. No one has yet discovered any warlike purpose to be served by the theory of numbers or relativity, and it seems very unlikely that anyone will do so for many years."" Of course, relatively birthed the atomic bomb just five years later and number theory came to be the foundation of modern cryptography within the following decades. Despite the essay's positive tone, there is a depressing thread throughout, but Hardy could never have known how false that paragraph would ring just a few short years later.Still, despite some historical incongruities and points of minor (if impassioned) disagreement, this work remains arguably the best explanation of mathematics as an aesthetic pursuit in addition to (and perhaps even above) an applied one. For that reason alone, it merits serious consideration.The inclusion of C. P. Snow's lengthy (50-page) foreword adds a great deal of benefit for the reader. While it seems odd that so short a book should merit so long an introduction, the fact of the matter is that Snow provides the essential biographical context that helps the reader understand the circumstances under which Hardy wrote. Such context transforms Hardy's essay from a mere defense of mathematics (though it is a triumph of that genre) into an examination of the human condition worthy of a novelist. In view of Hardy's life history, one cannot help but to be moved by the concluding words of section 28: ""It is a pity that it should be necessary to make one very serious reservation--he must not be too old. Mathematics is not a contemplative but a creative subject; no one can draw much consolation from it when he has lost the power or the desire to create; and that is apt to happen to a mathematician rather soon. It is a pity, but in that case he does not matter a great deal anyhow, and it would be silly to bother about him.""Incidentally, despite his monumental mathematical achievements in his own right, one of Hardy's accomplishments was his ""discovery"" of the Indian mathematician Ramanujan. Mention of their collaboration is all but absent from Hardy's words but is given deft treatment in Snow's introduction. Those who enjoyed the recent film, ""The Man Who Knew Infinity,"" or who are otherwise familiar with Ramanujan's work will find some of these anecdotes quite interesting.In sum, this is a book that can be easily read in a single sitting but which has resonated with mathematical and mathematically-curious audiences across nearly eight decades. It has done so for a very good reason and should be considered required reading even today."

When he was young, yeah sure, ambition, fame and glory. But then he came to a better understanding. He is so clear and insightful. Clearly a genius. Well worth reading.To him mathematics is a creative art and a contribution to human knowledge. He is unabashedly realist and objectivist in his approach and philosophers of mathematics can just take a hike. He draws what is to him a very clear distinction between real, serious mathematics and trivial practical mathematics. Known recipes. He talks of mining one’s way down through increasingly subtle layers to find the underlying deep patterns, and provides a few perfect examples. This is all creative and decidedly non-trivial. Something he is happy to have contributed to. One of the few things which makes life non futile. Hmm?But He is also an elitist and a snob through and through, a privileged academic who was never concerned with money or the mundane details of who was actually feeding him. After all someone has to do all the trivial work of organising and running the world and producing all the ‘stuff’. He himself is of course above all that. He rather condescendingly tells us he is proud and relieved that higher, real, pure, mathematics is above the fray and is basically of no use to anyone. ( It cannot thereby be used in war. Admittedly this was written in 1940. It is still naive.)But he is sure or at least hopeful that neither his subject - analytic number theory/primes - nor the new relativity and quantum mechanics will ever be of any practical use to anyone. And that he asserts is a good thing. The irony is dripping. Security and encryption, atomic weapons and the whole dazzling array of modern electronics and computing, respectively. But so it goes.Read the introduction/biography by CP Snow if you must, but read it last. It is placed first and is longer than the essay.It is pompous, condescending and completely misses the point, so eager is the author to impose his own fatuous interpretation,And clearly lacking in any understanding of what mathematics is really all about."
219,0521427061,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1785447-david-glenn-dixon,4,"A curiously poignant little book, undertaken only when Hardy's creative faculties had left him. This fact is telling. While he was a mathematician, the work was self-justifying. Only once he was finished with it, deprived of its pleasures, did he need to make the case that his life had been worthwhile. So an ex-mathematician's apology really.C.P. Snow's lengthy foreword, more than half the length of the main text, is a vital record of how Hardy appeared to those around him. To American ears, the Oxbridge milieu sounds stifling, claustrophobic, so concerned with rank and class that you suspect intellectual life there, for all its loftiness, was needlessly, perhaps even recklessly narrow. And this is a book of narrowing, a book about the need not to pay much attention to things outside one's purview.It's also generally condescending to those outside the world of ""real mathematics,"" not to mention those whom Hardy considered untalented in every way yet who appeared to be more or less satisfied with their lives. So Hardy comes across, in his own compressed, straitened way, as fairly desperate. However humble he attempts to make himself appear, in certain passages, he is, when not writing to convince himself, writing to convince those who cannot attain his heights that they were—Now do you see?—indeed pretty high. No one does this sort of thing without feeling embattled and without having internalized the battle until it wouldn't let him be. Which is kind of pitiful.But the strength of a memoir, should you consider this one, is how well it conveys the essence of a unique human life. And this Hardy does well.Most curiously, in his last pages Hardy writes, ""journalism is the only profession, outside academic life, in which I should have felt really confident of my chances,"" seemingly unaware that journalists must take a sincere interest in the particulars of other people's lives, something for which he has shown little aptitude at all."
220,0521427061,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28605250-douglas,5,"""A Mathematician's Apology"" is another entry in a theme of mine of reading what could at best be termed ""non-current books"". As those who know me best already know, I am on a Mathematics kick right now. I ran across a reference to ""A Mathematician's Apology"" in an obscure mathematical corner of the internet.First, apology in this context doesn't mean Hardy is sorry about Math, but rather an explanation of it. I first ran into this sense of the word in Catholic apologies and they wer certainly not sorry.I had heard the name G. H. Hardy previously, but my mental folder on him was otherwise empty. Normally I don't read forewords to books, but I made an exception this time and I was glad I did. It was written by C. P. Snow another of the names who had an empty folder in my head. It turns out both Hardy & Snow were both professors at Cambridge in England. Snow's foreword documented his friendship with Hardy and gave a brief sketch of Hardy's life.""A Mathematician's Apology"" is that rarest of mathematical books in that is has very little actual math in it. It does speak of various theories and compares and contrasts them for seriousness, which is odd to an outsider. Snow mentioned in his foreword that Hardy was depressed in his later years. Mathematics is a young man's game and Hardy was luckier than most in that he was productive into his forties.However this book makes clear toward the end that he regrets the decline of his powers. I was saddened that he was so black and white in his thinking that he couldn't see how he could contribute in other ways. Mentoring the younger generation comes to mind.All in all this was a fascinating glimpse into the mind of a genius who was used to operating on a plane far above us mere mortals."
221,0521427061,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4676613-a-w,4,"I am no mathematician. Honestly, I quickly skimmed portions of this book because they dealt with theories far, far above my head. But Hardy's introspections about himself as a man are absolutely stunning in their transparency. Aware that he had long since passed his prime, he reflects deeply on his own self-worth. As much as his ambitious and brilliant mind allows, he seems to have arrived at peace with who he was and what he accomplished. This quotation early in the book stands out: ""What we do may be small, but is has a certain character of permanence; and to have produced anything of the slightest permanent interest, whether it be a copy of verses or a geometrical theorem, is to have done something utterly beyond the powers of the vast majority of men.""But the way Hardy concludes affected me most profoundly: ""I have just one chance of escaping a verdict of complete triviality, that I may be judged to have created something worth creating. and that I have created something is undeniable: the question is about its value. 	The case for my life, then, or for that matter anyone else who has been a mathematician in the same sense in which I have been one, is this: that I have added something to knowledge, and helped others to add more; and that theses somethings have a value which differs in degree only, and not in kind, from that of the creations of the great mathematicians, or of any of the other artists, great or small, who have left some kind of memorial behind them.""This book brought a great deal of clarity to my own self-examination and causes me to recommit myself to using the talents peculiar to myself to the greatest extent, and calling that a life well-lived."
222,0521427061,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16229679-misho-okropiridze,5,"Toward the end of his distinguished career, the renowned British mathematician G.H. Hardy eloquently laid out a justification for a life of studying mathematics in A Mathematician’s Apology, an essay first published in 1940. At the center of Hardy’s defense is the thesis that mathematics is an aesthetic discipline. For Hardy, the applied mathematics of engineers and economists held little charm. “Real mathematics,” as he referred to it, “must be justified as art if it can be justified at all.”To help make his point, Hardy includes two theorems from classical Greek mathematics, which, in his opinion, possess an elusive kind of beauty that, although difficult to define, is easy to recognize. The first of these results is Euclid’s proof that there are an infinite number of prime numbers. The secondresult is the discovery, attributed to the school of Pythagoras from around 500 B.C., that square root of 2 is irrational. It is this second theorem that demands our attention. (A course in number theory would focus on the first.) The argument uses only arithmetic, but its depth and importance cannot be overstated. As Hardy says, “[It] is a ‘simple’ theorem, simple both in idea and execution, but there is no doubt at all about [it being] of the highest class. [It] is as fresh and significant as when it was discovered—two thousand years have not written a wrinkle on [it]."
223,0521427061,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4441234-neel,3,"Hardy exhibits the tendency of mathematicians to generalise, and hold whatever knowledge the possess as immutable truth. I read his words heavily salted, and in that flavour they are entertaining, sometimes even insightful, especially in the second half of the book. He is often harshly condescending in his view of other pursuits, and who he considers lesser minds, which is presumably attributable to his outstanding success in what is among the most prestigious and difficult fields, but to me it reflects a narrow mind (which may be a consequence, if not a prerequisite for his success as a mathematician). I disagree with many of his dogmatic, if not ignorant claims (for instance, that 'real' mathematics begins with the Greeks, Oriental mathematics being merely an interesting curiosity). In this he may simply be a product of his time, yet it seems his position and association with geniuses of many sorts would have given him ample opportunity to reconsider his many biases. His subject matter is of course among the most fascinating possible (at least to someone interested in art, mathematics, and philosophy) but also by its very nature difficult to talk about. As a result, if often feels like he is saying very little, but given that so little has been said about the art of mathematics, the perspective of a legendary mathematician, an undeniable expert in his art, was still interesting to read."
224,0521427061,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9309867-nedislav,5,"This book is exactly what it claims to be: An insight into the mind of a mathematician. I watched The man who knew Infinity (2015) and this essay popped up a few days later. It really gives you an impression how mathematics is an art or the purest of science. There is something so magical and mystical, something absolute and at the same time infinitely dynamic. Hardy describes various reasons to love mathematics, mainly pure mathematics, and it is just endearing to read how a man who loves what he does defends its purpose. There is not so much to say because the book is written in a lovely manner.At one point Hardy recalls a quote the Littlewood muttered, and I would not like to forget it, is:The Greeks first spoke a language which modern mathematicians can understand: as Littlewood said to me once, they are not clever schoolboys or ‘scholarship candidates’, but ‘Fellows of another college’. So Greek mathematics is ‘permanent’, more permanent even than Greek literature. Archimedes will be remembered when Aeschylus is forgotten, because languages die and mathematical ideas do not. ‘Immortality’ may be a silly word, but probably a mathematician has the best chance of whatever it may mean."

This greatly saddened me since, on the contrary, mathematics is the exact opposite. In my humble opinion, mathematics is the expression of innate ideas in the most beautiful fashion, just like poetry, painting or music. A beautiful mathematical theory, conjecture or proof is bound to overwhelm the senses just as a bewitching poem or a melodious composition.This essay characterizes the above sentiment and more. I think it must be read by non-math people, more so than their mathematical counterparts, since there is a lot more they can learn from it. The book itself has very little (ignorable imo) mathematics and is indeed written for the layperson. In this sense ignorance is wonderful, for an ignorant person can learn far more than a learned. The question ""Would you rather choose all the knowledge in the world, or an eternal pursuit of it?"" comes to mind.Highly recommend reading, it is barely a hundred pages and can be read in an hour or two.Would have been a 5/5, but the mildly misogynistic undertones leave a bad taste in my mouth. But then again, the author lived in a different era and perhaps my standards do not apply."
226,0521427061,http://goodreads.com/user/show/162013-lauren,5,"I picked this book up as a gift for a mathematician but ended up reading it myself. As other reviewers have noted, it's not only an excellent look for the layman into the mind of a mathematician, but it also provides insight into the creative process that would be of interest to anyone. As the book nears its 80th anniversary, there's some ironies that I imagine Hardy, himself, would find amusing. One of the purposes of the book is to reflect on his work from the perspective of someone who feels they are part the most useful and meaningful days. The irony, of course, is that by writing this influential book, Hardy has shown us that he still has other powers beyond mathematics, and while he may feel he's past his usefulness, A Mathematician's Apology, will shows that even in his later years he will still accomplish great things. One of the more sadder ironies of course if that in this book he prides himself that pure math (i.e. theoretical math) lacks practical applications in times of war, and so it's free from the burden of creating harm, unlike applied science. Years after his death Hardy's number theory played a role in WW II cryptography and later in creating the internet."
227,0521427061,http://goodreads.com/user/show/97125751-antonis-maronikolakis,5,"A Mathematician’s Apology by G.H. Hardy is a piece containing the author’s thoughts on Math. It can be considered as a defense for his life, work and his chosen field in Math. This is not a science textbook, it reads more like an autobiographical and philosophical piece.The foreword by Snow gives some stories about Hardy and we get to see a pretty in-depth view of his character written by one of his best friends. The second part is written by Hardy and is cut into short, easily digestible chapters. In that part we get to see Hardy’s views on Math and a mathematician’s life and purpose.From start to finish, it was a very interesting and relaxing read. It is a great peek into the life of University mathematicians of the first half of the 20th century (although it does make me a bit jealous). The language and tone is smooth and makes for a very cozy read. The book itself is short, even with the foreword by Snow, and that adds to the casual feel of the reading.All in all, the book is a very enthralling read you can casually pick up on a lazy afternoon. I thoroughly enjoyed it and I highly recommend it."

Nor do I think it does Hardy's argument (for the mathematician) any good. One of my shorter serious reads, but ended up dropping about 80% through. Some things I do not like about this book is how opinionated the author is. G.H. Hardy has good enough reasoning skills that the unprepared reader might buy into his arguments. His premises are unsubstantiated. For example, his major premise talks how futile math is for people who do not find [math] aesthetically pleasing then proceeds to build upon it. Another infamous theme of Hardy is how mathematics is not a young man's game. Then he proceeds to build upon that premise too.I went into this book interested because the title ""Apology"" is Greek. It basically means ""In defense of"" the mathematician. Usually the Greeks used apology as in Socrates Apology as a bitter realization of something. Hardy doesn't adequately define the defense. Nor is there is a strong enough case to 'defend' mathematics. 3/5"
229,0521427061,http://goodreads.com/user/show/89329444-stuart-ross,2,"Although this is a famous book by an important author, I am joining those who give it a weak review. For the generally educated person who wants to understand something more about math and mathematicians, the book might indeed be an interesting exercise. For a career mathematician of any kind, he/she might want to engage in the arguments intensely and will learn more about Hardy as a person. But for someone like me with a long-term but inermittent interest in math, the book is repetitious of arguments I have had and read dozens of times for decades, from high school to college to adulthood, so little feels new and little is conclusive. (Perhaps Hardy was one of the best at addressing the issues clearly, making me like those who criticize Shakespeare for engaging in cliches.) For any educated grown-up in 21st century America, the male perspective and snobbery that once seemed normal in brilliant academics are now off-putting"

The apology is interesting. Hardy was clearly a brilliant mathematician, and this writing is quite good. Spending time reading this was worthwhile, but I have to say that it is outdated. In particular, the great effort he makes to explain the uselessness of his work has certainly gone down the drain with the invention of computers: many mathematical theories, including several beautiful and deep corners of Hardy's beloved number theory, are essential to the functioning of computers these days! On the other hand his views on age and mathematics also are a bit ridiculous and have been proved wrong too. Nonetheless, it is a bit unfair to read this book and criticize crudely as if it was written these days. Clearly, Hardy was a man of his time and the way how we view the world and certainly mathematics, has evolved substantially (in my opinion for good!). "

However, I must admit, I usually get a bit uncomfortable whenever people start actually talking about beauty in mathematics. Obviously not because I disagree with the idea, but because you fall into this vague philosophical pit that is very hard to climb out of. Once you try to explain it, it is like it suddenly loses its purity.I do not think I have ever encountered better laid out arguments on the topic than in this book. Of course, this is partly because I am a but a kid, and not a very well read one at that. Still, I really enjoyed Hardy's carefully constructed paragraphs. Some parts, I must admit, I was not able to follow. Even after re-reading them. Hopefully, I will pick this up again in a few years. "
232,0521427061,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6546636-bob-perry,4,"It's a book that I had been meaning to read for years. Hardy is one of the giants of mathematics. I've read several biographies on mathematicians and physicists, so Hardy's name has come up often. He was an extraordinary man. The book is almost half the foreword by J.P. Snow, which adds a great deal to the book and Hardy himself. It's an interesting read and the title is legit. But it comes off as a sad statement from a creative person who knows it is all behind him. Mathematics is actually a very creative process. And Hardy was an artist in that world.One last thing. Hardy died believing that his world had no real world application. This is not true. It was just so far ahead of technology it appeared so. The math he created and also collaborated on is extremely important today.Overall very good small book.

Hardy wrote well about his thoughts in and about mathematics, though he lamented that the fact of writing about mathematics - not doing it - is a symbol of weakness. Nevertheless, I believe he did a correct thing to share his thoughts and philosophy with other people, in particular those who are not mathematicians but yet are appealed to it.I was mostly struck by three things. First, I am impressed by his thought that the job of a mathematician, like a painter or a composer, is to create patterns. I am also touched by his long-year collaboration and relationship with J. E. Littlewood Srinivasa Ramanujan. Finally, thanks to the words of his friend C. P. Snow, I could imagine the pressure that Hardy as a boy and as an atheist had to take, and how he found joy and peace in watching and playing cricket.

It is a pity that it should be necessary to make one very serious reservation—he must not be too old.

I neither heard about him nor was I taught any significant contributions made by him. The essay by Hardy does raise some important questions although showing juxtaposed reasons like his loss of interest at one point and lack of significance in the problems he was dealing. The forward is a negative for the book which is almost half of it. While Hardy by his own admission said that Ramanujan was his greatest discovery in the field of Maths, I felt a little repelled while he was compared to people like Einstein and Bohr, giving reasons for us to read this book, which in itself is a big justification for lackluster achievements."

The style wasn't particularly engaging, and the subject was somewhat dull, or at least dully approached (essentially, why mathematicians do mathematics, and to what extent it's a defensible trade). I agreed with part of the thesis, i.e. that 'real' math is generally something people do because they like it and are good at it, not so much because it's useful to society, but the essay also pushed various other ideas I don't really agree with... anyway, the problem wasn't the ideas themselves so much as how they were presented."

242,0521427061,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5636950-bob-lewis,5,"""It is a melancholy experience for a professional mathematician to find himself writing about mathematics."" Thus begins Hardy's classic essay, laying bare the melancholy subtext of what is superficially a very positive book and simultaneously casting a verbal stone at those who busy themselves with critical exposition rather than creation. With that in mind, it seems a rather perverse exercise to write a review of such a book; nevertheless, Hardy's Apology merits some reflection.Essentially, this book explains its author's philosophy of mathematics in very brief terms. Proving only two simple and classic theorems from Ancient Greek mathematics in the entire text, it is written as an explanation of the mathematician's mind and directed to the non-mathematician. It paints a portrait of a man obsessed with his field and who wants to explain to the rest of the world why. Graham Greene called it ""the best account of what it is like to be a creative artist.""Indeed, I can think of no other book that more succinctly makes the case for viewing (I would also say, though Hardy does not, for teaching) mathematics as creative art. I can also think of no time when such an argument has been more needed. Though Hardy's essay was first published in 1940 (and C. P. Snow's lengthy foreword added in 1967), it is in the early twentieth century that I think the need for a widespread appreciation of mathematics has reached its peak at the same time that popular fear of mathematics has also reached an unprecedented level. Under such circumstances, it would behoove every mathematician to consider Hardy's philosophy as much as it would benefit every non-mathematician to understand the mathematician's perspective.To be sure, there are elements of Hardy's essay with which we may disagree. He has a general distrust of mathematics as applied to engineering (as might be expected from an essay written during World War II by a man who also saw World War I) which I cannot in good conscience endorse (though his point is well-argued) and a view that widespread knowledge of scientific subjects (chemistry, for instance) is largely useless outside of the communities of professionals trained and working in related fields which I find indefensible in an increasingly democratized information economy.Still other arguments are rather outdated. There is a deep and dark irony in the idea that a mathematician passionately concerned with the applications of mathematics to war would write something like the following: ""There is one comforting conclusion which is easy for a real mathematician. Real mathematics has no effects on war. No one has yet discovered any warlike purpose to be served by the theory of numbers or relativity, and it seems very unlikely that anyone will do so for many years."" Of course, relatively birthed the atomic bomb just five years later and number theory came to be the foundation of modern cryptography within the following decades. Despite the essay's positive tone, there is a depressing thread throughout, but Hardy could never have known how false that paragraph would ring just a few short years later.Still, despite some historical incongruities and points of minor (if impassioned) disagreement, this work remains arguably the best explanation of mathematics as an aesthetic pursuit in addition to (and perhaps even above) an applied one. For that reason alone, it merits serious consideration.The inclusion of C. P. Snow's lengthy (50-page) foreword adds a great deal of benefit for the reader. While it seems odd that so short a book should merit so long an introduction, the fact of the matter is that Snow provides the essential biographical context that helps the reader understand the circumstances under which Hardy wrote. Such context transforms Hardy's essay from a mere defense of mathematics (though it is a triumph of that genre) into an examination of the human condition worthy of a novelist. In view of Hardy's life history, one cannot help but to be moved by the concluding words of section 28: ""It is a pity that it should be necessary to make one very serious reservation--he must not be too old. Mathematics is not a contemplative but a creative subject; no one can draw much consolation from it when he has lost the power or the desire to create; and that is apt to happen to a mathematician rather soon. It is a pity, but in that case he does not matter a great deal anyhow, and it would be silly to bother about him.""Incidentally, despite his monumental mathematical achievements in his own right, one of Hardy's accomplishments was his ""discovery"" of the Indian mathematician Ramanujan. Mention of their collaboration is all but absent from Hardy's words but is given deft treatment in Snow's introduction. Those who enjoyed the recent film, ""The Man Who Knew Infinity,"" or who are otherwise familiar with Ramanujan's work will find some of these anecdotes quite interesting.In sum, this is a book that can be easily read in a single sitting but which has resonated with mathematical and mathematically-curious audiences across nearly eight decades. It has done so for a very good reason and should be considered required reading even today."

When he was young, yeah sure, ambition, fame and glory. But then he came to a better understanding. He is so clear and insightful. Clearly a genius. Well worth reading.To him mathematics is a creative art and a contribution to human knowledge. He is unabashedly realist and objectivist in his approach and philosophers of mathematics can just take a hike. He draws what is to him a very clear distinction between real, serious mathematics and trivial practical mathematics. Known recipes. He talks of mining one’s way down through increasingly subtle layers to find the underlying deep patterns, and provides a few perfect examples. This is all creative and decidedly non-trivial. Something he is happy to have contributed to. One of the few things which makes life non futile. Hmm?But He is also an elitist and a snob through and through, a privileged academic who was never concerned with money or the mundane details of who was actually feeding him. After all someone has to do all the trivial work of organising and running the world and producing all the ‘stuff’. He himself is of course above all that. He rather condescendingly tells us he is proud and relieved that higher, real, pure, mathematics is above the fray and is basically of no use to anyone. ( It cannot thereby be used in war. Admittedly this was written in 1940. It is still naive.)But he is sure or at least hopeful that neither his subject - analytic number theory/primes - nor the new relativity and quantum mechanics will ever be of any practical use to anyone. And that he asserts is a good thing. The irony is dripping. Security and encryption, atomic weapons and the whole dazzling array of modern electronics and computing, respectively. But so it goes.Read the introduction/biography by CP Snow if you must, but read it last. It is placed first and is longer than the essay.It is pompous, condescending and completely misses the point, so eager is the author to impose his own fatuous interpretation,And clearly lacking in any understanding of what mathematics is really all about."
249,0521427061,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1785447-david-glenn-dixon,4,"A curiously poignant little book, undertaken only when Hardy's creative faculties had left him. This fact is telling. While he was a mathematician, the work was self-justifying. Only once he was finished with it, deprived of its pleasures, did he need to make the case that his life had been worthwhile. So an ex-mathematician's apology really.C.P. Snow's lengthy foreword, more than half the length of the main text, is a vital record of how Hardy appeared to those around him. To American ears, the Oxbridge milieu sounds stifling, claustrophobic, so concerned with rank and class that you suspect intellectual life there, for all its loftiness, was needlessly, perhaps even recklessly narrow. And this is a book of narrowing, a book about the need not to pay much attention to things outside one's purview.It's also generally condescending to those outside the world of ""real mathematics,"" not to mention those whom Hardy considered untalented in every way yet who appeared to be more or less satisfied with their lives. So Hardy comes across, in his own compressed, straitened way, as fairly desperate. However humble he attempts to make himself appear, in certain passages, he is, when not writing to convince himself, writing to convince those who cannot attain his heights that they were—Now do you see?—indeed pretty high. No one does this sort of thing without feeling embattled and without having internalized the battle until it wouldn't let him be. Which is kind of pitiful.But the strength of a memoir, should you consider this one, is how well it conveys the essence of a unique human life. And this Hardy does well.Most curiously, in his last pages Hardy writes, ""journalism is the only profession, outside academic life, in which I should have felt really confident of my chances,"" seemingly unaware that journalists must take a sincere interest in the particulars of other people's lives, something for which he has shown little aptitude at all."

As those who know me best already know, I am on a Mathematics kick right now. I ran across a reference to ""A Mathematician's Apology"" in an obscure mathematical corner of the internet.First, apology in this context doesn't mean Hardy is sorry about Math, but rather an explanation of it. I first ran into this sense of the word in Catholic apologies and they wer certainly not sorry.I had heard the name G. H. Hardy previously, but my mental folder on him was otherwise empty. Normally I don't read forewords to books, but I made an exception this time and I was glad I did. It was written by C. P. Snow another of the names who had an empty folder in my head. It turns out both Hardy & Snow were both professors at Cambridge in England. Snow's foreword documented his friendship with Hardy and gave a brief sketch of Hardy's life.""A Mathematician's Apology"" is that rarest of mathematical books in that is has very little actual math in it. It does speak of various theories and compares and contrasts them for seriousness, which is odd to an outsider. Snow mentioned in his foreword that Hardy was depressed in his later years. Mathematics is a young man's game and Hardy was luckier than most in that he was productive into his forties.However this book makes clear toward the end that he regrets the decline of his powers. I was saddened that he was so black and white in his thinking that he couldn't see how he could contribute in other ways. Mentoring the younger generation comes to mind.All in all this was a fascinating glimpse into the mind of a genius who was used to operating on a plane far above us mere mortals."
251,0521427061,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4676613-a-w,4,"I am no mathematician. Honestly, I quickly skimmed portions of this book because they dealt with theories far, far above my head. But Hardy's introspections about himself as a man are absolutely stunning in their transparency. Aware that he had long since passed his prime, he reflects deeply on his own self-worth. As much as his ambitious and brilliant mind allows, he seems to have arrived at peace with who he was and what he accomplished. This quotation early in the book stands out: ""What we do may be small, but is has a certain character of permanence; and to have produced anything of the slightest permanent interest, whether it be a copy of verses or a geometrical theorem, is to have done something utterly beyond the powers of the vast majority of men.""But the way Hardy concludes affected me most profoundly: ""I have just one chance of escaping a verdict of complete triviality, that I may be judged to have created something worth creating. and that I have created something is undeniable: the question is about its value. 	The case for my life, then, or for that matter anyone else who has been a mathematician in the same sense in which I have been one, is this: that I have added something to knowledge, and helped others to add more; and that theses somethings have a value which differs in degree only, and not in kind, from that of the creations of the great mathematicians, or of any of the other artists, great or small, who have left some kind of memorial behind them.""This book brought a great deal of clarity to my own self-examination and causes me to recommit myself to using the talents peculiar to myself to the greatest extent, and calling that a life well-lived."
252,0521427061,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16229679-misho-okropiridze,5,"Toward the end of his distinguished career, the renowned British mathematician G.H. Hardy eloquently laid out a justification for a life of studying mathematics in A Mathematician’s Apology, an essay first published in 1940. At the center of Hardy’s defense is the thesis that mathematics is an aesthetic discipline. For Hardy, the applied mathematics of engineers and economists held little charm. “Real mathematics,” as he referred to it, “must be justified as art if it can be justified at all.”To help make his point, Hardy includes two theorems from classical Greek mathematics, which, in his opinion, possess an elusive kind of beauty that, although difficult to define, is easy to recognize. The first of these results is Euclid’s proof that there are an infinite number of prime numbers. The secondresult is the discovery, attributed to the school of Pythagoras from around 500 B.C., that square root of 2 is irrational. It is this second theorem that demands our attention. (A course in number theory would focus on the first.) The argument uses only arithmetic, but its depth and importance cannot be overstated. As Hardy says, “[It] is a ‘simple’ theorem, simple both in idea and execution, but there is no doubt at all about [it being] of the highest class. [It] is as fresh and significant as when it was discovered—two thousand years have not written a wrinkle on [it]."
253,0521427061,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4441234-neel,3,"Hardy exhibits the tendency of mathematicians to generalise, and hold whatever knowledge the possess as immutable truth. I read his words heavily salted, and in that flavour they are entertaining, sometimes even insightful, especially in the second half of the book. He is often harshly condescending in his view of other pursuits, and who he considers lesser minds, which is presumably attributable to his outstanding success in what is among the most prestigious and difficult fields, but to me it reflects a narrow mind (which may be a consequence, if not a prerequisite for his success as a mathematician). I disagree with many of his dogmatic, if not ignorant claims (for instance, that 'real' mathematics begins with the Greeks, Oriental mathematics being merely an interesting curiosity). In this he may simply be a product of his time, yet it seems his position and association with geniuses of many sorts would have given him ample opportunity to reconsider his many biases. His subject matter is of course among the most fascinating possible (at least to someone interested in art, mathematics, and philosophy) but also by its very nature difficult to talk about. As a result, if often feels like he is saying very little, but given that so little has been said about the art of mathematics, the perspective of a legendary mathematician, an undeniable expert in his art, was still interesting to read."
254,0521427061,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9309867-nedislav,5,"This book is exactly what it claims to be: An insight into the mind of a mathematician. I watched The man who knew Infinity (2015) and this essay popped up a few days later. It really gives you an impression how mathematics is an art or the purest of science. There is something so magical and mystical, something absolute and at the same time infinitely dynamic. Hardy describes various reasons to love mathematics, mainly pure mathematics, and it is just endearing to read how a man who loves what he does defends its purpose. There is not so much to say because the book is written in a lovely manner.At one point Hardy recalls a quote the Littlewood muttered, and I would not like to forget it, is:The Greeks first spoke a language which modern mathematicians can understand: as Littlewood said to me once, they are not clever schoolboys or ‘scholarship candidates’, but ‘Fellows of another college’. So Greek mathematics is ‘permanent’, more permanent even than Greek literature. Archimedes will be remembered when Aeschylus is forgotten, because languages die and mathematical ideas do not. ‘Immortality’ may be a silly word, but probably a mathematician has the best chance of whatever it may mean."

This greatly saddened me since, on the contrary, mathematics is the exact opposite. In my humble opinion, mathematics is the expression of innate ideas in the most beautiful fashion, just like poetry, painting or music. A beautiful mathematical theory, conjecture or proof is bound to overwhelm the senses just as a bewitching poem or a melodious composition.This essay characterizes the above sentiment and more. I think it must be read by non-math people, more so than their mathematical counterparts, since there is a lot more they can learn from it. The book itself has very little (ignorable imo) mathematics and is indeed written for the layperson. In this sense ignorance is wonderful, for an ignorant person can learn far more than a learned. The question ""Would you rather choose all the knowledge in the world, or an eternal pursuit of it?"" comes to mind.Highly recommend reading, it is barely a hundred pages and can be read in an hour or two.Would have been a 5/5, but the mildly misogynistic undertones leave a bad taste in my mouth.

256,0521427061,http://goodreads.com/user/show/162013-lauren,5,"I picked this book up as a gift for a mathematician but ended up reading it myself. As other reviewers have noted, it's not only an excellent look for the layman into the mind of a mathematician, but it also provides insight into the creative process that would be of interest to anyone. As the book nears its 80th anniversary, there's some ironies that I imagine Hardy, himself, would find amusing. One of the purposes of the book is to reflect on his work from the perspective of someone who feels they are part the most useful and meaningful days. The irony, of course, is that by writing this influential book, Hardy has shown us that he still has other powers beyond mathematics, and while he may feel he's past his usefulness, A Mathematician's Apology, will shows that even in his later years he will still accomplish great things. One of the more sadder ironies of course if that in this book he prides himself that pure math (i.e. theoretical math) lacks practical applications in times of war, and so it's free from the burden of creating harm, unlike applied science. Years after his death Hardy's number theory played a role in WW II cryptography and later in creating the internet."

It can be considered as a defense for his life, work and his chosen field in Math. This is not a science textbook, it reads more like an autobiographical and philosophical piece.The foreword by Snow gives some stories about Hardy and we get to see a pretty in-depth view of his character written by one of his best friends. The second part is written by Hardy and is cut into short, easily digestible chapters. In that part we get to see Hardy’s views on Math and a mathematician’s life and purpose.From start to finish, it was a very interesting and relaxing read. It is a great peek into the life of University mathematicians of the first half of the 20th century (although it does make me a bit jealous). The language and tone is smooth and makes for a very cozy read. The book itself is short, even with the foreword by Snow, and that adds to the casual feel of the reading.All in all, the book is a very enthralling read you can casually pick up on a lazy afternoon. I thoroughly enjoyed it and I highly recommend it."

Nor do I think it does Hardy's argument (for the mathematician) any good. One of my shorter serious reads, but ended up dropping about 80% through. Some things I do not like about this book is how opinionated the author is. G.H. Hardy has good enough reasoning skills that the unprepared reader might buy into his arguments. His premises are unsubstantiated. For example, his major premise talks how futile math is for people who do not find [math] aesthetically pleasing then proceeds to build upon it. Another infamous theme of Hardy is how mathematics is not a young man's game. Then he proceeds to build upon that premise too.I went into this book interested because the title ""Apology"" is Greek. It basically means ""In defense of"" the mathematician. Usually the Greeks used apology as in Socrates Apology as a bitter realization of something. Hardy doesn't adequately define the defense. Nor is there is a strong enough case to 'defend' mathematics. 3/5"

For the generally educated person who wants to understand something more about math and mathematicians, the book might indeed be an interesting exercise. For a career mathematician of any kind, he/she might want to engage in the arguments intensely and will learn more about Hardy as a person. But for someone like me with a long-term but inermittent interest in math, the book is repetitious of arguments I have had and read dozens of times for decades, from high school to college to adulthood, so little feels new and little is conclusive. (Perhaps Hardy was one of the best at addressing the issues clearly, making me like those who criticize Shakespeare for engaging in cliches.) For any educated grown-up in 21st century America, the male perspective and snobbery that once seemed normal in brilliant academics are now off-putting"

In particular, the great effort he makes to explain the uselessness of his work has certainly gone down the drain with the invention of computers: many mathematical theories, including several beautiful and deep corners of Hardy's beloved number theory, are essential to the functioning of computers these days! On the other hand his views on age and mathematics also are a bit ridiculous and have been proved wrong too. Nonetheless, it is a bit unfair to read this book and criticize crudely as if it was written these days. Clearly, Hardy was a man of his time and the way how we view the world and certainly mathematics, has evolved substantially (in my opinion for good!). "
261,0521427061,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10633326-ida,5,"There is something very appealing about the aesthetic abstraction in mathematics. It is hard to put into words the feeling of being able to follow all the steps in a proof. The lack logical inconsistencies. The sense of universality. However, I must admit, I usually get a bit uncomfortable whenever people start actually talking about beauty in mathematics. Obviously not because I disagree with the idea, but because you fall into this vague philosophical pit that is very hard to climb out of. Once you try to explain it, it is like it suddenly loses its purity.I do not think I have ever encountered better laid out arguments on the topic than in this book. Of course, this is partly because I am a but a kid, and not a very well read one at that. Still, I really enjoyed Hardy's carefully constructed paragraphs. Some parts, I must admit, I was not able to follow. Even after re-reading them. Hopefully, I will pick this up again in a few years. "
262,0521427061,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6546636-bob-perry,4,"It's a book that I had been meaning to read for years. Hardy is one of the giants of mathematics. I've read several biographies on mathematicians and physicists, so Hardy's name has come up often. He was an extraordinary man. The book is almost half the foreword by J.P. Snow, which adds a great deal to the book and Hardy himself. It's an interesting read and the title is legit. But it comes off as a sad statement from a creative person who knows it is all behind him. Mathematics is actually a very creative process. And Hardy was an artist in that world.One last thing. Hardy died believing that his world had no real world application. This is not true. It was just so far ahead of technology it appeared so. The math he created and also collaborated on is extremely important today.Overall very good small book.

Hardy wrote well about his thoughts in and about mathematics, though he lamented that the fact of writing about mathematics - not doing it - is a symbol of weakness. Nevertheless, I believe he did a correct thing to share his thoughts and philosophy with other people, in particular those who are not mathematicians but yet are appealed to it.I was mostly struck by three things. First, I am impressed by his thought that the job of a mathematician, like a painter or a composer, is to create patterns. I am also touched by his long-year collaboration and relationship with J. E. Littlewood Srinivasa Ramanujan. Finally, thanks to the words of his friend C. P. Snow, I could imagine the pressure that Hardy as a boy and as an atheist had to take, and how he found joy and peace in watching and playing cricket. All in all, I recommend this short book to anyone who is interested in mathematics. "

It is a pity that it should be necessary to make one very serious reservation—he must not be too old.

I neither heard about him nor was I taught any significant contributions made by him. The essay by Hardy does raise some important questions although showing juxtaposed reasons like his loss of interest at one point and lack of significance in the problems he was dealing. The forward is a negative for the book which is almost half of it. While Hardy by his own admission said that Ramanujan was his greatest discovery in the field of Maths, I felt a little repelled while he was compared to people like Einstein and Bohr, giving reasons for us to read this book, which in itself is a big justification for lackluster achievements."

Disappointingly, though, I didn't get much out of it. The style wasn't particularly engaging, and the subject was somewhat dull, or at least dully approached (essentially, why mathematicians do mathematics, and to what extent it's a defensible trade). I agreed with part of the thesis, i.e. that 'real' math is generally something people do because they like it and are good at it, not so much because it's useful to society, but the essay also pushed various other ideas I don't really agree with... anyway, the problem wasn't the ideas themselves so much as how they were presented."

272,0521427061,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5636950-bob-lewis,5,"""It is a melancholy experience for a professional mathematician to find himself writing about mathematics."" Thus begins Hardy's classic essay, laying bare the melancholy subtext of what is superficially a very positive book and simultaneously casting a verbal stone at those who busy themselves with critical exposition rather than creation. With that in mind, it seems a rather perverse exercise to write a review of such a book; nevertheless, Hardy's Apology merits some reflection.Essentially, this book explains its author's philosophy of mathematics in very brief terms. Proving only two simple and classic theorems from Ancient Greek mathematics in the entire text, it is written as an explanation of the mathematician's mind and directed to the non-mathematician. It paints a portrait of a man obsessed with his field and who wants to explain to the rest of the world why. Graham Greene called it ""the best account of what it is like to be a creative artist.""Indeed, I can think of no other book that more succinctly makes the case for viewing (I would also say, though Hardy does not, for teaching) mathematics as creative art. I can also think of no time when such an argument has been more needed. Though Hardy's essay was first published in 1940 (and C. P. Snow's lengthy foreword added in 1967), it is in the early twentieth century that I think the need for a widespread appreciation of mathematics has reached its peak at the same time that popular fear of mathematics has also reached an unprecedented level. Under such circumstances, it would behoove every mathematician to consider Hardy's philosophy as much as it would benefit every non-mathematician to understand the mathematician's perspective.To be sure, there are elements of Hardy's essay with which we may disagree. He has a general distrust of mathematics as applied to engineering (as might be expected from an essay written during World War II by a man who also saw World War I) which I cannot in good conscience endorse (though his point is well-argued) and a view that widespread knowledge of scientific subjects (chemistry, for instance) is largely useless outside of the communities of professionals trained and working in related fields which I find indefensible in an increasingly democratized information economy.Still other arguments are rather outdated. There is a deep and dark irony in the idea that a mathematician passionately concerned with the applications of mathematics to war would write something like the following: ""There is one comforting conclusion which is easy for a real mathematician. Real mathematics has no effects on war. No one has yet discovered any warlike purpose to be served by the theory of numbers or relativity, and it seems very unlikely that anyone will do so for many years."" Of course, relatively birthed the atomic bomb just five years later and number theory came to be the foundation of modern cryptography within the following decades. Despite the essay's positive tone, there is a depressing thread throughout, but Hardy could never have known how false that paragraph would ring just a few short years later.Still, despite some historical incongruities and points of minor (if impassioned) disagreement, this work remains arguably the best explanation of mathematics as an aesthetic pursuit in addition to (and perhaps even above) an applied one. For that reason alone, it merits serious consideration.The inclusion of C. P. Snow's lengthy (50-page) foreword adds a great deal of benefit for the reader. While it seems odd that so short a book should merit so long an introduction, the fact of the matter is that Snow provides the essential biographical context that helps the reader understand the circumstances under which Hardy wrote. Such context transforms Hardy's essay from a mere defense of mathematics (though it is a triumph of that genre) into an examination of the human condition worthy of a novelist. In view of Hardy's life history, one cannot help but to be moved by the concluding words of section 28: ""It is a pity that it should be necessary to make one very serious reservation--he must not be too old. Mathematics is not a contemplative but a creative subject; no one can draw much consolation from it when he has lost the power or the desire to create; and that is apt to happen to a mathematician rather soon. It is a pity, but in that case he does not matter a great deal anyhow, and it would be silly to bother about him.""Incidentally, despite his monumental mathematical achievements in his own right, one of Hardy's accomplishments was his ""discovery"" of the Indian mathematician Ramanujan. Mention of their collaboration is all but absent from Hardy's words but is given deft treatment in Snow's introduction. Those who enjoyed the recent film, ""The Man Who Knew Infinity,"" or who are otherwise familiar with Ramanujan's work will find some of these anecdotes quite interesting.In sum, this is a book that can be easily read in a single sitting but which has resonated with mathematical and mathematically-curious audiences across nearly eight decades. It has done so for a very good reason and should be considered required reading even today."

When he was young, yeah sure, ambition, fame and glory. But then he came to a better understanding. He is so clear and insightful. Clearly a genius. Well worth reading.To him mathematics is a creative art and a contribution to human knowledge. He is unabashedly realist and objectivist in his approach and philosophers of mathematics can just take a hike. He draws what is to him a very clear distinction between real, serious mathematics and trivial practical mathematics. Known recipes. He talks of mining one’s way down through increasingly subtle layers to find the underlying deep patterns, and provides a few perfect examples. This is all creative and decidedly non-trivial. Something he is happy to have contributed to. One of the few things which makes life non futile. Hmm?But He is also an elitist and a snob through and through, a privileged academic who was never concerned with money or the mundane details of who was actually feeding him. After all someone has to do all the trivial work of organising and running the world and producing all the ‘stuff’. He himself is of course above all that. He rather condescendingly tells us he is proud and relieved that higher, real, pure, mathematics is above the fray and is basically of no use to anyone. ( It cannot thereby be used in war. Admittedly this was written in 1940. It is still naive.)But he is sure or at least hopeful that neither his subject - analytic number theory/primes - nor the new relativity and quantum mechanics will ever be of any practical use to anyone. And that he asserts is a good thing. The irony is dripping. Security and encryption, atomic weapons and the whole dazzling array of modern electronics and computing, respectively. But so it goes.Read the introduction/biography by CP Snow if you must, but read it last. It is placed first and is longer than the essay.It is pompous, condescending and completely misses the point, so eager is the author to impose his own fatuous interpretation,And clearly lacking in any understanding of what mathematics is really all about."
279,0521427061,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1785447-david-glenn-dixon,4,"A curiously poignant little book, undertaken only when Hardy's creative faculties had left him. This fact is telling. While he was a mathematician, the work was self-justifying. Only once he was finished with it, deprived of its pleasures, did he need to make the case that his life had been worthwhile. So an ex-mathematician's apology really.C.P. Snow's lengthy foreword, more than half the length of the main text, is a vital record of how Hardy appeared to those around him. To American ears, the Oxbridge milieu sounds stifling, claustrophobic, so concerned with rank and class that you suspect intellectual life there, for all its loftiness, was needlessly, perhaps even recklessly narrow. And this is a book of narrowing, a book about the need not to pay much attention to things outside one's purview.It's also generally condescending to those outside the world of ""real mathematics,"" not to mention those whom Hardy considered untalented in every way yet who appeared to be more or less satisfied with their lives. So Hardy comes across, in his own compressed, straitened way, as fairly desperate. However humble he attempts to make himself appear, in certain passages, he is, when not writing to convince himself, writing to convince those who cannot attain his heights that they were—Now do you see?—indeed pretty high. No one does this sort of thing without feeling embattled and without having internalized the battle until it wouldn't let him be. Which is kind of pitiful.But the strength of a memoir, should you consider this one, is how well it conveys the essence of a unique human life. And this Hardy does well.Most curiously, in his last pages Hardy writes, ""journalism is the only profession, outside academic life, in which I should have felt really confident of my chances,"" seemingly unaware that journalists must take a sincere interest in the particulars of other people's lives, something for which he has shown little aptitude at all."

As those who know me best already know, I am on a Mathematics kick right now. I ran across a reference to ""A Mathematician's Apology"" in an obscure mathematical corner of the internet.First, apology in this context doesn't mean Hardy is sorry about Math, but rather an explanation of it. I first ran into this sense of the word in Catholic apologies and they wer certainly not sorry.I had heard the name G. H. Hardy previously, but my mental folder on him was otherwise empty. Normally I don't read forewords to books, but I made an exception this time and I was glad I did. It was written by C. P. Snow another of the names who had an empty folder in my head. It turns out both Hardy & Snow were both professors at Cambridge in England. Snow's foreword documented his friendship with Hardy and gave a brief sketch of Hardy's life.""A Mathematician's Apology"" is that rarest of mathematical books in that is has very little actual math in it. It does speak of various theories and compares and contrasts them for seriousness, which is odd to an outsider. Snow mentioned in his foreword that Hardy was depressed in his later years. Mathematics is a young man's game and Hardy was luckier than most in that he was productive into his forties.However this book makes clear toward the end that he regrets the decline of his powers. I was saddened that he was so black and white in his thinking that he couldn't see how he could contribute in other ways. Mentoring the younger generation comes to mind.All in all this was a fascinating glimpse into the mind of a genius who was used to operating on a plane far above us mere mortals."
281,0521427061,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4676613-a-w,4,"I am no mathematician. Honestly, I quickly skimmed portions of this book because they dealt with theories far, far above my head. But Hardy's introspections about himself as a man are absolutely stunning in their transparency. Aware that he had long since passed his prime, he reflects deeply on his own self-worth. As much as his ambitious and brilliant mind allows, he seems to have arrived at peace with who he was and what he accomplished. This quotation early in the book stands out: ""What we do may be small, but is has a certain character of permanence; and to have produced anything of the slightest permanent interest, whether it be a copy of verses or a geometrical theorem, is to have done something utterly beyond the powers of the vast majority of men.""But the way Hardy concludes affected me most profoundly: ""I have just one chance of escaping a verdict of complete triviality, that I may be judged to have created something worth creating. and that I have created something is undeniable: the question is about its value. 	The case for my life, then, or for that matter anyone else who has been a mathematician in the same sense in which I have been one, is this: that I have added something to knowledge, and helped others to add more; and that theses somethings have a value which differs in degree only, and not in kind, from that of the creations of the great mathematicians, or of any of the other artists, great or small, who have left some kind of memorial behind them.""This book brought a great deal of clarity to my own self-examination and causes me to recommit myself to using the talents peculiar to myself to the greatest extent, and calling that a life well-lived."
282,0521427061,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16229679-misho-okropiridze,5,"Toward the end of his distinguished career, the renowned British mathematician G.H. Hardy eloquently laid out a justification for a life of studying mathematics in A Mathematician’s Apology, an essay first published in 1940. At the center of Hardy’s defense is the thesis that mathematics is an aesthetic discipline. For Hardy, the applied mathematics of engineers and economists held little charm. “Real mathematics,” as he referred to it, “must be justified as art if it can be justified at all.”To help make his point, Hardy includes two theorems from classical Greek mathematics, which, in his opinion, possess an elusive kind of beauty that, although difficult to define, is easy to recognize. The first of these results is Euclid’s proof that there are an infinite number of prime numbers. The secondresult is the discovery, attributed to the school of Pythagoras from around 500 B.C., that square root of 2 is irrational. It is this second theorem that demands our attention. (A course in number theory would focus on the first.) The argument uses only arithmetic, but its depth and importance cannot be overstated. As Hardy says, “[It] is a ‘simple’ theorem, simple both in idea and execution, but there is no doubt at all about [it being] of the highest class. [It] is as fresh and significant as when it was discovered—two thousand years have not written a wrinkle on [it]."
283,0521427061,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4441234-neel,3,"Hardy exhibits the tendency of mathematicians to generalise, and hold whatever knowledge the possess as immutable truth. I read his words heavily salted, and in that flavour they are entertaining, sometimes even insightful, especially in the second half of the book. He is often harshly condescending in his view of other pursuits, and who he considers lesser minds, which is presumably attributable to his outstanding success in what is among the most prestigious and difficult fields, but to me it reflects a narrow mind (which may be a consequence, if not a prerequisite for his success as a mathematician). I disagree with many of his dogmatic, if not ignorant claims (for instance, that 'real' mathematics begins with the Greeks, Oriental mathematics being merely an interesting curiosity). In this he may simply be a product of his time, yet it seems his position and association with geniuses of many sorts would have given him ample opportunity to reconsider his many biases. His subject matter is of course among the most fascinating possible (at least to someone interested in art, mathematics, and philosophy) but also by its very nature difficult to talk about. As a result, if often feels like he is saying very little, but given that so little has been said about the art of mathematics, the perspective of a legendary mathematician, an undeniable expert in his art, was still interesting to read."
284,0521427061,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9309867-nedislav,5,"This book is exactly what it claims to be: An insight into the mind of a mathematician. I watched The man who knew Infinity (2015) and this essay popped up a few days later. It really gives you an impression how mathematics is an art or the purest of science. There is something so magical and mystical, something absolute and at the same time infinitely dynamic. Hardy describes various reasons to love mathematics, mainly pure mathematics, and it is just endearing to read how a man who loves what he does defends its purpose. There is not so much to say because the book is written in a lovely manner.At one point Hardy recalls a quote the Littlewood muttered, and I would not like to forget it, is:The Greeks first spoke a language which modern mathematicians can understand: as Littlewood said to me once, they are not clever schoolboys or ‘scholarship candidates’, but ‘Fellows of another college’. So Greek mathematics is ‘permanent’, more permanent even than Greek literature. Archimedes will be remembered when Aeschylus is forgotten, because languages die and mathematical ideas do not. ‘Immortality’ may be a silly word, but probably a mathematician has the best chance of whatever it may mean."

This greatly saddened me since, on the contrary, mathematics is the exact opposite. In my humble opinion, mathematics is the expression of innate ideas in the most beautiful fashion, just like poetry, painting or music. A beautiful mathematical theory, conjecture or proof is bound to overwhelm the senses just as a bewitching poem or a melodious composition.This essay characterizes the above sentiment and more. I think it must be read by non-math people, more so than their mathematical counterparts, since there is a lot more they can learn from it. The book itself has very little (ignorable imo) mathematics and is indeed written for the layperson. In this sense ignorance is wonderful, for an ignorant person can learn far more than a learned. The question ""Would you rather choose all the knowledge in the world, or an eternal pursuit of it?"" comes to mind.Highly recommend reading, it is barely a hundred pages and can be read in an hour or two.Would have been a 5/5, but the mildly misogynistic undertones leave a bad taste in my mouth.

286,0521427061,http://goodreads.com/user/show/162013-lauren,5,"I picked this book up as a gift for a mathematician but ended up reading it myself. As other reviewers have noted, it's not only an excellent look for the layman into the mind of a mathematician, but it also provides insight into the creative process that would be of interest to anyone. As the book nears its 80th anniversary, there's some ironies that I imagine Hardy, himself, would find amusing. One of the purposes of the book is to reflect on his work from the perspective of someone who feels they are part the most useful and meaningful days. The irony, of course, is that by writing this influential book, Hardy has shown us that he still has other powers beyond mathematics, and while he may feel he's past his usefulness, A Mathematician's Apology, will shows that even in his later years he will still accomplish great things. One of the more sadder ironies of course if that in this book he prides himself that pure math (i.e. theoretical math) lacks practical applications in times of war, and so it's free from the burden of creating harm, unlike applied science. Years after his death Hardy's number theory played a role in WW II cryptography and later in creating the internet."

It can be considered as a defense for his life, work and his chosen field in Math. This is not a science textbook, it reads more like an autobiographical and philosophical piece.The foreword by Snow gives some stories about Hardy and we get to see a pretty in-depth view of his character written by one of his best friends. The second part is written by Hardy and is cut into short, easily digestible chapters. In that part we get to see Hardy’s views on Math and a mathematician’s life and purpose.From start to finish, it was a very interesting and relaxing read. It is a great peek into the life of University mathematicians of the first half of the 20th century (although it does make me a bit jealous). The language and tone is smooth and makes for a very cozy read. The book itself is short, even with the foreword by Snow, and that adds to the casual feel of the reading.All in all, the book is a very enthralling read you can casually pick up on a lazy afternoon.

Nor do I think it does Hardy's argument (for the mathematician) any good. One of my shorter serious reads, but ended up dropping about 80% through. Some things I do not like about this book is how opinionated the author is. G.H. Hardy has good enough reasoning skills that the unprepared reader might buy into his arguments. His premises are unsubstantiated. For example, his major premise talks how futile math is for people who do not find [math] aesthetically pleasing then proceeds to build upon it. Another infamous theme of Hardy is how mathematics is not a young man's game. Then he proceeds to build upon that premise too.I went into this book interested because the title ""Apology"" is Greek. It basically means ""In defense of"" the mathematician. Usually the Greeks used apology as in Socrates Apology as a bitter realization of something. Hardy doesn't adequately define the defense. Nor is there is a strong enough case to 'defend' mathematics. 3/5"

For a career mathematician of any kind, he/she might want to engage in the arguments intensely and will learn more about Hardy as a person. But for someone like me with a long-term but inermittent interest in math, the book is repetitious of arguments I have had and read dozens of times for decades, from high school to college to adulthood, so little feels new and little is conclusive. (Perhaps Hardy was one of the best at addressing the issues clearly, making me like those who criticize Shakespeare for engaging in cliches.) For any educated grown-up in 21st century America, the male perspective and snobbery that once seemed normal in brilliant academics are now off-putting"
290,0521427061,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69594272-jose-samper,4,"Let me start by saying I did not read this edition, but one that I found online. I also did not read Snow's comment. The apology is interesting. Hardy was clearly a brilliant mathematician, and this writing is quite good. Spending time reading this was worthwhile, but I have to say that it is outdated. In particular, the great effort he makes to explain the uselessness of his work has certainly gone down the drain with the invention of computers: many mathematical theories, including several beautiful and deep corners of Hardy's beloved number theory, are essential to the functioning of computers these days! On the other hand his views on age and mathematics also are a bit ridiculous and have been proved wrong too. Nonetheless, it is a bit unfair to read this book and criticize crudely as if it was written these days. Clearly, Hardy was a man of his time and the way how we view the world and certainly mathematics, has evolved substantially (in my opinion for good!). "
291,0521427061,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10633326-ida,5,"There is something very appealing about the aesthetic abstraction in mathematics. It is hard to put into words the feeling of being able to follow all the steps in a proof. The lack logical inconsistencies. The sense of universality. However, I must admit, I usually get a bit uncomfortable whenever people start actually talking about beauty in mathematics. Obviously not because I disagree with the idea, but because you fall into this vague philosophical pit that is very hard to climb out of. Once you try to explain it, it is like it suddenly loses its purity.I do not think I have ever encountered better laid out arguments on the topic than in this book. Of course, this is partly because I am a but a kid, and not a very well read one at that. Still, I really enjoyed Hardy's carefully constructed paragraphs. Some parts, I must admit, I was not able to follow. Even after re-reading them. Hopefully, I will pick this up again in a few years. "
292,0521427061,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6546636-bob-perry,4,"It's a book that I had been meaning to read for years. Hardy is one of the giants of mathematics. I've read several biographies on mathematicians and physicists, so Hardy's name has come up often. He was an extraordinary man. The book is almost half the foreword by J.P. Snow, which adds a great deal to the book and Hardy himself. It's an interesting read and the title is legit. But it comes off as a sad statement from a creative person who knows it is all behind him. Mathematics is actually a very creative process. And Hardy was an artist in that world.One last thing. Hardy died believing that his world had no real world application. This is not true. It was just so far ahead of technology it appeared so. The math he created and also collaborated on is extremely important today.Overall very good small book. If you have interest in mathematics and the people who laid huge foundations you too will enjoy it."
293,0521427061,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16397506-dietmar,4,"G. H. Hardy wrote well about his thoughts in and about mathematics, though he lamented that the fact of writing about mathematics - not doing it - is a symbol of weakness. Nevertheless, I believe he did a correct thing to share his thoughts and philosophy with other people, in particular those who are not mathematicians but yet are appealed to it.I was mostly struck by three things. First, I am impressed by his thought that the job of a mathematician, like a painter or a composer, is to create patterns. I am also touched by his long-year collaboration and relationship with J. E. Littlewood Srinivasa Ramanujan. Finally, thanks to the words of his friend C. P. Snow, I could imagine the pressure that Hardy as a boy and as an atheist had to take, and how he found joy and peace in watching and playing cricket. All in all, I recommend this short book to anyone who is interested in mathematics. "
294,0521427061,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72122998-pablo-felgueres,4,"Essay on what it takes to be a mathematician and why its pursuit is worthwhile.As an engineer I don’t understand what lies beyond algebra and calculus so this book shed light into the appealing traits of pure math and the character of those that make it their life, for as much as they can.Hardy’s cut throat honesty and a repellent attitude to political correctness is surprisingly refreshing for our “woked” days.It invites you to recognize the persisting relevance of math across centuries, the realness of math ideas in that they as close as you’ll get to truth and a particular underlining of the character and discipline required to attempt pushing its frontiers.The advancement of maths is portrayed as a subject left for those with an innate talent for it, the fresh ideas of the youth and decades of rigorous thought.This essay is a reminder of the extent you’ll need to sacrifice in order to make a worthy contribution in your discipline."
295,0521427061,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59740307-bill,5,"Some points that I appreciatea. The value of pure mathematics lies in the eternity of its beauty b. The significance of mathematics consists of generality and depths c. Curiosity, pride, and ambition are the incentives to research d. The work of mathematicians is to observe the mathematical reality e. Mathematics are more practical than physics, since the model of math is much closer to mathematical reality than that of physics to physical reality f. As physics goes toward idealism (quantum theory), math stands on the materialistic positiong. Math is more useful than many sciences, while utility places a restraint on the grandeur of mathematics h. Real mathematics is innocuous, while trivial mathematics (aerodynamics) is useful but dangerous i. Mathematics is a subject of youth j. Real mathematicians never regret pursuing a career of doing mathematics "
296,0521427061,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9888268-harish,4,"Published seven years before Hardy died, this achingly personal book offers an interesting case for pure mathematics among other things. "" A mathematician, on the other hand, is workingwith his own mathematical reality. Of this reality, as Iexplained in §22, I take a ‘realistic’ and not an ‘idealistic’view. At any rate (and this was my main point) thisrealistic view is much more plausible of mathematicalthan of physical reality, because mathematical objectsare so much more what they seem. A chair or a star isnot in the least like what it seems to be; the more wethink of it, the fuzzier its outlines become in the hazeof sensation which surrounds it; but ‘2’ or ‘317’ hasnothing to do with sensation, and its properties standout the more clearly the more closely we scrutinizeit.""

297,0521427061,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20167316-matthew,5,"“Indeed, there is more to be said, since there is one purpose at any rate which the real mathematics may serve in war. When the world is mad, a mathematician may find in mathematics an incomparable anodyne. For mathematics is, of all the arts and sciences, the most austere and the most remote, and a mathemati- cian should be of all men the one who can most easily take refuge where, as Bertrand Russell says, ‘one at least of our nobler impulses can best escape from the dreary exile of the actual world. It is a pity that it should be necessary to make one very serious reservation—he must not be too old. Mathematics is not a contemplative but a creative subject; no one can draw much consolation from it when he has lost the power or the desire to create; and that is apt to happen to a mathematician rather soon.“"
298,0521427061,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12797749-ashok-koduru,3,"This is a personal opinion. Like many people, I too was aware of Hardy only through the life of Ramanujan. I neither heard about him nor was I taught any significant contributions made by him. The essay by Hardy does raise some important questions although showing juxtaposed reasons like his loss of interest at one point and lack of significance in the problems he was dealing. The forward is a negative for the book which is almost half of it. While Hardy by his own admission said that Ramanujan was his greatest discovery in the field of Maths, I felt a little repelled while he was compared to people like Einstein and Bohr, giving reasons for us to read this book, which in itself is a big justification for lackluster achievements."
299,0521427061,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15718681-ilya-scheidwasser,2,"After seeing this essay talked up by David Foster Wallace in one of his essays in Both Flesh And Not, I was curious and decided to check it out. Disappointingly, though, I didn't get much out of it. The style wasn't particularly engaging, and the subject was somewhat dull, or at least dully approached (essentially, why mathematicians do mathematics, and to what extent it's a defensible trade). I agreed with part of the thesis, i.e. that 'real' math is generally something people do because they like it and are good at it, not so much because it's useful to society, but the essay also pushed various other ideas I don't really agree with... anyway, the problem wasn't the ideas themselves so much as how they were presented."
