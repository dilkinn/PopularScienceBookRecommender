You probably know, too, that the potato later became a staple in many European countries and that smallpox decimated the native population of the Americas. However, what you may not know is how profound was the impact on the course of history of the exchange of animals, plants, minerals, and microorganisms from the Old World to and from the New. Historians call this phenomenon the Columbian Exchange. Writing in 1493, Charles C. Mann refers to it as a turning-point equally as profound as the development of agriculture. One after another, this brilliant book brushes away a host of cherished myths that have grown up in the shadows of history. Consider:■ The Columbian Exchange was by no means limited to commerce between Europe and the Americas. It was a truly global phenomenon, with far-reaching effects in Asia and Africa as well. Mann refers to the era ushered in by the Columbian Exchange as the “Homogenocene” — a new phase in human history when globalization became a reality and the world we share became increasingly homogenized. ■ Though the Conquistadors’ search for gold was largely frustrated, their discovery of a mountain of silver in Bolivia led to Spain’s flooding the world with so much of this metal that it eventually wrecked the economies of both Europe and China.■ When Europeans sailed westward to colonize the New World, the native population was huge. For example, the Eastern seaboard of North America was more densely populated than Western Europe. Diseases inadvertently introduced from Europe and Africa reduced the population by half or more within the first few decades. ■ Most Americans think of the westward movement of people as a European phenomenon. It was, in fact, predominantly African. Africans, transported over the sea as slaves, outnumbered European colonists by huge ratios. Not until the 19th Century, when the Irish potato famine and political upheaval across Europe produced mass emigration to the Americas, did the ethnic balance tip. These are just a few of the eye-opening themes Charles Mann develops so ably in 1493. If you have even a passing interest in how the world got to be the way it is, read this book.(From www.malwarwickonbooks.com)"

Mann's follow up to his spectacular 1491 look at the pre-Columbian Americas is quite an admirable undertaking. Here he looks at the consequences of Columbus's voyages to the Americas. For better and/or for worse they had far reaching affects, especially biologically. Mann's premise seems to state that Columbus was not a morally good man, but he should be recognized as bringing about the world's biological homogenization. Though this is no murder mystery, I'm going to refrain from giving examples, because that would spoil the fun of reading 1493....hm...well, that doesn't give me much else to talk about."
2,0307265722,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3658457-tom-lichtenberg,5,"Human history no longer belongs to the twin poles of Eurocentricism, which either praise or damn European superiority or dominance, respectively. One consequence of recent globalization and multiculturalism is a redress of the balance of the human story, one which assigns both place and respect (and appropriate blame) to all of the civilizations of size in this world. It reminds us that not only Europeans engaged in the African slave trade, that not only Europeans conquered and settled and traded and stole. Certainly they did all this as well, and in large measure, but not exclusively. The book 1493, by Charles C Mann, is part of this trend and has many interesting stories to tell, centered around the global ecological consequences of Columbus' voyages to the Caribbean. These tales range from tracking the history of malaria and its attendant socio-political consequences (on slavery and war, among other things), to the suggestion that the mini Ice Age in Europe in the 17th century may have been due to the mass decimation of North American native peoples, which was primarily due to the introduction to the continent of infectious diseases such as smallpox. Apparently the native people engaged in widespread burning as an agricultural practice, and the cessation of this, along with the consequent overgrowth of trees, led to a reduction of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. In other words, wherever there have been large numbers of humans, they have impacted the environment, including the realm of climate change. That we are doing such now with the fossil fuel burn-off is undeniable, but it is also not unprecedented. It's a conceit of our time that we are the first to do everything. In fact, all of our actions and their unintended consequences are part of a sequence that has been ongoing since the time of the first large-scale human populations, such as in China, Egypt, Mexico, Peru, and elsewhere. Mann argues that the voyages of Columbus kicked off the process of globalization that we are merely continuing now and have been for more than five hundred years. It's a long and complex story, with lots of fascinating aspects, covering the entire planet, from Asia and Africa to Europe and the Americas. It is a truism that history is the story of the conquerors, but we are all now, in this time, survivors of the past, and merely by survival we are all the victors today. History is becoming more and more a story of us all, a vast and curious tapestry of societies all around the world that have far more in common than they ever had differences. It's about time we were all included."
3,0307265722,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3078990-ana-mardoll,2,"1493 / 978-0307265722I really enjoyed Charles Mann's 1491, but after struggling to get through 1493, I'm afraid to re-read the first and find that my opinion may now be reversed.1491 was for me a wonderfully compiled and comprehensive look at the Americas before Columbus arrived and everything was inexorably changed. I appreciated the information presented in the book, as well as the manner in which it was presented -- I was strongly affected by Mann's tone with that volume and how he seemed to take a great deal of care in writing his narrative respectfully as well as engagingly and accurately. We, the readers, may have been treading on the bones of history, but there was (for me) a sense that we were doing so with reverence. 1493, on the other hand, seems to suffer from the success of the first. We'll start with the title, which seems to imply that 1493 will be what 1491 was: a comprehensive look at the Americas in that pivotal year, only instead of taking a snapshot immediately before Columbus' arrival, we'll look at immediately after. Unfortunately, this isn't really the case; 1493 is about what Mann calls ""the Columbian Exchange"", by which he means the fact that people, animals, plants, insects, microorganisms, etc. were ferried all over the world by travelers (like, but not limited to, Columbus) into new ecosystems, where they wrought serious changes to the local ecology and economy.This isn't a bad thesis, and certainly there are a number of interesting facts here, but it means we're talking about a globe-spanning topic with millions of individual unique examples, without any single narrative to really tie things firmly and interestingly together. Perhaps the book would have worked better if it were limited to the Americas, as 1491 had been, and just looked at what the Europeans introduced into the American ecosystem -- and possibly a look at what the Europeans brought back from America with them. That would have been a more cohesive narrative, I think, than trying to tie the African slave trade in the 1700s in with a look at the effects of sweet potatoes on Communist China in the 1900s. Even if you're willing to stick with the narrative wherever it takes you -- and without being bored sometimes at the ratio of encyclopedic facts to engaging narrative -- there's additionally a huge tonal shift between this book and its predecessor, and for me at least this was a serious obstacle. 1491 had a very respectful tone, and was very self-aware of its own shortcomings. Mann open acknowledged that he was something of a dilettante historian, and that he was only stepping forward with his book in order to fill a literary gap that he felt needed filling. There were troubling untruths being told in service to the Columbus myth and he felt that the record needed to be set straight on certain issues.Yet here in 1493, it feels like Mann has shed his respectful demeanor and taken on a tone that seems terribly self-aggrandizing. Just to select from the first chapter alone, he spends a tremendous amount of time setting up a Golden Mean Fallacy: 'some people claim THIS, other people claim THAT, but the truth is here in the middle'. This isn't necessary, it detracts from the narrative, and it pads the book out to a tedious length for no reason that I can see other than so Mann can pat himself on the back for being Right while others are Wrong rather than just getting to the meat of the subject matter. Here is one quote where he handles different aspects of the Columbus myth: ""Unsurprisingly, native people rarely endorse this view of their history, and Colón's part in it. An army of activists and scholars has bombarded the public with condemnations of the man and his works. They have called him brutal (he was, by today's standards) and racist (he wasn't, strictly speaking--modern concepts of race had not yet been invented); incompetent as an administrator (he was) and as a seaman (he wasn't); a religious fanatic (he surely was, from a secular point of view); and a greedy monomaniac (a charge, the admiral's supporters would say, that could be leveled against all ambitious souls). Colón, his detractors charge, never understood what he had found.""I don't understand why Mann wants to bash on the people he sees as ideological opponents (an ""army of activists""? Really?), instead of just talking about Columbus from the ground up. He would have been better served to do so, really, because this kind of summing up of the opposition seems so lazy as to make me worry about the scholarship of the rest of the book. For instance, Columbus isn't called ""racist"" because his detractors mistakenly believe he subscribed to the same understanding of race as we do today; they call him ""racist"" because he didn't have a problem with enslaving and casually genociding people who weren't sufficiently like himself to deserve his empathy. They are, in other words, applying the term to his actions rather than to his supposed train of logic in service to those actions. For Mann to pretend otherwise troubles me: either he really doesn't understand Columbus' detractors, or he does understand and he's deliberately misrepresenting them. I find that a matter for concern. Later, in the same chapter, Mann will casually dismiss local disapproval with the Columbus monument in Santo Domingo as nothing more than misplaced anger at dictator Rafael Trujillo, and will go so far as to lecture the residents on what they should consider the 'true' meaning of the Columbus monument: ""Residents of the walled-off slums around the monument told reporters that they thought Colón deserved no commemoration at all. A thesis of this book is that their belief, no matter how understandable, is mistaken. The Columbian Exchange had such far-reaching effects that some biologists now say that Colón's voyages marked the beginning of a new biological era: the Homogenocene. The term refers to homogenizing: mixing unlike substances to create a uniform blend. With the Columbian Exchange, places that were once ecologically distinct have become more alike. In this sense the world has become one, exactly as the old admiral hoped. The lighthouse in Santo Domingo should be regarded less as a celebration of the man who began it than a recognition of the world he almost accidentally created, the world of the Homogenocene we live in today.""So, just to be clear, Dominicans who regard the local monument to Columbus as a reprehensible commemoration to Columbus are wrong because they ""should"" view the monument as recognition of the fact that some people -- including, but not limited to, Columbus -- piloted a lot of different ships to a lot of different places over a lot of different time periods, and some of the results of those events are things like sweet potatoes and their effect on Communist China. Clearly. I wanted -- so much! -- to like 1493. I expected to like it so much that even after receiving a free copy through Vine, I purchased an e-book version as well so that I could have both. I did this because I liked the scope, the cohesion, and the tone of 1491 immensely. But the scope of 1493 is so vast as to be almost infinite, the narrative cohesion is non-existent in places and is often abandoned in favor of lists of facts, and the tone seems to indicate that the author thinks he understands history better than anyone else, in the wake of one extremely popular and successful book. Because of that, I personally did not find 1493 to be entertaining, enlightening, or respectful of the subject matter, and I really cannot recommend it.

4,0307265722,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3222446-libby,5,"Remember Fourth Grade? Sister Mary Anne taught us to singsong ""Columbus sailed the ocean blue in fourteen hundred and ninety two."" Then we skipped to Jamestown in 1607. Did you ever get the feeling that we had missed a lot of something somewhere? Well, boys and girls, we surely did! Charles C. Mann has given us a marvelous account of the events that occurred that directly relate to what he calls the Columbian exchange. Now most of us have a vague idea that the invasive European powers brought some unwelcome gifts like influenza and small pox. Most of us have a faint awareness that foods like the potato and tomato crossed to Europe from the Americas. Almost everyone knows that the Spaniards looted for gold and silver. But the things we don't always know may have caused more world shaking events. It was not simply gold doubloons that powered the rise of Western Europe. Trade in items like pineapple, sweet potatoes, blue and white Ming porcelain, ladies' fans of silk and lace, and people, enslaved and free, but mostly in some form of servitude. Mann recounts stories of the deadly silver mines of Potosi, the Manila Galleons, the trade in sugarcane, natural rubber and mosquitoes. He recounts his stories with clarity and wit. This book is easy to read and easy to love. It's full of really neat stuff!"
5,0307265722,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5672623-nancy,3,"1493: Uncovering the New World Columbus Created explores what happened when the New World and Old World came into contact from an ecological, biological, and economic perspective. The result is history not as made by kings and queens and generals, but by the potato, tobacco, the spice trade, and infectious disease. Take this, for instance: West Africans have an inherited immunity to malaria, the disease that beset early colonists and their indentured servants and then the native people of the Americas they originally enslaved to work the malarial-ridden fields of sugarcane, tobacco, and rice. So can we trace the institution of slavery in this country to a disease? Mann argues persuasively that there is a connection, though he is quick to point out that it would be simplistic to say that malaria caused slavery, and is just as quick to say that slavery would have existed in the Americas without it. And, of course, people being what they are unfortunately, greed and callousness are factors too, another point Mann makes. Phew. It's fascinating stuff, but it becomes something of a chore to get through, I'm sorry to say, especially because I thought his book 1491 (about the pre-contact Americas) was not only brilliant but very readable. "
6,0307265722,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4858143-chungsoo-j-lee,5,"The subtitle is noteworthy: ""Uncovering the New World Columbus Created,"" not ""Discovered."" In arriving at the New World, Charles C. Mann proposes, Columbus created a new world of globalization and modernization. The author carries the readers through a breathtaking geological scope and time span stretching from Spain, England, Americans (north and south), Africa, China, and Philippines and from the 15th through 21st centuries in a truly global and cosmic scale, providing an account of trade, diseases, ecological booms and busts, piracy, slavery, wars, and many more topics. This is not a history of the past but a compelling genealogical account of how the present came about. I now understand the present Americans, Philippines, and China better than ever, thanks to this book. This book tells the history told not by the winners but by the victims of the inevitable ""Columbus exchange"" that changed everyone's life forever all around both in individual and societal scare and both the victims and the perpetrators alike who are affected by the ""Columbus exchange."" Like a careful archeologist and a genealogist, Mann uncovers the hidden, repressed, ignored, or otherwised forgotten facts which account for the genealogy of the present in the Nietzschean sense. Betweens the lines in many pages of the book one can hear the cries of the victims who fell at the hands of harsh enslavement in the American plantations, the Andes mountains, and the Amazonian rain forests and river basin along with the silent weeping of the earth from the soils of China, Philippines, and elsewhere. The utter devastation and destruction of the Indian races by diseases and human cruelty cannot be ignored. This is a compelling and well written book (equally well narrated by Robertson Dean) with a remarkable thesis: That Columbus ushered in the global age with all of its ecological, political, and economical consequences still impacting the present global world. The link Columbus established unknowingly around the world is called ""the Columbus exchange"" whereby not only goods and cultures were exchanged by trade and exploit but also micro organisms, plants, diseases, and host of other species that were exchanged wittingly or unwittingly not only between Americas and Europe but also with China and Philippines, Brazile, and Central America. The Columbus exchange was an exchange of global magnitude that tied the world into one destiny, one corner of the earth affecting the other, for good or ill. The result of the global exchange is called ""homogenescene"" (sp?) - making and mixing diverse species so as to shape the world into an homogeneous and essentially one ecologically and culturally familiar place. To be sure, Columbus never saw China, his ultimate destination. But his dream of establishing the lucrative trade route to China (for silk and spices) was realized less than 100 years later, in 1565, when Miguel López de Legazpi, the first royal governor, arrived in Cebu from New Spain (Mexico), who shared the same vision and goal as Columbus, and met the Chinese merchants for the first time. Thus, the global galleon trade began in earnest. At the bottom of Columbus's ambition was to bring the riches of China to Spain in order, in turn, to fund the Franciscan goal of rescuing Jerusalem from the Muslims. Of course, the purported reason was to evangelize China. (Columbus resided in the Franciscan monastery and later years believed that he was the only qualified person to convert the Chinese emperor to Christianity.) Columbus was eventually sponsored by the Spanish monarch who lusted after the China's wealth, then the world's richest country. For better or for worse, the consequences of the Columbus exchange, foreseen and unforeseen, were of biblical proportion: the indigenous Indian races first in the now-a-day Puerto Rico and soon thereafter the rest of the Americas were almost completely wipe out by malaria, small pox, hepatitis, and yellow fever; the introduction of corn and sweet potatoes to China deforested the country, causing unprecedented flood and famine, while also making China the world's most populous nation. The Ming Dynasty coveted the silver shipped from the New Spain (Mexico) in order to fund its currency. But millions of Incas died while mining and refining silver from the mountains of Inca (Peru and other places), as poisoned by mercury while being forced to labor in the Peruvian mountains. Spain's wealth based on silver and her rise to world power was obtained at the cost of millions of Inca Indians' lives that perished at the silver mines and refineries. The European luxuries and booms in burgeoning cities like Seville, London, and Paris were brought by the sacrifice of the Indians. Riding in the galleon trade was also the American tobacco, first smoked by the native Indians. Tobacco quickly addicted Londoners, Chinese, as well as the Japanese emperor and countless others around the globe, including the priests who smoked it during the mass in the cathedrals of Europe. All corners of the world were at once hooked in nicotine-a true globalization brought on by the Columbus exchange. The list of the Columbus exchange brought on with global implications for good or ill goes on and on. But the underlying thesis of the book is that these ecological changes were revolutionary not only biologically but also economically, socially, and politically, giving the ultimate rise to the Western dominance in the modern age--the dominance obtained at the cost of devastation of the Indians and by the African slave labor. The malaria was transported from London but once it landed in the tropical climate of James Town, it took off like a wild fire, decimating both the American indians and the new comers alike. The death toll of the new comers to the disease was staggering; but its impact on the Indians were greater. It was malaria that could explain the passivity of the Indians who did not wipe out the white invaders despite many opportunities to do so. It was malaria that even explains in an important way the defeat of the British forces later, giving rise to American Independence. It was malaria too which made African slaves more viable as slaves economically in America, as the Indian slaves (first used by the tobacco farmers) grew feeble and smaller in numbers in the face of malaria. African slaves were genetically superior to the European slave masters to resist malaria; but the superiority worked against them, as it make them more attractive as slave laborers. As Mann puts it, the slave ships from Africa were riding on the winds of malaria, providing much needed labor force for harvesting the tobacco in James Town, Virginia, North Carolina, and elsewhere. Yes, James Town, the first American settlement, was founded on the tobacco leaves to meet the demands of the nicotine addiction in Europe. It must also be noted that James Town gave birth to the first representative democracy as well as the first institution of slavery. The first slave was purchased there only 4 days after establishing the first representative governing council. If James Town in Virginia fed the nicotine crave in London and elsewhere in Europe, the eastern most Caribbean island, Barbados, first supplied the sugar craze in Europe--the taste of which was first discovered when the Crusaders invaded the Middle East. There again in Barbados, the African slaves proved to be superior in resisting the malaria, who also in turn brought with them the yellow fever from Africa which in turn devastated the Dutch traders and slave masters, while not affecting the Africans themselves who were immune from the disease. Nonetheless, the lucrative sugar industry could not be deterred by the onslaught of diseases. The labor force had to be provided at all cost, which in turn ushered in a full blown slavery industry, the like of which was never seen in the entire history of slavery from ancient time to the present from Rome to Africa. Adam Smith opposed slavery, arguing that it did not make economic sense (i.e., slaves did not speak the language, did not know how to farm European way, would rebel or run away, as they did). But with the help of malaria and yellow fever cradled in the ideal Caribbean/Mid-Atlantic tropical conditions (like James Town), these diseases made slavery of Africans viable and superior alternative to the indentured servants from Europe or to the native Indian slaves (who could not be put to slavery if they were baptized as Christians). Again, Africans' physical superiority contributed to their enslavement to their detriment. However, more than half escaped and intermarried with Indians and founded the modern nations such as Nicaragua and Haiti. There were more Africans and Indians than Europeans until the massive European immigrations in the 19th century; as every European brought two or three African slaves to America. Potatoes transported to Europe gave population boom, which stabilized the governments of England, Dutch, Spain, and Portugal, who in turn were able to focus outward and expand toward the world in their respective imperialistic ambitions and dominance. Nothing else but potatoes were largely responsible for their rise, says the author. With the rise also came the downfall, however, as potatoes were grown in mass, uni-crop farming--specially in Ireland--which in turn were wiped out by the pestilent that attacked potatoes exclusively and efficiently, causing the infamous Irish famine, which in turn created the influx of Irish immigrants to the US in the mid 19th century. Another example of the global impact of the Columbus exchange.African slaves were not docile laborers. They rebelled and joined with the native Indians and successfully fought against the slave masters. The run-away slaves, not the Spaniards, were the first ever to see the Pacific Ocean from the ridges of high mountains in Panama. They ran many successful ambushes and gorilla attacks against the plantations from which they escaped, so much that they gave the Spanish government enormous problems. The maroons (the Spanish word for renegades) joined forces with the native indians but also with English pirates (include the famous pirate Drake) to attack Spanish shipments of silver and other goods. Many maroons were absorbed by the Indian communities (which in turn were formed in the deep forests unreachable by the Europeans) and married Indian women, thus creating the present day latin American nations such as Mexico, Nicaragua, and Brazil. (They had no choice but to marry Indians, as only one third of the African slaves brought to America were women; and marrying to a Christianized Indian woman meant legal protection (though only good on paper) from enslavement.) Haiti was the first nation of maroons to form an independent nation, which shocked the slave trading nations of Europe. Thousands of Napoleon troops, to came to squish the rebellion, fell to the yellow fever, which in turn caused France to give up Haiti in the end. Defeat at the Haiti also largely contributed to selling off at a bargain the large chunk of America in the Louisiana Purchase. American diseases then were largely responsible for bringing about American Independence and the Louisiana Purchase! The maroons forms many parts of the present Mexico. The maroons called Quilombolas in Amazon jungles were only recently acknowledged formally by Brazilian government. It appears that they have finally gained freedom but they are facing the industrial globalization that threatens their livelihood through deforestation for timber. The struggles of the maroons continues. It must be underscored once again: That from silver extracted through devastation of Indian land and forced slavery arose the Spanish world power; and that from the equally devastating African slavery that cultivated tobacco and sugar came the Western commerce and imperialism. Also It is also from the forced Indian labor in South America the rubber was extracted and brought to England to fuel the industrial revolution, as rubber was one of the three essential elements of the Industrial Revolution along with steel and fossil fuel. The atrocities committed to the Amazonian indians by the rubber industry--even to the present day--not to mention the environmental disasters, must be underscored. Thanks to the Columbus exchange, the rubber production became truly global, as Indonesia and southern China are nowadays aggressively cultivating the foreign trees, driving away the forests and the animals. In short, there was (and still is) enormous human cost to the rise of western imperialism and wealth. The wealth of London, Paris, Madrid, and other European cities sailed on the blood of the American Indians and African slaves. The Western rise and dominance had nothing to do with free trade, the efficiency of capitalism, or the Western technology and ingenuity. Until Columbus landed in America, the Incas and China had the most advanced civilizations known to the world at the time. (Charles Mann's previous book, 1491, offers the most up-to-date account of the perished but once dynamic and thriving Indian civilizations that once dominated in the American landscape.) The present demographic dominance of Caucasians in North America will be short lived; and the world will become increasingly ""homogenescene."" And the affects of the Columbus exchange will continue for better or for worse. Wealth accumulated off the back of the poor gamblers, as seen in the skylines of Las Vegas, and a society promoting such accumulation of wealth (such as in the US) cannot be sustained economically and morally.  But such phenomenon is not only a deviation and anomaly of capitalism (an honest result of a free market economy, as some would say!) but, I submit in light of reading this book, a global phenomenon inaugurated by the ""Columbus exchange,"" the exchange which made such usurpation possible in a global scale.  Structurally, there is no difference between the way in which the wealth of Las Vegas was obtained (from the back of the poor) from how the wealth of the colonial imperialism of the West was won (off the back of the wretched Indians and African slaves), thanks to the Columbus exchange.  Wealth by usurpation of the poor and the weak must be the overarching theme of world history from ancient times to modern or post modern capitalism. The Columbus exchange locked the world globally forever in this inextricable chain of economic and political injustice. "
7,0307265722,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,5,"This fascinating, authoritative book describes the ""Columbian Exchange"" after Columbus' ""discovery"" of the Americas. The book describes the exchange of people, products, plants, animals, and micro-organisms between the Americas and the rest of the world. Much of the book discusses the growth and trade of tobacco, potatoes, tomatoes, corn, silver, sugar, slaves, mosquitoes, smallpox, guano and rubber. Charles Mann emphasizes the unintended consequences of this trade. The book is peppered with interesting facts. In England, for example, it was much more lucrative for rich people to hire indentured servants than to buy slaves. However, until the 19th century, twice as many slaves were brought to the Americas as Europeans, largely due to the fact that Africans were less susceptible to malaria! Jamestown was the American settlement where African slaves were first bought. Jamestown was a project of a private investment company; huge amounts of capital and large numbers of English people went there. Most of the people perished, due to arrogance and incompetence. Spanish conquistadors displayed amazing inhumanity to the populations they encountered in the Americas--not just by modern standards, but even by the standards of their time. Even the Spanish rulers recognized the inhumanity, and tried unsuccessfully to rein in the Spanish atrocities. Mexico City was the first truly international metropolis, inhabited by people from all the continents.The Chinese economy during this time period was a mess. Incoming rulers would periodically invalidate the currency, and replace it with new currency, thus bankrupting the nation with impunity, all for the sake of personal vanity. Silver from Bolivia helped to temporarily stabilize the economy, before wrecking it again.Many other reviewers have compared 1493 to Charles Mann's earlier book 1491, which details the Americas before Columbus. However, one should not view 1493 as simply a continuation of 1491, as 1493 is just as much about the ""old world"" as it is about the new. One can view 1493 as being primarily about unintended consequences, both good and bad, for the new world as well as for the old world. "

Worms and parasites, slaves and masters, greed and commerce, tobacco and guano – all have radically shaped today's world, and continue to do so. The Columbian Exchange united, both for better and for worse, this earth in ways that Columbus could never have dreamed.The author's writing is well organized, researched, illustrated, and annotated. Given that, it still could have been boring but it wasn't. Charles Mann kept me entertained and interested through every word, remarkable considering how much information he was able to impart in the roughly 400 pages of text. I knew bits and pieces of this story, but never the bigger picture as he was able to show me. He did this without becoming pedantic, condescending, or proselytizing. I highly recommend this book to anyone at all interested in the history and future of this planet.I received a free uncorrected proof of this book for purposes of review."

1493,
 by Charles Mann, is one of them. His earlier best-selling 
1491
 probably is as well, but I haven’t gotten around to that yet.Briefly, 1493 examines how the world changed due to, and very soon after, the initial contact between the Americas and the rest of the world in 1492. The term “Columbian Exchange” reminds us that the change was bidirectional. We are all familiar with the devastation the Old World’s diseases caused in the Americas, but there is so, so much more. Mann starts in his New England garden, pointing out that nothing in it originated within 1000 miles. Near the end, he points out that the same is true of the gardens in the Philippines, despite their cherished evocations of homely tradition.The role China plays in the book will probably startle many. Even more dramatic is how far the interaction and mixing of the “Red” and “Black” got, long before “White” Europeans arrived in sufficient numbers to become culturally dominant. Long before the Pilgrims even got to New England, there were entire cities composed of those resisting European subjugation. The scope of the Columbian Exchange is staggering. It affected the collapse of Chinese empires and the timing of the Protestant Reformation, neither of which are explored, as far as I remember, in college history classes, much less in grade school.Most of the United States was settled later, and by different cultural forces, and so I wonder if those south of the Rio Grande (or perhaps in the eastern subtropical portion of the United States) would find this even more revelatory.If you want more arguments on why you might want to read this big, fat book, check out any or all of these reviews:• New York Times,

, which dissects the United States into largely discrete and somewhat divergent regions, based on their culture of their “effective” founders. Woodard’s book has more flaws than Mann’s — the author’s personal allegiance to New England gets in the way of an unbiased analysis — but is in many ways a more important book, at least to North Americans, with a significant bearing on the caustic partisan contemporary environment in the United States. Mann’s book highlights a few of the biases implicit in Woodard’s telling, but the real goal of the pair is to force the reader to reexamine old beliefs about the history of the Americas."

The interconnectedness of the world is elucidated in Mann's dizzying excursions to the European colonies in the Americas and Caribbean, Africa, and China. The roots of globalization are to be found in the so-called ""Columbian Exchange"", the transfer of peoples, plants, domesticated animals, agricultural practices, and diseases between continents. Mann has a fresh perspective on the blending of peoples and cultures. His coverage of the enslavement of black Africans and subjugation and slaughter of Native Americans by the colonials goes beyond the portrayal of these peoples as passive victims without ""agency"". He highlights how Indians fought back successfully many times before successful colonies were established, and diseases such as smallpox and influenza and the colonist's exploitation of intertribal competition often sealed their fate. Africans accompanied Europeans from the earliest expeditions, and in most colonies they outnumbered them. Examples from Santo Domingo, Brazil, Panama, and Florida highlight how from the beginning escape and establishment of guerilla bases with renegade Indians sowed the seeds of their eventual independence. The key role of malaria and yellow fever in the growth of black slavery is a major source of speculative exploration by Mann. The delusion of early explorers to America that China could be readily reached was a pervasive theme that in some senses was soon realized. Mann balances the story and impact of the transfer of tobacco, corn, and potatoes from the Americas to Europe and Asia with that of the introduction of wheat, sugar, coffee, and domestic animals to the colonies. The new agricultural bounty is associated with population explosions in Europe and China, but at the same time the changes are linked to famines and floods wrought by transferred pests and negative ecological consequences of deforestation and the dependence of industrial agriculture on a few vulnerable crops. The boom-and-bust history of rubber is nicely told, as is the economic bonanza of guano as the first industrial fertilizer. Overall, this lengthy, but readable, book is a great accomplishment as a synthesis of trends that make the modern world what it is today."
12,0307265722,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3144945-alex,5,"Maybe not quite as good as 1491? But probably just because I was more interested in the subject matter there. Once again, Mann has written a kickass book. I really dig this guy."
13,0307265722,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2207574-andres,5,"In 1491 Mann explored the newest findings about what the Americas were actually like before the ""Old World"" set foot on it (as opposed to the dated perceptions that we can't seem to easily shake loose). Now Mann explores how the world reacted, and was affected, by this meeting.I can't even begin to summarize what information is covered here, but here is a list of things that are discussed: potatoes, tomatoes, tobacco, sugar, rubber, gum, rum, Madeira, mosquitoes, malaria, yellow fever, smallpox, silver, guano, Africans, Indians, the Chinese, Spaniards, Basque miners, slavery, pirates, and a lot more. We may know a little about each of these subjects but here their connections are explained and, even better, the consequences and results of those connections are fully explored. To say this is exceptionally interesting would be an understatement. A lot of the information presented here is new to me, or at least new in the sense that what I learned as separate histories is shown here to have connections that were never explicitly pointed out (and I never would have guessed at). (Case in point, everyone is taught that the Spanish mined South America for its silver, but who ever pointed out that half of that silver ended up in China? And the reasons why it ended up there? And the impact it had there? Etc.) The author does reference this book, but I'm pretty sure he expands on the original idea rather than simply rehashing it(and if I ever read that book, I'll insert an update about that here).I consider this a far more historically dense book than 1491 since the cultural and biological exchanges between the Old and New Worlds, as can be guessed, was (and continues to be) very complicated. This is just as much a worthy sequel to 1491 as 1491 is a worthy 'prequel' to this book."
14,0307265722,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8079403-max,4,"Mann documents the Columbian Exchange, the beginning of globalization. Fifteenth century Europe, desirous of Chinese silk and porcelain, was blocked to the east by hostile Muslim countries. Columbus embarked to find a western route. Within 100 years global trade with China and the Americas was underway and the Columbian Exchange was firmly established. Silver mined in Bolivia by slaves brought in from Africa was shipped to China for silk and porcelain shipped to Spain via Mexico and Panama. Another example is the shipment of Virginia tobacco and Caribbean sugar to every corner of the globe in return for finished goods, farm animals and slaves.Riding along with the silk, porcelain, tobacco leaf, sugar, silver, farm animals and slaves were wild animals, plants and microbes dramatically changing the ecosystems of their new homes where they often faced no natural enemies. The native population of Hispaniola, where Columbus established his first permanent settlement, was decimated by disease as invasive insects and pathogens ran amok. Likewise native populations of North America were reduced to a fraction of their original numbers. Mann speculates that this depopulation led to the little ice age in the sixteenth century. The Indians had been clearing extensive areas through burning. With far fewer Indians the North American forests regenerated. As the forests grew back they sucked carbon dioxide out of the air. Global cooling was the result. The Columbian Exchange transformed cultures. For example North American Plains Indians became nomads as they mastered Spanish horses creating the image we have today of the Apache and Comanche. Lifestyles of people around the world were radically altered. New food plants spread everywhere and people half a world apart began farming the same genetically similar crops which were vulnerable to the same pests and diseases. Diversity declined. This post 1492 world Mann calls the Homogenocine. Mann selectively explores consequences of the Columbian Exchange. He ties everything from famine in Ireland to the fall of the Ming dynasty to the Exchange. The settlements in Hispaniola and Jamestown, the spread of malaria and yellow fever, the development of tobacco and sugar farming in the new world, and even a brief history of the Ming dynasty’s wars with pirates get special coverage. Changes in China were dramatic. Diets for many Chinese shifted from rice and beans to sweet potatoes and corn which grew where traditional crops would not. This led to rapid population growth, over farming, deforestation, flooding and civil unrest. Reliance on the silver trade, a key component of the Columbian exchange furthered political instability hastening the demise of the Ming dynasty in 1644. Using silver as the official medium of exchange meant control of the money supply was impossible. Much of China’s wealth was squandered purchasing silver.Europe also was destabilized by the Columbian Exchange. Potatoes became a staple crop extending the Malthusian trap which finally caught up with Ireland in the 1840’s with dire consequences. The potato fueled rapid population growth becoming the only solid food 40% of Irishmen consumed. When another Columbian exchange import, the potato blight, hit the genetically similar potatoes, they all quickly succumbed. The ensuing famine led to mass migration changing the course of US history as well as Ireland’s. Mann also traces the guano trade from South America which initiated large scale fertilizer use greatly increasing European crop yields and population. He even shows how the Colorado potato beetle led to the development of pesticides, first arsenic then DDT. Mann explores the exploitation of the Amazon and its residents beginning with tapping rubber trees in the forest which eventually gave way to the development of the rubber plantation industry. Henry Ford established a huge plantation in the Amazon, which after a bad start was finished off by the South American leaf blight. India and Indonesia established plantations that got off to better starts but they too got hit by the leaf blight. They had selected high yielding trees that turned out to have little resistance. Recently China has deforested huge areas of its own land for rubber plantations. China is expanding its rubber plantation operations to Laos and Thailand where it exploits locals with one sided contracts. These new plantations are already sucking the water out of the native forest forcing people out of their traditional way of life. In the end the South American leaf blight will find its way there. The story just goes on as short term profit trumps all.The Columbian Exchange included people as well as plants, animals and microbes creating the first global urban center, Mexico City. It mixed together Europeans, Africans, Asians, and of course Native Americans. Intermarriage between the different races was widespread. The Spanish established elaborate categories to try to distinguish those of mixed heritage based on the particular mix. Mestizo (Indo European), mulatto (Afro European) and zambo (Afro Indian) were just the beginning. When these groups mixed with each other, the Spanish even had labels for the further mixed offspring. For example, the child of a Spaniard and a mestizo was a called a castizo. It wasn’t long before those with a single heritage were few and far between. Something often not fully appreciated is that more Africans than Europeans initially came to the Americas even though it wasn’t their choice. Slavery was driven by the tobacco farms in the US and even more significantly the huge Caribbean and South American sugar plantations and mining operations. Many slaves escaped throughout the Americas and mixed with exploited Indian tribes. Mann contends that very likely escaped African slaves saw the Pacific from Panama before Balboa. The Indians and former slaves formed new communities and developed new cultures throughout the Americas. One example was Palmares in Brazil which defied constant Portuguese attacks for 90 years in the seventeenth century before succumbing. In other cases these new groups would overwhelm their European exploiters as in the 1804 revolution in Haiti. The slaves were typically prisoners of war captured in fighting between African tribes who sold them to Europeans. They were fighting men who would escape and seek retribution against their exploiters. They intermarried with Native Americans creating formidable new groups with their combined skill sets. The Columbian Exchange changed the concept of slavery. Prior to 1493, slave-owners typically had contact with their slaves. Africans practiced slavery as well as Europeans and there were established roles for owner and slave. The slave was a human in the lowest category, but still a person like everyone else. Slavery was not considered wrong and did not have to be justified by labelling the slave sub-human. Race was not a concept, as we know it, back then. For Europeans any heathen could be made a slave. Christians could not. Thus Jews, heretics, Indians, Muslims and most Africans were all equal candidates for slavery. The Columbian Exchange changed the practice of slavery. As large plantations were built in the New World with their owners living in Europe the traditional relationship between slave and owner was broken. This was particularly true in the sugar plantations and mines. Slaves were managed by taskmasters who treated slaves like cattle in their drive to meet profit expectations and quotas set by owners far away who didn’t have to see the human consequences. The slave trade in Africa developed to supply the huge numbers needed. African slaves were particularly valuable because they were more resistant to malaria and yellow fever that was ravaging the New World. Mann’s history is wide ranging, a potpourri of the fallout from Columbus’ discovery of the New World. It is a fascinating read although not tightly crafted and not as well done in my opinion as his earlier 1491. Still he makes his case. Today as we struggle with the effects of 21st century globalization, it is worthwhile to look back at how it all started."
15,0307265722,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6048268-nick-wisseman,5,"“Columbus’s voyage did not mark the discovery of a new world, but its creation.” So claims Charles Mann in his impressive 1493: Uncovering the New World Columbus Created. After reading the book, I can’t help but agree.Mann builds on the work of scholars like Alfred Crosby, who posited that “[a]fter Columbus, ecosystems that had been separate for eons suddenly met and mixed in a process” he called “the Columbian Exchange.” While being “neither fully controlled nor understood by its participants,” the exchange “took corn (maize) to Africa and sweet potatoes to East Asia, horses and apples to the Americas, and rhubarb and eucalyptus to Europe—and also swapped about a host of less-familiar organisms like insects, grasses, bacteria, and viruses.” It also moved people all around the globe.Sound like something you’ve heard before? The core argument may not be new, but the examples Mann uses to bolster his take on it are fascinating. For instance, when revisiting the effects of European diseases on Native Americans (which he examined at length in 1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus), Mann makes the case that the Columbian Exchange may have temporarily helped cause “today’s climate change in reverse.” Specifically, the Little Ice Age of 1550-1750 (or so), which brought hard winters, late springs, and bad harvests to the Northern Hemisphere, might have been a secondary consequence of the mass death of Native Americans: prior to Europeans’ arrival, Native Americans used fire to shape their surroundings, regularly burning forests on such a scale that for “weeks on end, smoke from Indian bonfires shrouded Florida, California, and the Great Plains.” But after smallpox and other plagues took their devastating toll, the fires diminished, resulting in less CO2 in the atmosphere, more trees to reduce the CO2 that remained, and a colder climate.Then there’s the role malaria (and to a lesser degree, yellow fever) likely played in the rise of the Atlantic slave trade. This other “Old World” disease was no friendlier to Native Americans, but it flourished in the warmer areas of the Americas so virulently that European colonists died there in droves. But Africans’ inherited and acquired resistances to the illness meant that, “biologically speaking, they were fitter, which is another way of saying that in these places they were—loaded words!—genetically superior.” Sadly, Africans’ immunity “became a wellspring for their enslavement,” since for (unscrupulous) Europeans “the economic logic was hard to ignore. If they wanted to grow tobacco, rice, or sugar, they were better off using African slaves than European indentured servants or Indian slaves.” Not coincidentally, the “Mason-Dixon line roughly split the East Coast into two zones, one in which falciparum malaria was an endemic threat, and one in which it was not.”And that’s just for starters: 1493 goes on to delve into the Galleon Trade and chart how Spanish silver from the brutal mining town of Potosí, Bolivia knit the world together like never before, financing wars in Europe and fueling a debilitating currency crisis in China, long the world’s largest economy. Next, Mann tracks the impact of crop migrations (like the introduction of Andean potatoes into Europe), the birth of the “agro-industrial complex,” the race for Amazonian rubber, and finally the “extraordinary cultural mix that slavery inadvertently promoted.”Mann’s writing is excellent, and the book is stuffed with devastating details, such as the tidbit that, when officials at the Peruvian mine of Huancavelica dug up the graves of their conscripted Native American workers in 1605, they found that the miners’ corpses left behind puddles of inhaled mercury. But while Mann claims in his prologue that “globalization brought both enormous economic gains and ecological and social tumult that threatened to offset those gains,” and later that “the huge benefits of moving species outweigh the huge harms,” his emphasis is decidedly on the negative aspects. In short, 1493 isn’t—and doesn’t pretend to be—a comprehensive account of the roots of the modern world.It’s just a damn good one.(For more reviews like this one, see www.nickwisseman.com)"
16,0307265722,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14247078-maitrey,5,"This was great engaging writing from an author I really admire. 1493 gives a fantastic overview of the kind of changes the globe has seen after Columbus landed in the New World and started what would be called the Columbian Exchange.Boy can Mann can weave a narrative, like how his grandfather's decision to buy a Philippine mahogany dining table might have led to ecological catastrophe by introducing invasive earthworms into the Philippines that destroyed the rice field terraces. Or how Potosi in 16th Century Bolivia was probably the first boom town in the wild west. Maybe you wanted to learn about Ford's madcap rubber town in the middle of nowhere Amazonia. Every one of these tales deals with extraordinary humans, and how effects such as globalization and disease, slavery and colonialism, played a much a larger role in actually shaping all our lives. This is an extraordinary book. Read it."
17,0307265722,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1500718-ryan,4,"Charles C. Mann's 1493: Uncovering the New World Columbus Created interprets contact as creating a new period in history, the Homogenocene. Combining ecology, epidemiology, economics, and geographic history, Mann shows what people did and what they suffered after encountering people, plants, and pests from other continents.The Columbian Exchange offered many benefits, such as increasing trade to allow silver into currency strapped China and silk into Europe. But it also offered catastrophes, such as transmitting diseases that decimated the indigenous populations in the Americas. For every potato that arrives in Ireland to nourish the downtrodden peasants, there is a blight that creates a famine.I often test a work of history by its ability to remind me that the past is stranger than I realize, and Mann passes the test in 1493. I'd never heard of Casta paintings before, which offer visual taxonomies of breeding between populations (e.g. if a Spaniard and a black person have a child, what should it be classified as? See the answer in a Casta painting...). At another point, Mann argues that European settlers in the American South relied on slave labor in part because Africans and their descendants were more likely to have a gene that protected them against malaria. Otherwise, the white settlers were dying too quickly of disease to do the work.In Better Angels of Our Nature Steven Pinker argues that international trade incentivizes peace, but Mann's presentation of the Columbian Exchange is typically a mixed bag of unintended consequences, coincidental benefits, and unexpected catastrophes. In addition to his ability to dig out strange details, Mann has an admirable knack for admitting when theories are controversial and further of citing very specifically the historians whose analysis he relies on. Although I learned a lot from 1493, it rarely inspired in me a desire to visit the past.Notes. (view spoiler)[The destruction of the Taino plunged Santo Domingo into poverty. The colonists had wiped out their own labor force. Spanish cruelty played its part in the calamity, but its larger cause was the Columbian Exchange. Before Colón none of the epidemic diseases common in Europe and Asia existed in the Americas. The viruses that cause smallpox, influenza, hepatitis, measles, encephalitis, and viral pneumonia; the bacteria that cause tuberculosis, diphtheria, cholera, typhus, scarlet fever, and bacterial meningitis—by a quirk of evolutionary history, all were unknown in the Western Hemisphere. Pg. 11.Except for defensive palisades, Powhatan farmers had no fences around their fields. Why screen off land if no cattle or sheep had to be kept inside? The English, by contrast, regarded well-tended fences as hallmarks of civilization. Pg. 47.Barely three weeks later a Dutch pirate ship landed at Jamestown. In its hold was “20. and odd Negroes”—slaves taken by the pirates from a Portuguese slave ship destined for Mexico. (About thirty more showed up in another ship a few days later.) In their hurry to extract tobacco profits, the tassantassas had been clamouring for more workers. The Africans had arrived at harvest time. Without a second thought colonists bought the Africans in exchange for the food the pirates needed for the return trip to Europe. Legally speaking, the “20. and odd” Africans may not have been slaves—their status is unclear. Nevertheless, they were not volunteers; their purchase was a landmark in the road to slavery. Within weeks of each other, Jamestown had inaugurated two of the future United States’ most long-lasting institutions: representative democracy and chattel slavery. Pg. 67.[Adam] Smith, who hated slavery, was trying to prove that something he detested was not only immoral, but foolish economically. Slavery, in his view, was largely the irrational product of humankind’s “love to domineer.” But he also believed that people try to find ways around economics problems that stand in the way of their desires. Just as one would expect, slave owners throughout history have created incentives for their slaves to work efficiently: paths to liberty. Work hard and true, masters in effect said, and you will eventually be allowed to walk away. Often, too, slaves were assigned tasks that brought some satisfaction, as in the case of African or Roman armies made up of captive soldiers—the slaves had switched sides, so to speak, but their lives were unchanged in many ways, and there was always the prospect of earning glory.Slavery in the Americas, though, was something else: a lifelong sentence, in most cases, to awful work in brutal conditions without hope of winning freedom. 90-1.Lu Yao’s Yan Pu (Smoking Manual), appeared around 1774. Lu, a former provincial governor, laid down the rules for nicotine consumption in aristocratic circles. Like a modern etiquette handbook, the manual provided a set of smoking do’s and don’ts: Do Smoke: after waking up; after a meal; with guests; while writing; when growing tired from reading; while waiting for a good friend who hasn’t shown up yet.Don’t Smoke: while listening to a thither; feeding cranes; appreciating orchids; observing plum blossoms; making ancestral offerings; attending the morning court assembly; sleeping with a beautiful woman.From today’s perspective, the Chinese courtier’s ornate surrender to tobacco seems absurd, but it had many equally odd counterparts abroad. Pg. 165-6.Were maize, potatoes, and sweet potatoes entirely responsible for China’s population boom? No. American plants arrived as the Qing dynasty were transforming China. Ambitious on many fronts, the dynasty fought disease and hunger; the nation’s two major killers, by enacting a program, the world’s first, of smallpox inoculation; expanding a nationwide network of granaries that bought surplus grain and sold it at low, state-controlled prices during shortages; and implementing what were, for the era, sophisticated relief programs (some were as simple as a halt in the collection of grain levies in famine-struck areas). At the same time, the Qin campaigned against eh nation’s traditional population-control method: female infanticide. Many Chinese men had spent their days as bachelors, because infanticide removed women from the population. Now more could marry and have babies; now their babies were less likely to die from smallpox and starvation. Now, too, farm families were less likely to be driven into penury by the state: the Kangxi emperor promised in 1713 that the dynasty would never raise the basic tax on cropland, even though it was making massive investments in transportation networks so that farmers could sell their harvests, raising their incomes. Happily, those harvests were likely to grow; the Little Ice Age was waning. Some of these policies had been first emplaced by the Ming; the Qing merely executed them efficiently. But all helped raise the number of children, and the proportion of that number who surveyed to adulthood.Still, as noted by Lan, the Sichuan historian, most of the increase took place in the areas with American crops. The families that Qing policies encouraged to move west needed to eat, and what they ate, day in and day out, was maize, potatoes, and sweet potatoes. Part of the reason China is the world’s most populous nation is the Columbian Exchange. Pg. 176-7.One way to summarized today’s environmental disputes is to say that almost all boil down to the question of whether humankind will continue to accumulate wealth and knowledge, as has been the case since the Industrial Revolution, or whether the environmental impacts of that accusation—soil degradation, loss of biodiversity, consumption of groundwater supplies, climate change—will snap shut the jaws of the Malthusian trap, returning the earth to pre-industrial wretchedness. Alarming in this context, China provides an example of the latter, at least in part. In the deals after American crops sweep into the highlands, the riches society int hew world was convulsed by a struggle with its own environment—a struggle it decisively lost. Pg. 180.Tenochtitlan […] dazzled the Spaniards when they saw it—the city was grander than any in Spain. Pg. 284.The [Spanish] mocharchs, devout Christians, worried that the conquest could not be justified in the eyes of God. Colón’s new lands had the potential of enriching Spain, an outcome they of course views as highly desirable. But obtaining the wealth of the Americas would involve subjugating people who had committed no offence against Spain. As Fernando and Isabel saw it, Indian lands were not like the Islamic empires to whom they and their royal ancestors had fought for centuries. Muslim troops, in their view, could legitimately be enslaved—they had conquered most of Spain, exploited Spanish people, and, by embracing Islam, rejected Christianity. (For similar reasons, the Islamic empires freely enslaved Spanish POWs.) Most Indians, by contrast, had done no wrong to Spaniards. Because American natives had never heard of Christianity, they could not have turned away from it. In 1493, Pope Alexander VI resolved this dilemma of conscience. He awarded the sovereigns “full, free and complete power, authority, and jurisdiction” over the Taino of Hispaniola if they sent “prudent and God-fearing men, learned, skilled, and proven, to instruct [them] in the Catholic faith.” Conquest was acceptable if done for the purpose of brining the conquered to salvation. Pg. 299-300.A hybrid society was coming into existence, first in the Caribbean, then everywhere else in the Americas. The mixing began at the top—Cortés was an example. Like many members of the first generation of conquistadors, Cortés came from Extremadura, a poor, mountainous area controlled by powerful families who had been marrying into each other for generations. His distant cousin was Francisco Pizarro, conqueror of the Inka empire—Pizzaro’s great-uncle was married to Cortes’s aunt. When the intertwined conquistador families married into the equally intertwined families of noble native societies, they produced the kind of baroque, multi branched family trees that wake up genealogists at 3:00 a.m. Pg. 309.

18,0307265722,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3726509-lis-carey,4,"This is the follow-up to Mann's excellent 1491, and it's every bit as excellent. In this book, Mann creates a rich and detailed picture of the world after Columbus, from the first few years of Spanish-Indian interaction through the complex effects of globalization in the contemporary world.He starts, for reasons that soon become clear, with his own garden, and his introduction to heritage tomatoes. Tomato varieties, differing widely in size, appearance, and color, now come from all over the world--but they began as barely edible fruits of the nightshade family in Meso-America. Why are there now wonderful tomatoes from Bulgaria? That's what this book is about in a microcosm: how Columbus's discovery of the Americas led to the dispersal of people, plants, and animals from both hemispheres all over the world.This is a really fascinating exploration of the post-Columbian world, a world of complexity, unexpectedness, and unpredictable mixtures of good and bad effects that are completely lost in any standard telling of the European colonization and conquest of the Americas. It wasn't just European culture and disease impinging on the New World; in fact, Mann makes the point that Eurasia and the Americas in 1492 were both very old worlds, each filled with cultures, history, flora and fauna the other had not suspected.The Europeans, at the beginning of this process, did not think of themselves as Europeans. They were Spanish and English and Portuguese and French and Dutch. The peoples of the Americas didn't think of themselves as Americans, Indians, or any other collective noun; they were Incas and Maya and Sioux and Cherokee and dozens of other names that most of us have never heard. Many of those cultures were virtually destroyed by the arrival of Europeans, not because of European weapons or superior European cultural development (the Triple Alliance, better known to us as the Aztec Empire, and the Inca Empire, were more developed and civilized in most respects than the Spanish who conquered them), but by disease--often before they'd had more than casual contact with Spaniards or any other Europeans. Some of the Indian cultures we think of as ancient, such as the nomadic, horse-riding, buffalo-hunting cultures of the plains Indians, were in fact responses to two effects of the Columbian discovery of the Americas: depopulation due to disease, and the arrival of the horse.But the effects weren't all, or even mostly, one way. American gold and silver had enormous economic consequences in both Spain and China. The potato, the sweet potato, and the tomato had culinary, cultural, and environmental effects all over the world. The Americas had mosquitoes well designed to be vectors for malaria and yellow fever, which didn't exist in this hemisphere; Europeans and Africans brought malaria and yellow fever; the middle-term effect of this was to increase the Atlantic slave trade. This in turn led, eventually and among many other effects, to Toussaint's revolution in Haiti, which led to the sale of France's North American possessions to the US in the Louisiana Purchase...But Mann looks most closely at the effects on smaller scales, all over the world, the impact on how ordinary people live their everyday lives, the good and bad effects of the globalization created by the connecting of the two hemispheres, and what people think of as ""normal"" and ""traditional"" that goes back a few hundred years at most--having been impossible before the hemispheres began to share their plants, animals, and diseases, and to trade with people on the other side of the globe.Mann makes a fascinating, complex, and compelling story of something that could have been either tedious or depressing. Highly recommended.I borrowed this book from a friend."
19,0307265722,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7269595-mary,5,"Loved this book! For every sentence I read in it, author Charles C. Mann read hundreds, and he has the bibliography to prove it.I loved it for two reasons: I love the sweeping overview of human *everything* that Mann provides: foods, migration, slavery, the global trade that preceded--in fact, led to--Columbus's discovery of the New World. And I loved it because it told me so much I didn't know: how the discovery of the potato, in the New World, saved the population of Europe from, if not exactly starvation, then chronic malnutrition. And while I suppose that any assertion like that is open to debate, Mann cites a statue the Nazis destroyed. The statue,in Germany, depicted English pirate/adventurer Sir Francis Drake, holding a potato.Mann insists that Columbus was trying to find China, not India. I'm a little baffled by that - if that's the case, then why didn't they call the people they found Chinese, not Indians? - but he makes a case for China as the supplier of the world's goods even before Columbus set sail.This book upended an assumption I held, unknown to me, that Europe was a dominant world power in the 1400s. It also gave me a much more vivid understanding of the cultures that existed in South America before the Spanish conquest of that continent.There is one section--the Spanish trading with the Chinese in the Philippines--that vividly describes the chaos and bustle of international trade. I could picture the boats and the enclave. There was also a lot of eye-opening information about the native Americans the immigrants to North America found. The native people had a lot of diverse cultures, but what struck me was the news, to me, that one group routinely burned forest undergrowth to make the woods clear for hunting, travel, and agriculture. An author undertaking a book like this, it seems to me, has to decide which authorities he finds most persuasive, and assert their findings. I imagine scholars in the hundreds of specialties that Mann touches upon are itching to correct or refine what he says. But never mind; he has given me a whole scaffolding upon which to base new knowledge. "
20,0307265722,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5725029-maria-kramer,4,"What a fascinating follow-up to ""1491""! This book deals with some of the changes that the ""discovery"" of the Americas wrought on the world stage - not just in Europe, but also in Asia and Africa. Different chapters focus on different topics, such as malaria, the potato, or silver. Very interesting, and an under-explored area of history!"
21,0307265722,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5925902-dan-walker,1,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. So why did I give it only one star??!! Well, I'll tell you.First the good: this is a wide-sweeping review of what Mr. Mann calls the homogenocene - the result of Colombus discovering America and the worldwide mixing of plants, animals, microbes, and humans that has resulted. I learned a lot of historical facts that Mr. Mann spices up with stories that give you a real feel for the boomtowns that sprang up around silver mines and rubber plantations in South America, trading villages in the Philippines, etc. etc., clear around the globe. For example, I never realized what a big event it was when East truly met West in the Philippines - when Spanish sailers met Chinese traders. A whole range of middlemen was cut out, and global trade began to flourish.Mr. Mann does an acceptable job keeping the book balanced. Despite his near-constant snuffling about environmental destruction, he at least recognizes how the homogenocene has lifted millions of people from abject poverty and starvation. And it turns out that anti-global trade rioters race to the barricades, oh, three centuries or so late. I'm afraid fellow-rioters like the king of Spain were staunchly against free trade long, long ago. After all, every ounce of silver that went to China was one less ounce the king could use in his European wars. Turns out its damn hard to control a silver mine on another continent.And it turns out that China has been a source of cheap labor for centuries. Traders were transporting clothing and porcelain across two oceans and the Isthmus in the age of sail and MAKING PROFITS??!! See how late the anti-free trade protestors are?So here's why I gave the book only 1 star. Mr. Mann's strength is also his weakness: he is a correspondent. He's great at putting together a sweeping view of history that real professionals would never tackle because they know they don't have the expertise. But that's his greatest weakness: UNDERSTANDING the facts he lays before readers sometimes requires expert opinion. No problem for a correspondent. Just call up the best-known expert he can find in the Yellow Pages and viola! an explanation appears. The problem is that what he has is just an expert OPINION. Cause and effect is still being debated centuries later. There are other opinions out there. And some of the opinions he publishes are pure stupidity on the face of them.Try this one: ""the Spanish and Chinese economies were ruined by, um, too much silver.""See what I mean about stupidity?Probably realizing that publishing that opinion could get him laughed at, he tries to explain that since the Spanish king didn't index his tax rates, he was driven to bankruptcy by inflation. Well that would be the proper conclusion if one believes in the divine right of kings and their humanist successors, the all-powerful State. The idea that the Spanish king wasted a lot of silver in riotous living and interminable wars couldn't be the reason. No, governments the world over are marked by thrift and prudence in financial matters. It's always someone else's fault when they go broke.Uh huh.So let's get a real explanation of what happened. The king claimed (for reasons that Mr. Mann does not explain) a large chunk of the silver coming out of South America. He was now extremely wealthy - IN SILVER. The problem was that Europe was still only able to produce so many goods and services. Once that load of silver got dropped on the European economy, the result was as predictable as the rising of the sun: the value of silver fell. Or, as Mr. Mann puts it, inflation occurred. Suddenly all the king's silver couldn't buy as many armies and palaces as it could before. He failed to adjust his standard of living downward, and suffered the natural consequences: bankruptcy. Something similar happened in China.So that's why I gave the book only 1 star. On at least this one point Mr. Mann's chosen experts were foolish to the point of imbecility. That and the fact that the book might just be a tax write-off vehicle so that Mr. Mann can deduct his travel expenses. He apparently travelled the globe to ""experience"" the places he wrote about first hand. In only a couple of instances did it seem to add any value to the book. But it's a great idea and more of us should use that method to finance our travels.So read the book. Expand your knowledge of history and how the discovery of the New World forever changed the Old. Listen respectfully to the conclusions but be prepared to challenge them."

She said I would be one of only a few to read them back to back. It is about how the want of silver, sugar and potatoes resulted in today's homogenocene. I oversimplify. I figure this has been going on since prehistoric times. Man throughout his multi-millennial migratory trek took seeds, cuttings and microbes and probably even fire (technology) along to change and often devastate whatever whomever he encountered on that path in search of food and better climes. The author Charles C. Mann explains how it happened since man set sail in search of new lands. Climate and environmental activists should know what Mann makes clear in these two sequential books 1491 and 1493. Our climate and environment is changed forever by those that began traveling the globe in the 15th century and took something from home and something back along for the ride. It is of course still going on today on a mega scale and it is out of control. We are all still blindly doing it. A bloody and indelible mark on the human race: The African slave trade is a major part of the story - this insanely cruel practice that so many profiteers were complicit in. West African chiefs bought and sold captives from tribal wars in much the same way and for the same reasons that Europeans bought and sold land. Some of my English/American ancestors as far back as colonial times who were farmers kept slaves. American Indians traded slaves. The Chinese too. It was ubiquitous. One of the bizarre reasons West Africans were preferred was simply that they were immune to malaria so they could work in steamy equatorial environments and not quickly die in infested regions like Europeans did by the ship-full from one measly mosquito bite. A genetic advantage dealt out randomly that turned out to be a very bad hand indeed. The impact that the European quest for silver and sugar had on indigenous cultures and the environment wherever it touched down was significant and mostly traumatic. Unique and vibrant cultures combined and evolved and thrived as a result. Hispaniola, Brazil, The Philippines, China and Central America are some places affected that are covered in the book. Mann's deep research over three plus years into the written records left by Columbus, the Catholic Church, Spanish, English, Chinese, and many others and with archeological evidence, and his own visits to see for himself, puts our amazing history all together in a way that is only barely known outside scholarly research circles. For me it was a revelation. Highly recommended reading. Non-fiction that reads like historical fiction."
23,0307265722,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72975-marley,4,"I'm sure this is less than a perfect picture of all the nuanced history involved -- it wouldn't be pop history if it weren't. But in that Jared Diamond kind of mold, this is quite a book. The argument runs: Columbus may not have had any idea what he was doing, but he's still the genesis of an entirely changed world -- a world connected all the way round, economically and (and here's the kicker) therefore biologically. You make a world market, you remake Pangaea, extremely messily.Each chapter just takes a thread and runs with it, peppering you with hundreds of fascinating shards of history, so you're not getting a summary. Instead, big themes are: proto-globalization, and the first world consumer crazes; tracking Andean silver as it hyperinflates one currency after another (Spain, of course, but CHINA far worse); The Philippines as the place the West finally pulled off Columbus' gambit and found the East from behind;the invention of the Chinatown from Manila to Mexico City; potatoes as they travel out of the Inka homeland (one tiny clone fragment of an intensely biodiverse cloud of species) and give the Irish vastly better nutrition (and famine);sweet potatoes as they make huge portions of western China suddenly farmable, then cause their OWN famine;The way the Triangular Trade/chattel slavery and the silver/silk trade with the East were intimately linked;Malaria, also known as the reason New World jungles were a great place to live until we showed up;Malaria, also known as one of the things that shaped the creation plantation economies filled with slaves from West Africa;Slavery, a violent forced immigration which DWARFED any such movements to the new-found continents by white Europeans until the Victorian Era.In all, a pretty fascinating book. A bit too globalization-is-just-a-force-of-nature/Thomas Friedman, and a bit too cute with its modern-day correspondences, but intense food for thought.Also, worth noting that Chinese emissaries from a Ming Dynasty emperor showed up in Manila demanding the truth of rumors of a magical mountain of gold and silver where precious metals were free for the asking. The Spanish posted there were so taken aback that they massacred the entire trade settlement. This happened a lot, apparently.It's an unfathomable world, folks. We just live here."
24,0307265722,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3112117-christina-dudley,5,"A fabulous, unique read. Mann follows the manifold, global consequences of Columbus touching down in Hispaniola. One of those books where you learn SO much! Just to name one example, the whole discussion of American slavery was revelatory--how the native African resistance to malaria and yellow fever played in, how traditions of slavery in Africa differed from how the Europeans used slaves, and how race as we now think of it was not the huge factor we deem it, with our contemporary mindset.Also fascinating were the ecological consequences of ""reuniting Pangaea,"" as Mann puts it. New World crops made their way to Europe and Asia, allowing population booms that put pressure on the environment. Old World critters and plants made their way to the New World. Who knew there were no earthworms in Virginia?Crazy what-ifs fill the book. What if Scotland hadn't emptied its coffers trying to establish a bastion in Panama, a venture that ended in total failure when just about everyone died of mosquito-borne disease? Financially desperate, Scotland accepted its incorporation into the United Kingdom. What if Europe had imported more than one kind of potato (of the thousands of varieties), leaving itself less vulnerable to total crop loss from potato blight? Would America have experienced the waves of famine-driven immigration?The only dull bits were the somewhat disjointed accounts of maroon settlements (escaped African slaves) mostly in South America, but the first 9/10 of the book were so awesome that I couldn't justify deducting a star!"
25,0307265722,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2505581-gary-brecht,4,"Like his previous work, 1491, the author uses Christopher Columbus’s European discovery of the New World as a pivotal point in history; in this case, what changes occurred to our world in the wake of this momentous discovery? The task of deciding which threads of history are worth writing about is no less daunting than the act of retracing each significant event that will elucidate and enhance his story. By organizing his history into four main categories Mann is able to get a hold of this unwieldy subject. After that it becomes similar to reverse engineering a complex mechanical device as he tries to trace each noteworthy change in our environment since the time of Columbus’s discovery. First there are the diseases like malaria and yellow fever; then there are the botanical swaps that occur, like the use of maize, potatoes, and peppers; and the human changes like the introduction of Europeans, Africans and Asians to the Western Hemisphere and the subsequent intermingling of these races with the indigenous population. Prior to Mann’s 1943 these changes were referred to as the “Columbian Exchange.” Mann also refers to it as the homogenecene, or if you will, the homogenization of species on our planet.The story is full of surprises and because it has been so well researched it should be regarded as a welcome addition to the history section of any library.

26,0307265722,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8079117-becky,4,"So, so glad I was able to get my hands on this during the summer. I read the predecessor, 1491, because Mann came to Wilmington as the Honors Spring Speaker. This book seemed less dry than 1491 but also less mind blowing. Perhaps this was a result of hearing Mann's speech in which he mostly talked about 1493. Perhaps this was a result of taking AP Euro in high school. I knew a lot of what the book talked about based on Mann's speech, though the details he had not included were still interesting. I also enjoyed the tangents he went on in regards to European, African, Indian, and Asian history. From this book (and 1491) you will gain a greater knowledge of the before and after American (and by American I mean the NORTH and SOUTH American, not U.S.) picture than you would ever have gained from your somewhat sanitized AP Euro or AP US History class. Great read, very fascinating. Thanks again for expanding on what I know and changing what I thought I knew, Mr. Mann. "
27,0307265722,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4708829-carole,5,"A worthy successor to 1492, although to me slightly less absorbing at times. Gathering up new or overlooked research produces a world picture that shows the narrow viewpoint of our traditional Western education. There are many aha moments, such as the fact that the majority of early non indigenous arrivals in the western hemisphere were in fact black Africans. The interaction of escaped black slaves and indigenous Indians and the emergence of powerful maroon communities is also illuminating. There were Chinese in South American and a brisk Pacific trade. The movement of plants, such as tobacco, potatoes, and sugar, around the world are explored and their impact explained. Reading Mann's two books will change your outlook and understanding of our world,."

29,0307265722,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73548608-helio,4,"1493 by Charles C MannThe book may have been called 1642 as many items noted were from that year. The title comes from events that occurred after 1492 (Colon’s voyage to the Americas). It is difficult to quantify the magnitude of Mann’s information as he talks about the influence of tobacco, the mutinies of Chinese in Manilla, the implication of sugar cane plantations, the rubber wars from the Amazon, and slaves escaping to form their own communities. Some of the world’s top crops are from the Americas: sugar cane, maize, potatoes and tomatoes. Chinas is now the second largest producer of maize. 1493 is an engrossing read with many interesting historical notes such as:P23/24 silver (from Bolivia) was traded across the Pacific for silk, sweet potatoes and maizeP25	Mann views Manilla (where Spanish ships laden with sliver would exchange goods (mostly silk) with Chinese ships in the Philiphines as the birthplace of globalization, what he calls the HomogenoceneP28	Because of its cockiness of being awash in silver Mann notes “In 1642 Spain is combatting secession in Andalusia, Catalonia and Portugal [as well as the fight to stop rebellion in the Netherlands]… France is fighting Spain on its eastern, northern and southern borders; and Swedish armies are battling the Holy Roman Empire… The costs are staggering. At the height of the Vietnam War the U.S. had fielded about 500,000 soldiers; it would have had to send 2.5 million to match the proportion that Spain did with its war with the Dutch. Even though Spain had all this silver coming from Bolivia it didn’t have enough to pay its army in the Netherlands… There were forty-five mutinies between 1572 and 1607 and that was just one of Spain’s wars… in 1642 so much silver has been produced that its value is falling… The richest nation in the world is hurtling toward financial Armageddon… Spain’s economic collapse is dragging down its neighbors.’P30	Worldwide there was a Little Ice Age from about 1550 to 1750 which might be attributed to so many Indians perishing (due to disease) they no longer set the woods on fire for clearing. “Indigenous pyromania had long pumped CO2 into the air… the pump suddenly grows feeble. Formerly open grasslands fill with forest – a frenzy of photosynthesis… Forests regenerate across swatches of North America, Mesoamerica, the Andes and Amazonia…” the reduction in CO2 lends itself to a cooling of the earth.P43	“In all of history, humankind has been able to domesticate only twenty-five mammals, a dozen or so birds and possibly a lizard [the iguana]” Later on Mann says it is forty mammalsP 47	Maize grew pumpkins, squash, gourds, melon and beans – they weren’t grown plantation style but such that they supported one another in nutrients, shade and beans climbing the corn stalks.P55	“… Spain, formerly a ‘poore and barren nation’ was now so rich, that incredibly, its seamen had almost stopped being thieves. England, by sad contrast, was ‘moste infamous’ for its ‘outrageous, common and daily piracies’.”P64	Pocahontas real name was MataokaP72	“The English imported bees for honey, not to help their crops … but feral honeybees pollinated farms and orchards anyway. Without them, many of the plants the Europeans brought with them, wouldn’t have proliferated.”P 75	Tobacco was the first American species to disperse around the world. “Fun, exciting and wildly addictive, tobacco was an instant hit around the globe”P 100	Mosquitos brought malaria and yellow fever from Africa which struck down Europeans but not so much Africans who had the Duffy antigen so that the parasites couldn’t break into the red blood cells.P 140	“The silver from Potosi, Bolivia was so pure [50%] the Spaniards did not know how to purify it. Andean Indians had some of the worlds’ most advanced metallurgy. Locals were able to do what the foreigners couldn’t… by 1611 Pototsi was a big as London or Amsterdam. It was the highest, richest city in the world.”P232	A DNA mutation on a Mexican beetle made it go after the potato – hence the blight that ravaged the European potato crops.P274	Contracts were made with villagers in China to grow rubber plants. Mann likened the contracts as a “kind of document that emerges when one party has a lawyer… and the other party doesn’t know what a lawyer is.”P282	“The alliance commonly known as the Aztec empire … was a consortium of three militarized city states…Texcoco, Tlacopan and Tenochtitlan… this triple alliance ruled Mexico from ocean to ocean and Tenochtitlan was bigger than any city in Spain.P 286	 “Between 1500s and 1840 the heyday of the slave trade, 11.7 million captive Africans left for America. In that period perhaps 3.4 million Europeans emigrated.” Mann mentions later on that one third to one half of the slaves died within four-five years and more than that perished on the journey across the Atlantic. Although significant the number of Europeans dying was not that high.P 304	“Cortes’ first ranch hand, possibly the first cowboy… was an African slave.Mann offers some humorous passages such as:P 346	“Labor [for gold mines] was to be provided by enslaving local Indians… The Indians saw no reason to participate in this scheme and expressed their lack of enthusiasm by riddling the invaders with poisonous arrows.”"
30,0307265722,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71333442-aaron-s,5,"You can already see that I've given this book a high rating, so I'm going to break my pattern and start with the criticisms. This is partially because the criticisms I have are pretty small and also because they start with the book's very title and identity. The title, 1493: Uncovering the New World Columbus Created is clearly intended to read as a sequel to his previous book 1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus (which I also loved). This is not actually true though. The two books have incredibly different focuses, structures, and purposes. 1491 was essentially a history book, using a great deal of archaeological evidence and secondary sources to detail the vast and complex history of the Americas before and during the arrival of Europeans. Naturally, I assumed this book would be a follow-up detailing the history of the Americas after that momentous event, focused on indigenous inhabitants. 1493, though, is not a history book. It is an extremely varied book that jumps around regularly from topic to topic and forward and back in time, regularly following a train of thought through several centuries all with multiple divergences. I'm not precisely sure what I would call the book, but ultimately what it seeks to accomplish is to focus on all the myriad ways the connection of these two worlds changed the entire globe, not just culturally, but physically, with the entire natural landscape of the world undergoing massive changes with the introduction of foreign flora, fauna, and disease from one continent to another. And where 1491 focused clearly on the native inhabitants (whom Mann refers to as Indians when speaking of in general terms for complicated reasons), this book is far more focused on the rest of the world, detailing how vastly Europe, China, and Africa were affected by this exchange. The book seeks to essentially analyze the creation and refinement of a globalized, connected society which did not truly exist until after the Americas were contacted.  My criticism here has nothing to do with the books quality. I think this book was just as interesting and enlightening as the previous one. The only issue is that it delivers something entirely different than what readers are led to expect. People who want a history of ""Indians"" after Europeans arrived don't get the book they're looking for, and people who actually want what this book delivers are unlikely to discover it unless someone happens to recommend it to them.  My only other criticism is that the book is very unfocused. This is somewhat understandable since the scope of the book is such that it is basically attempting to touch on the entirety of our current world's circumstances, which isn't really possible to do in a single book, and so it relies largely on digging deep into a few specific examples as a way of showcasing the many other possible areas of focus. Aside from that, Mann just isn't an especially organized or focused writer, with each chapter going on so many divergences that I can't really say that most of them actually feel like they have a specific identity of their own. This is especially glaring in the Africa chapter. I was initially very intrigued at the prospect of looking into the history of Africa as it develops from American influence, but aside from a few mentions of corn/maize becoming a staple crop there (just like basically everywhere else in the world) the chapter doesn't really deal with Africa the continent at all. It does focus quite a lot on Africans, going into great detail on the slave trade and the history of escaped slave societies in the Americas (which was personally my favorite section of the book). But so much of the detail focused on Central and South American Indians that I often had to remind myself that this chapter was nominally focused on Africans. Now that I've gotten my complaints out of the way, let me say in no uncertain terms: this is a great book. I tend to have a harder time with non-fiction books holding my interest but I never wanted to put this one down in favor of the novels I was also reading at the time. The scattershot approach, while disorganized, meant that I never knew where the book was going to go next and there was a never-ending parade of surprises. And this book is surprising. It's amazing just how much of the history in this book is either glossed over or completely ignored by typical education institutions and largely unknown in pop-culture. It's not an exaggeration to say that it changed my view of the world as a whole.  A big part of what makes this book work well is Mann playing to his strengths. Mann has a history as a scientific journalist, and it shows very clearly in the way that he approaches the topics of this book through a scientific focus. Where most historical writings I've read tend to focus on the human element of ""what happened when and why,"" Mann focuses very strongly on the ""how."" Delving deep into topics like diseases vectors and how certain groups of people develop immunity, agricultural innovations, and unintended spread of flora and fauna, Mann paints a very broad picture of the entire planet undergoing vast reconstruction without any intelligent agent working towards that end. He gets a little overboard sometimes (I know more about mosquitoes now than I ever wanted to) but the depth of explanations given for these things makes it possible to understand the full consequences and implications of things like new crops spreading across the ocean and how they may have caused life expectancy and population growth to skyrocket, or how the devastation of disease created the unique circumstances that facilitated the complex race relations between Europeans, Africans, and Indians in the Americas.   There is a lot of detail in this book that I simply knew nothing about, and that I think anyone interested in history of any kind would find interesting. Mann sheds a pragmatic light on the African and Indian slave trade using historical records that don't line up remotely with the vague sketches typically used to describe it in modern times. I think this book would be of especial interest to those interested in the history of African and indigenous American peoples since it devotes quite a lot of its word count to the complex relationships between those peoples that I've literally never seen any mention of before outside of a few specific stories. As I mentioned above my personal favorite part of the book was the history of ""maroon"" societies: independent polities formed by escaped African slaves living in concert with people from vastly different African societies, local Indians, and small scatterings of Europeans. I've always wondered why there weren't more successful slave rebellions or escapes in the Americas, and this section showed that my assumption was wrong: there were tons of such successful societies, many of them which waged war on colonial forces for decades or even centuries and many of which were eventually granted legal legitimacy. I recommend this book to anyone interested in the process of globalization, since that is ultimately what it is about, as well as those who are interested in the gaps in history that public education tends to ignore. Just know that this is very much not a book about America or Americans. The title ""The New World Columbus Created"" refers not to the formation of Europeanized America but to the creation of the global world as we know it, a world were the actions performed on one continent create ripples that have enormous consequences on every other one.  Trying to sum up this book is extremely difficult, so if anyone out there is considering reading it and has any questions on its content feel free to comment and ask me and I'll do my best to answer any questions you have.

31,0307265722,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13546014-christopher-saunders,4,"Charles C. Mann's 1493 examines the impact of European colonization of the New World in a variety of fashions. Mann makes the argument that the Columbian Exchange was one of the Earth's most important events, with impacts both immediate and long-term, obvious and subtle. Not only white conquest and settlement (and the destruction of Native cultures) but the establishment of slavery, which in turn stimulated modern capitalism and devastated the African continent; not only disease and technology but the exchange of animals and crops with a truly worldwide impact, shifting entire ecosystems and uprooting human habits at once. Thus people, not only in Europe but Asia, Africa and the Middle East, found themselves reaping the benefits and drawbacks of a truly global economy: growing addicted to tobacco, sugar and coffee, refocusing cuisine and culture around maize and potatoes, valuing stimulated trade and capital as marks of ""progress."" It's all written in a surprisingly accessible fashion, with Mann juggling his various disciplines and approaches with enviable ease. "

The gist of 1491 is that European technology and numbers were insufficient to conquer the native peoples of the Americas at the end of the 15th century. The number of indigenous peoples and the sophistication of their cultures far exceeds what was taught in school when I was a kid. The myth of virgin wilderness in the Americas is just that a myth. The forests of the amazon and of North America were carefully tended agricultural plots, maintained by a large and advanced population exploiting and husbanding both animal and plants. Had the Indians been resistant to European Diseases such as Small Pox the Europeans would have barely made a toe hold and would have stacked up on the shores as isolated trading ventures. It is entirely possible that in time Europe could have mustered the forces to invade, however in the interim the exchange of trade goods and specifically weapons would have rapidly diminished the European advantage.1493 is a careful analysis of “unintended consequences” of the “Columbian Exchange.” Far reaching it offers up new explanations of “the Little Ice Age“, Chinese isolationism and African Slavery in a suddenly globally connected world.Some of it is, at first glance, quaint- who knew there were no earth worms in the North East? Some of it scary- the introduction of the earth worm completely changed the ecology of the forests. Indentured servants as agricultural workers make for a better economic model- until you factor in their mortality rates from malaria, which the English introduced at which point African Slaves become viable economically. Who knew that England was a malarial miasma? The Chinese weren’t necessarily isolationists- prior to Spanish Silver extracted from South America coming to market- Europe offered nothing that interested the Chinese.The quirky factoids are enjoyable, the thoughtful analysis is an exercise in delving deep."
33,0307265722,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4651295-jason-furman,5,"A remarkable global history from 1493 to the present, describes the trade and exchange of people, plants, commodities, and microorganisms between Europe, the Americas, Asia and Africa. It is nowhere nearly as original as Charles Mann's previous 1491, with presented a revolutionary portrait of pre-Columbian America, nor Guns, Germs and Steel, which covers some of the same terrain. But it is still a thoughtful, balanced, creative, and large-scale history of what the author, following earlier works, calls the ""Columbian exchange."" The book is journalistic in nature and draws on a wide variety of research including conventional history, genetics, environmental studies, farm studies, and economic history.Mann's thesis is that since 1493, a massive Transatlantic and Transpacific trade has helped create a new era in global environmental history, the Homogenocene -- which is a homogenizing of the people, plants and people around the world. Some of the exchanges he describes are well known and well documented, like the slave trade. Others I had never heard of, like the large role that the guano mining and trade played in 19th century agriculture. All of them are described in a vivid and humanizing way, for example describing the horrors of guano mining by essentially enslaved Chinese laborers, the boomtowns that it created in Peru, the cartels that controlled it, and the impact it had on European agriculture. In between these levels of familiarity, are detailed descriptions of the trade in tobacco, silver, the potato, rubber, rice, sugarcane, malaria and yellow fever.In the course of this, the book covers the agricultural revolution, the industrial revolution, the founding of the America's and the rise of Europe. It is also interesting in that it spends as much time on China and Asia, not just as a source of materials for the West but also in describing how the trade in items like silver and the potato transformed Asian economies, societies, and even their physical topographies. The Philippines get a particularly interesting treatment in the book, as the crossroads of the Asia, the New World, and Europe.I appreciate Mann's balance in writing the book. He is unstinting in his descriptions of the human and ecological horrors brought by the exchange. But he is also clear and forthright about their massive benefits that these exchanges have brought."
34,0307265722,http://goodreads.com/user/show/293178-caroline,5,"I thoroughly enjoyed Mann's other book on this general topic, 1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus, so I was quite keen to read this one. 1491 charted the history of America before Columbus' arrival and the dramatic changes that occured as a result. 1493 is in effect an expansion on a theory expounded in 1491, what is known as the Columbian Exchange. Whilst 1491 dwelt almost solely on the impact of Columbus' discovery of the America on the original inhabitants, 1493takes a global look at the impact of the Columbian Exchange, a worldwide translocation of people, plants, animals, pests and diseases as a result of the sudden contact between two previous disparate hemispheres.Crops previously indigeonous to the Americas becames staples across the world - potatoes. maize and tomatoes in Europe, peanut and manioc in Africa, rubber to Southeast Asia. And that's not mentioning the introduction of malaria and yellow fever to the Americas, or animals such as the horse and cow, even the honey bee! The impact in some places is staggering. Even something as small as an earthworm can destroy millennia-old systems of agriculture in less than a decade.It's quite sobering, in fact, just how much of an impact the introduction of one species to a new area can have on the native plants and animals. Dutch Elm Disease, for example, is a direct result of the Columbian Exchange. The potato blight is another. Grey squirrels in the British Isles driving out the native red population. Kudzu vine in America is another.This is a fascinating read, as I've come to expect from Mann, to see just how much the world has shrunk and homogenised over time. Plants that seem such a fixture of particular countries, like tomatoes in Italy or potatoes in Ireland, are in fact 'exotic' imports. The potato in particular had an immense effect on the population in Europe, and yet one hardly reads about it in the history books. I would personally make this book required reading for schools and colleges. It's an immensely important study, and reading the impact of what Mann calls the Homogenocene Era from a global perspective makes you realise just how small our world is now and how inter-connected.

Considering I never ever eat fast-food, after reading this book I got a new sense of the world around me, looking differently at all these inventions of industry and society leading to world homogeneity...The 'Homogenocene' - an era of world history triggered by Christopher Columbus' arrival into the new world - a biological era referring to the mixing of unlike substances to create a new blend...From the silver found in the mountains of Bolivia which became Chinese currency, to tomatoes originated in South America that found its way as a staple into the Mediterranean diet...And from Europe's sweet tooth that drove an insatiable demand for sugar creating the sugar plantations run by African slaves, to the industrial revolutions need for rubber which gave way to espionage to find the best strains of the tree that would overcome disease leading to wealth....This book has it all... It's like so many books in one...From the origins of slavery in the Madeira and São Tomé islands, and how it thrived below the Mason-Dixon Line in the south of the US, to how it was affected and isolated by the spread of malaria and yellow-fever, eventually freeing the slaves allowing them to create new communities in the new world...It all points to The Colombian Exchange... A huge global shock to the way the planet has existed with its natural course of evolution...American history often describes Europeans entering a nearly empty wilderness.... However for centuries after the discovery of the new world, most of the newcomers were African, and the land was not empty, but filled with millions of indigenous people...""Much of the great encounter between the two halves of the world thus was less a meeting of Europe and America than a meeting of Africans and Indians - a relationship forged both in the cage of slavery and the uprising against it.""As the author so eloquently explains, Christopher Columbus did not discover the new world, instead with the Homogenocene, he created it."
36,0307265722,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2031662-peter,4,"This is a rambling, fascinating analysis of the origins of globalization and what Mann calls the ""homogenocene,"" the homogenization of ecologies around the world since Columbus ""discovered"" the New World, and malaria was exchanged for potatoes, to oversimplify just a tad. Mann offers a balanced account of the benefit of this globalization that has been going on for centuries, and which if we have ever eaten tomatoes or corn, for example, we have benefited from. But he's far from blind to its often appalling costs. For example, the potted history of Sao Tome and Principe that he gives in the course of a few pages is one of the most depressing accounts of centuries of human greed, exploitation and misery I've read (the plantation system there served as a kind of model for slavery in the Americas).There are plenty of eye-opening surprises here. I was entirely ignorant of the fact that the first cowboys in the Americas were African slaves (probably on Cortes's vast estate South of Mexico City), and that indeed the cowboy tradition of freedom and reliance on nobody originated (oversimplifying again a bit obviously) not in the Western US, but on the plains of West Africa, with its millennia-old traditions of horsemanship and cattle tending. And there are also plenty of rather inspiring stories here of resistance of escaped African slaves and American Indians and other outsiders who established communities that managed in some cases to stay more or less under the radar into the present century. Another of the nuggets among tons of engrossing accounts that struck me was the fact that the Muslim solution in the Middle East to the fact that sugar production from sugar cane required intensive, readily available labor was to pay workers very well, so that they would be encouraged to stay. The Christian Europeans, who discovered sugar through the first Crusade, came up with their own, appalling solution to this labor problem."
37,0307265722,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3327630-alan-kaplan,4,"Excellent book by the author of 1491. Everything in the world changed with Columbus's discovery of the America's. Globalization did not begin today or in the last 100 years. Globalization began immediately when Columbus stepped food on Hispaniola. The Americas were filled with cultures and innumerable people. Globalization led to the import of measles, small pox, and ever malaria. Defenseless natives fell quickly to these invisible invaders.Potatoes, native to the Americas, were exported all over the world. Invasive species are everywhere, not just kudzu but all of the products in our farms and gardens. Interesting facts abound, there were no earthworms in North America. They were all killed in the ice age, but returned to this country, unknowingly by European settlers. When the first settlers arrived, they saw no fences and no European type fields, but the native Americans were excellent farmers. Their fields just looked different - they planted many different crops in the same place - peaceful coexistence, so what looked to be just scrub and forest, were in fact organized farming communities. Mann delves into slavery. How did African wind up being slaves? Mann's thesis is invaluable. We forget the scourges of malaria and yellow fever. Many Africans were immune to these plagues. Therefore, they were able to exist in tropical climates. Europeans, on the other hand, died very quickly when they arrived in America. Settlers died in frigthful numbers. Settlers needed to be ""seasoned."" The Mason Dixon really separated malarial lands to the south from colder climes to the north. Therefore, slavery flourished in the south and never really took hold in the north. Fascinating book on how the world became what it is."
38,0307265722,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76105804-rick-wilson,4,"An interesting look into the origins of the modern world and what the author calls Homogenocene Age. A homogenization of the world through the exchange of a small handful of plants and animals. Mann gets into the weeds of the Columbian exchange. One of the main drivers of this homogenization. And throughout much of the book, he shows the two sides of this coin. For example, bringing potatoes to Europe from the Andes gave nutrient rich food to millions of people. Probably preventing the Malthusian Trap of famine and death from increasing population growth. The fertilizer from bird shit in the Atlantic and Pacific further assisted agriculture, allowing exponential productivity out of the same land. But....... Mann asserts that the mold in that same bird shit, carted into Europe by the boatload, was the culprit for the eventual famine and death across Europe that followed. We know this as the Irish Potato Famine. What globalization gives, it also can take away. I also found the parts on China fascinating, for while the Europeans were pillaging and looting the Americas, China was content with being the foremost power in the world. It's not that they weren't interested in colonoization like the Europeans, it's that they didn't care. They didn't believe the rest of the world had anything to offer them, and for the most part, that assumption was true. Their interactions with the Spanish and their silver were some of my personal highlights of the book. I didn't find the whole book as riveting as 1491, but I think that's more a matter of taste than a reflection on the book. If anyone know a good book on the history of China, I am all ears."
39,0307265722,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1590672-sandy-d,5,"This is a massive but not overly academic book (not jargon heavy at all!) that covers the birth of the modern world - the globalization that happened after the ""discovery"" of the New World - culturally, economically, and environmentally.Mann's research is amazing. And I've had enough rather specialized education in some of the areas he describes (like colonial Jamestown and 16-17th c. Mexico) to appreciate the depth of Mann's work.But the writing style - which makes complex ideas (even stuff I'm not at all interested in, like 16th c. Chinese economy and politics) accessible - is what really blew me away.In short, this was a perfect storm of ideas, research, and execution. This is the kind of thing that Michael Pollan did for food in ""Omnivore's Dilemma"", but for history, especially environmental history. If you have any interest at all in those topics, I can't recommend this highly enough. I learned an amazing amount about tobacco, rubber, guano, potatoes, mosquitoes, malaria, yellow fever, slavery, race and class in Latin America, Chinese pirates, silver, and Spanish and Portuguese conquistadors. Which all seems rather scattered, but Mann shows just how it's all connected and *very* relevant to our world today.I think this book will probably win some awards this year. If it doesn't, it definitely should. "
40,0307265722,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15033777-matthew-griffiths,5,"This was an excellent study of how Columbus' ""discovery"" of the Americas completely revolutionised life across the earth in numerous ways and how it continues to do so till this day. In terms of content this book was excellent in its varied yet thorough approach to the topics it discussed and it certainly covered a wide range of these. A particularly refreshing approach the writer used was to abandon the Euro-centric approach that is usually adopted when discussing the colonisation of the Americas and trade with Asia and to suggest that actually Sino-centric and Afro-centric views are far more appropriate.Similarly refreshing also was that the author in discussing globalisation stayed neutral towards this often controversial concept, in doing so he repeatedly pointed out that we need to view the process of globalisation as a two way street that offers both gains and losses rather than something which is all bad or all good.My only complaint as such was that unfortunately the author didn't spend much time discussing the evolution of homogenized cultures as a result of the Columbian Exchange except other to hint at it briefly in the chapter that discussed the Maroons in the Americas. Despite this however I would highly recommend this book to anyone who was remotely interested in any of the varied topics it discusses."
41,0307265722,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7462335-maria,5,"I liked ""1493"" really much, because I am addicted to books which offer a broad range of historical facts, creating an overarching history of a certain era. This book is one of these rare books which create a new view on an era that one thought to know.Nevertheless, the book had its strong parts - and there were weaker parts, too. I especially liked the 1st chapter and the last one, which were the ones dealing with the first centuries of amerindian-european-african-asian contact. These were so lively and full of amazing facts, woven into a history of interacting parties all over the world, that I was simply astounded. The parts I would have liked to be more specific were the ones about the spread of European diseases in the Americas (which he mentioned with some fascinating facts about the results of this spreading but not got into too deeply) and about the interaction of biological species (apart from the Malaria insects, the potatoe, tobacco and sweet potatoes) between the continents. The author offerd an insight into these fields, but in my opinion he stayed at the outer sides of this fasscinating topic. "
42,0307265722,http://goodreads.com/user/show/663291-scot,5,"Fascinating exploration of the process of globalization, not in the late 20th or early 21st century, but via the economic, biological, environmental, and human ethnic/racial shifts that were triggered by the symbolic visit of Columbus to the New World. It is a thick book, and you can read it incrementally while you are also reading something else and still get full enjoyment from it. I haven't read Mann's lauded earlier work, 1491, but the complex interconnections discussed here reinforced knowledge I already had, taught me several things about places and time periods I didn't know sufficiently, and helped me see the intricate ways so much is interconnected. We are talking the whole planet here, so disabuse yourself from notions this is a just a book about White Europeans settling the Americas, and prepare to learn about the Orient and the Occident, Africa and Amazonia, integrating natural sciences, social sciences, history, and an appreciation for cultural traditions, practices, and beliefs as they change over time in societies all around the world.Mann has helped me rethink how I plan to give more than a few lectures in the future. Well done, and thank you, sir."
43,0307265722,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1925476-donna-jo-atwood,4,"The older I get the more I understand the inter-connectedness of history. Mann, using a huge variety of sources, pulls together the way Columbus's ""discovery"" of the New World set in motion the way our world is connected today, from ecology, through food (can you say pizza?), slavery, and disease, to economics and political processes.I really liked this book, especially since it didn't just focus on the Europe to South America angle, but brought in the thriving trade with China. Mann admits that he left out many countries in the interests of simplifying a complex concept, but the book was very satisfying anyway.I recommend this for people who are even slightly interested in history. The Intro and first chapter were a little slow going, stick with it. They are worth reading in light of later chapters. I especially appreciated Mann's humor--not obtrusive, but fun."
44,0307265722,http://goodreads.com/user/show/974210-erik-graff,4,"This book is only in part a continuation of 1491's description of the Americas before Columbus. Spanning the period from then to the present, it is in part a history of biological exchange, in part a history of trade and, in repeated excurses, in part a history of the globalization of slavery. As regards the latter, most notable is how Mann makes slaves, particularly black slaves, the agents of their own--and the Americas'--history."
45,0307265722,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16915926-jill-cordry,1,"Mann purports 1493 to be an update, using new scientific evidence and access, of Alfred W. Crosby's ECOLOGICAL IMPERIALISM. This book is not nearly as informative as Crosby's books, but contains lots of narrative and background on people, rather than the ""exchange"". The reader would be much better off reading ECOLOGICAL IMPERIALISM itself as well as Crosby's other book: THE COLUMBIAN EXCHANGE."
46,0307265722,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13385989-lisa,4,"Fascinating and also felt all over the place - I'm not sure how much of that was due to the audiobook format, but I was able to appreciate most of the flow of information, even if it sometimes felt transient."
47,0307265722,http://goodreads.com/user/show/216786-ken-ichi,3,"Much like 1491, this book features a vague thesis (exchange between the Americas and the rest of the world in the past 500 years has shaped the present) over which Mann drapes digression upon digression, some of them fascinating, others decidedly less so, all thoroughly cited, but few of those citations referring to primary sources. Here's what I found interesting:Chinese demand for silver drove a great deal of European expansionWhen I think about the motives for European colonialism, I think of greed, flight from religious persecution, and geopolitical maneuvering. A Chinese capital sink was not on my radar, but Mann did a good job convincing me it played a role. I would have liked to see more exploration of what might have happened without a huge consumer for American silver. Inflation? Also, Chinese currency history and the endless successions of retribution in Potosi? Not that interesting. Summarize, cite, and move on, please.Jamestown was a corporate enterprise, not a government one.This was a minor point in the book, but I hadn't realized one of America's founding colonies wasn't exactly a bunch of people trying to reinvent themselves or the English crown making a land grab, but rather a corporation trying to turn a buck. Corporate greed is more deeply rooted in our history than I thought!Success of old-world tropical diseases predicated social institutions, particularly slaveryThis was one of his larger points. Aside from the irony that Europeans generally failed to survive in tropical regions of the Americas because of diseases they brought with them from the tropics in other parts of the world, Mann focused primarily on the way these diseases shaped demographics and cultural institutions, drawing mostly from the work of Daron Acemoglu, Simon Johnson, and James Robinson at MIT. Obviously it's hard/impossible to prove disease played a greater role than, say, suitability of an area for crops that can be grown en masse and require a lot of manual labor, but I think Mann successfully summarized the importance of disease. Acemoglu et al's work goes on to explore how differences in social / governmental institutions that were related to disease have influenced current economic success, basically pointing out that colonies where Europeans settled in large numbers are more economically successful today than colonies where they maintained small numbers but employed many slaves (they do a lot to separate the influence of disease on institution forming and the influence of institutions on economic success from other factors that I don't entirely understand, but I believe that's the gist). I wonder how this kind of analysis holds up when applied to US states, comparing slave and non-slave states.American tubers and tobacco facilitated population booms and population expansion into agriculturally marginal areas in China and Europe, facilitating huge social and landscape changesMany people seem surprised to learn that Italians hadn't heard of tomatoes before Columbus, or that the Irish weren't eating potatoes since the dawn of time, or that southeast asians weren't turbo charging their cuisine with hot chilies before Europeans showed up with their wimpy palates. If you're one of those people, be surprised no longer: all these veggies come from the Americas, along with tobacco, sweet potatoes, and corn/maize. If you're a food/history nerd, though, this probably isn't news. What I found interesting was the history of how productive, nutritional crops that could be grown in marginal soil abetted landscape changes in China (migration to hillier terrain, deforestation, increased erosion, catastrophic flooding), and how potatoes assuaged famine and may have effected political stability in European nations as those countries were industrializing and expanding their reach.There were many synthetic communities of escaped African slaves that survived well into the presentI was totally unaware of these ""maroon"" cities, so this was definitely interesting. Much as the bulk of 1491 was an effort to illuminate agency among American Indian peoples, these chapters did the same for Africans in the Americas. However, I wanted to see more about how these independent hybrid cultures influenced the present. Candomblé was mentioned, along with some of Brazil's other Christianish religions, but it would have been cool to learn about what components of these practices originated in maroon communities and not among slaves.  Overall, interesting stuff. I would have liked to see some exploration of one of Mann's least supported assertions in 1491, namely that American democratic principles were influenced by Indian example, but maybe he's saving that for another book.

48,0307265722,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7726561-ted-hunt,5,"This book is a fascinating look at the global, long-term impact of the arrival of Europeans in the western hemisphere. Mann's book ""1491"" was an examination of life in the western hemisphere before the arrival of Columbus in 1492, and while ""1493"" is not a ""sequel"" in the traditional sense of this word, it does pick up the story of arrival of the Europeans with Columbus's expedition, which is where the previous book ended. Mann's second book is actually a far more expansive look at the repercussions of the events of the late 15th century. The author's thesis is pretty simple: the notion of ""globalization"" did not begin in the 19th or 20th century, but actually in 1492, with the arrival of the Spanish in the western hemisphere. He does not focus so much on the notions of economic forces, but more on biology. In Mann's view, Columbus's arrival began the process of recreating Pangaea, the single continent that existed over 300 million years ago. His approach is both ""macro"" and ""micro;"" he describes the enormous changes brought about by the arrival of Europeans in the west whose impacts are still being felt, but the book also examines very precise topics like tobacco, silver, rubber, yellow fever and malaria, and grass. The last part of the book looks at the racial mixing that took place in the western hemisphere after 1492, with some surprising details, such as the fact that the Mexican people are an amalgamation of Indian, African, European AND Asian (Filipinos from the Spanish colony of the Philippines migrated to Mexico City), and autonomous mixed race (Indo-African) entities emerged all over the western hemisphere, including the Everglades of Florida and Virginia's Great Dismal Swamp. We live in an era when we reap the benefits of globalization while feeling the effects of a large groundswell of sentiment firmly aligned against these changes. But Mann's book makes a very convincing case that globalization has been taking place for half of a millennium and the resistance to it has existed for nearly as long. The book thus serves as an effective antidote for the historical parochialism with which we often find ourselves consumed."

52,0307265722,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24373332-jacques-coulardeau,4,"A NAIVE DREAM TURNED COVID-19It may occasionally take some time to discover a book, an idea, a theory. That was the case with Charles C. Mann. I had reservations on the first book, 1491 [Appendix A] and I have even more with the second. The first problem is the fact that, like the first book, this second book is collecting information from various sources that are duly identified – no plagiarism or theft of intellectual property at stake here – but besides this collecting of data, there is not much. First, the value of the various sources is not really assessed in any contradictory and objective way. He sets side by side different interpretations of events from different points of view, at times contradictory, but he does not go beyond this confrontation. He accumulates theses and antitheses but he never gets to any synthesis because he does not assess the truth-value of the various points of view, and when his text seems to be leaning one way rather than another it is only an illusion, an impression you get, a feeling in no way supported by some scientific valuation. Second, the only personal work of the author is the presentation itself, the presentation of his collected data in order to support – in no way prove – his a-priori hypothesis that is entirely condensed, contained and confined in the subtitle of the book, exactly 13 words, the fatidic number thirteen which, along with 20, is one of the numerical bases of the Maya mythology and their calendars. And a naïve Frenchman would add that this thirteen is contained in the title itself in French: “quatorze cent quatre-vingt-TREIZE.” And actually, 20 is there too in the surviving vigesimal counting system of the French with “QUATRE-VINGT” that should carry an “S” but does not because it is followed by “treize.” What I have just done here is what Mann does all along in his book. Putting data on his desk and considering that, as soon as this data is there, he only has to arrange it in the flat space of his desk or desktop for it to become a theory, a real scientifically historical truth. In other words, his accumulative presentation of different, even contradictory data is for him the post-modernism he wants to wrap himself in, and he forgets the essential third element: 1- Collect all data you can find because there is no truth, or all is true – which is an oxymoron since truth rejects everything that is not true, so all cannot be true. 2- Build up the contradictions among the various points of view, because there are only different points of view that are, according to the first principle, all and any one of them as true as any and every other one of them. 3- Postmodernism states that if there is maybe the beginning of something true it has to be built upon all the differences the data contain without negating or rejecting one single one of them all. In other words the author gives us a bipolar (the medical meaning can be included in this term that I use with the simple meaning of “binary method that cuts every single vision or observation into two contradictory and antagonistic elements,” and we will come later to the etymological meaning of “bipolar” as opposed to “multipolar”) thinking dividing the world in systematic dual oppositions of As and Bs, but it never provides the beginning of a ternary vision that states the necessary synthesis that does not negate the thesis and the antithesis but brings them together in some kind of unity that has to be constantly modified because everything changes in this world, all the data is moving and the synthesis has no permanence, no stability, is nothing but a constantly moving process that constantly aims higher, targets farther and tries to reach a deeper truth that has evaded everyone so far, and this new deeper synthesis will not negate A and B. It will transcend A and B by bringing them together. Let me be clear here. I defend a materialistic Hegelianism as opposed to both traditional idealistic Hegelianism and materialistic Marxism. I here work on an enormous reality in this world, and in this book, western thinking simply ignores, meaning does not want to take into account, Buddhism and its three principles: 1- Anicca, everything changes constantly; 2- Dukkha, we are always misfitted to that changing reality and we have to constantly adapt, adjust our behavior or way of thinking; 3- Anatta, which is the result of these very first two principles, there is no stable essence of anything, no stable self, no stable mind, no divine – which would be unchanging – soul. The truth – if there is any truth in Buddhism – is in this absolute impermanence, in the fact life is nothing but a process, and in the reality that we have to constantly adapt our behaviors, our views, our beliefs to this impermanent material, psychological, mental reality, this everchanging reality. And that’s the task of the mind, this human construct which is never finished, completed, achieved in any way, and always has to reformat itself as soon as a new batch of data comes into view of this mind. That’s what Buddhist meditation is all about. After having said this, I must admit that the author is totally ignorant of Buddhism, or Confucianism, or Taoism. Anyway, he would not integrate these oriental philosophies to change his way of thinking because, as he defines himself in the Prologue, he is “a reporter to the news division of the journal Science.” (page xx) That’s the answer he would level at what I am going to say: he is nothing but a journalist, not a scientist, so he cannot in any way build or construct a theory and he cannot judge, assess, or simply deem as more or less true or false any theory at all, any view at all he encounters and brings up in his writing. In other words, he is not responsible for what is written in the book. He is not a historian or a physicist, a physician, or a mathematician. So all he says, and first of all his a priori hypothesis in the subtitle of the book, is nothing but a hypothesis because he pretended it were a theory he would have to respect and follow a complicated methodology that he does not follow nor respect. He should take into account absolutely all available data. His ignorance of oriental thinking is probably the worst challenge to his hypothesis, the worst frustrating void in this hypothesis.He should assess the value of every single source he uses, refers to, brings up. He cannot satisfy himself with lining them up, as some sort of gallery of statues in a mental museum. He cannot repetitively use what Adam Smith wrote in the second half of the 18th century to analyze and assess data and facts that occurred in the 15th, 16th, and 17th centuries. Obviously, Raleigh, Cortés, or any other adventurer or conquistador could not know what Adam Smith was supposed to thinkl and write three centuries later. We in our modern times can use the concept of Adam Smith or anyone we want to analyze the past and build what we want to think about it, but we cannot use these concepts to confront people of the past who then are more or less rejected as ignorant, incompetent, uncultured, and some might even say idiotic. This anachronic use of historically dated concepts to evaluate people who lived long before the historical validation of these concepts is definitely to be criticized, as being extremely arrogant (we will develop this reference to Adam Smith when dealing with slavery). Thus he should constantly present a continuum from total trust to total distrust, and position all the views he presents somewhere on this continuum between trustworthy and untrustworthy, objective and subjective, unbiased and biased (and do not forget implicit bias), and always in the time concerned by the facts and events considered, hence in the minds of the people living in that time. This is becoming a trendy bigotry in today’s world: to judge, deem and assess peoples and actions of the past within the modern definition we have of human rights, justice, democracy, liberty, etc. We seem to forget that all the “rights” we may have today are the result of a slow and long emergence. THEY EXIST TODAY BECAUSE THEY DID NOT EXIST YESTERDAY OR IN THE PAST. And it is also common to judge deem and assess any foreign entity within the rights and liberties we have in our own country. This way of thinking, behaving, acting is purely umbilical, self-centered, egotistic. It is not because I am right-handed that everyone should be righthanded. It is not because I can speak three languages and read about half a dozen, that everyone should be able to speak the same three languages and read the same half a dozen. We are all capable to learn something new every day, but we are not all capable to learn the same things and the same amount of knowledge every day. WE ARE ALL EQUAL BECAUSE WE ARE ALL DIFFERENT. I am afraid Charles C. Mann has an implicit homogenizing conception of the world and globalization. That would lead us to the third moment in this methodology: the confrontation of all points of view in order to falsify or verify their truth-value, to prove or disprove their veracity, to support or reject what is being considered in these points of view. And such confrontation has to respect some standard rules of evaluation, and yet not be afraid of rejecting this or that standard rule, but it has to be justified methodologically, scientifically. Rejecting this or that idea, this or that method, because “some me, myself and I” thinks or believes it is justified, is not objective, not even acceptable. And any rule can be seen as valid only within some clear limits, and it is non-valid outside these limits. Two rules about the same phenomenon but with different validity bases should be brought together by integrating the two validity bases, but that’s not always simple. Is light some photons going from one emitting point A to one receiving point B? It is obviously true. But is light some photons advancing on a sinusoidal wave and not on a straight line? We also know it is true. We can easily bring the two together and yet in some cases the light will behave as if it were some photons advancing on a straight line and in some situations it will have to be seen, as some photons advancing on a sinusoidal wave. 1- We have total freedom of speech. 2- So, we have the right to say Black people animals. 3- But do we have the right to put these people in slavery because we think they are animals? 1- We have total freedom of expression. 2- So, we have the right to say Black people are just as human as we are. 3- So, do we have the right – and duty? – to provide them with the same level of comfort, education, healthcare, etc. we have, or do we have the right to let and encourage them to get – or take? – the same level of comfort we have?How can we bring these two points of view together in a reasonable and sustainable synthesis? Is it possible to synthesize them? Once I had to explain to a school inspector why I had given the students the assignment to prepare the arguments FOR and AGAINST racism for the next class. He was saying: “There are no arguments for racism which is unacceptable, and you should not even dream of planting such ideas in the heads of some students that there might be arguments for racism.” I just told him: “One-third of the class is from the Maghreb. They know all the arguments FOR racism because they are the victims of them.” And true enough with these students it is more difficult to make them find rich arguments against racism because one always knows better what one is the victim of than what one never experiences.But this absence of scientific methodology leads him to an a priori immodest and arrogant introductory conclusion that wants to appear humble: “My excuse is that the subject is too big for any single work.” (page xxiv) I could not agree more, or less actually. Then, take only one part of the subject and do it properly, keeping the other parts for later. There is nothing more frustrating than a compilation that becomes unreadable with an enormous text of more than 500 pages. Plus 66 pages of notes in a font size that is half that of the main text, and thus represents 132 pages with the standard font size of the book. With 521 notes in these 66-132 pages. Not to speak of an enormous bibliography though the 26-page index is not really helpful to get a bird’s eye’s view of the book. The author has forgotten that “he or she who embraces too many people cannot give anyone a real hug.” He also forgot that a reader is not a gargantuan consumer of pages. If the author had tried to just give a two-page summary at the beginning of each chapter he would have realized how his compilation of points of view is in no way logical as a demonstration of conclusions that are not anyway and always very clear.Dr. Jacques COULARDEAU"

We read this book as a selection in an Environmental Book Discussion Group my husband and I attend monthly. I was particularly struck by the economic downstream consequences that resulted from Columbus's voyage and the aftermath. "
54,0307265722,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3330916-jack,4,"In 1491, Charles Mann countered the western perception that Europeans discovered in the new world a pristine and largely vacant wilderness by illuminating what history now reveals: a landscape home to millions of people with sophisticated technologies, advanced agricultural practices, highly developed cultures, rich architecture and scientific knowledge. Through an avalanche of research and analysis he effectively concludes the pre-Columbian Americas afforded its peoples an overall quality of life that exceeded that of Europe. Full of new revelations, this book significantly altered the way I think about the societies that flourished here. The follow-up, 1493, continues this tradition by presenting the global aftermath of Columbus' accidental discovery of the new world, which Mann argues is one of the most significant events in human history. To make his point, Mann profiles several profound and significant ""agents of the Columbian exchange,"" - the people, places, raw materials, plants, animals and diseases that shaped a world suddenly reconnected for the first time since tectonic plates ripped apart the continents 200 million years ago. Globalization is a term associated with the 1980s and 90s, but its first act had a much more profound and spectacular impact. Mann describes divergent worlds that found themselves standing beside one another and intermixing with unknown and enormous consequences. This was an era when the world changed overnight, over and over again, which makes for a fascinating read.Like 1491, this book pieces together blurry and incoherent scraps of history into a vivid, richly illustrated narrative that provide a small and mesmerizing glimpse into the souls swept up by the Columbian Exchange. In doing so, it challenges popular perceptions of the new world - shifting credit from kings and queens to malaria, potatoes, and fruit.Mann looks at history and the world through a giant lens, but is able to focus on and weave together fascinating examples that illustrate the profound and otherwise forgotten moments that dramatically altered human life.--------------------------A few crazy byproducts of the Columbian Exchange that struck me while reading (best discovered in the book and not this list but here for my own recollection):- New studies suggest the Little Ice Age that plagued Europe resulted from the lack of controlled burns by Indians in North America upon European arrival. By allowing thousands of acres of forests to regenerate, the release of carbon was reduced resulting in a man-made global cooling effect that dropped temperatures worldwide.- The first true global economy took hold in current-day Mexico City, which became the center of commerce for precious medals, silk, tobacco, slaves and all sorts of plants and foods.- Tobacco: the first worldwide pop sensation. Nobody needed it, but everyone had to have it.- Malaria and yellow fever drove the African slave trade because Africans fared much better against the viruses than Europeans and Indians (yellow fever, it should be noted, is a really really bad way to go).- Europeans imported the ""English fly,"" or European honeybee to North America for honey, well before anyone realized the role bees play in pollination.- Potatoes, the staple of Ireland that lifted much of Europe from famine (and once disease hit, back into it), actually originate from the Andes.- The reintroduction of the earthworm to the upper regions of the United States for the first time since the glaciers wiped them out.- The insane harvesting of rubber and its role in the industrial revolution.- The South American city of Potosi, then the wealthiest place on earth, where thousands of enslaved Indians with candles strapped to their foreheads worked endlessly inside poorly ventilated ore mines.- The long-running success of ""maroons,"" in creating large populations, possibly ""discovering"" the Pacific, and negotiating with emerging governments."
55,0307265722,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23417467-rick-presley,4,"I was deeply and thoroughly impressed with Mann's monumental tome. It was every bit, if not more, sweeping in its treatment of the New World as his previous book 1491 documenting what we know about pre-Columbian America. Coupled with Ian Morris's book on ""Why the West Rules - For Now"" https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9... this promotes a far more egalitarian look at history, offsetting much of the Euro-centric conventional wisdom that passes for history in today’s schools. I may not agree that “those who win get to write the history books,” but for far too long, the winners have overwhelmingly dominated the conversation. 1493 is a nice corrective. A number of other reviewers express disappointment in the book for a variety of reasons and if I could summarize them, it would be due to this book failing to live up to their expectations. From my perspective, I question whether those expectations are warranted or not. Mann covers a broad sweep beginning with biology and moving into sociology and ultimately politics. What he has done is to fuse that which in my previous experience has been treated wholly separately. As a biology major, I remember time and again studying about invasive or exotic species and their impact on agriculture. Rarely did I hear about the benefits, either socially or ecologically, of the imports. As one example, I never knew that earthworms were introduced to North America, but I have known since my earliest childhood of how important they were to gardening. This was a startling revelation to me. Not only did I have no idea that something so profound is a result of the Columbian Exchange, but how it could be so universally unknown among my peers. This historical tidbit helps explain how thousands of years of indigenous forest management using fire was effectively replaced by forest management using earthworms and what an impact that had on ecology. And that is just one tiny little organism. I have known that Great Lakes fisheries survive today based on management of introduced species like the Coho and Chinook salmon while unintended immigrants like the Asian carp and zebra mussel are greeted with fear, despair, and antipathy. While I recognize the problems associated with introduced organisms, I have a lot of confidence in nature’s ability to sort things out. Over time. Mostly. Mann helps illustrate the pros and cons of an Exchange that continues to this day and shows no sign of letting up.Where Mann excels is tying these ecologic stories to a broader ecosystem that embraces human society. He moves smoothly from agriculture and nature to society and it’s give-and-take within the ecology it both finds and disrupts. From there he moves through politics and history, not quite, but nearly re-writing the Euro-centric view of the New World. If nothing else, he deserves accolades for looking at the data and writing about the massive shifts in human demography that took place as a result of the Columbian Exchange. I highly recommend this book as a must-read for anyone who wants to approach history from an incredibly broad perspective that encompasses everything from nature to politics. For someone who wants a “new perspective” on the history of the New World and its global impact, this is a great place to start. Mann points out that the Columbian Exchange is, above all, a genuine EXCHANGE. The roads all run both ways in this book and that is a refreshing interpretation in today’s academic climate. "
56,0307265722,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6314396-scott-smith,5,"This was a fascinating work of synthesis, wherein Mann draws on a variety of current scholarly sources to chronicle the genesis of globalization after 1492 and the forces unleashed by it, both constructive and destructive. He examines the impact of the spread of different microbes, animals, insects, foodstuffs, and ultimately, people, into and out of the Western Hemisphere, and how it transformed ecologies and economies. Some examples: he shows how the spread of maize and sweet potatoes from the Americas into China resulted in the ecological destruction of much of China, primarily due to deforestation, erosion, and exhaustion of land fertility from the 1500s even unto the present day; the spread of Africans into the Americas and the plight of slaves and creation of communities of escaped slaves (""Maroons""), and the legacy of these communities forming a permanent underclass of the dispossessed in Brazil and elsewhere. He shows the spread of the potato and also the spread of the potato blight and the Colorado potato beetle. They say that history is written by the victors, but this is history from the other side. Even more admirable is how he brings the history forth into the present time, showing how the extractive and exploitative actions of governments and corporations, continue to exploit the dispossessed, to ruinous effect. Mankind still seems prone to the same kind of selfish barbarities that have inflicted untold suffering over the centuries. No armchair scholar is Mann - he writes of his trips to China, Brazil, Mexico, and the Philippines and his interviews of native scholars, officials, and peasants, together with his visits to the actual sites. One of my favorite lines describes the inequality of a Laotian village elder (who is 30 years old), in negotiating a contract with a large Chinese company for rubber tree production - that the contract showed that 'one side had lawyers to maximize its contractual rights, and the other side didn't know what a lawyer was.' Mann's writing style is engaging and erudite. He maintains a certain sense of humor throughout the book. His footnotes and list of sources is extensive, comprising perhaps the last 20% of the book. Over the years, my tastes have become somewhat jaded, so I am drawn to and prize originality. This is a very original work of a vast scope - the exploration of the Columbian Exchange and its legacy. It is much greater than the sum of its parts. I give it 5 stars for this."
57,0307265722,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1050198-linda,5,"I'm familiar with the phrase ""the Columbian Exchange"", but never spent much time working out all its nuances. Charles C. Mann takes up the topic in 1493. In a nutshell, the Exchange is the process through which the combination of old world and new world elements has interacted to form the global culture of today. Mann, not a historian himself, synthesizes a generation's worth of research and literature into a lively, readable exposition on the political, cultural, and biological forces that were unleashed. Most such chronicles focus upon technology as the driving force in economic and social development. The Europeans, for instance, had superior weaponry and therefore easily conquered the New World's indigenous peoples. But Mann argues that biological forces were much more influential in determining outcomes.  Opening with the first prolonged contact between cultures along the Atlantic coast, Mann describes how micro-organisms from the Europe, Asia, and Africa hitched free passage to the Americas, causing a myriad of problems that could not have been foreseen and were poorly understood at that time. The colonies nearly failed until a profitable commodity crop, tobacco, was established. It was a micro-organism that enabled an American victory in the war for independence, and other micro-organisms fostered the enslavement of Africans in many countries. Mann then moves on to the Pacific, where he looks at silver, corn, and piracy, and their effects on both sides of that vast ocean. His discussion of the food that enabled China's population growth is particularly fascinating. Finally, he moves on to Europe and Africa, and provides an overview of the economy underlying the slave trade from the African point of view. Many men who were sold into slavery were prisoners of war, soldiers with military training, who put that experience to good use fomenting successful rebellions in Central America. It's daunting to review a book of this size and scope, so rich in facts and detail. But it's not dry detail. There were streets in South America, for example, that really were paved, not in gold, but silver. Europeans ""drank"" tobacco, and had elaborate rules and rituals surrounding the practice. And that the influence of the lowly sweet potato has been enormous. 1493 is not a polemic or a sales pitch. It is a thoughtful, fair, and balanced tour de force with the power to change how we view the world."
58,0307265722,http://goodreads.com/user/show/180214-ob-jonny,5,"This may be the most interesting non-fiction book I have ever read. This is the sequel to 1491 which was a history of the Western Hemisphere before Columbus. 1493 is a detailed history of what happened right afterward and how the world was changed by the ""Columbian Exchange"" or the restoration of Pangaea. It is amazing how different the world is today because of the exchange of people, animals, plants and diseases. Before the Columbian Exchange there was no tomato, potato, pepper, or rubber anywhere in the Eastern Hemisphere. The industrial revolution would not have been possible without rubber. By 1800 most of the Europe and Asia were living off of the potato and it allowed the world population to double just based on the new food that could be grown. Potatoes are less vulnerable to blight or bad weather which reduces the chance of famine. The book goes through the detailed stories of the first conquistadors: Columbus, Balboa, De Soto, Cortez, Pizarro. It's fascinating to know how human they were and the mistakes they made but also the amazing will power they had. There are so many fascinating stories that you would never read about in a history book about all of the strange things. There are lots of fascinating stories about a black guy who was a freed man from Spain who established the very first church in Mexico in around 1520 and the Western Hemisphere, and also planted the first grains which was the original ancestor of all of the wheat grown in most of north and south America. From 3 grains gave birth all of that wheat which is why it is so genetically homogeneous and susceptible to blight and pests. The same is true for the potatoes taken to Europe and Asia, they all came from the same few potatoes which means that when a bacteria likes that potato then it likes all of them. Also, there was a different black guy named Esteban who was part of an expedition of 500 who came to the Caribbean in the early 1500s. Due to shipwreck, disease, starvation, and skirmishes with injuns, pretty soon there were 4 left and these guys just wandered naked through the southeast US from Florida to Texas. Esteban became some kind of faith healer and the indians started to revere him as some kind of saint or spiritual man. Lots of great stories like that."
59,0307265722,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3948872-laura,4,"In 1972, historian Alfred W. Crosby Jr. published a book called “The Columbian Exchange.” If I understand correctly, it attempted to map the impact of the world-wide trade routes that arose after Columbus sailed the ocean blue. Mann reports he bugged Crosby to update the book so many times that Crosby finally snapped at him “you do it.” 1493 is that update. It tells the tale of the world’s transformation into one integrated financial, cultural, and biological system. The general shape of the story is well known. Mann fleshes out a lot of details. Brutally summarized, it comes down to “it was worse than I knew and faster.” Among other things, I learned:•	Scotland finally joined the United Kingdom after England agreed to pay Scottish debts related to a failed colony in Panama.•	Many British investors in Jamestown believed it was only a few days march from the Pacific and were quite peeved the colonists hadn’t gotten there so they could get on with the serious business of trading with China.•	Sir Francis Drake led a raid on a Spanish mule train carrying silver that would have been terribly successful except for one drunk French guy. •	But for malaria, the North likely would have won the Civil War so fast that there would not have been the political will for the Emancipation Proclamation or the 14th Amendment.•	17th Century Chinese tax policy led directly to massive deforestation and loss of top soil despite royal decrees that would have stopped the land management systems that wrecked so much havoc.•	An African princess and general, sold to Portuguese slavers, escaped and founded a military settlement in Brazil that controlled a large area of the coastal mountains for decades. •	Cortes fathered children on several of Moctezuma’s daughters. He also successfully petitioned the pope to legitimate a child he fathered on his interpreter. •	Pizarro fathered several children on different Inca princesses. One married his brother. The book is sprawling and occasionally self-indulgent but utterly engrossing. Well worth the time. "
60,0307265722,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2540803-ellen,4,"This is a good, thick book that will take a while to read. Every once in a while, you will probably want to do what I did and put it down and think about what you've just read and perhaps do some fact checking. I was particularly interested because Mann talks quite a bit about the importance of Fujian province in China and the incredible trade that sprung up there. He uses Fuzhou and neighboring ports to illustrate the first global trade cities - by 1340, Zaytun in Fujian province had seven mosques, three churches and a cathedral as well as the usual Buddhist institutions. Having been to Fujian province this year, I enjoyed learning more about its history. As Mann discusses the history of world trade, he also talks about the unintended consequences of that trade - the freeloaders that came on ships to change the ""new"" world forever - these were insects, illnesses and plant life. While we Westerners may be used to thinking of the English as destroying indigenous peoples with diseases and being new crops, we may not often think of them as changing the lives of those people forever by their farming methods. Indians traditionally burned land to clear it. This encouraged the growth of trees and shrubs whose seeds only opened when fired such as loblolly, long leaf and slash pines. As English methods of planting by chopping down trees and plowing land increased, trees such as oak and hickory filled in the forests and this may have impacted the amount of carbon dioxide in the air - today's climate change in reverse. Just one example of the information in this book to think about and fact check. Fascinating!"
61,0307265722,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11228-suman,3,"The premise of this book is interesting: globalization, contrary to being a recent phenomenon, has been occurring since the time of Christopher Columbus. The method of argument is unique, using biological and ecological explanations, rather than the standard political ones. And the sheer number of counter-intuitive facts is simply astounding. Did you know that the potato, which now spans much of Europe, originated from the Andes, and that Peruvian guano was exported to Europe to be used as its fertilizer? Or that African slaves, who outnumbered Europeans in the Americas until the late 1800s, possibly proliferated because they were more resistant to strains of malaria that decimated the white and ""Indian"" populations? Or that the earthworm was introduced to the US during the tobacco trade?The main problem with the book, however, is that it lacks focus. 1493 spans the mid-to-late 1400s to present time, Asia through Europe, has scattered observations about slavery, famine, and trade, and discusses so many different nations vying for wealth that it's hard to keep everything straight. Admittedly, history tends to be messy, but I was hoping for less meandering by Charles Mann. I have read that his earlier book, 1491, has this focus, and I would not hesitate to read that when I'm up for history-reading again."
62,0307265722,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11291586-ms-przybylski,4,"A person of average-or-better intelligence probably knows, on some level, that our world fundamentally changed in and/or shortly after 1492, how often do we really sit and contemplate those changes? This book is 500 some-odd pages of that contemplation (and I mean that as a compliment). I dove into this book head-first after reading 1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus. I'll be honest: I liked 1491 better. However, I'll be honest again: It's probably because of my own interests and biases. In 1491, Mann focuses (mostly) on what the Americas, while the geographical scope in 1493 is much broader. I've been on an Indigenous history kick lately, so 1491 was an easier, more satisfying read. That said...I'm glad I took the time to work through this book. Even if, as mentioned previously, I understood on some level how much our world changed in 1492, I didn't have an appreciation for the multi-directionality of that change. If nothing else, by reading this book I've gained a deeper understanding (beyond the human migration element... exploration, slavery, immigration) of the degree to which the ""discovery"" of the Americas affected Europe/Asia/Africa."
63,0307265722,http://goodreads.com/user/show/201275-richard,4,"Fascinating and sprawling history - maybe a little too sprawling as many of the topics could easily be separated into their own books. The book traces the changes brought about by the Columbian Exchange - the mixing of culture, people, plants (domesticated and otherwise), livestock, and micro-organisms as a result of re-discovery of America. Mann tracks changes in world population growth rates brought on by new crops, the devastating spread of previously unheard of diseases in both directions, environmental changes due to the introduction new domesticated plants and animals as well as new farming techniques, and the changes to culture and migration. It's both an improvement and expansion of the Columbian Exchange by Alfred Crosby (though not entirely a replacement - that books's still worth reading as well). Mann does a great job in spreading beyond the Western Europe/Americas dichotomy, giving equal weight to the effects of the exchange between the Americas and Asia and the Americas and Africa. For me, the most interesting section was the history of maroon societies - settlements founded by escaped African slaves, Asian workers, and Native Americans throughout North, Central, and South America - which continue a present day influence.

65,0307265722,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5720805-tom-schulte,4,"This follow up to 1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus has more relevance and is arguably an important read to understand currently agricultural and even cultrual aspects of the ""homogecene"" era prompted by the Columbian Exchange. Resonating with Pollan's The Botany of Desire: A Plant's-Eye View of the World, Mann recounts the history of potatoes from Andean tuber to edible pesticide. Other amazing chapters of this microhistory is the Asian exchange with the galleon trade leading to a 16th Century Chinatown in Mexico City and Mexican silver en masse relocated to China.I particularly enjoyed and got a lot out of the theme that this late 15th Century activity started a wave of globalism that ramped up quickly and we still feel today. Two examples of that were ex-Confederate refugee rubber plantation founders in Sao Paulo, Brazile (http://www.patsabin.com/lowcountry/co...) and the failed Darien scheme of Scottish colonists in Panama."
66,0307265722,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13016368-dayamati-hayes,4,"The principal theme of the book is to chronicle the consequences of European exploration of Asia, Africa and the Americas. Using the arrival of Christopher Columbus in the Americas as symbolic of the beginning of what we now call globalization, the impacts on trade, on the environment, on culture and on politics are explored in some detail. Because the scope of the book is so vast, the author occasionally seems to have lost focus and to be meandering through a thicket of episodes in human history, but the journey is always a fascinating one, filled with surprises and thought-provoking hypotheses. Like Howard Zinn's A People's History of the United States, the book offers perspectives on history that are not commonly given. Whether one ends up agreeing with some of the claims—for example, that malaria ended up playing a key role in the fact that Americans of European descent preferred African slaves over the Indian slaves being sold by the Moskogean peoples, because West Africans were less likely to succumb to the disease—one will never be wanting for thought-provoking hypotheses. Readers willing to be gently jarred out of their customary ways of viewing history are likely to find the book delightful. Others may be slightly annoyed."
67,0307265722,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4131417-kirsten,5,"While I didn't enjoy this book as much as his last book (1491), I still think it was very thought provoking. This book is primarily focused on the Colombian Exchange. He first details out the usual North American ecological and human exchanges, then moves to South America. While talking about the Americas, he also talks a great deal about Asia and Africa at this time, because they were as important in the exchange as Europe and N. and S. America. I think he did a good job explaining such a complex topic, though the end of the book starts to feel rushed, like he had a lot more to say and not enough pages. This is probably only the last 20 pages or so, the rest is written at a much more measured (and detail packed) pace. It's a very dense read, nothing that can be skimmed, but he does provide a number of helpful maps, pictures, paintings, etc to illustrate what he's talking about, and makes a number of points that really make you pause and think.I would recommend this book to anyone who liked his last book (this is kind of a continuation), or anyone who is interested in ecology, geography, history, etc. It really has a little bit of something for everyone.

Presenting the latest research by biologists, anthropologists, archaeologists, and historians, Mann shows how the post-Columbian network of ecological and economic exchange fostered the rise of Europe, devastated imperial China, convulsed Africa, and for two centuries made Mexico City -- where Asia, Europe, and the new frontier of the Americas dynamically interacted -- the center of the world. In this history, Mann uncovers the germ of today's fiercest political disputes, from immigration to trade policy to culture wars. In 1493, Mann has again given readers an eye-opening scientific interpretation of our past, unequaled in its authority and fascination.""~~back coverThis is a very fascinating book -- not an easy read but certainly not so academic that the average reader can't understand and appreciate.

69,0307265722,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10505847-mary-soderstrom,3,"Charles Mann's 1491, about the world just before Columbus's voyage west, was an eye-opener. I found it very well written and seemingly extremely well-researched. In 1493, about what happened after 1492, the same level of research is evident, but the book is much less successful.I'm not sure my disappointment is due to the research I've done since I first read 1491. That was wehn I was beginning work on my own book about exploration and its effects, Making Waves: The Continuing Portuguese Adventure (Véhicule Books.) Mann cites many of the sources I went on to read and which I cite, so the surprise factor in 1943 is much less than in 1491 for me. The book deals extensively with the Columbian Exchange, that is, the way that plants and animals from the New World were brought to the Old World and vice versa. This global exchange is leading toward a homogenizing of the entire world, leading to what Mann calls the era of the Homogonocene. The idea is interesting, but I must admit I had trouble even pronouncing the word in my head which meant I had trouble absorbing the concept. "
70,0307265722,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1196849-mackay,4,"Been busy, so slow at reading this--but it's terrific, a sweeping history of everything. Or a sweeping history of how world-wide trade changed with the European discovery of the New World, and how trade drove, and drives, ecological and cultural changes, good and bad, in all the world.The subtitle is misleading; the eponymous year of the title is merely a handy jumping off point for when what has been called The Columbian Exchange began. The erudition and enlightening detail of this book is wonderful. Who knew the North American continent lacked earthworms until European settlers arrived? Who knew Spanish silver from its New World mines mattered most to ... China? Who knew the monoculture of rubber was so destructive to SE Asia, or that honeybees were known as ""English flies"" to the indigenous tribes of the Atlantic coast?It's a little like chaos theory meets Guns, Germs, and Steel; but Mann's research is deep and his arguments logical and well thought through."

I loved 1491, which I definitely count as a book that changed my perspective on the world. This sequel is more miscellaneous. Where 1491 had a clarion main idea--that pre-Columbian America was far more densely populated and richly sophisticated than we learned in school--the sequel charts repercussions of ""the Columbian Exchange"" more episodically. Some of the more worthwhile sections concern communities of escaped slaves in South America, yellow fever and malaria at different latitudes in the New World, and how the potato both fed Europe and doomed parts of it to famine due to a blight that was itself imported from the Americas. This book felt longer, more loosely held together, and less surprising. Not as good as the first one, but still worth a read."

What really happened to the 'native' populations after Cristoforo Colombo aka Cristóbal Colón rediscovered the 'New World'? Are we all really that different from one another? How did slaves and mosquitoes sculpt the history of North and South America? Was the allure And extraction of precious metals that romantic? The fascinating Columbian Exchange globalized the planet long before today's globalization. In history class we learned that things were mostly hunky-dory in North and South America. Little did we know and less were we taught. Many surprises bring somber thoughts and realizations.
73,0307265722,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12662225-darius,4,"This book explores all the ways in which people, vegetables, animals and disease that were confined to the eastern or western hemisphere for centuries spread across the world in what Mann calls ""the Columbian exchange"". The world became more homogeneous as a result, where many things people think of as their native customs, fruits, and foods were actually imports from a few generations ago. The process of this grand exchange has a lot of interesting stories and side-stories, and side-stories to those side-stories. Mann loves to takes us down a lot of by-ways, sometimes even within a single paragraph. This could be a distraction if one wants to stick to a simple theme, but the point of this book is to take in all the little tendrils that have tied the world into a single whole."

Mann is at his best discussing the impact of silver, sugar, rubber, tobacco, coffee, potatoes, and corn on the economies and ecosystems of entire civilizations. The sheer force of these commodities radically transformed land and people from China to Brazil and everywhere in between.I found Mann less interesting when he shifted from economics and ecology and into social history. While I can't fault him from trying, his attempts add a couple hundred pages to a book that would have been about as good without it."

While some threads were previously known (yellow fever), other threads were astonishingly new (China's silver based monetary system). But all threads gave me new and thrilling understanding of an era that seemed so ho-hum in history class. Asians in the New World, pirates, working conditions, collaboration between African slaves and Native Americans, plantation slavery model, spread of food as a way to improve life for the malnourished, are all covered. As with anything, the Columbian Exchange cannot be profiled as good or evil, but instead is a very complex subject that deserves sustained consideration."

Perhaps because it focuses more on the effects to Europe, Africa and China and the rest of Asia over those of the Americas, which is where my interest lies when it comes to this time. But when Mann does refocus on the Americas the book really takes off. The history of its people, and how they interacted with the Europeans and, especially, Africans, makes for some fascinating reading.The world created, to both the detriment and benefit to all the continents, is the one we’re still dealing with today, with all its devastation. And the pluses, too. Where would we all be without rubber? Or corn? Or the potato, which fed huge parts of Europe? But one does get the idea that the New World got the raw end of the deal."

So many things I didn't realize: the extent to which the native population of the Western Hemisphere was decimated by disease post 1542, the number of slaves imported into SOUTH America, the extent to which CHINA was changed by its interaction with Europe (and European exlorers/traders/settlers of the New World), the influence of malaria on the history of the hemisphere, how importation/exportation of plant life changed things, how quickly everyone got hooked on tobacco...the list goes on and on."

But wading through very, very long passages about the genetics of potatoes or the nature of elastomers to get to those all too brief gems is asking too much. Causal historians will be bored. Hard core historians will want much more detail – about specific things. Know-it-alls will be - well, maybe that group will love to cull trivia from the book. "

This book clears that fallacy and discusses the economics of trade, and how various goods (tobacco, potatoes, sweet potatoes, silver, slaves, etc) as well as disease (malaria, yellow fever) were exchanged.

The book starts off with a bang- chock full of great facts. Then, the author inputs personal anecdotes of his visits to some of these places, as well as a ridiculous flying metaphor. These devices were very distracting from the original narrative.Then, the book meanders pretty much through all known history. Too much information, too unfocused, and ultimately boring.

Coming off of “1491,” Mann does it again. “1493” is a perfect follow up, and it is just as well written, well told, and well structured. He weaves a story of trade and commerce over both the Atlantic and the Pacific, and how the continents—and countries—interacted with each other now that the Americas were in the picture. He brings up different points of view that made me think, and he shows new facts and details that should be—and should have been—told in classrooms.I definitely recommend this as a read."

Topics include everything from the potato famine to tobacco farming to both sides of slavery all over the world. Mann doesn't simply tell us when things happened. He tells us how and why. 1493 is well written, easy to follow and incredibly informative."

105,0307265722,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3030419-fraser-kinnear,4,"1493 is a history of what Mann calls the ""Columbian Exchange"", a term used to describe the global-scale of trade ushered in by Christopher Columbus when he discovered the New World. This Columbian Exchange stirred up ecologies and economies all over the world, as new plants, animals, and microbes were introduced, edging out the existing competition.Some of these radical changes included:- The introduction of European microbes to the Americas, which killed 3/4 of the entire population of the Americas, and lead to the destruction of several large empires, including the Inca and the Aztec Triple Alliance.- Potatoes were brought from the Americas to Europe, and allowed for an explosion in population across Northern Europe. Famines were common and regular prior to the potatoes arrival. Potatoes are ~4x more productive than wheat as measured by dry weight (water removed) of food produced per acre of farmland. Potatoes have all essential nutrients save vitamins A and D, which you can get from animal milk. - At the start of Ireland's potato famine, 4 in 10 Irish ate no solid food except potatoes. The famine was a cross-country apocalypse, reulting in a 20-25% drop in the population. It killed >1 million people, and 2-3 million fled the country. ""As late as the 1960's, its population was half as it had been in 1840"" and today it has a smaller population than 150 years ago (perhaps the only country where this is true)- Maize and sweet potatoes were brought to China, and allowed for agriculture to spread uphill from the existing rice-based farming. This exacerbated flooding in China thanks to mass deforestation and erosion and killed a lot of people / destabilized governments - Slavery in the Americas began as mostly white-on-white indentered servants. Between 1/2 and 1/3 of all European migrants in the first 100 years of the American colonies were indentured servants. But African-natives showed a markedly better survival rate against Malaria (which came from - In fact, the damage done by Malaria was a key driver in delaying the Union's victory in the US Civil war, as well as the British defeat in the US revolutionary war, and Napoleon's defeat in the Caribbean that catalyzed the Louisiana Purchase. - Prior to the dawn of the ""Galleon Trade"", China was not interested in trade with the rest of the world, because it was by almost every objective measure of economy, technology, and public health, the greatest country on earth. Spain however discovered enormous silver mines in recently colonized Peru at the same time that China was going through a currency crisis whereby they needed silver. A huge center of trade erupted in the Philippines whereby the Spaniards mined silver with slaves in Peru, sailed it to Manila where they exchanged it for silk and other Chinese goods, and returned those goods back to Spain where they were STILL CHEAPER than European cotton and wool products after enormous markups.- The amount of silver mined in the Americas in the late 1500's, and the rampant spending of the Spanish crown at the same time, destabilized the country and spread across Europe. The cost of living doubled in 50 years+, ushering in sweeping unrest and revolution- The Little Ice Age, which killed millions of people across the planet, overturning entire dynasties, like the Ming in China- Tobacco trade between Virginia and Europe involved sailing boats from England to VA that carried barrels filled with dirt (as ballast). Those barrels were then emptied in Virginia and replaced with tobacco. Worms did not exist in North America prior to this moment, but arrived in that dirt. They totally transformed the North American environment. Tobacco farming also decimated huge areas, as Tobacco sucks all of the nitrogen out of soil, and is not replaced (because the whole plant is removed for harvest)- Tobacco farming in Virginia was creating enormous returns (+1000% in a few years) for investors, but labor was difficult to come by. Churches were employed, and ministers evangelized adventure to the new world or co-invest- The european honeybee was also brought to the Americas and exploded in population. European agriculture in the Americas almost surely would not have succeeded without it, despite pollonization not being discovered until the 1800s (Europeans wanted the honey).- Zheng He led a Chinese armada in the 1400s that had >300 ships (>2x the size of the famous Spanish Armada) and sailed all the way to Africa. China soon after abandoned naval trade. Mann points to Chinese bureaucracy shutting it down after a failed attempt to control it. In fact, China retained a naval tradition, only among independent pirate states. Mann's descriptions of the pirate-states in Fujian during the Ming dynasty sounds absolutely fascinating. I suspect there are incredible adventure stories about those days. - The story of Brazil'srubber boom in the Amazon rainforest was also fascinating, and life in Belem and Manaus at the time sounds incredible. Rubber was a necessary material for the industrial revolution. The expansion of rubber agriculture across South East Asia has totally transformed the ecosystem out there. It's only a matter of time before a blight destroys these rubber crops, which will have huge global impact.- For every European who came to the Americas, 3 Africans made the trip (mostly due to the slave trade). Since there were already 10's of millions of people already in the Americas when Europeans and Africans arrived, most of the human interactions occurred between Africans and Indians. But their interactions are the least told story of the New World- Throughout much of West Africa during the period of the Columbian Exchange, governments were organized such that the royal families owned all of the land. The most valuable assets in those societies, therefore, became labor. As a result, slavery within Africa quite common. 17th century West Africa was very politically fragmented, and war commonly broke out that resulted in mass enslavement of the loser. Almost all of the slave trade that resulted between Europeans and Africans was in fact slaves purchased in Africa from an existing market.Also fascinating was Manila during the Galleon Trade (late 16th through early 18th century). The city was racially serrated, and the Chinese were forced into maze-like neighborhoods outside of the city proper. The Chinese were there to trade with the nervous Spaniards, who on a dozen different occasions sacked and razed the Chinese neighborhoods whenever fears over the balance of economic or political power bent too far in China's favor. Tens of thousands of Chinese were killed during these events, yet soon after regular trade returned. Other interesting stuff:- One theory as to why the state of China was so much more developed than anything in the west is that it was a hydraulic empire, which needed to organize much earlier in order to control rivers that frequently flooded so as to manage agriculture.- There is far more variety of potatoes than what we can normally get in the US. More than 3,700 varieties are documented.- Japanese samurai roamed the roads of Mexico, and were employed to keep the peace there / protect Spanish silver shipments from the Galleon trade. Many had gone to the Philippenes in 1603-1609 for work, and were not allowed back in Japan when the country decided to close off its borders to outsiders in the 1630s."
106,0307265722,http://goodreads.com/user/show/192703-alex,5,"An impartial, illuminating and entertaining voyage through history from the year after ""Colòn"" landed in Hispaniola to today. A necessary perspective and a fun ride.The obvious comparisons are Harari's ""Sapiens"", and ""Guns, Germs, and Steel"" by Diamond. Extra points to ""1493"" for timeliness. Mann has a light hand while digging deeeeep into the story of how we ended up here, now, with THIS system. We all know the main players, but maybe not as well as you might think. For one thing (call me ignorant) but I had no idea of how advanced were the Native civilizations in the New World. In many cases they had the upper hand over the Europeans, and not just because they knew the territory. They weren't just treading lightly through the vast forests, picking berries and shooting deer. The Natives had huge and intricate civilizations with agriculture and highly-developed social systems. On the other hand, the Europeans are usually cast as the big tough bad guys of the story, after all, they ""won"" and sadly the Native Americans were essentially exterminated, but here the Europeans get the ""Fortune's Fools"" treatment, bascially getting helplessly blown about the globe on a tempest of their own making. Mann gives you these perspectives without preaching. He serves you the story and you can draw your own conclusions.Still the meat of book isn't the potentially illuminating perspective on modern times, but the stories of history. Stuff like the endlessly fascinating history of ""The Potato in the World"", and the subsequent International Guano Crisis. Yeah, bird poop. For decades is was more valuable than gold, and for good reason within the economic system of the time. (Makes you wonder how ""fossil fuels"" will be laughed at centuries from now.) The story of how Spain began globalization in the early 1500's by meeting the Chinese on the shores of the Philippines while trading Mexican silver. The tragic and unusual history of slavery in the world. And if we think today's virus is bad (I do, of course), well, throughout history, almost up to present times, malaria and smallpox and yellow fever killed so many people, it makes your head spin. This review is really just skimming over the top of an excellent read. Highly recommended."
107,0307265722,http://goodreads.com/user/show/80247437-thomas,5,"I really enjoyed this one. I love those history books that take me on a vast, all-encompassing journey across space and time to see a big picture more clearly than I ever had before.Of course, most people are aware of how Columbus changed the course of human history when he bumbled his way into the Americas. Much has been made of the great exchange of crops and animals that altered the course of history as well. What I think that most people don’t fully grasp is the epic scale of the Columbian Exchange. It is not just historic in the human sense, it is historic in the geologic and natural sense. Much has been made of the Anthropocene, the period during which human activity has been the dominant influence on climate and the environment, but few have recognized that Columbus’s accidental discovery was the key moment that set it off.I’m not sure if Columbus, as a navigator and flawed visionary, deserves much credit for the epic transformation he touched off any more than a moron who tossed aside a lit cigarette and sets off a massive wildfire deserves any particular credit. The tides of history would’ve pushed the two separate worlds together at some point not far off from 1992, even if that Italian stumblebum had never been born.And so we have a wonderful chronicle here of all the cultural, economic, and biological impacts that gone to make the modern world since contact all encapsulated in a series of historic moments across the planet. Globalization has almost become a natural force beyond human control, like a hurricane or an erupting volcano. What a frightening and epic journey for all of us little people being blown along in its winds. Even the election of a series of populist politicians across the world who have exploited people’s fear and ignorance in a futile attempt to turn back the clock is really a symptom of the unstoppable whirlwind set off by Columbus.I could go on and on about all that I learned and enjoyed here but, I think, you should just read the book and take the journey yourself."

These books contain the true history of the world, written in an easy voice, making the truth easier to swallow for so many of us, I included, who were told an alternative version to the facts. Yes, it is an eye-opener. There are parts that will fascinate you, like the plight of the lowly potato, and parts that will disgust you, like realizing no one on the planet could possibly be immune to the tragedy of slavery. And, as the saying goes, 'It' doesn't affect you, until it Effects You. What fascinates me most, is how the truth is always revealed. Even if it is written in a book few will read, it's there for anyone to read. But the truth is sometimes scary, it could mean having your life changed in ways you never imagined. It could mean having no choice but to accept facts you've chosen to ignore. Or maybe you didn't know and your only excuse is now ignorance. Well, here's your chance to educate yourself to the truth.It took me a little over a year to read both these books, doing so for a few minutes each night before going to bed. I was able to pick these books up and read, remembering what I'd read the night or even the week before, as I continued on through passages of time I had not known existed. Wars, battles, kingdoms, colonies, and the lives of the people who lived and died in them kept me coming back to the end. Thank you, Charles C.

While 1491 focused on pre Columbus America, 1493 focuses on the many impacts that uniting the world through trade and discovery had. From the agricultural bounty of the Americas feeding and being responsible for population growth in Europe, to malaria and yellow fever decimating Native American and European alike, to silver flooding China and African maroon communities, globalization as we know it is has shaped our world for half a millennia. This book was absolutely fascinating in its breadth and detail, and how many things we assume to be culture- specific were really borrowed from elsewhere (e.g. tomatoes from America in Italian cooking). In a time when oceans of ink are split on the benefits and ills of globalization and whether it should continue (as if we could stop it), it's extremely interesting to learn the impacts that already happened and how they shape the world we know. Anyone and everyone should read this book. You'll learn something, you'll have to think, you'll be amazed at how integrated the world truly is."

Mann untangles many of the ecological and human consequences of the meeting of worlds and mixing of species and cultures that started with the establishment of an ongoing European presence in the Americas. For example -- Europeans overturned many Native American cultural practices in ways that made perfect breeding grounds for disease-carrying mosquitoes that were recently introduced from Africa. Africans were far more resistant to both malaria and yellow fever than were either Europeans or North Americans. This may have been one of the economic forces that caused the American south to be founded primarily on African chattel slavery rather than European indentured servitude. We see the potato go from America to Ireland and create a population boom, followed by the tragedy of the famine when the potato blight follows after. There are so many amazing stories here -- biology, warfare, economics, suffering, resistance. Highly recommended."

Europeans and natives alike, producing sugar and rum for export from the Caribbean, succumbed to epidemics of yellow fever. The demand for more and more rubber led to wars in the Amazon and to forest depletion and water depletion in Laos today. And mining fertilizer in the form of guano resulted in the most atrocious forms of slavery in Peru. Mann does not spare the painful details as to the damage wrought on individual people and on their societies. Yet sometimes it’s hard to evaluate the benefits against the harms. Transplanting the potato to Europe and the sweet potato to China created “catastrophic social and environmental problems,” Mann shows, yet he argues that these vegetables may well have prevented malnutrition. These are stories in which the law of unexpected consequences rules and we will certainly for centuries be living with those consequences."

I really enjoyed learning so much more about the globalization that happened immediately after Columbus landed in the Americas. I finally have my answer to the question of how Ireland came to rely on potatoes so heavily when potatoes when potatoes come from Peru, and thus didn't even exist in Europe before 1492-- seriously, I've wondered about that for years. And Mann's points that the rise of slavery had much to do with malaria were fascinating-- I had never heard anything about this. And I DEFINITELY had never heard of the ""maroon"" civilizations formed by runaway slaves all throughout north and south America... There was so much of interest throughout this book. I should probably go back and read Mann's 1491, now..."
113,0307265722,http://goodreads.com/user/show/504424-bup,2,"Wow but this dragged on. I wanted to learn about how the world was suddenly different after Columbus made the voyage to Hispaniola in 1492, and I did, but I didn't need to hear so much about so many crops for so long.It picked up in parts for me - latex/natural rubber being a new world cultivation was new to me (Incans had rubber balls which fascinated the Spaniards who first saw them), and the history of rubber, which includes that Goodyear never made the fortune he probably deserved and that the company was named for him but was not started by him, were interesting, and the more complex relationship between the Jamestown settlers and the Powhatan than one learns in high school history, but there were a lot of boring crops in between."
114,0307265722,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1751569-heather-wg,4,"This was a really good follow-up to his first book 1491. I provided a fascinating overview of some of the changes that were brought about because the Columbian exchange. I knew a fair amount of what Columbus’s discovery of America meant for colonial United States, the slave trade in Africa, and Great Britain. However I never thought about what it meant for China and the Philippines and much of Mexico or South America. It’s a very accessible history book that presents the clash or cultures and its consequence with plenty of nuance without being dense. "
115,0307265722,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18595670-jill,0,"Well, I read most of this book. When I started it, I thought we'd be reading the full thing for class, but five of nine chapters seems good enough for me. I remember Ms. Bourassa either really loving or really hating this book, so I'm glad to have read it. This isn't meant to be a history textbook, so I understand where he's coming from, but he often makes broad generalizations that are sometimes unfounded, given that he does not cite most of his sources. I liked it more than my friends did, but I'm not sure I'd read the rest of the chapters unless I was pretty bored."
116,0307265722,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2225001-tom,5,"My high school friend Terri recommended this book. Mann's main point is that Colombus did not discover the New World; rather he created it by starting a world wide globalization of trade. Imagine Ireland without potatoes or Italy without tomatoes. Mann links the introduction of mosquitoes to North America with the rise of slavery. Like 'Guns, Germs, and Steel,' '1493' is full of a-ha moments, in which the author gets your synapses firing. "
117,0307265722,http://goodreads.com/user/show/77616236-rh-michetti,2,I so loved 1491 but this book was disappointing. The book is harder to read and some of the theories do not seem to be backed up with sources. The author also jumps around too much. It almost felt like this was written by a different author from 1491. 
118,0307265722,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52133336-hannah-edinburgh,4,"Rounded up from 3.5 stars. I learned some really interesting things and a lot about both Spanish and British colonialism, but it was kind of sprawling and unfocused at times"
119,0307265722,http://goodreads.com/user/show/74031303-trevor-hoffman,4,The most engrossing history I've ever read. Fascinating exploration of the trickle down consequences of Columbus' arrival to the New World.
