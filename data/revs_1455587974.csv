It was an interesting book that added basically no new information to the pantheon.If you don't have time to read this book, here is the TLDR:Don’t be a caregiverBe WhiteDon’t be poorExercise at least 3x a weekEat Fruits/VeggiesDon’t SmokeBe thin (at least don’t have belly fat)Don't eat so much sugar.That’s the whole book. #yourewelcome. If you haven't read any diet or health books in the last decade you might learn something but if you already know you should exercise and eat veggies, you're all set.And if you happen to be a non-white caregiver that is poor, overweight and smokes…you’re fooked."

I feel like yeah maybe I should have anticipated it somewhat from the title and branding but it also feels disingenuous to it say it's by the Nobel prize winning biologist. Or even to list that biologist first when listing the authors. I also feel like it's quite pathetic how bad a job this book does at justifying why one should aim to have longer telomeres as a goal. Like just a while ago I read Lifespan by David Sinclair and then complained how it wasn't focusing enough on the science and this was just so much worse. The author mentions confounding variables at a point, but seems to neglect the fact that longer telomeres being correlated or useful for predicting certain good health outcomes doesn't indict a casual relationship. There's like zero effort even made to at least offer up a plausible theory of the underlying dynamics that cause shorter telomeres to lead to the signs of again. At least Sinclair proposed a clear theory for aging and then made a cohesive argument for it.This felt like an attempt to repackage advice, much of which is evidence based, in some unified fashion by making nebulous links to their correlation to longer telomeres, but without any justification for why it should matter that that link exists. It feels like an exercise in branding to create some wellness program with the veneer of science but without doing the work of creating any explanations for why things work a certain way. Also she named drop Deepak Chopra and that's just going to be a hard no from me.All I wanted was a book about science and instead I got some god damn therapy, and if I had wanted therapy, I wouldn't have stopped going to therapy. I want to be like someone please teach psychologists how statistics work, but there was enough hedging in the book that makes me feel like she knows the limitations of the studies and science, which makes it feel like this is an attempt to build a brand (and sell book) more than an attempt to do science education about the current state of telomere research."
2,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,3,"The new field of telomere research is fascinating. Telomeres obviously have a big effect on our lives and on our aging. Elizabeth Blackburn is a co-discoverer of telomerase, an enzyme that helps to replenish telomeres. For this discovery, she won the Nobel Prize in physiology. She well deserves that prize.I generally enjoy reading science books when the author is a researcher in the field. And, since Elizabeth Blackburn is a leading scientist in the field of telomeres, I thought this would be a superb book. It is a very good book, but I did not care much for its self-help aspects. Some research has shown that chronic stress helps to decrease the length of telomeres, leading to more rapid aging. This book makes a big, big deal out of this finding. The book presents quizzes to the reader, to help determine the role of stress in one's life. There is lots of advice given, about how to cope and manage stress.Nevertheless, this is a very controversial area. For example, the metastudy about perceived stress and telomere length found that the correlation, while statistically significant, is very small. So, one of the major themes in the book is very much a questionable hypothesis. The book comes off feeling more like a self-help book--recommending all the lifestyle changes that you can read about in many other places--instead of a comprehensive look at the scientific field of telomere and telomerase research. Frankly, much of the book bored me."

I was SO excited to read Dr Blackburn's book since I have been out of the field for a decade. As a scientist, I found it much like reading a very long review. I found myself wondering if in trying too hard to make it accessible, it just got very dry. This is an interesting field and the research has the potential or creating new treatments for a wide variety of problems. Even as someone who knows the science well and is interested in the field, it was rough. The title says ""The New Science of Living Younger, "" but I felt like it just rehashed the science that most people know. Sleep well, eat well, exercise, reduce stress and environmental toxins. I was disappointed.Full disclosure - I received a copy of the book from Netgalley in exchange for an honest review."

Now, I went into this with a basic understanding of telomeres. They're nonsense code at the end of your chromosome, a cap to protect your cell during mitosis/meiosis. And they can wear down, which isn't a good thing. I learned that in my general biology course that I took a year ago. We spent, maybe, ten minutes on the topic, then moved on. I can't even remember if I was tested on them.The authors of this book do an incredible job of dumbing down very difficult scientific information for someone like me. It's presented in a very easy to understand way. From even talking about telomeres to all of the complex subjects of this book. Mental health, trauma, diet, exercise. It's all presented in a succinct fashion so you get at the heart of the research that shows and doesn't show something. I always love it when authors choose to put in studies that contrast other findings, and they did it in this book.Not only that, but there are tons of exercises in this book. Want a quiz to talk about what areas in your life you need to work on for telomere health? They're all in here and more. Not only that, but they tell you what survey/questionnaire they adapted it from, and whether you can find it for free online or not. So, they give you so much information, along with stating that by the time this book gets published, a good portion of the information would need to be tweaked. For that, they provide a website to keep updated on new studies that come out.Impressive, right? I was pretty damn impressed.One of the authors is a biologist, so you get one side of things. The other is a psychologist. Now, I could get more into the psychology side of things. (Psych major. Duh.) And practically everything that they presented in this book, I actually learned in a psychology class. Enter me spring 2016 term, taking a class called health psychology. We talked about diet, exercise, various mental diseases, childhood trauma. Man, I even researched mindfulness, cognitive-behavioral therapies, yoga, and meditation for a project in this class, something they spend a chapter on in the book. Basically, this was my bread and butter. I'm actually planning on emailing my professor to tell her about this book because she'd probably really enjoy it.The only thing that I didn't like was how repetitive it got towards the end. And how sometimes what they were telling me to do didn't always seem to relate back to telomeres. At times I had to make the jump in my head that doing X leads to short telomeres. And then Y was presented as something to stop X... and therefore may help telomere length. Not all of them were large stretches, but some were. And, I would really only suggest this book to someone interested in this very abstract area or you have knowledge on it already. I'm not sure if I can see this becoming a popular book, but I could be wrong.Either way, it was very enjoyable and I'm glad that I read it!"

And by the way: drink clean water, eat organic fruits and vegetables; stay away from processed foods; develop a loving close-knit social network. All of these things will improve your telomeres which are those little things at the end of your DNA strands that look like the plastic piece at the end of your shoelaces which keep your shoelaces from unraveling. "
6,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21502628-susan,5,"This is a fascinating look at why all those things you know are good for you actually are good for you: A healthy diet, positive attitude, exercise, good stress management, rewarding friendships and life goals. It is no surprise to see these things recommended but I never knew the exact mechanism by which these elements help us live long and healthy lives. We all know we should avoid stress, isolation, processed foods, smoking and pesticides, and a sedentary lifestyle. This book beaks it down to a cellular level and links all of these factors to telomere length/damage which is then lined to early onset of aging, disease and even death. There are some really great, easy to follow tips to support your telomeres and be healthier in general. I was pretty shocked by how effective meditation is in keeping your telomeres healthy. I’ve always kind of rolled my eyes at meditation but now ’m going to have to seriously look into doing it because the effects are profound. This isn’t just some new age hokum. There is real science to back it up!Several years ago I contracted Lyme disease. At the time I was a graduate student and under a ton of stress. Instead of fighting it off like it was the flu and moving on as most people do, in me it was much more serious and caused my brain to swell. I’ve always connected the fact that I was under intense stress with the severity of my illness but I never understood the exact mechanism. Now I can see that that period of high stress caused havoc on my telomeres and made my immune system much less effective than it should have been. I likely lost telomere length and years off of my life too! My focus now will be on protecting my telomeres and doing everything I can to keep what length I have left. For me, the most striking idea was about passing down a cellular legacy through the generations. If someone is socially disadvantaged they have shorter telomeres which are then passed on to their babies in the womb. These babies with short telomeres become adults who have babies with even shorter telomeres, effectively passing the genetic legacy of poverty down through the generation, which each generation having shorter telomere and therefore more likely to face a serious illness and early death. This is just horrifying to me. It seems like an endless cycle and that people have no way to break out. Not only do you suffer from social disadvantage but your children will be genetically at a disadvantage to their peers right from the womb! Like there isn’t enough stress on pregnant mothers but now they also have to worry about harming their unborn baby’s telomeres. Of course they can’t worry too much because stress shortens telomeres too! It’s not quite that dire but if I were pregnant I would be very concerned about this. I would want my baby to have every advantage in life, including long, healthy telomeres. This underscores the importance of supporting pregnant women in every way we can to ensure that the human species will be healthy in the future. I found the science in this book fairly easy to understand. I have some background in genetics and was a teaching assistant for a course in population genetics so I'm not new to any of the terminology or the basic concepts. I think this might be a bit intense for those who don't even have a basic knowledge of chromosomes but there are lots of helpful pictures to guide you through.I received this book for free through a Goodreads Firstreads giveaway but this has not influenced my review in any way.

More importantly - can you choose which outcome will happen to you? Written by Nobel Prize winner Dr. Elizabeth Blackburn and health psychologist Dr Elissa Epel, THE TELOMERE EFFECT reveals the ground-breaking science at the heart of ageing and what you can do to help reverse it.I guess the first question is 'What is The Telomere Effect anyway?'. Well, I'm still not sure of the exact science, but it seems to be, according to the book, repeating segments of noncoding DNA that live on the ends of your chromosomes. Telomeres help to determine how fast your cells age and when they die, depending on how quickly they wear down. Long telomeres are good, short ones are bad.What does The Telomere Effect tell us?We are bombarded with the next big thing in health and fitness every single day. Juicing, fasting days, paleo, butter coffee, kale, chia, and even unpasteurised milk, are all meant to bring us amazing health benefits. Is The Telomere Effect any different to the other books out there telling us how to dramatically change our lives? Well, it is, a little. The Telomere Effect doesn't tell us anything we don't already know. Eat well, do what you love, love others, meditate, sleep properly and keep fit. We are all aware of these things, it's just life, work, and temptation get in the way!The difference with this book is that it explains in great detail the science of what happens to your body and the studies completed, which demonstrate why you should rethink how you live, if you live poorly. Be warned though, a lot of the studies were performed on animals, and I must admit I found this quite overwhelming and put me off reading some parts and learning about the specifics of how telomeres work. It's written by a Nobel Prize winner, so expect some credible evidence on these telomeres and the effect on the body, but please don't expect to find anything new about how we should live to be healthy and happy.If you are into your science, or health and fitness in a big way and want to understand why some of us look younger or have a body that seems to age before its time, then you may get something out of The Telomere Effect. However, if you are looking for a 'new way' to eat, live, and be well, this won't satisfy you. There is no miracle cure to be found within these pages that has not already been shouted from the rooftops. However, there is some science and understanding of the human body and mind to justify why we should listen to some of these health and diet recommendations.2 out of 5 from me"

First, I didn't like the narration. It felt like I was sitting through a first grade class. Second, the title was misleading. It read more like a self-help book. So much so, I thought this book was going to cover how to hold the fork and chew 2o times...to my total dismay, it got so close to that. I didn't appreciate this. I wish this covered the science and left all that simple nonsense out. So two stars."

This book specifies the advice with written exercises and habit forming activities, and chooses its advice specifically from telemere verified research.Blackmore received the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 2009 for her research into telomeres, and into telomerase on slowing aging. This comprehensive review of telomere research shows (along with articles in Sciences and leading journals) that she is still in the lead of her field, so we can trust that the (often common sense) advice she gives is scientifically rigorous.The first half of the book explains telomeres at an adequate level of detail, and describes how their length both correlates with health or disease, and explains causative biology pathways for how short telomeres operate on creating disease. This is a 2017 published book, and much of the citations are for very recent research, since it is only after 2010 that telomeres have been identified as a key mechanism by which toxic habits and thoughts lead to a shorter healthspan!The second half of the book, after a (scientifically validated) self-scored telomere length estimation survey, lays out an organized set of lifestyle interventions, a nicely clear path to protecting your telomere length, and repeats the benefits of doing so. The advice is both specific to telomere benefits, and written very actionably — a reader can immediately commit to specific behaviors and habits which will empirically improve his or her health span. One example how up to date and correct this volume is: the diet section intensely focuses on reducing sugar / glycemic index, which has become a clear consensus only in the last 2 or 3 years.Encouraging and invigorating. Crafted with meticulous care and attention to detail. Informative and an engaging pleasure to read. Pages 243–48 present a new, innovative, cogent, concise method for reliably changing habits; I’m a psych major and deep into this literature, yet it is one of the best I’ve come across.One popular comment dismisses the practicality of the advice, by belittling the questionnaire as saying care givers, people of color or hard working office people are just destined to die. That’s exactly backwards! Blackmore humorously quotes “aging is mind over matter -- if you don’t mind, it doesn’t matter.” so the emotional and biopsychological reaction to the reality is what matters most for telomeres. No matter your life circumstances, the advice is useable and practical. On page 71 is clearest distinction between the life events and the emotional attitude or interpretation of those events, and it is the later only that effects telomeres.The epigenetic aspects of telomeres over generations are uniquely meaningful. Mothers (and fathers, less) pass down the current length of their telomeres to kids, so society has a distinct reason to protect the health of unborn kids by removing stresses from pregnant women, as those stress are highly unequal by region, income, race, age and education. Why doesn’t the book list chemical or pharmaceutical methods for just lengthening one’s telomeres, especially since therapies exist for the one-in-a-million people who have genetic mutations that mandate early short telomeres and therefore lead to early deaths? Because too much telomerase causes cancer, and all the research studies around this are still pending. Ironically, longer telomeres can be indicative of active cancer, and more telomerase can suggest frantic body effort to repair shortened telomeres — this greatly complicates research, and requires attending to the tissue sources of the measured outcome. In summary, let's just keep ourselves maximally healthy until the day when a medical treatment for telomere length does become available. Great quotes herein: “I’ve lived a long life with many troubles, most of which never happened” -Mark Twain (on anxiety)“Every day, think as you wake up, today I am fortunate to be alive, I have a precious human life, I am not going to waste it."" -Dalai Lama, p120Even if some of the lifestyle advice she gives actually lengthens healthspan by some other mechanism than telomeres, such as reducing inflammation or reducing lysosomes overload, that's okay... there is some correlation happening, and this is another reason telomerase boosting alone will not yield immortality. Tetrahymena doesn't have complex systems to maintain."
10,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9779623-shaun,4,"I'm surprised by some of the negative reviews here. I will admit that the book is repetitive at times, and it does seem as if the impact of stress on telomere length gets more air time than it deserves, but I chalked this up to one of the two authors having a specialty in the field of psychology.I also can understand why the conclusions are described by some reviewers as anticlimactic. Once again, we're being told to exercise, eat whole foods, get adequate sleep and destress. Ah, duh.But, I think the strength of this book and the research is that while we've long accepted that exercise, eating whole foods, sleeping and destressing are good for us, we are only now starting to explore and understand the underlying physiologic reasons why. And anything that deepens our understanding is useful. I honestly don't know what people expect when they read a book like this? To learn that exercise, whole foods, sleep and stress management aren't good for us after all? Or maybe they are hoping for a magic pill...which is kind of the point. Magic pills don't exist. Interestingly, despite an every-growing multibillion dollar health and wellness industry we've never been sicker or fatter, which may be in part due to the fact that the emphasis (sometimes misguided and sometimes on point) has been primarily on food and exercise. The role of sleep and stress is mentioned but almost as an aside. Yet books like this suggest that the latter as important, maybe even more important, and the telomere effect may be one explanation why.In a nutshell, telomeres are a noncoding form of DNA that protects our chromosomes (the DNA/genes in our cells). Over time, the telomeres shorten to a point where they can no longer do their job. The result is cellular death and ultimately aging and disease. Research has identified various factors that impact telomere length. A large part of the discussion focuses on stress. In the end, the research on telomeres only further strengthens what we already know: exercise, whole foods, sleep and stress management are all good for us. Surprise, surprise. But more importantly, it deepens our understanding of why those recommendations are valid and important."
11,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2945070-thom,1,"Telomeres are one of the more fascinating things from research into DNA - repetitive sequences of base pairs at the end of each chromosome, because each time they are copies, chromosomes are shortened. This book, written by one of the original scientists involved, unfortunately focuses more on self help than science.Telomeres start out long in children and get shorter as we age. As they get shorter, we are also more susceptible to disease - our protecting cells work less efficiently as they age. Blackburn was a co-discoverer of telomerase, an enzyme that can replenish telomeres to some extent. Rather than going deeper into the mechanisms of this, or why we can't just go around mainlining telomerase, the authors instead survey a broad range of activities and look at how they affect your telomeres.So instead of science, this book preaches the benefits of exercise, fruits & vegetables, and mindfulness meditation, while also emphasizing the evils of stress, smoking, sugar, and processed meats. This in itself isn't bad, but the science is shaky. ""Three studies showed..."" out of how many performed? ""We saw improvements..."" details? I stopped and skimmed the rest of the book at this point.Turns out Dr. Blackburn co-founded the company Telomere Health, which offers telomere length testing to the public. Perhaps a portion of this book was driven by that work - she has since severed ties with that company.In summary, if you would like to read another self-help book, go for it. If you are looking for science on telomeres, this book contains only a fragment. I plan to check out a few TED talks by this author and hopefully track down a more science based work in the future."

13,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1725471-gordon,5,"The Telomere Effect was written by Elizabeth Blackburn, who won the Nobel Prize in 2009 for decoding the telomere, and her UC San Francisco colleague Elissa Epel, a health psychologist. The collaboration is an incredibly fruitful one, bringing very complementary perspectives to figuring out how to make practical use of what we know about telomeres.Telomeres are the structures at the ends of DNA that protect the DNA during cell division, like the plastic tips at the ends of shoelaces. With age and abuse (smoking, stress, etc), the telomeres get shorter. When the telomere is gone, the DNA no longer works, and neither does the cell which it controls. Result: cell death or cell malfunction, which may result in damaging the surrounding cells, for example by triggering systemic inflammation. The authors claim that telomere length is one of the best measures of general health. The good news is that telomere length doesn't just go in one direction -- shorter -- but can also get longer by virtue of repair by a repair enzyme called telomerase. The even better news is that you, the owner and operator of the body, can strongly influence the whole process by making better life choices. Key ones include:* Reduce stress by using mindfulness techniques and lifestyle changes, for example* Exercise more, especially but not exclusively by doing aerobic exercise (the more different kinds of exercise, the better).* Avoid environmental toxins, such as household cleaners of the non-natural variety. * Eat organic foods and follow a Mediterranean style diet. On over-eating and obesity: Body weight is not in itself a great predictor of health, but less belly fat is.* Choose to live in stronger, closer community and do what you can to personally make it stronger -- help out your neighbors!* Get as much sleep as you need, minimum seven hours.* Be in the moment and stop pretending you can successfully multi-task.* Create a sense of purpose in your life and be conscientious about following that purpose.I think you get the idea, although there is much more than just the above, including great suggestions on raising healthier children. The Telomere Effect is a science-based approach to longer, happier and especially healthier living. It's well worth your time to read and even more worth your time to put into practice."

Such as, I always thought I was just the normal amount of jaded and cynical of people from living in cities and driving in traffic, but it turns out that my knee-jerk reaction to many stressors tends to be in the pessimist range. I don't neccessarily assume that people are out to pull one over on me, but I do have fleeting thoughts about people being careless, oblivious, even greedy and self-serving. These hostile stress reactions may be normal, but they're not necessarily healthy. I do need to work on trying to be more open to people, cultivate an optimistic attitude.The book is filled with multiple self-tests to help focus in on problematic areas in your life that can be improved: sleep, diet, exercise, stress reactions, conscientiousness, optimism. I really liked the helpful handling of how to focus your thoughts, release negative feelings, and recover from a bad mood or ruminating about negative thoughts.

16,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38036772-annie,4,"Telomeres: you know those plastic aglets on the ends of your shoelaces that keep them from fraying. Well, telomeres are the aglets of your chromosomes, keeping the genetic material from unraveling. Telomeres shorten over time naturally. A baby has about 10,000 basepairs. A 65-year-old has about 4,800 basepairs on average. When telomeres become too short, the chromosome cells stop dividing altogether; they no longer renew themselves, and the person ages and dies.Lots of things can affect telomere length, though--which means you can take steps to keep your telomeres as long as possible.Anxiety and stress shorten your telomeres, but de-stressing activities like meditation, qigong, and yoga preserve or lengthen them. Likewise, social cohesion and sense of community are good for your telomeres; lack of sleep, or poor-quality sleep, is bad for telomeres. Eating processed meats like hotdogs will shorten them quickly; fresh vegetables will lengthen telomeres. If you experience stressful events in your childhood (like abuse or poverty), that contributes to shorter telomeres. Interestingly, because children inherit telomeres from their parents' sex cells, this has a cumulative effect on families: if your parents had hard lives, you will likely have shorter telomeres. But if you have a lower-stress life, eat well, exercise, and engage in positive activities like meditation, you can build up your telomeres so that you give your children the best shot possible. Of course, this isn't always possible, and raises some interesting questions about racial imbalance in the United States. Why do black Americans have shorter lifespans and poorer health than white Americans? Partially that's due to racist healthcare practices and poverty, but could it also be because for generations, telomeres have just been getting shorter and shorter? Think of the children of slaves, for instance: no doubt they would have very short telomeres as a result of the incredible stress of their parents' lives. And those shorter telomeres would be passed on to their children and grandchildren and so forth. There are people who say that ""slavery is over"" so ""why are we still talking about it."" Well--here is one example of how it's not over. How its effects could still be felt by children born today. Anyway, this is a great, reader-friendly explanation of what telomeres are, why they matter, and what practices you can engage in to age slower and live longer. "

If you like to read science articles, this book is definitely not for you, you'd be much better off reading online content. At most, find this book in a bookstore or library and browse the first section, you'll be done in far less than an hour, and save both time and money. The authors, two women, both PhDs, worked very hard to make this book easy enough for non-technical people to understand, which I found frustrating because I had hoped for a few more technical details about telmoeres specifically, and genetics in general. Those details were far too few. Also the style is a little disconcerting, you never know who is speaking - until you come across one of these, ""I (Liz)"" or ""I (Elissa)"". That doesn't work well for me, having one main author, with quotes from the other, would have been far better. Also the book is really, really, really wordy, it could have been 1/4 the size and been far more effective, but the authors obviously wanted to sell a book, not an article, which would have been more appropriate. Instead of giving us more details about their scientific voyage of discovery, they decided instead to inundate us with self-help content. The self-help content is at least 90% of the book, and I would be surprised if any reader reads the whole thing, unless the book is actually placed in the self-help section. If it's in the science section sales will surely be disappointing. I will not be reading anything else by these authors, they wanted a book and they got one, but it is a huge disappointment if you love science, they would better serve us by writing technical articles."

All right there. There is nothing ‘revolutionary’ in this book. Do cardio and sleep 7 hours a night? Ok thanks. There is soooo much repetition in this book. So many times they mention mindfulness, it’s like they have money in it. The same concepts get hammered over and over. And if they substituted ‘telomeres’ with ‘because it’s good for you’ it would really mean the same thing to the reader. I'll give it 2 starts because it's always good to be reminded of this stuff, but it's a magazine article not a 300+ page book.And yes I ate 3 Fudge Stripes while writing this review. "

The significant scientific evidence shows we have more control over our aging process than we might think. I was excited about this Nobel Prize news in 2009 and shared it enthusiastically with my yoga students then. This book is very accessible for the lay person and for anyone interested in the science backed up by thousands of studies that inform their recommendations. A few reviewers felt the book was, ""telomeres for dummies"", and ""same old, nothing new"". But I disagree. It clearly and concisely explains the otherwise dry science and tells a compelling story, along with pragmatic recommendations backed up by the most sound scientific research available. The research that shows we can protect and even grow our telomeres, is renewed inspiration vs. leap of faith or anecdotes offered in most health & wellness books.For anyone who cares about living healthier longer, not just living longer, reading this book is worth more than paying for a miracle face cream, spa treatment or even a yoga class : )Namaste,Sookiewww.mykarmayoga.com"

This clearly written and engaging book is about the science behind the mind-body connection. Many of us have known instinctively that attitude, disposition and lifestyle can have an effect on health and aging but Nobel Prize-winning Doctor Elizabeth Blackburn has discovered the biological basis for that mechanism. Telomerase is the enzyme that replenishes telomeres and this protects our DNA. When telomeres get short due to stress, we age more quickly.Blackburn discusses the things that shorten our telomeres and what we can do to improve and lengthen our telomeres. Long and healthy telomeres keep us vital and disease-free for longer. This book gives clear instructions on achievable lifestyle changes that can buy you years of living well.Thank you Netgalley for the e-review edition of this book."

I teach Biology, so I already have some background knowledge when it comes to Telomeres, but you don't have to know about it to read and enjoy this book. It is written by a biologist and a psychologist in such a way that anyone could pick it up and understand exactly what they're talking about. I think the title helps attract readers because who doesn't want to know how to live younger, healthier and longer? But the book is so much more than a how-to, self-help type of reading. It presents the science behind why eating healthy, working out regularly and taking care of ourselves isn't just good for us today and maybe the years to come, but how it truly affects us at the cellular level and how it can actually be passed to our offspring and then their offspring and so on. The book presents concepts that are backed by research and scientific experiments, but again it is written in such a way that it is easy to understand. The authors also provide resources if you'd like to learn more or take any of the assessments that are offered in the book. I enjoyed reading this book and taking the time to really think about my life and some of the things that I can do better to protect my telomeres. I will definitely use this information when teaching Biology this year."

The basics are the basics are the basics: in order to give ourselves the best chance to live long and healthy we should eat a diet of nutritious whole foods, avoid processed foods, avoid sugar, exercise regularly, limit our exposure to stress when possible, manage stress when it's not possible to limit our exposure to stress, nurture our close relationships, practice mindfulness, and limit our exposure to toxins of all sorts. What this book offers that is different is a discussion of how these elements of a healthy lifestyle affect the human body at the cellular level. That was interesting but in the end didn't fully hold my attention. Renewed determination to continue with or improve the habits that allow me to be healthy? Check. That'll do for this book."

29,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6397454-peggy,4,"I kind of expected this book to simply rehash the usual advice that we'd all be healthier and happier if we ate better, relaxed more, and exercised, and yes, the book does make that point, but it does it in a much more thorough and compelling way than a typical self-help type of book tends to do. For one thing, the authors have some serious credibility on the subject (Blackburn won the Nobel Prize for her work with telomeres) and the book is extremely strong on backing up its claims -- and backing them up very honestly. They don't just say that some study showed something. They will qualify that the study was small or had some other limitation so that it's clear which studies are truly major findings and which simply indicate a possibility that needs more study. On the weak side, my eyes tended to glaze over a bit when they would get technical on the biochemistry of it all, but in all fairness to the authors, my eyes tend to glaze over any time I see multi-syllabic chemical terminology. Reading the list of ingredients in a Twinkie zombifies me. Unlike the Twinkie people, these authors do a very good job of using a good bit of metaphor and simile so that the statements of scientific gobbledygook are comprehensible to people like me. In other words, they're providing the detailed scientific detail when they need it (useful to people who aren't like me) but also give the big picture of what the point of knowing all that detail is (useful to people like me who care less about the nuts and bolts of the science and more about the ""so what?"" of the results).And yes, the big takeaway is that we will be healthier longer if we take care of our telomeres which means eating well, exercising, avoiding stress, etc., so if you're looking for an earth-shattering magic pill for a long, healthy life, you're not going to find it here. What you will get are some concrete ideas for how to eat, exercise, avoid stress, and some compelling reasons why you should. I particularly liked their discussion of how we affect our children's telomeres from the moment of conception on, and the need for some improved public policy to keep environmental factors from damaging telomeres across generations. Was this a page turner? No, it's a more serious read than that and you'll probably get more out of it if you read it at a slower pace and digest it in bits rather than try to plow through it in an afternoon at the beach. Was it worth reading? Absolutely. I'm already someone who tries to eat well, exercise, and all that, but this book has inspired me to do some longer-term thinking about how I'm doing that, how I can do it better, and what we all need to do to help each other keep our telomeres long."

The same effect as nutrogenomics and epigenetics, but explained by the biochemical means of shortened telomeres which lead to lesser DNA replication. Message of the book was the same as every healthy living book, but tries to explain why you should because of the correlation between unhealthy living and telomeres.I would have preferred to read about the biochemical mechanism for how the presence of cortisol impacts telomeres, or lack of exercise, or poor diet… instead of just having the author tell me that it does. This book was just another reason why it's important to live a healthy lifestyle because of the impact to telomeres, but did not tell me how these factors affect telomeres, just that they do. I am sure that there is causation, but the author only discusses correlation in this book.Senescence - the point at which cells permanently stop dividing. The natural limit is called the Hayflick limit, reached when telomeres reach a certain short length.Telomeres are comprised of repeated patterns of DNA that signify replication: TTAGGG/AATCCCTelomerase is the enzyme that rebuilds telomeres, but can only be supplanted to an extent. Not enough and telomeres get shorter. Too much and they replicate too much = cancer.Stress - small doses do not endanger telomeres, but can actually be good at boosting cellular health (hormesis = toughening). Chronic stress leads to shorter telomeres.	- How we respond to challenges: with anxiety and fear, or excitement and confidence - impacts telomere health	- Athletes able to make stress work for them had longer telomeres.T-cells fight viral infections. When infected, telomerase spikes to replicate T-cells to fight infection. As T-cell telomeres grow shorter, lose the ability to replicate T-cells and body becomes poorer at fighting infection.MBCT - mindfulness based cognitive therapy has been shown to be effective as an antidepressant and preserves telomere length.MBSR - mindfulness based stress reduction - 17% increase in telomerase over 3months by those who practice compared vs. a control of those who do not.Study of qigong practitioners - ""relaxation response"" - activation of the parasympathetic nervous system and dilation of blood vessels during meditative activity.For preserving telomerase, two kinds of exercise stood out:	- Moderate aerobic exercise performed 3 times per week for 45mins at a time	- HIIT	- Resistance exercise had no significant effect on telomerase activity.Impact of sleep - fewer than 7hrs and telomeres begin to shorten.Strongest impact on telomere length is stress/depression. Afterwards it's belly weight (not total weight) - depression is 3x more impactful on telomere length. Consumption of omega 3's helps telomere length, but foods high in omega 6 and saturated fats shorten telomere length. Drinking 8oz of soda daily makes telomeres the equivalent of 2yrs older.Telomere-friendly foods: whole food snacks high in proteins and omega3 polyunsaturated fats, low in sugar.Discrimination had a low effect on telomere length, but internalization of discrimination had a high effect. Being the victim of racism is not a problem - letting others' racist behavior affect you is. Same goes for biological embedding - childhood trauma affects telomere length, but can be reversed if rescued from adversity (e.g. romanian orphanages)"

This book is a good summary on the research done to date, and the things that hurt and help in the quest to live a life that is full of healthy years. There are two things that would have made this book better. First, editing to remove the repetition. At 335 pages, there is more than enough information without repeating it. (Although I do see the irony, given that repeats are essentially what make telomeres protective.) Second, re-arranging the order of the book would be helpful. It starts with the things in adulthood that are detrimental, then the things that adults can do that are helpful. Then it speaks to pregnancy and childhood, without stating whether the things that one can do in adulthood can positively influence (even if not fully overcome) the effects of what has happened during one's earlier years. Personally, I think both from a chronological standpoint and a call to action, it would be better to end on what one can do to make a difference in the telomeres of ourselves and others."

There's nothing groundbreaking here but it gives a solidity to the knowledge that you need to de-stress, exercise, eat well, and be in healthy relationships in order to lengthen telomeres and have a longer health span.

47,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24646822-supinder,5,"I loved this book. It is written in a highly accessible manner - in which the latest research on Telomeres is buttressed with practical activities that one can do in order to protect and prevent the deterioration of the Telomeres.Key takeaways from the book include:Cells reach a state of Senescence – where they no longer experience cell division. This is called the Hayflick limit – a natural limit for which human cells have for dividing. The telomeres have become critically short. Senescent cells can leak a proinflammatory fluid, making the body less resistant to illness and disease. The accumulation of senescent cells reduces lifespan for the organism. Eventually, the senescent cell will undergo apoptosis – programmed cell death. Senescence is linked to the length of the telomeres. Research has demonstrated that caregivers had shorter telomeres than non-caregivers. This was associated with the increased stress of the caregiver’s role. It was not just the actual stress of the role which induced the shortening of the telomeres but the perceived and anticipatory stress of the job. The mentality of the subject and how they feel towards stress is of interest. Individuals who regarded stress as being a challenge that should be welcomed did not notice this diminishment to their telomeres. If one has a ‘bring it on’ attitude towards stress – this did not reduce the length of the telomeres. Small doses of stress have been shown to be healthy – teenagers who had experienced a modicum of stressful events during childhood had been shown to exhibit more of the challenge response. The child must know that they have the necessary resources in order to deal with stressful occurrences. The physiological changes that one associated with the stressed state can be re-interpreted by the individual as being signs that an exciting challenge is taking place. Research has demonstrated that by making these simple adjustment students where able to score higher on tests and perform better at interviews. Create distance between your thoughts and emotions. One can do this by talking to oneself in the third person. One is not emotion or thought. These are simply random occurrences that one has to deal with. Think of a stressful event with the distance of time; imagine how one might consider or interpret the same event in 5 or 10 years’ time. The emotional resonance of the event will be extinguished. A variation of the same concept can be practiced via visually distancing; imagine the same event but this time imagine the event taking place in the far horizon. A pessimistic mindset affects telomeres. People who are pessimists exhibited shorter telomeres – thus the strategy of optimism is optimal one for health and longevity. Rumination is defined as the constant remembrance of a typically negative experience of thought – this has the effect of the stressful event affecting the hormone levels within the body – via a psychosomatic response. Research has demonstrated that those individuals who ruminate over negative experiences have shorter telomeres – thus again the act of rumination is a negative one for longevity. Self-love and self-compassion are key to long telomeres. Being compassionate to oneself for all the accumulated flaws that one has picked up over a lifetime is key. Treat yourself as you would a child. One would not seek to be demonstrative or harsh to a child – so why beat one’s self over such trifles. Especially if the accumulated effect if to lead to negative health outcomes. Self-criticism is a negative form of self-improvement and does naught to improve telomere length or overall health. A test for the individual’s optimism or pessimism bias is the “Life Orientation Test-Revised” (LOT – R) by Professor Charles Carver and Michael Scheier. One should not avoid stressful or anxious events – by avoidance of these things one makes their own life smaller and one does not get an opportunity to habituate oneself to discomfort or anxiety. By doing what we feel afraid to do, we overcome the anxiety and fearfulness that held us back. Mindfulness helps – in being absorbed in the ‘now’ rather than fretful or full or anxiety either ruminating on past events or thinking on the potential negative consequences of future action. Mindfulness will aid in reducing the type of destructive anxiety which has been demonstrated to shorten telomeres. Exercise helps protect telomere shortening; moderate aerobic exercise for 45mins, 3 times a week had a noticeable positive effect of telomere length. Also helping was HIIT training, in which an intense burst of activity was carried out followed by a period in which the individual recovered. Both these activities had an effect on telomeres. Sleep is crucial to telomere health; getting less than 7 hours of sleep/day shortened telomere length. One way to limit inflammation is to stop feeding it. Pro-inflammatory foods include processed foods such as sugar, white bread, and all refined carbohydrates. Relate life to an intrinsic motivational goal that one has. This should not be linked to extrinsic consumerist attainment such as the purchase of a new commodity. Buy more house plants – good choices include Boston Ferns, Peace Lilies and English Ivy. Smile more at people – develop social capital. How we interact with other people shapes their feelings and sense of trust. Every day, each of us has the chance to positively impact the lives and telomeres of those around us."

The authors basically tell you what you already know about being healthy - you should eat well, exercise, and deal with stress, etc. - and then add that, in addition to shortening your life, these things are also associated with shortened telomeres, which themselves are associated with shorter lives.

52,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49697463-laurap,1,"A life style book masquerading as a scientific one, titled ""The telomere effect"" that never once explains why your telomeres shorten every time a cell divides. This is what you're getting yourself into. Honestly, no need to pick this book. If you're looking for health advice there are other good books you can try. They can offer you the same information without lying to you that their advice is supported by strong scientific research. Now you might think I'm mean, but I actually know why telomeres shorten every time a cell divides (I too got a bloody PhD in biology). I also happen to know that some of the stuff said in the book either do not constitute strongly supported scientific information or are flat-out wrong. There are many problems. I listened to an audio version of the book, but I also went through an ebook. The e-book had several errors at one of the self evaluations ( you couldn't get to the max score no matter how you tried because the scores you are supposed to sum up were all wrong. The audio book actually had the correct information). And I have to admit I quit the audio book about an hour and a half before the end. I had stomached a bunch of erroneous statements up until that point. What broke me was the statement that your college degree will enlarge your telomeres. But I'll get to that in a second.I realized I may have troubles with the book from the first chapter. The two authors of the book talked about what diseases are caused by shortened telomeres. No doubt age related diseases are linked to shortened telomeres. Asthma, however, is not. Yet that's what the first chapter seems to imply. Still because a little later the authors explain that correlation doesn't necessarily mean causation, or that the causation happens in the order we first hypothesize, I was willing to give them another chance. So a little later in the book the authors admitted that chronic diseases such as asthma actually causes shortened telomeres and not the other way around ( The reason is simple, chronic inflammation means cells need to divide more often than they normally would, which means telomere shortening over time.). So far the biologist in me was appeased.Then things got a little weird when they talked about meditation. Still I had to admit that their idea about avoiding negative thoughts, stress and unhealthy eating were all correct and helpful. Weather you need to frame it as a telomere problem... let's just say I wasn't bought on that.When they got to how depression can impact telomere length I started getting angry again. The authors seem to imply that depression is just getting trapped in a feeling of sadness. I never suffered from chronic depression yet I got angry at how inaccurate that definition is. You want a good book on depression? Try ""The depths"". Skip the depression chapter in this book, It is honestly insulting and potentially harmful.  Then we got to dieting. The authors wrongly suggested that dieting is not the way to drop weight. Guess what? Scientific evidence suggests that actually you need to restrict your calories to start dropping weight. It is correct that you should also exercise and tone your muscles. It is not enough to drop weight. Do yourself a favour, and read recent articles on the matter before you harm yourself. And now let's get to the part that broke me: Did you know that not finishing College actually shortens your telomeres? Studies show that people who don't complete higher education have shortened telomeres. The reason? Well, it's actually explained in the earlier chapters of the book. If you didn't go to college, it's more likely that you live in a poor neighbourhood that you have poor social support and that you're eating an unhealthy diet. Did two scientists who should know about the scientific method explain this? Maybe they did in the chapters I didn't finish reading. But they strongly stated that not finishing College actually impacts not only your telomeres but those of your child as well. So practically, give up already! You've doomed yourself and your unborn children by not going to college! How could you? So I did what the author suggested in one of the earlier chapters: If something stresses you out or angers you just give up. I returned a book to the library and I was instantly happier. My brain stopped having seizures from so many incorrect Zen garbage packaged as science. And I could focus on my day and be grateful.Conclusion: skip the book!!! I would give it 0 stars, but that's not available."

The longer they are, the better. These are what govern how we age, and how fast we age. Don't think they are set in stone, though, not by any means. Like all else of biology, and truly, of life, telomere length is a functional result of interconnected forces, and can be acted upon by our thoughts and behaviours. In language highly engaging, and eminently readable, Blackburn and Epel will teach you all about what telomeres are, what they do, why they are important, and how to influence them. One of the biggest threats to telomere length, it is no surprise, is stress. Sleep deprivation is another. Both of these things are of particular interest to me as I suffer from chronic fatigue/ fibromyalgia. Stress and lack of sleep are two things, especially in combination, that can trigger a serious pain flare. All of this only adds further mental and physical stress, so I can only imagine what my own telomeres are like! The information in this book has helped me view things differently, and to begin making changes that can only help. Chapter Six was especially useful.There are four sections, with assessment points within each section. Part One contains three chapters, and is an introduction to telomere science. This part also introduces the concept of renewal labs. Every subsequent chapter in the next three parts have a renewal lab at the end. Part Two looks at how stress affects the telomeres, and how they respond to your thoughts. Negative and depressed thinking severely damage them. Chapter Six has a special master tips for renewal section with stress reducing techniques. Part Three discusses practical ways to help our telomeres. These chapters look at physical stress, the value of sleep, nutrition, and exercise. Part Four takes a look at how outside forces affect telomeres, noting that cellular aging begins in the womb, especially affected by the health and stress of the mother. Childhood is another important time for shaping telomeres. This book piqued my anthropologist's interest regarding average life expectancy over generations. Sure, greater medical technology and care played a part in increased life expectancy, but this got me to thinking that the brutality of past eras, and of certain classes/castes must have played it's fair share in shortening telomeres thanks to mental and physical stress, and thus shortened life expectancy. And, of course, it supports the metaphysicist’s and quantum physicist's notion of interconnection and the true power of the mind/intention and it's ability to influence things.Despite some of the scary information about how badly shortened telomeres can affect us, we can, thankfully, start at any time the repair process. We have that built-in ability because feck it, our bodies really are cool, and intelligent all on their own if we get out of their way. We may not be able to attain maximum resiliency, but we can improve things a great deal. If our cells feel young and healthy, *we* will feel young and healthy. Blackburn and Epel can help you begin those changes. 📚📚📚📚📚 Very highly recommended. "
54,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37771178-heather,4,"Most of the guidance on living better wasn't new, but the science behind it was new for me and incredibly interesting. It made so much more sense of the standard lifestyle and health advice that I have felt a little bombarded by at times.Let's be honest, we've all heard things like eating better and spending more time outside are so good for us to the point where it's almost annoying to hear again. At the same time, what makes this book stand out from all the random advice we're given from almost every form of media is that it provides concrete biological evidence as to why these effect us the way they do. Blackburn and Epel don't just say things like, eating sugar is bad because they have calories and calories makes us fat, but they breakdown the way sugars effect us in the short and long term and why some sugary foods are worse than others. They cite research and they specify what was accounted for within it. I don't often see things like what the control was asked to do or what factors were controlled for, like whether or not the researchers had accounted for whether a person smokes. These finer details really make the book stand out among those aiming to inspire people to live better. Their evidence is way more concrete than the random correlations that I've seen others talk about.I enjoyed the ""Renewal Labs"" and the ""Telomere Tips"" at the end of each chapter where several ideas to help with each change were given and the way the authors stress that small changes are better to make in the beginning or just focusing on one thing to change rather than trying to make a radical lifestyle change. Add something or expand the change when it has become a new normal in life. That makes sense and we all know to do it, but the writing style really gives the reader permission to take things really slowly, as opposed to some other health books I've read before. They actively encouraged that the reader make the smaller changes rather than bigger ones that have been proven to not last in what seemed like countless cited studies. I also appreciated the way they had information on how long the effects of a short change lasted on the body and whether the longer term effect was good or bad. Telomeres are interesting little things that give me some hope. I come from a family t hat is generally told we look younger than we are, so I didn't come into the book concerned for my healthspan. Honestly, it was one of the books I had chosen because Dr. Blackburn is a Nobel Laureate in Physiology or Medicine for the very discovery of telomeres and telomerase (along with Carol W. Greider and Jack W. Szostak). I had no idea how all those things that lifestyle and health people tell you are actually connected to health and looking young but it makes sense now. Especially the looking young part. After having read a few self-help and diet books on this sort of thing, it was helpful to get to this one. Honestly, I wish I could have just started here. It helps me wrap my head around what I need to do to make changes to know the how behind it all and not just get what seems to me like random associations. Shortening telomeres are more quantifiable than whether or not I feel better when I do something. It also made a whole lot more sense out of how and why you can have too much of a good thing that should make you healthier but really only makes you sicker."

No shit. What does it have to say about telomeres? I mean, it defines them. . .but then it just takes chapters from extant books and adds ""shortens your telomeres"" to every negative descriptor. What does it have to say about stress? Literally nothing useful -- Society is a a system that people seem to not even have the curiosity to ask ""Why does this thing even DO anyway?"" in the Us. .. which I've got a whole rant about why that might be, but the point is that a useful book discussing ways to improve health hazards from stress wouldn't focus on the individual, a hundred thousand self help books stand testament to the laughable failure that method is. Rather, what can we do, systemically? You wanna talk about stress, tell me how to end poverty, racism, sexism, imprisonment, violence, and illness. Illness is not a personal failing, it's a bug in the OS of society. Again, if were just about personal failings, these books would have put an end to all suffering by now. Fancy that, doesn't look like they did. To be clear, yes you need something to give people as a replacement method of thought, but first you have to change the system that incentivizes a shitty lifestyle. You can read a poster that says ""fail better!"" every day, but if you live in the US, man, you're pretty damn unlikely to end up being able to embrace that. Social engineering should take place at the systems level, starting with what gets incentivized. Just telling people to live differently will work for a few people, but it completely misses the point. Or has noone else noticed how scarily high depression rates have gotten? So, in short: This book lies about what it is, and sucks at what it actually tries to do. BTW: Blackburn is a legit scientist with some serious cred to her name. But she's also a new-agy sort with a weird enthusiasm for 'mindfulness'. Plenty of pretty badass scientists get equally worked up in making mirror neurons into some kind of god neuron, up to an including being the literal seat of the human soul. . .soo. . .I mean. . .A bad book doesn't make her a bad scientist, but neither does being a good scientist make this a good book. This is a bad, bad book."
56,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20465079-tam,2,"I wish I liked the book, but I didn't, even though I think it's useful.What is particularly great in this book is that it is indeed backed up by a lot of research, and I mean a lot, these are two prominent researchers, one having won a Nobel Prize. So take their words.What is not so great is that the book is actually formatted as a kind of self-help book. The book could provide some pretty concrete tools dealing with mental and health problems, from simple exercise routine, some meditation/breathing practice, to types of diet. Great to know the mechanism explaining why these advice work too, in the powerful telomere indeed proven in research for both short-term and long-term effects. Now, it would be useful for super newbies, I think, like me who is faintly aware that I need to be more concerned about my health but do not know where to start. For people who are already engaging in/starting healthy lifestyle, this book doesn't provide anything new except for more reference and another clear scientific mechanism. For many others, they would not be able to get interested, since the book's writing is just... so banal. The two authors take turns talking in first voice, which is weird and not cohesive to me. The illustrative stories are so boring. I feel like they could not get connected to the readers, common people of different backgrounds, perhaps because of the way they do research that tends to be abstract and distant, in the lab and in theory, or because of their own background being white upper middle class, highly educated maybe. I couldn't find any passage that I'm actually moved. Have they ever been through similar difficulties, severe stresses, diseases, accidents, or been raised in difficult situations, in poverty? The answer is likely to be no. I don't hate them for that, they try to show compassion but readers can definitely tell there is a gap there.If the book had been written not as a self-help but more of a general nonfic, focusing on discoveries, details, challenges, future of research related to Telomere, mayyy be it would be better since the compassion property is not that important. I said `maybe' because as in any field, you need some kinds of drama in the academia circle to spice things up, and I have no idea whether this is the case for Telomere."
57,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6289427-tara-l-campbell,2,"The subtitle is a screaming clue as to where your expectations should be set before reading. I clearly missed it, or was a little too optimistic, because this ended up a self-help book with roughly 30% of the inspiring science woven in.The first few chapters are great with the setup of the doctors' lifelong work and research, and explained in accessible terms what telomeres are and their importance. The rest, however, was a mix between the ""mays"" (there may be an association, something may be attributed, etc.), chapters of things that shorten telomeres and in turn your life (stress, bad diet, risky behaviors, poor exercise), and some generalized practical information on how to address these areas in your life. None of these are revelatory and all are things we already know.I have an issue with their crutch for illustrating stress, using ""mothers of autistic children"" repeatedly to the point that you start to wonder if the authors have a strange beef with autistic people. Insert ""mothers of gay children"" or ""mothers of colorblind children"" and see how badly it reads. Instead of placing the blame on our society's lack of inclusion for people with differences, it reads as: don't be autistic, look at the terrible things you've done to mothers.The other objection that stands out is the tip-toe dance around the impacts of sugar and processed foods on health. In the chapter on being overweight, the authors indicate overall fatness was not a detriment to one's health, it's the presence of belly fat that needs to be addressed as it's a critical metabolic indicator of health. The authors lamented the folly of dieting, how it does not offer any lasting results, in fact, making you worse off than if you hadn't dieted in the first place (no objection with this part, study after study shows this). Yet they inserted just a short snippet stating that sugar and refined carbohydrates are the source of the metabolic problems that come with the belly fat. Not anywhere close to the level of detail they provided in other chapters that illustrate the impact of the various stressors. It's bewildering to say the least.I don't disagree with the recommendations, but they're generalized things we already know.This would have been such a great book if they'd stripped the self-help out and allowed the authors to expand on the research they've done going back to the 70s."
58,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25462655-ben,3,"Self-help book couched as a scientific breakthroughIf you're looking for a book to motivate you to take up new whole-body lifestylepractices to reduce stress, then this is for you. If you're looking forscientific breakthroughs in our understanding of longevity and novel changes youcan make to improve your own health, you won't find that here. The good news isthat the lifestyle changes proposed in this book are by no means controversial.You likely already know what they are: eat healthfully and decrease stress (bothpsychological and physiological, which turn out to be very intertwined).My main complaint is that the book promises to establish a strong causal connection between telomere length and overall health and a direct way to optimize this, but only manages to establish telomere length as a marker of cumulative bodily stress and makes recommendations on how to reduce stress in general. The fact that high levels of telomerase do not always result in increased telomere length and that longer telomeres can actually be detrimental in some cases (by leading to cancer or promoting cell growth of undesirable systems) show that telomeres are not the entire story (or at least that we do not understand how telomeres work fully enough to make recommendations strictly on this basis). In this sense, the book overpromises and under-delivers.Other nits (in no particular order):- The first section reads as an autobiographical recounting of the authors’ achievements but is not very actionable- Sloppy editing and style: “I (Liz)” and “I (Elissa)” sprinkled throughout - Not nearly enough citations for some of the strong causal claims the authors make- Renewal lab sections often lack citations and have no connection to earlier material in the chapterDespite the negative points, I think this book can be a useful tool in improving overall mental health (and that it does a good job of showing that this does affect other aspects of physical health). In particular, the advice on resilient thinking is likely actionable and effective. Similarly, the dieting advice is actionable and likely effective (based on other reading I’ve done, but not based on evidence provided by this book) though incomplete.Overall, some may find this book useful, but it didn’t quite align with my expectations."
59,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37060155-mike,4,"This is an excellent introduction into the world of telomeres. They are the tiny bits of DNA that keep your chromosomes from unraveling. The length of your telomeres can directly measure your biological age and by extension your state of overall health.I liked that it is a joint effort of a molecular biologist and a health psychologist as everything is linked. There are studies after studies that show how your mind affects your overall health & vice versa. Here the molecular science is matched up to external forces to demonstrate that your thoughts & actions do change your cells. I have seen this concept repeated in many books over the last year. Fat communicates to the brain, as does your gut biome, which in turn take direction from the brain.The book is filled with ways you can help your body keep your telomere lengths as long as possible. Part of this is diet, exercise and mindset. If you want a super good way of thinking about eating better, think about how each meal choice is helping or hurting your telomeres. They can tolerate short term shocks, but not chronic behaviors. Even if you start at 50, they can still heal. The message is the same as many other books on overall health. Get enough sleep, exercise regularly, eat whole fresh food and have a solid social net around you. It is not a fluke that the highest concentration of centurions in the world is in Okinawa. There, the people practice exactly that and live past 100.I have seen the results of behavior that hastens the shortening of telomeres along with behavior that kept them long. A group of my relatives decided that the best thing for themselves was to smoke and drink to excess. Plus they added their always angry attitude and bad food to make it even worse. They all died in their early 60’s of multiple cancers. Pictures of them in their 50’s look like they are 80. No joke. Another group of relatives are currently in their mid-90’s & not living in a senior home. They live in their own house and take care of themselves. Still sharp, though a little hard of hearing. Their only vices have been coffee and being in the sun for hours on end. From this book the underlying reason is telomere length. From their studies and evidence, I can see why."
60,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25317263-austin-gaghadar,4,"Overall I thought that book was quite well done in describing and outlining the mechanism through which some well established environmental and internal circumstances can lead to a change in our health. I thought the book was well organized in first describing what telomeres were then, touching on the importance of the telomere and concluding with ways that individuals can address their telomeres and a discussion of the different factors that impact the length of telomeres. In addition I felt that for the most part the book had a very optimistic and practical bent, covering how it is never too late to start to make worthwhile changes in your lifestyle, and that while you may have deterministically bad circumstances there are still ways to try to recover through individual effort. As an individual connected to the academic world I also appreciated the subdued language used by the author when describing the results that they found always tempered by the limitations of the studies that were used but still trying as best they could to outline in a way that a non-specialist could understand the main results of the research being conducted. With a good outline of the methodology and the logic underlying the authors assertion of a causal effect between different lifestyle choices/circumstances and telomere related metrics, allowing the reader to reach their own conclusions on the persuasiveness of the studies as well. The one mechanism that I thought was the most important and revolutionary personally was the importance of mindfullness physiologically, since I had previously believed that this was a mental phenomenon that could support mental health but did not have the type of impact on cell biology that I now know exists and will definitely keep in mind moving forward. At times I thought that book could have been a little more concise but in addition to the science I did enjoy the inclusion of personal anecdotes in order to relate the ideas to real people making it easier to relate to the subject matter. Overall this book gave me quite a few ways to improve my life that are directly actionable and a new way to think about why I am making healthy choices in my life and for that I am happy and am glad that I read this book. "
61,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1011314-nicole,4,"If you’ve head about “telomeres,” this book does a great job explaining what they are and why you should care about them. In some ways, the advice is what you’ve been hearing for years - eat healthy foods, exercise regularly, sleep enough, and add in stress-reduction techniques like meditation or Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction. Where this book differs is in making specific recommendations on these categories (and more) and demonstrating how it affects your telomeres. I really like how important they made getting help for anxiety and depression because of its significant effect on telomeres and overall health. Some quibbles - like many self-help books, the recommendations are generally much easier to put into practice if you have a certain degree of privilege. And the authors admit that, discussing how policy makers should address **societal stress reduction** as a public health imperative (it seems stress has the greatest effect on our telomeres). In our current civic climate, that to me seems like something that will have some quarters of the Internet s teaming “SNOWFLAKES!” Additionally, as someone who’s in the midst of a weight-loss regimen, I found the research about the effect of weight loss on metabolism misleading. The book cites a study that looked at contestants from the reality show The Biggest Loser, who were burning 600-700 calories less six years after the show, even after regaining weight. However, when I looked up more details on this, the average metabolic drop for people who’ve lost weight is more like 200 calories less, and may disappear after a year (see this summary of studies https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/w...). I felt like the authors had a dislike of dieting and wanted to find research that supported their conclusions. I think that they should have used the science that they were more familiar with, because discouraging people from losing weight isn’t helpful in a society where 70% of people are likely to be overweight or obese at some point in their lives. Overall, worth a read, and I’m glad to have the paper book to have as a reference for some of the practices I’d like to implement. "
62,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7870623-afreen-aftab,3,"I went into this book thinking it was gonna be more science-oriented but I was wrong. The fact that the co-author is a psychologist did seem interesting to me in the beginning because I read this book purely for the genetic aspects and I must admit it was a little disappointing. Genetics does have a deep influence on every field of medicine. Even my Master's degree in Genetics included a paper on psychology. And that's why I decided to finish reading this bookI've always found the science of telomeres interesting and the book provides some great insight into how the cell works and how our choices can affect our life and the process of aging. Although it doesn't really provide any new information on how to live life except from the vantage point of telomeres. Like the fact that eating good food, avoiding stress, good parenting, good relationships, reducing stress, good society, etc etc are pointers towards a longer and healthier life is something I can read in any self-help book. The book gives some really solid tips, I won't lie. Its all-encompassing guide to good living. That is provided you have the money for it, the ability to follow all the suggestions and most of all.. if your genes allow it! I mean you could follow every advice in the book down to a tee and still not live a good life because of things like socio-economic conditions and your inherent genetics. It would probably help those people who really reeeaaaally want a scientific backing on lifestyles choices but other than that I wouldn't recommend this book. Also, stressing about lifestyle choices can also reduce the quality of your life which the book mentions as well, so thanks for that.They have tried to address every aspect of living, pointing out the problems of racism, abuse etc and I do commend them for that. The book has some great sources and references all put together in a handy book and the writers have done an incredible amount of research. There are some nice tips to a better life but like anything too much or too little can be bad and you can follow them if you want you but it all comes down to just trying to live life as best as you possibly can in the current circumstances."
63,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13417829-john-mccullough,5,"I am not a big reader of self-help books and this book falls into that category, more or less. BUT – this book is different. We have known for years, perhaps centuries, that living in a moderate and rational way will lead to better health, happiness and longer life. It has only been within the last 100 years that science has shown us better ways to accomplish these goals, and now how to measure it quantitatively by measuring telomere length.Telomeres, discovered by author Elizabeth Blackburn, are strings of DNA and polypeptides found on the ends of our chromosomes that buffer the processes of cell division. They are longest at birth and shorten over our lifetimes as “life” takes its toll on us and serve as a reasonably accurate index of overall relative aging. This process of loss can be accelerated by stresses of various sorts, curtailed or even reversed, depending upon whether the stress is moderate or severe. Moderate stress is actually good for us, but severe, repeated, or chronic stress prematurely shortens the telomeres and thus shortens our lives and the happiness that may bring. The process is complex and involves proper nutrition, shielding of toxins, good social and community conditions and attitudes.I liked the book for several reasons. It is well written by THE expert in the field – Blackburn was awarded a Nobel Prize for the discovery – and her frequent collaborator, Elissa Epel. The evidence is laid out in a systematic and understandable way with most of the pertinent and important supporting articles actually referenced in the back so the reader can decide whether the findings are relevant and acceptable science. There are also helpful sections if you would like to put into your own life some of the suggestions for good health found in the book. Last, there are URL references for some of the good ideas.The book is worth reading and re-reading if you want to do your best to see your grandchildren marry and have their own children."

It started off strong - lots of biologic science, but developed almost into social science. It appears that they have conducted a very strong systematic review of the literature, but I think they imply a lot more than is known. They do try to highlight this, where the direction of relationships between telomere length and an exposure is unknown (like depression and telomere length), but the book is full of correlations and evidence that ""appears"" to say...Telomerase is the enzyme responsible for restoring the DNA lost during cell divisions. I thought the did a great job of documenting and explaining the consequences of people without properly functioning telomerase. I was surprised to learn how early their research (1980's) began. I remember when I took genetics in 2004, the books didn't recognize the full potential impact.However, after the first 70 pages, they turn to examining the evidence for lengthening telomeres and increasing telomerase activity. They are extensive and cover as much as they feel confident. This article does a great job of explaining why I tend to be critical of many of their statements: http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/12/12/... - Beware the Man of One Study. I find that most of the people talking about juvenescence state outright that traditional statistical methods of measuring associations can't be applied. They (I'm thinking of Dr. Peter Attia) make the argument (probably correctly) that we won't be able to measure associations in this area as firmly as we would like and will have to rely on what makes sense based on the totality of evidence. Anyway, that later 3/4 of the book is probably helpful, but I'm not sure the correlations are related to causality (as in a healthy diet will result in longer telomeres, maybe people who are willing to eat such foods do so because they have longer telomeres).

The first half was far more interesting to read, as it explained how telomeres and telomerase function in your body and what happens when we cause damage to them. The rest of the book followed what most reputable scientists and nutritionists recommend which is to, eat real foods, stay away from sugar, exercise moderately (although they did say extreme exercise shows no damage to your telomeres unless you have over-exercising fatigue syndrome, which was validating to read), meditate, practice mindfullness, unitask, get 7 hours sleep, stay away from harmful toxins (heavy metals, pesticides, etc...), have a strong support system and an environment you feel safe in, stay postive.....basically do all the things, wvery day, and try not to strees out over them (which is laughable and usually a stressor in itself). The book tried to tell me, like many before it, that I am a pessimist and my telemores are probably short but I am not supposed to let that upset me or stress me out because then my telemores will only be shorter ( read: no pressure just change your personality, forget all past life experience, and look on the bright side quick or you're gonna die sooner).

Telomeres are the repeating bits at the end of our DNA that protect the DNA during replications. The shorter our telomeres, the older our cells. Older cells don’t work as effectively for thing like fighting off disease. Stress also has a notable impact on telomere length. More stress, shorter telomeres. Or at least more negative impacts of stressful situations, the shorter the telomeres. Our attitude to stress is important. Seeing the situation as a challenge instead of a threat protects our telomeres. Pessimism, especially hostile pessimism has a devastating effect on our telomeres.Telomeres also show our activity level. Endurance exercise and interval training both lengthen telomeres, and improve our immune system and longevity. Healthy eating and good sleep also help our telomeres. And our telomere length at birth is directly related to our parents, especially mothers telomere length when we were conceived. The mental state and health state of parents have a direct, permanent impact on a child. The book summarizes a large number of studies, a good chunk will turn out to be non-replicable, but still a lot of interesting information here.

After a brief introduction on the nature of telomeres and telomerase, which could have gone much deeper, the book devolves into a typical self help, positive psychology lesson covering topics that have been elucidated much better in other books. If you are new to the genre it is a helpful collection of suggestions. If you listen to health and wellness podcasts, read up on current nutritional and biomedical science breakthroughs, are a fan of functional medicine, etc. then the scholarship comes off as pretty light weight i.e. they advocate the Mediterranean Diet - really? That is straight out of the 1990's. Ancel Keys has been getting bashed for years. Why is there no mention of the ketogenic, GAPS, low FODMAP, or bone broth diets? Where are the references to intermittent fasting? They mention the suprachiasmatic nucleus - and somehow never get into the topic of blue light toxicity. Where is the discussion on the toxic effects of EMF exposure? And you don't need cognitive behavioral therapy to get over food cravings. Becoming fat adapted fixes the problem. Overall it's a missed opportunity to make a real contribution which will have to come from future books. "

The first part of the book is a fairly decent, extremely accessible explanation of how telomeres and telomerase relate to aging. The authors then provide some information about how to hopefully improve the health of your telomeres. So in case it never occurred to you before, if you are currently living like Charlie Sheen, you may want to rein yourself in a bit. Benefits include longer telomeres and looking somewhat less like something the cat dragged in. Your welcome. In all seriousness, though, the book basically rehashes all advice ever given about taking good care of yourself (sleep well, avoid negative stress, and >>ideally<< transform yourself into a middle class white person), and simply calls these things ""good for your telomeres"" instead of ""good for your health.""While I'm sure the authors have plenty to say on this topic, they didn't exactly use this book as their opportunity to share it with the rest of us. I would have enjoyed hearing more about current research, and for me the highlight of the book was actually the discussion of telomere disorders and how they affect patients. "

Learning that I can minimize the disease phase was critical because the last thing I want to do is spend too long in the disease phase of life (...for me, hit me with sickness and then put me in the ground. Make it quick)! There comes a point where health science books seem to reiterate ideas. I have a tendency to start losing interest because conceptually there are three components of long term health: physical health (cardiovascular and muscular), mental health (mindfulness, meditation, engaging in activities that require thinking) and community health (interpersonal and community relationships). If we pay attention to these three forms of health, then we are honoring most of what modern health research suggests. In this book, there appeared to be some deeper understanding of each form of health, including practices that have a greater impact on telomeres. For me, that means continuing cardiovascular health and strengthening my social relationships. "

Errr. Anyway, I thought it was interesting because I love the fascinating science behind it all, and I do find that understanding at a cellular level what's going on in your body IS motivating to eat healthier, sleep more, etc. I read some other reviews that complained that this book had nothing to add to a huge slew of other self-help books, which is most likely true. I usually don't read self-help books though, so I liked the one chapter summation of why sleep is important and another chapter on eating less sugar. And while yes, I already knew those things, again, knowing why at a cellular level and what research was done is motivating, and honestly I don't want to read an entire self-help book on each of the topics discussed. One chapter was plenty. I also liked how the authors provided little ""labs"" that summed up how you could put the research into practice in your own life. But I had a hard time finishing it after I finished my quilt and overall it was pretty much stuff I already knew (besides the science behind it all--which was surprisingly a small part of the book.)"

This is a comprehensive look at achieving healthier telomeres. It goes beyond exercise, and diet, into sleep hygiene, healthy v. unhealthy orientation to stress, chronic anxiety/stress, etc. In this respect, it was a sort of personal checkup for me. Also covered is epigenetics, and the effects of chronic uncontrollable traumatic stress that gets passed from one generation to the next--and even the next. Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are referenced here. Suggestions for personal telomere health, and how to help children have better health is included. If you work in a school setting in a high-poverty area, and/or one hit heavily by the opioid crisis, this helps in understanding a lot. It's a useful book for someone who is at yet fairly unfamiliar with the role of trauma, and its effect on physical and mental health and lifetime outcomes. If you are familiar with all that, it's still good in that we get a telomere snapshot of something specific happening inside our bodies. Glad I read it, both professionally, and personally on the occasion of a big birthday year. "

Telomeres are the caps at the end of each strand of DNA that protect our chromosomes, like the plastic tips at the end of shoelaces, and they, like shoelaces, keep the DNA from unraveling and breaking apart. The longer telomeres you have, your DNA won't unravel as fast as someone with shorter telomeres. Longer telomeres = longer life, shorter telomeres = shorter life. The authors describe in detail what contributes to longer or shorter telomeres, which, like many health-based books will tell you, is altered by what you eat, how you handle stress and your general level of emotional intelligence, how much you exercise, how much exposure you have to chemical toxins, your social connections, and what genes were passed to you.I thoroughly enjoyed this book, it went by fast. Though the information on how to improve your telomere health is the same as how to improve your overall physical, mental, and social health that you read in other health books or articles, this research starts at the genetic level, from the ground up."

The book is for a general audience and explains the material in an easy to understand way. Overall, I think the book is very good - a must read for anyone interested in living a healthy lifestyle.I listened to the audio book version. The audio book was fine, but I plan to get an ebook version to go back and look over some of the sections in more detail. Also, I found it tedious to have the narrator read off all the questionnaires and list off web addresses. If I'm on a walk and listening to the book, I'm not in a position to take a questionnaire. I just want to listen to the text portion, then go back later a do the questionnaire.

Some self help books have the tendency to make you feel guilty for eating bad, not exercising, etc. I liked how this book took the perspectives of both a biologist and a psychologist. It gives you two scientific perspectives that are both valuable for telling the full story of telomeres. Cons: This book felt a little too self help for me. I expected more elaboration of experiments and more biomolecular bases in their analyses. However, this book is written for the public, so I understand omitting these forest details. I feel like I expected more of an evolutionary basis for the reason for telomeres, a history of the discovery of telomeres, and more into how long we telomeres can cause certain forms of cancers. I felt like the scientific aspect of this book was cut short. Overall, three stars seems suitable. Interesting enough to keep the reader reading, but not enough to quench the thirst of a scientific mind. "

The book, for all intents and purposes could have been simplified into the following: Telomeres protect your DNA, which slows aging, you should therefore protect your telomeres by practicing good health. Thats it, just be healthy. None of the information on health was ""revolutionary"" as was touted in the original title, which has thankfully been changed, nor is it ""new"" as the book now claims. The science, though interesting, was fairly sparse throughout the book, and the authors seemed to confuse correlation and causation in nearly every chapter. Not a terrible book, but for a much better, briefer, and frankly more entertaining description of telomeres, I would recommend episode #502 and #1054 of the Joe Rogan Experience podcast. "

It was written in an easy to read manner, despite the scientific explanations. Most of the diagrams were not helpful, but maybe because I found them too simple. It was written by Nobel Prize Winner, Elizabeth Blackburn, PhD and Health Psychologist, Elissa Epel, PhD. They were not simply regurgitating what they had read, they did the work. I feel empowered by the information and recommendations these women shared. I recommend this book"

It explains the ""why"" behind nutrition, stress reduction, mindfulness, physical activity, mental acuity, and sleep to lead to better health-span outcomes. I deducted one star because this book spent a significant amount of time trying to sell the reader on telomeres while constantly dangling teasers. If you are reading the book I think you are pretty much on board. I deducted a second star because the book did not really advance any of the underlying fields, it simply summed them up. If you have already read on those topics and internalized the lessons, there is not much that you will do differently."

I guess I just got out of it what I've already read and known via Google, personal experience, and observation: living younger, healthier, and longer (notwithstanding being involved in an accident, etc.) is based on your genes + your environment + your own actions (eating healthy v. eating crap, brushing your teeth v. not brushing your teeth, running v. sitting on a couch all day, smoking v. not smoking, etc.).

A lot of the advice given is kind of common sense and what I’ve read in a lot of other books on wellness, but it’s interesting and valuable to see the benefit of such habits on the biomolecular level, which I suppose is the whole point of the book, and some results of the studies did surprise me. All-in-all the book serves its purpose without necessarily saying anything groundbrakingly new in terms of what to do on a day to day basis, but that’s coming from someone who’s read a lot of popular lit on the matter.

As such, there wasn’t anything really new here, just very good and clear advice on living a healthy and long life. Great book for learning what you’re doing right, areas you need to work on and how to proceed/get started. Also great if you need more convincing for why you need to kick that bad habit."

The research in this book is valid and easily applicable without being preachy.

I was also concerned by the tone akin to “live longer if you do this one cool trick.” The short story is that telomere health is supported by exercise and eating whole foods, but it felt like sometimes the authors went a little beyond this. I also do not recommend the audio version of this book. There are too many hyperlinks and quizzes to work effectively as an audiobook."

Telomeres are a compound structure at the end of a chromosome. Telomeres get shorter each time a cell copies itself, but the important DNA stays intact. Eventually, telomeres get too short to do their job, causing our cells to stop copying and resulting in cell aging and cell dysfunction. Therefore, telomeres act as the aging clock in every cell. "

A big premise of the book is that mood, attitude, minimization of stress, etc can have a biochemical effect, here in the length of telomeres.

296,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48895924-georgia-bell,4,This book was quite informative. I already follow a lot of what was recommended for eating but think this would help others change their eating habits. I found the book written so that anyone could understand what was being explained. I would recommend it to any person who wants to help their body remain strong as they age.

When the cell divides, it gets shorter. Over a period of time it gets so short it can't protect the chromosome. So the cell loses its ability to reproduce and you age.But, guess what? You can do stuff to prevent the telomere from shrinking! Then you don't age so fast. Does it work? Hell if I know---too late!"

Although this book covers a few different topics including aging, I was especially interested in the information related to stress and anxiety. "
