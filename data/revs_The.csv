0,The,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38612248-chris-harris,5,"An absolute delight. The good-humoured nature of the radio show translates easily to print, and Robin and Brian manage to start bickering through the medium of footnotes almost immediately. This is a joyful and enthusiastic celebration of science that will present you with all sorts of thought-provoking material, such as explaining how the observable universe, whilst only being 13.8 billion years old, manages to be currently some 93 billion light years across. And yes, the question of whether strawberries ever die rumbles on..."
1,The,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3075378-erin,5,"There were times this made my eyes cross. But it was really really funny, and I wish I remembered all the really good quotes so that I could throw them in this review.Yes, I am a Prof Brian Cox fan, so listening to his dulcet tones was quite enjoyable. The other cohort was a bit more brash, and I found myself turning the audio down a bit because it was too jarring compared to Brian.It brought a tear to my eye finishing listening to this on the day Professor Stephen Hawking died, especially as they quoted him in this.Also, reading this on Pie day was amusing.I wish this was a better review than it is, because it deserves much more. All I can say is I really enjoyed it."
2,The,http://goodreads.com/user/show/919308-simon,4,"I love science and knowledge and I love people who can bring life and energy to complex subjects. Brian Cox does this. I can't say I understand everything but every time I read a book like this I learn a bit more although it does lead to more questions and thoughts. It's also a saddening book at times when they discuss the issues of science being doubted, maligned and rejected. Overall, if you've got an inquisitive mind then this is well worth your time."
3,The,http://goodreads.com/user/show/97475594-a-gin-and-orange-a-lemon-squash-and-a-scotch-and-water-please,5,"Much like the universe I've just built in the cellar, this book is infinitely enjoyable* and highly illuminating. Until the very end, that is, when the meter ran out and everything went dark. Or it ripped itself apart. Or it collapsed in on itself and, page by page, disappeared up its own semi-colon. To be honest, I don't know what's happened, it's too dark to see anything. And cold. Alternatively, I could be sitting in the freezer.*enjoyable because I understood almost everything (sometimes after reading chapters more than once), such is the quality and clarity of the explanation.Still blew my mind though. Happily."
4,The,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3755486-melinda,5,"If you are a fan of Brian Cox, and you havent listened to him doing the Infinite Monkey Cage series - you should. And if you are a fan and you are already enthralled with Infinite Monkey Cage series - then you should know how much of a hoot this book is going to be!!! Physics, humour, questions, craziness - all wrapped up for the dedicated non-science lay person. Good stuff."
5,The,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19940889-umbar,4,I prefer the podcast more (I think the format works better for simplifying concepts and jokes land better) but this was nonetheless an entertaining read and I finish the book feeling like I have learned a lot.
6,The,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22778865-g-r-matthews,5,"I really enjoyed this book. So much so that I've decided to leave my current employment and attend university to get my BSc and then Phd in particle physics... might have to study maths a bit first, but I am sure it will be fine!The whole thing is written in engaging prose and simple enough that even I understood some of it... might need to read it all a few times more to truly grasp a few more bits."
7,The,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42028968-nicola,5,"I’ve read this book twice and listened to the audiobook (which I recommend you do even if you’ve read the book as well as it’s just brilliant) and it only gets better the more times I read it. I love the infinite monkey cage podcasts so when I found they had a book, it was a must buy. All lovers of this amazing podcast definitely need this book! And all those who are just interested in how to build a universe, from infinity to the eventual doom of our universe and more. And of course the discussion into dead strawberries which OG lovers of the show will understand all too well. I love books like these that can disseminate science in an interesting, understandable and engaging way. It isn’t a boring yawn reeling of facts and information but delivered in a way that’s informative but interesting and you can learn a lot. Brian and Robin are such a fantastic duo and this book really cannot be rivalled for its mix of hardcore science and hilariously funny comedy. Really is such an enjoyable book!"
8,The,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5124380-michael-legge,5,Shame he dies in the end. 
9,The,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8077845-simon-fletcher,3,An enjoyable lark of a read. Great for dipping in and out of. Ince provides the light relief to Cox's sometimes ponderous text.
10,The,http://goodreads.com/user/show/104039601-vaughan-hatton,4,"I was going to rate this book lower, until I came to the chapter where Brian and Robin remind me that, sometimes these books aren't meant to be page turners. They should make you scratch your chin and tilt your head ever so slightly. They should make you stop and think and apply what is being talked about to your everyday life. In the end I did enjoy this book."
11,The,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1740824-jo,3,I try to read something sciency every now and again because it's not a subject I'm terribly good with and I hope to attempt to educate myself. This was a great book for doing that although some of the particle physics went over my head. 
12,The,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11562142-jahnavi-jha,5,I want to give this book a billion stars! At this point in my life I have been reminded through this book about why I adore science and technology. Reminded me of when I was a child and I wanted to be an astronaut. Can hardly wait for the next part. 
13,The,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2968290-robin,4,I really enjoyed this book
14,The,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43153302-vanessarc,4,"It's a collection of snippets regarding different science topics seen or analized from different lenses. It may not be groundbreaking, but it brings the user closer to several different topics and laws of physics and chemistry while being very amusing and easy to follow. It's a fast and nice read."
15,The,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20675768-kristina,5,"I found this via Ricky Gervais's Deadly Sirius podcast when Robin plugged it. Luckily my library had a copy on the Libby app so I was able to borrow it. I didn't even realise there was a radio show (currently working my way through that now!). Anyway, brilliant book for non expert's and general science fans like myself. Much easier to understand than some of the other astrophysics books I've read recently. Wish I'd started with this one but as Robin points out you can't just read one astrophysics book and expect to be an expert, you just need to read them and eventually it will start to make more sense!"
16,The,http://goodreads.com/user/show/55137572-aimee,3,"I love podcasts and I'm a sucker for those inevitable Christmas tie-in books, especially if (like this one) they are available as audiobooks. This one was a lot more dry than usual IMC episodes though, especially the section on building a universe which was hard to follow (to be fair I tend to listen to books while driving so I wasn't giving it my full attention). Overall though it was good, with some interesting details of behind-the-scenes physics arguments between Brian and Robin."
17,The,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72099172-bob-small,5,"Fun, 'formative. It contains a great round up of the cold/hot big bang model and how all the evidence interlocks. I read most of it sitting on the beach at Durdle Door, in the warm sunshine. What a day... But the poor strawberry...."
18,The,http://goodreads.com/user/show/95275485-raph,5,A hilarious read. Enjoyed every bit of it and learnt at the same time. This sciencey book was not boring.
19,The,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28011233-rob-frampton,5,"A brilliant distillation of topics from the 'Infinite Monkey Cage' radio series, this may just be the most accessible science book Brian Cox has produced, and that is due in no small part to the back-and-forth-with Robin Ince and the quirky carton-like illustrations that pepper the text. It balances the serious with the humorous to compelling effect. ""Life, Death and Strawberries"" is both entertaining and enlightening about what constitutes being alive,and the section which dismantles homeopathy is a must-read. ""We are often less comfortable with evidence-based scrutiny than with a pleasing anecdote that lends credence to our preconceived views on what we wish something to be."" It's not all fun, though, and the chapter on cosmology makes for difficult reading because, let's be honest, to properly understand the subject you'll need better maths than most of have got. That's not to say it's not worth reading, and I'll definitely be going back to it to prise out some more detail, but it's definitely mind stretching stuff. It does, however, contain m favourite quotation from the book: ""We are temporary assemblies of ten billion billion billion atoms, and in a century or less they will all be returned for recycling. But for the briefest of moments these atoms are able to contemplate themselves... Our purpose should be to extend their moment in the light as best we can"", which is almost Sagan-like in its beauty.The book ends with a cartoon landscape 'Guide to the Year 2050', of which the highlight is, ""Social media has been replaced by a small and aggressive robot that perpetually screams abuse at you."" I don't want to criticise, Brian and Robin, but I think we're already there..."
20,The,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67633405-margherita-serafini,5,"This is an open-mindingly incredible book about our universe and how it works in its very detailed (yet simplified) theories, fascinating curiosities and original ideas on how to percieve a universe full of question marks and unknown faces. It is so weird yet curious how little we know about what surrounds us and still manage to discover more and more though time. How can something come out of nothing? This is what fascinates me most and pushed me further deep into the reading as I was kind of struggling in the middle paragraph. The great thing about it is its incredible power to inspire deeper research and plant curiosity into the minds of its readers. It was definitely a bit of a challenge for me to read since it was my first scientific read ever, but it inspired me to keep reading and looking for answers whether that is in books or in unbeaten paths discovering new theories and possibly getting progressively closer to the truth, taking one step closer to discovering a future of endless possibilities for our species and many others and for the discovering of places and life into the apparently dark and cold space that surrounds us. It inspired me to keep looking and fighting to contribute in the helping of future generations and species as well as it made me deeply interested in physics, astrophysics and cosmology pushing me to keep studying them as they might be what I want to pursue as a life carreer. I would definitely reccommend though language is not quite easy at first. I personally loved it. It completely changed my perspective of the world and made me consider everything in a ore methodic, scientific way. "
21,The,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76288119-matthew-abbott,4,"Fans of The Infinite Monkey Cage will be already familiar with the dream team Ince and Cox's approach to talking about science, and How To Build A Universe is no exception. This book sees the pair concentrating on the fundamentals that build up our known universe and some of the mechanics that make it function as we know it does. Dealing with high level equations, theories and concepts at times I felt a little overwhelmed by the sheer scale of everything that can be understood, let only simply just theorised, yet ince's witty intermissions, the charming artwork and the comic strips all help break it up into more manageable chunks. Rather than teach you the fundamentals, I think what the book really sets out to do and achieves is to make the reader appreciate the complexity, beauty and sheer scale of the universe. At one point Ince states something along the lines of ""don't expect to understand science after reading one book, it took the scientist that wrote it 20 years to form those ideas and theories"" and that is exactly true, but if you've got an interest or would like to be interested, you could do far worse than starting here. What we have here is an introduction to beginning to understand some of the big picture, from the hot big bang and the expansion of the universe, to parallel worlds and multiverse theory and many other things besides. If you'd like a more accessible overview into some of these things I can't recommend this book highly enough, as Cox and Ince work and apparently write really well together and have created a really interesting, informative and accessible book. "
22,The,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4968342-tyson-adams,5,"I'm going to bake some chocolate muffins from scratch, so this book should be useful.Professor Brian Cox, Robin Ince, and Alexandra 'Sasha' Feachem are the team behind the popular The Infinite Monkey Cage, a BBC science show that pairs scientists and comedians for laughs and education. From 2009 they have produced +100 shows covering all sorts of topics. This book encapsulates some highlights and essays around their favourite topics and common science communication issues* they have covered in that time. From the opening forewards to the covering of Schrodinger's Strawberry I was heartily entertained. As a science nerd and fan of comedy, this book seems to have been written specifically for me. It actually left me feeling a bit annoyed that I haven't, as yet, listened to The Infinite Monkey Cage show, despite having been aware of it for quite some time. So I guess I'll be rectifying that soon.What I like most about this approach to science is that it doesn't seek to sex up science (or dumb down, depending upon the preferred flavour of marketing), but instead make it accessible and entertaining. There is a line between those two that too often those in the media can't tell the difference between. Science is interesting, but it is complicated, it is often dry, and communicating scientific knowledge as done here is hard to do. * Yes, I do mean how people aren't willing to honestly engage with science, either through pseudoscience co-opting, or denial of evidence, or wanting certainty instead of the probability that science offers."
23,The,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20351361-john-tetteroo,4,"I like the programme on podcast and by chance my ex bought this book for my birthday. She knows me so well ;). I think it is a nice way of presenting intense science to the greater public, enhancing it with comedy to sweeten the often bitter dryness of the subject matter. At first the oftentimes childish humour gave me some apprehension to read on, thinking this was rather a book meant for fourteen year old boys, instead of an ageing gentleman of serious inclination (ahum). The reverence Robin holds for the oh so intelligent and not to forget flashy pop star professor Brian is bordering on the verge of grovelling, even at times self-deprecating. This makes for sympathetic humour at times, but gets old rapidly, finding me annoyed with Brian for playing along.Looking past these slight irritations there is thought provoking material in this book that provoked me to.. well.. think some things over. In that respect they succeed marvellously. following the theme of building a universe they lead us along the big questions, stuff we did find out and the even greater questions that arise from finding stuff out. It is all about zombie strawberries and infinite cages that make you ponder the finiteness of our monkeyism.. or something. I can recommend this book to everyone who has even a passing interest in philosophizing about the nature of being, and to fourteen year old boys interested in scientific standup comedy. "
24,The,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15240416-colin-murtagh,4,"I love the radio show, I’m just not overly sure about the book. The radio show normally takes a topic, and with the help of guests tries to explain it. With Robin Ince there partially as an ""everyman"" character and partially to lighten the load with a touch of humour. I'm not so sure this works so well in book format. There's several sections, looking at what death is, difficult to know if you're a strawberry, infinity, cosmology, thermodynamics, quantum mechanics, and space exploration amongst other things. The actual written parts themselves are clearly explained, although some prior knowledge would help, never getting to the stage where it feels like a text book. It's interesting, well written, and has a few humorous side conversations going on. The issue I have is more of the formatting. I'm actually quite pleased I read this as a paper book as opposed to a kindle. There's lots of little doodles throughout the book, which are quite fun, hovere there's also a lot of strange formatting and weird page layouts. Pages with one large font sentence printed sideways for example. It is heavily illustrated, but not all the illustrations work, and on a kindle will probably look really awkward. It's a brave experiment but just doesn't work.Saying that, if you're looking for what a popular science book should read like, you can't go too far wrong with this."
25,The,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10252932-howard,3," I guess when you are trying to popularise science, you inevitably end up dumbing down the method of delivery, if not the actual science. I picked this book up on a whim at a bookstore, and I guess a glance through the book would have made me put it down again, but it was in a plastic wrap so I bought it based on the back cover blurb alone.Anyway, bits of it were interesting and some less so. It seems a pretty commercial enterprise and comes across as anything other than a serious book on science. But I guess if it gets just a few kids interested enough in cosmology to take it up as an academic challenge it will have done a good job.But for me all the doodles and other peripheral illustrations were rather off putting, and the folksy humour permeating the book did nothing to endear me further."
26,The,http://goodreads.com/user/show/81357706-phuong-ha-pham,3,"The book covers some big topics, from dark matter, the Big Bang, brain science to artificial intelligent and even extraterrestrial life. It is a spinoff of the BBC Radio 4 The Infinite Monkey Cage and is a celebration (sometimes in an irreverent way, because of humours of course) of what science has achieved.Tbh, it took ages to finish this book but ironically I could only grasp some parts of it and absolutely lost connection with what was being said in some other. Given this was the first book of this genre I've read, I shouldn't have raised the bar too high. I found the chapter on Robin's thoughts reassuring and made me feel less stupid. Overall, not a great book for someone who gets back to reading science after many years since they left school, but still there are some gems in there. I may check out the show and come back to the book later, who know."
27,The,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8291749-andrew-rangel,5,"It sounds a bit square of me, but I almost didn’t buy this book because I saw that it had pictures in it. I can’t help but chuckle at the thought after reading this magnificent book, but I like something that has more substance. How to build a universe delivered the whole package. In it you will find bit sized anecdotes that are almost too good not to share with friends, alongside deep and meaningful discussions about the core of science. I couldn’t recommend this book more to someone that is a non fiction reader looking for a light hearted spin around the science world. I have had zero experience with their podcast and that didn’t limit the book at all for me. "
28,The,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18158124-jim-mann,5,"The Infinite Monkey Cage is one of my favorite podcasts (of a BBC radio production). If features physicist Brian Cox and comedian Robin Ince and a changing panel of three (usually two scientists and a third person who may be a comedian, an actor or someone like Alan Moore). The theme song was written by Eric Idle (who turns out to be a science geek, as is actor Brian Blessed, someone else who's visited the show multiple times). Now Brian and Robin have written a book that contains some real science but at the same time captures the feel of the show. Recommended to fans of the show and to others interested in science (and if you aren't already listening to, you should be.)"
29,The,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44192262-marles-henry,5,"Alas, I wish I tried harder in maths and science. Brian Cox has a great knack of explaining the unexplainable like our universe space and time and all that wibbly wobbly stuff. I really enjoyed this little book - was a good little snapshot into our little world out there in the big universe. Still totally confused about what's out there but it's people like Brian Cox who make it more interesting and make us realise that there is just so much more that we don't know. I am just in awe of this unknown."
30,The,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36686872-justin-harnish,4,"A good read for someone that wants a laugh alongside their deep thoughts about existence. Brian Cox does a great job of laying out the Standard Model in layman's terms, discussing the ROI of the NASA Apollo Missions, the moral and evolutionary reasons for colonizing Mars, and the failure of our current politics to combat the existential threat of our great filter. At once funny and informative, ""How to Build a Universe"" is a good addition to any physics and philosophy library, especially if you enjoy the ""Infinite Monkey Cage Podcast."""
31,The,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39270567-leo,4,"I'm a fan of the various programs Brain Cox has been part of, and heard a few of the Infinite Monkey Cage podcasts episodes, so when I saw they had a book, figure what the heck. I'm not sure what I can say about this book, outside of it was interesting. It basically reads like a literal transcript of one of their shows. Chaotic, witty, and jammed packs of sciencey stuff. Overall, I was pleased with the book and would have no issues recommending it to others."
32,The,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8817460-richard,2,"Disappointing, consigned to the 'abandoned' bookshelf after about 40 pages (and subsequently the local charity shop). Instead of publishing a readable popular science book, you have one that tries (and fails) to recreate the humour of Radio 4's highly entertaining radio show/podcast 'The Infinite Monkey Cage'. As such, you're left with a fragmented experience which fails to convey the humour and anecedotal nature of the show."
33,The,http://goodreads.com/user/show/78945623-alan-newton,5,"(Audible) An excellent science audiobook (book), based on the BBC Radio 4 programme 'The Infinite Monkey Cage' hosted by Cox and Ince. Funny and good humoured, with some interesting metaphors for understanding complex topics, helping me understand - at least momentarily - some theories I've read several times before but have failed to register! Ha."
34,The,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16235933-jonathan,3,"This is a very approachable book. My instinct tells me that this is down largely to the easily accessible format of The Infinite Monkey Cage and probably Robin Ince. I have read a number of Brian Cox's other books and as a verbal communicator he is excellent, if irritating at times, as an author his works are hard to get into."
35,The,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4482895-shabbeer-hassan,3,"To start off I'd say the radio show/podcast, is way better than this book format. Frankly speaking, the humour-laden spontaneity of Ince and dulcet tonal factual answers by Cox are what makes the Infinite Monkey Cage such a great show, which loses its sheen when translated into a static book format.Nevertheless, an interesting book containing some mind-boggling tidbits.My Rating -3/5"
36,The,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26482946-morag,4,"Really enjoyed this. Serious science delivered with a huge dollop of inspiration and lightness of touch. Don’t tell Brian, but it even ‘boldly goes’ into the realms of philosophy with an approach to how to find validity as an individual thinking being on a small blue dot in a vast universe. (Yes, Brian. you did!) "
37,The,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4115861-michael-heath-caldwell,5,"Some of these books I may need to read twice to get what they are on about. Prof. Brian Cox and Robin Ince go over a lot of science, with a lot of mind-map diagrams and sketches, showing what is theory, what is evidence and thus, what is fact, about the universe, which was quite interesting, while avoiding the helpful theories expounded by Jim Al-Khalili, two desks down from them in the BBC. "
38,The,http://goodreads.com/user/show/89817654-m-g-knight,5,Great companion to an extraordinary radio series. Two distinct voices with quite differing perspectives on unfathomably vast topics.

39,The,http://goodreads.com/user/show/108170424-lillian-salt,5,"As someone without a degree in particle physics, it was a great surprise that I actually managed to follow most of this book. Yes there are some moments when you regret even starting it because it’s 2am and you still don’t understand string theory, it is all worth it.

It has the humour from the show that I love, and I really liked how Robin and Brian's back and forth banter played out across the pages. I thought they handled the balance of Brian's in-depth technical science with Robin's questions and musings really well."
41,The,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20298116-philip-berghan-whyman,3,"Love the podcast. The book felt a bit shallow.

242,The,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8817460-richard,2,"Disappointing, consigned to the 'abandoned' bookshelf after about 40 pages (and subsequently the local charity shop). Instead of publishing a readable popular science book, you have one that tries (and fails) to recreate the humour of Radio 4's highly entertaining radio show/podcast 'The Infinite Monkey Cage'. As such, you're left with a fragmented experience which fails to convey the humour and anecedotal nature of the show."
243,The,http://goodreads.com/user/show/78945623-alan-newton,5,"(Audible) An excellent science audiobook (book), based on the BBC Radio 4 programme 'The Infinite Monkey Cage' hosted by Cox and Ince. Funny and good humoured, with some interesting metaphors for understanding complex topics, helping me understand - at least momentarily - some theories I've read several times before but have failed to register! Ha."
244,The,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16235933-jonathan,3,"This is a very approachable book. My instinct tells me that this is down largely to the easily accessible format of The Infinite Monkey Cage and probably Robin Ince. I have read a number of Brian Cox's other books and as a verbal communicator he is excellent, if irritating at times, as an author his works are hard to get into."
245,The,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4482895-shabbeer-hassan,3,"To start off I'd say the radio show/podcast, is way better than this book format. Frankly speaking, the humour-laden spontaneity of Ince and dulcet tonal factual answers by Cox are what makes the Infinite Monkey Cage such a great show, which loses its sheen when translated into a static book format.Nevertheless, an interesting book containing some mind-boggling tidbits.My Rating -3/5"
246,The,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26482946-morag,4,"Really enjoyed this. Serious science delivered with a huge dollop of inspiration and lightness of touch. Don’t tell Brian, but it even ‘boldly goes’ into the realms of philosophy with an approach to how to find validity as an individual thinking being on a small blue dot in a vast universe. (Yes, Brian. you did!) "
247,The,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4115861-michael-heath-caldwell,5,"Some of these books I may need to read twice to get what they are on about. Prof. Brian Cox and Robin Ince go over a lot of science, with a lot of mind-map diagrams and sketches, showing what is theory, what is evidence and thus, what is fact, about the universe, which was quite interesting, while avoiding the helpful theories expounded by Jim Al-Khalili, two desks down from them in the BBC. "
248,The,http://goodreads.com/user/show/89817654-m-g-knight,5,Great companion to an extraordinary radio series. Two distinct voices with quite differing perspectives on unfathomably vast topics. Robin Ince sits in nicely for us as the moderately educated everyman to Brian Coxs' wonder filled savant.Inspired a new approach to something for me - so value added all the way!
249,The,http://goodreads.com/user/show/108170424-lillian-salt,5,"As someone without a degree in particle physics, it was a great surprise that I actually managed to follow most of this book. Yes there are some moments when you regret even starting it because it’s 2am and you still don’t understand string theory, it is all worth it. The book is an absolute triumph and a most read for someone with even an atom of interest in science!"
250,The,http://goodreads.com/user/show/100267590-g-hayden,5,"I love the podcast so I was really excited to read this book and it did not disappoint! It has the humour from the show that I love, and I really liked how Robin and Brian's back and forth banter played out across the pages. I thought they handled the balance of Brian's in-depth technical science with Robin's questions and musings really well."
251,The,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20298116-philip-berghan-whyman,3,"Love the podcast. The book felt a bit shallow.

253,The,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7836547-shaun-mcalister,3,I’m afraid the parts by Cox went right over my head and not in a way I thought I would ever be able to comprehend. The sections by Ince were funny and exactly what I’d expect after seeing several of his live shows. 
254,The,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63240697-gu-mundur,5,"Loved this book. Not often that I am laughing out lout reading a physics book.

Clever, informative and most of all very very funny. "
255,The,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69583302-gadir,5,"Funny and amazing book. It's really entertained and delighted me. I found what I have been looking for in this book - lots of brilliant explanations of scientific theories and myths, well described with visualisations. "
256,The,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4696083-monikat,5,"Always a joy to listen to Robin Ince and Brian Cox explaining the stuff of the universe.

269,The,http://goodreads.com/user/show/84114063-alex,3,Wasn't my favourite book but was still good. 
270,The,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36686872-justin-harnish,4,"A good read for someone that wants a laugh alongside their deep thoughts about existence. Brian Cox does a great job of laying out the Standard Model in layman's terms, discussing the ROI of the NASA Apollo Missions, the moral and evolutionary reasons for colonizing Mars, and the failure of our current politics to combat the existential threat of our great filter. At once funny and informative, ""How to Build a Universe"" is a good addition to any physics and philosophy library, especially if you enjoy the ""Infinite Monkey Cage Podcast."""
