0,0316338923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7961091-a-j-fitzwater,1,"I could not finish this book. I read 1/3 then skimmed the rest.The history is put in such a sexist framework, I felt I was reading creative non-fiction, a script for a movie, or a historical fiction retelling. The focus on the women's attractiveness, romantic affairs, and having babies was not at all appropriate to their scientific contribution and ground breaking achievements in a time when women were excluded from scientific endeavour and the work force. If the book had intended to interrogate the trials of juggling work and family life during political and scientific upheaval, it failed miserably as there was much hand waving towards women's political and legal justice shift. The book fell into a distracting repetition of talking about the women in very dramatic, emotional language for a paragraph or two, then spent pages on dry facts and lauding the men of JPL, often leaving the women out of the experiments. As this was a work place problem, the political implications should have been discussed, but they never were. Similarly, any work place sexual harassment was hand waved and laughed away, as well as being fired for pregnancy - the narrative put the burden upon the women instead of interrogating the problems within the system. What was of interest, the work and massive contribution the women scientists did, was rendered down into very pithy descriptions. The feminist contributions the women did undertake were presented in very ""Lean In"" style, putting no onus on the company itself (childcare? maternal care? community? All created by the women themselves, and did not seem supported by men or the company, yet this was never interrogated). The descriptions of the women, their figures, and clothes were incredibly distracting and sexist, and seemed framed to assure a more conservative reader that ""It's okay lads! They may have sent us into outer space, but they were sexy and popped out babies while they did it, never fear!""I'd give this a half star if I could. The author had no grounding in the feminist/political movements of the time or the hard political yards undertaken by women in these environments."

I did, however, discover it there. Which is still a win, in my book. Because it's one of THE most astonishingly AMAZING, compellingly ENTHRALLING, science/space/history works of non-fiction celebrating women of notoriety - on the PLANET! Before IBM built mainframes, before FORTRAN or BASIC or any other coding language, and long before women were awarded engineering degrees, the ""Rocket Girls"" were performing intricately complex mathematical equations, writing code, manipulating formulas - with pencil and paper, mind you!! - for the designing, constructing, testing, and the launching of rockets and missiles for military purposes and space exploration. Space exploration being their passion. Then when IBM came on the scene, these women were writing code, AND teaching it to their male counterparts - those guys with lambskin awarded engineering degrees. This is their story - the ""Rocket Girls"" of JPL - collectively and individually. And let me just say, Nathalia Holt knocked it out of the park - soaring well over the retaining wall into the outer reaches non-fiction excellence. The time and attention, not to mention care and fortitude, she (and her editing/publishing team) gave to researching, interviewing, exploring, designing, and penning of this unprecedentedly excellent book shows throughout, from cover to cover. In case you couldn't tell, I'm over the moon with this book. So much so, I'm going to buy a copy to send to one of my granddaughters. Though it isn't written for a young adult audience (much of the mathematical and scientific content might be a little heady for tweens, and maybe even for teens) I feel like it's important to expose girls and young women to stories celebrating women who excel in mathematics and science and other non-traditional careers. All the way around, whether or not your interests encompass women's studies, this is a highly recommendable book for anyone who enjoys exemplary works regaling unique history stories, memoirs, science and/or mathematics nuanced non-fiction, and/or space exploration.  FIVE ***** Superbly Amazing - to the NTH DEGREE - Women's History ***** STARS "
2,0316338923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10169502-bethany-fair,2,"I wish I could give this 2.5 stars. While I enjoyed the author's intentions and much of the history, Holt is a lackluster storyteller at best with a tendency to portray her ""rocket girls"" as giddy, impressionable preteens who are more concerned with ""correcting their wind-blown girlish hair"" than they are with representing themselves as agents of their own careers. Every shallow description of ""Barbara's slim A-line skirt"" belies the seriousness with which she hopes the readers will perceive the brilliance and determination of the first women rocket scientists. Why does the author spend so much time undermining her own intentions with superfluous physical descriptions, such as when she stupidly points out that Barbara was ""gaining a lot of weight"" because she was too busy at JPL to eat anything but croissants and milkshakes. Who gives a shit? I do give it 2.5 stars because I do appreciate her methodology and use of oral history as a primary source. Many of the stories were interesting, but she should have given her heroines more agency and respect."
3,0316338923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/477874-heather,4,"This is a fascinating look into the lives of the women who have worked at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory from its inception in the 1940s until today. Despite my interest in NASA and the history of space program, I didn't know much about JPL and was blown away by the stories of the women who were doing such important work at a time when women were not encouraged to have careers at all, much less careers in science. I also thought it was really interesting to learn about how things worked in the initial development of satellites and rockets. It's incredible that all the math was done by hand in those days, and amazing that it was primarily women who were doing the calculations considering the attitude society had about women in science at the time. Nathalia Holt does a wonderful job of weaving the individual women's stories with the details of JPL and the work they were doing there. It makes for a fascinating book that provides a lot of fun information with a human interest element as well. "

The Nancy Drew style of writing put me off, the book wasn't particularly well organized, and I did a lot of skimming of the last 2/3.An important story that should be told. But perhaps by a different author."
5,0316338923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3409532-april-does-feral-sometimes,5,"'Rise of the Rocket Girls' is an excellent read, as well as a well-researched and organized history of the involvement of women 'computers' working for the Jet Propulsion Lab. Nathalia Holt's book left me feeling happy.World War II ushered in a new desire from all combatants for improved weapons of war. All involved governments spent as much money as they could on stocking up on weapons. Missile development was in its infancy before the war had started, but of course, once the war began in earnest, everybody realized what a great weapon a missile would be, especially for the government that first solved the dual problems of launching them and of aiming them accurately at a target once launched. Private hobbyists, universities and governments were sporadically working on missile technology. Even after the war started they had not yet become a cohesive group. Separately at first, groups of scientists and engineers, sometimes simply friends who decided to work together, searched for abandoned warehouses, factories and airfields to do research into building missiles. As their work was literally explosive, they needed places far from human habitats. Some of the men - they were all men initially working more and more officially for the government and for the private companies who formed research laboratories - had girlfriends who also became interested in the work. Luckily for history, a few of the women had been born with the maths gene and so had studied math as a hobby. Not many universities allowed women to enroll in math classes, but a few did. Some women had had fathers who indulged their daughters' interest in math, too. In time, in these early days, a few of the women became accepted as auxiliary members of the teams working on missile development. As certain women rose to leadership roles in the newly formed math calculation department at the Jet Propulsion Lab - women were the best at the work - they began the work on the maths necessary to shoot rockets accurately. These women became known as the computers. Just as designing missiles was all by hand, so was figuring out trajectories. Eventually, machines would take over the work of solving mathematical equations, and these machines would take on the name by which the women's math department had been called - Computers. Eventually, the work changed from missile trajectories to working out how to fly rockets to Mars, Venus, Jupiter and Uranus. Later, the work became how to direct rockets to land a man on the Moon. None of these women hired as computers had engineering degrees (many colleges had rules forbidding women to study engineering), so they were left out a lot by upper management in certain meetings and in being respected. However, lower ranking departmental employees had to be much more involved together in consultation and in the work, so respect slowly grew. The women's salaries was a third to half of what the men earned, although they were doing either the same work or work which was essential to getting rockets off the ground and to landing where they needed to be. And like career women today, they struggled with the events of marriages and child care interfering with their jobs. However, unlike most women today, they were forced to resign after a baby was born, career over.Sigh.The story of the rocket girls is generally a happy one, though. The author explains how the women helped NASA put people and rovers and satellites into space, describing how women were involved from the 1940's to today. She does so through interesting biographies of the women and an easy to understand history of rocket development (no maths for the reader to struggle with). Some of the spectacular successes and failures of rocket history are explained, including information I did not know before. In the back of the book are extensive notes and an index.I highly recommend 'Rise of the Rocket Girls'!"

8,0316338923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2807605-bookworm1858,3,Super fascinating topic to highlight these amazing women; unfortunately I didn't super love the writing style and slogged through this.
9,0316338923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13244359-donna,4,"I've had this one for a while and finally decided to tackle it. I was a little hesitant because it had the potential of being dry, since I'm so not a science geek. But I completely enjoyed this. It was a wonderful read. The women in this book were such great examples not only to all women, but also to the men in their world.This book covers a group of women who were hired by the Jet Propulsion Lab as number crunchers. IBM kept coming up with ginormous calculators to do the math, but they were never reliable, so these women led the way. Often times, they would have to leave their job when they were fired for being pregnant, but they would always come back. I thought the author did a great job and not bogging this down with the scientific details that would mean nothing to me. She kept her focus on the women and their lives, both personal and professional. The computer science details seemed a little to technical for me towards the end, but I was still fascinated with how much they have evolved into what we have today. "
10,0316338923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2459470-lisa-kay,5,"★★★★½ I’m still trying to decide what to rate it (4½ or 4 stars). While I loved it, there was A LOT of physics and math. Not that I haven't taken courses in those subjects. Although, I would have liked a few more diagrams, the author does a pretty good job of conveying what these ladies were doing, which was light years beyond my abilities. I'm very appreciative of what these exceptional young women had to deal with in the 40's, 50's, 60's, 70's and beyond, being more pioneers than radical rebels; they were outstanding in their field and deserve more recognition."
11,0316338923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23100707-jean,5,"I have heard about these women at JPL for years and am so glad to have the opportunity to learn more about them. The Jet Propulsion Lab (JPL) started in the 1930s by a group of male rocket engineers on the campus of the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in Pasadena. A group of woman called human computers was responsible for the math involved. The women had degrees in math, physics, chemistry and engineering but were having trouble finding a job after graduation until JPL hired them in the 1940 and 50s.Holt provides the reader a look into the lives of these remarkable women as well as the history of rocket science. Remember all the math was done by hand in the days before computers. The book is easy to read and full of fascinating details about discoveries that these women made. I noted that the women continued their education via Caltech courses going on to obtain advance degrees in engineering and computer science. They embraced the early IBM computers and learned to program them learning FORTRAN and other coding languages, they also participated as authors in the published scientific reports. When NASA started dissolving the human computers the women at JPL were just reclassified as engineers and continued working. Of course they did not receive the same pay.In 1958 JPL became part of the new agency called NASA. JPL is managed for NASA by Caltech since 1958 and all JPLers are Caltech employees. I noted Holt stated more women work today as scientist and engineers at JPL than any other NASA Center. Holt also said women have more opportunities in science and engineering at JPL than any other public or private facility, primarily due to the high standard of work by women in this story. Erin Bennett does a good job narrating the book."
12,0316338923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1577136-melody,0,"How could these brilliant mathematicians be subjected to Miss Guided Missile beauty pageants? How could they be qualified to work with an exclusive rocket research group yet be disallowed to interview for engineering positions? How could these women be expected to pack up and leave when they married and had children? I was fascinated with these women, their work and their contributions to science but I needed a strong voice of injustice. Instead I got, ""Barbara might not be the prettiest girl in the lab, but she was sociable and easy to work with."" What? I want a do-over. I would love to see a retelling of the story of the Rocket Girls authored by Hope Jahren."
13,0316338923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8332956-just-a-bean,2,"This book was really frustrating, and I don't think I was the target audience. I feel like the target audience is maybe teenagers who are generally in favour of science, but know very, very little about history or NASA. Hopefully some of them enjoy it.From my perspective, it was trying to cover too much ground in way too short a book, and ended up with a very superficial look at a bunch of stuff I already knew about. The stronger sections of the book were probably about JPL's missile days, which had a lot more detail about what the women were action doing. By the end, it just talked about what projects women worked on, with not much on their contributions, and kept getting sidetracked on unrelated NASA projects.There were also so many different women in play that I had a difficult time keeping track of them, and felt the book would have been better served by picking two or three who had long careers and sticking with them. Or picking a shorter era and focusing in more detail on what the work involved.The prose wasn't great, and the whole thing badly needed an editor."

(computers) I certainly do not put myself in their league; not at all. Goodness, these pioneers worked at the JPL, that's huge. I just mean the early days of computers. (Mine mid-70s) Since I was working for a large corporation at the time, I even got to hear and meet the dynamic, Grace Hooper, twice. In full naval uniform. Anyway, back to the book, when the author is covering facts about the space program, etc. and the projects the women worked on, it was good to read. However, the was way too much info about their appearance, clothes, love life, etc. Why all this, and from a female author. Very disappointed that she felt compelled to add these details, especially in 2016."
15,0316338923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1072582-kaethe-douglas,5,"Loved reading about women making a deliberate effort to hire more women into an unwelcoming field. Plus, there's a lot about math and coding for a non-technical book. But also, it's JPL, and they're exploring the solar system, which is as cool as it gets. I really enjoyed the interweaving of professional and personal events and anecdotes. If you're a fan of end notes, these are especially rich.Library copy."
16,0316338923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3829694-mlpmom-book-reviewer,4,Loved how this read more like a book than an autobiography. Also loved learning about this amazing women that helped pave the way for future generations! They were so inspiring and I loved getting little bits about their every day life and family as well. 
17,0316338923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/320892-emmi,5,"This book tells the story of the women who worked at JPL, the Jet Propulsion Lab, that was part of Caltech and NASA. JPL was founded in the early 1940's. The women were ""computers"", not ""engineers"". They did all the calculations for the early experiments in rocket design, moving on to work on designing missles, and then spacecraft. Initially they did all their work with paper, graph paper, and pencil. Then they used mechanical calculators, and slide rules. As the years passed they became software developers, working on the design of the missions and writing the code for Voyager, Galileo, Cassini, the Mars rovers, and many early pioneering spacecraft, and the Deep Space Network which is a network of tracking stations around the earth that pick up signals from spacecraft.This is an amazing story, a great story for everyone to know, but especially for those who, like me, were girls who dreamed of space. Women doing math and science and computer science, way back in the old days! So exciting!Thank you, Liz, for getting this book for me!"
18,0316338923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17914657-adrienne,2,"The women are fascinating but the book leaves much to be desired. Simplistic prose; choppy, erratic organization; lack of substance and an overall weak writing style all contribute to a lackluster portrayal of a very dynamic time in both American and women's history. The frequent brushing off of opportunities to discuss social issues of the time (e.g. going no further than, ""She was pregnant, so she knew she'd have to quit,"") and glossing over all but the most basic science would have left a mediocre impression regardless; the fact that there are more detailed descriptions of outfits than calculations just left a bad taste. Finishing was a struggle."
19,0316338923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10408789-danielle,5,"Okay, so I'm definitely biased because I had the good fortune to meet the author and the majority of the women featured in the book. This is such an inspiring story, for women everywhere, especially in the sciences. I love JPL, female empowerment and space history so really this was the perfect book for me! I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in history of JPL and wanting to learn about the untold story of female programming pioneers."

Which, given the subject, is incredibly disappointing. This is unlike any biography or history book I've ever read. There are no citations within the text to back up whatever the author is writing at the moment. There are literal fanfic-like scenes of the women picking out their dresses for the day. The writing is awkward and forced. Chapters are bookended by a fanfic interlude in the beginning, to set the mood I suppose, and an awkward transition at the end. Everything's done chronologically, without a very clear line of progress for the women themselves, only JPL. The only names I can recall are Barbara, Helen and Sue, probably because they featured most prominently at the end. Everything's jumbled up together with passing references to this girl and that, barely more than a paragraph all together for some. Interesting and important facts are glossed over, not the least of which being an actual Nazi working at JPL, which earned maybe two sentences and the rest of the book was about his great contributions. Really, none of the women had anything more to say on the subject than basically ""yeah, it was a little awkward""?The book is just a real disappointment. I don't recommend it. It was painful to read and I don't want any of my friends to slog through that."

""but Barbara wouldn’t consider coming to work looking so informal. Every morning she carefully selected dresses and skirts, wore high heels, and always, no matter how hot the day was, put on stockings. Barbara was playful with her clothing, but not at work. She wasn’t interested in attracting anyone at JPL.""Thank you, author, for going in depth on her appearance. I picked up this book specifically to see what Barbara would wear!""Her right index finger was lined with thick red and white calluses, the result of clutching a pencil for hours a day. Her grip on the pencil often made her hand perspire, leaving pucker marks across the graph paper.""This is so helpful in learning about women who helped launch the rocket program during WWII! Probably useful information for Jeopardy! The writing is horrible. I've always believed that scientists and the humanities should always pair up when creating a piece of nonfiction work. We can help! More importantly, the women showcased in the book are important but are presented as objectified pieces. And it's a shame. They deserve better. Now that I know the names of the women who helped launch the rocket program, Google will help me research them to their full intelligent capacity than this book ever could."

We follow a few key women throughout the decades, following the progression of the space program and the role of women in the sciences. The author throws in some fun anecdotes, like when a couple of the women decided it was acceptable to finally wear pant suits, along with the struggles many of these women had in the early days of getting married, getting pregnant, and facing the choice of leaving a job you loved or attempt the fine balancing act of being a working mother. Highly inspiring! Just enough science is covered to give the reader an idea of what's going on in the profession without being overwhelming.

26,0316338923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27591228-lapl-reads,4,"When Natalia Holt, scientific researcher and writer, and her husband were searching for a name for their baby daughter, they googled the name Eleanor Frances. Among the names, she became intrigued with Eleanor Francis Helin, a scientist who had worked at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory for over three decades, starting in the 1960s. Who was this woman and were there other women working at NASA during this time? Two births emerged: baby daughter Eleanor, and a research project about the women behind the rocket science that sent Americans into space.Today there are many innovations which are taken for granted: digitization, hand-held devices that contain chunks of our personal lives and are able to access the world, and more notably news of space stations where astronauts come and go, and the rockets that propel them are part of everyday life. Not that long ago, these were the dreams of science fiction and fantasy writers, but there were many engineers and scientists who had visions of making space travel a reality, and with rare exception almost all of these dreamers were men who worked on the actual projects. There were women, who were not engineers but had strong math skills and were hired as human calculators during the 1940s and 1950s at JPL. These women were not doing simple sums, but complex calculations which produced pages of measurements, and numerous calculation tables vital to, "". . . rocketed heavy bombers over the Pacific, launched America's first satellite, guided lunar missions and planetary exploration."" When rocket science and space travel became a reality, the human calculators were essential to all that took place before, during and after the launches. Holt covers the 1940s through the 1970s, beginning with a portrait of the Suicide Squad, a group of irrepressible scientists who would launch their own rockets from the relatively empty arroyo in Pasadena. There was Caltech and the nascent Jet Propulsion Lab developing the support and innovation for future space exploration. Portraits of the people who worked at JPL reveal their passion for the work which precluded and overshadowed any type of 9 to 5 job schedule. For the most part there was camaraderie, team spirit, and the interpersonal feelings and excitement which permeated all the projects, and created enthusiastic motivation for the staff working on earth-bound jobs to create successful space-projected missionsNot all U.S. engineers and scientists supported rocketry and there were schisms in the ether spheres of institutions such as Caltech and MIT. These two technical institutions had an east-coast-west-coast difference of opinion. There were MIT scientists who scoffed at exploring rocketry and dismissed it as science fiction nonsense, while the Caltech scientists were experimenting with designs and tests in order to fulfill the dream and prove the naysayers wrong.While she dealt with the problems of motherhood and a career, Holt often wondered about those rocket girls and how they managed their lives. She wanted her future daughter, and other young women, not to be hampered by any type of actual or inherent limitations, instead to be inspired by the accomplishments of other women. Holt’s curiosity and determination motivated her to research and write the forgotten history of women whose contributions made space travel possible, and as a reminder to young girls and young women to dream big to achieve big.Reviewed by Sheryn Morris, Librarian, Central Library"
27,0316338923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36939368-d-r-oestreicher,5,"Rise of the Rocket Girls by Nathalia Holt intertwines two historical narratives: NASA space exploration and the women at Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). Both these stories started with World War II, but with the end of that war, the efforts transitioned to scientific missions.In the beginning women could not be engineers, but they could be computers – women who manually performed the complex calculations required by male engineers. As bad as this discrimination might sound today, it was a great opportunity for women in the 40s and 50s when many engineering schools didn't even accept women anyway. These were rigorous technical jobs, sometimes given to women who showed only promise and interest, sometimes right out of high school. Their success was what we might expect today, but would have shocked the people of their generation who didn't expect women to work, and if they did, the career choices were nurse, teacher, and secretary, not planning interplanetary missions.Aside from all working on space exploration, the women were from different races, and some married, some divorced, some had children, some didn't. As today, this history shows that gender tells little about a person. This is a wonderful history of technical women and NASA.For more see: http://1book42day.blogspot.com/2016/0..."

It was hard to tell whether the women just solved problems asked by the engineers or whether they were an integral part of the design process.The book mentions the challenges with work/life balance and, superficially, several of the women's home relationships. But, at a time when most women didn't have ""careers"", I would like to know more of how their families and peers regarded them and even how rival groups regarded JPL in this respect. Perhaps the problem of the book was in trying to cover too much time (the 1930s to present) with too many women (I honestly got them confused). Great topic, but left me wanting more on many levels."
30,0316338923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6118363-ritu-vincent,2,"Interesting subject matter but weak execution. I wish the book had gone into more depth - the writing style almost felt like it was aimed at very young readers and all the women were presented as basically the same person (pretty, liked numbers, joined JPL, married, had kids, left JPL, missed JPL, maybe came back) with no individual personality traits. Also, some women's stories were abruptly dropped at various points in the book, which was odd."

I think any history buff would enjoy this one."

This time, unlike Hidden Figures, the action takes place on the West Coast. It could’ve been called the women of JPL. I feel like, as I continue to read more books about humanity’s odyssey beyond the earth, each one I read fills in more details. They are always compelling.This story focuses, of course on the female contribution to the space program, but it also tells much of the story of the work at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. This is not so much about sending astronauts into space but on the probes sent out to explore the planets, including the Voyagers and the Galileo and Cassini probes as well as the various missions to Mars and Venus. It’s a magnificent story.I love the fact that it also focuses to on the lives of the various women chronicled here. Personal lives are often left out of other histories, but they are huge part of the story. Just because you’re watching a greater history unfold doesn’t minimize what’s happening in your everyday life. This is a much more complete picture.I felt as though I got to know these women and like them as people. An intimate history. I highly recommend it."
33,0316338923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13239516-kara-of-bookishbytes,5,"The Rise of the Rocket Girls tells the story of a group of women who worked at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (or JPL) as human computers beginning in the 1940s. At that time, of course, computers--even calculators--were yet to be invented, so people had to do all mathematical calculations with pencil and paper. As rocket technology was being invented at JPL, all of the human calculators were women. They were smart, they were involved in the design and launch of spacecraft and their work was completely trusted by the male engineering staff. (Unfortunately, for decades, none of the women at JPL were given the title ""engineer"" even if their work was comparable to what the male engineers were doing. While most of the women highlighted in this book were never given a work title other than ""computer"", JPL did eventually recognize their indispensability and give them all of the human computers the title ""engineer"" regardless of their educational qualifications.)These women were also at the forefront of computer programming. As IBM developed electronic computers, the Rocket Girls trained in how to use them and there was a period of time (that appeared to last for many years) during which it seemed that the only computer programmers at JPL were women. I was surprised at the attitude that the author recounted of some of the male engineers who said they didn't trust the electronic computer's calculations--they wouldn't be confident until the women confirmed the results with pencil and paper. I almost can't imagine thinking a person could do math better than a computer. But that's how good these women were. (And also how uncertain people were of computer technology in its infancy.)Interwoven with the stories of rocket tests and trajectories are the personal stories of several of these remarkable women. They came from a range of backgrounds and it was wonderful to read about how different they all were--but how they all shared the drive to be excellent in their cutting edge work. Lots of girl power here, and no back-biting or malicious melodrama. I read a library copy of this book, but I've bought my own copy to have because I want my kids to all read this and I want to be able to pass it around to friends."
34,0316338923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3809399-stormin,4,"It's really hard not to compare this book directly with the (more famous) Hidden Figures: The American Dream and the Untold Story of the Black Women Mathematicians Who Helped Win the Space Race, and the conclusion is simple: Rise of the Rocket Girls is a better book.There are two main reasons for this. First, the book has a more concentrated narrative. Hidden Figures is all over the place, with long, long tangents that don't really go anywhere and no central narrative. It's more of an exhaustive index of things that happened in the lives of female, black computers than a story of any kind. By contrast, Rise of the Rocket Girls has much more accessible themes--like the desire of the female (white and black) computers to be a part of inventing rockets to explore space instead of just to deliver warheads and kill people.Second, the book had really great scientific explanations. I'm not a physicist or aerospace engineer or anything like that, but I do have a quantitative background with degrees in math, systems engineering, and economics. So I do know a thing or two about math, and so I can recognize a really good mathematical explanation when I see one. You know, the kind of explanation where the meaning is clear to anyone (regardless of their mathematical background) but the meaning is also faithful to the actual, technical concept being explained. That's really hard to do, and Nathalia Hold makes it look effortless. This make the book more fun to read, because you felt like you were getting a real feel for the kinds of scientific problems that these women were solving.I can easily imagine that the material in Hidden Figures made for a better movie (I haven't seen it yet), but as far as books go, this is the one I'd read if I had to pick just one."
35,0316338923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/55339687-linds,2,"Yuck.To me, it is nearly invaluable that someone took the initiative to track down the surviving JPL 'human computers' and get their stories. That's something that isn't on record anywhere, and that history, particularly various anecdotes they may have from that time period, is very intriguing.But, yeesh. The way it was put together and the items the author chose to highlight drove me insane. I gave it two stars only because there are, in fact, good bits of information to be found. I do have to applaud the author for getting these women together again. But most of it felt like such a waste of a golden opportunity.The author spends the majority of the book talking about whichever ""rocket girl"" is being focused on and her hair, her clothes, her boyfriend/husband, her children, her troubles at home, etc. I'm sure that plays a part, but I really would have liked that to take more of a backseat. The interesting info about JPL felt more like asterisks at the bottom of the page.I majored in engineering, and I've worked for NASA. I've been the only female in many situations. I support giving these ladies a spotlight. I just think this book is so busy hamming up their gender that it forgets to fully illuminate their accomplishments. The idea isn't to say, ""Look, we're girls!"" The idea is to say, ""Yeah. We're awesome.""(Another book released recently, The Glass Universe: How the Ladies of the Harvard Observatory Took the Measure of the Stars does a much better job of this, for anyone interested. Though I warn it hits the other extreme for any not really keen on the subject. It is quite information and background heavy.)"

However, I just could not finish this book. It read as if it were an outline of chronological events with a few verbs and adjectives thrown in there. There was not one character that I felt tied to enough to want to finish the book. The author jumped from person to person, not developing one single character. So many names were dropped that I could not keep track of who was who. This barrage of women was punctuated by an attempt to connect the reader to them by telling brief, campy quips of detailed information about dresses, beauty pageants, and personal relationships. By trying to cover so much, the author truly did these amazing women a disservice with her poor writing. Had she taken the time to tell one or two stories really well, the book would really be able to celebrate the work of all of these amazing women."
37,0316338923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32637832-anne,3,"The author had obviously done a lot of research, and I really liked that she was able to explain a lot of the STEM stuff so that even an anti-STEM person like me could understand it. But throughout the book, I felt that she was writing at a young adult level instead of an adult non-fiction level. I even checked the spine label to see if our library had designated the book in that way. I know a lot of adults like to read young adult books, but I am not one of them, so I found the tone simplistic and somewhat demeaning. I mean, seriously, I used to OPERATE a key punch machine. I know what one is. "
38,0316338923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7029980-katie-doing-dewey,4,"Review: This was a fun read and highlighted some important work, but I would have liked more depth on the technical side of the story.Long before 'computers' were calculating machines, they were mathematicians (primarily women) and eventually the first software developers. Working at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, an elite group of female computers fought hard to balance personal lives with careers they loved at a time when that was still considered a highly unusual thing for a woman to do. Through their expertise and painstaking effort, these computers ""transformed rocket design, helped bring about the first American satellites, and made the exploration of the solar system possible"" (source).I was initially a bit disappointed by this book. The first story, focused on Barby Canright, spent a lot of time talking about her clothes, her makeup, and her relationships. That wouldn't bother me, except there were also very few technical details of her work and a lot of the story focused on one of the men she worked with. Fortunately, it got better from there. All of the other women's stories also talked about their relationships, but this was balanced by information about the work they did. I suspect that the bad beginning at least partially reflected the fact that earlier women computers were primarily doing math to implement other people's ideas. They weren't allowed to serve as engineers and were probably not often able to suggest experiments.Occasionally, I did still feel that the author was stereotyping the women, (for instance, an older women was put in charge of the group not because of her experience, but because she was 'a  mother hen') but overall the stories got better towards the end. I did really like that the author just told the women's stories, without digressing into discussions of stereotypes and the barriers they faced. She let their stories speak for themselves. And they were great stories! Like in 
Hidden Figures
, the author followed many women over decades, so we could see how many different women chose to balance their careers and how things changed over time. Many of the women worked on incredibly important space exploration efforts. The missions that gave us our first images of other planets were particularly awe-inspiring. Overall, I had a lot of fun reading this book. I just would have liked some more technical details to round it out!This review was originally posted on Doing Dewey"
39,0316338923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1256262-ron,4,"“Engineers make up the problems and we solve them.” Helen LingDespite the cringe-worthy title, an excellent history of the women who contributed to the unique successes of Caltech’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). Superb concept and research. Too bad the storytelling falls short. With so large a cast, Holt often fails to identify her frequent shifts of focus character. Even as an advocacy work, her biases bleed through too obviously. “As odd as it seems by today’s standards, the beauty contest was a result of JPL’s progressive hiring practices … unintentionally highlight the presence of educated young women working for JPL.”Even with its shortcomings this sets the record straight about the vital contributions of the “computers” as they were called before the advent of massive and micro-computers of the last fifty years. “She didn’t feel intimidated. Instead she felt invisible.” “Many saw the shuttle as competition.” It certainly contested budget dollars, if not official and public attention. JPL continued to plan and execute successful scientific missions while most of NASA’s attention and money was wasted on grandstanding with people. (In my opinion, JPL’s Deep Space Network continues to do more science that the International Space Station.)“There was no doubt in her mind or anyone else’s that if they’d gone ahead with their design and put a satellite at the helm and fuel in that final stage, their creation would be circling the earth at this very moment.” (September 2, 1956)See also Hidden Figures, the story behind the contemporary black women climbing an even steeper hill at NASA Langley Research Center (Hampton, Virginia). Don’t understand why neither were nominated for Hugo Awards as related works.“Proper paranoia.” Gentry Lee JPL’s frequent failures highlight the risk when pushing the envelope of the possible. Those now planning to send people to Mars should reflect on the low success rate of unmanned missions to the red planet. “We’re a sisterhood.”"

It takes the reader all the way back to when Malina, Parsons, and a young group of men were doing their own experiments in the foothills, all the way to the 1980's. Now, if you're looking to learn more about women's contribution to this industry, I suggest you read Hidden Figures For a book that is supposed to be about what women accomplished at JPL, it really sings the praises of the men. All I got from this book was that women were computers. It didn't go into any details though. But boy, did it tell us exactly what the men did. Plus for a book about science, I don't understand why women's fashion was a point that needed to be brought up. Yes, there was a female revolution going on, but what exactly does wearing pants have to do with sending a rocket into space? The book says their colleagues didn't care. So why bring up this inane topic in the first place?And don't get me started on the lady that felt sympathetic for a Nazi war criminal. I get that he contributed a lot to science. But.... let's not forget the 6 million people that died!! Their lives are more important to me than shooting metal hunks of debris into space. In conclusion, read Hidden Figures instead!!!!! It's superbly well-written and details the contributions of a handful of women in the space industry."
41,0316338923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64510958-tayler-card,3,"The book The Rise of the Rocket Girls by Nathalia Holt was the stories of revolutionary women who helped pave the way in modern rocketry. The biography is a collection of stories of women who overcame adversities to pursue jobs, men typically had and women could normally not hold. These courageous women were know as computers. They were the mathematicians of the Jet Proportion Laboratory known as JPL. They came from around the United States and even other countries. They held positions of prestige, which had long hours, poor conditions, and many risks, where lives were on the line if you made a mistake. Despite the conditions, the laboratory was a tight group and had multiple outside events together. For the women, they found a second home, a place where they could thrive and not have to hide their brilliance.I personally enjoyed learning about the women's lives and there experiences, inside and out of JPL. The insight of the outside world and knowledge about history I found fascinating.I had a distaste for how much the book mentioned the mechanics instead of the people in the book. I also had an aversion for how quickly characters were introduced, abscond and mentioned much later in the book without any previous reference. I found the book quite intriguing, but a little bland. I did however enjoy the stories, especially the ironic ones. I found the writing style suitable for the content of the book, but it made it slightly difficult to follow. It doesn't really move the reader to activism, it makes you frustrated, but you feel that it's in the past. I think people who enjoy factual writing this book is for them."
42,0316338923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12860715-librarycin,3,"This book follows some of the human calculators who worked for NASA (and the precursor to NASA), starting in the 1940s up to and including the 21st century. It follows both their work and their home lives. Of course, at their work early on, it was mostly women who were the calculators, while men were the engineers. As women of the time, they were expected to leave when/if they got married, then pregnant.I listened to the audio and my interest came and went. What I paid attention to was interesting. As we got closer to current times, with my (for a while) interest in astronomy, it was fun to read about some of those space missions that I remember. Well, the first one I really remember wasn’t a “fun” one, Challenger in 1986, but some of the later ones were: Hubble Space Telescope, Spirit and Opportunity (sent to Mars to take photos and explore; intended on only lasting 1 year on the planet, but lasted 5 and 10 years instead!), and more. Oh, I also enjoyed the one little tidbit of info about Jupiter’s moon Io (which I named my current oldest cat after) – apparently it is filled with volcanoes. "
43,0316338923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4922340-kathy,3,"This book was a mixed bag for me. I was very interested in learning about these pioneering women and the men who supported them in their careers, and it didn’t disappoint on that front. I also learned A LOT about the space missions that I didn’t know. That being said, I got bogged down in the science at times and I was a scientist (albeit a geneticist, not a physicist or mathematician). I also found the story to jump around too much. I guess it was hard to tell all of these women’s stories without rehashing everything a million times but I kept getting lost. Maybe it is my corona brain. At the end of the day, I’m glad I read it but I was also counting down the pages for half the book, which isn’t exactly a glowing endorsement. "

47,0316338923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67951314-phrodrick,3,"Mine is a review of the large print edition, hard back of Nathalia Holt's Rise of the Rocket Girls. This is important because I found the large print edition particularly well bound, easy to read and easy to handle. It is rare that I notice anything about the binding of a book, but this edition does honor to the printer's art. The text however was less than it should have been. This is the history of the women who were the original computers at The Jet Propulsion Laboratory. As a former computer instructor, it always amazed me that most of my students had no clue that the word computer derives from the process of doing math, that people were employed as computers before there were machines to do the math, and that the machine is so named because what it does is math. What I did not know, until reading here is that hand done math had been the preferred method well into the space age. Ms. Holt makes it clear that by-hand calculations were just losing out to the machine about the time America was sending Apollo missions to the moon.What is now JPL began in the 1940’s as three collage age kids operating at great physical risk and minimal permission at Cal Tech. Being young and unsupervised they called themselves, The Suicide Squad. Their lack of safety procedures ultimately forced the school to push them out doors and away from campus. There they reformed as a business the JPL, The Jet Propulsion Laboratory.Their first income derived from their work for the US Army Air Corps developing the rocket engines used in JATO, Jet Assisted Take Off. These were basic jet engines strapped to propeller aircraft for the purpose of helping them launch quickly from short runways. The technique developed in WW II was still in use into the 1960's. Among the things that made JPL different was its willingness to employ women. In fact, the Computer department at JPL became a place where women, later including African American women could find professional level employment as advanced mathematicians. It is rarely appreciated that even in the 1940's and1950's women were able, if they were better than enough men to get advanced university training in mathematics. Most often the only work for them was as primary school teachers. However, there were places in various parts of the emerging world of what we now call High tech for women. It is now emerging that women had leading, if underappreciated roles in the development of Computers (the machines), and computer codes. Thanks to Ms Holt we know by name some of the women in the hard work of doing the math for the development of rocket engines.Returning to this book. I found Ms Holt writing to be vaguely under written. As if she was writing to a younger audience. Clearly, she was avoiding any detailed discussion of the math. Rather like describing how to make a complex menu item and avoiding all mention of the ingredients. Yes, math can be dull, but a better author can help you to share the frustrations and pleasure to be derived by the ability to handle complex math, under pressure and routinely produce reliable results. This is after all, rocket science. To most people this sounds dull. If your goal is to honor these women- and Ms. Holt wants us to honor them- and to inspire girls to follow, a few pages that detail the tedium and make clear the absolute demand for people up to this specialized set of challenges should have been better documented.What is best about the Rise of the Rocket Girls is that Ms. Holt sought out and interviewed the women who were the calculators. We see JPL progress from small military applications to the Apollo Launch pad. These women adapted to and took leadership roles in adapting the original desk calculators, capable of only a few mathematical processes replaced the slide rule. Later we get a worker’s point of view when the first generations of huge computers made hesitant, and cranky appearances before becoming the miracle machines we now barely think of - laptops, and smart phones and etc. These two generation of women learned how to program and master these machines. They are among the first rank of computer engineers. As exciting and inspirational as are the facts, Ms. Holt under serves them. She is given to name dropping. German, in fact ex Nazi Scientist Wernher von Braun, barely deserves his several mentions. Why she has to mention Carl Sagan is an open question. That there is a great deal about clothes, changing styles and the success or failure of their romantic lives may be part of telling “Her-Story” rather than “His-story”. A case can be made for mentions made the pants suits in the work place. But do we need the unrelated history of the invention of panty hose?The Rise of the Rocket Girls is an easy read. History for the casual, even the beach reader. But their work was anything but easy. Maybe asking more of the reader would have made this a better book. "
48,0316338923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4869474-jeane,4,"I really enjoyed this book for many reasons. First off, it was a great micro-history that focused on this historical women and the contributions to science and math and the entire space program, without them there would not have been one. Another reason I enjoyed this book is because my husband works at JPL and so many of the things they discuss in the book I am familiar with from his stories he comes home with. "
49,0316338923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3086584-shanon,5,I love this style of writing.

50,0316338923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14909704-ari-santillanes,4,"One of the main reasons I read is something called ""book fate."" I suppose I should expand the term to something like ""reading fate,"" but here's the general idea: I believe that I have been fated - predestined - to encounter certain reading material at exactly the right time in my life. I do not believe in coincidences.My latest encounter with book fate involves Nathalia Holt's book, Rise of the Rocket Girls: The Women Who Propelled Us, From Missles to the Moon to Mars. The writing style left something to be desired, but the content enthralled me. It is the story of the women who dedicated their lives - certainly their life's work - to the Jet Propulsion Lab (JPL) as computers and engineers from the 1940s to present. I don't read many histories, so how did this one find its way into my hands?My dad gave it to me. He confessed it was a title he hoped to read, but because it was at the end of a long queue, he thought maybe I could read it first. Right there, postponing his own date with the book enabled me to have it at the right moment! On the subject of dads, I started reading the book near Father's Day, and one of the unifying characteristics of many of the women is the early loss of their fathers. They recounted childhoods where their mothers, in a time when it certainly wasn't the norm, supported several children through pure determination and strong work ethic. Though not directly stated, I can infer that this produced a drive in the women of JPL to support themselves. Through realistic depictions of struggle (depression, divorce, raising children and families), Holt shows how many of the women are determined to maintain their independence through work. I feel deeply connected to the women in this respect. I've never considered being a stay-at-home mom, though I tremendously respect the work such mothers do. When I have children of my own, I anticipate that Mat and I will work hard to make our professional commitments manageable alongside our family priorities. That scares me, because professional and filial fulfillment are things that I value, things that often compete. I appreciated reading the stories of women who pioneered the concept of a ""working mom"" and remained intimidated by its implications. It was my goal to get this book returned/loaned to my dad before I left for Anaheim. It's a hardback and I didn't want to carry it with me on a plane. But failing to finish it and with so little to go, it was impossible to leave it behind. This is how fate works; it is not always convenient. Once I made it to Anaheim, all I could think about was its proximity to Pasadena. I stared to wonder: Does JPL offer tours? Would the women engineers working there be flattered or resentful if I geeked out and asked them, fangirlishly, to sign my book so that when I return it to my dad, it has some sacred weight to it? Am I really, in a town where celebrity sightings can happen anytime, fantasizing about meeting more down-to-earth people who just so happen to champion exploration among the stars?The final fated alignment was that Sue Finley's last project was about to culminate on July 4th, when Juno arrives at Jupiter. Though I learned this in the book's Epilogue, I first heard it from Mat when we were flying to Anaheim. As we were waiting to board the plane, literally minutes away, he stepped out of our boarding group to check one more newsstand for a ""good magazine."" He returned with a Scientific American which, in addition to containing many other compelling stories (we may have to subscribe) contained one detailing Juno's mission. Of all the magazines in all the world, he had to choose the one that added to my book! As I read over his shoulder, 30-40,000 feet in the air, I marveled at the constellation of connections between my reading material and my life. "

It isn't the story of getting a 'man' into space, like Hidden Figures and there is not 'civil rights' side to the story. This is the story of the smart women who worked in Pasadena at the Jet Propulsion Lab to build the rockets that would carry man to the moon and telescopes out to far away planets. It is also the story of the rise of the working woman who wanted a career and a family. These very bright women were gifted mathematicians and engineers in a time when girls weren't suppose to be good with numbers and most certainly not engineering. The author, Holt, focuses on a cluster of ladies who went to work at JPL just was WWII was winding down and stayed with the program until the turn of the century. The reader not only gets to know these precious ladies but gets a review of history from the rise of McCarthyism, to JFK's vision for our space program, to what we owe to it today. Women of a certain age will remember 'not being pregnant' at work and the debate over if 'we' could wear a pantsuit to work. For those who aren't up to keeping track of all the details about rocket propulsion, parts may be skimmed, but focus of these ladies and their wonderful friendships. The author does let you know what happened to each when their careers ended."

There is technical information that might be too much for the average reader and then, there were those who felt the author dealt too much with silly or sexist things about pageants and children or whatever made up these women's lives; (but isn’t that’s just it?), all the silly or sexist things made up the lives of our Rocket Girls. These women worked both outside the home in very demanding jobs and inside the home with husbands, children, family and society which is an all together different type of demanding yet extremely important job, and, at a time when women were considered an oddity if they worked apart from the home. I found this book captivating. There were moments when I wondered “why did the author put that there?” but then I realized those personal tidbits set apart from the highly technical and specialized positions spoken of were no less a part of these women and the times they were living in. This story tells about what the women went through to get to where we are today in engineering, space exploration, military weaponry and even our very own computer systems. These women adapted and struggled in order to make it in a man’s world but in my view and probably more important is the fact that each of these women enjoyed being women, and through it all were willing to sacrifice and strive for not only personal recognition and gain but also for the gain of future generations of women choosing to excel in mathematics and the sciences. This sisterhood remains strong in mutual respect and admiration because of their close knit working conditions and the friendships formed over time. Through the long hours endured and their strong, exacting work ethics they helped to achieve greatness and prosperity for our country first and foremost but also for a myriad of others who have taken what they started to the next levels.The author has written a fabulously warm-hearted and scientifically beautiful story of intelligent, witty and memorable first female engineers that deserves a top rank in your reading list. If you just couldn’t make it through the paper version I urge you to listen to the audiobook. Narrator Erin Bennett has provided a genuinely flawless production (well, there might have been a technical word or two she found difficult, but there’s not many who can say external disturbance-gravity gradient effect, magnetic-field torques, solar radiation and aerodynamic drag or radioisotope thermoelectric generator three times fast). Her voice was strong, easy to listen to and without excessive drama. Nathalia Holt brought the women to life but Erin Bennett took them off the page and let them live the past once again right before us.I hope you find this story as amazing and inspirational as I did.5 stars overall"

Hidden Figures: The American Dream and the Untold Story of the Black Women Mathematicians Who Helped Win the Space Race
, a book I desperately wanted to like because it is both so important and timely as well as the basis for an upcoming film which happens to look great ... but that other book, sadly, stumbled in several stylistic or organizational ways, which is not a problem here in Nathalia Holt's record of some different women who happened to be doing the same thing at the same time as their NASA counterparts as documented in Hidden Figures. But comparisons are doomed to fail; these books are attempting different things, and while Rise of the Rocket Girls doesn't pack the same punch in commentary on racism, it covers altogether different territory in its examination of the complex and ever-evolving relationship between motherhood (specifically) and work for these women computers. And it does so with clear organization, accessibility of language and thought, and a deft touch with the research. Complicated principles of orbital dynamics and so forth are woven in, yes, but always at the service of the narrative through-line, which tracks a slowly-changing group of women through the decades. Each section is organized around a handful of the larger group, and these women are highlighted gracefully and with care. The personal narrative voice breaks through occasionally, but not distractingly so. In short, stylistically, this is the book to read if you're looking for a primer on women computers in the space age; the content of other books like Hidden Figures may prove enlightening (and the jury's still out on the Junior edition of that book, which hasn't returned to my library yet) but they lack the energy and clarity of this book."
56,0316338923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34366105-lynette-caulkins,5,"Wow! Fantastic non-fiction read! In telling us the story about the women of the Jet Propulsion Lab, Holt brings us a the bonus of another angle of the rise and development of the space exploration era. This one peers at the history from outside Cape Canaveral/Kennedy, and thus provides a fuller understanding of how widespread the industry has been - there is so much more than ""just"" NASA. This book will appeal to a broad spectrum - men and women, older and youthful. While containing trivial memoir-style annecdotes that infuse the more technical discussions with personal interest and keep the book from getting heavy, it's not a Chick Lit piece that would bore someone like my husband (in fact, he's reading it now). (And don't take my words to indicate that he's a chauvinist, because he's no such thing, and he loves strong female characters - just, living in a house of all women and girls, he sometimes feels that certain books or movies have ""too much estrogen for me right now"". This book definitely will not do that for him.) The writing is very engaging, so no yawning over Holt's work. Rise leaves me wanting to find recent books about the planets and their moons, and wanting to find out more from my father about his time working on the Space Shuttle programming. The only way this book could be better is if the title used ""Women"" instead of the diminuizing ""Girls,"" as these were all very much adults, and highly accomplished and respected ones at that.Oh yeah, and now I'm going to play the recordings from Voyager's gold record while I make some minestrone soup. . . Thank you, Nathalia Holt, for one of those reads that pull your mind into its zone long after you've turned the last page. :) "
57,0316338923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5005999-victor-harris,2," Very uneven and got lost in the narrative it was trying to tell. It jumps between detailed discussions of - if you will - rocket science, to low-level prose almost geared to a high school audience. It had the annoying habit of repeating how tired the women were while holding a demanding full-time job and trying to raise children. Mentioning it once or twice would have clinched the point.  The nomenclature of the time is interesting. These brilliant women who were at the cutting edge of rocket, military, and space technology going back to the late 30s and early 40s, were actually designated as "" computers."" This was obviously before that word had taken on strictly a mechanical, technological connotation.  The most striking parts of this account were the descriptions of the multiple failures as America was finding it footing in the increasingly intense competition with the Soviet Union in the Space Race. It is remarkable how many of the misfires were a product of pure carelessness; often with tragic effects. A topic with a great deal of potential but the themes did not get adequately developed and frequently got mangled in the delivery. A low 2 rating."

Not only did I learn a lot about rocket and planetary science, but I felt like the women in this book, though we are separated by two generations, got me. They were trailblazers as women in science and math. They broke social norms of being working mothers when only 20% of women with small children worked. They paved the way for my generation to have what we have today. Yes, they were paid less and weren't allowed (at first) to be engineers; but, they made it possible for the rest of us. Special shout-out to the women who discriminated against men and only hired women to act as ""computers"" at the Jet Propulsion Lab (JPL). I had serious PTSD flashbacks to Mrs. Semro's geometry and algebra II when the author talked about using carbon paper while making computations. Also, thank you, Suicide Squad, turned JPL, for hiring a bunch of women.Bottom-line, every young woman should read this book. Had I read this book when I was younger, I may not have fallen victim to the stereotype of women in STEM. Read, read, read."

It had been 3 weeks since I had left the book at a friend's house, so I had to slog through the entire book out of some sense of committment. I am going to have to re-think committment to books. I wanted to give this book 2☆. Maybe I am being generous. Maybe I am grateful for a little more technical I formation about rockets and outer space and beginning-estimate (that's a word :-s) history of automated computers and rockets and space travel. Maybe because it is unfair to rate this book with Hidden Figures: The American Dream and the Untold Story of the Black Women Mathematicians Who Helped Win the Space Race felt sluggish to me.

I wish the book had gone into more depth - the writing style almost felt like it was aimed at very young readers and all the women were presented as basically the same person (pretty, liked numbers, joined JPL, married, had kids, left JPL, missed JPL, maybe came back) with no individual personality traits. Also, some women's stories were abruptly dropped at various points in the book, which was odd."

I think any history buff would enjoy this one."

This time, unlike Hidden Figures, the action takes place on the West Coast. It could’ve been called the women of JPL. I feel like, as I continue to read more books about humanity’s odyssey beyond the earth, each one I read fills in more details. They are always compelling.This story focuses, of course on the female contribution to the space program, but it also tells much of the story of the work at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. This is not so much about sending astronauts into space but on the probes sent out to explore the planets, including the Voyagers and the Galileo and Cassini probes as well as the various missions to Mars and Venus. It’s a magnificent story.I love the fact that it also focuses to on the lives of the various women chronicled here. Personal lives are often left out of other histories, but they are huge part of the story. Just because you’re watching a greater history unfold doesn’t minimize what’s happening in your everyday life. This is a much more complete picture.I felt as though I got to know these women and like them as people. An intimate history. I highly recommend it."
63,0316338923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13239516-kara-of-bookishbytes,5,"The Rise of the Rocket Girls tells the story of a group of women who worked at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (or JPL) as human computers beginning in the 1940s. At that time, of course, computers--even calculators--were yet to be invented, so people had to do all mathematical calculations with pencil and paper. As rocket technology was being invented at JPL, all of the human calculators were women. They were smart, they were involved in the design and launch of spacecraft and their work was completely trusted by the male engineering staff. (Unfortunately, for decades, none of the women at JPL were given the title ""engineer"" even if their work was comparable to what the male engineers were doing. While most of the women highlighted in this book were never given a work title other than ""computer"", JPL did eventually recognize their indispensability and give them all of the human computers the title ""engineer"" regardless of their educational qualifications.)These women were also at the forefront of computer programming. As IBM developed electronic computers, the Rocket Girls trained in how to use them and there was a period of time (that appeared to last for many years) during which it seemed that the only computer programmers at JPL were women. I was surprised at the attitude that the author recounted of some of the male engineers who said they didn't trust the electronic computer's calculations--they wouldn't be confident until the women confirmed the results with pencil and paper. I almost can't imagine thinking a person could do math better than a computer. But that's how good these women were. (And also how uncertain people were of computer technology in its infancy.)Interwoven with the stories of rocket tests and trajectories are the personal stories of several of these remarkable women. They came from a range of backgrounds and it was wonderful to read about how different they all were--but how they all shared the drive to be excellent in their cutting edge work. Lots of girl power here, and no back-biting or malicious melodrama. I read a library copy of this book, but I've bought my own copy to have because I want my kids to all read this and I want to be able to pass it around to friends."
64,0316338923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3809399-stormin,4,"It's really hard not to compare this book directly with the (more famous) Hidden Figures: The American Dream and the Untold Story of the Black Women Mathematicians Who Helped Win the Space Race, and the conclusion is simple: Rise of the Rocket Girls is a better book.There are two main reasons for this. First, the book has a more concentrated narrative. Hidden Figures is all over the place, with long, long tangents that don't really go anywhere and no central narrative. It's more of an exhaustive index of things that happened in the lives of female, black computers than a story of any kind. By contrast, Rise of the Rocket Girls has much more accessible themes--like the desire of the female (white and black) computers to be a part of inventing rockets to explore space instead of just to deliver warheads and kill people.Second, the book had really great scientific explanations. I'm not a physicist or aerospace engineer or anything like that, but I do have a quantitative background with degrees in math, systems engineering, and economics. So I do know a thing or two about math, and so I can recognize a really good mathematical explanation when I see one. You know, the kind of explanation where the meaning is clear to anyone (regardless of their mathematical background) but the meaning is also faithful to the actual, technical concept being explained. That's really hard to do, and Nathalia Hold makes it look effortless. This make the book more fun to read, because you felt like you were getting a real feel for the kinds of scientific problems that these women were solving.I can easily imagine that the material in Hidden Figures made for a better movie (I haven't seen it yet), but as far as books go, this is the one I'd read if I had to pick just one."
65,0316338923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/55339687-linds,2,"Yuck.To me, it is nearly invaluable that someone took the initiative to track down the surviving JPL 'human computers' and get their stories. That's something that isn't on record anywhere, and that history, particularly various anecdotes they may have from that time period, is very intriguing.But, yeesh. The way it was put together and the items the author chose to highlight drove me insane. I gave it two stars only because there are, in fact, good bits of information to be found. I do have to applaud the author for getting these women together again. But most of it felt like such a waste of a golden opportunity.The author spends the majority of the book talking about whichever ""rocket girl"" is being focused on and her hair, her clothes, her boyfriend/husband, her children, her troubles at home, etc. I'm sure that plays a part, but I really would have liked that to take more of a backseat. The interesting info about JPL felt more like asterisks at the bottom of the page.I majored in engineering, and I've worked for NASA. I've been the only female in many situations. I support giving these ladies a spotlight. I just think this book is so busy hamming up their gender that it forgets to fully illuminate their accomplishments. The idea isn't to say, ""Look, we're girls!"" The idea is to say, ""Yeah. We're awesome.""(Another book released recently, The Glass Universe: How the Ladies of the Harvard Observatory Took the Measure of the Stars does a much better job of this, for anyone interested. Though I warn it hits the other extreme for any not really keen on the subject. It is quite information and background heavy.)"

However, I just could not finish this book. It read as if it were an outline of chronological events with a few verbs and adjectives thrown in there. There was not one character that I felt tied to enough to want to finish the book. The author jumped from person to person, not developing one single character. So many names were dropped that I could not keep track of who was who. This barrage of women was punctuated by an attempt to connect the reader to them by telling brief, campy quips of detailed information about dresses, beauty pageants, and personal relationships. By trying to cover so much, the author truly did these amazing women a disservice with her poor writing. Had she taken the time to tell one or two stories really well, the book would really be able to celebrate the work of all of these amazing women."
67,0316338923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32637832-anne,3,"The author had obviously done a lot of research, and I really liked that she was able to explain a lot of the STEM stuff so that even an anti-STEM person like me could understand it. But throughout the book, I felt that she was writing at a young adult level instead of an adult non-fiction level. I even checked the spine label to see if our library had designated the book in that way. I know a lot of adults like to read young adult books, but I am not one of them, so I found the tone simplistic and somewhat demeaning. I mean, seriously, I used to OPERATE a key punch machine. I know what one is. "
68,0316338923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7029980-katie-doing-dewey,4,"Review: This was a fun read and highlighted some important work, but I would have liked more depth on the technical side of the story.Long before 'computers' were calculating machines, they were mathematicians (primarily women) and eventually the first software developers. Working at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, an elite group of female computers fought hard to balance personal lives with careers they loved at a time when that was still considered a highly unusual thing for a woman to do. Through their expertise and painstaking effort, these computers ""transformed rocket design, helped bring about the first American satellites, and made the exploration of the solar system possible"" (source).I was initially a bit disappointed by this book. The first story, focused on Barby Canright, spent a lot of time talking about her clothes, her makeup, and her relationships. That wouldn't bother me, except there were also very few technical details of her work and a lot of the story focused on one of the men she worked with. Fortunately, it got better from there. All of the other women's stories also talked about their relationships, but this was balanced by information about the work they did. I suspect that the bad beginning at least partially reflected the fact that earlier women computers were primarily doing math to implement other people's ideas. They weren't allowed to serve as engineers and were probably not often able to suggest experiments.Occasionally, I did still feel that the author was stereotyping the women, (for instance, an older women was put in charge of the group not because of her experience, but because she was 'a  mother hen') but overall the stories got better towards the end. I did really like that the author just told the women's stories, without digressing into discussions of stereotypes and the barriers they faced. She let their stories speak for themselves. And they were great stories! Like in 
Hidden Figures
, the author followed many women over decades, so we could see how many different women chose to balance their careers and how things changed over time. Many of the women worked on incredibly important space exploration efforts. The missions that gave us our first images of other planets were particularly awe-inspiring. Overall, I had a lot of fun reading this book. I just would have liked some more technical details to round it out!This review was originally posted on Doing Dewey"

Superb concept and research. Too bad the storytelling falls short. With so large a cast, Holt often fails to identify her frequent shifts of focus character. Even as an advocacy work, her biases bleed through too obviously. “As odd as it seems by today’s standards, the beauty contest was a result of JPL’s progressive hiring practices … unintentionally highlight the presence of educated young women working for JPL.”Even with its shortcomings this sets the record straight about the vital contributions of the “computers” as they were called before the advent of massive and micro-computers of the last fifty years. “She didn’t feel intimidated. Instead she felt invisible.” “Many saw the shuttle as competition.” It certainly contested budget dollars, if not official and public attention. JPL continued to plan and execute successful scientific missions while most of NASA’s attention and money was wasted on grandstanding with people. (In my opinion, JPL’s Deep Space Network continues to do more science that the International Space Station.)“There was no doubt in her mind or anyone else’s that if they’d gone ahead with their design and put a satellite at the helm and fuel in that final stage, their creation would be circling the earth at this very moment.” (September 2, 1956)See also Hidden Figures, the story behind the contemporary black women climbing an even steeper hill at NASA Langley Research Center (Hampton, Virginia). Don’t understand why neither were nominated for Hugo Awards as related works.“Proper paranoia.” Gentry Lee JPL’s frequent failures highlight the risk when pushing the envelope of the possible. Those now planning to send people to Mars should reflect on the low success rate of unmanned missions to the red planet. “We’re a sisterhood.”"

It takes the reader all the way back to when Malina, Parsons, and a young group of men were doing their own experiments in the foothills, all the way to the 1980's. Now, if you're looking to learn more about women's contribution to this industry, I suggest you read Hidden Figures For a book that is supposed to be about what women accomplished at JPL, it really sings the praises of the men. All I got from this book was that women were computers. It didn't go into any details though. But boy, did it tell us exactly what the men did. Plus for a book about science, I don't understand why women's fashion was a point that needed to be brought up. Yes, there was a female revolution going on, but what exactly does wearing pants have to do with sending a rocket into space? The book says their colleagues didn't care. So why bring up this inane topic in the first place?And don't get me started on the lady that felt sympathetic for a Nazi war criminal. I get that he contributed a lot to science. But.... let's not forget the 6 million people that died!! Their lives are more important to me than shooting metal hunks of debris into space. In conclusion, read Hidden Figures instead!!!!!

The biography is a collection of stories of women who overcame adversities to pursue jobs, men typically had and women could normally not hold. These courageous women were know as computers. They were the mathematicians of the Jet Proportion Laboratory known as JPL. They came from around the United States and even other countries. They held positions of prestige, which had long hours, poor conditions, and many risks, where lives were on the line if you made a mistake. Despite the conditions, the laboratory was a tight group and had multiple outside events together. For the women, they found a second home, a place where they could thrive and not have to hide their brilliance.I personally enjoyed learning about the women's lives and there experiences, inside and out of JPL. The insight of the outside world and knowledge about history I found fascinating.I had a distaste for how much the book mentioned the mechanics instead of the people in the book. I also had an aversion for how quickly characters were introduced, abscond and mentioned much later in the book without any previous reference. I found the book quite intriguing, but a little bland. I did however enjoy the stories, especially the ironic ones. I found the writing style suitable for the content of the book, but it made it slightly difficult to follow. It doesn't really move the reader to activism, it makes you frustrated, but you feel that it's in the past. I think people who enjoy factual writing this book is for them."

It follows both their work and their home lives. Of course, at their work early on, it was mostly women who were the calculators, while men were the engineers. As women of the time, they were expected to leave when/if they got married, then pregnant.I listened to the audio and my interest came and went. What I paid attention to was interesting. As we got closer to current times, with my (for a while) interest in astronomy, it was fun to read about some of those space missions that I remember. Well, the first one I really remember wasn’t a “fun” one, Challenger in 1986, but some of the later ones were: Hubble Space Telescope, Spirit and Opportunity (sent to Mars to take photos and explore; intended on only lasting 1 year on the planet, but lasted 5 and 10 years instead!), and more.

I was very interested in learning about these pioneering women and the men who supported them in their careers, and it didn’t disappoint on that front. I also learned A LOT about the space missions that I didn’t know. That being said, I got bogged down in the science at times and I was a scientist (albeit a geneticist, not a physicist or mathematician). I also found the story to jump around too much. I guess it was hard to tell all of these women’s stories without rehashing everything a million times but I kept getting lost. Maybe it is my corona brain. At the end of the day, I’m glad I read it but I was also counting down the pages for half the book, which isn’t exactly a glowing endorsement. "

77,0316338923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67951314-phrodrick,3,"Mine is a review of the large print edition, hard back of Nathalia Holt's Rise of the Rocket Girls. This is important because I found the large print edition particularly well bound, easy to read and easy to handle. It is rare that I notice anything about the binding of a book, but this edition does honor to the printer's art. The text however was less than it should have been. This is the history of the women who were the original computers at The Jet Propulsion Laboratory. As a former computer instructor, it always amazed me that most of my students had no clue that the word computer derives from the process of doing math, that people were employed as computers before there were machines to do the math, and that the machine is so named because what it does is math. What I did not know, until reading here is that hand done math had been the preferred method well into the space age. Ms. Holt makes it clear that by-hand calculations were just losing out to the machine about the time America was sending Apollo missions to the moon.What is now JPL began in the 1940’s as three collage age kids operating at great physical risk and minimal permission at Cal Tech. Being young and unsupervised they called themselves, The Suicide Squad. Their lack of safety procedures ultimately forced the school to push them out doors and away from campus. There they reformed as a business the JPL, The Jet Propulsion Laboratory.Their first income derived from their work for the US Army Air Corps developing the rocket engines used in JATO, Jet Assisted Take Off. These were basic jet engines strapped to propeller aircraft for the purpose of helping them launch quickly from short runways. The technique developed in WW II was still in use into the 1960's. Among the things that made JPL different was its willingness to employ women. In fact, the Computer department at JPL became a place where women, later including African American women could find professional level employment as advanced mathematicians. It is rarely appreciated that even in the 1940's and1950's women were able, if they were better than enough men to get advanced university training in mathematics. Most often the only work for them was as primary school teachers. However, there were places in various parts of the emerging world of what we now call High tech for women. It is now emerging that women had leading, if underappreciated roles in the development of Computers (the machines), and computer codes. Thanks to Ms Holt we know by name some of the women in the hard work of doing the math for the development of rocket engines.Returning to this book. I found Ms Holt writing to be vaguely under written. As if she was writing to a younger audience. Clearly, she was avoiding any detailed discussion of the math. Rather like describing how to make a complex menu item and avoiding all mention of the ingredients. Yes, math can be dull, but a better author can help you to share the frustrations and pleasure to be derived by the ability to handle complex math, under pressure and routinely produce reliable results. This is after all, rocket science. To most people this sounds dull. If your goal is to honor these women- and Ms. Holt wants us to honor them- and to inspire girls to follow, a few pages that detail the tedium and make clear the absolute demand for people up to this specialized set of challenges should have been better documented.What is best about the Rise of the Rocket Girls is that Ms. Holt sought out and interviewed the women who were the calculators. We see JPL progress from small military applications to the Apollo Launch pad. These women adapted to and took leadership roles in adapting the original desk calculators, capable of only a few mathematical processes replaced the slide rule. Later we get a worker’s point of view when the first generations of huge computers made hesitant, and cranky appearances before becoming the miracle machines we now barely think of - laptops, and smart phones and etc. These two generation of women learned how to program and master these machines. They are among the first rank of computer engineers. As exciting and inspirational as are the facts, Ms. Holt under serves them. She is given to name dropping. German, in fact ex Nazi Scientist Wernher von Braun, barely deserves his several mentions. Why she has to mention Carl Sagan is an open question. That there is a great deal about clothes, changing styles and the success or failure of their romantic lives may be part of telling “Her-Story” rather than “His-story”. A case can be made for mentions made the pants suits in the work place. But do we need the unrelated history of the invention of panty hose?The Rise of the Rocket Girls is an easy read. History for the casual, even the beach reader. But their work was anything but easy. Maybe asking more of the reader would have made this a better book. "
78,0316338923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4869474-jeane,4,"I really enjoyed this book for many reasons. First off, it was a great micro-history that focused on this historical women and the contributions to science and math and the entire space program, without them there would not have been one. Another reason I enjoyed this book is because my husband works at JPL and so many of the things they discuss in the book I am familiar with from his stories he comes home with. "
79,0316338923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3086584-shanon,5,I love this style of writing. Getting to hear the amazing historical story of how space exploration came to be while also learning about the women who made it possible and the intimate details of their lives is wonderful. This is an excellent book and very well written. 
80,0316338923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14909704-ari-santillanes,4,"One of the main reasons I read is something called ""book fate."" I suppose I should expand the term to something like ""reading fate,"" but here's the general idea: I believe that I have been fated - predestined - to encounter certain reading material at exactly the right time in my life. I do not believe in coincidences.My latest encounter with book fate involves Nathalia Holt's book, Rise of the Rocket Girls: The Women Who Propelled Us, From Missles to the Moon to Mars. The writing style left something to be desired, but the content enthralled me. It is the story of the women who dedicated their lives - certainly their life's work - to the Jet Propulsion Lab (JPL) as computers and engineers from the 1940s to present. I don't read many histories, so how did this one find its way into my hands?My dad gave it to me. He confessed it was a title he hoped to read, but because it was at the end of a long queue, he thought maybe I could read it first. Right there, postponing his own date with the book enabled me to have it at the right moment! On the subject of dads, I started reading the book near Father's Day, and one of the unifying characteristics of many of the women is the early loss of their fathers. They recounted childhoods where their mothers, in a time when it certainly wasn't the norm, supported several children through pure determination and strong work ethic. Though not directly stated, I can infer that this produced a drive in the women of JPL to support themselves. Through realistic depictions of struggle (depression, divorce, raising children and families), Holt shows how many of the women are determined to maintain their independence through work. I feel deeply connected to the women in this respect. I've never considered being a stay-at-home mom, though I tremendously respect the work such mothers do. When I have children of my own, I anticipate that Mat and I will work hard to make our professional commitments manageable alongside our family priorities. That scares me, because professional and filial fulfillment are things that I value, things that often compete. I appreciated reading the stories of women who pioneered the concept of a ""working mom"" and remained intimidated by its implications. It was my goal to get this book returned/loaned to my dad before I left for Anaheim. It's a hardback and I didn't want to carry it with me on a plane. But failing to finish it and with so little to go, it was impossible to leave it behind. This is how fate works; it is not always convenient. Once I made it to Anaheim, all I could think about was its proximity to Pasadena. I stared to wonder: Does JPL offer tours? Would the women engineers working there be flattered or resentful if I geeked out and asked them, fangirlishly, to sign my book so that when I return it to my dad, it has some sacred weight to it? Am I really, in a town where celebrity sightings can happen anytime, fantasizing about meeting more down-to-earth people who just so happen to champion exploration among the stars?The final fated alignment was that Sue Finley's last project was about to culminate on July 4th, when Juno arrives at Jupiter. Though I learned this in the book's Epilogue, I first heard it from Mat when we were flying to Anaheim. As we were waiting to board the plane, literally minutes away, he stepped out of our boarding group to check one more newsstand for a ""good magazine."" He returned with a Scientific American which, in addition to containing many other compelling stories (we may have to subscribe) contained one detailing Juno's mission. Of all the magazines in all the world, he had to choose the one that added to my book! As I read over his shoulder, 30-40,000 feet in the air, I marveled at the constellation of connections between my reading material and my life. "
81,0316338923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6496760-allison,5,"Really fascinating book. It's a great pairing with ""Hidden Figures"". This book as a bonus gives a history how the term ""computer"" went from being a job description to a thing we all use. I loved learning about how involved the women at JPL were in all the missions."
82,0316338923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9055933-judy,4,"This was one of those books that I wouldn't have read if it hadn't been for my book club. I'm glad I did. It isn't the story of getting a 'man' into space, like Hidden Figures and there is not 'civil rights' side to the story. This is the story of the smart women who worked in Pasadena at the Jet Propulsion Lab to build the rockets that would carry man to the moon and telescopes out to far away planets. It is also the story of the rise of the working woman who wanted a career and a family. These very bright women were gifted mathematicians and engineers in a time when girls weren't suppose to be good with numbers and most certainly not engineering. The author, Holt, focuses on a cluster of ladies who went to work at JPL just was WWII was winding down and stayed with the program until the turn of the century. The reader not only gets to know these precious ladies but gets a review of history from the rise of McCarthyism, to JFK's vision for our space program, to what we owe to it today. Women of a certain age will remember 'not being pregnant' at work and the debate over if 'we' could wear a pantsuit to work. For those who aren't up to keeping track of all the details about rocket propulsion, parts may be skimmed, but focus of these ladies and their wonderful friendships. The author does let you know what happened to each when their careers ended."

There is technical information that might be too much for the average reader and then, there were those who felt the author dealt too much with silly or sexist things about pageants and children or whatever made up these women's lives; (but isn’t that’s just it?), all the silly or sexist things made up the lives of our Rocket Girls. These women worked both outside the home in very demanding jobs and inside the home with husbands, children, family and society which is an all together different type of demanding yet extremely important job, and, at a time when women were considered an oddity if they worked apart from the home. I found this book captivating. There were moments when I wondered “why did the author put that there?” but then I realized those personal tidbits set apart from the highly technical and specialized positions spoken of were no less a part of these women and the times they were living in. This story tells about what the women went through to get to where we are today in engineering, space exploration, military weaponry and even our very own computer systems. These women adapted and struggled in order to make it in a man’s world but in my view and probably more important is the fact that each of these women enjoyed being women, and through it all were willing to sacrifice and strive for not only personal recognition and gain but also for the gain of future generations of women choosing to excel in mathematics and the sciences. This sisterhood remains strong in mutual respect and admiration because of their close knit working conditions and the friendships formed over time. Through the long hours endured and their strong, exacting work ethics they helped to achieve greatness and prosperity for our country first and foremost but also for a myriad of others who have taken what they started to the next levels.The author has written a fabulously warm-hearted and scientifically beautiful story of intelligent, witty and memorable first female engineers that deserves a top rank in your reading list. If you just couldn’t make it through the paper version I urge you to listen to the audiobook. Narrator Erin Bennett has provided a genuinely flawless production (well, there might have been a technical word or two she found difficult, but there’s not many who can say external disturbance-gravity gradient effect, magnetic-field torques, solar radiation and aerodynamic drag or radioisotope thermoelectric generator three times fast). Her voice was strong, easy to listen to and without excessive drama. Nathalia Holt brought the women to life but Erin Bennett took them off the page and let them live the past once again right before us.I hope you find this story as amazing and inspirational as I did.5 stars overall"

Hidden Figures: The American Dream and the Untold Story of the Black Women Mathematicians Who Helped Win the Space Race
, a book I desperately wanted to like because it is both so important and timely as well as the basis for an upcoming film which happens to look great ... but that other book, sadly, stumbled in several stylistic or organizational ways, which is not a problem here in Nathalia Holt's record of some different women who happened to be doing the same thing at the same time as their NASA counterparts as documented in Hidden Figures. But comparisons are doomed to fail; these books are attempting different things, and while Rise of the Rocket Girls doesn't pack the same punch in commentary on racism, it covers altogether different territory in its examination of the complex and ever-evolving relationship between motherhood (specifically) and work for these women computers. And it does so with clear organization, accessibility of language and thought, and a deft touch with the research. Complicated principles of orbital dynamics and so forth are woven in, yes, but always at the service of the narrative through-line, which tracks a slowly-changing group of women through the decades. Each section is organized around a handful of the larger group, and these women are highlighted gracefully and with care. The personal narrative voice breaks through occasionally, but not distractingly so. In short, stylistically, this is the book to read if you're looking for a primer on women computers in the space age; the content of other books like Hidden Figures may prove enlightening (and the jury's still out on the Junior edition of that book, which hasn't returned to my library yet) but they lack the energy and clarity of this book."
86,0316338923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34366105-lynette-caulkins,5,"Wow! Fantastic non-fiction read! In telling us the story about the women of the Jet Propulsion Lab, Holt brings us a the bonus of another angle of the rise and development of the space exploration era. This one peers at the history from outside Cape Canaveral/Kennedy, and thus provides a fuller understanding of how widespread the industry has been - there is so much more than ""just"" NASA. This book will appeal to a broad spectrum - men and women, older and youthful. While containing trivial memoir-style annecdotes that infuse the more technical discussions with personal interest and keep the book from getting heavy, it's not a Chick Lit piece that would bore someone like my husband (in fact, he's reading it now). (And don't take my words to indicate that he's a chauvinist, because he's no such thing, and he loves strong female characters - just, living in a house of all women and girls, he sometimes feels that certain books or movies have ""too much estrogen for me right now"". This book definitely will not do that for him.) The writing is very engaging, so no yawning over Holt's work. Rise leaves me wanting to find recent books about the planets and their moons, and wanting to find out more from my father about his time working on the Space Shuttle programming. The only way this book could be better is if the title used ""Women"" instead of the diminuizing ""Girls,"" as these were all very much adults, and highly accomplished and respected ones at that.Oh yeah, and now I'm going to play the recordings from Voyager's gold record while I make some minestrone soup. . . Thank you, Nathalia Holt, for one of those reads that pull your mind into its zone long after you've turned the last page. :) "
87,0316338923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5005999-victor-harris,2," Very uneven and got lost in the narrative it was trying to tell. It jumps between detailed discussions of - if you will - rocket science, to low-level prose almost geared to a high school audience. It had the annoying habit of repeating how tired the women were while holding a demanding full-time job and trying to raise children. Mentioning it once or twice would have clinched the point.  The nomenclature of the time is interesting. These brilliant women who were at the cutting edge of rocket, military, and space technology going back to the late 30s and early 40s, were actually designated as "" computers."" This was obviously before that word had taken on strictly a mechanical, technological connotation.  The most striking parts of this account were the descriptions of the multiple failures as America was finding it footing in the increasingly intense competition with the Soviet Union in the Space Race. It is remarkable how many of the misfires were a product of pure carelessness; often with tragic effects. A topic with a great deal of potential but the themes did not get adequately developed and frequently got mangled in the delivery. A low 2 rating."

Not only did I learn a lot about rocket and planetary science, but I felt like the women in this book, though we are separated by two generations, got me. They were trailblazers as women in science and math. They broke social norms of being working mothers when only 20% of women with small children worked. They paved the way for my generation to have what we have today. Yes, they were paid less and weren't allowed (at first) to be engineers; but, they made it possible for the rest of us. Special shout-out to the women who discriminated against men and only hired women to act as ""computers"" at the Jet Propulsion Lab (JPL). I had serious PTSD flashbacks to Mrs. Semro's geometry and algebra II when the author talked about using carbon paper while making computations. Also, thank you, Suicide Squad, turned JPL, for hiring a bunch of women.Bottom-line, every young woman should read this book. Had I read this book when I was younger, I may not have fallen victim to the stereotype of women in STEM. Read, read, read."

It had been 3 weeks since I had left the book at a friend's house, so I had to slog through the entire book out of some sense of committment. I am going to have to re-think committment to books. I wanted to give this book 2☆. Maybe I am being generous. Maybe I am grateful for a little more technical I formation about rockets and outer space and beginning-estimate (that's a word :-s) history of automated computers and rockets and space travel. Maybe because it is unfair to rate this book with Hidden Figures: The American Dream and the Untold Story of the Black Women Mathematicians Who Helped Win the Space Race felt sluggish to me.

I wish the book had gone into more depth - the writing style almost felt like it was aimed at very young readers and all the women were presented as basically the same person (pretty, liked numbers, joined JPL, married, had kids, left JPL, missed JPL, maybe came back) with no individual personality traits. Also, some women's stories were abruptly dropped at various points in the book, which was odd."

I am not a math/science person at all, but it was really cool to learn about the women ""computers"" whose handwritten formulas and calculations were the key to getting the US into the space race. I think any history buff would enjoy this one."

This time, unlike Hidden Figures, the action takes place on the West Coast. It could’ve been called the women of JPL. I feel like, as I continue to read more books about humanity’s odyssey beyond the earth, each one I read fills in more details. They are always compelling.This story focuses, of course on the female contribution to the space program, but it also tells much of the story of the work at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. This is not so much about sending astronauts into space but on the probes sent out to explore the planets, including the Voyagers and the Galileo and Cassini probes as well as the various missions to Mars and Venus. It’s a magnificent story.I love the fact that it also focuses to on the lives of the various women chronicled here. Personal lives are often left out of other histories, but they are huge part of the story. Just because you’re watching a greater history unfold doesn’t minimize what’s happening in your everyday life. This is a much more complete picture.I felt as though I got to know these women and like them as people. An intimate history. I highly recommend it."
93,0316338923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13239516-kara-of-bookishbytes,5,"The Rise of the Rocket Girls tells the story of a group of women who worked at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (or JPL) as human computers beginning in the 1940s. At that time, of course, computers--even calculators--were yet to be invented, so people had to do all mathematical calculations with pencil and paper. As rocket technology was being invented at JPL, all of the human calculators were women. They were smart, they were involved in the design and launch of spacecraft and their work was completely trusted by the male engineering staff. (Unfortunately, for decades, none of the women at JPL were given the title ""engineer"" even if their work was comparable to what the male engineers were doing. While most of the women highlighted in this book were never given a work title other than ""computer"", JPL did eventually recognize their indispensability and give them all of the human computers the title ""engineer"" regardless of their educational qualifications.)These women were also at the forefront of computer programming. As IBM developed electronic computers, the Rocket Girls trained in how to use them and there was a period of time (that appeared to last for many years) during which it seemed that the only computer programmers at JPL were women. I was surprised at the attitude that the author recounted of some of the male engineers who said they didn't trust the electronic computer's calculations--they wouldn't be confident until the women confirmed the results with pencil and paper. I almost can't imagine thinking a person could do math better than a computer. But that's how good these women were. (And also how uncertain people were of computer technology in its infancy.)Interwoven with the stories of rocket tests and trajectories are the personal stories of several of these remarkable women. They came from a range of backgrounds and it was wonderful to read about how different they all were--but how they all shared the drive to be excellent in their cutting edge work. Lots of girl power here, and no back-biting or malicious melodrama. I read a library copy of this book, but I've bought my own copy to have because I want my kids to all read this and I want to be able to pass it around to friends."
94,0316338923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3809399-stormin,4,"It's really hard not to compare this book directly with the (more famous) Hidden Figures: The American Dream and the Untold Story of the Black Women Mathematicians Who Helped Win the Space Race, and the conclusion is simple: Rise of the Rocket Girls is a better book.There are two main reasons for this. First, the book has a more concentrated narrative. Hidden Figures is all over the place, with long, long tangents that don't really go anywhere and no central narrative. It's more of an exhaustive index of things that happened in the lives of female, black computers than a story of any kind. By contrast, Rise of the Rocket Girls has much more accessible themes--like the desire of the female (white and black) computers to be a part of inventing rockets to explore space instead of just to deliver warheads and kill people.Second, the book had really great scientific explanations. I'm not a physicist or aerospace engineer or anything like that, but I do have a quantitative background with degrees in math, systems engineering, and economics. So I do know a thing or two about math, and so I can recognize a really good mathematical explanation when I see one. You know, the kind of explanation where the meaning is clear to anyone (regardless of their mathematical background) but the meaning is also faithful to the actual, technical concept being explained. That's really hard to do, and Nathalia Hold makes it look effortless. This make the book more fun to read, because you felt like you were getting a real feel for the kinds of scientific problems that these women were solving.I can easily imagine that the material in Hidden Figures made for a better movie (I haven't seen it yet), but as far as books go, this is the one I'd read if I had to pick just one."

That's something that isn't on record anywhere, and that history, particularly various anecdotes they may have from that time period, is very intriguing.But, yeesh. The way it was put together and the items the author chose to highlight drove me insane. I gave it two stars only because there are, in fact, good bits of information to be found. I do have to applaud the author for getting these women together again. But most of it felt like such a waste of a golden opportunity.The author spends the majority of the book talking about whichever ""rocket girl"" is being focused on and her hair, her clothes, her boyfriend/husband, her children, her troubles at home, etc. I'm sure that plays a part, but I really would have liked that to take more of a backseat. The interesting info about JPL felt more like asterisks at the bottom of the page.I majored in engineering, and I've worked for NASA. I've been the only female in many situations. I support giving these ladies a spotlight. I just think this book is so busy hamming up their gender that it forgets to fully illuminate their accomplishments. The idea isn't to say, ""Look, we're girls!"" The idea is to say, ""Yeah. We're awesome.""(Another book released recently, The Glass Universe: How the Ladies of the Harvard Observatory Took the Measure of the Stars does a much better job of this, for anyone interested. Though I warn it hits the other extreme for any not really keen on the subject. It is quite information and background heavy.)"

However, I just could not finish this book. It read as if it were an outline of chronological events with a few verbs and adjectives thrown in there. There was not one character that I felt tied to enough to want to finish the book. The author jumped from person to person, not developing one single character. So many names were dropped that I could not keep track of who was who. This barrage of women was punctuated by an attempt to connect the reader to them by telling brief, campy quips of detailed information about dresses, beauty pageants, and personal relationships. By trying to cover so much, the author truly did these amazing women a disservice with her poor writing. Had she taken the time to tell one or two stories really well, the book would really be able to celebrate the work of all of these amazing women."

But throughout the book, I felt that she was writing at a young adult level instead of an adult non-fiction level. I even checked the spine label to see if our library had designated the book in that way. I know a lot of adults like to read young adult books, but I am not one of them, so I found the tone simplistic and somewhat demeaning. I mean, seriously, I used to OPERATE a key punch machine.

98,0316338923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7029980-katie-doing-dewey,4,"Review: This was a fun read and highlighted some important work, but I would have liked more depth on the technical side of the story.Long before 'computers' were calculating machines, they were mathematicians (primarily women) and eventually the first software developers. Working at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, an elite group of female computers fought hard to balance personal lives with careers they loved at a time when that was still considered a highly unusual thing for a woman to do. Through their expertise and painstaking effort, these computers ""transformed rocket design, helped bring about the first American satellites, and made the exploration of the solar system possible"" (source).I was initially a bit disappointed by this book. The first story, focused on Barby Canright, spent a lot of time talking about her clothes, her makeup, and her relationships. That wouldn't bother me, except there were also very few technical details of her work and a lot of the story focused on one of the men she worked with. Fortunately, it got better from there. All of the other women's stories also talked about their relationships, but this was balanced by information about the work they did. I suspect that the bad beginning at least partially reflected the fact that earlier women computers were primarily doing math to implement other people's ideas. They weren't allowed to serve as engineers and were probably not often able to suggest experiments.Occasionally, I did still feel that the author was stereotyping the women, (for instance, an older women was put in charge of the group not because of her experience, but because she was 'a  mother hen') but overall the stories got better towards the end. I did really like that the author just told the women's stories, without digressing into discussions of stereotypes and the barriers they faced. She let their stories speak for themselves. And they were great stories! Like in 
Hidden Figures
, the author followed many women over decades, so we could see how many different women chose to balance their careers and how things changed over time. Many of the women worked on incredibly important space exploration efforts. The missions that gave us our first images of other planets were particularly awe-inspiring. Overall, I had a lot of fun reading this book. I just would have liked some more technical details to round it out!This review was originally posted on Doing Dewey"

Superb concept and research. Too bad the storytelling falls short. With so large a cast, Holt often fails to identify her frequent shifts of focus character. Even as an advocacy work, her biases bleed through too obviously. “As odd as it seems by today’s standards, the beauty contest was a result of JPL’s progressive hiring practices … unintentionally highlight the presence of educated young women working for JPL.”Even with its shortcomings this sets the record straight about the vital contributions of the “computers” as they were called before the advent of massive and micro-computers of the last fifty years. “She didn’t feel intimidated. Instead she felt invisible.” “Many saw the shuttle as competition.” It certainly contested budget dollars, if not official and public attention. JPL continued to plan and execute successful scientific missions while most of NASA’s attention and money was wasted on grandstanding with people. (In my opinion, JPL’s Deep Space Network continues to do more science that the International Space Station.)“There was no doubt in her mind or anyone else’s that if they’d gone ahead with their design and put a satellite at the helm and fuel in that final stage, their creation would be circling the earth at this very moment.” (September 2, 1956)See also Hidden Figures, the story behind the contemporary black women climbing an even steeper hill at NASA Langley Research Center (Hampton, Virginia). Don’t understand why neither were nominated for Hugo Awards as related works.“Proper paranoia.” Gentry Lee JPL’s frequent failures highlight the risk when pushing the envelope of the possible. Those now planning to send people to Mars should reflect on the low success rate of unmanned missions to the red planet. “We’re a sisterhood.”"

It takes the reader all the way back to when Malina, Parsons, and a young group of men were doing their own experiments in the foothills, all the way to the 1980's. Now, if you're looking to learn more about women's contribution to this industry, I suggest you read Hidden Figures For a book that is supposed to be about what women accomplished at JPL, it really sings the praises of the men. All I got from this book was that women were computers. It didn't go into any details though. But boy, did it tell us exactly what the men did. Plus for a book about science, I don't understand why women's fashion was a point that needed to be brought up. Yes, there was a female revolution going on, but what exactly does wearing pants have to do with sending a rocket into space? The book says their colleagues didn't care. So why bring up this inane topic in the first place?And don't get me started on the lady that felt sympathetic for a Nazi war criminal. I get that he contributed a lot to science. But.... let's not forget the 6 million people that died!! Their lives are more important to me than shooting metal hunks of debris into space. In conclusion, read Hidden Figures instead!!!!! It's superbly well-written and details the contributions of a handful of women in the space industry."
101,0316338923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64510958-tayler-card,3,"The book The Rise of the Rocket Girls by Nathalia Holt was the stories of revolutionary women who helped pave the way in modern rocketry. The biography is a collection of stories of women who overcame adversities to pursue jobs, men typically had and women could normally not hold. These courageous women were know as computers. They were the mathematicians of the Jet Proportion Laboratory known as JPL. They came from around the United States and even other countries. They held positions of prestige, which had long hours, poor conditions, and many risks, where lives were on the line if you made a mistake. Despite the conditions, the laboratory was a tight group and had multiple outside events together. For the women, they found a second home, a place where they could thrive and not have to hide their brilliance.I personally enjoyed learning about the women's lives and there experiences, inside and out of JPL. The insight of the outside world and knowledge about history I found fascinating.I had a distaste for how much the book mentioned the mechanics instead of the people in the book. I also had an aversion for how quickly characters were introduced, abscond and mentioned much later in the book without any previous reference. I found the book quite intriguing, but a little bland. I did however enjoy the stories, especially the ironic ones. I found the writing style suitable for the content of the book, but it made it slightly difficult to follow. It doesn't really move the reader to activism, it makes you frustrated, but you feel that it's in the past. I think people who enjoy factual writing this book is for them."
102,0316338923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12860715-librarycin,3,"This book follows some of the human calculators who worked for NASA (and the precursor to NASA), starting in the 1940s up to and including the 21st century. It follows both their work and their home lives. Of course, at their work early on, it was mostly women who were the calculators, while men were the engineers. As women of the time, they were expected to leave when/if they got married, then pregnant.I listened to the audio and my interest came and went. What I paid attention to was interesting. As we got closer to current times, with my (for a while) interest in astronomy, it was fun to read about some of those space missions that I remember. Well, the first one I really remember wasn’t a “fun” one, Challenger in 1986, but some of the later ones were: Hubble Space Telescope, Spirit and Opportunity (sent to Mars to take photos and explore; intended on only lasting 1 year on the planet, but lasted 5 and 10 years instead!), and more. Oh, I also enjoyed the one little tidbit of info about Jupiter’s moon Io (which I named my current oldest cat after) – apparently it is filled with volcanoes. "
103,0316338923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4922340-kathy,3,"This book was a mixed bag for me. I was very interested in learning about these pioneering women and the men who supported them in their careers, and it didn’t disappoint on that front. I also learned A LOT about the space missions that I didn’t know. That being said, I got bogged down in the science at times and I was a scientist (albeit a geneticist, not a physicist or mathematician). I also found the story to jump around too much. I guess it was hard to tell all of these women’s stories without rehashing everything a million times but I kept getting lost. Maybe it is my corona brain. At the end of the day, I’m glad I read it but I was also counting down the pages for half the book, which isn’t exactly a glowing endorsement. "
104,0316338923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91690914-katie,5,"I have been reading books about space and aviation my whole life, mostly written by men about men. I am happy to have found this book: about space (and science and engineering) but also about world history, and gender and familial expectations. The writing about science managed the appropriate balance of accuracy and plain-language, clearly-communicated simplicity. Looking at my bookshelf of male authors telling history about men, I am thrilled to have this story about successful women in aerospace."

106,0316338923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7233987-mary,5,"This was fascinating!!!! Not super science based so it was an easy read. Loved learning the background of these woman, and just learning about them in general. I'd definitely recommend, even if you aren't a huge space fan!"
107,0316338923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67951314-phrodrick,3,"Mine is a review of the large print edition, hard back of Nathalia Holt's Rise of the Rocket Girls. This is important because I found the large print edition particularly well bound, easy to read and easy to handle. It is rare that I notice anything about the binding of a book, but this edition does honor to the printer's art. The text however was less than it should have been. This is the history of the women who were the original computers at The Jet Propulsion Laboratory. As a former computer instructor, it always amazed me that most of my students had no clue that the word computer derives from the process of doing math, that people were employed as computers before there were machines to do the math, and that the machine is so named because what it does is math. What I did not know, until reading here is that hand done math had been the preferred method well into the space age. Ms. Holt makes it clear that by-hand calculations were just losing out to the machine about the time America was sending Apollo missions to the moon.What is now JPL began in the 1940’s as three collage age kids operating at great physical risk and minimal permission at Cal Tech. Being young and unsupervised they called themselves, The Suicide Squad. Their lack of safety procedures ultimately forced the school to push them out doors and away from campus. There they reformed as a business the JPL, The Jet Propulsion Laboratory.Their first income derived from their work for the US Army Air Corps developing the rocket engines used in JATO, Jet Assisted Take Off. These were basic jet engines strapped to propeller aircraft for the purpose of helping them launch quickly from short runways. The technique developed in WW II was still in use into the 1960's. Among the things that made JPL different was its willingness to employ women. In fact, the Computer department at JPL became a place where women, later including African American women could find professional level employment as advanced mathematicians. It is rarely appreciated that even in the 1940's and1950's women were able, if they were better than enough men to get advanced university training in mathematics. Most often the only work for them was as primary school teachers. However, there were places in various parts of the emerging world of what we now call High tech for women. It is now emerging that women had leading, if underappreciated roles in the development of Computers (the machines), and computer codes. Thanks to Ms Holt we know by name some of the women in the hard work of doing the math for the development of rocket engines.Returning to this book. I found Ms Holt writing to be vaguely under written. As if she was writing to a younger audience. Clearly, she was avoiding any detailed discussion of the math. Rather like describing how to make a complex menu item and avoiding all mention of the ingredients. Yes, math can be dull, but a better author can help you to share the frustrations and pleasure to be derived by the ability to handle complex math, under pressure and routinely produce reliable results. This is after all, rocket science. To most people this sounds dull. If your goal is to honor these women- and Ms. Holt wants us to honor them- and to inspire girls to follow, a few pages that detail the tedium and make clear the absolute demand for people up to this specialized set of challenges should have been better documented.What is best about the Rise of the Rocket Girls is that Ms. Holt sought out and interviewed the women who were the calculators. We see JPL progress from small military applications to the Apollo Launch pad. These women adapted to and took leadership roles in adapting the original desk calculators, capable of only a few mathematical processes replaced the slide rule. Later we get a worker’s point of view when the first generations of huge computers made hesitant, and cranky appearances before becoming the miracle machines we now barely think of - laptops, and smart phones and etc. These two generation of women learned how to program and master these machines. They are among the first rank of computer engineers. As exciting and inspirational as are the facts, Ms. Holt under serves them. She is given to name dropping. German, in fact ex Nazi Scientist Wernher von Braun, barely deserves his several mentions. Why she has to mention Carl Sagan is an open question. That there is a great deal about clothes, changing styles and the success or failure of their romantic lives may be part of telling “Her-Story” rather than “His-story”. A case can be made for mentions made the pants suits in the work place. But do we need the unrelated history of the invention of panty hose?The Rise of the Rocket Girls is an easy read. History for the casual, even the beach reader. But their work was anything but easy. Maybe asking more of the reader would have made this a better book. "
108,0316338923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4869474-jeane,4,"I really enjoyed this book for many reasons. First off, it was a great micro-history that focused on this historical women and the contributions to science and math and the entire space program, without them there would not have been one. Another reason I enjoyed this book is because my husband works at JPL and so many of the things they discuss in the book I am familiar with from his stories he comes home with. "
109,0316338923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3086584-shanon,5,I love this style of writing. Getting to hear the amazing historical story of how space exploration came to be while also learning about the women who made it possible and the intimate details of their lives is wonderful. This is an excellent book and very well written. 
110,0316338923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14909704-ari-santillanes,4,"One of the main reasons I read is something called ""book fate."" I suppose I should expand the term to something like ""reading fate,"" but here's the general idea: I believe that I have been fated - predestined - to encounter certain reading material at exactly the right time in my life. I do not believe in coincidences.My latest encounter with book fate involves Nathalia Holt's book, Rise of the Rocket Girls: The Women Who Propelled Us, From Missles to the Moon to Mars. The writing style left something to be desired, but the content enthralled me. It is the story of the women who dedicated their lives - certainly their life's work - to the Jet Propulsion Lab (JPL) as computers and engineers from the 1940s to present. I don't read many histories, so how did this one find its way into my hands?My dad gave it to me. He confessed it was a title he hoped to read, but because it was at the end of a long queue, he thought maybe I could read it first. Right there, postponing his own date with the book enabled me to have it at the right moment! On the subject of dads, I started reading the book near Father's Day, and one of the unifying characteristics of many of the women is the early loss of their fathers. They recounted childhoods where their mothers, in a time when it certainly wasn't the norm, supported several children through pure determination and strong work ethic. Though not directly stated, I can infer that this produced a drive in the women of JPL to support themselves. Through realistic depictions of struggle (depression, divorce, raising children and families), Holt shows how many of the women are determined to maintain their independence through work. I feel deeply connected to the women in this respect. I've never considered being a stay-at-home mom, though I tremendously respect the work such mothers do. When I have children of my own, I anticipate that Mat and I will work hard to make our professional commitments manageable alongside our family priorities. That scares me, because professional and filial fulfillment are things that I value, things that often compete. I appreciated reading the stories of women who pioneered the concept of a ""working mom"" and remained intimidated by its implications. It was my goal to get this book returned/loaned to my dad before I left for Anaheim. It's a hardback and I didn't want to carry it with me on a plane. But failing to finish it and with so little to go, it was impossible to leave it behind. This is how fate works; it is not always convenient. Once I made it to Anaheim, all I could think about was its proximity to Pasadena. I stared to wonder: Does JPL offer tours? Would the women engineers working there be flattered or resentful if I geeked out and asked them, fangirlishly, to sign my book so that when I return it to my dad, it has some sacred weight to it? Am I really, in a town where celebrity sightings can happen anytime, fantasizing about meeting more down-to-earth people who just so happen to champion exploration among the stars?The final fated alignment was that Sue Finley's last project was about to culminate on July 4th, when Juno arrives at Jupiter. Though I learned this in the book's Epilogue, I first heard it from Mat when we were flying to Anaheim. As we were waiting to board the plane, literally minutes away, he stepped out of our boarding group to check one more newsstand for a ""good magazine."" He returned with a Scientific American which, in addition to containing many other compelling stories (we may have to subscribe) contained one detailing Juno's mission. Of all the magazines in all the world, he had to choose the one that added to my book! As I read over his shoulder, 30-40,000 feet in the air, I marveled at the constellation of connections between my reading material and my life. "
111,0316338923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6496760-allison,5,"Really fascinating book. It's a great pairing with ""Hidden Figures"". This book as a bonus gives a history how the term ""computer"" went from being a job description to a thing we all use. I loved learning about how involved the women at JPL were in all the missions."
112,0316338923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9055933-judy,4,"This was one of those books that I wouldn't have read if it hadn't been for my book club. I'm glad I did. It isn't the story of getting a 'man' into space, like Hidden Figures and there is not 'civil rights' side to the story. This is the story of the smart women who worked in Pasadena at the Jet Propulsion Lab to build the rockets that would carry man to the moon and telescopes out to far away planets. It is also the story of the rise of the working woman who wanted a career and a family. These very bright women were gifted mathematicians and engineers in a time when girls weren't suppose to be good with numbers and most certainly not engineering. The author, Holt, focuses on a cluster of ladies who went to work at JPL just was WWII was winding down and stayed with the program until the turn of the century. The reader not only gets to know these precious ladies but gets a review of history from the rise of McCarthyism, to JFK's vision for our space program, to what we owe to it today. Women of a certain age will remember 'not being pregnant' at work and the debate over if 'we' could wear a pantsuit to work. For those who aren't up to keeping track of all the details about rocket propulsion, parts may be skimmed, but focus of these ladies and their wonderful friendships. The author does let you know what happened to each when their careers ended."

There is technical information that might be too much for the average reader and then, there were those who felt the author dealt too much with silly or sexist things about pageants and children or whatever made up these women's lives; (but isn’t that’s just it?), all the silly or sexist things made up the lives of our Rocket Girls. These women worked both outside the home in very demanding jobs and inside the home with husbands, children, family and society which is an all together different type of demanding yet extremely important job, and, at a time when women were considered an oddity if they worked apart from the home. I found this book captivating. There were moments when I wondered “why did the author put that there?” but then I realized those personal tidbits set apart from the highly technical and specialized positions spoken of were no less a part of these women and the times they were living in. This story tells about what the women went through to get to where we are today in engineering, space exploration, military weaponry and even our very own computer systems. These women adapted and struggled in order to make it in a man’s world but in my view and probably more important is the fact that each of these women enjoyed being women, and through it all were willing to sacrifice and strive for not only personal recognition and gain but also for the gain of future generations of women choosing to excel in mathematics and the sciences. This sisterhood remains strong in mutual respect and admiration because of their close knit working conditions and the friendships formed over time. Through the long hours endured and their strong, exacting work ethics they helped to achieve greatness and prosperity for our country first and foremost but also for a myriad of others who have taken what they started to the next levels.The author has written a fabulously warm-hearted and scientifically beautiful story of intelligent, witty and memorable first female engineers that deserves a top rank in your reading list. If you just couldn’t make it through the paper version I urge you to listen to the audiobook. Narrator Erin Bennett has provided a genuinely flawless production (well, there might have been a technical word or two she found difficult, but there’s not many who can say external disturbance-gravity gradient effect, magnetic-field torques, solar radiation and aerodynamic drag or radioisotope thermoelectric generator three times fast). Her voice was strong, easy to listen to and without excessive drama. Nathalia Holt brought the women to life but Erin Bennett took them off the page and let them live the past once again right before us.I hope you find this story as amazing and inspirational as I did.5 stars overall"

Hidden Figures: The American Dream and the Untold Story of the Black Women Mathematicians Who Helped Win the Space Race
, a book I desperately wanted to like because it is both so important and timely as well as the basis for an upcoming film which happens to look great ... but that other book, sadly, stumbled in several stylistic or organizational ways, which is not a problem here in Nathalia Holt's record of some different women who happened to be doing the same thing at the same time as their NASA counterparts as documented in Hidden Figures. But comparisons are doomed to fail; these books are attempting different things, and while Rise of the Rocket Girls doesn't pack the same punch in commentary on racism, it covers altogether different territory in its examination of the complex and ever-evolving relationship between motherhood (specifically) and work for these women computers. And it does so with clear organization, accessibility of language and thought, and a deft touch with the research. Complicated principles of orbital dynamics and so forth are woven in, yes, but always at the service of the narrative through-line, which tracks a slowly-changing group of women through the decades. Each section is organized around a handful of the larger group, and these women are highlighted gracefully and with care. The personal narrative voice breaks through occasionally, but not distractingly so. In short, stylistically, this is the book to read if you're looking for a primer on women computers in the space age; the content of other books like Hidden Figures may prove enlightening (and the jury's still out on the Junior edition of that book, which hasn't returned to my library yet) but they lack the energy and clarity of this book."
116,0316338923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34366105-lynette-caulkins,5,"Wow! Fantastic non-fiction read! In telling us the story about the women of the Jet Propulsion Lab, Holt brings us a the bonus of another angle of the rise and development of the space exploration era. This one peers at the history from outside Cape Canaveral/Kennedy, and thus provides a fuller understanding of how widespread the industry has been - there is so much more than ""just"" NASA. This book will appeal to a broad spectrum - men and women, older and youthful. While containing trivial memoir-style annecdotes that infuse the more technical discussions with personal interest and keep the book from getting heavy, it's not a Chick Lit piece that would bore someone like my husband (in fact, he's reading it now). (And don't take my words to indicate that he's a chauvinist, because he's no such thing, and he loves strong female characters - just, living in a house of all women and girls, he sometimes feels that certain books or movies have ""too much estrogen for me right now"". This book definitely will not do that for him.) The writing is very engaging, so no yawning over Holt's work. Rise leaves me wanting to find recent books about the planets and their moons, and wanting to find out more from my father about his time working on the Space Shuttle programming. The only way this book could be better is if the title used ""Women"" instead of the diminuizing ""Girls,"" as these were all very much adults, and highly accomplished and respected ones at that.Oh yeah, and now I'm going to play the recordings from Voyager's gold record while I make some minestrone soup. . . Thank you, Nathalia Holt, for one of those reads that pull your mind into its zone long after you've turned the last page. :) "
117,0316338923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5005999-victor-harris,2," Very uneven and got lost in the narrative it was trying to tell. It jumps between detailed discussions of - if you will - rocket science, to low-level prose almost geared to a high school audience. It had the annoying habit of repeating how tired the women were while holding a demanding full-time job and trying to raise children. Mentioning it once or twice would have clinched the point.  The nomenclature of the time is interesting. These brilliant women who were at the cutting edge of rocket, military, and space technology going back to the late 30s and early 40s, were actually designated as "" computers."" This was obviously before that word had taken on strictly a mechanical, technological connotation.  The most striking parts of this account were the descriptions of the multiple failures as America was finding it footing in the increasingly intense competition with the Soviet Union in the Space Race. It is remarkable how many of the misfires were a product of pure carelessness; often with tragic effects. A topic with a great deal of potential but the themes did not get adequately developed and frequently got mangled in the delivery. A low 2 rating."
118,0316338923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4403212-amber,5,"Anyone who talked to me in any capacity in the week I listened to this book heard me sing its praises. Not only did I learn a lot about rocket and planetary science, but I felt like the women in this book, though we are separated by two generations, got me. They were trailblazers as women in science and math. They broke social norms of being working mothers when only 20% of women with small children worked. They paved the way for my generation to have what we have today. Yes, they were paid less and weren't allowed (at first) to be engineers; but, they made it possible for the rest of us. Special shout-out to the women who discriminated against men and only hired women to act as ""computers"" at the Jet Propulsion Lab (JPL). I had serious PTSD flashbacks to Mrs. Semro's geometry and algebra II when the author talked about using carbon paper while making computations. Also, thank you, Suicide Squad, turned JPL, for hiring a bunch of women.Bottom-line, every young woman should read this book. Had I read this book when I was younger, I may not have fallen victim to the stereotype of women in STEM. Read, read, read."

It had been 3 weeks since I had left the book at a friend's house, so I had to slog through the entire book out of some sense of committment. I am going to have to re-think committment to books. I wanted to give this book 2☆. Maybe I am being generous. Maybe I am grateful for a little more technical I formation about rockets and outer space and beginning-estimate (that's a word :-s) history of automated computers and rockets and space travel.

I wish the book had gone into more depth - the writing style almost felt like it was aimed at very young readers and all the women were presented as basically the same person (pretty, liked numbers, joined JPL, married, had kids, left JPL, missed JPL, maybe came back) with no individual personality traits. Also, some women's stories were abruptly dropped at various points in the book, which was odd."

I am not a math/science person at all, but it was really cool to learn about the women ""computers"" whose handwritten formulas and calculations were the key to getting the US into the space race. I think any history buff would enjoy this one."

This time, unlike Hidden Figures, the action takes place on the West Coast. It could’ve been called the women of JPL. I feel like, as I continue to read more books about humanity’s odyssey beyond the earth, each one I read fills in more details. They are always compelling.This story focuses, of course on the female contribution to the space program, but it also tells much of the story of the work at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. This is not so much about sending astronauts into space but on the probes sent out to explore the planets, including the Voyagers and the Galileo and Cassini probes as well as the various missions to Mars and Venus. It’s a magnificent story.I love the fact that it also focuses to on the lives of the various women chronicled here. Personal lives are often left out of other histories, but they are huge part of the story. Just because you’re watching a greater history unfold doesn’t minimize what’s happening in your everyday life. This is a much more complete picture.I felt as though I got to know these women and like them as people. An intimate history. I highly recommend it."
123,0316338923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13239516-kara-of-bookishbytes,5,"The Rise of the Rocket Girls tells the story of a group of women who worked at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (or JPL) as human computers beginning in the 1940s. At that time, of course, computers--even calculators--were yet to be invented, so people had to do all mathematical calculations with pencil and paper. As rocket technology was being invented at JPL, all of the human calculators were women. They were smart, they were involved in the design and launch of spacecraft and their work was completely trusted by the male engineering staff. (Unfortunately, for decades, none of the women at JPL were given the title ""engineer"" even if their work was comparable to what the male engineers were doing. While most of the women highlighted in this book were never given a work title other than ""computer"", JPL did eventually recognize their indispensability and give them all of the human computers the title ""engineer"" regardless of their educational qualifications.)These women were also at the forefront of computer programming. As IBM developed electronic computers, the Rocket Girls trained in how to use them and there was a period of time (that appeared to last for many years) during which it seemed that the only computer programmers at JPL were women. I was surprised at the attitude that the author recounted of some of the male engineers who said they didn't trust the electronic computer's calculations--they wouldn't be confident until the women confirmed the results with pencil and paper. I almost can't imagine thinking a person could do math better than a computer. But that's how good these women were. (And also how uncertain people were of computer technology in its infancy.)Interwoven with the stories of rocket tests and trajectories are the personal stories of several of these remarkable women. They came from a range of backgrounds and it was wonderful to read about how different they all were--but how they all shared the drive to be excellent in their cutting edge work. Lots of girl power here, and no back-biting or malicious melodrama. I read a library copy of this book, but I've bought my own copy to have because I want my kids to all read this and I want to be able to pass it around to friends."
124,0316338923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3809399-stormin,4,"It's really hard not to compare this book directly with the (more famous) Hidden Figures: The American Dream and the Untold Story of the Black Women Mathematicians Who Helped Win the Space Race, and the conclusion is simple: Rise of the Rocket Girls is a better book.There are two main reasons for this. First, the book has a more concentrated narrative. Hidden Figures is all over the place, with long, long tangents that don't really go anywhere and no central narrative. It's more of an exhaustive index of things that happened in the lives of female, black computers than a story of any kind. By contrast, Rise of the Rocket Girls has much more accessible themes--like the desire of the female (white and black) computers to be a part of inventing rockets to explore space instead of just to deliver warheads and kill people.Second, the book had really great scientific explanations. I'm not a physicist or aerospace engineer or anything like that, but I do have a quantitative background with degrees in math, systems engineering, and economics. So I do know a thing or two about math, and so I can recognize a really good mathematical explanation when I see one. You know, the kind of explanation where the meaning is clear to anyone (regardless of their mathematical background) but the meaning is also faithful to the actual, technical concept being explained. That's really hard to do, and Nathalia Hold makes it look effortless. This make the book more fun to read, because you felt like you were getting a real feel for the kinds of scientific problems that these women were solving.I can easily imagine that the material in Hidden Figures made for a better movie (I haven't seen it yet), but as far as books go, this is the one I'd read if I had to pick just one."
125,0316338923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/55339687-linds,2,"Yuck.To me, it is nearly invaluable that someone took the initiative to track down the surviving JPL 'human computers' and get their stories. That's something that isn't on record anywhere, and that history, particularly various anecdotes they may have from that time period, is very intriguing.But, yeesh. The way it was put together and the items the author chose to highlight drove me insane. I gave it two stars only because there are, in fact, good bits of information to be found. I do have to applaud the author for getting these women together again. But most of it felt like such a waste of a golden opportunity.The author spends the majority of the book talking about whichever ""rocket girl"" is being focused on and her hair, her clothes, her boyfriend/husband, her children, her troubles at home, etc. I'm sure that plays a part, but I really would have liked that to take more of a backseat. The interesting info about JPL felt more like asterisks at the bottom of the page.I majored in engineering, and I've worked for NASA. I've been the only female in many situations. I support giving these ladies a spotlight. I just think this book is so busy hamming up their gender that it forgets to fully illuminate their accomplishments. The idea isn't to say, ""Look, we're girls!"" The idea is to say, ""Yeah. We're awesome.""(Another book released recently, The Glass Universe: How the Ladies of the Harvard Observatory Took the Measure of the Stars does a much better job of this, for anyone interested. Though I warn it hits the other extreme for any not really keen on the subject. It is quite information and background heavy.)"

However, I just could not finish this book. It read as if it were an outline of chronological events with a few verbs and adjectives thrown in there. There was not one character that I felt tied to enough to want to finish the book. The author jumped from person to person, not developing one single character. So many names were dropped that I could not keep track of who was who. This barrage of women was punctuated by an attempt to connect the reader to them by telling brief, campy quips of detailed information about dresses, beauty pageants, and personal relationships. By trying to cover so much, the author truly did these amazing women a disservice with her poor writing. Had she taken the time to tell one or two stories really well, the book would really be able to celebrate the work of all of these amazing women."
127,0316338923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32637832-anne,3,"The author had obviously done a lot of research, and I really liked that she was able to explain a lot of the STEM stuff so that even an anti-STEM person like me could understand it. But throughout the book, I felt that she was writing at a young adult level instead of an adult non-fiction level. I even checked the spine label to see if our library had designated the book in that way. I know a lot of adults like to read young adult books, but I am not one of them, so I found the tone simplistic and somewhat demeaning. I mean, seriously, I used to OPERATE a key punch machine. I know what one is. "
128,0316338923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7029980-katie-doing-dewey,4,"Review: This was a fun read and highlighted some important work, but I would have liked more depth on the technical side of the story.Long before 'computers' were calculating machines, they were mathematicians (primarily women) and eventually the first software developers. Working at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, an elite group of female computers fought hard to balance personal lives with careers they loved at a time when that was still considered a highly unusual thing for a woman to do. Through their expertise and painstaking effort, these computers ""transformed rocket design, helped bring about the first American satellites, and made the exploration of the solar system possible"" (source).I was initially a bit disappointed by this book. The first story, focused on Barby Canright, spent a lot of time talking about her clothes, her makeup, and her relationships. That wouldn't bother me, except there were also very few technical details of her work and a lot of the story focused on one of the men she worked with. Fortunately, it got better from there. All of the other women's stories also talked about their relationships, but this was balanced by information about the work they did. I suspect that the bad beginning at least partially reflected the fact that earlier women computers were primarily doing math to implement other people's ideas. They weren't allowed to serve as engineers and were probably not often able to suggest experiments.Occasionally, I did still feel that the author was stereotyping the women, (for instance, an older women was put in charge of the group not because of her experience, but because she was 'a  mother hen') but overall the stories got better towards the end. I did really like that the author just told the women's stories, without digressing into discussions of stereotypes and the barriers they faced. She let their stories speak for themselves. And they were great stories! Like in 
Hidden Figures
, the author followed many women over decades, so we could see how many different women chose to balance their careers and how things changed over time. Many of the women worked on incredibly important space exploration efforts. The missions that gave us our first images of other planets were particularly awe-inspiring. Overall, I had a lot of fun reading this book. I just would have liked some more technical details to round it out!This review was originally posted on Doing Dewey"
129,0316338923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1256262-ron,4,"“Engineers make up the problems and we solve them.” Helen LingDespite the cringe-worthy title, an excellent history of the women who contributed to the unique successes of Caltech’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). Superb concept and research. Too bad the storytelling falls short. With so large a cast, Holt often fails to identify her frequent shifts of focus character. Even as an advocacy work, her biases bleed through too obviously. “As odd as it seems by today’s standards, the beauty contest was a result of JPL’s progressive hiring practices … unintentionally highlight the presence of educated young women working for JPL.”Even with its shortcomings this sets the record straight about the vital contributions of the “computers” as they were called before the advent of massive and micro-computers of the last fifty years. “She didn’t feel intimidated. Instead she felt invisible.” “Many saw the shuttle as competition.” It certainly contested budget dollars, if not official and public attention. JPL continued to plan and execute successful scientific missions while most of NASA’s attention and money was wasted on grandstanding with people. (In my opinion, JPL’s Deep Space Network continues to do more science that the International Space Station.)“There was no doubt in her mind or anyone else’s that if they’d gone ahead with their design and put a satellite at the helm and fuel in that final stage, their creation would be circling the earth at this very moment.” (September 2, 1956)See also Hidden Figures, the story behind the contemporary black women climbing an even steeper hill at NASA Langley Research Center (Hampton, Virginia). Don’t understand why neither were nominated for Hugo Awards as related works.“Proper paranoia.” Gentry Lee JPL’s frequent failures highlight the risk when pushing the envelope of the possible. Those now planning to send people to Mars should reflect on the low success rate of unmanned missions to the red planet. “We’re a sisterhood.”"

It takes the reader all the way back to when Malina, Parsons, and a young group of men were doing their own experiments in the foothills, all the way to the 1980's. Now, if you're looking to learn more about women's contribution to this industry, I suggest you read Hidden Figures For a book that is supposed to be about what women accomplished at JPL, it really sings the praises of the men. All I got from this book was that women were computers. It didn't go into any details though. But boy, did it tell us exactly what the men did. Plus for a book about science, I don't understand why women's fashion was a point that needed to be brought up. Yes, there was a female revolution going on, but what exactly does wearing pants have to do with sending a rocket into space? The book says their colleagues didn't care. So why bring up this inane topic in the first place?And don't get me started on the lady that felt sympathetic for a Nazi war criminal. I get that he contributed a lot to science. But.... let's not forget the 6 million people that died!! Their lives are more important to me than shooting metal hunks of debris into space. In conclusion, read Hidden Figures instead!!!!! It's superbly well-written and details the contributions of a handful of women in the space industry."
131,0316338923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64510958-tayler-card,3,"The book The Rise of the Rocket Girls by Nathalia Holt was the stories of revolutionary women who helped pave the way in modern rocketry. The biography is a collection of stories of women who overcame adversities to pursue jobs, men typically had and women could normally not hold. These courageous women were know as computers. They were the mathematicians of the Jet Proportion Laboratory known as JPL. They came from around the United States and even other countries. They held positions of prestige, which had long hours, poor conditions, and many risks, where lives were on the line if you made a mistake. Despite the conditions, the laboratory was a tight group and had multiple outside events together. For the women, they found a second home, a place where they could thrive and not have to hide their brilliance.I personally enjoyed learning about the women's lives and there experiences, inside and out of JPL. The insight of the outside world and knowledge about history I found fascinating.I had a distaste for how much the book mentioned the mechanics instead of the people in the book. I also had an aversion for how quickly characters were introduced, abscond and mentioned much later in the book without any previous reference. I found the book quite intriguing, but a little bland. I did however enjoy the stories, especially the ironic ones. I found the writing style suitable for the content of the book, but it made it slightly difficult to follow. It doesn't really move the reader to activism, it makes you frustrated, but you feel that it's in the past. I think people who enjoy factual writing this book is for them."
132,0316338923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12860715-librarycin,3,"This book follows some of the human calculators who worked for NASA (and the precursor to NASA), starting in the 1940s up to and including the 21st century. It follows both their work and their home lives. Of course, at their work early on, it was mostly women who were the calculators, while men were the engineers. As women of the time, they were expected to leave when/if they got married, then pregnant.I listened to the audio and my interest came and went. What I paid attention to was interesting. As we got closer to current times, with my (for a while) interest in astronomy, it was fun to read about some of those space missions that I remember. Well, the first one I really remember wasn’t a “fun” one, Challenger in 1986, but some of the later ones were: Hubble Space Telescope, Spirit and Opportunity (sent to Mars to take photos and explore; intended on only lasting 1 year on the planet, but lasted 5 and 10 years instead!), and more. Oh, I also enjoyed the one little tidbit of info about Jupiter’s moon Io (which I named my current oldest cat after) – apparently it is filled with volcanoes. "
133,0316338923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4922340-kathy,3,"This book was a mixed bag for me. I was very interested in learning about these pioneering women and the men who supported them in their careers, and it didn’t disappoint on that front. I also learned A LOT about the space missions that I didn’t know. That being said, I got bogged down in the science at times and I was a scientist (albeit a geneticist, not a physicist or mathematician). I also found the story to jump around too much. I guess it was hard to tell all of these women’s stories without rehashing everything a million times but I kept getting lost. Maybe it is my corona brain. At the end of the day, I’m glad I read it but I was also counting down the pages for half the book, which isn’t exactly a glowing endorsement. "

The writing about science managed the appropriate balance of accuracy and plain-language, clearly-communicated simplicity. Looking at my bookshelf of male authors telling history about men, I am thrilled to have this story about successful women in aerospace."

137,0316338923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67951314-phrodrick,3,"Mine is a review of the large print edition, hard back of Nathalia Holt's Rise of the Rocket Girls. This is important because I found the large print edition particularly well bound, easy to read and easy to handle. It is rare that I notice anything about the binding of a book, but this edition does honor to the printer's art. The text however was less than it should have been. This is the history of the women who were the original computers at The Jet Propulsion Laboratory. As a former computer instructor, it always amazed me that most of my students had no clue that the word computer derives from the process of doing math, that people were employed as computers before there were machines to do the math, and that the machine is so named because what it does is math. What I did not know, until reading here is that hand done math had been the preferred method well into the space age. Ms. Holt makes it clear that by-hand calculations were just losing out to the machine about the time America was sending Apollo missions to the moon.What is now JPL began in the 1940’s as three collage age kids operating at great physical risk and minimal permission at Cal Tech. Being young and unsupervised they called themselves, The Suicide Squad. Their lack of safety procedures ultimately forced the school to push them out doors and away from campus. There they reformed as a business the JPL, The Jet Propulsion Laboratory.Their first income derived from their work for the US Army Air Corps developing the rocket engines used in JATO, Jet Assisted Take Off. These were basic jet engines strapped to propeller aircraft for the purpose of helping them launch quickly from short runways. The technique developed in WW II was still in use into the 1960's. Among the things that made JPL different was its willingness to employ women. In fact, the Computer department at JPL became a place where women, later including African American women could find professional level employment as advanced mathematicians. It is rarely appreciated that even in the 1940's and1950's women were able, if they were better than enough men to get advanced university training in mathematics. Most often the only work for them was as primary school teachers. However, there were places in various parts of the emerging world of what we now call High tech for women. It is now emerging that women had leading, if underappreciated roles in the development of Computers (the machines), and computer codes. Thanks to Ms Holt we know by name some of the women in the hard work of doing the math for the development of rocket engines.Returning to this book. I found Ms Holt writing to be vaguely under written. As if she was writing to a younger audience. Clearly, she was avoiding any detailed discussion of the math. Rather like describing how to make a complex menu item and avoiding all mention of the ingredients. Yes, math can be dull, but a better author can help you to share the frustrations and pleasure to be derived by the ability to handle complex math, under pressure and routinely produce reliable results. This is after all, rocket science. To most people this sounds dull. If your goal is to honor these women- and Ms. Holt wants us to honor them- and to inspire girls to follow, a few pages that detail the tedium and make clear the absolute demand for people up to this specialized set of challenges should have been better documented.What is best about the Rise of the Rocket Girls is that Ms. Holt sought out and interviewed the women who were the calculators. We see JPL progress from small military applications to the Apollo Launch pad. These women adapted to and took leadership roles in adapting the original desk calculators, capable of only a few mathematical processes replaced the slide rule. Later we get a worker’s point of view when the first generations of huge computers made hesitant, and cranky appearances before becoming the miracle machines we now barely think of - laptops, and smart phones and etc. These two generation of women learned how to program and master these machines. They are among the first rank of computer engineers. As exciting and inspirational as are the facts, Ms. Holt under serves them. She is given to name dropping. German, in fact ex Nazi Scientist Wernher von Braun, barely deserves his several mentions. Why she has to mention Carl Sagan is an open question. That there is a great deal about clothes, changing styles and the success or failure of their romantic lives may be part of telling “Her-Story” rather than “His-story”. A case can be made for mentions made the pants suits in the work place. But do we need the unrelated history of the invention of panty hose?The Rise of the Rocket Girls is an easy read. History for the casual, even the beach reader. But their work was anything but easy. Maybe asking more of the reader would have made this a better book. "
138,0316338923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4869474-jeane,4,"I really enjoyed this book for many reasons. First off, it was a great micro-history that focused on this historical women and the contributions to science and math and the entire space program, without them there would not have been one. Another reason I enjoyed this book is because my husband works at JPL and so many of the things they discuss in the book I am familiar with from his stories he comes home with. "
139,0316338923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3086584-shanon,5,I love this style of writing. Getting to hear the amazing historical story of how space exploration came to be while also learning about the women who made it possible and the intimate details of their lives is wonderful. This is an excellent book and very well written. 
140,0316338923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14909704-ari-santillanes,4,"One of the main reasons I read is something called ""book fate."" I suppose I should expand the term to something like ""reading fate,"" but here's the general idea: I believe that I have been fated - predestined - to encounter certain reading material at exactly the right time in my life. I do not believe in coincidences.My latest encounter with book fate involves Nathalia Holt's book, Rise of the Rocket Girls: The Women Who Propelled Us, From Missles to the Moon to Mars. The writing style left something to be desired, but the content enthralled me. It is the story of the women who dedicated their lives - certainly their life's work - to the Jet Propulsion Lab (JPL) as computers and engineers from the 1940s to present. I don't read many histories, so how did this one find its way into my hands?My dad gave it to me. He confessed it was a title he hoped to read, but because it was at the end of a long queue, he thought maybe I could read it first. Right there, postponing his own date with the book enabled me to have it at the right moment! On the subject of dads, I started reading the book near Father's Day, and one of the unifying characteristics of many of the women is the early loss of their fathers. They recounted childhoods where their mothers, in a time when it certainly wasn't the norm, supported several children through pure determination and strong work ethic. Though not directly stated, I can infer that this produced a drive in the women of JPL to support themselves. Through realistic depictions of struggle (depression, divorce, raising children and families), Holt shows how many of the women are determined to maintain their independence through work. I feel deeply connected to the women in this respect. I've never considered being a stay-at-home mom, though I tremendously respect the work such mothers do. When I have children of my own, I anticipate that Mat and I will work hard to make our professional commitments manageable alongside our family priorities. That scares me, because professional and filial fulfillment are things that I value, things that often compete. I appreciated reading the stories of women who pioneered the concept of a ""working mom"" and remained intimidated by its implications. It was my goal to get this book returned/loaned to my dad before I left for Anaheim. It's a hardback and I didn't want to carry it with me on a plane. But failing to finish it and with so little to go, it was impossible to leave it behind. This is how fate works; it is not always convenient. Once I made it to Anaheim, all I could think about was its proximity to Pasadena. I stared to wonder: Does JPL offer tours? Would the women engineers working there be flattered or resentful if I geeked out and asked them, fangirlishly, to sign my book so that when I return it to my dad, it has some sacred weight to it? Am I really, in a town where celebrity sightings can happen anytime, fantasizing about meeting more down-to-earth people who just so happen to champion exploration among the stars?The final fated alignment was that Sue Finley's last project was about to culminate on July 4th, when Juno arrives at Jupiter. Though I learned this in the book's Epilogue, I first heard it from Mat when we were flying to Anaheim. As we were waiting to board the plane, literally minutes away, he stepped out of our boarding group to check one more newsstand for a ""good magazine."" He returned with a Scientific American which, in addition to containing many other compelling stories (we may have to subscribe) contained one detailing Juno's mission. Of all the magazines in all the world, he had to choose the one that added to my book! As I read over his shoulder, 30-40,000 feet in the air, I marveled at the constellation of connections between my reading material and my life. "

142,0316338923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9055933-judy,4,"This was one of those books that I wouldn't have read if it hadn't been for my book club. I'm glad I did. It isn't the story of getting a 'man' into space, like Hidden Figures and there is not 'civil rights' side to the story. This is the story of the smart women who worked in Pasadena at the Jet Propulsion Lab to build the rockets that would carry man to the moon and telescopes out to far away planets. It is also the story of the rise of the working woman who wanted a career and a family. These very bright women were gifted mathematicians and engineers in a time when girls weren't suppose to be good with numbers and most certainly not engineering. The author, Holt, focuses on a cluster of ladies who went to work at JPL just was WWII was winding down and stayed with the program until the turn of the century. The reader not only gets to know these precious ladies but gets a review of history from the rise of McCarthyism, to JFK's vision for our space program, to what we owe to it today. Women of a certain age will remember 'not being pregnant' at work and the debate over if 'we' could wear a pantsuit to work. For those who aren't up to keeping track of all the details about rocket propulsion, parts may be skimmed, but focus of these ladies and their wonderful friendships. The author does let you know what happened to each when their careers ended."

There is technical information that might be too much for the average reader and then, there were those who felt the author dealt too much with silly or sexist things about pageants and children or whatever made up these women's lives; (but isn’t that’s just it?), all the silly or sexist things made up the lives of our Rocket Girls. These women worked both outside the home in very demanding jobs and inside the home with husbands, children, family and society which is an all together different type of demanding yet extremely important job, and, at a time when women were considered an oddity if they worked apart from the home. I found this book captivating. There were moments when I wondered “why did the author put that there?” but then I realized those personal tidbits set apart from the highly technical and specialized positions spoken of were no less a part of these women and the times they were living in. This story tells about what the women went through to get to where we are today in engineering, space exploration, military weaponry and even our very own computer systems. These women adapted and struggled in order to make it in a man’s world but in my view and probably more important is the fact that each of these women enjoyed being women, and through it all were willing to sacrifice and strive for not only personal recognition and gain but also for the gain of future generations of women choosing to excel in mathematics and the sciences. This sisterhood remains strong in mutual respect and admiration because of their close knit working conditions and the friendships formed over time. Through the long hours endured and their strong, exacting work ethics they helped to achieve greatness and prosperity for our country first and foremost but also for a myriad of others who have taken what they started to the next levels.The author has written a fabulously warm-hearted and scientifically beautiful story of intelligent, witty and memorable first female engineers that deserves a top rank in your reading list. If you just couldn’t make it through the paper version I urge you to listen to the audiobook. Narrator Erin Bennett has provided a genuinely flawless production (well, there might have been a technical word or two she found difficult, but there’s not many who can say external disturbance-gravity gradient effect, magnetic-field torques, solar radiation and aerodynamic drag or radioisotope thermoelectric generator three times fast). Her voice was strong, easy to listen to and without excessive drama. Nathalia Holt brought the women to life but Erin Bennett took them off the page and let them live the past once again right before us.I hope you find this story as amazing and inspirational as I did.5 stars overall"

Hidden Figures: The American Dream and the Untold Story of the Black Women Mathematicians Who Helped Win the Space Race
, a book I desperately wanted to like because it is both so important and timely as well as the basis for an upcoming film which happens to look great ... but that other book, sadly, stumbled in several stylistic or organizational ways, which is not a problem here in Nathalia Holt's record of some different women who happened to be doing the same thing at the same time as their NASA counterparts as documented in Hidden Figures. But comparisons are doomed to fail; these books are attempting different things, and while Rise of the Rocket Girls doesn't pack the same punch in commentary on racism, it covers altogether different territory in its examination of the complex and ever-evolving relationship between motherhood (specifically) and work for these women computers. And it does so with clear organization, accessibility of language and thought, and a deft touch with the research. Complicated principles of orbital dynamics and so forth are woven in, yes, but always at the service of the narrative through-line, which tracks a slowly-changing group of women through the decades. Each section is organized around a handful of the larger group, and these women are highlighted gracefully and with care. The personal narrative voice breaks through occasionally, but not distractingly so. In short, stylistically, this is the book to read if you're looking for a primer on women computers in the space age; the content of other books like Hidden Figures may prove enlightening (and the jury's still out on the Junior edition of that book, which hasn't returned to my library yet) but they lack the energy and clarity of this book."

In telling us the story about the women of the Jet Propulsion Lab, Holt brings us a the bonus of another angle of the rise and development of the space exploration era. This one peers at the history from outside Cape Canaveral/Kennedy, and thus provides a fuller understanding of how widespread the industry has been - there is so much more than ""just"" NASA. This book will appeal to a broad spectrum - men and women, older and youthful. While containing trivial memoir-style annecdotes that infuse the more technical discussions with personal interest and keep the book from getting heavy, it's not a Chick Lit piece that would bore someone like my husband (in fact, he's reading it now). (And don't take my words to indicate that he's a chauvinist, because he's no such thing, and he loves strong female characters - just, living in a house of all women and girls, he sometimes feels that certain books or movies have ""too much estrogen for me right now"". This book definitely will not do that for him.) The writing is very engaging, so no yawning over Holt's work. Rise leaves me wanting to find recent books about the planets and their moons, and wanting to find out more from my father about his time working on the Space Shuttle programming. The only way this book could be better is if the title used ""Women"" instead of the diminuizing ""Girls,"" as these were all very much adults, and highly accomplished and respected ones at that.Oh yeah, and now I'm going to play the recordings from Voyager's gold record while I make some minestrone soup. . .

It jumps between detailed discussions of - if you will - rocket science, to low-level prose almost geared to a high school audience. It had the annoying habit of repeating how tired the women were while holding a demanding full-time job and trying to raise children. Mentioning it once or twice would have clinched the point.  The nomenclature of the time is interesting. These brilliant women who were at the cutting edge of rocket, military, and space technology going back to the late 30s and early 40s, were actually designated as "" computers."" This was obviously before that word had taken on strictly a mechanical, technological connotation.  The most striking parts of this account were the descriptions of the multiple failures as America was finding it footing in the increasingly intense competition with the Soviet Union in the Space Race. It is remarkable how many of the misfires were a product of pure carelessness; often with tragic effects. A topic with a great deal of potential but the themes did not get adequately developed and frequently got mangled in the delivery. A low 2 rating."

They were trailblazers as women in science and math. They broke social norms of being working mothers when only 20% of women with small children worked. They paved the way for my generation to have what we have today. Yes, they were paid less and weren't allowed (at first) to be engineers; but, they made it possible for the rest of us. Special shout-out to the women who discriminated against men and only hired women to act as ""computers"" at the Jet Propulsion Lab (JPL). I had serious PTSD flashbacks to Mrs. Semro's geometry and algebra II when the author talked about using carbon paper while making computations. Also, thank you, Suicide Squad, turned JPL, for hiring a bunch of women.Bottom-line, every young woman should read this book. Had I read this book when I was younger, I may not have fallen victim to the stereotype of women in STEM. Read, read, read."

It had been 3 weeks since I had left the book at a friend's house, so I had to slog through the entire book out of some sense of committment. I am going to have to re-think committment to books. I wanted to give this book 2☆. Maybe I am being generous. Maybe I am grateful for a little more technical I formation about rockets and outer space and beginning-estimate (that's a word :-s) history of automated computers and rockets and space travel. Maybe because it is unfair to rate this book with Hidden Figures: The American Dream and the Untold Story of the Black Women Mathematicians Who Helped Win the Space Race felt sluggish to me. That is in comparison. To compensate for my big social comparison, I give this book 3 ☆ when I wanted to give less."

I wish the book had gone into more depth - the writing style almost felt like it was aimed at very young readers and all the women were presented as basically the same person (pretty, liked numbers, joined JPL, married, had kids, left JPL, missed JPL, maybe came back) with no individual personality traits. Also, some women's stories were abruptly dropped at various points in the book, which was odd."

I am not a math/science person at all, but it was really cool to learn about the women ""computers"" whose handwritten formulas and calculations were the key to getting the US into the space race. I think any history buff would enjoy this one."

This time, unlike Hidden Figures, the action takes place on the West Coast. It could’ve been called the women of JPL. I feel like, as I continue to read more books about humanity’s odyssey beyond the earth, each one I read fills in more details. They are always compelling.This story focuses, of course on the female contribution to the space program, but it also tells much of the story of the work at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. This is not so much about sending astronauts into space but on the probes sent out to explore the planets, including the Voyagers and the Galileo and Cassini probes as well as the various missions to Mars and Venus. It’s a magnificent story.I love the fact that it also focuses to on the lives of the various women chronicled here. Personal lives are often left out of other histories, but they are huge part of the story. Just because you’re watching a greater history unfold doesn’t minimize what’s happening in your everyday life. This is a much more complete picture.I felt as though I got to know these women and like them as people. An intimate history. I highly recommend it."
153,0316338923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13239516-kara-of-bookishbytes,5,"The Rise of the Rocket Girls tells the story of a group of women who worked at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (or JPL) as human computers beginning in the 1940s. At that time, of course, computers--even calculators--were yet to be invented, so people had to do all mathematical calculations with pencil and paper. As rocket technology was being invented at JPL, all of the human calculators were women. They were smart, they were involved in the design and launch of spacecraft and their work was completely trusted by the male engineering staff. (Unfortunately, for decades, none of the women at JPL were given the title ""engineer"" even if their work was comparable to what the male engineers were doing. While most of the women highlighted in this book were never given a work title other than ""computer"", JPL did eventually recognize their indispensability and give them all of the human computers the title ""engineer"" regardless of their educational qualifications.)These women were also at the forefront of computer programming. As IBM developed electronic computers, the Rocket Girls trained in how to use them and there was a period of time (that appeared to last for many years) during which it seemed that the only computer programmers at JPL were women. I was surprised at the attitude that the author recounted of some of the male engineers who said they didn't trust the electronic computer's calculations--they wouldn't be confident until the women confirmed the results with pencil and paper. I almost can't imagine thinking a person could do math better than a computer. But that's how good these women were. (And also how uncertain people were of computer technology in its infancy.)Interwoven with the stories of rocket tests and trajectories are the personal stories of several of these remarkable women. They came from a range of backgrounds and it was wonderful to read about how different they all were--but how they all shared the drive to be excellent in their cutting edge work. Lots of girl power here, and no back-biting or malicious melodrama. I read a library copy of this book, but I've bought my own copy to have because I want my kids to all read this and I want to be able to pass it around to friends."
154,0316338923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3809399-stormin,4,"It's really hard not to compare this book directly with the (more famous) Hidden Figures: The American Dream and the Untold Story of the Black Women Mathematicians Who Helped Win the Space Race, and the conclusion is simple: Rise of the Rocket Girls is a better book.There are two main reasons for this. First, the book has a more concentrated narrative. Hidden Figures is all over the place, with long, long tangents that don't really go anywhere and no central narrative. It's more of an exhaustive index of things that happened in the lives of female, black computers than a story of any kind. By contrast, Rise of the Rocket Girls has much more accessible themes--like the desire of the female (white and black) computers to be a part of inventing rockets to explore space instead of just to deliver warheads and kill people.Second, the book had really great scientific explanations. I'm not a physicist or aerospace engineer or anything like that, but I do have a quantitative background with degrees in math, systems engineering, and economics. So I do know a thing or two about math, and so I can recognize a really good mathematical explanation when I see one. You know, the kind of explanation where the meaning is clear to anyone (regardless of their mathematical background) but the meaning is also faithful to the actual, technical concept being explained. That's really hard to do, and Nathalia Hold makes it look effortless. This make the book more fun to read, because you felt like you were getting a real feel for the kinds of scientific problems that these women were solving.I can easily imagine that the material in Hidden Figures made for a better movie (I haven't seen it yet), but as far as books go, this is the one I'd read if I had to pick just one."
155,0316338923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/55339687-linds,2,"Yuck.To me, it is nearly invaluable that someone took the initiative to track down the surviving JPL 'human computers' and get their stories. That's something that isn't on record anywhere, and that history, particularly various anecdotes they may have from that time period, is very intriguing.But, yeesh. The way it was put together and the items the author chose to highlight drove me insane. I gave it two stars only because there are, in fact, good bits of information to be found. I do have to applaud the author for getting these women together again. But most of it felt like such a waste of a golden opportunity.The author spends the majority of the book talking about whichever ""rocket girl"" is being focused on and her hair, her clothes, her boyfriend/husband, her children, her troubles at home, etc. I'm sure that plays a part, but I really would have liked that to take more of a backseat. The interesting info about JPL felt more like asterisks at the bottom of the page.I majored in engineering, and I've worked for NASA. I've been the only female in many situations. I support giving these ladies a spotlight. I just think this book is so busy hamming up their gender that it forgets to fully illuminate their accomplishments. The idea isn't to say, ""Look, we're girls!"" The idea is to say, ""Yeah. We're awesome.""(Another book released recently, The Glass Universe: How the Ladies of the Harvard Observatory Took the Measure of the Stars does a much better job of this, for anyone interested. Though I warn it hits the other extreme for any not really keen on the subject. It is quite information and background heavy.)"

However, I just could not finish this book. It read as if it were an outline of chronological events with a few verbs and adjectives thrown in there. There was not one character that I felt tied to enough to want to finish the book. The author jumped from person to person, not developing one single character. So many names were dropped that I could not keep track of who was who. This barrage of women was punctuated by an attempt to connect the reader to them by telling brief, campy quips of detailed information about dresses, beauty pageants, and personal relationships. By trying to cover so much, the author truly did these amazing women a disservice with her poor writing. Had she taken the time to tell one or two stories really well, the book would really be able to celebrate the work of all of these amazing women."
157,0316338923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32637832-anne,3,"The author had obviously done a lot of research, and I really liked that she was able to explain a lot of the STEM stuff so that even an anti-STEM person like me could understand it. But throughout the book, I felt that she was writing at a young adult level instead of an adult non-fiction level. I even checked the spine label to see if our library had designated the book in that way. I know a lot of adults like to read young adult books, but I am not one of them, so I found the tone simplistic and somewhat demeaning. I mean, seriously, I used to OPERATE a key punch machine. I know what one is. "
158,0316338923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7029980-katie-doing-dewey,4,"Review: This was a fun read and highlighted some important work, but I would have liked more depth on the technical side of the story.Long before 'computers' were calculating machines, they were mathematicians (primarily women) and eventually the first software developers. Working at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, an elite group of female computers fought hard to balance personal lives with careers they loved at a time when that was still considered a highly unusual thing for a woman to do. Through their expertise and painstaking effort, these computers ""transformed rocket design, helped bring about the first American satellites, and made the exploration of the solar system possible"" (source).I was initially a bit disappointed by this book. The first story, focused on Barby Canright, spent a lot of time talking about her clothes, her makeup, and her relationships. That wouldn't bother me, except there were also very few technical details of her work and a lot of the story focused on one of the men she worked with. Fortunately, it got better from there. All of the other women's stories also talked about their relationships, but this was balanced by information about the work they did. I suspect that the bad beginning at least partially reflected the fact that earlier women computers were primarily doing math to implement other people's ideas. They weren't allowed to serve as engineers and were probably not often able to suggest experiments.Occasionally, I did still feel that the author was stereotyping the women, (for instance, an older women was put in charge of the group not because of her experience, but because she was 'a  mother hen') but overall the stories got better towards the end. I did really like that the author just told the women's stories, without digressing into discussions of stereotypes and the barriers they faced. She let their stories speak for themselves. And they were great stories! Like in 
Hidden Figures
, the author followed many women over decades, so we could see how many different women chose to balance their careers and how things changed over time. Many of the women worked on incredibly important space exploration efforts. The missions that gave us our first images of other planets were particularly awe-inspiring. Overall, I had a lot of fun reading this book. I just would have liked some more technical details to round it out!This review was originally posted on Doing Dewey"
159,0316338923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1256262-ron,4,"“Engineers make up the problems and we solve them.” Helen LingDespite the cringe-worthy title, an excellent history of the women who contributed to the unique successes of Caltech’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). Superb concept and research. Too bad the storytelling falls short. With so large a cast, Holt often fails to identify her frequent shifts of focus character. Even as an advocacy work, her biases bleed through too obviously. “As odd as it seems by today’s standards, the beauty contest was a result of JPL’s progressive hiring practices … unintentionally highlight the presence of educated young women working for JPL.”Even with its shortcomings this sets the record straight about the vital contributions of the “computers” as they were called before the advent of massive and micro-computers of the last fifty years. “She didn’t feel intimidated. Instead she felt invisible.” “Many saw the shuttle as competition.” It certainly contested budget dollars, if not official and public attention. JPL continued to plan and execute successful scientific missions while most of NASA’s attention and money was wasted on grandstanding with people. (In my opinion, JPL’s Deep Space Network continues to do more science that the International Space Station.)“There was no doubt in her mind or anyone else’s that if they’d gone ahead with their design and put a satellite at the helm and fuel in that final stage, their creation would be circling the earth at this very moment.” (September 2, 1956)See also Hidden Figures, the story behind the contemporary black women climbing an even steeper hill at NASA Langley Research Center (Hampton, Virginia). Don’t understand why neither were nominated for Hugo Awards as related works.“Proper paranoia.” Gentry Lee JPL’s frequent failures highlight the risk when pushing the envelope of the possible. Those now planning to send people to Mars should reflect on the low success rate of unmanned missions to the red planet. “We’re a sisterhood.”"

It takes the reader all the way back to when Malina, Parsons, and a young group of men were doing their own experiments in the foothills, all the way to the 1980's. Now, if you're looking to learn more about women's contribution to this industry, I suggest you read Hidden Figures For a book that is supposed to be about what women accomplished at JPL, it really sings the praises of the men. All I got from this book was that women were computers. It didn't go into any details though. But boy, did it tell us exactly what the men did. Plus for a book about science, I don't understand why women's fashion was a point that needed to be brought up. Yes, there was a female revolution going on, but what exactly does wearing pants have to do with sending a rocket into space? The book says their colleagues didn't care. So why bring up this inane topic in the first place?And don't get me started on the lady that felt sympathetic for a Nazi war criminal. I get that he contributed a lot to science. But.... let's not forget the 6 million people that died!! Their lives are more important to me than shooting metal hunks of debris into space. In conclusion, read Hidden Figures instead!!!!! It's superbly well-written and details the contributions of a handful of women in the space industry."
161,0316338923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64510958-tayler-card,3,"The book The Rise of the Rocket Girls by Nathalia Holt was the stories of revolutionary women who helped pave the way in modern rocketry. The biography is a collection of stories of women who overcame adversities to pursue jobs, men typically had and women could normally not hold. These courageous women were know as computers. They were the mathematicians of the Jet Proportion Laboratory known as JPL. They came from around the United States and even other countries. They held positions of prestige, which had long hours, poor conditions, and many risks, where lives were on the line if you made a mistake. Despite the conditions, the laboratory was a tight group and had multiple outside events together. For the women, they found a second home, a place where they could thrive and not have to hide their brilliance.I personally enjoyed learning about the women's lives and there experiences, inside and out of JPL. The insight of the outside world and knowledge about history I found fascinating.I had a distaste for how much the book mentioned the mechanics instead of the people in the book. I also had an aversion for how quickly characters were introduced, abscond and mentioned much later in the book without any previous reference. I found the book quite intriguing, but a little bland. I did however enjoy the stories, especially the ironic ones. I found the writing style suitable for the content of the book, but it made it slightly difficult to follow. It doesn't really move the reader to activism, it makes you frustrated, but you feel that it's in the past. I think people who enjoy factual writing this book is for them."
162,0316338923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12860715-librarycin,3,"This book follows some of the human calculators who worked for NASA (and the precursor to NASA), starting in the 1940s up to and including the 21st century. It follows both their work and their home lives. Of course, at their work early on, it was mostly women who were the calculators, while men were the engineers. As women of the time, they were expected to leave when/if they got married, then pregnant.I listened to the audio and my interest came and went. What I paid attention to was interesting. As we got closer to current times, with my (for a while) interest in astronomy, it was fun to read about some of those space missions that I remember. Well, the first one I really remember wasn’t a “fun” one, Challenger in 1986, but some of the later ones were: Hubble Space Telescope, Spirit and Opportunity (sent to Mars to take photos and explore; intended on only lasting 1 year on the planet, but lasted 5 and 10 years instead!), and more. Oh, I also enjoyed the one little tidbit of info about Jupiter’s moon Io (which I named my current oldest cat after) – apparently it is filled with volcanoes. "
163,0316338923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4922340-kathy,3,"This book was a mixed bag for me. I was very interested in learning about these pioneering women and the men who supported them in their careers, and it didn’t disappoint on that front. I also learned A LOT about the space missions that I didn’t know. That being said, I got bogged down in the science at times and I was a scientist (albeit a geneticist, not a physicist or mathematician). I also found the story to jump around too much. I guess it was hard to tell all of these women’s stories without rehashing everything a million times but I kept getting lost. Maybe it is my corona brain. At the end of the day, I’m glad I read it but I was also counting down the pages for half the book, which isn’t exactly a glowing endorsement. "

167,0316338923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67951314-phrodrick,3,"Mine is a review of the large print edition, hard back of Nathalia Holt's Rise of the Rocket Girls. This is important because I found the large print edition particularly well bound, easy to read and easy to handle. It is rare that I notice anything about the binding of a book, but this edition does honor to the printer's art. The text however was less than it should have been. This is the history of the women who were the original computers at The Jet Propulsion Laboratory. As a former computer instructor, it always amazed me that most of my students had no clue that the word computer derives from the process of doing math, that people were employed as computers before there were machines to do the math, and that the machine is so named because what it does is math. What I did not know, until reading here is that hand done math had been the preferred method well into the space age. Ms. Holt makes it clear that by-hand calculations were just losing out to the machine about the time America was sending Apollo missions to the moon.What is now JPL began in the 1940’s as three collage age kids operating at great physical risk and minimal permission at Cal Tech. Being young and unsupervised they called themselves, The Suicide Squad. Their lack of safety procedures ultimately forced the school to push them out doors and away from campus. There they reformed as a business the JPL, The Jet Propulsion Laboratory.Their first income derived from their work for the US Army Air Corps developing the rocket engines used in JATO, Jet Assisted Take Off. These were basic jet engines strapped to propeller aircraft for the purpose of helping them launch quickly from short runways. The technique developed in WW II was still in use into the 1960's. Among the things that made JPL different was its willingness to employ women. In fact, the Computer department at JPL became a place where women, later including African American women could find professional level employment as advanced mathematicians. It is rarely appreciated that even in the 1940's and1950's women were able, if they were better than enough men to get advanced university training in mathematics. Most often the only work for them was as primary school teachers. However, there were places in various parts of the emerging world of what we now call High tech for women. It is now emerging that women had leading, if underappreciated roles in the development of Computers (the machines), and computer codes. Thanks to Ms Holt we know by name some of the women in the hard work of doing the math for the development of rocket engines.Returning to this book. I found Ms Holt writing to be vaguely under written. As if she was writing to a younger audience. Clearly, she was avoiding any detailed discussion of the math. Rather like describing how to make a complex menu item and avoiding all mention of the ingredients. Yes, math can be dull, but a better author can help you to share the frustrations and pleasure to be derived by the ability to handle complex math, under pressure and routinely produce reliable results. This is after all, rocket science. To most people this sounds dull. If your goal is to honor these women- and Ms. Holt wants us to honor them- and to inspire girls to follow, a few pages that detail the tedium and make clear the absolute demand for people up to this specialized set of challenges should have been better documented.What is best about the Rise of the Rocket Girls is that Ms. Holt sought out and interviewed the women who were the calculators. We see JPL progress from small military applications to the Apollo Launch pad. These women adapted to and took leadership roles in adapting the original desk calculators, capable of only a few mathematical processes replaced the slide rule. Later we get a worker’s point of view when the first generations of huge computers made hesitant, and cranky appearances before becoming the miracle machines we now barely think of - laptops, and smart phones and etc. These two generation of women learned how to program and master these machines. They are among the first rank of computer engineers. As exciting and inspirational as are the facts, Ms. Holt under serves them. She is given to name dropping. German, in fact ex Nazi Scientist Wernher von Braun, barely deserves his several mentions. Why she has to mention Carl Sagan is an open question. That there is a great deal about clothes, changing styles and the success or failure of their romantic lives may be part of telling “Her-Story” rather than “His-story”. A case can be made for mentions made the pants suits in the work place. But do we need the unrelated history of the invention of panty hose?The Rise of the Rocket Girls is an easy read. History for the casual, even the beach reader. But their work was anything but easy. Maybe asking more of the reader would have made this a better book. "
168,0316338923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4869474-jeane,4,"I really enjoyed this book for many reasons. First off, it was a great micro-history that focused on this historical women and the contributions to science and math and the entire space program, without them there would not have been one. Another reason I enjoyed this book is because my husband works at JPL and so many of the things they discuss in the book I am familiar with from his stories he comes home with. "
169,0316338923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3086584-shanon,5,I love this style of writing.

170,0316338923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14909704-ari-santillanes,4,"One of the main reasons I read is something called ""book fate."" I suppose I should expand the term to something like ""reading fate,"" but here's the general idea: I believe that I have been fated - predestined - to encounter certain reading material at exactly the right time in my life. I do not believe in coincidences.My latest encounter with book fate involves Nathalia Holt's book, Rise of the Rocket Girls: The Women Who Propelled Us, From Missles to the Moon to Mars. The writing style left something to be desired, but the content enthralled me. It is the story of the women who dedicated their lives - certainly their life's work - to the Jet Propulsion Lab (JPL) as computers and engineers from the 1940s to present. I don't read many histories, so how did this one find its way into my hands?My dad gave it to me. He confessed it was a title he hoped to read, but because it was at the end of a long queue, he thought maybe I could read it first. Right there, postponing his own date with the book enabled me to have it at the right moment! On the subject of dads, I started reading the book near Father's Day, and one of the unifying characteristics of many of the women is the early loss of their fathers. They recounted childhoods where their mothers, in a time when it certainly wasn't the norm, supported several children through pure determination and strong work ethic. Though not directly stated, I can infer that this produced a drive in the women of JPL to support themselves. Through realistic depictions of struggle (depression, divorce, raising children and families), Holt shows how many of the women are determined to maintain their independence through work. I feel deeply connected to the women in this respect. I've never considered being a stay-at-home mom, though I tremendously respect the work such mothers do. When I have children of my own, I anticipate that Mat and I will work hard to make our professional commitments manageable alongside our family priorities. That scares me, because professional and filial fulfillment are things that I value, things that often compete. I appreciated reading the stories of women who pioneered the concept of a ""working mom"" and remained intimidated by its implications. It was my goal to get this book returned/loaned to my dad before I left for Anaheim. It's a hardback and I didn't want to carry it with me on a plane. But failing to finish it and with so little to go, it was impossible to leave it behind. This is how fate works; it is not always convenient. Once I made it to Anaheim, all I could think about was its proximity to Pasadena. I stared to wonder: Does JPL offer tours? Would the women engineers working there be flattered or resentful if I geeked out and asked them, fangirlishly, to sign my book so that when I return it to my dad, it has some sacred weight to it? Am I really, in a town where celebrity sightings can happen anytime, fantasizing about meeting more down-to-earth people who just so happen to champion exploration among the stars?The final fated alignment was that Sue Finley's last project was about to culminate on July 4th, when Juno arrives at Jupiter. Though I learned this in the book's Epilogue, I first heard it from Mat when we were flying to Anaheim. As we were waiting to board the plane, literally minutes away, he stepped out of our boarding group to check one more newsstand for a ""good magazine."" He returned with a Scientific American which, in addition to containing many other compelling stories (we may have to subscribe) contained one detailing Juno's mission. Of all the magazines in all the world, he had to choose the one that added to my book! As I read over his shoulder, 30-40,000 feet in the air, I marveled at the constellation of connections between my reading material and my life. "

It isn't the story of getting a 'man' into space, like Hidden Figures and there is not 'civil rights' side to the story. This is the story of the smart women who worked in Pasadena at the Jet Propulsion Lab to build the rockets that would carry man to the moon and telescopes out to far away planets. It is also the story of the rise of the working woman who wanted a career and a family. These very bright women were gifted mathematicians and engineers in a time when girls weren't suppose to be good with numbers and most certainly not engineering. The author, Holt, focuses on a cluster of ladies who went to work at JPL just was WWII was winding down and stayed with the program until the turn of the century. The reader not only gets to know these precious ladies but gets a review of history from the rise of McCarthyism, to JFK's vision for our space program, to what we owe to it today. Women of a certain age will remember 'not being pregnant' at work and the debate over if 'we' could wear a pantsuit to work. For those who aren't up to keeping track of all the details about rocket propulsion, parts may be skimmed, but focus of these ladies and their wonderful friendships. The author does let you know what happened to each when their careers ended."

There is technical information that might be too much for the average reader and then, there were those who felt the author dealt too much with silly or sexist things about pageants and children or whatever made up these women's lives; (but isn’t that’s just it?), all the silly or sexist things made up the lives of our Rocket Girls. These women worked both outside the home in very demanding jobs and inside the home with husbands, children, family and society which is an all together different type of demanding yet extremely important job, and, at a time when women were considered an oddity if they worked apart from the home. I found this book captivating. There were moments when I wondered “why did the author put that there?” but then I realized those personal tidbits set apart from the highly technical and specialized positions spoken of were no less a part of these women and the times they were living in. This story tells about what the women went through to get to where we are today in engineering, space exploration, military weaponry and even our very own computer systems. These women adapted and struggled in order to make it in a man’s world but in my view and probably more important is the fact that each of these women enjoyed being women, and through it all were willing to sacrifice and strive for not only personal recognition and gain but also for the gain of future generations of women choosing to excel in mathematics and the sciences. This sisterhood remains strong in mutual respect and admiration because of their close knit working conditions and the friendships formed over time. Through the long hours endured and their strong, exacting work ethics they helped to achieve greatness and prosperity for our country first and foremost but also for a myriad of others who have taken what they started to the next levels.The author has written a fabulously warm-hearted and scientifically beautiful story of intelligent, witty and memorable first female engineers that deserves a top rank in your reading list. If you just couldn’t make it through the paper version I urge you to listen to the audiobook. Narrator Erin Bennett has provided a genuinely flawless production (well, there might have been a technical word or two she found difficult, but there’s not many who can say external disturbance-gravity gradient effect, magnetic-field torques, solar radiation and aerodynamic drag or radioisotope thermoelectric generator three times fast). Her voice was strong, easy to listen to and without excessive drama. Nathalia Holt brought the women to life but Erin Bennett took them off the page and let them live the past once again right before us.I hope you find this story as amazing and inspirational as I did.5 stars overall"

Hidden Figures: The American Dream and the Untold Story of the Black Women Mathematicians Who Helped Win the Space Race
, a book I desperately wanted to like because it is both so important and timely as well as the basis for an upcoming film which happens to look great ... but that other book, sadly, stumbled in several stylistic or organizational ways, which is not a problem here in Nathalia Holt's record of some different women who happened to be doing the same thing at the same time as their NASA counterparts as documented in Hidden Figures. But comparisons are doomed to fail; these books are attempting different things, and while Rise of the Rocket Girls doesn't pack the same punch in commentary on racism, it covers altogether different territory in its examination of the complex and ever-evolving relationship between motherhood (specifically) and work for these women computers. And it does so with clear organization, accessibility of language and thought, and a deft touch with the research. Complicated principles of orbital dynamics and so forth are woven in, yes, but always at the service of the narrative through-line, which tracks a slowly-changing group of women through the decades. Each section is organized around a handful of the larger group, and these women are highlighted gracefully and with care. The personal narrative voice breaks through occasionally, but not distractingly so. In short, stylistically, this is the book to read if you're looking for a primer on women computers in the space age; the content of other books like Hidden Figures may prove enlightening (and the jury's still out on the Junior edition of that book, which hasn't returned to my library yet) but they lack the energy and clarity of this book."

In telling us the story about the women of the Jet Propulsion Lab, Holt brings us a the bonus of another angle of the rise and development of the space exploration era. This one peers at the history from outside Cape Canaveral/Kennedy, and thus provides a fuller understanding of how widespread the industry has been - there is so much more than ""just"" NASA. This book will appeal to a broad spectrum - men and women, older and youthful. While containing trivial memoir-style annecdotes that infuse the more technical discussions with personal interest and keep the book from getting heavy, it's not a Chick Lit piece that would bore someone like my husband (in fact, he's reading it now). (And don't take my words to indicate that he's a chauvinist, because he's no such thing, and he loves strong female characters - just, living in a house of all women and girls, he sometimes feels that certain books or movies have ""too much estrogen for me right now"". This book definitely will not do that for him.) The writing is very engaging, so no yawning over Holt's work. Rise leaves me wanting to find recent books about the planets and their moons, and wanting to find out more from my father about his time working on the Space Shuttle programming. The only way this book could be better is if the title used ""Women"" instead of the diminuizing ""Girls,"" as these were all very much adults, and highly accomplished and respected ones at that.Oh yeah, and now I'm going to play the recordings from Voyager's gold record while I make some minestrone soup. . . Thank you, Nathalia Holt, for one of those reads that pull your mind into its zone long after you've turned the last page. :) "

It jumps between detailed discussions of - if you will - rocket science, to low-level prose almost geared to a high school audience. It had the annoying habit of repeating how tired the women were while holding a demanding full-time job and trying to raise children. Mentioning it once or twice would have clinched the point.  The nomenclature of the time is interesting. These brilliant women who were at the cutting edge of rocket, military, and space technology going back to the late 30s and early 40s, were actually designated as "" computers."" This was obviously before that word had taken on strictly a mechanical, technological connotation.  The most striking parts of this account were the descriptions of the multiple failures as America was finding it footing in the increasingly intense competition with the Soviet Union in the Space Race. It is remarkable how many of the misfires were a product of pure carelessness; often with tragic effects. A topic with a great deal of potential but the themes did not get adequately developed and frequently got mangled in the delivery. A low 2 rating."

Not only did I learn a lot about rocket and planetary science, but I felt like the women in this book, though we are separated by two generations, got me. They were trailblazers as women in science and math. They broke social norms of being working mothers when only 20% of women with small children worked. They paved the way for my generation to have what we have today. Yes, they were paid less and weren't allowed (at first) to be engineers; but, they made it possible for the rest of us. Special shout-out to the women who discriminated against men and only hired women to act as ""computers"" at the Jet Propulsion Lab (JPL). I had serious PTSD flashbacks to Mrs. Semro's geometry and algebra II when the author talked about using carbon paper while making computations. Also, thank you, Suicide Squad, turned JPL, for hiring a bunch of women.Bottom-line, every young woman should read this book. Had I read this book when I was younger, I may not have fallen victim to the stereotype of women in STEM. Read, read, read."

Also, some women's stories were abruptly dropped at various points in the book, which was odd."

This time, unlike Hidden Figures, the action takes place on the West Coast. It could’ve been called the women of JPL. I feel like, as I continue to read more books about humanity’s odyssey beyond the earth, each one I read fills in more details. They are always compelling.This story focuses, of course on the female contribution to the space program, but it also tells much of the story of the work at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. This is not so much about sending astronauts into space but on the probes sent out to explore the planets, including the Voyagers and the Galileo and Cassini probes as well as the various missions to Mars and Venus. It’s a magnificent story.I love the fact that it also focuses to on the lives of the various women chronicled here. Personal lives are often left out of other histories, but they are huge part of the story. Just because you’re watching a greater history unfold doesn’t minimize what’s happening in your everyday life. This is a much more complete picture.I felt as though I got to know these women and like them as people. An intimate history. I highly recommend it."
183,0316338923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13239516-kara-of-bookishbytes,5,"The Rise of the Rocket Girls tells the story of a group of women who worked at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (or JPL) as human computers beginning in the 1940s. At that time, of course, computers--even calculators--were yet to be invented, so people had to do all mathematical calculations with pencil and paper. As rocket technology was being invented at JPL, all of the human calculators were women. They were smart, they were involved in the design and launch of spacecraft and their work was completely trusted by the male engineering staff. (Unfortunately, for decades, none of the women at JPL were given the title ""engineer"" even if their work was comparable to what the male engineers were doing. While most of the women highlighted in this book were never given a work title other than ""computer"", JPL did eventually recognize their indispensability and give them all of the human computers the title ""engineer"" regardless of their educational qualifications.)These women were also at the forefront of computer programming. As IBM developed electronic computers, the Rocket Girls trained in how to use them and there was a period of time (that appeared to last for many years) during which it seemed that the only computer programmers at JPL were women. I was surprised at the attitude that the author recounted of some of the male engineers who said they didn't trust the electronic computer's calculations--they wouldn't be confident until the women confirmed the results with pencil and paper. I almost can't imagine thinking a person could do math better than a computer. But that's how good these women were. (And also how uncertain people were of computer technology in its infancy.)Interwoven with the stories of rocket tests and trajectories are the personal stories of several of these remarkable women. They came from a range of backgrounds and it was wonderful to read about how different they all were--but how they all shared the drive to be excellent in their cutting edge work. Lots of girl power here, and no back-biting or malicious melodrama. I read a library copy of this book, but I've bought my own copy to have because I want my kids to all read this and I want to be able to pass it around to friends."
184,0316338923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3809399-stormin,4,"It's really hard not to compare this book directly with the (more famous) Hidden Figures: The American Dream and the Untold Story of the Black Women Mathematicians Who Helped Win the Space Race, and the conclusion is simple: Rise of the Rocket Girls is a better book.There are two main reasons for this. First, the book has a more concentrated narrative. Hidden Figures is all over the place, with long, long tangents that don't really go anywhere and no central narrative. It's more of an exhaustive index of things that happened in the lives of female, black computers than a story of any kind. By contrast, Rise of the Rocket Girls has much more accessible themes--like the desire of the female (white and black) computers to be a part of inventing rockets to explore space instead of just to deliver warheads and kill people.Second, the book had really great scientific explanations. I'm not a physicist or aerospace engineer or anything like that, but I do have a quantitative background with degrees in math, systems engineering, and economics. So I do know a thing or two about math, and so I can recognize a really good mathematical explanation when I see one. You know, the kind of explanation where the meaning is clear to anyone (regardless of their mathematical background) but the meaning is also faithful to the actual, technical concept being explained. That's really hard to do, and Nathalia Hold makes it look effortless. This make the book more fun to read, because you felt like you were getting a real feel for the kinds of scientific problems that these women were solving.I can easily imagine that the material in Hidden Figures made for a better movie (I haven't seen it yet), but as far as books go, this is the one I'd read if I had to pick just one."
185,0316338923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/55339687-linds,2,"Yuck.To me, it is nearly invaluable that someone took the initiative to track down the surviving JPL 'human computers' and get their stories. That's something that isn't on record anywhere, and that history, particularly various anecdotes they may have from that time period, is very intriguing.But, yeesh. The way it was put together and the items the author chose to highlight drove me insane. I gave it two stars only because there are, in fact, good bits of information to be found. I do have to applaud the author for getting these women together again. But most of it felt like such a waste of a golden opportunity.The author spends the majority of the book talking about whichever ""rocket girl"" is being focused on and her hair, her clothes, her boyfriend/husband, her children, her troubles at home, etc. I'm sure that plays a part, but I really would have liked that to take more of a backseat. The interesting info about JPL felt more like asterisks at the bottom of the page.I majored in engineering, and I've worked for NASA. I've been the only female in many situations. I support giving these ladies a spotlight. I just think this book is so busy hamming up their gender that it forgets to fully illuminate their accomplishments. The idea isn't to say, ""Look, we're girls!"" The idea is to say, ""Yeah. We're awesome.""(Another book released recently, The Glass Universe: How the Ladies of the Harvard Observatory Took the Measure of the Stars does a much better job of this, for anyone interested. Though I warn it hits the other extreme for any not really keen on the subject. It is quite information and background heavy.)"

However, I just could not finish this book. It read as if it were an outline of chronological events with a few verbs and adjectives thrown in there. There was not one character that I felt tied to enough to want to finish the book. The author jumped from person to person, not developing one single character. So many names were dropped that I could not keep track of who was who. This barrage of women was punctuated by an attempt to connect the reader to them by telling brief, campy quips of detailed information about dresses, beauty pageants, and personal relationships. By trying to cover so much, the author truly did these amazing women a disservice with her poor writing. Had she taken the time to tell one or two stories really well, the book would really be able to celebrate the work of all of these amazing women."

But throughout the book, I felt that she was writing at a young adult level instead of an adult non-fiction level. I even checked the spine label to see if our library had designated the book in that way. I know a lot of adults like to read young adult books, but I am not one of them, so I found the tone simplistic and somewhat demeaning. I mean, seriously, I used to OPERATE a key punch machine.

188,0316338923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7029980-katie-doing-dewey,4,"Review: This was a fun read and highlighted some important work, but I would have liked more depth on the technical side of the story.Long before 'computers' were calculating machines, they were mathematicians (primarily women) and eventually the first software developers. Working at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, an elite group of female computers fought hard to balance personal lives with careers they loved at a time when that was still considered a highly unusual thing for a woman to do. Through their expertise and painstaking effort, these computers ""transformed rocket design, helped bring about the first American satellites, and made the exploration of the solar system possible"" (source).I was initially a bit disappointed by this book. The first story, focused on Barby Canright, spent a lot of time talking about her clothes, her makeup, and her relationships. That wouldn't bother me, except there were also very few technical details of her work and a lot of the story focused on one of the men she worked with. Fortunately, it got better from there. All of the other women's stories also talked about their relationships, but this was balanced by information about the work they did. I suspect that the bad beginning at least partially reflected the fact that earlier women computers were primarily doing math to implement other people's ideas. They weren't allowed to serve as engineers and were probably not often able to suggest experiments.Occasionally, I did still feel that the author was stereotyping the women, (for instance, an older women was put in charge of the group not because of her experience, but because she was 'a  mother hen') but overall the stories got better towards the end. I did really like that the author just told the women's stories, without digressing into discussions of stereotypes and the barriers they faced. She let their stories speak for themselves. And they were great stories! Like in 
Hidden Figures
, the author followed many women over decades, so we could see how many different women chose to balance their careers and how things changed over time. Many of the women worked on incredibly important space exploration efforts. The missions that gave us our first images of other planets were particularly awe-inspiring. Overall, I had a lot of fun reading this book. I just would have liked some more technical details to round it out!This review was originally posted on Doing Dewey"

Superb concept and research. Too bad the storytelling falls short. With so large a cast, Holt often fails to identify her frequent shifts of focus character. Even as an advocacy work, her biases bleed through too obviously. “As odd as it seems by today’s standards, the beauty contest was a result of JPL’s progressive hiring practices … unintentionally highlight the presence of educated young women working for JPL.”Even with its shortcomings this sets the record straight about the vital contributions of the “computers” as they were called before the advent of massive and micro-computers of the last fifty years. “She didn’t feel intimidated. Instead she felt invisible.” “Many saw the shuttle as competition.” It certainly contested budget dollars, if not official and public attention. JPL continued to plan and execute successful scientific missions while most of NASA’s attention and money was wasted on grandstanding with people. (In my opinion, JPL’s Deep Space Network continues to do more science that the International Space Station.)“There was no doubt in her mind or anyone else’s that if they’d gone ahead with their design and put a satellite at the helm and fuel in that final stage, their creation would be circling the earth at this very moment.” (September 2, 1956)See also Hidden Figures, the story behind the contemporary black women climbing an even steeper hill at NASA Langley Research Center (Hampton, Virginia). Don’t understand why neither were nominated for Hugo Awards as related works.“Proper paranoia.” Gentry Lee JPL’s frequent failures highlight the risk when pushing the envelope of the possible. Those now planning to send people to Mars should reflect on the low success rate of unmanned missions to the red planet. “We’re a sisterhood.”"

Now, if you're looking to learn more about women's contribution to this industry, I suggest you read Hidden Figures For a book that is supposed to be about what women accomplished at JPL, it really sings the praises of the men. All I got from this book was that women were computers. It didn't go into any details though. But boy, did it tell us exactly what the men did. Plus for a book about science, I don't understand why women's fashion was a point that needed to be brought up. Yes, there was a female revolution going on, but what exactly does wearing pants have to do with sending a rocket into space? The book says their colleagues didn't care. So why bring up this inane topic in the first place?And don't get me started on the lady that felt sympathetic for a Nazi war criminal. I get that he contributed a lot to science. But.... let's not forget the 6 million people that died!! Their lives are more important to me than shooting metal hunks of debris into space. In conclusion, read Hidden Figures instead!!!!!

The biography is a collection of stories of women who overcame adversities to pursue jobs, men typically had and women could normally not hold. These courageous women were know as computers. They were the mathematicians of the Jet Proportion Laboratory known as JPL. They came from around the United States and even other countries. They held positions of prestige, which had long hours, poor conditions, and many risks, where lives were on the line if you made a mistake. Despite the conditions, the laboratory was a tight group and had multiple outside events together. For the women, they found a second home, a place where they could thrive and not have to hide their brilliance.I personally enjoyed learning about the women's lives and there experiences, inside and out of JPL. The insight of the outside world and knowledge about history I found fascinating.I had a distaste for how much the book mentioned the mechanics instead of the people in the book. I also had an aversion for how quickly characters were introduced, abscond and mentioned much later in the book without any previous reference. I found the book quite intriguing, but a little bland. I did however enjoy the stories, especially the ironic ones. I found the writing style suitable for the content of the book, but it made it slightly difficult to follow. It doesn't really move the reader to activism, it makes you frustrated, but you feel that it's in the past. I think people who enjoy factual writing this book is for them."

It follows both their work and their home lives. Of course, at their work early on, it was mostly women who were the calculators, while men were the engineers. As women of the time, they were expected to leave when/if they got married, then pregnant.I listened to the audio and my interest came and went. What I paid attention to was interesting. As we got closer to current times, with my (for a while) interest in astronomy, it was fun to read about some of those space missions that I remember. Well, the first one I really remember wasn’t a “fun” one, Challenger in 1986, but some of the later ones were: Hubble Space Telescope, Spirit and Opportunity (sent to Mars to take photos and explore; intended on only lasting 1 year on the planet, but lasted 5 and 10 years instead!), and more.

I also learned A LOT about the space missions that I didn’t know. That being said, I got bogged down in the science at times and I was a scientist (albeit a geneticist, not a physicist or mathematician). I also found the story to jump around too much. I guess it was hard to tell all of these women’s stories without rehashing everything a million times but I kept getting lost. Maybe it is my corona brain.

197,0316338923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67951314-phrodrick,3,"Mine is a review of the large print edition, hard back of Nathalia Holt's Rise of the Rocket Girls. This is important because I found the large print edition particularly well bound, easy to read and easy to handle. It is rare that I notice anything about the binding of a book, but this edition does honor to the printer's art. The text however was less than it should have been. This is the history of the women who were the original computers at The Jet Propulsion Laboratory. As a former computer instructor, it always amazed me that most of my students had no clue that the word computer derives from the process of doing math, that people were employed as computers before there were machines to do the math, and that the machine is so named because what it does is math. What I did not know, until reading here is that hand done math had been the preferred method well into the space age. Ms. Holt makes it clear that by-hand calculations were just losing out to the machine about the time America was sending Apollo missions to the moon.What is now JPL began in the 1940’s as three collage age kids operating at great physical risk and minimal permission at Cal Tech. Being young and unsupervised they called themselves, The Suicide Squad. Their lack of safety procedures ultimately forced the school to push them out doors and away from campus. There they reformed as a business the JPL, The Jet Propulsion Laboratory.Their first income derived from their work for the US Army Air Corps developing the rocket engines used in JATO, Jet Assisted Take Off. These were basic jet engines strapped to propeller aircraft for the purpose of helping them launch quickly from short runways. The technique developed in WW II was still in use into the 1960's. Among the things that made JPL different was its willingness to employ women. In fact, the Computer department at JPL became a place where women, later including African American women could find professional level employment as advanced mathematicians. It is rarely appreciated that even in the 1940's and1950's women were able, if they were better than enough men to get advanced university training in mathematics. Most often the only work for them was as primary school teachers. However, there were places in various parts of the emerging world of what we now call High tech for women. It is now emerging that women had leading, if underappreciated roles in the development of Computers (the machines), and computer codes. Thanks to Ms Holt we know by name some of the women in the hard work of doing the math for the development of rocket engines.Returning to this book. I found Ms Holt writing to be vaguely under written. As if she was writing to a younger audience. Clearly, she was avoiding any detailed discussion of the math. Rather like describing how to make a complex menu item and avoiding all mention of the ingredients. Yes, math can be dull, but a better author can help you to share the frustrations and pleasure to be derived by the ability to handle complex math, under pressure and routinely produce reliable results. This is after all, rocket science. To most people this sounds dull. If your goal is to honor these women- and Ms. Holt wants us to honor them- and to inspire girls to follow, a few pages that detail the tedium and make clear the absolute demand for people up to this specialized set of challenges should have been better documented.What is best about the Rise of the Rocket Girls is that Ms. Holt sought out and interviewed the women who were the calculators. We see JPL progress from small military applications to the Apollo Launch pad. These women adapted to and took leadership roles in adapting the original desk calculators, capable of only a few mathematical processes replaced the slide rule. Later we get a worker’s point of view when the first generations of huge computers made hesitant, and cranky appearances before becoming the miracle machines we now barely think of - laptops, and smart phones and etc. These two generation of women learned how to program and master these machines. They are among the first rank of computer engineers. As exciting and inspirational as are the facts, Ms. Holt under serves them. She is given to name dropping. German, in fact ex Nazi Scientist Wernher von Braun, barely deserves his several mentions. Why she has to mention Carl Sagan is an open question. That there is a great deal about clothes, changing styles and the success or failure of their romantic lives may be part of telling “Her-Story” rather than “His-story”. A case can be made for mentions made the pants suits in the work place. But do we need the unrelated history of the invention of panty hose?The Rise of the Rocket Girls is an easy read. History for the casual, even the beach reader. But their work was anything but easy. Maybe asking more of the reader would have made this a better book. "

First off, it was a great micro-history that focused on this historical women and the contributions to science and math and the entire space program, without them there would not have been one. Another reason I enjoyed this book is because my husband works at JPL and so many of the things they discuss in the book I am familiar with from his stories he comes home with. "
199,0316338923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3086584-shanon,5,I love this style of writing. Getting to hear the amazing historical story of how space exploration came to be while also learning about the women who made it possible and the intimate details of their lives is wonderful. This is an excellent book and very well written. 
200,0316338923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14909704-ari-santillanes,4,"One of the main reasons I read is something called ""book fate."" I suppose I should expand the term to something like ""reading fate,"" but here's the general idea: I believe that I have been fated - predestined - to encounter certain reading material at exactly the right time in my life. I do not believe in coincidences.My latest encounter with book fate involves Nathalia Holt's book, Rise of the Rocket Girls: The Women Who Propelled Us, From Missles to the Moon to Mars. The writing style left something to be desired, but the content enthralled me. It is the story of the women who dedicated their lives - certainly their life's work - to the Jet Propulsion Lab (JPL) as computers and engineers from the 1940s to present. I don't read many histories, so how did this one find its way into my hands?My dad gave it to me. He confessed it was a title he hoped to read, but because it was at the end of a long queue, he thought maybe I could read it first. Right there, postponing his own date with the book enabled me to have it at the right moment! On the subject of dads, I started reading the book near Father's Day, and one of the unifying characteristics of many of the women is the early loss of their fathers. They recounted childhoods where their mothers, in a time when it certainly wasn't the norm, supported several children through pure determination and strong work ethic. Though not directly stated, I can infer that this produced a drive in the women of JPL to support themselves. Through realistic depictions of struggle (depression, divorce, raising children and families), Holt shows how many of the women are determined to maintain their independence through work. I feel deeply connected to the women in this respect. I've never considered being a stay-at-home mom, though I tremendously respect the work such mothers do. When I have children of my own, I anticipate that Mat and I will work hard to make our professional commitments manageable alongside our family priorities. That scares me, because professional and filial fulfillment are things that I value, things that often compete. I appreciated reading the stories of women who pioneered the concept of a ""working mom"" and remained intimidated by its implications. It was my goal to get this book returned/loaned to my dad before I left for Anaheim. It's a hardback and I didn't want to carry it with me on a plane. But failing to finish it and with so little to go, it was impossible to leave it behind. This is how fate works; it is not always convenient. Once I made it to Anaheim, all I could think about was its proximity to Pasadena. I stared to wonder: Does JPL offer tours? Would the women engineers working there be flattered or resentful if I geeked out and asked them, fangirlishly, to sign my book so that when I return it to my dad, it has some sacred weight to it? Am I really, in a town where celebrity sightings can happen anytime, fantasizing about meeting more down-to-earth people who just so happen to champion exploration among the stars?The final fated alignment was that Sue Finley's last project was about to culminate on July 4th, when Juno arrives at Jupiter. Though I learned this in the book's Epilogue, I first heard it from Mat when we were flying to Anaheim. As we were waiting to board the plane, literally minutes away, he stepped out of our boarding group to check one more newsstand for a ""good magazine."" He returned with a Scientific American which, in addition to containing many other compelling stories (we may have to subscribe) contained one detailing Juno's mission. Of all the magazines in all the world, he had to choose the one that added to my book! As I read over his shoulder, 30-40,000 feet in the air, I marveled at the constellation of connections between my reading material and my life. "
201,0316338923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6496760-allison,5,"Really fascinating book. It's a great pairing with ""Hidden Figures"". This book as a bonus gives a history how the term ""computer"" went from being a job description to a thing we all use. I loved learning about how involved the women at JPL were in all the missions."
202,0316338923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9055933-judy,4,"This was one of those books that I wouldn't have read if it hadn't been for my book club. I'm glad I did. It isn't the story of getting a 'man' into space, like Hidden Figures and there is not 'civil rights' side to the story. This is the story of the smart women who worked in Pasadena at the Jet Propulsion Lab to build the rockets that would carry man to the moon and telescopes out to far away planets. It is also the story of the rise of the working woman who wanted a career and a family. These very bright women were gifted mathematicians and engineers in a time when girls weren't suppose to be good with numbers and most certainly not engineering. The author, Holt, focuses on a cluster of ladies who went to work at JPL just was WWII was winding down and stayed with the program until the turn of the century. The reader not only gets to know these precious ladies but gets a review of history from the rise of McCarthyism, to JFK's vision for our space program, to what we owe to it today. Women of a certain age will remember 'not being pregnant' at work and the debate over if 'we' could wear a pantsuit to work. For those who aren't up to keeping track of all the details about rocket propulsion, parts may be skimmed, but focus of these ladies and their wonderful friendships. The author does let you know what happened to each when their careers ended."

There is technical information that might be too much for the average reader and then, there were those who felt the author dealt too much with silly or sexist things about pageants and children or whatever made up these women's lives; (but isn’t that’s just it?), all the silly or sexist things made up the lives of our Rocket Girls. These women worked both outside the home in very demanding jobs and inside the home with husbands, children, family and society which is an all together different type of demanding yet extremely important job, and, at a time when women were considered an oddity if they worked apart from the home. I found this book captivating. There were moments when I wondered “why did the author put that there?” but then I realized those personal tidbits set apart from the highly technical and specialized positions spoken of were no less a part of these women and the times they were living in. This story tells about what the women went through to get to where we are today in engineering, space exploration, military weaponry and even our very own computer systems. These women adapted and struggled in order to make it in a man’s world but in my view and probably more important is the fact that each of these women enjoyed being women, and through it all were willing to sacrifice and strive for not only personal recognition and gain but also for the gain of future generations of women choosing to excel in mathematics and the sciences. This sisterhood remains strong in mutual respect and admiration because of their close knit working conditions and the friendships formed over time. Through the long hours endured and their strong, exacting work ethics they helped to achieve greatness and prosperity for our country first and foremost but also for a myriad of others who have taken what they started to the next levels.The author has written a fabulously warm-hearted and scientifically beautiful story of intelligent, witty and memorable first female engineers that deserves a top rank in your reading list. If you just couldn’t make it through the paper version I urge you to listen to the audiobook. Narrator Erin Bennett has provided a genuinely flawless production (well, there might have been a technical word or two she found difficult, but there’s not many who can say external disturbance-gravity gradient effect, magnetic-field torques, solar radiation and aerodynamic drag or radioisotope thermoelectric generator three times fast). Her voice was strong, easy to listen to and without excessive drama. Nathalia Holt brought the women to life but Erin Bennett took them off the page and let them live the past once again right before us.I hope you find this story as amazing and inspirational as I did.5 stars overall"

Hidden Figures: The American Dream and the Untold Story of the Black Women Mathematicians Who Helped Win the Space Race
, a book I desperately wanted to like because it is both so important and timely as well as the basis for an upcoming film which happens to look great ... but that other book, sadly, stumbled in several stylistic or organizational ways, which is not a problem here in Nathalia Holt's record of some different women who happened to be doing the same thing at the same time as their NASA counterparts as documented in Hidden Figures. But comparisons are doomed to fail; these books are attempting different things, and while Rise of the Rocket Girls doesn't pack the same punch in commentary on racism, it covers altogether different territory in its examination of the complex and ever-evolving relationship between motherhood (specifically) and work for these women computers. And it does so with clear organization, accessibility of language and thought, and a deft touch with the research. Complicated principles of orbital dynamics and so forth are woven in, yes, but always at the service of the narrative through-line, which tracks a slowly-changing group of women through the decades. Each section is organized around a handful of the larger group, and these women are highlighted gracefully and with care. The personal narrative voice breaks through occasionally, but not distractingly so. In short, stylistically, this is the book to read if you're looking for a primer on women computers in the space age; the content of other books like Hidden Figures may prove enlightening (and the jury's still out on the Junior edition of that book, which hasn't returned to my library yet) but they lack the energy and clarity of this book."
206,0316338923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34366105-lynette-caulkins,5,"Wow! Fantastic non-fiction read! In telling us the story about the women of the Jet Propulsion Lab, Holt brings us a the bonus of another angle of the rise and development of the space exploration era. This one peers at the history from outside Cape Canaveral/Kennedy, and thus provides a fuller understanding of how widespread the industry has been - there is so much more than ""just"" NASA. This book will appeal to a broad spectrum - men and women, older and youthful. While containing trivial memoir-style annecdotes that infuse the more technical discussions with personal interest and keep the book from getting heavy, it's not a Chick Lit piece that would bore someone like my husband (in fact, he's reading it now). (And don't take my words to indicate that he's a chauvinist, because he's no such thing, and he loves strong female characters - just, living in a house of all women and girls, he sometimes feels that certain books or movies have ""too much estrogen for me right now"". This book definitely will not do that for him.) The writing is very engaging, so no yawning over Holt's work. Rise leaves me wanting to find recent books about the planets and their moons, and wanting to find out more from my father about his time working on the Space Shuttle programming. The only way this book could be better is if the title used ""Women"" instead of the diminuizing ""Girls,"" as these were all very much adults, and highly accomplished and respected ones at that.Oh yeah, and now I'm going to play the recordings from Voyager's gold record while I make some minestrone soup. . . Thank you, Nathalia Holt, for one of those reads that pull your mind into its zone long after you've turned the last page. :) "
207,0316338923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5005999-victor-harris,2," Very uneven and got lost in the narrative it was trying to tell. It jumps between detailed discussions of - if you will - rocket science, to low-level prose almost geared to a high school audience. It had the annoying habit of repeating how tired the women were while holding a demanding full-time job and trying to raise children. Mentioning it once or twice would have clinched the point.  The nomenclature of the time is interesting. These brilliant women who were at the cutting edge of rocket, military, and space technology going back to the late 30s and early 40s, were actually designated as "" computers."" This was obviously before that word had taken on strictly a mechanical, technological connotation.  The most striking parts of this account were the descriptions of the multiple failures as America was finding it footing in the increasingly intense competition with the Soviet Union in the Space Race. It is remarkable how many of the misfires were a product of pure carelessness; often with tragic effects. A topic with a great deal of potential but the themes did not get adequately developed and frequently got mangled in the delivery. A low 2 rating."
208,0316338923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4403212-amber,5,"Anyone who talked to me in any capacity in the week I listened to this book heard me sing its praises. Not only did I learn a lot about rocket and planetary science, but I felt like the women in this book, though we are separated by two generations, got me. They were trailblazers as women in science and math. They broke social norms of being working mothers when only 20% of women with small children worked. They paved the way for my generation to have what we have today. Yes, they were paid less and weren't allowed (at first) to be engineers; but, they made it possible for the rest of us. Special shout-out to the women who discriminated against men and only hired women to act as ""computers"" at the Jet Propulsion Lab (JPL). I had serious PTSD flashbacks to Mrs. Semro's geometry and algebra II when the author talked about using carbon paper while making computations. Also, thank you, Suicide Squad, turned JPL, for hiring a bunch of women.Bottom-line, every young woman should read this book. Had I read this book when I was younger, I may not have fallen victim to the stereotype of women in STEM. Read, read, read."

It had been 3 weeks since I had left the book at a friend's house, so I had to slog through the entire book out of some sense of committment. I am going to have to re-think committment to books. I wanted to give this book 2☆. Maybe I am being generous. Maybe I am grateful for a little more technical I formation about rockets and outer space and beginning-estimate (that's a word :-s) history of automated computers and rockets and space travel. Maybe because it is unfair to rate this book with Hidden Figures: The American Dream and the Untold Story of the Black Women Mathematicians Who Helped Win the Space Race felt sluggish to me.

I wish the book had gone into more depth - the writing style almost felt like it was aimed at very young readers and all the women were presented as basically the same person (pretty, liked numbers, joined JPL, married, had kids, left JPL, missed JPL, maybe came back) with no individual personality traits. Also, some women's stories were abruptly dropped at various points in the book, which was odd."

I am not a math/science person at all, but it was really cool to learn about the women ""computers"" whose handwritten formulas and calculations were the key to getting the US into the space race. I think any history buff would enjoy this one."

This time, unlike Hidden Figures, the action takes place on the West Coast. It could’ve been called the women of JPL. I feel like, as I continue to read more books about humanity’s odyssey beyond the earth, each one I read fills in more details. They are always compelling.This story focuses, of course on the female contribution to the space program, but it also tells much of the story of the work at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. This is not so much about sending astronauts into space but on the probes sent out to explore the planets, including the Voyagers and the Galileo and Cassini probes as well as the various missions to Mars and Venus. It’s a magnificent story.I love the fact that it also focuses to on the lives of the various women chronicled here. Personal lives are often left out of other histories, but they are huge part of the story. Just because you’re watching a greater history unfold doesn’t minimize what’s happening in your everyday life. This is a much more complete picture.I felt as though I got to know these women and like them as people. An intimate history. I highly recommend it."
213,0316338923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13239516-kara-of-bookishbytes,5,"The Rise of the Rocket Girls tells the story of a group of women who worked at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (or JPL) as human computers beginning in the 1940s. At that time, of course, computers--even calculators--were yet to be invented, so people had to do all mathematical calculations with pencil and paper. As rocket technology was being invented at JPL, all of the human calculators were women. They were smart, they were involved in the design and launch of spacecraft and their work was completely trusted by the male engineering staff. (Unfortunately, for decades, none of the women at JPL were given the title ""engineer"" even if their work was comparable to what the male engineers were doing. While most of the women highlighted in this book were never given a work title other than ""computer"", JPL did eventually recognize their indispensability and give them all of the human computers the title ""engineer"" regardless of their educational qualifications.)These women were also at the forefront of computer programming. As IBM developed electronic computers, the Rocket Girls trained in how to use them and there was a period of time (that appeared to last for many years) during which it seemed that the only computer programmers at JPL were women. I was surprised at the attitude that the author recounted of some of the male engineers who said they didn't trust the electronic computer's calculations--they wouldn't be confident until the women confirmed the results with pencil and paper. I almost can't imagine thinking a person could do math better than a computer. But that's how good these women were. (And also how uncertain people were of computer technology in its infancy.)Interwoven with the stories of rocket tests and trajectories are the personal stories of several of these remarkable women. They came from a range of backgrounds and it was wonderful to read about how different they all were--but how they all shared the drive to be excellent in their cutting edge work. Lots of girl power here, and no back-biting or malicious melodrama. I read a library copy of this book, but I've bought my own copy to have because I want my kids to all read this and I want to be able to pass it around to friends."
214,0316338923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3809399-stormin,4,"It's really hard not to compare this book directly with the (more famous) Hidden Figures: The American Dream and the Untold Story of the Black Women Mathematicians Who Helped Win the Space Race, and the conclusion is simple: Rise of the Rocket Girls is a better book.There are two main reasons for this. First, the book has a more concentrated narrative. Hidden Figures is all over the place, with long, long tangents that don't really go anywhere and no central narrative. It's more of an exhaustive index of things that happened in the lives of female, black computers than a story of any kind. By contrast, Rise of the Rocket Girls has much more accessible themes--like the desire of the female (white and black) computers to be a part of inventing rockets to explore space instead of just to deliver warheads and kill people.Second, the book had really great scientific explanations. I'm not a physicist or aerospace engineer or anything like that, but I do have a quantitative background with degrees in math, systems engineering, and economics. So I do know a thing or two about math, and so I can recognize a really good mathematical explanation when I see one. You know, the kind of explanation where the meaning is clear to anyone (regardless of their mathematical background) but the meaning is also faithful to the actual, technical concept being explained. That's really hard to do, and Nathalia Hold makes it look effortless. This make the book more fun to read, because you felt like you were getting a real feel for the kinds of scientific problems that these women were solving.I can easily imagine that the material in Hidden Figures made for a better movie (I haven't seen it yet), but as far as books go, this is the one I'd read if I had to pick just one."
215,0316338923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/55339687-linds,2,"Yuck.To me, it is nearly invaluable that someone took the initiative to track down the surviving JPL 'human computers' and get their stories. That's something that isn't on record anywhere, and that history, particularly various anecdotes they may have from that time period, is very intriguing.But, yeesh. The way it was put together and the items the author chose to highlight drove me insane. I gave it two stars only because there are, in fact, good bits of information to be found. I do have to applaud the author for getting these women together again. But most of it felt like such a waste of a golden opportunity.The author spends the majority of the book talking about whichever ""rocket girl"" is being focused on and her hair, her clothes, her boyfriend/husband, her children, her troubles at home, etc. I'm sure that plays a part, but I really would have liked that to take more of a backseat. The interesting info about JPL felt more like asterisks at the bottom of the page.I majored in engineering, and I've worked for NASA. I've been the only female in many situations. I support giving these ladies a spotlight. I just think this book is so busy hamming up their gender that it forgets to fully illuminate their accomplishments. The idea isn't to say, ""Look, we're girls!"" The idea is to say, ""Yeah. We're awesome.""(Another book released recently, The Glass Universe: How the Ladies of the Harvard Observatory Took the Measure of the Stars does a much better job of this, for anyone interested. Though I warn it hits the other extreme for any not really keen on the subject. It is quite information and background heavy.)"

However, I just could not finish this book. It read as if it were an outline of chronological events with a few verbs and adjectives thrown in there. There was not one character that I felt tied to enough to want to finish the book. The author jumped from person to person, not developing one single character. So many names were dropped that I could not keep track of who was who. This barrage of women was punctuated by an attempt to connect the reader to them by telling brief, campy quips of detailed information about dresses, beauty pageants, and personal relationships. By trying to cover so much, the author truly did these amazing women a disservice with her poor writing. Had she taken the time to tell one or two stories really well, the book would really be able to celebrate the work of all of these amazing women."

But throughout the book, I felt that she was writing at a young adult level instead of an adult non-fiction level. I even checked the spine label to see if our library had designated the book in that way. I know a lot of adults like to read young adult books, but I am not one of them, so I found the tone simplistic and somewhat demeaning. I mean, seriously, I used to OPERATE a key punch machine. I know what one is. "
218,0316338923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7029980-katie-doing-dewey,4,"Review: This was a fun read and highlighted some important work, but I would have liked more depth on the technical side of the story.Long before 'computers' were calculating machines, they were mathematicians (primarily women) and eventually the first software developers. Working at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, an elite group of female computers fought hard to balance personal lives with careers they loved at a time when that was still considered a highly unusual thing for a woman to do. Through their expertise and painstaking effort, these computers ""transformed rocket design, helped bring about the first American satellites, and made the exploration of the solar system possible"" (source).I was initially a bit disappointed by this book. The first story, focused on Barby Canright, spent a lot of time talking about her clothes, her makeup, and her relationships. That wouldn't bother me, except there were also very few technical details of her work and a lot of the story focused on one of the men she worked with. Fortunately, it got better from there. All of the other women's stories also talked about their relationships, but this was balanced by information about the work they did. I suspect that the bad beginning at least partially reflected the fact that earlier women computers were primarily doing math to implement other people's ideas. They weren't allowed to serve as engineers and were probably not often able to suggest experiments.Occasionally, I did still feel that the author was stereotyping the women, (for instance, an older women was put in charge of the group not because of her experience, but because she was 'a  mother hen') but overall the stories got better towards the end. I did really like that the author just told the women's stories, without digressing into discussions of stereotypes and the barriers they faced. She let their stories speak for themselves. And they were great stories! Like in 
Hidden Figures
, the author followed many women over decades, so we could see how many different women chose to balance their careers and how things changed over time. Many of the women worked on incredibly important space exploration efforts. The missions that gave us our first images of other planets were particularly awe-inspiring. Overall, I had a lot of fun reading this book. I just would have liked some more technical details to round it out!This review was originally posted on Doing Dewey"
219,0316338923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1256262-ron,4,"“Engineers make up the problems and we solve them.” Helen LingDespite the cringe-worthy title, an excellent history of the women who contributed to the unique successes of Caltech’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). Superb concept and research. Too bad the storytelling falls short. With so large a cast, Holt often fails to identify her frequent shifts of focus character. Even as an advocacy work, her biases bleed through too obviously. “As odd as it seems by today’s standards, the beauty contest was a result of JPL’s progressive hiring practices … unintentionally highlight the presence of educated young women working for JPL.”Even with its shortcomings this sets the record straight about the vital contributions of the “computers” as they were called before the advent of massive and micro-computers of the last fifty years. “She didn’t feel intimidated. Instead she felt invisible.” “Many saw the shuttle as competition.” It certainly contested budget dollars, if not official and public attention. JPL continued to plan and execute successful scientific missions while most of NASA’s attention and money was wasted on grandstanding with people. (In my opinion, JPL’s Deep Space Network continues to do more science that the International Space Station.)“There was no doubt in her mind or anyone else’s that if they’d gone ahead with their design and put a satellite at the helm and fuel in that final stage, their creation would be circling the earth at this very moment.” (September 2, 1956)See also Hidden Figures, the story behind the contemporary black women climbing an even steeper hill at NASA Langley Research Center (Hampton, Virginia). Don’t understand why neither were nominated for Hugo Awards as related works.“Proper paranoia.” Gentry Lee JPL’s frequent failures highlight the risk when pushing the envelope of the possible. Those now planning to send people to Mars should reflect on the low success rate of unmanned missions to the red planet. “We’re a sisterhood.”"

It takes the reader all the way back to when Malina, Parsons, and a young group of men were doing their own experiments in the foothills, all the way to the 1980's. Now, if you're looking to learn more about women's contribution to this industry, I suggest you read Hidden Figures For a book that is supposed to be about what women accomplished at JPL, it really sings the praises of the men. All I got from this book was that women were computers. It didn't go into any details though. But boy, did it tell us exactly what the men did. Plus for a book about science, I don't understand why women's fashion was a point that needed to be brought up. Yes, there was a female revolution going on, but what exactly does wearing pants have to do with sending a rocket into space? The book says their colleagues didn't care. So why bring up this inane topic in the first place?And don't get me started on the lady that felt sympathetic for a Nazi war criminal. I get that he contributed a lot to science. But.... let's not forget the 6 million people that died!! Their lives are more important to me than shooting metal hunks of debris into space. In conclusion, read Hidden Figures instead!!!!! It's superbly well-written and details the contributions of a handful of women in the space industry."
221,0316338923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64510958-tayler-card,3,"The book The Rise of the Rocket Girls by Nathalia Holt was the stories of revolutionary women who helped pave the way in modern rocketry. The biography is a collection of stories of women who overcame adversities to pursue jobs, men typically had and women could normally not hold. These courageous women were know as computers. They were the mathematicians of the Jet Proportion Laboratory known as JPL. They came from around the United States and even other countries. They held positions of prestige, which had long hours, poor conditions, and many risks, where lives were on the line if you made a mistake. Despite the conditions, the laboratory was a tight group and had multiple outside events together. For the women, they found a second home, a place where they could thrive and not have to hide their brilliance.I personally enjoyed learning about the women's lives and there experiences, inside and out of JPL. The insight of the outside world and knowledge about history I found fascinating.I had a distaste for how much the book mentioned the mechanics instead of the people in the book. I also had an aversion for how quickly characters were introduced, abscond and mentioned much later in the book without any previous reference. I found the book quite intriguing, but a little bland. I did however enjoy the stories, especially the ironic ones. I found the writing style suitable for the content of the book, but it made it slightly difficult to follow. It doesn't really move the reader to activism, it makes you frustrated, but you feel that it's in the past. I think people who enjoy factual writing this book is for them."
222,0316338923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12860715-librarycin,3,"This book follows some of the human calculators who worked for NASA (and the precursor to NASA), starting in the 1940s up to and including the 21st century. It follows both their work and their home lives. Of course, at their work early on, it was mostly women who were the calculators, while men were the engineers. As women of the time, they were expected to leave when/if they got married, then pregnant.I listened to the audio and my interest came and went. What I paid attention to was interesting. As we got closer to current times, with my (for a while) interest in astronomy, it was fun to read about some of those space missions that I remember. Well, the first one I really remember wasn’t a “fun” one, Challenger in 1986, but some of the later ones were: Hubble Space Telescope, Spirit and Opportunity (sent to Mars to take photos and explore; intended on only lasting 1 year on the planet, but lasted 5 and 10 years instead!), and more. Oh, I also enjoyed the one little tidbit of info about Jupiter’s moon Io (which I named my current oldest cat after) – apparently it is filled with volcanoes. "
223,0316338923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4922340-kathy,3,"This book was a mixed bag for me. I was very interested in learning about these pioneering women and the men who supported them in their careers, and it didn’t disappoint on that front. I also learned A LOT about the space missions that I didn’t know. That being said, I got bogged down in the science at times and I was a scientist (albeit a geneticist, not a physicist or mathematician). I also found the story to jump around too much. I guess it was hard to tell all of these women’s stories without rehashing everything a million times but I kept getting lost. Maybe it is my corona brain. At the end of the day, I’m glad I read it but I was also counting down the pages for half the book, which isn’t exactly a glowing endorsement. "

I am happy to have found this book: about space (and science and engineering) but also about world history, and gender and familial expectations. The writing about science managed the appropriate balance of accuracy and plain-language, clearly-communicated simplicity. Looking at my bookshelf of male authors telling history about men, I am thrilled to have this story about successful women in aerospace."

227,0316338923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67951314-phrodrick,3,"Mine is a review of the large print edition, hard back of Nathalia Holt's Rise of the Rocket Girls. This is important because I found the large print edition particularly well bound, easy to read and easy to handle. It is rare that I notice anything about the binding of a book, but this edition does honor to the printer's art. The text however was less than it should have been. This is the history of the women who were the original computers at The Jet Propulsion Laboratory. As a former computer instructor, it always amazed me that most of my students had no clue that the word computer derives from the process of doing math, that people were employed as computers before there were machines to do the math, and that the machine is so named because what it does is math. What I did not know, until reading here is that hand done math had been the preferred method well into the space age. Ms. Holt makes it clear that by-hand calculations were just losing out to the machine about the time America was sending Apollo missions to the moon.What is now JPL began in the 1940’s as three collage age kids operating at great physical risk and minimal permission at Cal Tech. Being young and unsupervised they called themselves, The Suicide Squad. Their lack of safety procedures ultimately forced the school to push them out doors and away from campus. There they reformed as a business the JPL, The Jet Propulsion Laboratory.Their first income derived from their work for the US Army Air Corps developing the rocket engines used in JATO, Jet Assisted Take Off. These were basic jet engines strapped to propeller aircraft for the purpose of helping them launch quickly from short runways. The technique developed in WW II was still in use into the 1960's. Among the things that made JPL different was its willingness to employ women. In fact, the Computer department at JPL became a place where women, later including African American women could find professional level employment as advanced mathematicians. It is rarely appreciated that even in the 1940's and1950's women were able, if they were better than enough men to get advanced university training in mathematics. Most often the only work for them was as primary school teachers. However, there were places in various parts of the emerging world of what we now call High tech for women. It is now emerging that women had leading, if underappreciated roles in the development of Computers (the machines), and computer codes. Thanks to Ms Holt we know by name some of the women in the hard work of doing the math for the development of rocket engines.Returning to this book. I found Ms Holt writing to be vaguely under written. As if she was writing to a younger audience. Clearly, she was avoiding any detailed discussion of the math. Rather like describing how to make a complex menu item and avoiding all mention of the ingredients. Yes, math can be dull, but a better author can help you to share the frustrations and pleasure to be derived by the ability to handle complex math, under pressure and routinely produce reliable results. This is after all, rocket science. To most people this sounds dull. If your goal is to honor these women- and Ms. Holt wants us to honor them- and to inspire girls to follow, a few pages that detail the tedium and make clear the absolute demand for people up to this specialized set of challenges should have been better documented.What is best about the Rise of the Rocket Girls is that Ms. Holt sought out and interviewed the women who were the calculators. We see JPL progress from small military applications to the Apollo Launch pad. These women adapted to and took leadership roles in adapting the original desk calculators, capable of only a few mathematical processes replaced the slide rule. Later we get a worker’s point of view when the first generations of huge computers made hesitant, and cranky appearances before becoming the miracle machines we now barely think of - laptops, and smart phones and etc. These two generation of women learned how to program and master these machines. They are among the first rank of computer engineers. As exciting and inspirational as are the facts, Ms. Holt under serves them. She is given to name dropping. German, in fact ex Nazi Scientist Wernher von Braun, barely deserves his several mentions. Why she has to mention Carl Sagan is an open question. That there is a great deal about clothes, changing styles and the success or failure of their romantic lives may be part of telling “Her-Story” rather than “His-story”. A case can be made for mentions made the pants suits in the work place. But do we need the unrelated history of the invention of panty hose?The Rise of the Rocket Girls is an easy read. History for the casual, even the beach reader. But their work was anything but easy. Maybe asking more of the reader would have made this a better book. "
228,0316338923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4869474-jeane,4,"I really enjoyed this book for many reasons. First off, it was a great micro-history that focused on this historical women and the contributions to science and math and the entire space program, without them there would not have been one. Another reason I enjoyed this book is because my husband works at JPL and so many of the things they discuss in the book I am familiar with from his stories he comes home with. "
229,0316338923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3086584-shanon,5,I love this style of writing. Getting to hear the amazing historical story of how space exploration came to be while also learning about the women who made it possible and the intimate details of their lives is wonderful. This is an excellent book and very well written. 
230,0316338923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14909704-ari-santillanes,4,"One of the main reasons I read is something called ""book fate."" I suppose I should expand the term to something like ""reading fate,"" but here's the general idea: I believe that I have been fated - predestined - to encounter certain reading material at exactly the right time in my life. I do not believe in coincidences.My latest encounter with book fate involves Nathalia Holt's book, Rise of the Rocket Girls: The Women Who Propelled Us, From Missles to the Moon to Mars. The writing style left something to be desired, but the content enthralled me. It is the story of the women who dedicated their lives - certainly their life's work - to the Jet Propulsion Lab (JPL) as computers and engineers from the 1940s to present. I don't read many histories, so how did this one find its way into my hands?My dad gave it to me. He confessed it was a title he hoped to read, but because it was at the end of a long queue, he thought maybe I could read it first. Right there, postponing his own date with the book enabled me to have it at the right moment! On the subject of dads, I started reading the book near Father's Day, and one of the unifying characteristics of many of the women is the early loss of their fathers. They recounted childhoods where their mothers, in a time when it certainly wasn't the norm, supported several children through pure determination and strong work ethic. Though not directly stated, I can infer that this produced a drive in the women of JPL to support themselves. Through realistic depictions of struggle (depression, divorce, raising children and families), Holt shows how many of the women are determined to maintain their independence through work. I feel deeply connected to the women in this respect. I've never considered being a stay-at-home mom, though I tremendously respect the work such mothers do. When I have children of my own, I anticipate that Mat and I will work hard to make our professional commitments manageable alongside our family priorities. That scares me, because professional and filial fulfillment are things that I value, things that often compete. I appreciated reading the stories of women who pioneered the concept of a ""working mom"" and remained intimidated by its implications. It was my goal to get this book returned/loaned to my dad before I left for Anaheim. It's a hardback and I didn't want to carry it with me on a plane. But failing to finish it and with so little to go, it was impossible to leave it behind. This is how fate works; it is not always convenient. Once I made it to Anaheim, all I could think about was its proximity to Pasadena. I stared to wonder: Does JPL offer tours? Would the women engineers working there be flattered or resentful if I geeked out and asked them, fangirlishly, to sign my book so that when I return it to my dad, it has some sacred weight to it? Am I really, in a town where celebrity sightings can happen anytime, fantasizing about meeting more down-to-earth people who just so happen to champion exploration among the stars?The final fated alignment was that Sue Finley's last project was about to culminate on July 4th, when Juno arrives at Jupiter. Though I learned this in the book's Epilogue, I first heard it from Mat when we were flying to Anaheim. As we were waiting to board the plane, literally minutes away, he stepped out of our boarding group to check one more newsstand for a ""good magazine."" He returned with a Scientific American which, in addition to containing many other compelling stories (we may have to subscribe) contained one detailing Juno's mission. Of all the magazines in all the world, he had to choose the one that added to my book! As I read over his shoulder, 30-40,000 feet in the air, I marveled at the constellation of connections between my reading material and my life. "
231,0316338923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6496760-allison,5,"Really fascinating book. It's a great pairing with ""Hidden Figures"". This book as a bonus gives a history how the term ""computer"" went from being a job description to a thing we all use. I loved learning about how involved the women at JPL were in all the missions."
232,0316338923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9055933-judy,4,"This was one of those books that I wouldn't have read if it hadn't been for my book club. I'm glad I did. It isn't the story of getting a 'man' into space, like Hidden Figures and there is not 'civil rights' side to the story. This is the story of the smart women who worked in Pasadena at the Jet Propulsion Lab to build the rockets that would carry man to the moon and telescopes out to far away planets. It is also the story of the rise of the working woman who wanted a career and a family. These very bright women were gifted mathematicians and engineers in a time when girls weren't suppose to be good with numbers and most certainly not engineering. The author, Holt, focuses on a cluster of ladies who went to work at JPL just was WWII was winding down and stayed with the program until the turn of the century. The reader not only gets to know these precious ladies but gets a review of history from the rise of McCarthyism, to JFK's vision for our space program, to what we owe to it today. Women of a certain age will remember 'not being pregnant' at work and the debate over if 'we' could wear a pantsuit to work. For those who aren't up to keeping track of all the details about rocket propulsion, parts may be skimmed, but focus of these ladies and their wonderful friendships. The author does let you know what happened to each when their careers ended."

There is technical information that might be too much for the average reader and then, there were those who felt the author dealt too much with silly or sexist things about pageants and children or whatever made up these women's lives; (but isn’t that’s just it?), all the silly or sexist things made up the lives of our Rocket Girls. These women worked both outside the home in very demanding jobs and inside the home with husbands, children, family and society which is an all together different type of demanding yet extremely important job, and, at a time when women were considered an oddity if they worked apart from the home. I found this book captivating. There were moments when I wondered “why did the author put that there?” but then I realized those personal tidbits set apart from the highly technical and specialized positions spoken of were no less a part of these women and the times they were living in. This story tells about what the women went through to get to where we are today in engineering, space exploration, military weaponry and even our very own computer systems. These women adapted and struggled in order to make it in a man’s world but in my view and probably more important is the fact that each of these women enjoyed being women, and through it all were willing to sacrifice and strive for not only personal recognition and gain but also for the gain of future generations of women choosing to excel in mathematics and the sciences. This sisterhood remains strong in mutual respect and admiration because of their close knit working conditions and the friendships formed over time. Through the long hours endured and their strong, exacting work ethics they helped to achieve greatness and prosperity for our country first and foremost but also for a myriad of others who have taken what they started to the next levels.The author has written a fabulously warm-hearted and scientifically beautiful story of intelligent, witty and memorable first female engineers that deserves a top rank in your reading list. If you just couldn’t make it through the paper version I urge you to listen to the audiobook. Narrator Erin Bennett has provided a genuinely flawless production (well, there might have been a technical word or two she found difficult, but there’s not many who can say external disturbance-gravity gradient effect, magnetic-field torques, solar radiation and aerodynamic drag or radioisotope thermoelectric generator three times fast). Her voice was strong, easy to listen to and without excessive drama. Nathalia Holt brought the women to life but Erin Bennett took them off the page and let them live the past once again right before us.I hope you find this story as amazing and inspirational as I did.5 stars overall"

Hidden Figures: The American Dream and the Untold Story of the Black Women Mathematicians Who Helped Win the Space Race
, a book I desperately wanted to like because it is both so important and timely as well as the basis for an upcoming film which happens to look great ... but that other book, sadly, stumbled in several stylistic or organizational ways, which is not a problem here in Nathalia Holt's record of some different women who happened to be doing the same thing at the same time as their NASA counterparts as documented in Hidden Figures. But comparisons are doomed to fail; these books are attempting different things, and while Rise of the Rocket Girls doesn't pack the same punch in commentary on racism, it covers altogether different territory in its examination of the complex and ever-evolving relationship between motherhood (specifically) and work for these women computers. And it does so with clear organization, accessibility of language and thought, and a deft touch with the research. Complicated principles of orbital dynamics and so forth are woven in, yes, but always at the service of the narrative through-line, which tracks a slowly-changing group of women through the decades. Each section is organized around a handful of the larger group, and these women are highlighted gracefully and with care. The personal narrative voice breaks through occasionally, but not distractingly so. In short, stylistically, this is the book to read if you're looking for a primer on women computers in the space age; the content of other books like Hidden Figures may prove enlightening (and the jury's still out on the Junior edition of that book, which hasn't returned to my library yet) but they lack the energy and clarity of this book."
236,0316338923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34366105-lynette-caulkins,5,"Wow! Fantastic non-fiction read! In telling us the story about the women of the Jet Propulsion Lab, Holt brings us a the bonus of another angle of the rise and development of the space exploration era. This one peers at the history from outside Cape Canaveral/Kennedy, and thus provides a fuller understanding of how widespread the industry has been - there is so much more than ""just"" NASA. This book will appeal to a broad spectrum - men and women, older and youthful. While containing trivial memoir-style annecdotes that infuse the more technical discussions with personal interest and keep the book from getting heavy, it's not a Chick Lit piece that would bore someone like my husband (in fact, he's reading it now). (And don't take my words to indicate that he's a chauvinist, because he's no such thing, and he loves strong female characters - just, living in a house of all women and girls, he sometimes feels that certain books or movies have ""too much estrogen for me right now"". This book definitely will not do that for him.) The writing is very engaging, so no yawning over Holt's work. Rise leaves me wanting to find recent books about the planets and their moons, and wanting to find out more from my father about his time working on the Space Shuttle programming. The only way this book could be better is if the title used ""Women"" instead of the diminuizing ""Girls,"" as these were all very much adults, and highly accomplished and respected ones at that.Oh yeah, and now I'm going to play the recordings from Voyager's gold record while I make some minestrone soup. . . Thank you, Nathalia Holt, for one of those reads that pull your mind into its zone long after you've turned the last page. :) "
237,0316338923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5005999-victor-harris,2," Very uneven and got lost in the narrative it was trying to tell. It jumps between detailed discussions of - if you will - rocket science, to low-level prose almost geared to a high school audience. It had the annoying habit of repeating how tired the women were while holding a demanding full-time job and trying to raise children. Mentioning it once or twice would have clinched the point.  The nomenclature of the time is interesting. These brilliant women who were at the cutting edge of rocket, military, and space technology going back to the late 30s and early 40s, were actually designated as "" computers."" This was obviously before that word had taken on strictly a mechanical, technological connotation.  The most striking parts of this account were the descriptions of the multiple failures as America was finding it footing in the increasingly intense competition with the Soviet Union in the Space Race. It is remarkable how many of the misfires were a product of pure carelessness; often with tragic effects. A topic with a great deal of potential but the themes did not get adequately developed and frequently got mangled in the delivery. A low 2 rating."
238,0316338923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4403212-amber,5,"Anyone who talked to me in any capacity in the week I listened to this book heard me sing its praises. Not only did I learn a lot about rocket and planetary science, but I felt like the women in this book, though we are separated by two generations, got me. They were trailblazers as women in science and math. They broke social norms of being working mothers when only 20% of women with small children worked. They paved the way for my generation to have what we have today. Yes, they were paid less and weren't allowed (at first) to be engineers; but, they made it possible for the rest of us. Special shout-out to the women who discriminated against men and only hired women to act as ""computers"" at the Jet Propulsion Lab (JPL). I had serious PTSD flashbacks to Mrs. Semro's geometry and algebra II when the author talked about using carbon paper while making computations. Also, thank you, Suicide Squad, turned JPL, for hiring a bunch of women.Bottom-line, every young woman should read this book.

I wish the book had gone into more depth - the writing style almost felt like it was aimed at very young readers and all the women were presented as basically the same person (pretty, liked numbers, joined JPL, married, had kids, left JPL, missed JPL, maybe came back) with no individual personality traits. Also, some women's stories were abruptly dropped at various points in the book, which was odd."

I think any history buff would enjoy this one."

This time, unlike Hidden Figures, the action takes place on the West Coast. It could’ve been called the women of JPL. I feel like, as I continue to read more books about humanity’s odyssey beyond the earth, each one I read fills in more details. They are always compelling.This story focuses, of course on the female contribution to the space program, but it also tells much of the story of the work at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. This is not so much about sending astronauts into space but on the probes sent out to explore the planets, including the Voyagers and the Galileo and Cassini probes as well as the various missions to Mars and Venus. It’s a magnificent story.I love the fact that it also focuses to on the lives of the various women chronicled here. Personal lives are often left out of other histories, but they are huge part of the story. Just because you’re watching a greater history unfold doesn’t minimize what’s happening in your everyday life. This is a much more complete picture.I felt as though I got to know these women and like them as people. An intimate history. I highly recommend it."
243,0316338923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13239516-kara-of-bookishbytes,5,"The Rise of the Rocket Girls tells the story of a group of women who worked at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (or JPL) as human computers beginning in the 1940s. At that time, of course, computers--even calculators--were yet to be invented, so people had to do all mathematical calculations with pencil and paper. As rocket technology was being invented at JPL, all of the human calculators were women. They were smart, they were involved in the design and launch of spacecraft and their work was completely trusted by the male engineering staff. (Unfortunately, for decades, none of the women at JPL were given the title ""engineer"" even if their work was comparable to what the male engineers were doing. While most of the women highlighted in this book were never given a work title other than ""computer"", JPL did eventually recognize their indispensability and give them all of the human computers the title ""engineer"" regardless of their educational qualifications.)These women were also at the forefront of computer programming. As IBM developed electronic computers, the Rocket Girls trained in how to use them and there was a period of time (that appeared to last for many years) during which it seemed that the only computer programmers at JPL were women. I was surprised at the attitude that the author recounted of some of the male engineers who said they didn't trust the electronic computer's calculations--they wouldn't be confident until the women confirmed the results with pencil and paper. I almost can't imagine thinking a person could do math better than a computer. But that's how good these women were. (And also how uncertain people were of computer technology in its infancy.)Interwoven with the stories of rocket tests and trajectories are the personal stories of several of these remarkable women. They came from a range of backgrounds and it was wonderful to read about how different they all were--but how they all shared the drive to be excellent in their cutting edge work. Lots of girl power here, and no back-biting or malicious melodrama. I read a library copy of this book, but I've bought my own copy to have because I want my kids to all read this and I want to be able to pass it around to friends."
244,0316338923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3809399-stormin,4,"It's really hard not to compare this book directly with the (more famous) Hidden Figures: The American Dream and the Untold Story of the Black Women Mathematicians Who Helped Win the Space Race, and the conclusion is simple: Rise of the Rocket Girls is a better book.There are two main reasons for this. First, the book has a more concentrated narrative. Hidden Figures is all over the place, with long, long tangents that don't really go anywhere and no central narrative. It's more of an exhaustive index of things that happened in the lives of female, black computers than a story of any kind. By contrast, Rise of the Rocket Girls has much more accessible themes--like the desire of the female (white and black) computers to be a part of inventing rockets to explore space instead of just to deliver warheads and kill people.Second, the book had really great scientific explanations. I'm not a physicist or aerospace engineer or anything like that, but I do have a quantitative background with degrees in math, systems engineering, and economics. So I do know a thing or two about math, and so I can recognize a really good mathematical explanation when I see one. You know, the kind of explanation where the meaning is clear to anyone (regardless of their mathematical background) but the meaning is also faithful to the actual, technical concept being explained. That's really hard to do, and Nathalia Hold makes it look effortless. This make the book more fun to read, because you felt like you were getting a real feel for the kinds of scientific problems that these women were solving.I can easily imagine that the material in Hidden Figures made for a better movie (I haven't seen it yet), but as far as books go, this is the one I'd read if I had to pick just one."
245,0316338923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/55339687-linds,2,"Yuck.To me, it is nearly invaluable that someone took the initiative to track down the surviving JPL 'human computers' and get their stories. That's something that isn't on record anywhere, and that history, particularly various anecdotes they may have from that time period, is very intriguing.But, yeesh. The way it was put together and the items the author chose to highlight drove me insane. I gave it two stars only because there are, in fact, good bits of information to be found. I do have to applaud the author for getting these women together again. But most of it felt like such a waste of a golden opportunity.The author spends the majority of the book talking about whichever ""rocket girl"" is being focused on and her hair, her clothes, her boyfriend/husband, her children, her troubles at home, etc. I'm sure that plays a part, but I really would have liked that to take more of a backseat. The interesting info about JPL felt more like asterisks at the bottom of the page.I majored in engineering, and I've worked for NASA. I've been the only female in many situations. I support giving these ladies a spotlight. I just think this book is so busy hamming up their gender that it forgets to fully illuminate their accomplishments. The idea isn't to say, ""Look, we're girls!"" The idea is to say, ""Yeah. We're awesome.""(Another book released recently, The Glass Universe: How the Ladies of the Harvard Observatory Took the Measure of the Stars does a much better job of this, for anyone interested. Though I warn it hits the other extreme for any not really keen on the subject. It is quite information and background heavy.)"

However, I just could not finish this book. It read as if it were an outline of chronological events with a few verbs and adjectives thrown in there. There was not one character that I felt tied to enough to want to finish the book. The author jumped from person to person, not developing one single character. So many names were dropped that I could not keep track of who was who. This barrage of women was punctuated by an attempt to connect the reader to them by telling brief, campy quips of detailed information about dresses, beauty pageants, and personal relationships. By trying to cover so much, the author truly did these amazing women a disservice with her poor writing. Had she taken the time to tell one or two stories really well, the book would really be able to celebrate the work of all of these amazing women."
247,0316338923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32637832-anne,3,"The author had obviously done a lot of research, and I really liked that she was able to explain a lot of the STEM stuff so that even an anti-STEM person like me could understand it. But throughout the book, I felt that she was writing at a young adult level instead of an adult non-fiction level. I even checked the spine label to see if our library had designated the book in that way. I know a lot of adults like to read young adult books, but I am not one of them, so I found the tone simplistic and somewhat demeaning. I mean, seriously, I used to OPERATE a key punch machine. I know what one is. "
248,0316338923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7029980-katie-doing-dewey,4,"Review: This was a fun read and highlighted some important work, but I would have liked more depth on the technical side of the story.Long before 'computers' were calculating machines, they were mathematicians (primarily women) and eventually the first software developers. Working at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, an elite group of female computers fought hard to balance personal lives with careers they loved at a time when that was still considered a highly unusual thing for a woman to do. Through their expertise and painstaking effort, these computers ""transformed rocket design, helped bring about the first American satellites, and made the exploration of the solar system possible"" (source).I was initially a bit disappointed by this book. The first story, focused on Barby Canright, spent a lot of time talking about her clothes, her makeup, and her relationships. That wouldn't bother me, except there were also very few technical details of her work and a lot of the story focused on one of the men she worked with. Fortunately, it got better from there. All of the other women's stories also talked about their relationships, but this was balanced by information about the work they did. I suspect that the bad beginning at least partially reflected the fact that earlier women computers were primarily doing math to implement other people's ideas. They weren't allowed to serve as engineers and were probably not often able to suggest experiments.Occasionally, I did still feel that the author was stereotyping the women, (for instance, an older women was put in charge of the group not because of her experience, but because she was 'a  mother hen') but overall the stories got better towards the end. I did really like that the author just told the women's stories, without digressing into discussions of stereotypes and the barriers they faced. She let their stories speak for themselves. And they were great stories! Like in 
Hidden Figures
, the author followed many women over decades, so we could see how many different women chose to balance their careers and how things changed over time. Many of the women worked on incredibly important space exploration efforts. The missions that gave us our first images of other planets were particularly awe-inspiring. Overall, I had a lot of fun reading this book. I just would have liked some more technical details to round it out!This review was originally posted on Doing Dewey"
249,0316338923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1256262-ron,4,"“Engineers make up the problems and we solve them.” Helen LingDespite the cringe-worthy title, an excellent history of the women who contributed to the unique successes of Caltech’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). Superb concept and research. Too bad the storytelling falls short. With so large a cast, Holt often fails to identify her frequent shifts of focus character. Even as an advocacy work, her biases bleed through too obviously. “As odd as it seems by today’s standards, the beauty contest was a result of JPL’s progressive hiring practices … unintentionally highlight the presence of educated young women working for JPL.”Even with its shortcomings this sets the record straight about the vital contributions of the “computers” as they were called before the advent of massive and micro-computers of the last fifty years. “She didn’t feel intimidated. Instead she felt invisible.” “Many saw the shuttle as competition.” It certainly contested budget dollars, if not official and public attention. JPL continued to plan and execute successful scientific missions while most of NASA’s attention and money was wasted on grandstanding with people. (In my opinion, JPL’s Deep Space Network continues to do more science that the International Space Station.)“There was no doubt in her mind or anyone else’s that if they’d gone ahead with their design and put a satellite at the helm and fuel in that final stage, their creation would be circling the earth at this very moment.” (September 2, 1956)See also Hidden Figures, the story behind the contemporary black women climbing an even steeper hill at NASA Langley Research Center (Hampton, Virginia). Don’t understand why neither were nominated for Hugo Awards as related works.“Proper paranoia.” Gentry Lee JPL’s frequent failures highlight the risk when pushing the envelope of the possible. Those now planning to send people to Mars should reflect on the low success rate of unmanned missions to the red planet. “We’re a sisterhood.”"
250,0316338923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76584552-suziey,3,"If you want a complete history of the Jet Propulsion Lab in La Cañada (every true Angeleno knows it's not actually in Pasadena) then this is the book for you! It takes the reader all the way back to when Malina, Parsons, and a young group of men were doing their own experiments in the foothills, all the way to the 1980's. Now, if you're looking to learn more about women's contribution to this industry, I suggest you read Hidden Figures For a book that is supposed to be about what women accomplished at JPL, it really sings the praises of the men. All I got from this book was that women were computers. It didn't go into any details though. But boy, did it tell us exactly what the men did. Plus for a book about science, I don't understand why women's fashion was a point that needed to be brought up. Yes, there was a female revolution going on, but what exactly does wearing pants have to do with sending a rocket into space? The book says their colleagues didn't care. So why bring up this inane topic in the first place?And don't get me started on the lady that felt sympathetic for a Nazi war criminal. I get that he contributed a lot to science. But.... let's not forget the 6 million people that died!! Their lives are more important to me than shooting metal hunks of debris into space. In conclusion, read Hidden Figures instead!!!!! It's superbly well-written and details the contributions of a handful of women in the space industry."
251,0316338923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64510958-tayler-card,3,"The book The Rise of the Rocket Girls by Nathalia Holt was the stories of revolutionary women who helped pave the way in modern rocketry. The biography is a collection of stories of women who overcame adversities to pursue jobs, men typically had and women could normally not hold. These courageous women were know as computers. They were the mathematicians of the Jet Proportion Laboratory known as JPL. They came from around the United States and even other countries. They held positions of prestige, which had long hours, poor conditions, and many risks, where lives were on the line if you made a mistake. Despite the conditions, the laboratory was a tight group and had multiple outside events together. For the women, they found a second home, a place where they could thrive and not have to hide their brilliance.I personally enjoyed learning about the women's lives and there experiences, inside and out of JPL. The insight of the outside world and knowledge about history I found fascinating.I had a distaste for how much the book mentioned the mechanics instead of the people in the book. I also had an aversion for how quickly characters were introduced, abscond and mentioned much later in the book without any previous reference. I found the book quite intriguing, but a little bland. I did however enjoy the stories, especially the ironic ones. I found the writing style suitable for the content of the book, but it made it slightly difficult to follow. It doesn't really move the reader to activism, it makes you frustrated, but you feel that it's in the past. I think people who enjoy factual writing this book is for them."
252,0316338923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12860715-librarycin,3,"This book follows some of the human calculators who worked for NASA (and the precursor to NASA), starting in the 1940s up to and including the 21st century. It follows both their work and their home lives. Of course, at their work early on, it was mostly women who were the calculators, while men were the engineers. As women of the time, they were expected to leave when/if they got married, then pregnant.I listened to the audio and my interest came and went. What I paid attention to was interesting. As we got closer to current times, with my (for a while) interest in astronomy, it was fun to read about some of those space missions that I remember. Well, the first one I really remember wasn’t a “fun” one, Challenger in 1986, but some of the later ones were: Hubble Space Telescope, Spirit and Opportunity (sent to Mars to take photos and explore; intended on only lasting 1 year on the planet, but lasted 5 and 10 years instead!), and more. Oh, I also enjoyed the one little tidbit of info about Jupiter’s moon Io (which I named my current oldest cat after) – apparently it is filled with volcanoes. "
253,0316338923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4922340-kathy,3,"This book was a mixed bag for me. I was very interested in learning about these pioneering women and the men who supported them in their careers, and it didn’t disappoint on that front. I also learned A LOT about the space missions that I didn’t know. That being said, I got bogged down in the science at times and I was a scientist (albeit a geneticist, not a physicist or mathematician). I also found the story to jump around too much. I guess it was hard to tell all of these women’s stories without rehashing everything a million times but I kept getting lost. Maybe it is my corona brain. At the end of the day, I’m glad I read it but I was also counting down the pages for half the book, which isn’t exactly a glowing endorsement. "

The writing about science managed the appropriate balance of accuracy and plain-language, clearly-communicated simplicity. Looking at my bookshelf of male authors telling history about men, I am thrilled to have this story about successful women in aerospace."

257,0316338923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67951314-phrodrick,3,"Mine is a review of the large print edition, hard back of Nathalia Holt's Rise of the Rocket Girls. This is important because I found the large print edition particularly well bound, easy to read and easy to handle. It is rare that I notice anything about the binding of a book, but this edition does honor to the printer's art. The text however was less than it should have been. This is the history of the women who were the original computers at The Jet Propulsion Laboratory. As a former computer instructor, it always amazed me that most of my students had no clue that the word computer derives from the process of doing math, that people were employed as computers before there were machines to do the math, and that the machine is so named because what it does is math. What I did not know, until reading here is that hand done math had been the preferred method well into the space age. Ms. Holt makes it clear that by-hand calculations were just losing out to the machine about the time America was sending Apollo missions to the moon.What is now JPL began in the 1940’s as three collage age kids operating at great physical risk and minimal permission at Cal Tech. Being young and unsupervised they called themselves, The Suicide Squad. Their lack of safety procedures ultimately forced the school to push them out doors and away from campus. There they reformed as a business the JPL, The Jet Propulsion Laboratory.Their first income derived from their work for the US Army Air Corps developing the rocket engines used in JATO, Jet Assisted Take Off. These were basic jet engines strapped to propeller aircraft for the purpose of helping them launch quickly from short runways. The technique developed in WW II was still in use into the 1960's. Among the things that made JPL different was its willingness to employ women. In fact, the Computer department at JPL became a place where women, later including African American women could find professional level employment as advanced mathematicians. It is rarely appreciated that even in the 1940's and1950's women were able, if they were better than enough men to get advanced university training in mathematics. Most often the only work for them was as primary school teachers. However, there were places in various parts of the emerging world of what we now call High tech for women. It is now emerging that women had leading, if underappreciated roles in the development of Computers (the machines), and computer codes. Thanks to Ms Holt we know by name some of the women in the hard work of doing the math for the development of rocket engines.Returning to this book. I found Ms Holt writing to be vaguely under written. As if she was writing to a younger audience. Clearly, she was avoiding any detailed discussion of the math. Rather like describing how to make a complex menu item and avoiding all mention of the ingredients. Yes, math can be dull, but a better author can help you to share the frustrations and pleasure to be derived by the ability to handle complex math, under pressure and routinely produce reliable results. This is after all, rocket science. To most people this sounds dull. If your goal is to honor these women- and Ms. Holt wants us to honor them- and to inspire girls to follow, a few pages that detail the tedium and make clear the absolute demand for people up to this specialized set of challenges should have been better documented.What is best about the Rise of the Rocket Girls is that Ms. Holt sought out and interviewed the women who were the calculators. We see JPL progress from small military applications to the Apollo Launch pad. These women adapted to and took leadership roles in adapting the original desk calculators, capable of only a few mathematical processes replaced the slide rule. Later we get a worker’s point of view when the first generations of huge computers made hesitant, and cranky appearances before becoming the miracle machines we now barely think of - laptops, and smart phones and etc. These two generation of women learned how to program and master these machines. They are among the first rank of computer engineers. As exciting and inspirational as are the facts, Ms. Holt under serves them. She is given to name dropping. German, in fact ex Nazi Scientist Wernher von Braun, barely deserves his several mentions. Why she has to mention Carl Sagan is an open question. That there is a great deal about clothes, changing styles and the success or failure of their romantic lives may be part of telling “Her-Story” rather than “His-story”. A case can be made for mentions made the pants suits in the work place. But do we need the unrelated history of the invention of panty hose?The Rise of the Rocket Girls is an easy read. History for the casual, even the beach reader. But their work was anything but easy. Maybe asking more of the reader would have made this a better book. "
258,0316338923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4869474-jeane,4,"I really enjoyed this book for many reasons. First off, it was a great micro-history that focused on this historical women and the contributions to science and math and the entire space program, without them there would not have been one. Another reason I enjoyed this book is because my husband works at JPL and so many of the things they discuss in the book I am familiar with from his stories he comes home with. "
259,0316338923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3086584-shanon,5,I love this style of writing. Getting to hear the amazing historical story of how space exploration came to be while also learning about the women who made it possible and the intimate details of their lives is wonderful. This is an excellent book and very well written. 
260,0316338923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14909704-ari-santillanes,4,"One of the main reasons I read is something called ""book fate."" I suppose I should expand the term to something like ""reading fate,"" but here's the general idea: I believe that I have been fated - predestined - to encounter certain reading material at exactly the right time in my life. I do not believe in coincidences.My latest encounter with book fate involves Nathalia Holt's book, Rise of the Rocket Girls: The Women Who Propelled Us, From Missles to the Moon to Mars. The writing style left something to be desired, but the content enthralled me. It is the story of the women who dedicated their lives - certainly their life's work - to the Jet Propulsion Lab (JPL) as computers and engineers from the 1940s to present. I don't read many histories, so how did this one find its way into my hands?My dad gave it to me. He confessed it was a title he hoped to read, but because it was at the end of a long queue, he thought maybe I could read it first. Right there, postponing his own date with the book enabled me to have it at the right moment! On the subject of dads, I started reading the book near Father's Day, and one of the unifying characteristics of many of the women is the early loss of their fathers. They recounted childhoods where their mothers, in a time when it certainly wasn't the norm, supported several children through pure determination and strong work ethic. Though not directly stated, I can infer that this produced a drive in the women of JPL to support themselves. Through realistic depictions of struggle (depression, divorce, raising children and families), Holt shows how many of the women are determined to maintain their independence through work. I feel deeply connected to the women in this respect. I've never considered being a stay-at-home mom, though I tremendously respect the work such mothers do. When I have children of my own, I anticipate that Mat and I will work hard to make our professional commitments manageable alongside our family priorities. That scares me, because professional and filial fulfillment are things that I value, things that often compete. I appreciated reading the stories of women who pioneered the concept of a ""working mom"" and remained intimidated by its implications. It was my goal to get this book returned/loaned to my dad before I left for Anaheim. It's a hardback and I didn't want to carry it with me on a plane. But failing to finish it and with so little to go, it was impossible to leave it behind. This is how fate works; it is not always convenient. Once I made it to Anaheim, all I could think about was its proximity to Pasadena. I stared to wonder: Does JPL offer tours? Would the women engineers working there be flattered or resentful if I geeked out and asked them, fangirlishly, to sign my book so that when I return it to my dad, it has some sacred weight to it? Am I really, in a town where celebrity sightings can happen anytime, fantasizing about meeting more down-to-earth people who just so happen to champion exploration among the stars?The final fated alignment was that Sue Finley's last project was about to culminate on July 4th, when Juno arrives at Jupiter. Though I learned this in the book's Epilogue, I first heard it from Mat when we were flying to Anaheim. As we were waiting to board the plane, literally minutes away, he stepped out of our boarding group to check one more newsstand for a ""good magazine."" He returned with a Scientific American which, in addition to containing many other compelling stories (we may have to subscribe) contained one detailing Juno's mission. Of all the magazines in all the world, he had to choose the one that added to my book! As I read over his shoulder, 30-40,000 feet in the air, I marveled at the constellation of connections between my reading material and my life. "

262,0316338923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9055933-judy,4,"This was one of those books that I wouldn't have read if it hadn't been for my book club. I'm glad I did. It isn't the story of getting a 'man' into space, like Hidden Figures and there is not 'civil rights' side to the story. This is the story of the smart women who worked in Pasadena at the Jet Propulsion Lab to build the rockets that would carry man to the moon and telescopes out to far away planets. It is also the story of the rise of the working woman who wanted a career and a family. These very bright women were gifted mathematicians and engineers in a time when girls weren't suppose to be good with numbers and most certainly not engineering. The author, Holt, focuses on a cluster of ladies who went to work at JPL just was WWII was winding down and stayed with the program until the turn of the century. The reader not only gets to know these precious ladies but gets a review of history from the rise of McCarthyism, to JFK's vision for our space program, to what we owe to it today. Women of a certain age will remember 'not being pregnant' at work and the debate over if 'we' could wear a pantsuit to work. For those who aren't up to keeping track of all the details about rocket propulsion, parts may be skimmed, but focus of these ladies and their wonderful friendships. The author does let you know what happened to each when their careers ended."

There is technical information that might be too much for the average reader and then, there were those who felt the author dealt too much with silly or sexist things about pageants and children or whatever made up these women's lives; (but isn’t that’s just it?), all the silly or sexist things made up the lives of our Rocket Girls. These women worked both outside the home in very demanding jobs and inside the home with husbands, children, family and society which is an all together different type of demanding yet extremely important job, and, at a time when women were considered an oddity if they worked apart from the home. I found this book captivating. There were moments when I wondered “why did the author put that there?” but then I realized those personal tidbits set apart from the highly technical and specialized positions spoken of were no less a part of these women and the times they were living in. This story tells about what the women went through to get to where we are today in engineering, space exploration, military weaponry and even our very own computer systems. These women adapted and struggled in order to make it in a man’s world but in my view and probably more important is the fact that each of these women enjoyed being women, and through it all were willing to sacrifice and strive for not only personal recognition and gain but also for the gain of future generations of women choosing to excel in mathematics and the sciences. This sisterhood remains strong in mutual respect and admiration because of their close knit working conditions and the friendships formed over time. Through the long hours endured and their strong, exacting work ethics they helped to achieve greatness and prosperity for our country first and foremost but also for a myriad of others who have taken what they started to the next levels.The author has written a fabulously warm-hearted and scientifically beautiful story of intelligent, witty and memorable first female engineers that deserves a top rank in your reading list. If you just couldn’t make it through the paper version I urge you to listen to the audiobook. Narrator Erin Bennett has provided a genuinely flawless production (well, there might have been a technical word or two she found difficult, but there’s not many who can say external disturbance-gravity gradient effect, magnetic-field torques, solar radiation and aerodynamic drag or radioisotope thermoelectric generator three times fast). Her voice was strong, easy to listen to and without excessive drama. Nathalia Holt brought the women to life but Erin Bennett took them off the page and let them live the past once again right before us.I hope you find this story as amazing and inspirational as I did.5 stars overall"

Hidden Figures: The American Dream and the Untold Story of the Black Women Mathematicians Who Helped Win the Space Race
, a book I desperately wanted to like because it is both so important and timely as well as the basis for an upcoming film which happens to look great ... but that other book, sadly, stumbled in several stylistic or organizational ways, which is not a problem here in Nathalia Holt's record of some different women who happened to be doing the same thing at the same time as their NASA counterparts as documented in Hidden Figures. But comparisons are doomed to fail; these books are attempting different things, and while Rise of the Rocket Girls doesn't pack the same punch in commentary on racism, it covers altogether different territory in its examination of the complex and ever-evolving relationship between motherhood (specifically) and work for these women computers. And it does so with clear organization, accessibility of language and thought, and a deft touch with the research. Complicated principles of orbital dynamics and so forth are woven in, yes, but always at the service of the narrative through-line, which tracks a slowly-changing group of women through the decades. Each section is organized around a handful of the larger group, and these women are highlighted gracefully and with care. The personal narrative voice breaks through occasionally, but not distractingly so. In short, stylistically, this is the book to read if you're looking for a primer on women computers in the space age; the content of other books like Hidden Figures may prove enlightening (and the jury's still out on the Junior edition of that book, which hasn't returned to my library yet) but they lack the energy and clarity of this book."
266,0316338923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34366105-lynette-caulkins,5,"Wow! Fantastic non-fiction read! In telling us the story about the women of the Jet Propulsion Lab, Holt brings us a the bonus of another angle of the rise and development of the space exploration era. This one peers at the history from outside Cape Canaveral/Kennedy, and thus provides a fuller understanding of how widespread the industry has been - there is so much more than ""just"" NASA. This book will appeal to a broad spectrum - men and women, older and youthful. While containing trivial memoir-style annecdotes that infuse the more technical discussions with personal interest and keep the book from getting heavy, it's not a Chick Lit piece that would bore someone like my husband (in fact, he's reading it now). (And don't take my words to indicate that he's a chauvinist, because he's no such thing, and he loves strong female characters - just, living in a house of all women and girls, he sometimes feels that certain books or movies have ""too much estrogen for me right now"". This book definitely will not do that for him.) The writing is very engaging, so no yawning over Holt's work. Rise leaves me wanting to find recent books about the planets and their moons, and wanting to find out more from my father about his time working on the Space Shuttle programming. The only way this book could be better is if the title used ""Women"" instead of the diminuizing ""Girls,"" as these were all very much adults, and highly accomplished and respected ones at that.Oh yeah, and now I'm going to play the recordings from Voyager's gold record while I make some minestrone soup. . .

It had the annoying habit of repeating how tired the women were while holding a demanding full-time job and trying to raise children. Mentioning it once or twice would have clinched the point.  The nomenclature of the time is interesting. These brilliant women who were at the cutting edge of rocket, military, and space technology going back to the late 30s and early 40s, were actually designated as "" computers."" This was obviously before that word had taken on strictly a mechanical, technological connotation.  The most striking parts of this account were the descriptions of the multiple failures as America was finding it footing in the increasingly intense competition with the Soviet Union in the Space Race. It is remarkable how many of the misfires were a product of pure carelessness; often with tragic effects. A topic with a great deal of potential but the themes did not get adequately developed and frequently got mangled in the delivery. A low 2 rating."

Not only did I learn a lot about rocket and planetary science, but I felt like the women in this book, though we are separated by two generations, got me. They were trailblazers as women in science and math. They broke social norms of being working mothers when only 20% of women with small children worked. They paved the way for my generation to have what we have today. Yes, they were paid less and weren't allowed (at first) to be engineers; but, they made it possible for the rest of us. Special shout-out to the women who discriminated against men and only hired women to act as ""computers"" at the Jet Propulsion Lab (JPL). I had serious PTSD flashbacks to Mrs. Semro's geometry and algebra II when the author talked about using carbon paper while making computations. Also, thank you, Suicide Squad, turned JPL, for hiring a bunch of women.Bottom-line, every young woman should read this book. Had I read this book when I was younger, I may not have fallen victim to the stereotype of women in STEM. Read, read, read."

It had been 3 weeks since I had left the book at a friend's house, so I had to slog through the entire book out of some sense of committment. I am going to have to re-think committment to books. I wanted to give this book 2☆. Maybe I am being generous. Maybe I am grateful for a little more technical I formation about rockets and outer space and beginning-estimate (that's a word :-s) history of automated computers and rockets and space travel. Maybe because it is unfair to rate this book with Hidden Figures: The American Dream and the Untold Story of the Black Women Mathematicians Who Helped Win the Space Race felt sluggish to me.

I wish the book had gone into more depth - the writing style almost felt like it was aimed at very young readers and all the women were presented as basically the same person (pretty, liked numbers, joined JPL, married, had kids, left JPL, missed JPL, maybe came back) with no individual personality traits. Also, some women's stories were abruptly dropped at various points in the book, which was odd."

I am not a math/science person at all, but it was really cool to learn about the women ""computers"" whose handwritten formulas and calculations were the key to getting the US into the space race. I think any history buff would enjoy this one."

This time, unlike Hidden Figures, the action takes place on the West Coast. It could’ve been called the women of JPL. I feel like, as I continue to read more books about humanity’s odyssey beyond the earth, each one I read fills in more details. They are always compelling.This story focuses, of course on the female contribution to the space program, but it also tells much of the story of the work at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. This is not so much about sending astronauts into space but on the probes sent out to explore the planets, including the Voyagers and the Galileo and Cassini probes as well as the various missions to Mars and Venus. It’s a magnificent story.I love the fact that it also focuses to on the lives of the various women chronicled here. Personal lives are often left out of other histories, but they are huge part of the story. Just because you’re watching a greater history unfold doesn’t minimize what’s happening in your everyday life. This is a much more complete picture.I felt as though I got to know these women and like them as people. An intimate history. I highly recommend it."
273,0316338923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13239516-kara-of-bookishbytes,5,"The Rise of the Rocket Girls tells the story of a group of women who worked at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (or JPL) as human computers beginning in the 1940s. At that time, of course, computers--even calculators--were yet to be invented, so people had to do all mathematical calculations with pencil and paper. As rocket technology was being invented at JPL, all of the human calculators were women. They were smart, they were involved in the design and launch of spacecraft and their work was completely trusted by the male engineering staff. (Unfortunately, for decades, none of the women at JPL were given the title ""engineer"" even if their work was comparable to what the male engineers were doing. While most of the women highlighted in this book were never given a work title other than ""computer"", JPL did eventually recognize their indispensability and give them all of the human computers the title ""engineer"" regardless of their educational qualifications.)These women were also at the forefront of computer programming. As IBM developed electronic computers, the Rocket Girls trained in how to use them and there was a period of time (that appeared to last for many years) during which it seemed that the only computer programmers at JPL were women. I was surprised at the attitude that the author recounted of some of the male engineers who said they didn't trust the electronic computer's calculations--they wouldn't be confident until the women confirmed the results with pencil and paper. I almost can't imagine thinking a person could do math better than a computer. But that's how good these women were. (And also how uncertain people were of computer technology in its infancy.)Interwoven with the stories of rocket tests and trajectories are the personal stories of several of these remarkable women. They came from a range of backgrounds and it was wonderful to read about how different they all were--but how they all shared the drive to be excellent in their cutting edge work. Lots of girl power here, and no back-biting or malicious melodrama. I read a library copy of this book, but I've bought my own copy to have because I want my kids to all read this and I want to be able to pass it around to friends."
274,0316338923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3809399-stormin,4,"It's really hard not to compare this book directly with the (more famous) Hidden Figures: The American Dream and the Untold Story of the Black Women Mathematicians Who Helped Win the Space Race, and the conclusion is simple: Rise of the Rocket Girls is a better book.There are two main reasons for this. First, the book has a more concentrated narrative. Hidden Figures is all over the place, with long, long tangents that don't really go anywhere and no central narrative. It's more of an exhaustive index of things that happened in the lives of female, black computers than a story of any kind. By contrast, Rise of the Rocket Girls has much more accessible themes--like the desire of the female (white and black) computers to be a part of inventing rockets to explore space instead of just to deliver warheads and kill people.Second, the book had really great scientific explanations. I'm not a physicist or aerospace engineer or anything like that, but I do have a quantitative background with degrees in math, systems engineering, and economics. So I do know a thing or two about math, and so I can recognize a really good mathematical explanation when I see one. You know, the kind of explanation where the meaning is clear to anyone (regardless of their mathematical background) but the meaning is also faithful to the actual, technical concept being explained. That's really hard to do, and Nathalia Hold makes it look effortless. This make the book more fun to read, because you felt like you were getting a real feel for the kinds of scientific problems that these women were solving.I can easily imagine that the material in Hidden Figures made for a better movie (I haven't seen it yet), but as far as books go, this is the one I'd read if I had to pick just one."
275,0316338923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/55339687-linds,2,"Yuck.To me, it is nearly invaluable that someone took the initiative to track down the surviving JPL 'human computers' and get their stories. That's something that isn't on record anywhere, and that history, particularly various anecdotes they may have from that time period, is very intriguing.But, yeesh. The way it was put together and the items the author chose to highlight drove me insane. I gave it two stars only because there are, in fact, good bits of information to be found. I do have to applaud the author for getting these women together again. But most of it felt like such a waste of a golden opportunity.The author spends the majority of the book talking about whichever ""rocket girl"" is being focused on and her hair, her clothes, her boyfriend/husband, her children, her troubles at home, etc. I'm sure that plays a part, but I really would have liked that to take more of a backseat. The interesting info about JPL felt more like asterisks at the bottom of the page.I majored in engineering, and I've worked for NASA. I've been the only female in many situations. I support giving these ladies a spotlight. I just think this book is so busy hamming up their gender that it forgets to fully illuminate their accomplishments. The idea isn't to say, ""Look, we're girls!"" The idea is to say, ""Yeah. We're awesome.""(Another book released recently, The Glass Universe: How the Ladies of the Harvard Observatory Took the Measure of the Stars does a much better job of this, for anyone interested. Though I warn it hits the other extreme for any not really keen on the subject. It is quite information and background heavy.)"

However, I just could not finish this book. It read as if it were an outline of chronological events with a few verbs and adjectives thrown in there. There was not one character that I felt tied to enough to want to finish the book. The author jumped from person to person, not developing one single character. So many names were dropped that I could not keep track of who was who. This barrage of women was punctuated by an attempt to connect the reader to them by telling brief, campy quips of detailed information about dresses, beauty pageants, and personal relationships. By trying to cover so much, the author truly did these amazing women a disservice with her poor writing. Had she taken the time to tell one or two stories really well, the book would really be able to celebrate the work of all of these amazing women."
277,0316338923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32637832-anne,3,"The author had obviously done a lot of research, and I really liked that she was able to explain a lot of the STEM stuff so that even an anti-STEM person like me could understand it. But throughout the book, I felt that she was writing at a young adult level instead of an adult non-fiction level. I even checked the spine label to see if our library had designated the book in that way. I know a lot of adults like to read young adult books, but I am not one of them, so I found the tone simplistic and somewhat demeaning. I mean, seriously, I used to OPERATE a key punch machine. I know what one is. "
278,0316338923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7029980-katie-doing-dewey,4,"Review: This was a fun read and highlighted some important work, but I would have liked more depth on the technical side of the story.Long before 'computers' were calculating machines, they were mathematicians (primarily women) and eventually the first software developers. Working at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, an elite group of female computers fought hard to balance personal lives with careers they loved at a time when that was still considered a highly unusual thing for a woman to do. Through their expertise and painstaking effort, these computers ""transformed rocket design, helped bring about the first American satellites, and made the exploration of the solar system possible"" (source).I was initially a bit disappointed by this book. The first story, focused on Barby Canright, spent a lot of time talking about her clothes, her makeup, and her relationships. That wouldn't bother me, except there were also very few technical details of her work and a lot of the story focused on one of the men she worked with. Fortunately, it got better from there. All of the other women's stories also talked about their relationships, but this was balanced by information about the work they did. I suspect that the bad beginning at least partially reflected the fact that earlier women computers were primarily doing math to implement other people's ideas. They weren't allowed to serve as engineers and were probably not often able to suggest experiments.Occasionally, I did still feel that the author was stereotyping the women, (for instance, an older women was put in charge of the group not because of her experience, but because she was 'a  mother hen') but overall the stories got better towards the end. I did really like that the author just told the women's stories, without digressing into discussions of stereotypes and the barriers they faced. She let their stories speak for themselves. And they were great stories! Like in 
Hidden Figures
, the author followed many women over decades, so we could see how many different women chose to balance their careers and how things changed over time. Many of the women worked on incredibly important space exploration efforts. The missions that gave us our first images of other planets were particularly awe-inspiring. Overall, I had a lot of fun reading this book. I just would have liked some more technical details to round it out!This review was originally posted on Doing Dewey"

Superb concept and research. Too bad the storytelling falls short. With so large a cast, Holt often fails to identify her frequent shifts of focus character. Even as an advocacy work, her biases bleed through too obviously. “As odd as it seems by today’s standards, the beauty contest was a result of JPL’s progressive hiring practices … unintentionally highlight the presence of educated young women working for JPL.”Even with its shortcomings this sets the record straight about the vital contributions of the “computers” as they were called before the advent of massive and micro-computers of the last fifty years. “She didn’t feel intimidated. Instead she felt invisible.” “Many saw the shuttle as competition.” It certainly contested budget dollars, if not official and public attention. JPL continued to plan and execute successful scientific missions while most of NASA’s attention and money was wasted on grandstanding with people. (In my opinion, JPL’s Deep Space Network continues to do more science that the International Space Station.)“There was no doubt in her mind or anyone else’s that if they’d gone ahead with their design and put a satellite at the helm and fuel in that final stage, their creation would be circling the earth at this very moment.” (September 2, 1956)See also Hidden Figures, the story behind the contemporary black women climbing an even steeper hill at NASA Langley Research Center (Hampton, Virginia). Don’t understand why neither were nominated for Hugo Awards as related works.“Proper paranoia.” Gentry Lee JPL’s frequent failures highlight the risk when pushing the envelope of the possible. Those now planning to send people to Mars should reflect on the low success rate of unmanned missions to the red planet. “We’re a sisterhood.”"

It takes the reader all the way back to when Malina, Parsons, and a young group of men were doing their own experiments in the foothills, all the way to the 1980's. Now, if you're looking to learn more about women's contribution to this industry, I suggest you read Hidden Figures For a book that is supposed to be about what women accomplished at JPL, it really sings the praises of the men. All I got from this book was that women were computers. It didn't go into any details though. But boy, did it tell us exactly what the men did. Plus for a book about science, I don't understand why women's fashion was a point that needed to be brought up. Yes, there was a female revolution going on, but what exactly does wearing pants have to do with sending a rocket into space? The book says their colleagues didn't care. So why bring up this inane topic in the first place?And don't get me started on the lady that felt sympathetic for a Nazi war criminal. I get that he contributed a lot to science. But.... let's not forget the 6 million people that died!! Their lives are more important to me than shooting metal hunks of debris into space. In conclusion, read Hidden Figures instead!!!!! It's superbly well-written and details the contributions of a handful of women in the space industry."
281,0316338923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64510958-tayler-card,3,"The book The Rise of the Rocket Girls by Nathalia Holt was the stories of revolutionary women who helped pave the way in modern rocketry. The biography is a collection of stories of women who overcame adversities to pursue jobs, men typically had and women could normally not hold. These courageous women were know as computers. They were the mathematicians of the Jet Proportion Laboratory known as JPL. They came from around the United States and even other countries. They held positions of prestige, which had long hours, poor conditions, and many risks, where lives were on the line if you made a mistake. Despite the conditions, the laboratory was a tight group and had multiple outside events together. For the women, they found a second home, a place where they could thrive and not have to hide their brilliance.I personally enjoyed learning about the women's lives and there experiences, inside and out of JPL. The insight of the outside world and knowledge about history I found fascinating.I had a distaste for how much the book mentioned the mechanics instead of the people in the book. I also had an aversion for how quickly characters were introduced, abscond and mentioned much later in the book without any previous reference. I found the book quite intriguing, but a little bland. I did however enjoy the stories, especially the ironic ones. I found the writing style suitable for the content of the book, but it made it slightly difficult to follow. It doesn't really move the reader to activism, it makes you frustrated, but you feel that it's in the past. I think people who enjoy factual writing this book is for them."
282,0316338923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12860715-librarycin,3,"This book follows some of the human calculators who worked for NASA (and the precursor to NASA), starting in the 1940s up to and including the 21st century. It follows both their work and their home lives. Of course, at their work early on, it was mostly women who were the calculators, while men were the engineers. As women of the time, they were expected to leave when/if they got married, then pregnant.I listened to the audio and my interest came and went. What I paid attention to was interesting. As we got closer to current times, with my (for a while) interest in astronomy, it was fun to read about some of those space missions that I remember. Well, the first one I really remember wasn’t a “fun” one, Challenger in 1986, but some of the later ones were: Hubble Space Telescope, Spirit and Opportunity (sent to Mars to take photos and explore; intended on only lasting 1 year on the planet, but lasted 5 and 10 years instead!), and more. Oh, I also enjoyed the one little tidbit of info about Jupiter’s moon Io (which I named my current oldest cat after) – apparently it is filled with volcanoes. "

I was very interested in learning about these pioneering women and the men who supported them in their careers, and it didn’t disappoint on that front. I also learned A LOT about the space missions that I didn’t know. That being said, I got bogged down in the science at times and I was a scientist (albeit a geneticist, not a physicist or mathematician). I also found the story to jump around too much. I guess it was hard to tell all of these women’s stories without rehashing everything a million times but I kept getting lost. Maybe it is my corona brain. At the end of the day, I’m glad I read it but I was also counting down the pages for half the book, which isn’t exactly a glowing endorsement. "

287,0316338923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67951314-phrodrick,3,"Mine is a review of the large print edition, hard back of Nathalia Holt's Rise of the Rocket Girls. This is important because I found the large print edition particularly well bound, easy to read and easy to handle. It is rare that I notice anything about the binding of a book, but this edition does honor to the printer's art. The text however was less than it should have been. This is the history of the women who were the original computers at The Jet Propulsion Laboratory. As a former computer instructor, it always amazed me that most of my students had no clue that the word computer derives from the process of doing math, that people were employed as computers before there were machines to do the math, and that the machine is so named because what it does is math. What I did not know, until reading here is that hand done math had been the preferred method well into the space age. Ms. Holt makes it clear that by-hand calculations were just losing out to the machine about the time America was sending Apollo missions to the moon.What is now JPL began in the 1940’s as three collage age kids operating at great physical risk and minimal permission at Cal Tech. Being young and unsupervised they called themselves, The Suicide Squad. Their lack of safety procedures ultimately forced the school to push them out doors and away from campus. There they reformed as a business the JPL, The Jet Propulsion Laboratory.Their first income derived from their work for the US Army Air Corps developing the rocket engines used in JATO, Jet Assisted Take Off. These were basic jet engines strapped to propeller aircraft for the purpose of helping them launch quickly from short runways. The technique developed in WW II was still in use into the 1960's. Among the things that made JPL different was its willingness to employ women. In fact, the Computer department at JPL became a place where women, later including African American women could find professional level employment as advanced mathematicians. It is rarely appreciated that even in the 1940's and1950's women were able, if they were better than enough men to get advanced university training in mathematics. Most often the only work for them was as primary school teachers. However, there were places in various parts of the emerging world of what we now call High tech for women. It is now emerging that women had leading, if underappreciated roles in the development of Computers (the machines), and computer codes. Thanks to Ms Holt we know by name some of the women in the hard work of doing the math for the development of rocket engines.Returning to this book. I found Ms Holt writing to be vaguely under written. As if she was writing to a younger audience. Clearly, she was avoiding any detailed discussion of the math. Rather like describing how to make a complex menu item and avoiding all mention of the ingredients. Yes, math can be dull, but a better author can help you to share the frustrations and pleasure to be derived by the ability to handle complex math, under pressure and routinely produce reliable results. This is after all, rocket science. To most people this sounds dull. If your goal is to honor these women- and Ms. Holt wants us to honor them- and to inspire girls to follow, a few pages that detail the tedium and make clear the absolute demand for people up to this specialized set of challenges should have been better documented.What is best about the Rise of the Rocket Girls is that Ms. Holt sought out and interviewed the women who were the calculators. We see JPL progress from small military applications to the Apollo Launch pad. These women adapted to and took leadership roles in adapting the original desk calculators, capable of only a few mathematical processes replaced the slide rule. Later we get a worker’s point of view when the first generations of huge computers made hesitant, and cranky appearances before becoming the miracle machines we now barely think of - laptops, and smart phones and etc. These two generation of women learned how to program and master these machines. They are among the first rank of computer engineers. As exciting and inspirational as are the facts, Ms. Holt under serves them. She is given to name dropping. German, in fact ex Nazi Scientist Wernher von Braun, barely deserves his several mentions. Why she has to mention Carl Sagan is an open question. That there is a great deal about clothes, changing styles and the success or failure of their romantic lives may be part of telling “Her-Story” rather than “His-story”. A case can be made for mentions made the pants suits in the work place. But do we need the unrelated history of the invention of panty hose?The Rise of the Rocket Girls is an easy read. History for the casual, even the beach reader. But their work was anything but easy. Maybe asking more of the reader would have made this a better book. "
288,0316338923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4869474-jeane,4,"I really enjoyed this book for many reasons. First off, it was a great micro-history that focused on this historical women and the contributions to science and math and the entire space program, without them there would not have been one. Another reason I enjoyed this book is because my husband works at JPL and so many of the things they discuss in the book I am familiar with from his stories he comes home with. "
289,0316338923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3086584-shanon,5,I love this style of writing.

290,0316338923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14909704-ari-santillanes,4,"One of the main reasons I read is something called ""book fate."" I suppose I should expand the term to something like ""reading fate,"" but here's the general idea: I believe that I have been fated - predestined - to encounter certain reading material at exactly the right time in my life. I do not believe in coincidences.My latest encounter with book fate involves Nathalia Holt's book, Rise of the Rocket Girls: The Women Who Propelled Us, From Missles to the Moon to Mars. The writing style left something to be desired, but the content enthralled me. It is the story of the women who dedicated their lives - certainly their life's work - to the Jet Propulsion Lab (JPL) as computers and engineers from the 1940s to present. I don't read many histories, so how did this one find its way into my hands?My dad gave it to me. He confessed it was a title he hoped to read, but because it was at the end of a long queue, he thought maybe I could read it first. Right there, postponing his own date with the book enabled me to have it at the right moment! On the subject of dads, I started reading the book near Father's Day, and one of the unifying characteristics of many of the women is the early loss of their fathers. They recounted childhoods where their mothers, in a time when it certainly wasn't the norm, supported several children through pure determination and strong work ethic. Though not directly stated, I can infer that this produced a drive in the women of JPL to support themselves. Through realistic depictions of struggle (depression, divorce, raising children and families), Holt shows how many of the women are determined to maintain their independence through work. I feel deeply connected to the women in this respect. I've never considered being a stay-at-home mom, though I tremendously respect the work such mothers do. When I have children of my own, I anticipate that Mat and I will work hard to make our professional commitments manageable alongside our family priorities. That scares me, because professional and filial fulfillment are things that I value, things that often compete. I appreciated reading the stories of women who pioneered the concept of a ""working mom"" and remained intimidated by its implications. It was my goal to get this book returned/loaned to my dad before I left for Anaheim. It's a hardback and I didn't want to carry it with me on a plane. But failing to finish it and with so little to go, it was impossible to leave it behind. This is how fate works; it is not always convenient. Once I made it to Anaheim, all I could think about was its proximity to Pasadena. I stared to wonder: Does JPL offer tours? Would the women engineers working there be flattered or resentful if I geeked out and asked them, fangirlishly, to sign my book so that when I return it to my dad, it has some sacred weight to it? Am I really, in a town where celebrity sightings can happen anytime, fantasizing about meeting more down-to-earth people who just so happen to champion exploration among the stars?The final fated alignment was that Sue Finley's last project was about to culminate on July 4th, when Juno arrives at Jupiter. Though I learned this in the book's Epilogue, I first heard it from Mat when we were flying to Anaheim. As we were waiting to board the plane, literally minutes away, he stepped out of our boarding group to check one more newsstand for a ""good magazine."" He returned with a Scientific American which, in addition to containing many other compelling stories (we may have to subscribe) contained one detailing Juno's mission. Of all the magazines in all the world, he had to choose the one that added to my book! As I read over his shoulder, 30-40,000 feet in the air, I marveled at the constellation of connections between my reading material and my life. "

This book as a bonus gives a history how the term ""computer"" went from being a job description to a thing we all use. I loved learning about how involved the women at JPL were in all the missions."
292,0316338923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9055933-judy,4,"This was one of those books that I wouldn't have read if it hadn't been for my book club. I'm glad I did. It isn't the story of getting a 'man' into space, like Hidden Figures and there is not 'civil rights' side to the story. This is the story of the smart women who worked in Pasadena at the Jet Propulsion Lab to build the rockets that would carry man to the moon and telescopes out to far away planets. It is also the story of the rise of the working woman who wanted a career and a family. These very bright women were gifted mathematicians and engineers in a time when girls weren't suppose to be good with numbers and most certainly not engineering. The author, Holt, focuses on a cluster of ladies who went to work at JPL just was WWII was winding down and stayed with the program until the turn of the century. The reader not only gets to know these precious ladies but gets a review of history from the rise of McCarthyism, to JFK's vision for our space program, to what we owe to it today. Women of a certain age will remember 'not being pregnant' at work and the debate over if 'we' could wear a pantsuit to work. For those who aren't up to keeping track of all the details about rocket propulsion, parts may be skimmed, but focus of these ladies and their wonderful friendships. The author does let you know what happened to each when their careers ended."

There is technical information that might be too much for the average reader and then, there were those who felt the author dealt too much with silly or sexist things about pageants and children or whatever made up these women's lives; (but isn’t that’s just it?), all the silly or sexist things made up the lives of our Rocket Girls. These women worked both outside the home in very demanding jobs and inside the home with husbands, children, family and society which is an all together different type of demanding yet extremely important job, and, at a time when women were considered an oddity if they worked apart from the home. I found this book captivating. There were moments when I wondered “why did the author put that there?” but then I realized those personal tidbits set apart from the highly technical and specialized positions spoken of were no less a part of these women and the times they were living in. This story tells about what the women went through to get to where we are today in engineering, space exploration, military weaponry and even our very own computer systems. These women adapted and struggled in order to make it in a man’s world but in my view and probably more important is the fact that each of these women enjoyed being women, and through it all were willing to sacrifice and strive for not only personal recognition and gain but also for the gain of future generations of women choosing to excel in mathematics and the sciences. This sisterhood remains strong in mutual respect and admiration because of their close knit working conditions and the friendships formed over time. Through the long hours endured and their strong, exacting work ethics they helped to achieve greatness and prosperity for our country first and foremost but also for a myriad of others who have taken what they started to the next levels.The author has written a fabulously warm-hearted and scientifically beautiful story of intelligent, witty and memorable first female engineers that deserves a top rank in your reading list. If you just couldn’t make it through the paper version I urge you to listen to the audiobook. Narrator Erin Bennett has provided a genuinely flawless production (well, there might have been a technical word or two she found difficult, but there’s not many who can say external disturbance-gravity gradient effect, magnetic-field torques, solar radiation and aerodynamic drag or radioisotope thermoelectric generator three times fast). Her voice was strong, easy to listen to and without excessive drama. Nathalia Holt brought the women to life but Erin Bennett took them off the page and let them live the past once again right before us.I hope you find this story as amazing and inspirational as I did.5 stars overall"

Hidden Figures: The American Dream and the Untold Story of the Black Women Mathematicians Who Helped Win the Space Race
, a book I desperately wanted to like because it is both so important and timely as well as the basis for an upcoming film which happens to look great ... but that other book, sadly, stumbled in several stylistic or organizational ways, which is not a problem here in Nathalia Holt's record of some different women who happened to be doing the same thing at the same time as their NASA counterparts as documented in Hidden Figures. But comparisons are doomed to fail; these books are attempting different things, and while Rise of the Rocket Girls doesn't pack the same punch in commentary on racism, it covers altogether different territory in its examination of the complex and ever-evolving relationship between motherhood (specifically) and work for these women computers. And it does so with clear organization, accessibility of language and thought, and a deft touch with the research. Complicated principles of orbital dynamics and so forth are woven in, yes, but always at the service of the narrative through-line, which tracks a slowly-changing group of women through the decades. Each section is organized around a handful of the larger group, and these women are highlighted gracefully and with care. The personal narrative voice breaks through occasionally, but not distractingly so. In short, stylistically, this is the book to read if you're looking for a primer on women computers in the space age; the content of other books like Hidden Figures may prove enlightening (and the jury's still out on the Junior edition of that book, which hasn't returned to my library yet) but they lack the energy and clarity of this book."
296,0316338923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34366105-lynette-caulkins,5,"Wow! Fantastic non-fiction read! In telling us the story about the women of the Jet Propulsion Lab, Holt brings us a the bonus of another angle of the rise and development of the space exploration era. This one peers at the history from outside Cape Canaveral/Kennedy, and thus provides a fuller understanding of how widespread the industry has been - there is so much more than ""just"" NASA. This book will appeal to a broad spectrum - men and women, older and youthful. While containing trivial memoir-style annecdotes that infuse the more technical discussions with personal interest and keep the book from getting heavy, it's not a Chick Lit piece that would bore someone like my husband (in fact, he's reading it now). (And don't take my words to indicate that he's a chauvinist, because he's no such thing, and he loves strong female characters - just, living in a house of all women and girls, he sometimes feels that certain books or movies have ""too much estrogen for me right now"". This book definitely will not do that for him.) The writing is very engaging, so no yawning over Holt's work. Rise leaves me wanting to find recent books about the planets and their moons, and wanting to find out more from my father about his time working on the Space Shuttle programming. The only way this book could be better is if the title used ""Women"" instead of the diminuizing ""Girls,"" as these were all very much adults, and highly accomplished and respected ones at that.Oh yeah, and now I'm going to play the recordings from Voyager's gold record while I make some minestrone soup. . . Thank you, Nathalia Holt, for one of those reads that pull your mind into its zone long after you've turned the last page. :) "
297,0316338923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5005999-victor-harris,2," Very uneven and got lost in the narrative it was trying to tell. It jumps between detailed discussions of - if you will - rocket science, to low-level prose almost geared to a high school audience. It had the annoying habit of repeating how tired the women were while holding a demanding full-time job and trying to raise children. Mentioning it once or twice would have clinched the point.  The nomenclature of the time is interesting. These brilliant women who were at the cutting edge of rocket, military, and space technology going back to the late 30s and early 40s, were actually designated as "" computers."" This was obviously before that word had taken on strictly a mechanical, technological connotation.  The most striking parts of this account were the descriptions of the multiple failures as America was finding it footing in the increasingly intense competition with the Soviet Union in the Space Race. It is remarkable how many of the misfires were a product of pure carelessness; often with tragic effects. A topic with a great deal of potential but the themes did not get adequately developed and frequently got mangled in the delivery. A low 2 rating."
298,0316338923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4403212-amber,5,"Anyone who talked to me in any capacity in the week I listened to this book heard me sing its praises. Not only did I learn a lot about rocket and planetary science, but I felt like the women in this book, though we are separated by two generations, got me. They were trailblazers as women in science and math. They broke social norms of being working mothers when only 20% of women with small children worked. They paved the way for my generation to have what we have today. Yes, they were paid less and weren't allowed (at first) to be engineers; but, they made it possible for the rest of us. Special shout-out to the women who discriminated against men and only hired women to act as ""computers"" at the Jet Propulsion Lab (JPL). I had serious PTSD flashbacks to Mrs. Semro's geometry and algebra II when the author talked about using carbon paper while making computations. Also, thank you, Suicide Squad, turned JPL, for hiring a bunch of women.Bottom-line, every young woman should read this book. Had I read this book when I was younger, I may not have fallen victim to the stereotype of women in STEM. Read, read, read."
299,0316338923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24011982-cynda,3,"3☆ I started reading this book for womem's history month and the misplaced the book for a few weeks. It had been 3 weeks since I had left the book at a friend's house, so I had to slog through the entire book out of some sense of committment. I am going to have to re-think committment to books. I wanted to give this book 2☆. Maybe I am being generous. Maybe I am grateful for a little more technical I formation about rockets and outer space and beginning-estimate (that's a word :-s) history of automated computers and rockets and space travel. Maybe because it is unfair to rate this book with Hidden Figures: The American Dream and the Untold Story of the Black Women Mathematicians Who Helped Win the Space Race felt sluggish to me. That is in comparison. To compensate for my big social comparison, I give this book 3 ☆ when I wanted to give less."
