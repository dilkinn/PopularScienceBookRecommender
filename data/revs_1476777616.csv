0,1476777616,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3915342-billie,4,"After reading this book, I feel smarter but also still incredibly stupid. I am fascinated by the study of physics and by the amazing discoveries still being made in the field, but, no matter how much I read, I still feel like I just don't really understand physics. And that's okay. I'll just keep reading, as long as patient (and passionate) scientists like Krauss continue to write books that attempt to explain the field to laypersons like myself."
1,1476777616,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57906727-lew-watts,5,"A couple of weeks ago, and shortly after starting this book, I had the benefit of hearing Lawrence Krauss expounding his thoughts at a book launch in Chicago—he speaks as well as he writes, and his explanations are full of humor and allegory. Who can resist this approach to relativity? Krauss is driving his car at (say) 30mph, with his 2 year old daughter in the backseat. Suddenly, she projectile vomits at 10 mph onto his head. The vomit is therefore traveling at 40 mph, but to an observer by the side of the road...I'll let you fill in the next sentences.While later chapters are, perhaps, less imaginative (though much more rigorous), Krauss is able to introduce and explain some of the most astounding discoveries on the path towards the still-elusive Grand Unified Theory. I found the deeper significance of the Higgs Boson fascinating, that we exist within a scalar Higgs field that is perfectly poised to allow the presence of galaxies, stars, particles and, of course, ourselves. But Krauss goes out of his way not to attribute this to any act of ""God,"" or that the universe ""was made for us."" Instead, he posits a more humble explanation, that we have evolved ""in a universe whose laws exist independently of our own being."" I have, however, one complaint—given Krauss' compelling (to me) secular arguments, I found the titles of his 3 major sections (""Genesis,"" ""Exodus,"" and ""Revelations""), and that each chapter is headed by a biblical quote, a little bit distasteful, like rubbing any religious readers' noses in it.The book ends with a critical analysis of what is not known, of some of the uncertainties remaining, some of which are major (dark matter is one). We live in hope that new discoveries can unlock these so that we may enjoy a further edition of this wonderful book. And by the way, how many science books can claim to have been edited by Cormac McCarthy, or partly written in Christopher Hitchen's guesthouse?"
2,1476777616,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5686119-book,4,"The Greatest Story Ever Told – So Far: Why Are We Here? by Lawrence M. Krauss “The Greatest Story Ever Told – So Far"" tells the story of our hidden world. Award-winning theoretical physicist and iconic defender of reason, Lawrence M. Krauss takes the reader on a five hundred year journey of progressive scientific understanding of our reality. This interesting 337-page book includes twenty-three chapters broken out by the following three parts: 1. Genesis, 2. Exodus, and 3. Revelation. Positives:1.	A well-written, well-researched book.2.	A fascinating topic in the masterful hands of Lawrence M. Krauss, revealing our hidden reality. “We cannot understand that hidden world with intuitions based solely on direct sensation.”3.	Makes use of a clever analogy between the once “greatest story ever told” the Bible, to what truly is the greatest story, the one told by science. The book is broken out into three parts: Genesis, Exodus, and Revelation. Each chapter begins with a chapter-appropriate Bible verse. 4.	Good use of diagrams to complement the narrative.5.	Dr. Krauss may be a great scientist but he also has flair with words. “Surely that is the greatest contribution of science to civilization: to ensure that the greatest books are not those of the past, but of the future.”6.	So is there a plan or purpose to the world we find ourselves in? Find out.7.	The value of the scientific method. “Today, Plato’s vision of “pure thought” has been replaced by the scientific method, which, based on both reason and experiment, allows us to discover the underlying realities of the world.”8.	This is also a book of the greatest scientists that ever lived. “I don’t believe in hero worship, but if I did, Faraday would be up there with the best. Perhaps more than any other scientist of the nineteenth century, he is responsible for the technology that powers our current civilization.”9.	The contributions of Maxwell. “After Maxwell, electricity and magnetism were no longer viewed as separate forces of nature. They were different manifestations of one and the same force.”10.	The great Albert Einstein. “Thus, on the surface, Einstein’s Special Theory of Relativity appears to make physical reality subjective and observer dependent, but relativity is in this sense a misnomer. The Theory of Relativity is instead a theory of absolutes. Space and time measurements may be subjective, but “space-time” measurements are universal and absolute. The speed of light is universal and absolute.”11.	An interesting look at light. “In fact, light also behaves like both a particle and a wave, depending on the circumstances under which you choose to measure it.”12.	The Heisenberg uncertainty principle. “The Heisenberg uncertainty principle epitomizes in many ways the complete demise of our classical worldview of nature. Independent of any technology we might someday develop, nature puts an absolute limit on our ability to know, with any degree of certainty, both the momentum and position of any particle.”13.	An interesting look at quantum electrodynamics. “The theory in which these virtual particles are incorporated, along with the electromagnetic interactions of electrons and positrons, called quantum electrodynamics, is the best scientific theory we have so far. Predictions based on the theory have been compared with observations, and they agree to more than ten decimal places. In no other area of science can this level of accuracy be obtained in the comparison between observation and prediction, based on the direct applications of fundamental principles on the most basic scales we can describe.”14.	Provocative facts of science. “The entire stability of the nuclei that make up everything we see, including most of the atoms in our body, is an accidental consequence of the fact that the neutron and proton differ in mass by only 0.1 percent, so that a small shift in the mass of the former, when embedded in nuclei, means it can no longer decay into the latter.”15.	The basis of atomic physics. “In 1925, Wolfgang Pauli proposed the “exclusion principle,” which disclosed that two electrons could not occupy exactly the same quantum state at the same time and place, and which laid the basis of all of atomic physics.”16.	Particle physics. “Over the 1950s, Gell-Mann would produce many of the most important and lasting ideas in particle physics from that time. He was one of two physicists to propose that protons and neutrons were made of more fundamental particles, which he called quarks.”17.	Superconductors. “In other words, Anderson’s nonrelativistic argument in superconductors did carry over to relativistic quantum fields. The universe could behave like a superconductor after all.”18.	Throughout the book, Dr. Krauss namedrops Nobel Prize winners and their discoveries. “But a mere year later, in October 1979, Sheldon Glashow, Abdus Salam, and Steven Weinberg were awarded the Nobel Prize for their electroweak theory, now validated by experiment, that unified two of the four forces of nature based on a single fundamental symmetry, gauge invariance.”19.	The importance of gauge symmetry. “And at the heart of all of the forces governing the dynamical behavior of everything we can observe is a beautiful mathematical framework called gauge symmetry. All of the known forces, strong, weak, electromagnetic, and even gravity, possess this mathematical property, and for the three former examples, it is precisely this property that ensures that the theories make mathematical sense and that nasty quantum infinities disappear from all calculations of quantities that can be compared to experiment.”20.	Discusses key characteristics of the CERN machine. 21.	The Standard Model discussed. Negatives:1.	No formal notes or bibliography!2.	The layperson will have difficulty following this book. There is no kind way to put it, topics like particle physics even at its most basic are very hard to follow.3.	A step down from the masterpiece that was “A Universe From Nothing”.In summary, this is a very good though more scientifically demanding book. Even at its most basic, the layperson will struggle to follow the scientific progression that Dr. Krauss lays out. Readers with science aptitude will obtain more enjoyment from reading this excellent book than your average person. It’s not the masterpiece that “A Universe From Nothing” was but it’s a solid sequel worth reading. I recommend it! Further recommendations: “A Universe From Nothing” by Lawrence M. Krauss, “Farewell to Reality: How Modern Physics Has Betrayed the Search for Scientific Truth” by Jim Baggott, “Spectrums” by David Blatner, “The Elegant Universe” and “Hidden Reality” by Brian Greene, “About Time” by Adam Frank, “Higgs Discovery” and “Warped Passages” by Lisa Randall, “The Grand Design” by Stephen Hawking, “The Quantum Universe” by Brian Cox, “The Blind Spot” by William Byers, and “The Fallacy of Fine-Tuning” by Victor Stenger.

3,1476777616,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43106631-brian-hayes,2,"I have discovered a new super dense narrativeless substance, this book. ""Unless you are a blind devotee of Krauss, you will most likely not enjoy this book. His dislike for all things not science inappropriately seeps into this science book. He bizarrely opens each chapter with biblical scripture. The title of the book is the closest thing to click bait in the literary world I have come across. I am sucker for the kind of book I thought I was buying, ultimately this book reads like a history of particle physics, and is extremely technical or badly presently in places. I would suggest that you almost need a University level education in physics to truly grasp it . Not for the average popular science lay person. Full disclosure, I did not much like Krauss before reading this book, his latest book has only strengthened my feelings. This book is not without its merits, there is a somewhat good overview of the development of ideas in physics, but ultimately it's done so with no joy, no warmth and takes needless detours into areas which he does not need to. I believe he has published some papers of merit but I think we have all jumped the shark to utter his name in the same sentence has people such a Feynman, Sagan etc. Bad Philosopher, terrible science writer, decent scientist, would be my assessment which I am no way qualified to give."
4,1476777616,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4460829-11811-eleven,2,This was too smart for me. I'm throwing in the towel halfway through. I imagine this would be more enjoyable for people who don't suck at science.
5,1476777616,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2531665-charlene,5,"It doesn't matter that what Krauss wrote about in this book has been well told many times over by other authors. I will read anything he writes because he always writes from a perspective filled with immense awe. It is a particular treat to listen to him narrate his own books in audio version. He comes off as humble, generous, curious, excited, intelligent, and completely inspired. It always makes me wonder how he can be friends with Richard Dawkins. Every time I read or listen to Krauss, I feel certain Dawkins must annoy him often. They are so very different. Whenever Dawkins writes, he is a total name dropper. It's not so much that he is captivated by the work his peers have done, whenever Dawkins name drops, it seems to be with the sole purpose of confirming his affiliation with the neo-Dawninian gang,and I mean gan in the literal sense. Dawkins et al. constantly threaten progressive scientists who challenge their work. When Krauss writes of the work done by others physicists, it is clear he has a deep and genuine appreciation for what they have taught the world. When Krauss challenges the concept of a supernatural man in the sky, he does so without sarcasm or meanness. In every page, it is clear that Krauss is just so very in love with how the universe works, he cannot bear to keep it to himself and is compelled, absolutely compelled, to share The Greatest Story Ever Told with others. And even if you have heard it before, I doubt you can help falling in love right along with him. "
6,1476777616,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10326608-lindsay,4,"I thoroughly enjoyed this look into the development of the Standard Model of particle physics that goes into both the history of the discoveries and what was discovered in enough detail that I was both educated and challenged. I felt the framing conceit detracted from the overall though. The bible is sometimes called ""the Greatest Story Ever Told"", and Krauss presents this one as both more interesting and relevant. I agree, but it comes off here as arrogant and needlessly offensive, and the frequent bible quotations begin to come across as grating once the science starts really getting underway.All that being said, this is the most accessible and complete explanation of the Standard Model I've seen that's quite frank about what's still missing in our understanding. You probably want to be at least passingly familiar with some of these concepts before reading though: I felt the book skims over some fundamentals that the author takes for granted (relativistic theory for instance), but a good high school science education should be enough of a prerequisite."
7,1476777616,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1339246-gendou,5,"This is a wonderful book about the history of the cosmos and of humankind's quest to discover its story, which Krauss and I agree is the greatest ever told (so far).There's a lot of focus on particle physics, gauge symmetry, and the discovery of a theory which accurately describes the strong and weak nuclear forces.This book is a must-read for any fan of particle physics!I did catch Krauss in one tiny mistake. And I'm proud of it. In chapter 10 he says neutrons ""... make up most of the mass of heavier nuclei and thus most of the mass in our bodies."" So I crunched the numbers, and it turns out this is incorrect! http://thephysicspolice.blogspot.com/..."
8,1476777616,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23195904-radiantflux,2,"72nd book for 2018.About one-third into the book I started to dislike Krauss, by the two-thirds mark my dislike turned to a mild form of loathing. He comes across as smug and arrogant. He makes no effort to explain complex physics in a manner that would be accessible to average reader. And he peppers the book with stupid rants against religion. The title is beyond ironic.It's just all an ugly hot mess of a book.2-stars."
9,1476777616,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16362429-vance-j,3,"I had great hopes for this book. Even at just 300 pages, however, it seemed 50 pages too long. There's some good stuff here, but if Prof. Krauss had perhaps stuck to the science instead of wandering in and out of attacks on organized religion he would have produced a much tighter book.  These attacks didn't add anything to the book - in my view - and I do remain puzzled why he included Biblical references at the intro to each chapter (plain weird considering his tone throughout the book). I will say his references back to Plato's allegory of the cave - how we grope through trying to make sense of what we see - was clever, but clever does not a great book make. I can sum up Prof Krauss' subtitle: ""Why are we here?"" To him, it's a total accident. There, I saved you $30! :)"
10,1476777616,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37248999-ginger-griffin,5,"Looking to understand the ultimate nature of reality, but not into drugs? Try particle physics! And start with this book, which provides an excellent introduction to the subject. BTW, just want to say that if the Higgs field condensate transitions to a lower-energy state, well ... this universe was fun while it lasted. ;-)"
11,1476777616,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1305908-nina,3,"So I really like science history and stuff, but so much of this was just so over my head that I had a hard time paying attention. I guess I wish it was just a bit more narrative and maybe a little faster. It was still interesting, but I wanted the more recent stuff to be a little more generally described so I could get a better big picture understanding of what we know now. "
12,1476777616,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1976637-jeff,4,"I've been a fan of Lawrence Krauss for years. I've heard him on podcasts and read him in Scientific American but have not read any of his books as of yet. When I heard him announce that he wrote a new book I kept an eye out for it at my local B&N so I could get on it right away.  The Greatest Story Ever Told -- So Far: Why Are We Here is primarily the story of the discovery of the building blocks of the the universe at the subatomic level which are being used to explain how the universe came about and why it behaves the way it does. The book is divided in to three chapters: Genesis, Exodus, and Revelation, and, as the name of the book suggests, the narrative is an analogy between the Bible's ""greatest story"" and the actual unraveling of man's understanding of the universe based on natural discoveries rather than supernatural explanations. Krauss even adds a Bible verse to the beginning of each chapter for further effect. The book begins with an excellent prologue which really got my blood pumping and piqued my interest. The first chapter begins with the Allegory of the Cave from Plato's  Republic  which the reader may remember from high school or college science. Krauss refers back to the Cave Allegory throughout the book, relating it to particular discoveries. The book gradually picks up steam as we meet the greatest scientists of all time beginning with Newton and learn the details of the greatest physics discoveries of all time ending with the those of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). What I liked about the book were the stories of the numerous scientists who advanced our understanding of physics. For most scientists, Krauss fills in their background, proposals, and discoveries in an interesting and personable way. Krauss knows many of the contemporary scientists personally. He spends a lot of time discussing recent discoveries, notably the Higgs boson which result in Peter Higgs winning the Nobel Prize in 2013. And one can't help but have an increased admiration for the giants that went before Higgs such has Faraday, Fermi, Gell-Mann, Planck, and many others.Probably my favorite part of the book was the section about the LHC, which Krauss states is the ""most complicated machine humans have ever constructed"". The three pages Krauss uses to list the characteristics of the LHC boggle the mind! For example: the LHC's 27 kilometer tunnel ring, located 175 meters below the pastoral Geneva countryside, utilizes 1,600 super conducting magnets, most weighing over 27 tons EACH; the alignment of the beams used for collisions are so precise that adjustments have to be made for the moon's gravity based on it's position to Geneva; and the cooling superfluid used keeps the magnets operating at a temperature less than two degrees above absolute zero, colder than the radiation background in interstellar space. I need to find a book about the incredible LHC. The book delves deep in to complex physics subjects such as quantum theory, antimatter, electromagnetism, relativity, superconductivity, and gauge theory. My only complaint of the book would be that some of the chapters reminded me of how I felt in of my advanced college physics classes - my brain hurt trying to wrap my head around some of the concepts. Much of this is just too complicated for the average reader to grasp. Overall, it was an interesting book and I learned a lot. The greatest story is still being written and one needs only to pay attention to the latest science news to watch it unfold."
13,1476777616,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30469739-nick-mclean,5,"This book is a fascinating journey through modern particle physics, with an emphasis on the strange, confounding but inspiring world sub atomic physics. Lawrence Krauss structures his book like a scriptural text or one of Homer's epic poems. His decision to begin each chapter with a quote from the Bible is surely a cheeky nod to his own atheism, noting that scientists can use the techniques of religion while discarding its certainty and dogma. The three sections of the book: Genesis, Exodus and Revelation follow a broad trajectory from Newton through Faraday, Einstein and towards modern figures like Glashau, Feynman, and Higgs. In the Greatest Story Ever Told So Far Krauss manages a delicate balancing act. He writes eloquently and clearly but still captures the science in all its puzzling complexity. Be warned this is not an easy subject. This is not to say it is a laborious tome, just that sub-atomic physics might be the most complex branch of science, and anyone without grounding in these fields will find themselves re-reading passages in this book. Krauss writes for laypeople, but he refuses to condescend to his audience by simplifying incredibly complex material. Many readers will be at least loosely familiar with Newton and Faraday and Einstein, but Krauss details how scientific progress is painstaking, sometimes whole branches are revealed to be false, other times neglected branches of main fields take on new urgency because of practical discoveries. And technological development enables us to discover things that were invisible to our forebears. Krauss takes readers through quantum mechanics, electromagnetism, and the electroweak force, electrodynamics, supersymmetry and efforts of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) to discover secrets of the strong force and dark matter. The book ends with the discovery of the Higgs Boson and speculation about the promise and peril of further discoveries at the LHC, and how what is or is not discovered may confirm elegant theories or reignite interest in other theories. Whatever happens, Krauss humurously notes, scientists will be surprised. Having one's theories backed up by evidence is every bit as surprising and unlikely as having to go back to the drawing board. And every answer, every discovery just opens up a new litany of questions and further searching. It is an enlightening read. Normally I find scientific overviews entertaining, but the least interesting type of science book. Krauss in his professorial way makes complex science accessible by trusting in the intelligence of his audience. I was particularly fascinated by the developments in the latter 20th century. In many ways it was a golden age of physics. Glaschau, Weinberg and Feynmann transformed the field. The more we learn, the smaller we seem in the great scheme of things. Yet the author notes that the lack of definite answers need not depress us. Knowledge of our ignorance, in this sense, is inspiring. We have so much more to learn. At the end of the book, Krauss reminds us that one of the most exciting things about science is that the best chapter has yet to be written. Discoveries this century may transform the way we see the universe. Those of us who are not participating can still enjoy the ride. "
14,1476777616,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75331626-phil-livingstone,2,"Picking up this book in the airport bookshop I half expected it to be generally accessible. What I got was a thought provoking but poorly composed academic text best left on a university library shelf. Although great to get the messages of the book out there, the exposition is terrible. I can only presume that the editors let it through as they didn’t understand it. Even the title includes “why” when the author constantly says never to use that term and ask “how”. Classic academic cash cow material. I’ve watched a YouTube video on the standard model theory since and gained more knowledge from 10min of that than half a day reading this. As for the usual Richard Dawkins style of dismiss all other thoughts in favour of science, the book was typical. Surely any good scientist should recognise that even scientific approaches might be flawed. Evidence of massless and virtual particles for example isn’t explained.To challenge the author’s analogy directly, this book doesn’t show how far out of the cave of shadows we have come - it shows how far we’ve dug into it.If this had been presented as “a brief history of particle physics” then it would have got a stronger rating - that’s all it is."
15,1476777616,http://goodreads.com/user/show/102977481-wyatt,5,"Lawrence has a way of making science read like poetry and has an ability to simplify the most complex ideas in such a way that most readers will comprehend and digest fairly easily. This book is beautifully written and works not only as an introduction to quantum mechanics but also as a book of science scripture. Perhaps rather than bibles they should provide this book in the nightstand drawers of hotels. I think everyone should read this book, especially those who have many questions about the world, galaxy and universe they live in. This will open your mind to the science worldview and show you the importance of science not only as a field of study but a way of life."
16,1476777616,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5917740-nilesh,3,"This summary, popular science book has almost nothing new to offer and does not have the easiest, most engaging explanations to compensate either.With a plethora of great books written on relativity/quantum mechanics in the last ten or so years, the task for anyone to come up with something good in telling the story of Galileo/Newton onwards, with a large portion of the book elaborating on the discoveries of the first half of the Twentieth century and then completing with the latest, is extremely difficult. Mr. Krauss traverses this usual journey in the most unremarkable fashion.The highlight of the book was perhaps in the beginning when the author is dealing with electromagnetic discoveries surrounding Maxwell. From there on, the book continues to decline partly because of the short length (quantum phenomenon and relativity needed more leisurely explanations to drive the points home. As such, a large part of the book in the second half turns incomprehensible) and partly because of the constant shuffle between scientific arguments and arguments on the lives of the scientists. The author does make occasional great points or draw analogies that make one understand better than in other such books. Yet, such instances are few and far in between."

Krauss’ love of science. It is roughly 336 pages. The book covers from the 17th century to the 21st century. It is a comprehensive book that will significantly increase your knowledge and understanding of science. He introduces concepts with understandable dialect, and visual representation.Krauss implements ideas in a way that will make you audibly say oh, he makes the book interesting and involves you. He gives you different perspectives on matters, and uses clear and functional analogies. He successfully attempts at tying the make you want to learn and discover new things.I really enjoyed it and recommend it for anyone who is competent. It is more interesting than a lot academic books. Not only that, you can gain a better understanding of important scientific facts that are set in the framework of an enticing story line."
23,1476777616,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24646888-paul-skorupskas,5,"A thoroughly entertaining and fascinating look at the history of scientific discovery starting with Newton all the way through to today. The book loosely follows the structure of the bible, however I think that the story of Plato's cave example, which is revisited many times in the book, from several perspectives, serves as a better and more helpful structural anchor for the reader. Lawrence Krauss does a brilliant job explaining some very difficult concepts. Some cannot really be grasped without exploring them mathematically, but the author provides enough to get the general ideas, if not more. Highly recommended for anyone wanting to learn about our physical understanding of the world, how we got to this point, and what we still have yet to learn. What is really interesting, is what we still do not even know that we do not know."

25,1476777616,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2855874-greg,5,"This book is worth buying on the intro and epilogue alone. They are a beautiful philosophical discussion answering questions like, ""Why do we even bother searching for answers to these questions?"" and ""Do we need divine powers to explain the universe?"" and ""Why are we here?""Krauss tells the story of the universe as we know it so far from the viewpoint of a particle physicists, so, unsurprisingly, it centers on our broadening knowledge of fundamental particle physics. I am well versed on electromagnetism and basic particle physics, so the first half was review, though his presentation further clarified my knowledge and was presented in a fascinating way that still provided countless learning opportunities.The second half of the book goes into some very dense theory, mathematics, and experimentation that has led us to where we are today. I grew quite lost on most of the more advanced concepts, but I feel that with a few readings, I could start to at least get the gist of what physicists are going after.Even though the material is difficult, it is presented in such a way that everyone will take away a ton of new knowledge and greater understanding of the fundamental forces and particles making up their lives, as well as their purpose and place in the universe."

Rather than labelled 'The Greatest Story Ever Told: Why Are We Here?"" it should have been ""Tiny Stories About The Times I Met Other Scientists: What Am I Trying To Accomplish With This Book?.""Krauss writes this book like he is preparing a lecture in the style of a funny, engaging, and nerdy professor. And you know what, that is probably exactly what he is and what he is doing. And that's great and probably makes him a great teacher but unfortunately that does not work as a book.This book is not serious enough to be a scholarly history of physics nor light enough for newcomers. Krauss spends half his time telling us that he found this physicist to be ""shy and gentle"" or another ""creative."" Krauss actually spends half a page telling us a story about cufflings and how this helped him remember another physicist's name. These never ending comments on the personalities of various physicists do not belong in this book which never finds out what it is trying to accomplish. Krauss never answers why we are here nor tells us a great story. I honestly don't understand why this book became well known. There are much better options out there.One Word: Aimless."
27,1476777616,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5838785-ivana,5,"Once again, Lawrence Krauss blows my mind. Elegantly and beautifully written, this book covers the history of scientific progress, from the early days of particle physics theories, to the discovery of Higgs boson, and the questions that still remain about Grand Unifying Theory. Krauss is truly masterful with words, and his love of science and nature's mystery is palpable. Every book of his I've read left me feeling in awe of the fundamental laws of nature, infinitely grateful to continue to be a blip on a cosmic radar. "
28,1476777616,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19059859-sean,2,"Not impressed. Book starts with a slam of religions. The analogy of adding velocities by using his daughter's projectile vomiting from the back seat + his car's velocity should not have made it past an editor/publisher/1st review. Chapters are all titled with religious passages, yet he drops the religion discussions and just plows through standard cool physics stuff. Then chapters don't really have strong conclusions. I got about half way through this book and returned it to the library. An incredibly rare feat for me, as I love physics."

30,1476777616,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1853260-will-peterson,4,"A summary of the amazing physics discoveries over the centuries from Newton to now. Despite 4 years of engineering school, I never heard so many physics facts explained in intuitive ways without getting bogged down by math. Why does time move slower as one approaches the speed of light? Why is the photon massless? The nuances of particle physics are second nature to Krauss, so when he got deep into the discovery of various quarks and W particles, I had to sort of let the information wash over me. There's just no way I could keep it all straight in such a cursory introduction. But the details of the particles isn't the point: it's the way the discoveries were made and what the discoveries mean. Krauss' passion for the physics and his pure adventurous curiosity bleed through the pages.I had the privilege of listening to Krauss introduce this book in Philadelphia, the first stop on his book tour. Believe it or not, his ~2 hour presentation was even better than the book: focused on the awesome parts and didn't get bogged down by the details of the particles. Maybe he'll upload a video to the internet sometime."
31,1476777616,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28844416-diane,5,"This was amazing and beautiful I am holding back tears. I've had the privilege of attending one of Professor Krauss' lectures on particle physics in person for the occasion of this book's launch. He's a fabulous orator so I greatly recommend this book as an audiobook.This was an interesting discussion on the millennia of science and thought processes that have led from the philosophy of Plato's cave, to the new theoretical physic's research in dark energy and the start/end of our universe. Simple enough for a non-physic's major and detailed enough to keep a science nerd hooked and awed.Because of this book, I'm going to email my university tutor tomorrow about the possibility of doing a master's in a subject that will bring me closer to the physics and technology described in this book, so that I may live every day in the tearful wonder that I experienced reading this. Science is awesome.Disclaimer: I'm a computer science/engineering student so can't judge how understandable this book will be to none-scientist. I would say quite a lot, as Prof. Krauss draws great analogies, but I wouldn't know. "
32,1476777616,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1345046-todd-martin,1,"“I loved the fight scenes and the sex scenes were excellent.”-	Eric Idle {in what is literally, the best part of the book}The Greatest Story Ever Told—So Far: Why Are We Here? is the story of the profound success that theoretical and experimental physics has had from Isaac Newton to Peter Higgs. The book is by Lawrence Krauss, a theoretical physicist and cosmologist who is a professor in the School of Earth and Space Exploration at Arizona State University (or used to be, but I won’t get into that here). After an extended discussion of particles, Yang-Mills symmetry, quantum field theory, superconductors, quantum electrodynamics and every physicist who has won the Nobel Prize, Krauss spends the final chapter discussing cosmology and the recent successes of LIGO (Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory). Intrigued? Well … unless you have an advanced degree in physics, I’m afraid most will find the book to be a complete waste of time. This is because Krauss fails to establish the requisite baseline of knowledge that the reader would need to comprehend the esoteric topics covered in the text. I say this as someone with 2 master’s degrees in engineering who took 3 semesters of undergraduate physics (Newtonian, Relativity, Quantum). Despite this, I really wasn’t able to follow the bulk of the book. Some may blame the reader for this lack of comprehension, but in my experience this has all the hallmarks of a writer with a poor grasp of their audience (something Krauss has in common with a number of scientists who attempt to write popular books). In case you have any doubts, Krauss spends an inordinate amount of time on Gauge Theory, a topic that is more typically covered during masters or PhD level coursework (though this would obviously be more math-centric than the treatment Krauss provides). Feel free to get a taste of this yourself here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauge_t...As to the book’s title … do the discoveries of physics represent the ‘greatest story ever told’ or does it represent a self-congratulatory pat on the back by a physicist to his profession? A little of both, but before smugness sets in it’s worth noting that the mutually reinforcing relationship that theoretical and experimental physics has had largely came to an end sometime in the 1970s with the development of the standard model of particle physics. Since that time, theoretical physics has hit somewhat of a dry spell, with the leading theories (aka string or m-theory) being unable to make a single testable prediction. As a result, the experimentalists have had to resort to confirming predictions made some time ago (such as that of the Higgs field, which was first proposed in 1964). This brings the tag ‘So Far’ and it’s implication that there is much more to come into question. As to the ‘Why Are We Here?’ subtitle … the true answer to this question, as Krauss rightly points out, is that it was an accident … an answer that is about as satisfying as this book. "
33,1476777616,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36069918-ramon-van-dam,3,"Where the previous book by Krauss (A Universe From Nothing) handles the finer details of the cosmos on a grand scale, this time he focuses on an area that is less familiar to me: particle physics and specifically the history of the research on the area. While the information is very interesting, I felt myself drifting away sometimes during the long sections where he describes who came up with what.My favorite parts were his in-depth explanations of how particle accelerators such as the LHC work and his great analogies when explaining relativity and virtual particles. I have to be honest and say that I didn't really grasp large sections where he dives into the finer details of many specific particles, but that's also what makes this a fascinating research area.Recommended for anyone who wants to know more about the current state of physics, but only if you are already somewhat familiar with the subject matter."

Took me back to daydreaming in school whilst a teacher explained things that I wasn't really interested in! Never mind. If you're heavy into physics or physics sciences then this is the book for you. If not, stay away and don't be fooled by the title like I was! "
43,1476777616,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1357580-richard,3,"Right off the bat, I will admit that I did not read the entire book with understanding. The concepts, theories, and discoveries Krauss explains get more and more complicated as the narrative goes on. I just wasn't willing to invest the time to more fully understand what Krauss was attempting to convey.There are a few reasons I wasn't willing to invest more effort. First, I felt misled by the title. I wasn't expecting a guided tour of the history of the science of physics to this level of detail. Second, and more importantly, as I read, I became less and less sure that the author would ever get to the ""Why Are We Here?"" part. Ultimately, in my opinion, his answer is essentially a shrug.In retrospect, I get it. In the author's opinion, this is indeed ""The Greatest Story Ever Told"", the story of how the universe works at an intrinsic level, but only ""So Far"" because we don't know all the answers, and some of what we know is probably wrong. I don't know that I needed an entire chapter on the history of various particle accelerators in order to understand the bigger picture, but whatever. Krauss obviously knows a lot about that, and it was kind of interesting.My biggest complaint is that Krauss mars his own work by continually taking swipes at religious faith, especially Christian faith, and the Bible. There was no need for that. Just tell us what you know. I'm not an especially religious person, but I found it offensive that he felt the need to keep putting down those who believe in a Creator. In fact, the mockery runs through the whole book. the major sections are named Genesis, Exodus, and Revelation, and he begins almost every chapter with a verse from the Bible, one senses sarcastically. Only after wading through the first 20 pages of attacks on religious belief did I notice that 2 of the blurbs on the back were written by noted atheists Penn Jillette and Richard Dawkins. That should have given me a heads-up, the one from Dawkins especially.Krauss also seems to be having a feud with Deepak Chopra, because Deepak gets put down a couple of times. Again, boys... take it off line.I did notice an apparent inconsistency. Earlier in the book, we are told that light travels at constant velocity, even if the source of the light is itself moving. A light shining at you from an oncoming train is traveling toward you at the same speed as a light shining on you from a caboose at the end of a train traveling away from you. But on page 98, he says that that ""Light travels faster in warmer, less dense air than it does in colder air."" So, maybe he is saying that the medium light travels through does affect its speed, but he never really explains that. I was left scratching my head on that one.Overall, I think Krauss does about as good a job as one can do - with a few exceptions - explaining the subject matter he chose to tackle. I took off one star for his off-topic jabs at religion and the religious."
44,1476777616,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3692244-rev,5,A bit technical at times but always always always awe-inspiring. I'm also a huge fan not only of Krauss himself but his writing style. It's so accessible and easy to follow. This book makes me want to go back and revisit A Universe From Nothing.
45,1476777616,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13536962-amanda,2,"It's a strange world we live in, as Krauss attempts to show us in THE GREATEST STORY EVER TOLD... SO FAR, and you know what, what is great? That the scientific method has made it possible to understand how the universe works, on the big scale and the infinitely small scale, is a wondrous thing. But I have to say, I don't think Krauss' latest book manages to show that. I enjoy Krauss' writing in general; I adored his book A UNIVERSE FROM NOTHING and am usually quick to read his contributions to different magazines and newspapers. However, this book is apparently the exception.THE GREATEST STORY EVER TOLD... SO FAR is another book that shows the scientific journey; from Newton to today. How we went from understanding the objects that we see in everyday life, to the smallest particles in the universe (that we know of). The beginning, regarding objects we can see and touch, is solid. Krauss's explanations are worth reading if you're new to physics, but if you aren't, you've already heard most of it. When we move onto the more complex theories, relativity, quantum mechanics and particle physics, we're on a rocky road; Krauss's examples and comparisons are, while not wrong, complex as well and I don't think they do justice to the concepts. It's understandable; they have little or no easy comparisons to the Newton mechanics; no falling apples here, no. It's difficult to explain it to readers without a mathematical background, and given that the math itself can be difficult, it's easy to see how there might be a glitch in communicating the theories. Krauss knows his stuff, there's no doubt about it, but I don't think this book is better at explaining where modern science came from or where it is today. You'll like this if you're a fan of Krauss though. If you're new to these pop-science books, you'll probably like it you enjoy Krauss' writing. If you're not a fan of him, have read several books on this subject, or if you can't handle Krauss' jabs at organized religion, you probably won't love it or even like it."
46,1476777616,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26674095-gy,5,"Awesome! Over 1000 reviews with average rating 3,82! Congrats Professor Krauss!One of from my favorite authors. Is this book brilliant? Yes, it's an awesome scientific read, profoundly reasoned and planned to address the cosmological ""Big picture""! Is there anything I don't like?! Yes, there is! I do like the way and the dynamics the author steers and unfolds the story, but generally, I think, stronger devotion to eloquence would make the read more enjoyable. Since my TBR pile is pretty huge, I'm sensitive on my time. The future reader should take into account my 5* rating, just to make sure my critique on eloquence will not discourage you.The future reader... You wanna best from this book? You simply must have at least basics about the Standard Model! What's the best I found captivating? Well, the underlying concept of writing the new greatest story over the old greatest one, and doing it transparently so you can read both stories comparatively simultaneously, but somehow under the aegis of a Biblical GER (Genesis, Exodus, Revelation) trio, was a dramatically stupendous idea...just to underline its importance with an oxymoron.What was that, it's still driving me wondering over?! I hope I'll be not judged to harsh for this claim, but I noticed in both ""Universe ex nihilo or Why is there something rather than nothing?"" and here, a very strong, almost compulsive like, author's desire to steer us from being a significance junkies! Whatever is the source of this tendency, intentional atheistic reflex or deliberately planned motivator that should keep us awaken during our nights when instead of thinking about how, we like to think about why, in my case it's a driving force that pushes and stretches my imagination so that I'm able to ask a questions from ""are we divine creatures?"" to ""are we just a thermonuclear waste?"".Great book!

And when I say 'we', I mean about 5 guys at Cornell. Without the Higgs boson we wouldn't be here; it represents an asymmetry in quantum mechanics, just as there was an asymmetry at the beginning of the universe, for this I refer you to LK's book Atom.

I loved Krauss' previous book ""A Universe from Nothing"" (4-stars), but I ended up just skimming through this one. It starts off with the tired re-telling of the Plato's cave analogy. Then it goes on to cover the same history of science I've read many times: Faraday to Maxwell to Einstein to Plank, etc. I did find the information on the discovery of the neutron and neutron decay interesting, but then we get to the discovery of particles that no one outside of a collider cares about. There were pions and tau mesons or something like that. There was so much that I just started skimming. I suppose at one point, he must have gotten to the Standard Model, but by that point the book was due back at the library and I'd had enough. Give me cosmology, relativity and quantum mechanics all you want, but I'll never read another book on particle physics. If you disagree, then maybe this book is for you."

50,1476777616,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43898175-bob,4,"The Greatest Story Ever Told - So Far indeed! Krauss begins our story of science, discovery and the human component of those in Classical Greece with Plato and his allegory, and ends with a discovery of immense proportions that, while groundbreaking, only brought more questions than answers. And in the end, I think that's the point Krauss is trying to make here (along with what feels like a PhD course in particle physics): we should not be content with a version of our world, or our place in it, in which all the answers have been given to us. Not by hard work, discovery, and acquiescence to our insignificance, but given by the desire to feel like we are in some way special. Starting with Plato's cave allegory, and ideas of how light was crucial to that allegory, we delve into the modern discovery of what light is, and its impact on our understanding of the world. Light then continues to take us on this journey through the discovery of new particles, new physical relationships, and new theories of both. Again, and again theorists and experimentalists must revise these theories to fit with new discoveries, and our views of our world and our place it is changed ever so slightly. Each time it is both exciting and frustrating, as I think we all agree we as humans prefer a pat, clear solution. What we find instead is that the universe doesn't exist for us, and we must accept that.Krauss does a great job of infusing the human part of the equation in his stories of revelation and discovery. It's not just about the science here, it's about the people who worked on that science, and I found that to help immensely when caring from more than an academic standpoint. It was also refreshing to hear about some of the (to me) more esoteric people involved in these discoveries. We all grew up reading about Einstein and Dirac and Dawkins, but the people like Glashow, Weinberg and Rubbia are equally important, and in some cases had a more hands on impact on the world of physics. The book does tend to get scientific at times, so I would recommend both more than a passing interest in physics as well as a basic understanding of some of its concepts before beginning to read this. I made it through about halfway before I read and reread passages as well as had my phone handy to check on terms or ideas I had either forgotten or were glossed over. Additionally, I found some of Krauss' choices for criticizing other, less scientific views of the world didn't really land. I agree with his sentiment, but it felt out of place in this book. I absolutely found this a worthwhile and fascinating read. Beyond some of the more difficult scientific discussions, it was enlightening, entertaining and informative. It's ignited a new passion for learning more about this world of physics, and I will definitely be revisiting it with some more experience under my belt."
51,1476777616,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1376431-kem-white,5,"This is an outstanding book though it does have some annoyances.Krauss sets out to explain 420 years of physics: from the first description of inertia given by Galileo in the 17th Century to the Grand Unified Field theory of the late 20th Century. And do it in a short 300 pages. Be warned... at times your head will swim. But considering the complexity of the concepts he is describing, this is to be expected. Remember Einstein's dictum: ""Make everything as simple as possible. But not simpler."" Krauss hews to Einstein's advice perfectly. If you're coming to this book thinking you won't have to reread paragraphs, scratch your head, or really cogitate about what's being said, you're in for a rude awakening. But it's absolutely worth the effort. Krauss describes theory, experiment, and human accomplishment that is incredible. Can I say that I completely understood everything that he said? No. But his descriptions are clear enough that I understood most things, and vivid enough that I appreciated everything. And I loved the history and biography of the scientists behind the discoveries. There are some annoyances with this book. Chief among them is there are no equations! (Save for the venerable E=mc^2) It's all words. Newton's Second Law and Planck's Law are well-known even to high school physics students. Could he not have presented them simply to show how concisely physics explains the natural world? Maxwell's equations are beautiful in presentation and breathtaking in significance; Krauss should have shown them. I don't know Dirac's Equation, but I would have loved to have seen it. Krauss constantly refers to the underlying math of the concepts he's explaining. Would that I could have seen some of it, if only in an appendix. I also tired of Krauss's incessant references to the Nobel prizes and university credentials of the physics luminaries he describes. I guess this is something physicists appreciate. You need some prerequisites to appreciate Krauss: background (i.e., college) in physics and math, a desire to think about what you're reading, and excitement about physics. Finally, I did take up Krauss's challenge to answer the question: ""How many piano tuners are there in Chicago? (p. 130)"" The answer I came up with was 174. In Krauss's estimation, I did well. I wish I knew how many piano tuners there really are in Chicago to confirm my answer.This book is highly recommended for anyone in the fields of science, engineering, and math. It is recommended for everyone else. Though my guess is your appreciation of this book is directly proportional to your facility with science."
52,1476777616,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41431387-mike-morgenstein,5,"The greatest story ever told, so far, isn't written in the most famous book ever: the Bible, or does not substitute reality for venerated mythology, and is not encompassed within the scope human existence. Rather, the greatest story ever told reaches far back before the first religions were established, before our homo-sapien species branched from our chimpanzee-like ancestors, before evolution by natural selection was conceptualized; thus before organisms existed, before our planet suspended in orbit around our solar system, before the primitive explosions that made the suns we see and the solar system we inhabit, up into the very inception of the universe as we know it. Krauss tells this story through the perspective of physics and cosmology (well to be honest it can only be told from that perspective before Earth came about). In this book we take a journey through modern civilization, and while we chart scientific advancement we start from the first scientists and progress to where we stand today. Throughout modern civilization up until probably Netwon, scientific inquiry did not prevail in law and in sentiment but was rather enshrouded in a dark cloud considered to be arcane and often heretical. The author captured this nicely but this great story shined the most when he spoke about 20th century physics (a big part because he was a scientist that spent most of his youth in that century and have also worked with preeminent scientists that have played a big part in the greatest story). Although Lawerence Krauss is a very good explicator (I came to realize this when I read his book 'Quantum Man') there is a lot of technical information and for someone without a scientific background like me it is very hard to cruise through this book without your full attention. It is definitely one of the most difficult reads I've ever had. Did it have to be so hard? Who knows. I certainly don't and therefore I can't really fully knock him for it though I believe some technical discussions could have been curtailed. What he does do though is write with fervor, an unencumbered passion for science and a requisite penchant for rationality. And as it turns out, despite the amazing discoveries that have been made within the past two centuries, there are many more to be discovered and therefore as we stand today, the greatest story ever told is not yet finished but in progress."
53,1476777616,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64785453-andrei-khrapavitski,5,"Just finished listening to the audio version of “The Greatest Story Ever Told--So Far: Why Are We Here?” This is a new book by Lawrence M. Krauss, a really great educator and an important voice for science and reason. In his previous book, “The Universe from Nothing” (which is also a fascinating read, by the way), Krauss focused on the big question of how the Universe came into existence. “The Greatest Story” continues to address this question but on a different scale. Krauss retells the story of physics, in particular particle physics as it progressed through the XX century. He explains some heavy stuff here, like gauge symmetry, the standard model, the findings in the field of quantum electrodynamics and the Higgs field. He briefly touches upon the cosmological inflation and the recent discovery of gravitational waves. What I admire about Krauss is that he avoids speculation in his texts. This is not a string theory book with all the crazy stuff which is not proven. This is a beautiful story of human ingenuity, meticulous and incremental progress, unsung heroes of science, trying to make sense of the laws of nature. Don’t miss the epilogue where he becomes speculative. But for a good reason. In this brief last section, he conveys to his readers a sense of cosmic humility. Krauss reminds us that we are here thanks to an accident. Galaxies, planets and astronomers exist thanks to the Higgs field freezing in the state it did in the period after the Big Bang. He compares this field to the ice crystals on the window—and when the sun comes out, those crystals melt. Sooner or later it could happen. “We should enjoy our moment in the sun,” Krauss sums up. And we should keep on exploring the laws of nature, so many of which we don’t understand. If this perspective scares you, the good news is that cosmological inflation, which Krauss considers quite probable, happens eternally, at least, according to most calculations. New universes pop into existence all the time. There is no beginning and there is no end for this process. This leads to all those interesting conjectural ideas about the infinite number of copies of you and me in the multiverse, etc. But you will not find those speculations in Krauss’s story."
54,1476777616,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32507760-starman,4,"In February, 2018, Lawrence Krauss was accused of sexual harassment and misconduct. Of course at this point these are just allegations, but I am sorry to hear. This revelation dampens my enthusiasm for his books, although I realize that no one is perfect and that in some area or another, everyone fails. I once heard that you should not have heroes because sooner or later they make a mistake or some deep, dark secret is revealed that will make you feel disappointed. But then, the same holds for other people when they think about you or me. We all have problems in one area of life or another (or several!). Let him who is without sin among you cast the first stone.I met Lawrence Krauss once, years ago, when I interviewed him for the Denver Library cable channel. It was so long ago I don't even remember the book for sure. It might have been ""The Fifth Essence,"" but I can't be sure. Anyway it was long ago. He seemed a nice guy, if a bit distracted and perhaps.... I don't know, hyper or Type A maybe. I recently finished ""A Universe from Nothing,"" and am currently up to chapter 20 of 23 in his latest book, ""The Greatest Story Ever Told, So Far."" Unfortunately I find much of this book tedious, and frankly it does not deliver on the promise of explaining ""Why Are We Here?"" To be honest, I am continuing to read it at this point just so I can say I finished it.Upon finishing this book, I am a bit disappointed in that it did not really clarify much and assumed a great deal. Readers could benefit from a glossary at the end, but there is none. The knowledge and intelligence of Krauss is not at issue, but this book reflects my opinion of a physics professor I had 4 decades ago, whom I felt was just too smart to sommunicate well. What is odd is that Krauss typically is actually a very good communicator. Too bad.The book starts off reasonably well, but quickly dives into particle physics and theories that will soon put non-specialists like myself into a stupor. There is no math, but the constant referring back and forth between particles and forces and their arcane interactions definitely leaves me wanting a nap. The attempt is to explain nature on a basic level, and how these particle interactions are responsible for reality as we know it, but this is far from explaining why it is like it is. The most basic question, which as far as I can tell Krauss never even touches, is ""Why is there something rather than nothing,"" an old philosophical conundrum which in my opinion is preceded by an even more basic question of why is there something *or* nothing? In Krauss's defense here, I do not think that this question can be answered as it simply evokes an infinite regression of wonderings, but I do think that the book promotion is misleading.Aside from being a physicist and cosmologist, Krauss is a well-known and somewhat militant non-believer. Frankly I think he has been too strident in his atheist rhetoric. Too harsh a stand can hinder the cause.http://bzfd.it/2oqpAk2"

It's absolutely neither a design, nor designed for us.Krauss put more attention on the smallest thing in the universe, articles, to explain how it created the world we are living in. That is why we try to smash the particles to try to find out what could be beyond them. We are driven and created through gravitational, electromagnetic, strong, and weak forces. That's why we are here, at this moment, this universe, with physical forms, with still unexplainable consciousness that Krauss didn't dig in (who could know?)I enjoy his approach to educate the public in a easier language. I have read quite a few of this kind of public science books from Michio Kaku, NdG Tyson, Brian Greene...etc. They are all my favorite scientists. He mentioned several famous physicists as examples to introduce his ideas. Some people argue why he used the biblical names in few of his chapters, since we also know he is hard core atheist, some said he wanted to attract the religious readers. I wouldn't think this way. But if some religious could also embrace the real science, why not?""To argue that, in a universe in which there seems to be no purpose, our existence is without meaning or value is unparalleled solipsism, as it suggests that without us the universe is worthless. The greatest gift that science can give us is to allow us to overcome our need to be the center of existence even as we learn to appreciate the wonder of the accident we are privileged to witness."" — Lawrence M. Krauss ""For most people, the central questions of existence ultimately come down to transcendental ones: Why is there a universe at all? Why are we here?Whatever presumptions one might bring to the question ""Why?,"" if we understand the ""how"" better, ""why"" will come into sharper focus."" — Lawrence M. Krauss "

It is merely evidence of a lack of understanding.”Lawrence Krauss has written a book about how Physicists are working to understand how the subatomic world works. Like several other books I have read about Quantum Physics, I learn a little more by reading but a good understanding of the subject still alludes me. Fortunately, Krauss explains it alludes most Physicists as well. If you like the world of Quarks and Electrons and wish to travel to Europe so the you can see the Large Hadon Collider, this book is for you! If you are looking for a quick guide to how the universe works I suggest you look elsewhere. A major point Krauss makes it that the human mind and senses developed to only take in a small portion of the universe. We cannot see very small things nor very large things, we cannot see very slow things nor very fast things and, therefore we have difficulty understanding them. In fact most of the universe is beyond our sensing and understanding. However, we can create the tools and develop the thinking to stretch out and take in more and more. That is what science is for!I was drawn to this book because I read Krauss focused on how science’s view of the world is different (actually better) than that expressed by religions. While Krauss flirts with this topic now and then, it is not the core focus of the book, even when he tries by starting each section with a bible quote. He does get close to the topic with this quote:“The greatest gift that science can give us is to allow us to overcome our need to be the center of existence even as we learn to appreciate the wonder of the accident we are privileged to witness.”It is a very, very, very big universe and we are but a very, very, very small part. Rather than act as it it was created for us, we should be pleased that chance allows us to be here at all - for now. That is what this book is about and it is a thought well worth writing about. "

Dr. Krauss Texas on a historical journey of the key figures involved in those discoveries that have led us to the understanding of particle physics to date. After this the book falls pitifully short by his interjection of science versus religion. He criticizes man and the religious mine for anthropomorphizing the universe giving at value and purpose claiming that the universe is an accident. Yet, at the same time describes the theory of unification desperately sought four of which as physical particles ourselves we must become a part of. In other words the value and purpose we see is intuitive to our nature on the basis of the field of unification. He claims science to hold the answers that theology does not. That science is edit advantage religion is not because of the ignorance of the people who hold a religious mind. He claims the world is better off because of science. And this is definitely true in Western culture and first world countries. Yet for the remainder of the planet steeped in poverty, which would be 90% of our population, misery continues while only those in Western culture reap the benefits of science. One must never forget that 18,000 children around the world starve to death every day. Will science solve this by tomorrow? Will science and ideologies that lead to war? Will it in greed? Will it end avarice? When will it do so? Does having a mechanism to explain and natural phenomena make our system of believes false? Cognitive science will say no that is not the case. To me, this book would have been fine had it stuck to pure science and it’s explanations of particle physics. But it breaks down into opinion and induction by claiming science proves God is irrelevant."

In this book the author took us on a captivating narrative that displayed great story telling without sacrificing what I think is one of the most inclusive if not the most inclusive explanations of the pillars and paradigm shifts of physics, and that was my favorite thing about this book; that despite its story like nature that presented the topics in historical context by introducing and going into the life's of major scientists (physisits, mathematicians and many other disciplines) and philosophers, the book didn't skim on explaining the consepts quite adequately in a brilliant fashion. The book exploits the historical narrative wonderfully to introduce concepts gradually so that readers start from their comfort zone whereever that may be regardless of their current level of knowledge. One can start reading about classical physics and get taken away by the narrative, getting quite immersed in the stories until out of nowhere he/she finds himself/herself reading about how the understanding of spontaneous symmetry breaking led to the the development of the electroweak theory and later to quantum chromodynamics finally unifying the strong, the weak, and the electromagnet interactions into one theory. Again the book is quite brilliant and fairly easy to to understand. Saddly the book purposefully doesn't go into much detail regarding gravity, hence only very briefly dealing with general relativity and barely mentioning string theory, but the author to his credit does point this out and he and many others have written extensively about it in other works.So anyways the book was better than I expected and I enjoyed it a great deal and got a lot of new information and more importantly a lot more questions out of it."

The writing flowed and it read quickly which was nice, but Krauss tended to go pretty deep into certain concepts without considering the layman reader. I found myself glossing over huge chunks of the book. I know this is partly my fault, however. I've never studied physics, much less quantum physics, aside from being a science enthusiast who enjoys the higher-level implications of a subject like this. I don't know what I expected, but I know that I was disappointed that this book wasn't a bit more accessible. There were plenty of moments where I was synced with what Krauss was talking about, and those moments of clarity redeemed the book in my eyes, preventing me from giving it only 2 stars instead of 3. In particular, I really caught the wave towards Part 3 where he talks about the Higgs boson and the Large Hadron Collider. Those topics were pretty widely talked about in the media, so I had more familiarity with them. Other than that, I mainly enjoyed learning about all of the physicists involved in developing our current understanding of particle physics, represented through the Standard Model. I also like how Krauss explained away some of the pseudoscience that tends to hijack quantum physics concepts.The Greatest Story Ever Told is probably something I will come back to a few years from now after I've learned a bit more from other sources, and maybe my rating of this book will go up a notch. Having completed this, I'm more interested in reading Krauss's previous book, A Universe From Nothing, and I also think I'm going to revisit the documentary Particle Fever soon to see if I can appreciate it even more than I did."
