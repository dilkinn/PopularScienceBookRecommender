I really like that. It is a collection of articles about the subject of nothing. Yes, you can write a lot about nothing.The order of the chapters is a bit confusing at first. I expected a chapter per field, but they explain at the beginning of the book that they have chosen to do it a different way. The first chapter is about beginnings, and it has something about the big bang and about brainresearch. If you read a whole chapter in this book in one sitting, it is a bit chaos. But if you read it an article at the time, the order makes this book easier to read than if they had devoted a whole chapter to on field of research. In that case, I would sooner be tempted to skip something, because I've read enough about brain research already, for example. That is not the case now. So I do see the perks of this, but I'm not a fan of it because the feeling of chaos overrules the surprises you get because you've read something you wouldn't have read otherwise. And than I have an issue with the writing. Most of the articles are interesting, but sometimes I lost what I was reading about. It is a bit all over the place. Sometimes I was even wondering what I've just read. It is in a particular way good because there is interesting stuff in it, but it didn't felt like an amazingly read I've learned a lot from, somehow. It doesn't endure.It just feels badly written and thus it is hard to read. Maybe this is because of the translation, I dont know, so I do recommend if you want to read this, to read the original English version. I think that is better because it are articles fro New Scientist and that is usually very well written! It's not that I notice that the translation is bad, but it feels like something is off with the writing. Very hard to pinpoint what it is that makes me feel like this is not a good book, while it has all the potential and subject to be one. I just had to drag myself through every single page of it.."
1,1846685184,http://goodreads.com/user/show/800291-andrew,4,"This book is almost impassible to describe - with the actual book cover introduction pretty much covering it all off. Its about nothing - from the nothing of space to the nothing your mind does when it is resting - and everything in-between from medication to mathematics - if there is nothing, zero or just a total absence of anything it is discussed - and in their own unique way they are then linked together - it is a fantastic journey and one I think made all the most fascinating by the fact you have no idea what will happen next. It can be a little repetitive in places and in true science paper ways a little heavy at times but but generally it is well written and interestingly presented."
2,1846685184,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2415840-amanda,3,"An engaging grab bag of essays on versions of ""nothing"" in various fields of science: dark matter, the pre-Big Bang universe, the placebo effect, ""useless"" organs, zero, and empty sets. I found the organization a bit confusing, but it is a quick weekend read that is sure to teach you something new."
3,1846685184,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4107783-paul-perry,4,"A very nice collection of longer articles from New Scientist on the theme of Nothing in various forms. I particularly like the cosmology (of course), and all there pieces are interesting in informative, although I have issues with the several that centre on the placebo (and nocebo) effects. These do highlight what can sometimes be a weakness of this type of article, that while explaining an apparent phenomenon it is presented in far too uncritical a fashion, which can lead the less informed reader to place too great a weight on the effect., a particular problem when it is picked up by the general media and further amplified or warped."
4,1846685184,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5867389-sam,3,"More of a three and a half star review for me. This one took me almost three times as long to read as an ordinary fiction or biography book would, but that's not to say it wasn't VERY good reading and a very valuable educational experience. I'd have to say though, this book is very heavy on quantum vacuum discussion and this aspect was what bored me most. Most enjoyable for me were the discussions on the placebo effect, and the later discussions on exercise physiology. In essence the studies of doing nothing. I found the discussions referring to absolute zero temperature to be highly informative and enlightened me on more than one of the scientific elements of the periodic table that my own school education had neglected. I also loved the ""choose your own adventure"" model of organising the book, which I know other readers have found difficult. It allowed me to read the things I was interested in at my own pace, eventually getting through the entire book. This is the reason for the book not seeming to be in any logical or academically sound order, the essays are not meant to be linked together in chronological order. They do not refer to one another and are not supposed to. The contributions are from a group of highly qualified and intelligent people ranging from Paul Davies and Philip Ball to Ian Stewart and Richard Webb and with professions ranging from professor emeritus of mathematics, particle physicist, cell biologist, novelist, journalist and associate professor of material physics. These people also work at varied institutions including but not limited to CERN, NewScientist and various prestigious universities and research facilities. Overall, this is a well researched, and cohesive collective study of different states of nothingness."

The essay on watching paint dry, for instance, was engaging. The one on superconductors, which I expected to be great, was only so-so. Because of that, I'm giving it three stars. But others' mileage may vary, so it's worth at least looking!Standout essays: -The Big Bang-Placebo Power-Zero, Zip, Zilch-Vacuum packed-Boring-ology-Pathways to Cosmic Oblivion"
6,1846685184,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16212136-peter-pete-mcloughlin,3, Was a bit disappointed. This book was published by new scientist a premier science magazine yet I found the book a bit glib and superficial. It didn't go into topics very deeply and seemed to underestimate the readers attention span. meh.
7,1846685184,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5992644-mg-mason,3,"This is a book about nothing - quite literally. It makes something of nothing, quite literally about that too. You will find nothing in this book, lots and lots of nothing and you will find it quite frankly one of the most interesting books you will ever read. Even though it is about nothing, featuring nothing, there is a lot of nothing. Ok, the bad puns have already run out but I hope you get the picture here.This is a New Scientist volume about nothing. I can't really put it more plainly than that. It's about the nothings that inhabit our world, the spaces of nothing and the zero state of nothing. The subtitle is From Absolute Nothing to Cosmic Oblivion. It's a history of the number zero, how medieval Europe struggled with the existential crisis that such a number would create. It's about zero as a mathematical concept and a physical number, its importance to astronomy, to physics and to science in general.It's also about the various zero states that make up arbitrary things such as temperature. We all know that the celsius scale goes from 0-100 with 0 being the point at which water freezes and 100 being at the point it turns to water. But what about Fahrenheit, why is that set the way it is? Why do we need and use so many temperature scales? What exists between the stars? Can we actually create a vacuum? What existed before the Big Bang? While the answer to that question is ""nothing"", it's not quite the ""nothing"" that you perceive it to be - thereby challenging one of the concepts and strawman arguments that creationists pose against Big Bang Theory.It also goes off on a tangent into loosely themed ""nothing"" related subjects. From homeopathy (which is quite literally nothing) to the placebo effect which helps feel better while using nothing, this makes you think about the physical word around you. It presents nothing as a concept, as a philosophy, as a mathematical certainty and as the absence of something - it will show you ways of thinking about nothing in ways you'd never previously considered.I particularly liked the studies of the number 0 and how it provided so much angst for some societies throughout history. Also of interest is what comes next for the universe, the various theories for where the universe is heading billions of years from now. This may change your worldview, it may go above your head or it may teach you nothing you do not already know.The only real complaint I have about this book is that it feels a real mish-mash. That's kind of understandable when you're creating a book from edited articles that once featured in New Scientist but it feels that the editors haven't quite thought as much about its structure. You will find your attention drift at times too as seemingly unrelated sections get shunted together.They explain the general idea of working it the way they did, but it didn't quite work for me. It's confusing and seemingly unrelated in places - a shame because they had the chance to structure it in a way that feels organic and natural with nothing being a natural state of the universe."
8,1846685184,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5996952-tim,3,"""It's time to make much ado about nothing"" says the back of the book. From the origin of the number zero, and the search for the perfect vacuum and the coldest temperature, to doing nothing and the affect on living things.Being a collection of essays from New Scientist first published 2013, some of the material is dating fast, especially in the quantum world and the search for new sub-atomic particles. At least the introduction is aware of this so new editions can be popped out every 10 years or so with relevant updates.My favourite chapters concerned biology, making vacuums, and the search for absolute zero temperature. Bed rest experiments have shown it is bad for human circulatory health, while for other animals the cost of moving versus the energy available after digesting food leans towards sedentary lifestyles. Vacuums are best measured in particles per cubic area instead of the usual bar, kilo pascals or millimetres of mercury.The chapter I found most lacking was about the number zero itself. The potted history seemed to miss how an empty circle came to represent zero for most Europeans. What did ordinary people make of it while philosophers and clerics were debating the meaning of dividing by zero?"
9,1846685184,http://goodreads.com/user/show/87368714-jack,4," A book which gives insights on many topics related to nothing. It gives an informative discussion about the concept of zero as a number, and how it came to be accepted through history. Another topic is the mysterious placebo effect, of which many studies with evaluations are made; it even goes further to describe the nocebo effect. Other concepts about health (why doing nothing is bad for health) and what goes on in the mind when it is doing nothing are also discussed. On the flipside, the book also explains why doing nothing can be absolutely key to the survival of certain animals. Philosophically, what is meant by nothing is also explored, with discussions concerning what existed before the big bang and what goes on in a the vacuum in space.An interesting book with a broad variety of the different sciences involved."
10,1846685184,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25245332-lionkhan-sama,5,"What a superb book!A very abstract layout, with an abstract range of topics split between chapters.All topics revolve on the concept of ""nothing"", and the deeper you get into the book, the more that word seems to mean.A brilliant array of fully scientific articles, from authorities around the world.Ranging between physical and metaphysical realms, the arguments and ideas brought forth within the book are a delicious variety of flavours for your mind to munch on.Another great point worth mentioning, is that the language used is not particularly difficult to understand. Very high level scientific subjects are brought forth in semi-layman terms.Excellent book for just reading on the sideline. Highly recommended."
11,1846685184,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12800930-bharath,3,"This book has an excellent premise and take off. There is a lot to be gained by paying attention to the nothings. It was a long time before zero was accepted. After all the universe also started with nothing or so it may be. However, since it is a collection of essays matter repeats and is at times too detailed. In that sense the book does not take the theories forward in a consistent manner.Nevertheless still recommend it as being well worth a read."
12,1846685184,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4723954-rosemary,3,"I thought this might have some philosophy in it, as well as science, but no. It covers a lot of different topics, some more interesting than others for me. It's one of those chatty popular science books that jumps around a lot, but taking it one article at a time works. The chapters (groups of articles) don't hang together particularly well but each article is cohesive on its own terms."
13,1846685184,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24511135-anshul-thakur,5,"This book is a collection of articles written by authors with an extensive background in science, scientific reporting, and writing. As the subtitle of the book hints, it is a gourmet of articles from varied fields - from the voids of the quantum world to the voids on the cosmic scale, the studies of things that go on in our brains when we do absolutely nothing, and how one can be healed or killed by nothing at all, the story of zero that symbolizes nothing and to the revelations when we try to create nothing and how nothing can create something. This isn't a book review exactly but should give you a good flavour of different nothings.The articles have been organized in an overall theme of a story - a beginning, the mysteries of being, the sense making process, the journey forward and finally the conclusion of the story. This is a heady mixture and it is easy to lose sense of where we are headed. First, we talk about how the universe was formed in sufficient detail, and then we dive into our heads to see where does it spend all the energy as we do nothing at all.My head often hurts when I try to think about the shape of the universe. It is explained to be the surface of the balloon that is being inflated, but we are told it is just the surface and not the interior volume. My mind insists, ""how can I not think of the interior when the surface is expanding"". Did this book help? Not quite, but I am getting better. Then, I never really appreciated the E=mc2 equation from the way it was introduced in school. Yes, it is the mass energy equivalence relationship, but if that is so, what is the mass of a photon? No body explained why it is almost fruitless to think of it that way. The book helped understand. It is the flipped relationship worth looking at to understand it better. Given a photon with sufficient energy, mass can be created. That is how something tangible is created out of nothing. That is what is expected to have been commonplace occurrence during the formative years of our universe. If you have read till here, and are liking it, then there's more of it at Aesthetic BlasphemyRegards :-)"
14,1846685184,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4060448-sundarraj-kaushik,4,"A wonderful book on Nothing. Looks like an oxymoron, but read it to have the oxymoron disproved. The topics covered range from the obvious zero of mathematics, to nocebo effect from the medical field (absolute must read), the effect of zero activity on human body, the absolute zero temperature and vacuum which we assume is nothing.It is interesting to know who Europe resisted the introduction of zero into Mathematics for a very very long time before finally accepting it. The rest as they say is history.Many are aware of the placebo effect. The tests seem to suggest that it is power of ""suggestion"" or the ""positive thought"" that causes the placebo effect. Not many are aware of the nocebo effect which states that if one is given effective medicines, but with a negative suggestion then the chances of the medicine having a negative impact is very high.Vacuum comes as a another surprise. It does not actually mean nothing, it only means that the density of substance is so less that it can be considered to be nothing, but not truly nothing.The negative impact of inactivity on the human body is huge. It takes effect within a matter of weeks and takes quite sometime of positive activity to offset.As a corollary evidence shows that regular moderate activity helps humans maintain their health and even regain their health.The effect of absolute zero on the physical elements, specifically on Helium and how we actually have not reached real absolute zero degree Kelvin is a good read indeed.On the whole a very good book to read."
15,1846685184,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7126954-andrew,4,"This has been on my Goodreads ""currently reading"" shelf for four years somehow, left on pause for months and years at a time. The fragmented nature of a book such as this, which collects various disparate essays, naturally lends itself to abandonment part way through - especially considering the dryer articles about maths. Still, most of the essays in this book are excellent, and filled with enlightening perspectives on topics which relate to the overarching concept of ""nothing"". In particular, some of the lighter stories towards the end, about exercise and ""doing nothing"" were fantastic. There is enough variety in this collection so that most people would enjoy at least one section, however some of the parts rehash some well trodden ideas and the dryer moments might put some casual readers to sleep. 3.5/5 - It has its moments."
16,1846685184,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57973657-robert,3,"The book is a selection of science and maths articles that broadly concern 'nothing'.I found the majority readable straight out the box, but certain areas (primarily concerning chemistry and physics) required a reasonably good working knowledge of scientific concepts (or Google!).A lot of the articles concern what we know about x and how we arrived at that knowledge.The ordering is a little unusual with the chapter content determined on broad themes e.g. 'Voyages of Discovery'. So you end up with a chapter which contains unrelated articles which cover a bit of biology, a bit of maths, and a bit of astrophysics together.I'd only recommend this book to you if you're interested in popular science and you have recently refreshed your basic science knowledge."
17,1846685184,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49466640-christina,3,"I love the idea; an entire book covering the concept of 'nothing' from a variety of angles. Mathematics, psychology, physics, biology etc. The book itself was okay. Naturally, with the broad diversity of subjects covered, there were some topics I found more interesting, others less. The articles are rather short, which sometimes causes them to stay rather superficial, but this way it is also easier as a reader to stay engaged with the texts, even the less interesting ones.As with most 'one author-one chapter' books, the quality of the different articles varies. Some are a bit incoherent, while others are captivating. Three stars seems to be a good average and summary of the book."
18,1846685184,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67108321-jessica,3,"I really enjoyed the concept of this book as I would have never drawn the line between the invention of the number zero, hoodoo curses, vacuums, and the end of the universe. Some of the essays were really good and but some were not so great.I did not like the format of this book. It lacked a unifying flow, I felt as though I was being bumped around from thought to thought and then shuttled back to something previously read. I will, however, likely pick this book up again to read very specific chunks—the essay on boredology was hilarious. I've found that nothing is extremely powerful and quite inspiring and this book has been a catalyst."
19,1846685184,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7487616-peter-aronson,4,"An entertaining collection of short science articles, grouped around the ""theme"" of nothing -- zero, vacuum, what your brain does when you think about nothing, etc. If your the sort of person who likes facts for their own sake (raises hand), then you'll find book this enjoyable. If you want an overall theme that actually connects everything in a meaningful way, then you might find this book kind of pointless."
20,1846685184,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68253295-malcolm-evans,4,"It seems strange to be reading a book which is about absolutely nothing but the more I read the more I am fascinated by the concept of what nothing actually is. Jeremy Webb edits a series of articles from New Scientist about nothing ranging from the introduction of zero, the big bang out of nothing, the effects of taking nothing, a plecebo, as medication to dreams and the way the brain works when it is doing nothing. I am learning lots of intriguing facts I never knew before about nothing. "

But I found of greater merit the discussions dealing with physics (absolute zero, perfect vacuum and so on), then those dealing with Math. Many of these discussions present very recently scientific finds, other present not recent facts but relevant ones that few people know."

The book is chock-a-block with fascinating knowledge, such as that your brain has a “default network” mode controlled by your medial prefrontal cortex; this kicks into gear only when you’re doing nothing. Instead of conventionally grouping the essays by topic (cosmology, mathematics, etc.), Webb “…created chapters around topics such as beginnings, mysteries, and surprises” in hopes of intriguing readers “with the sheer breadth of the ways in which nothing has influenced our thinking.” Valerie Jamieson contributes an especially good chapter on “Boring-ology” which reports on what’s going on “when nothing’s going on,” e.g., you’re watching paint dry (the polymers are all joining together), waiting for your fingernails to grow (1/10th of a mm per day), or watching the grass grow. VERDICT You don’t need to be a nerd to enjoy these likeable micro-histories/lessons. The collection keeps a quick pace, uses non-scientific language, and highlights the excellent writing that goes into New Scientist magazine, from which the essays are all reprinted.Find reviews of books for men at Books for Dudes, Books for Dudes, the online reader's advisory column for men from Library Journal.

26,1846685184,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13962781-amber-leigh,4,"An interesting book, if occasionally a thoroughly depressing/frightening one. If the last section describing the eventual (and apparently unavoidable) end of the universe was intended to sap all manner of hope from me, mission accomplished. I suppose the only comfort is that at least I'll be long dead when it happens. Whoopee?All joking aside, I'll admit to being fascinated by the possibilities. Not just of the 'End', but of more or less every topic explored in this book. I learned more about physics by reading 'Nothing' than I ever did at school, I'll say that much! A few subjects failed to ignite my curiosity (namely the origin of zero, and especially the section on, 
ahem
, boringology... Although maybe that was the point?), but for the most part I enjoyed myself. The sections exploring space and the many mysteries of universe were easily my favourites; I only wish I didn't have to go hunting for each of them. I don't understand the organisational aspect of this book. There were chapters, and within those chapters there were sections (for example on space, on biology, on mathematics etc), and if you wanted to continue reading about a specific topic you had to skip to a specified page within another chapter to do so. I think it might have been a better idea to have each chapter stand it's own topic - just saying.My only other complaint is that the book seemed to run out of steam towards the end. Some of the last two chapter's sections just barely coincided with the over-arcing theme ('Boringology', I'm looking at you). I get it - doing nothing = boring, even though that turned out not to actually be the case. But I don't think I learned anything from that section that I couldn't have learned by picking up a trivia book. Similiarly, the 'super' section had almost nothing to do with... uh, nothing. Superfluids, superconductors and supersolids are interesting, but by that point it seemed that 'nothing' was hardly the issue any more. "
27,1846685184,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29687765-annisa-heningtyas,4,"Nothing is a compilation of various essays written by more than twenty New Scientist authors from different perspectives, every one of them is expertise in each field, from quantum physics, mathematics,biology, psychology, and medicine. It lets us explore a broad spectrum of “nothingness” from the big bang that marked the beginning of time and the universe, the vacuum space, the useless vestigial organs, the consciousness, zero as mathematical concepts, the black hole, the power of placebos, to what happens when our brains try to rest and think about nothing. When I read deeper and look closer to each theme, the bigger “nothing” gets. It raveled mysteries that never came up to my curiosity before.Reading this book is a fulfilling and challenging journey for my scientific knowledge. It is pretty challenging because it took me longer to finish it than it usually takes me for fictions since the most recent popular science experience that I had was watching and discussing Interstellar. The book also has a very abstract layout that it could be a little bit confusing because the topics are rather shuffled throughout the book.Not only challenging our common sense, Nothing is also fulfilling because it reveals glimpses of our consciousness and beyond our universe. It gave me a lot to consider about nothingness and changed how I look at the word “nothing”, that usually implies something insignificant and not important. It reminds me that to understand everything is to understand nothing. As Leo Tolstoy once said in War and Peace, “We can know only that we know nothing. And that is the highest degree of human wisdom.” So if you want to dig some possibilities of non-existence yourself, you've got Nothing to read."

From the Big Bang to human consciousness and beyond, various experts in their respective fields try to explain the concept of “nothing.”This book was a fun read and will be for any science and math fanatics. The concepts and ideas the writers talk about are difficult, but are made easier. That being said, it’s not an easy book. They typical layman would probably have a bit of difficulty getting through this book. However, if science and math have always been an interest of yours, then you will certainly enjoy this book.I also appreciated the fact that there were many disciplines covered. I particularly enjoyed reading all the articles about anatomy, but was surprised by how much I enjoyed the articles on mathematics. The concept of “nothing” is vast, and it’s very interesting to see how it’s viewed by different scientists.My main issue with the book is its overall formatting. The chapters don’t really make a whole lot of sense to me. I would have liked it more if the chapters were grouped by discipline. That being said, if you like an article, at the end they offer similar articles to read. This is a nice feature if you don’t mind jumping around a bit.Overall, I enjoyed the book because it had the same appeal as watching something on the Science Channel: interesting, informative, and a bit challenging.I was given a free electronic copy of this book by NetGalley in return for an honest review."
29,1846685184,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31473206-conor-o-hare,3,"'Nothing' was an enjoyable and fascinating read initially. The majority of popular science books I read have to do with the topic of physics or maths, so I did not anticipate to be as interested as I was in the biological and chemical articles. They provided an insight into an aspect that, of course, the majority of people pawned off as meaningless. How do you examine nothing? What is there to examine? It delved into the idea that nothing spawns a great deal of something, as bizarre as that statement may appear. That being said, towards the latter-half of the book, I found myself in a situation where I felt as if I was reading the same topics, just by different authors. Some topics seemed to be rather repetitive throughout the novel, particularly the concept of vacuums, which I considered to be covered succinctly within the first article. It was almost as if they had nothing else to write about (no pun intended). The majority of the articles were well written (with the exception of a slight few that simply enumerated the many studies performed on the topic at hand). My issue was that the second-half of the book was almost like a recap of what was discussed. In conclusion, I do consider it to be a good book. What I must say, though, is that with the New Scientist magazine, you are spoiled for choice on what subject you want to learn more about, rather than having this book narrow it all down to... well... nothing. "
30,1846685184,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10128373-emma,3,"OverviewI am going to start by saying I am in no way qualified to talk about science. I only actually studied Biology all the way through school and it was far from my best subject. That combined with my complete ignorance on the subject of Physics, this will not be a review on the accuracy of the contents. Apart from the basic knowledge aspects, I don't fell confident enough to talk on that subject. My main issue with this book was the layout. It would jump topics. While I like the idea that there were sections like ""Mysteries"", it didn't work when there were essays that were linked together throughout the whole book. Either do those headings on a wide range of topics or put the essays with things in common together. Due to the fact it is a book of essays, there is obviously going to be parts that don't interest you. For me it was the chapters on vacuums. The first one or two were really interesting but by the end, I just did not care. It seemed like the tried to stretch a lot of essays from extremely similar topics. They probably could have been written as one. At least in a book like this. I also just am not the biggest fan of science so while some of it was interesting, other parts just lost me. If you are interested in science (or maths) and want some information, give this a go. "

Most of the essays are well written and informative and discuss interesting concepts.They tried to be a little too cutesy in the organization of the book. The chapters aren't logically arranged. Instead they have chapter headings like Surprises and Mysteries. Instead of grouping like essays together, they tried to make a ""create your own story"" arrangement. At the end of some (not all) essays, they offered suggestions to skip around in the book to follow particular topics. I didn't care for the approach."
32,1846685184,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10225517-gareth-thomas,4,"I love this sort of popular science book. Means my limited scientific knowledge is challenged and can grow but I'm not confused and bored beyond interest. The range of authors (experts in their fields) across a whole range of subjects that are loosely based around the subject of nothing, make for a varied and interesting read. Take time to read the contents page before buying. That should give you a good insight as to whether you'll enjoy it. What the authors have to say on their subjects is most certainly interesting and well written. As for me, I thoroughly enjoyed it and would recommend to anyone interested in general science. "
33,1846685184,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18448455-adam-hewitt,3,"A collection of popular science articles about the concept of Nothing and topics linked by the idea of nothingness – there’s not much more to say!Many of these subjects have little to ostensibly connect them – vacuums, absolute zero, the placebo and nocebo effects, the number zero, astrophysics, lack of activity, physiological stillness, superconductors and so on. But the ‘nothing’ conceit is a good way of bringing together otherwise completely disparate topics for a quick and interesting look at each, split across many individual articles and topics. It’s varied, stimulating, and doesn’t need to be read in one sitting, but can be easily dipped in and of. Entertaining. "
34,1846685184,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5073725-azeezur-khan,3,"A dash of Physics, mixed with a pinch of chemistry and about a small handful of Biology along with a fairly decent heap of philosophy. The book is a good read, it flows easily enough and the topics are genuinely quite interesting if you've got an inquisitive mind that likes to ponder some of life's bigger questions. Overall I gave it 3 stars because, although informative, if you're looking for something a bit more definitive, this isn't the book to go for. Brilliant book for the average person who has an interest in science/philosophy though."
35,1846685184,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16311110-sue-page,4,"There's a lot more here than nothing! This book is the scientific equivalent of a bag of liquorice allsorts, right down to the layers of different subjects within each chapter. Physics, maths and biology dominate the articles, so there's bound to be something that you know, something that you don't know, and something that you have no chance whatsoever of getting your head round. The final article, which looks at the various theories of future/end of the universe manages to be humbling and inspirational all at once - an excellent way to finish the book. "

Nothing would ever be born if we didnt depart from there.""For someone who's Physics' blunt (me, obv..), this book is manageable. He started the book with simple things then gradually inserted science stuffs, things you'd never read on your own. Its amazing how I actually comprehend the content, took me quite sometime tho. This book taught me that people are likely to dismiss stuff they do not fathom, doesn't matter its important-ness."
37,1846685184,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8630703-snufkin,4,"An amazing variety of essays on nothing! Although some of the essays had a very thin link to 'nothing'...but the whole concept worked well to cover all areas of science in each chapter, and each chapter having a linking theme. Naturally some writing styles I preferred to others, but it's nice in that I got to read essays I would've skimmed over in the magazines. A fantastic book! And hope New Scientist will go on to publish more like this!"
38,1846685184,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6192290-shahrun,4,"Wow! A really mind blowing, thought provoking collection of essays all about Nothing. Who would have guessed that Nothing has so much to do with everything! I must confess that some of the chapters were a little beyond my brain power. But what I did get, I got a lot out of. My personal standout chapters are 'Secret life of the brain', 'Heal thy self', 'Busy doing nothing', 'Boring-ology: a happy tedium' and 'the workout pill'."
39,1846685184,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5140015-ricki-ward,3,"Nothing explores a broad spectrum of ""nothingness"" from the big cosmic bang that marked the beginning of the universe to the development of zero as a mathematical concept (zero didn't exist as a number until fairly recently...this boggles my mind!). The only thing missing is the chapter on Seinfeld, the quintessential show about nothing. It won't be everyone's cup of tea, but if you are interested in science or enjoy obscure micro histories, then you might enjoy this book."

The only fault I could find was that to enjoy the book you do have to remember facts from previous points in the book to understand points later on in the book as the book is ordered in a weird way. This fault may have been partly my own fault however because I did read it in a very stop-start manner as I was reading other books at the time."
41,1846685184,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27810501-vincent,4,"Well chosen articles about a fascinating subject.This has a nice variety of scientific areas, match, physics, medicine and psychology, so if one area isn't especially appealing the area will change soon enough.The articles are all fairly short but contain plenty of information, a mixture of scientific facts, theories and history.Interesting from start to finish."

As one might expect some essays are more interesting than others, and some were skipped entirely. Short stories are not my cup of tea. The book ends with a bang or rather as Hawking has put it ""the Big Crunch""."

Why is that a positive. We'll it reminds us that we are only just learning about this wonderful Universe we just happened to be part of. Give it a go, you have nothing to lose!"
44,1846685184,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26226777-matthew-ardron,3,"Overall an interesting look at what we perceive as nothing, whether in relation to the cosmos, why we need the number 0, and what happens when we think about nothing. Some cutting edge science and not too complex for us layman without a physics degree to understand. Recommend to anyone with a keen interest in science and the world as a whole."

It's in the format of separate articles, meaning there are a diverse variety of topics. Personally, I found the biological and mathematical articles more interesting. It won't be everybody's thing but it's definitely something to read if it is."
46,1846685184,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23521020-signe-kvaskova,4,"Is there such a thing as ""nothing""? Different authors look at the concept of nothing from different perspectives - math, cosmology, physics, medicine and physiology. So everybody can find something fascinating in this book. Placebo and nocebo effects are reviewed too, as well as vacuum, superconductors and the end (or not?) of the Universe. So it's definitely a healthy mix! :)"
47,1846685184,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33329555-stoic-quin,2,Varies from relatively short 'journalistic' essays to some information that's not helpfully explained for a non-science reader. It's also not anywhere as coherent as the blurb suggests - it's essentially a load of articles culled from the magazine that don't really get together or build on each other. 
48,1846685184,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3387843-celine,3,"Some very interesting articles, though occasionally too disjointed. Subjects range from astro-physics to psychology, and mathematics to chemistry. Most essays are easy to read, but sometimes information was repeated several times throughout the chapters which got annoying. It's probably best to read one or two essays a time rather than from start to finish like I did."
49,1846685184,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3321431-kadri,4,"An interesting collection of articles about nothing from various fields - for example about vacuum and absolute zero, but also about the placebo and nocebo effects and what is actually going on in the brain while we're doing nothing. Very enjoyable."

53,1846685184,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24633699-noora,4,Fairly easy to go through. The idea of including essays from different people was a good idea.
