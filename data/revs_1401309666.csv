0,1401309666,http://goodreads.com/user/show/445677-scott,3,"OK, this book gets down-graded because it is an excellent example of snake oil. Kool Aid. Let me explain. I'm sure that some people love this book. However, Chris Anderson takes an excellent insight, then extends and extrapolates this insight all out of shape, drawing general conclusions about the whole economy that make absolutely no sense.First, consider the source. Chris Anderson is the editor-in-chief of Wired magazine. If you've never read Wired, it is a huge media cheerleader for the high technology / IT industries. For example, the articles in Wired display consistent technological triumphalism, like a discussion of the ""death of print books,"" without providing supporting data or a complete picture.The Wired ethos permeates this book. Example: Anderson says that he can point to ""hundreds"" of examples of companies that typify the Long Tail approach, but spends the most page space on a select few: Amazon, Rhapsody, Google, etc. Anderson also focuses on music and books for examples, then makes generalizations about all business enterprises that have no economic basis for manufacturing or other non-entertainment industries. The chapter on aggregation seems to have the general message ""push the inventory problems down to third party suppliers,"" yet this kind of strategy can lead to fundamental breakdowns in your ability to deliver unless you can scale like (guess who?) Amazon - especially when you are talking about cars, refrigerators, etc. that are real products.After 100 pages I could not take this book seriously. It's a shame. The insight of the Long Tail, that you can make a business case for selling a wider diversity of products that aren't ""mega-hits,"" makes a lot of sense. Web technology makes the selling of these products possible in a way that was not possible with brick-and-mortar stores. However, an understanding of how several successful businesses harnessed this idea is not directly generalizable to an entire economy. Making unsupported claims about supposed new ""truths"" does not make these claims actually true."
1,1401309666,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1-otis-chandler,5,"Interesting Tidbits - Three forces need to create the long tail: 1. democratize production: give average people the ability to create quality content (movies, music, blogs) 2. democratize distribution: technology to aggregate *all* the content in a genre (Amazon, Netflix, iTunes) 3. Connect Supply and Demand: filters to help people find the niche's they are interested in (Google, recommendations, best-seller lists) - One quarter of Amazon's sales come from books outside its top 100,000 titles. Thus having a long tail adds ~33% to your bottom line. - Ranking bestsellers across niche's genre's gives little value. Filters to rank items must be applied within each niche to become relevant. Goodreads could improve here. - As the number of niche's increases, the ability of people to consume more content within the genre increases. This depends on the genre, but it gives me hope that we can increase the number of people who read through Goodreads, by creating better filters to connect readers of various niche's.- each year 200,000 books are published in english, and fewer than 20,000 make it into a bookstore. Only 2% of the books published in 2004 sold more than 5000 copies, and can be considered profitable. - There is another factor that determines why people create content, other than money: reputation.- Ebay has 60 million active users "
2,1401309666,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1573101-jake-losh,1,"I disliked this book for two reasons: I do not believe it represents any original ideas and it is, like most business books, horribly verbose. Yawn-zilla. Yawn-a-saurus rex. Avoid.I take issue with the idea that this book even represents a body of original ideas. The long tail concept is very cute, but after reading it, I can't stop thinking about the story of Sears-Roebuck which Anderson writes about. The notion of giving people access to a plethora of products that were heretofore unobtainable has been done before, we're told. The conclusion I drew was that Amazon and other businesses like it simply do the same thing for the world today that Sears-Roebuck did back then, so that there's still nothing new under the sun. Anderson works backward, arguing that Sears-Roebuck represented an earlier, similar long tail phenomenon. The economics of ""abundance"" still seems to me to fall into the realm of orthodox economics of a kind Adam Smith would have well-understood: In competitive markets, price approaches marginal cost. Since bits are so cheap that we can take their cost to be negligible, we can provide more and more varied kinds of bits. Instead, Anderson seems to start by assuming this is something totally new and has to develop an elaborate mythology around it so that he'll have something to write about for 300 pages. Like the Black Swan, this book could have been 50 pages and offered as an ebook, satisfying Anderson's own long-tail definition by not fitting the typical pattern of other boring business books."
3,1401309666,http://goodreads.com/user/show/732169-sarah,2,"I give up...I can't take any more of this horribly boring book. My economics textbook keeps my interest better than this, which is extremely sad. I'm giving it two stars instead of one only because it had a few good tidbits of information regarding the evolution of the music and publishing industries (there was some interesting stuff about things such as Myspace and Lulu that I hadn't heard before). None the less, this is another book about an idea that probably made a fascinating article in a magazine or a slightly interesting online blog, but expanding it into a book took it beyond its attention captivating capabilities. You could easily fit what the book addresses into a multi-page article without loosing any of the integrity of the theory (and without boring the reader to tears)."
4,1401309666,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24423-lilly,4,"This book is an exploration of how niche markets are on the rise courtesy of better distribution. And that's a gross summary. Much discussion is given to the rise of the digital world and how it's expanded the marketplace so that there can be a Long Tail Distribution (for you statistics nerds out there)--- beyond the major hits, you can continue to sell (for example) less popular items, and lots of them. There are markets within markets.A very conversationally written book, by the editor of Wired, it taught me a lot I didn't know about the digital age, the blogosphere, etc, and it's a fun read for entrepreneurs.For some of us it was required reading for a class, but lemme tell you, it beat the hell out of a coursepack!"
5,1401309666,http://goodreads.com/user/show/110449-martin,4,"I’ve been reading what I like to think of as some “business-lite” books for school, pulling me (kicking & screaming) away from my beloved novels, fictional worlds, and imaginary characters. Apparently there is little or no place for novels in business. The good news is that these business-lite books are, by their very nature, super-readable and somewhat interesting. They are also (again, I guess by their very nature) the most repetitive books imaginable. While I like novels, and have even read some relatively challenging ones in my time, I’m not some brainiac devotee of Ulysses and Gravity’s Rainbow and Infinite Jest (never read any of ‘em), so I don’t think I’m holding any of these books to some unattainable standard. Plain and simple: these books repeat themselves like children’s literature. Like a nursery rhyme. Reading Chris Anderson’s The Long Tail was like reading Goodnight Moon with the words “long” and “tail” replacing the words “goodnight” and “moon.”Some theories on this: a) The Captains (not to mention the Lieutenants & Corporals & Privates) of Industry who read these books want to have the main points drilled and re-drilled through their brains for anything to stick well enough to be integrated into their “elevator speeches.”b) These business-lite books all begin as tiny magazine essays, little newspaper columns, or short speeches that are then fleshed out into books, but never really have enough meat on their bones to fill out an entire book-skeleton. (Gross?)c) The writers are bad.d) The readers are stupid.e) All of the above?Actually, I think it’s sort of e), except that the writers aren’t really that bad and the readers probably aren’t that stupid (maybe a little on both scores but just a little). Mostly I think there’s simply not enough substance in any of these books to fill an entire BOOK. Essay, definitely. Pamphlet, sure. Book, nope.This is not to say that these books are not interesting. Far from it. The Long Tail was actually very interesting and helpful in putting a lot of ideas into a cohesive and compelling theory. The central thesis is that in a world of easy digital distribution, choices are so abundant that the so-called ""niches"" are a source of incredible growth. (I can write this from memory, so maybe having the thesis drilled into my brain over and over was, in fact, useful.) With Amazon and iTunes and Netflix (Anderson LOVES those guys!), scarcity of shelf space is no longer an issue, so the online stores can stock everything, and be able to sell a wider array of products to fewer people and still make money. Anyway, I was fascinated by the combination of not just the economic and technological, but also the cultural, analysis. Or at least the economic and technological analyses opened lots of doors to further cultural analyses.Thomas Friedman’s Hot, Flat, and Crowded worked sort of the same way – it felt particularly cobbled together from bits and pieces of pre-existing columns, but still had some thought-provoking moments. Those thought-provoking moments, however, were buried beneath a mountain of simplistic analysis and insanely repetitive writing. After the first 100 pages you can read one out of every four paragraphs and more than follow the arguments. If you think Anderson’s writing is repetitive, Friedman’s has the quadruple whammy of being doubly repetitive AND doubly simplistic. The Long Tail : Goodnight Moon :: Hot, Flat, and Crowded : Where's Spot? And if Hot, Flat, and Crowded is like Where's Spot?, then Larry Weber’s Marketing to the Social Web is like a finger-painting on the fridge. It almost has those huge cardboard pages that tiny, chubby fingers can turn. As with the others, the ideas it contains are not bad, it’s just a book that should have been a 10-page paper. It probably WAS at some point. Why it needed to be torturously extended over 272 pages no one will ever know. Oh wait, I might’ve just figured it out: maybe it has something to do with selling a 272-page hardback book on Amazon for $16.47 and making a whole lot more moolah from it than a 10-page paper that you can maybe post on your blog or hand out to your friends at dinner parties or something.So I get it, Larry Weber; I understand, Thomas Friedman; I see you, Chris Anderson. But it's almost enough to make a reader feel crazy. Every page is like, “didn’t I just read this?” and then sometimes you’re like “I AM READING A SENTENCE COPIED VERBATIM FROM THREE PARAGRAPHS AGO!!!”In conclusion, The Long Tail is by far the least annoying of the three, and it is absolutely worth reading. Hot, Flat, and Crowded – if you ever read Friedman’s columns in the Times, skip it; if you don’t ever read those columns, then maybe skim the book. Marketing to the Social Web...I think you could probably get the salient stuff from just about any blog. Including this one, if you care to ask me.""Marketing, Spot, marketing!"""
6,1401309666,http://goodreads.com/user/show/983888-brooks,5,"I heard a clip on this book on NPR back in August and have had wanted to read this book for sometime. When I first heard about this book, we were having a conflict with one of our e-commerce customers. There SKU base kept growing and my boss kept saying they did not control their inventory. Well, here is proof positive that they did know what they were doing. The book is written by an editor of Wired magazine. The basic premise is that with infinite variety and reduced (and in many cases zero) distribution costs, the non-hits are where the future of profitability in business. Basically, you need low distribution/production costs (democratize production), high amount of content (democratize distribution – aggregators like Amazon and iTunes), and filters to support decision making. Some good quotes, :Walmarts shelves are a display case a mile wide and twenty-four inches deep. At first glance that may look like everything, but in a world that’s actually a mile wide and a mile deep, a veneer of variety just isn’t enough.” Why isn’t WKRP in Cincinnati out on DVD – licensing for all the classic rock that was fundamental to the TV show that can not be license for the DVD. Why is it so hard to find new releases on Netflicks. Because the Studios have a sliding scale on DVD prices that actually decrease by MONTH. So, $20+ in the first two months and sliding out to $10 by 18 months. Statistics – Average blockbuster store has 3K DVDs while NetFlicks has 60K. Average Borders has 100K books, while Amazon has 3.7M books. Walmart has 3500 CDs (or 55K songs) and Rhapsody has 1.5M songs. Internet retail is about 5% of American retail spending, but growing 25% per year. Another good point, with more options, you have a better chance to be more satisfied and also a better chance to be very unsatisfied. More options does mean more crap, but also more gems. Netflicks allows people who do not live in a university town to see foreign and independent films. "
7,1401309666,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73596100-pawel,4,"I’ve read this book many years ago and revisited it now in 2018 as a way to see how many or little things have changed. This is a book written when - quote - “YouTube was a 6 months old website”, and “Netflix will some day go into streaming rather than sending movies on DVDs”. Definitely worth reading on the long tail theory which absolutely applies to today’s market and products. Heck we even see a long tail of products now (apps)! "

9,1401309666,http://goodreads.com/user/show/255684-inggita,4,"one of the most important guides to the dotcom econ - although after a while you might get tired of being told of the same thing over and over again (esp Wired readers might find it annoying of being told what they've discovered a long time ago) each of the stories page after page are another nail on the coffin - and most of us down here in ANALOG INDONESIA with rolling blackouts (wiping out your lifetime of data in seconds) can just dream away. a must-read for non-practitioners, and a good confirmation for us who has an online bookstore... But then, in a fully digital life that's analyzed here, scarcity is a thing in the past. While ""scarcity"" is the center of ""economy"" as a discipline. So what would happen if scarcity is irrelevant? THERE are also two bonus revelations: DEATH OF DEWEY, the decimal system used by libraries to list & store their books collections - NOW we just type any subject/author/booktitle, like GOODREADS here, and we'll find the book - even tho' we don't even know it (a title) exists yet. Not only it renders Dewey obsolete, it will also EXPAND the universe of subject selections of the extremely provincial and limited Dewey (Dewey didn't list Islam and Hindu as part of its Religion subject, ignorant to the fact that a large part of earth's population subscribe to these two religions). More choices ARE GOOD, not paralyzing - as long as we got good selections of more choices, and assistance on getting these good recommendations (see the MIT lady's column) - for example: after the digital world offer more choices for couples, the wedding planner profession grows - where availability and convenience equal more sales. DOUBLE EFFECT of digital search: shorten search + increase sales/grow market.Another phenomenon CA presents is ""democratization of production tools"" resulting in an explosion of works plus distribution channels, subcultures (""microcultures"") grow, the ""mass"" gets less massified.. is this risking nations' disintegration? CA's optimistic that these are only extending our network's power, strengthens the bonds between us and our friends, sharing music/content, even tho' we do ""egocasting"" (pursuit of individual personal taste enabled by TiVo, iPods) - there's no statistics to back this optimism, tho'.. at least mainstream TV producers & daily editors should learn fast; ""The Audience is the Network,"" summarized JibJab's guru Spiradellis, hence the phenomena of YouTube/Google Video, also blogger v. old-school journalism (see Technorati's blog prominence chart, pg 187) - if you don't have time to read the whole book (beware of the Indonesian version, they delete portions of the book - maybe because they can't find the perfect translation!!) read the 9 rules of Long Tail towards the end of the book."
10,1401309666,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1429082-daniel-solera,5,"Chris Anderson's book can be summarized by saying that the consumer retail market these days is driven more by a bottom-up movement (what he calls ""post-filters"") than by top-down factors (""pre-filters""). The idea can also be synthesized by saying that ""hits"" are no longer as big as they once were because they now compete with individuals with louder voices.For example, during its most popular seasons, ""I Love Lucy"" was watched by 70 percent of households with televisions. That kind of homogenized market in TV viewership is unheard of today. You can't draw that kind of percentage even with a presidential address. The reason is obvious: we have so many more choices. Anderson analyzes this in many markets (music, television, clothing, even the button industry) and all yield the same paradigm shift: we're moving towards a culture of niches, one that ultimately complements (not replaces) the ""hits"" we're used to.This is a fantastic modern read. Anderson not only describes with detail and humor the consumerist society in which we participate, but does it with a very relaxed, colloquial tone that allows a quick, enjoyable read."

Anderson presents compelling arguments and data to identify, examine and extrapolate on a clear inflection point in the macro environment today. Tools of production are more readily available (think desktop publishing, blogging, and digital video), distribution is cheaper and more widely available (think Netflix, iTunes or Amazon v bricks-n-mortar), and a wide range of recommendations / reviews / personally-tailored content identifiers are out there.

When the digital book world started really taking off, after Amazon jumped in, I found myself referring to it in discussions of the future of the publishing industry. The internet has allowed businesses to reach consumers (and for consumers to reach businesses) who fall out of the majority--who ""live"" in the long tail. An important book in helping understand the effect the internet has had on retail particularly."
13,1401309666,http://goodreads.com/user/show/88511660-nam-kk,3,"We discussed the phenomenon in our MBA classroom for Long Tail marking an important trend in consumer behavior/consumption. Thanks to the huge cost reduction from technology improvement, from new business model (network/sharing economy), fat tail products could reach farther to its potential customers. The book, however, delivers in a messy and repeated structure. What was delivered in 250 pages could easily done in an half without losing its sharpness and accuracy. "
14,1401309666,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19638210-dane-cobain,4,"This book was a bit of a weird read because it was written far enough ago now that a bunch of its references and case studies are out of date. For example, it was talking about Blockbuster and Napster, which are hardly relevant in 2020.But still, the ideas in this book are super important and have influenced a whole generation of businessmen and marketers, and so even though bits of it felt out of date, it was still very much worth reading. True, if you’re already familiar with the overall concept of the long tail then there’s nothing much here to learn about, but if you’re not then I’d suggest giving this a read to make sure that you are.I mean, with that said, there’s also a whole heap of research and case studies here for you to learn from, although again, you should remember that some of them are out of date. Honestly, this is such a seminal book that the chances are that there’s an updated edition knocking around, so maybe have a look to check that out before buying a used copy, like I did.But overall, I would of course recommend it if you’re the entrepreneurial type. If not, there’s not much point, although it could give you a greater insight into the way things actually work."

""The Long Tail"" (The Long Tail), first published in the United States in 2006. This book mainly introduces the development of the long tail market. It believes that the future of business and culture does not lie in the head of “hits” on the traditional demand curve; it is the long tail of “misses” that is often forgotten. Chris Anderson was born in London, England in 1961. Studied at the University of Maryland, George Washington University. He was the editor-in-chief of Wired magazine, a US technology website. After resigning to start a business. Representative works: ""Long Tail Theory"", ""Free: Future Business"", ""Maker: New Industrial Revolution"", etc. Part of the catalog1. Long tail market2.

Niche culture Rankings, mainstreams, and big hits have always been things that the general public chased, especially in the era of material scarcity; in this case, individual individual needs and preferences are often forced to give up due to objective conditions. When the material is greatly satisfied, people are no longer so superstitious about popular and mainstream, and have the ability to pursue and satisfy their own specialization needs, and even a small number of people deliberately seek to be different in order to reflect their own uniqueness. There are so many kinds of niche needs or subcultures, forming a highly exclusive circle. The number of audiences in a single circle may not be large, but the audience groups formed by many such circles may be extremely amazing. A small circle is a niche market, and it is a gap missed by the big hits with strong versatility . The ceiling of a single niche market may not be high, but when tens of thousands of niche markets are combined together, the overall volume may not be much inferior to the huge body of the hottest, such a market forms a long tail market . In the industrial age that relies heavily on the physical world, the long-tail market is extremely difficult to meet due to cost reasons. Because of the excessively dispersed demand, in this economic system where physical distance is an important evaluation index, there is almost no demand. When the Internet appeared, a large number of virtual products and virtual services appeared with the emergence of the information age. The cost of manufacturing, storage, display, and transportation of products has decreased exponentially, which makes the thousands of less popular niche products in the long tail market may also have good input-output ratios, and even exist or even flourish. possibility. Today we have seen too many such examples, YouTube , Wikipedia , Quora, Facebook, Instagram, Zhihu, Taobao, WeChat official account, Weibo, Douyin and so on. A large number of non-professionals provide a variety of products on these virtual platforms. The vast majority of these products cannot compete with the sophisticated products made by professional teams, but they also have their own small audience. If we put tens of thousands of niche markets add up, you will also find its sum is a monster. In his book ""The World Is Flat"", Friedman expressed his emotion that the power of the Internet has gradually equalized the differences and inequalities in the material world. This is very obvious in the process of meeting the needs of the long tail market. The first is the popularization of production tools. In the past, if you want to generate articles, pictures, and video products, you may need the support of publishers, TV stations, professional film teams, etc., but today, anyone who has only received compulsory education may use the WeChat public platform, Meitu Xiuxiu, Douyin And other production tools to easily produce these products. The second is the popularization of communication tools. The right to speak has been in the hands of the authorities for a long time. When the Internet gave everyone a big speaker, the era of “self-media” emerged for the first time in human history. This can understand why the authorities have extremely strict control over public opinion. The last is to connect supply and demand. Information asymmetry is an objective fact that has always existed and will never be eliminated, but the Internet has greatly reduced its asymmetry. In this process, search engines play a vital role, they tirelessly and accurately match the supply and demand markets again and again. When the author systematically studied the ""long tail market"" in 2004, many products that we cannot leave today have not yet been born, and the reasons for the vigorous vitality of these products are surprisingly similar in nature. We can even guess that many such products will continue to emerge in the future to meet the needs of more people and more specialized. ""The long tail theory actually explains the economics of abundance—when the supply and demand bottlenecks in our culture begin to disappear and everyone can get everything, the long tail story will naturally happen. Before that, the big hit or big Mass production rules everything. Today, although we are still fascinated by the big hits, they are no longer the only market. The big hits are now competing with countless large and small market segments, and consumers are increasingly favoring diversity The curve of customer consumption data sorted by popularity shows that at the head of the curve, several popular songs have been downloaded countless times, and then the curve drops abruptly as the popularity of the track decreases. But the interesting thing is that it has not dropped to zero. In statistics, a curve of this shape is called a ""long tail distribution"" because its tail is particularly long compared to the head. This is the origin of the ""Long Tail Theory"". The head means a single mass production, and the long tail means a differentiated and diverse small batch production. Both coexist in today's market, but the latter represents the future. "" ""When I was a teenager, I was at the peak of the era of popular culture-in the 1970s and 1980s. At that time, ordinary young people had only five or six TV channels to watch, and there were very few programs to choose from. Everyone watches the same programs. There are only three or four rock radio stations in each city, and most of those programs are broadcast exclusively to musicians; only a few rich lucky boys can collect some records-this is It was a fashionable thing at the time. We could only go to the cinema to watch the same summer blockbusters and get news from the same newspapers and broadcasts. If you want to go out of the mainstream world, the only places to go are libraries and comic bookstores. Think about it carefully. I think that there are only two types of non-popular culture that I have come into contact with. One is books, and the other is the stuff that my friends and I fabricated, but these are nothing more than self-entertainment in my backyard. Now, let’s compare my adolescence and Ben. This is a 16-year-old kid who grew up in the Internet age. He is an only child and his parents are rich people in the noble North Berkeley Hills, so he has an Apple Mac computer, an up-to-date iPod player (plus iTunes’ weekly limited download), and a group of equally wealthy friends. Like other people of his age, Ben never knew that this world used to have no broadband, no mobile phones, no MP3s, no TiVo, and no online shopping. The main impact of this smooth flow of information is that people can access a variety of cultures and content without restriction and filtering, from mainstream culture to the most marginal corners of the underground world. Ben's growth environment is completely different from mine. Any traditional media and entertainment industry has far less control over the world than in my time. If you find it difficult to be seated while reading this book, just imagine from the perspective of this book. The reality of his life is a portrayal of our future world. From the perspective of this, there is no distinction between high and low culture. Commercial and non-commercial content and amateur creation are all competing for his attention. He can’t tell the difference between mainstream hotspots and underground areas—he only chooses what he likes from an infinitely long menu. In this menu, Hollywood movies and funny videos made by computer players are juxtaposed. , Regardless of high or low. "" In fact , the life we lead has become the way of life of most people . Compared to our fathers, the Z-generation (1 995 Nian ~ 2010 years) children born have more options. In the early stages of our perception of the world, we have many choices. This has diverted consumer groups that were originally concentrated in a few mainstream hot options . "" Broadcasting has an amazing thing: it can deliver a program to millions of people with unmatched efficiency. But it can't do the opposite—deliver millions of programs to the same person. And this is the strength of the Internet. The economics of the broadcasting era needs golden programs (big hits) to attract a large number of viewers. The economics of the broadband era has been completely reversed. For a communication network that is best at doing peer-to-peer communications, it is in the same It is too costly and wasteful to pass the same piece of information to millions of people. Cultural hits are still needed, but they are no longer the only market. Big hits are now competing with countless large and small market segments, and consumers are increasingly favoring the market with the largest choice. The era of the same thing or one product sold all over the world is coming to an end, and its status is being replaced by a new thing-a diversified market. "" Advances in technology will profoundly affect human life style. So as long as our world continues to undergo technological updates , our lives will continue to undergo rapid changes . "" Niche products have always existed, but as the cost of contacting them has dropped rapidly (consumers find them easier, and they find consumers easier), they suddenly become a cultural and economic force that cannot be underestimated. These new niche markets have not replaced the traditional hot markets, but have jumped onto the same stage as the hottests for the first time. For a century, we have been accustomed to discovering hotspots and discarding everything else in order to maximize Use costly shelves, screens, channels, and attention efficiently. Now, in this new age of networking and digitization, this marketing economics has been completely changed, because the Internet absorbed it come into contact with each line industry, you can also have shopping malls, cinema and radio functions, and costs It's just a fraction of the past. We can imagine the reduction of marketing costs as a declining water surface or a receding ocean tide. As they receded, a new piece of land appeared-it was always there, but hidden underwater. These niche products are great treasures that cannot be found on the map. They contain many products that were not considered economically effective in the past and failed to make it to the table. But many products have always been here, but they are not easy to be seen or discovered. They are movies that have not been shown in cinemas, music that has not been broadcast on rock radio stations, and sports equipment that Wal-Mart has not sold. Now you can get them, either through Netflix, or through Amazon, or just search on Google. The invisible market is now visible. "" "" There are other brand-new niche products created by a new industry that is just emerging. This industry is at the junction of the commercial and non-commercial worlds. Here, it is difficult to say when professionals will give up and become amateurs. This is the world of bloggers, video clan and ""garage bands"" who suddenly found their audience, thanks to the enviable economic magic of digital distribution. "" One of the things I want to do , is to create some kind of tool that can make a person had received only nine years of compulsory education , it is possible to spend one hour to master the use of such tools, and produce some products uploaded to the network , for others to consume. For example , a user can take advantage of this tool is very simple to make some small works , these works of course with professional studio big production are worlds apart, but the victory at low cost. As long as everyone is willing to spend some time, they can transform their ideas into displayable products . Then in the content produced by these massive users , some fine products will surely emerge in the end . "" With unlimited supply, our view on the relative roles of hot and niche products is completely wrong. Hot is products with scarce supply — if there are only a few shelves and a few bands, the only wise way is to This space is reserved for the most popular items. But what if we have an infinite number of shelves? In this case, it may be the wrong way to do business only to stare at the hottest items. After all, non-hot items are far more important than hot items Many, and both are now equally easily available. From the real niche products to the full-fledged “failure products” (super unpopular products), if all these non-hots are aggregated into a market as big as the hot market (not to mention What will happen to the larger) market? The answer is obvious: it will completely change some of the largest markets in the world. "" When the environment changes, the rules of the game also change. If we can't change our approach as the rules of the game change. Then we will make mistakes. Any way of doing things , only can play a role in certain circumstances, if we are trying in all environments use the same approach that we may make mistakes. "" Frankly speaking, this truth is indeed very, very weird. Basically any thing you offer is bought by someone, which sounds a bit weird. It is weird because we generally don’t think about the performance of a product. You can’t sell a single product every quarter. "
17,1401309666,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4632832-nick,3,"Recommended by John Sutherland in _How Literature Works_ as providing a solution for dealing with information overload. I was a little surprised to find myself reading a book about marketing but the combination of an interesting concept and light tone (plus many many hours of subway riding) kept me reading through to the last page. Said interesting concept got much less interesting as the book wore on and I found myself reading more to see where Anderson would finally slip up and say, 'Okay, I admit that there might not actually be a good way for publishers to make boatloads of money off of the internet'. Of course, said publishers make up a big chunk of Anderson's potential market for this book (not to mention the audience for _Wired_). Doctorow published a great review of this book in the Guardian and seems to do a solid job of targeting the major logical fallacy of (near) zero distribution costs, namely that when the cost to deliver a product per customer drops to (near) zero the whole model breaks down because who's going to pay something for nothing? Ebooks are great for authors, but not so much for publishers and retailers.The tip for dealing with information overload that Sutherland gleaned from this book, such as I was able to understand it was that websites like GoodReads, LibraryThing, Amazon, etc can use the books you've already read to come up with recommendations based on what people similar to you have read, helping you explore 'the tail' (the 80 percent of literature that is not in the mainstream canon): ""The 'long tail' approach did not seem to mean keeping within frontiers (like narcotic genre-followers) but mapping out whole new, but not dauntingly large, territories, as a kind of mosaic of freshly discovered discrimination...a gigantic smorgasbord in which the onus was on the skill, and idiosyncrasy, of the consumer, no two of whom would pile their plates identically."" Sutherland seems to see Anderson's point of view as being a little overly optimistic, because he points out that picking out food at a buffet is a lot different from dealing with a 'deluge' of information. The implication that the average person can eat on their own but needs someone to pick their books for them is more than a little patronizing. Certainly, there's a lot of fluff that sells out there, but who's to say what's fluff to me is fluff to you? I think you _are_ seeing more and more small press publishers, like Small Beer Press, Soft Skull, McSweeney's etc, who represent smaller and smaller niche markets which may or may not be based on genre but work by creating small, overlapping 'tribes' of readers, not unlike what has happened in music over the past decade. At the same time, there is more and more room now for random outliers to pick up a huge readership and blow everyone out of the water with a record-breaking Kickstarter fund raising drive. Pre-selling and teaching seems like the way of the future for authors, which may seem a little depressing, but I can't say it's any worse than being forced to sell yourself to a publisher just to get your name out there. The big guys are going to get a lot smaller before all this is over, though, which I can't say I think is all that much of a bad thing."
18,1401309666,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1008236-bookmarks-magazine,0,"In The Long Tail, Chris Anderson offers a visionary look at the future of business and common culture. The long-tail phenomenon, he argues, will ""re-shape our understanding of what people actually want to watch"" (or read, etc.). While Anderson presents a fascinating idea backed by thoughtful (if repetitive) analysis, many critics questioned just how greatly the niche market will rework our common popular culture. Anderson convinced most reviewers in his discussion of Internet media sales, but his KitchenAid and Lego examples fell flat. A few pointed out that online markets constitute just 10 percent of U.S. retail, and brick-and-mortar stores will never disappear. Anderson's thesis came under a separate attack by Lee Gomes in his Wall Street Journal column. Anderson had defined the ""98 Percent Rule"" in his book to mean that no matter how much inventory is made available online, 98 percent of the items will sell at least once. Yet Gomes cited statistics that could indicate that, as the Web and Web services become more mainstream, the 98 Percent Rule may no longer apply: ""Ecast [a music-streaming company] told me that now, with a much bigger inventory than when Mr. Anderson spoke to them two years ago, the quarterly no-play rate has risen from 2% to 12%. March data for the 1.1 million songs of Rhapsody, another streamer, shows a 22% no-play rate; another 19% got just one or two plays."" If Anderson overreaches in his thesis, he has nonetheless written ""one of those business books that, ironically, deserves more than a niche readership"" (Houston Chronicle).This is an excerpt from a review published in Bookmarks magazine."

27,1401309666,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57163298-ofits,4,"This book is a great example of a concept that should have been an essay. In fact, I understand it started out as an article; while the additional examples and anecdotes are nice, I have strong feelings about things that are longer than they need to be. I don't regret reading it, but in the future I will point people to the article rather than the book.With unlimited supply, our assumptions about the relative roles of hits and niches were all wrong ... A Long Tail is just culture unfiltered by economic scarcity.(1) the tail of available variety is far longer than we realize; (2) it's now within reach economically; (3) all those niches, when aggregated, can make up a significant marketThe curse of broadcast technologies is that they are profligate users of limited resources ... this is the world of scarcity. Now, with online distribution and retail, we are entering a world of abundance.What I would consider to be the main thesis of the book:A very, very big number multiplied by a relatively small number is still equal to a very, very big number.the root calculus of the Long Tail: the lower the costs of selling, the more you can sell.One side observation that reminds me of how much recommendations matter in finding a job, even though theoretically job creators and job seekers should be able to find each other easier than ever before:Recommendations serve as shortcuts through the thicket of informationif left unchecked, noise - random content or products of poor quality - can kill a market.Side note that leads to the book I'm now reading:One of the consequences of living in a hit-driven culture is that we tend to assume that hits are a far bigger share of the market than they really are. Instead, they are the rare exception ... The problem is that we have a hard time putting rare events in context.One explanation for why the Boomers and the Millenials will never see eye-to-eye:We've had a change from ""I want to be normal"" to ""I want to be special.""A fun little factoid that makes me rage: Recall the early attempts to sell movies at retail for $70 to $80 - a price that was calculated based on the amount of money a typical family would pay at the box office to see their favorite movie two to three times.Long Tail businesses treat consumers as individuals, offering mass customization as an alternative to mass-market fare.In the end I gave this book 4 stars because the concept is pretty important, but it's a low 4."

One striking example is the use of abundance of paper vs atoms i.e. How encyclopedia came to existence replaced by encarta and then by wikipedia.I head reading the same paragraph twice, reading this books or many of the chapters was like a remix of multiple movies that I have already seen/read.It also a mix of Black Swan Characteristics in it."
30,1401309666,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6687823-isabella-roland,4,"This book gives you a new way to think about the way we create products. Consumers want hyper specific content. Being a generalist is not a good idea when creating products. Selling your product to everyone is not the goal. ""Everyone"" is not your market. You need an ideal customer in mind. Bottlenecks like the cost to get into a business are going away. For example: anyone can not sell t-shirts on Amazon with no overhead. In the past I would have had to get a way to print the shirts, acquire the shirts, build a website, drive traffic, and fulfill orders. All of that is now automated and possible for anyone to do this using Merch by Amazon print on demand. Getting into business is a lot easier today. The Long Tail is from 2006, so you will see a lot of changes that have occurred in the last 10 years. The future of business seems to be selling less of more products."
31,1401309666,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8850000-aman,2,"TL;DR: Meh. Read the review instead of the book. Another one of those superficial magazine articles forced into books. 2.5/5 rounded down to 2 instead of rounding up because it fails in its grandiose claims though this would typically be a solid 3. No it doesn’t articulate anything not understood within the framework of conventional economics. It’s techno-optimistic in that uniquely Valley way - the author notably dismisses the concept of news bubbles in a sentence. Retrospectively, not one of his finer moments. Lastly, for a supposedly futuristic book it is rather tame and doesn’t really try any new prediction (for which at least one could declare it bold) and only extrapolates further on the most obvious trends - anywhere there has been a modification to the model the book has little descriptive power (subscription economies)."

And especially when your commodity is bits and bytes, the cost has declined dramatically, creating all kinds of business opportunities.Worth reading, but it's a bit dated. Mentions MySpace and Sun.

In this case, writing in the mid-aughts, Anderson explains how the internet, distributed production, and changing tastes are transforming retail via the ""long tail"" phenomenon. Clearly and concisely written and persuasive - why not, almost everything he predicted came to pass over the following decade. Almost quaintly optimistic at times, and its fun reading his breathless praise for now-defunct web sites, but also a useful framework for helping understand why companies like Amazon came along at just the right time."

I think just few examples could have explain perfectly about the long tail. This reminds me of the game business on cell phone, unlike standard game business that you need a strong structure of game frames, cell phone APP provides simple and time killing games such as Angry Bird. Sugar crush..etc. They are the successfully example of long tail (Niche market ) which actually dominated even more public than real game world."
35,1401309666,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43608958-tor,3,"The book revolves around the now well-known fact that online retail provides opportunities for lower demand products (long tail), not possible in brick and mortar stores. This gives that actionable advice that you should make your products available online and consider diversifying your product range to supply the many demands in the long tail. However, his data support is rather limited.

Nah. No thanks. If you work in the world of online retail or business, perhaps you'll get more out of this book than I did. (I'm probably in the wrong niche. How ironic.)"

Well thought out argument for why I should always shop on the internet for specific things than try to find it locally.

Written in 2004, the Blockbuster video vs. Netflix battle has been decided, and the iPod was replaced with the iPhone in 2007.

Time, a mere 13 years, has shown that Anderson was on to something but that his optimism about a more open market place didn’t take into account that, yes, they were, and are, absolutely in it for the money and no matter how much they who are the principal share holders in the likes of Google and Amazon and Salesforce have, that’s no reason not to raise the price and make more in their competition to be the richest on the planet and have the showiest campus.

48,1401309666,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1836306-isk,3,"Review:Summary:The Internet has ended the economics of scarcity by cheaply enabling the distribution and acquisition of niche items.Example:Read:The Wired article, and then just Chapter 15: The long tail of marketing from this book.Improvements:Wish Anderson talked about differentiating between long tail-industries and non-long tail-industries, and how to boost long tails when there should be one but there isn't. Also, what a world would be like in which everything is long tail.Notes:Introduction - Our society is still obsessed with hits, but not as much anymore. For example, most of the top 50 all-time best-selling albums are from the 80s and 90s. Think about how different society today is from society twenty years ago -- back then, everybody watched the same handful of TV channels, listened to the same three radio stations, and read the same two newspapers.The long tail: How technology is turning mass markets into millions of niches - Physical retailers can only carry content when there's enough local demand. So while across the United States millions of people in total would watch Bollywood films in the theater if they could, in each individual city, there is not enough interest to justify putting a Bollywood film on the screen. Similarly, there is only so much radio spectrum and coaxial cable, to carry a limited number of radio stations and TV channels. This is the economics of scarcity; with online distribution and retail making 'shelf space' free, we have the economics of abundance. The average B&N carries about 100k titles; more than 25% of Amazon's sales come from outside its top 100k titles.The rise and fall of the hit: Lockstep culture is the exception, not the rule - Enter the niche.A short history of the long tail: From the wish book to the virtual shopping cart - The long tail has even been applied to warfare: traditionally, only nation-states have been able to affect society through warfare; but now, easy access and production of war tools allows for potent gangs (niches).The three forces of the long tail: Make it, get it out there, and help me find it - The number of niche products is so large that in aggregate they can compete with the hits. The long tail is culture without scarcity; that is, the long tail can only arise if the cost of accessing niches is negligible. Three ways to bring about zero-cost niches are 1) to make it easy for anyone to produce (e.g., the computer allows anyone to make a video or music), 2) to make it easy to receive (e.g., Youtube allows for easy access to videos), and 3) to connect supply and demand by helping consumers find the Tail items they want.The new producers: Never underestimate the power of a million amateurs with keys to the factory - Amateur astronomers can make discoveries, too. In this age we have changed from being passive consumers to active producers. Think of Wikipedia. Self-publishing is more a way to advertise yourself and distribute your message than a way to make money.The new markets: How to create an aggregator that can stretch from head to tail - Lower the costs of selling. Amazon is a hybrid physical-digital retailer, and as such, can not fully take advantage of the long tail yet.The new tastemakers: The ants have megaphones. What are they saying? - ""We are leaving the Information Age and entering the Recommendation Age."" Tastemakers -- people who influence behavior and encourage trying out new things -- are key. Use filters to move people from the safe hits they know to the world of niches they do not, in a personalized route. You need rankings within genres, not across. The long tail is both full of crap and brilliance. A hit is a black swan. Whatever you are looking for, the further down the long tail you go, the more stuff that you are not looking for appears.Long tail economics: Scarcity, abundance, and the death of the 80-20 rule - Should prices rise or go down further down the tail? It depends on whether you are in a 'want' or 'need' market: in need markets you can raise the price, and in want markets you should lower it (to encourage people to try something new).The short head: The world the shelf created, for better or worse - Successful long tail aggregators need both hits and niches -- just think of mp3.com for what happens when you don't have the hits. Think of how much better you can target the consumer online -- rather than a can of tuna being in the canned food section, it can be in the, say, 'under $2' section.The paradise of choice: We are entering an era of unprecedented choice. And that's a good thing - Eh...Niche culture: What's it like to live in a long tail world?The Infinite screet: video after television - How might the economics of abundance change the ""half-hour"" part of TV shows?Beyond entertainment: How far can the niche revolution reach?Long tail rules: How to create a consumer paradise - 1) Make everything available and 2) help me find it. Instead of predicting (pre-filtering), measure and respond (post-filter, e.g., by collaborative filtering).The long tail of marketing: How to sell where ""selling"" doesn't work - The best way to market to long tail consumers is to market to the people that these consumers listen to.Coda: Tomorrow's tailEpilogue"

In addition, the book is about technology so it is dated--and thus the end can be left unread."
271,1401309666,http://goodreads.com/user/show/78084705-ahmad-al-sofyani,3,"I liked how Chris predicted the future market before 10 years, however you would find the concept and writing a bit outdated considering the internet era we are in today. Moreover, the structure of the book is a bit confusing with some concepts are repeated over and over."
272,1401309666,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85286094-bart-van-bos,4,"Must read on the importance of the long tail and niche markets: democratisation of production tools, lower cost of distribution and connecting supply and demand through smart filters and recommendations."
273,1401309666,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20356170-thomas-warger,5,"The side of retail we never read about in the business press, which is enthralled with the perpetual quest for spikes--quick kills. The model Anderson explores comes from the world of bookselling, which makes this all the more compelling to read, for me."
274,1401309666,http://goodreads.com/user/show/98035847-edson-m-chilala,4,"A very good read. Core message: In markets where there's infinite capacity (especially in light of the internet which has cut costs and inventory ), the best strategy is to offer it all (extending the tail - distribution even farther to tap niches and untapped markets)."
275,1401309666,http://goodreads.com/user/show/106312540-the-seo-game-plan,5,A must read for professional internet marketers- especially people working in search marketing. This will get you away from the keyword hunt and into valuable strategies that actually help your clients.
276,1401309666,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30542444-dung,2,"2.5⭐️Although this book has good information, it was very repetitive and could not contain my interest. Could not find myself to continue reading beyond 40%. Maybe I’ll attempt it again in the future. "
277,1401309666,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56329745-taylor-lewin,4,Reading this in 2020 is a fun flashback with lots of mentions to MySpace and an a “new” company called YouTube. The principles still hold true and a great introduction of why things work on the internet.
278,1401309666,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22009695-sara-shabana,3,"Interesting book, yet could have been summarized in half the volume!"
279,1401309666,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33510720-bettina-g-may,2,Interesting book for retailers 20 years ago but events have overtaken it.
280,1401309666,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30713071-allan-laal,4,relevant even today in the sense of Freemium and micropricing being the reality today
281,1401309666,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69181120-lmcao,4,"At the internet age, the majority is no longer dominate the market, the minority can also find their favorites. "
282,1401309666,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47040540-josh-allred,5,I really enjoyed this book. Anderson's theory is even more important to understand today than ever before.
283,1401309666,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57917035-xuankang-lin,4,read it in my freshman year..
284,1401309666,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2971825-jeff-christiansen,3,"A bit dated as it’s 10 years old, however it seems his conclusions were on target."
285,1401309666,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20233370-ghassan-samaha,4,"If you target audience everywhere you will look for audience in the nowhere, a big window of HOPE for the ones who appreciate the new abundance economics."
286,1401309666,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76965839-mauricel,1,The most redundant book I have ever read. It was not a great read.
287,1401309666,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23075066-matthias,3,A pretty good read with interesting observations and valid conclusions. The potential of abundance and close to zero storage and delivery costs seems real. 
288,1401309666,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27405656-skuldintape,3,Stopped 100 pages before the end - it's well written but very much a book of it's time. The examples discussed are still valid but it's just not revelatory anymore.
289,1401309666,http://goodreads.com/user/show/82736672-ahmed-maher,3,It could have been shorter and yet get the same information without getting bored.
290,1401309666,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35607451-goutam-hebbar,5,Note: Read as summary.
291,1401309666,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85755189-todd-benschneider,5,Great concept to understand how eCommerce is revolutionizing the economy
292,1401309666,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31243625-yiannis-koutros,4,The book behind Amazon's business model
293,1401309666,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63676071-sabrina-coletta,1,Chris Anderson clearly couldn't say more using less... This book could have been resumed in 20 pages instead of 256 pages.
294,1401309666,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10422861-shahrukh,3,"The books can be summarized in couple of pages. If one read first two chapters and last one, it should be fine."
295,1401309666,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9533949-kimball,4,*I will update my review and shelves later.*
296,1401309666,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48347023-david-fredh,5,"A bit too long, but really good point. The new 80/20 rule? "
297,1401309666,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40731421-zaque-eyn,5,Must read and mostly because it is still very relevant to today’s economy.
298,1401309666,http://goodreads.com/user/show/89864181-mina,5,Better experience as a book than audio. Well written
299,1401309666,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63375030-tom-clarke,3,"An interesting premise with accurate predictions (made in 2006), but the book could have been half the length and just as effective."
