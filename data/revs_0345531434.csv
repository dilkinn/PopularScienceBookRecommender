0,0345531434,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16212136-peter-pete-mcloughlin,4," I can't help that the title of the book ""trespassing on Einstein's lawn"" is a metaphysical jibe at realism. The author is fascinated at that boundary where physics and metaphysics (in philosophy not new age) and is trespassing on Einstein's realism (god's eye view of the universe in relativity). The book has a lot to say about the frontiers of physics and goes into an exploration of the metaphysical implications as well. We go on a guided tour told through a first person memoir of modern physics and cosmology. We will learn about Dark Energy, De Sitter space, the Accelerating Universe, Black Hole physics, Quantum mechanics, inflationary cosmology, Multiverses and much more. The author goes on a personal journey as a science writer and learns from very recent debates about that the metaphysical picture of realism which has often be sparring with results from quantum mechanics may have to be discarded for a radical idea that reality is strongly observer dependent. She makes a good case for this perspective. She claims that the picture at the frontiers of cosmology may force us to break the glass of the perfect god's eye view of nature and say that the laws of physics depend on an observer. This is a model where the observer participates in the laws of nature. this point of view has been expressed since the beginnings of quantum theory in the early twentieth century but cosmology may be pointing to observer dependent reality. I like the author and I like her book but I recoil from her conclusion. I can't find it in me to believe how I look at the universe fundamentally changes the universe or affects reality. I heavily lean towards a realist position. Her book is great I like the personal style of memoir she made as a format. The science she covers seems right but as I said I don't like her metaphysical conclusion but it is definitely worth the time spent reading it."

I say surprisingly because I wouldn’t generally expect quantum mechanics, quarks, boson particles, string theory and the like to hold me hostage for an entire weekend of reading but I couldn’t put this book down! I’m no physicist (not even remotely) but I found the book to be accessible and clear. I have always been interested in the topic but I had never found a text that I could understand, relate to and enjoy, like this one. The memoir format worked well to create a personalized structure within which the (potentially) dry facts could be housed. The main character’s relationship with her parents, and her father in particular, was very heart-warming. I learned a lot from this book and it was refreshing to engage with a text that sparked my brain cells into some real thinking!"
2,0345531434,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4985353-matt-kimball,5,"Trespassing on Einstein's Lawn is a braid of three strands of narrative -- one part conceptual tour of modern physics, one part philosophical rumination on the metaphysical implications of the pure weirdness that is modern physics, and one part memoir and love-letter to the author's father, with all three modes compelling throughout. Gefter's journey starts in a Chinese restaurant at the age of fifteen, as her father asks her, ""How would you define nothing?"" Not content to keep the discussion small, Amanda and her father wonder what it really would mean if the Universe were filled with nothingness -- a completely homogeneous state in which the things we think of as something (Matter? Spacetime? Quarks? Strings?) aren't, or perhaps cease to be meaningful concepts when in a boundaryless soup of blended Universe. Could this homogeneous state, the ""H-State"", be some sort of clue to the origin of existence?From this seed, Amanda's journey begins. Early on, she poses as a journalist at a physics conference, simply to get access to the best minds in physics so they might answer a few questions about the mechanisms of how something could come from nothing. Later, her charades become reality as she is hired to write physics coverage for New Scientist magazine. In each stage of her journey, she interweaves the principles of modern physics with her own life story. Early on, she explains special and general relativity, followed by Thomas Young's mind-bending double-slit light experiment. A few chapters further, she contrasts the philosophical concept of scientific realism with its competing philosophies while in the same chapter narrating her battle unseen rats -- rats which may or may not exist -- in her tiny London flat. And later, we get deep into modern physics with Hawking radiation, the difference in perspective between an observer crossing the event horizon of a black hole with one stationed safely outside the event horizon, d-brane theory and the holographic principle, all raising new and more disturbing questions about what reality is, exactly.It's an exhilarating ride, and though it's deeply rooted in science, one might even call it a spiritual journey. Certainly some of the biggest questions about life, the universe, and the meaning of it all are raised, and very speculatively and tentatively suggested to have answers. For this reader, it was even a little comforting to work through it all. I've been saddened by the idea of the entropy death of the universe ever since I learned of the concept, even though the timescale for such an event is so remote as to be comically irrelevant to my life, and I've been deeply troubled by some interpretations of quantum mechanics which seem to imply a special role for consciousness in physics, and I was actually assuaged and had my mood lifted by Gefter's vision here in relation to both of these concepts, going into my exact reasoning here would be mild spoilers, so I'll avoid them and let other readers experience the journey on their own.I'd unreservedly recommend Gefter's book to folks with an interest in modern physics and a bit of a bent towards philosophy. As one of the many physicists mentioned in the book suggests, perhaps philosophy is too important to be left only to the philosophers."
3,0345531434,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12981120-jon-schull,5,"Really a wonderful book on many levels. Wonderful writing, wonderful people, wonderful wonder, and (apparently) a wonderful universe.I wrote her a fan letter, which I almost never do....Dear Ms Gefter,Congratulations on your book. I enjoyed and admired it tremendously and look forward to the next volume of what I hope will be a continuing saga. Your work is not done! Although I now work on human computer interaction in Rochester, NY, I taught Introductory and Biological Psychology at Haverford College from 1980-1992, I frequently visit family there, and of course the Hunan restaurant is a long time favorite. It so happens that in those days, I wrote my only other fan-letter to an author; I suggested to Freeman Dyson that the problem of unknowable other universes was similar to the problem of other minds. You're in good company in my book!Needless to say, I didn't understand much of what you discuss, but I do have a few questions / comments that might be useful. I realize that these may be coals to Newcastle, so I'll be brief. But I'd be happy to discuss further if they are useful to you. Am I correct that the zen-like summary of your story is that ""the only observer-independent invariant is that there is no observer-independent invariant""? If so, the paradox might be telling us something. What kind of gauge theory could reconcile the horns of that dilemma?Are you familiar with Gregory Bateson and his discussions of information theory? If not, I think you will enjoy Steps to an Ecology of Mind, especially the metalogues, and the Korzybski lecture. Here's my own gloss on the Korzybski lecture, to try to make the relevance to your work clear. (It's been about 20 years since I pondered the original text, so forgive any inaccuracies you may find when you get back to the orginal source.) Korzybski is famous for his observation that ""the map is not the territory"", and that maps (and maps of maps) are the only ""things"" we can know. Bateson (who participated in the Macy conferences that gave birth to information theory and systems theory) is famous for talking about information as ""a difference that makes a difference"". He points out that bits (and patterns which are collections of differences) are dimensionless non-things that nonetheless can capture observations of differences in the territory. When those differences are organized into patterns, they become maps (which preserve relationships in the territory, but should not be confused with the territory, in part because many different maps can be made of the same ultimately unknowable territory).  Implicit in Bateson's writing (I think) but never articulated, is this further extrapolation. The difference a difference makes is dependent on the position of the observer. A red light means ""stop"" at an intersection, but means something else in th red light district. Patterns--the differences made, the maps we perceive--are in the eye of the beholder. There is a theory of meaning in there. And thanks to your book, I realize there might be a theory of cosmology in there somewhere too. (Or a pony.)The other book I want to make sure you're familiar with is the Laws of Form by G. Spencer Brown. Maddeningly cryptic at times, it is all about logical divisions and how they spawn a universe of meaning (or structure, or something), which always collapses into true or false. It might be worth revisiting with quantum logic, which I do not pretend to understand. Finally, I thought you might enjoy seeing how the computer language Python deals with a few of the fundamentals you discuss.  In python a simple data structure is a list, denoted by two closed brackets: e.g., [1,2,3] # This is a comment  # Here is an empty list emptyList = [] # a single equal = assigns a value  # The length of an empty list is 0 len([]) == 0  #True #a double equal == assesses equality: thus, is the length of [ ] equal to 0?   # But the empty set is not nothing. It's greater than False and it's greater than True and its greater than any mere number False < True < 100 < [] #True  # And you can indeed build up numbers and ordinality from them  len( [[]] ) == 1 #True  len([ [], [] ] ) ==2 #True  [ [], [], [] ] > [ [], [] ] #TrueThanks again to you and your father for creating such wonderful and human work. "
4,0345531434,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8507674-jan,5,"Amanda Gefter is cute, charming, and whip smart. Provoked by her father's question about ""Nothing"" at age 15, she went on, through massive amounts of private reading in physics, philosophy, and cosmology, to become an amazing science journalist. This book tells the story of that journey. I needed the glossary at the end of the book. The definitions are written in a concise, accessible fashion, so it really did help me understand the theories she explored over the years. Even with the glossary handy, I needed the other recent readings I've done on the topics she covers in order to obliquely grasp the discussion. So, can a person read it just for the story of Gefter's journey? Probably not, but I can tell you all that physics and philosophy goes down a whole lot easier when embedded in the story of a young girl's quirky journey to an unlikely career outcome. Without a doubt this woman is smart, but she is also a great example of becoming brilliant by diligently pursuing knowledge and understanding. I reserve my five-star ratings for books I will press upon my friends, insisting they MUST read this. I am pressing this on my husband so he can talk about it with me. I think I will also press it on my son. But I doubt I'd strengthen bonds by pressing it on many others. So, an ""advised"" five stars. "
5,0345531434,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17005850-james-easterson,5,"One of the best books I've read in quite awhile. This book takes you down the rabbit-hole of cosmology and theoretical physics via the trippy world of quantum mechanics. First of all I'll say that I am not convinced of all the conclusions here but I accept it as a valid argument and my differences lay mostly due to my own biases and philosophies which I see no reason to abandon at this point. Secondly I will state the this book covers the all current theories exceedingly well and provided a description of them I have found no where else and has greatly improved my understanding of them. For the most part I kept up with this book fairly well, though it did get beyond me at points due to terminologies and some theories on physics. The author does an amazing job, and her story captivates! I could not recommend this book more highly! An awesome read! No, I don't accept it all, but so what. That's just me. Personally, I think ultimate reality is a bit deeper than physics alone and think that each observer is just part of a greater whole, rather than the whole is each observer dependent."
6,0345531434,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2457670-jen-jen,5,"Wow !!! I'm so impressed with this book. I came to it for a little info on John Wheeler, and I found that and so much more. Anyone concerned with the nature of reality and interested in the physics behind the search would enjoy this."
7,0345531434,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6857430-elnur-filbala,5,"What is ultimately real? — Amanda Gefter asks in her book and offers the answer: only what is invariant in any frame of reference is ultimately real. She composes the list of possible invariants, among them particles, fundamental forces, spacetime, and even the universe itself. During her quest for the ultimate reality she crosses every one of them out of the list.I have to say that I found this book fascinating. Its ideas of radical observer-dependency — that nothing is invariant and ultimately real — deeply resonated both with my worldview as well as with ideas and sources I’ve been coming across.The only thing that confused me is that the author considers herself an ontic structural realist. Does this mean that she believes in some invariant, observer-independent structure out there? In that case we end up with realism: the world is external and fixed, has certain inherent structure, which we discover via experiment and math, describe with theories which can succeed each other, but nevertheless are asymptotically more and more accurate descriptions of the world as it is. In her book, Gefter refers to the ideas of eminent physicist John Archibald Wheeler, but I don’t think he shared this vision. After all, when all invariants are gone, is the structure what is to stay? In absence of space, time and even the universe, the structure of what? Isn’t a structure, being part of the reality, meant to be a result of the interaction between an observer and the world?I’m wondering whether the author encountered the matter of metaphor in her studies. Having a degree in Philosophy of Science, Gefter is probably aware of growing recognition of metaphor’s role in reasoning. Metaphor is not just a figure of speech anymore, not mere ornament of language, but a cornerstone of human cognition that defines how we think, act and communicate. All our abstract concepts, including the most fundamental physical ones, have been shown to be metaphorical. Theodore L. Brown in his book “Making Truth: Metaphor in Science” clearly illustrates how progress in science is largely a succession of metaphors. In “Physics as Metaphor,” Roger S. Jones shows space, time, matter and number to be the “cardinal metaphors” of physics, the very glue that holds it all together.Yes, of course, ontic structural realist could say, but metaphors are just stories, our ways of understanding the world. Stories are different descriptions of reality and shouldn’t be mistaken for different realities. Stories can change, but the underlying reality, its mathematical structure always remains the same. The philosopher and conceptual metaphors theorist Mark Johnson would argue: “It is often said that mature theories will use only mathematics and formal logic, thereby supposedly transcending metaphor. But both logic and mathematics are based on large numbers of conceptual metaphors that define their most fundamental concepts and operations. Mathematizing science doesn’t eliminate metaphor.” “Where Mathematics Comes From” is a comprehensive illustration of mathematics’ metaphorical foundations.There is a large and growing evidence of metaphor’s constitutive role in philosophical and scientific thinking. There are voices calling for the view that all knowledge is metaphorical. More radically still, some thinkers, including famous scientist Gregory Bateson, give metaphor not only epistemological, but also ontological status, viewing it as a feature of both human mind and nature itself. The most recent and quite remarkable example of such approach to metaphor is an ambitious and thought-provoking book “Missing Link: The Evolution of Metaphor and the Metaphor of Evolution” by Canadian poet and critic Jeffery Donaldson.But probably the most original ideas in this camp belong to the philosopher Cathy J. Wheeler. In the short article “Question With No Answer, Or: Reality as Literalism and as Metaphor” she offers her vision: reality is what the universe appears to be through its sensitivities (by which she presumably means observer-participators). “The thoughts, experiences, and images that take shape within them are reality itself.”It’s strikingly similar to notions of genesis by observership and participatory universe — the core ideas of what I believe was John Wheeler’s vision. This is probably some kind of synchronicity, as Cathy Wheeler and her famous namesake are not related in any way.Similar ideas can be found in other authors. Among them: Schrödinger’s “The world is given to me only once, not one existing and one perceived. Subject and object are only one;” Skolimowski’s “Outer walls of the cosmos are the inner walls of the mind;” and the concluding thought of Gefter’s book: “Existence is what nothing looks like from the inside.”There is one crucial thing, however, that makes Cathy Wheeler’s approach different — metaphor. Being a circular relationship between the universe and its sensitivities, reality, according to her, is itself metaphorical: “Metaphor is no longer a contained and unreal product of human minds, but an act of the universe itself, bringing together things that have never before mingled or producing new juxtapositions and interactions among old companions. This sort of metaphor results in reality, not unreality. Any thought or image that takes form within a sensitivity is reality, whether this particular sense of reality lasts for a millisecond or a billion years, whether it occurs within one sensitivity or many.”Thus, for Cathy Wheeler, metaphor is not a way of the separated mind to understand independent, single reality. As the line between observer and observed is blurring, reality and our perception of it become one and the same. Metaphor then is a way how various aspects of the universe interact, manifesting as definite reality. “Reality as metaphor is multiple and mutable. The universe keeps coming together in different configurations, each one producing a sense of reality ‘as if’ this is how the world is.”The universe was a machine yesterday, it’s the Big Bang expansion today, it may be a hologram or information tomorrow. Or a simulation, maybe. But whatever it is, we should remember that, as Norman O. Brown said, “all that is, is metaphor.” No matter whether in epistemological or ontological sense.There can be no theory of everything. No final destination from where we can say: “This is how the world really is.” Cathy Wheeler put it better than I could: “All reality is metaphorical […]. The universe takes form ‘as if’ there are certain things that do not ‘really’ exist, or that are [appearances] of other things, or that are mistakes, as well as ‘as if’ certain things are simply how things are.”Of course, taking reality as metaphor is a metaphor itself. A strange loop. We never get beyond metaphor. We never get to ultimate reality. We never get outside. What we call “outside” is another part of “inside” (and both, we must not forget, are metaphors, a consequence of our understanding of space, our very being in the world). Like Ouroboros biting its own tail, we can’t escape Gödel’s spell. We shouldn’t. Instead, we can celebrate metaphor as the universe “realizing” itself — coming into existence as being some, but not the only way — through us. M is for metaphor?"
8,0345531434,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5469227-d-l-morrese,5,"What is real? Really real? Real for everyone everywhere? This is essentially the philosophical question Amanda Gefter is exploring in this truly unique book. It's part memoir, part philosophy, and part science. It's a narration of her personal quest to find an answer to the ultimate question of life, the universe, and everything. It's a story about how she finagles a job as a science journalist in order to talk to some of the most eminent people working in theoretical physics today, and it's an exploration of the metaphysical implications of some of their ideas. (Reviewers note to reader: Metaphysics is the branch of philosophy that deals with the ultimate nature of reality. It's kind of like real physics, especially theoretical physics, but without all the messy math and testability requirements.)I write (soft) science fiction, but I'm not a scientist. Relativity seemed rational enough to me (after some mental gymnastics), but many of the implications of quantum mechanics boggled my mind. It could make accurate predictions, but it never really made sense. It was like a superposition of 'true' and 'bat-crap crazy'. After joining Amanda on her search in the pages of this book, I feel I have a better intuitive grasp of entanglement, wave-particle duality, the uncertainty principle, and entropy than those I possessed before. My shaky understanding may still be dead wrong, of course, but at least I have some framework to give these ideas structure now.This would have been enough for me to proclaim this a great science book for nonscientists. But it has more.She shows us some of the major physicists of our time not as embodiments of their ideas but as real people who interact with the world around them much as we of lesser intellect do. They have personalities, egos, disagreements, and quirks. They are real people who also just happen to be brilliant scientists. As she related her interviews with them, I thought about young students who might be reading this and drawing inspiration from it. We sometimes put great achievers on pedestals, implying that greatness is out of reach for us 'normal' people. Gefter brings them down to earth, showing us their humanity and thereby reminding us that they are not so different from the rest of us.I think this book also reminds us of the tenuous relationship between theory, experiment, and the 'reality' behind them. Experiments yield data and theories provide beautiful equations, but what are they telling us about the underlying reality (assuming there is some)? This seems largely open to interpretation, at least on the quantum level. Yeah, the math works, but what does it MEAN? Is the 'thing' found 'real' or is it just a data point that tells us about a relationship with other data points from a particular point of view? Apparently, the answers depend on the questions asked, and if those answers seem contradictory, it may be because some of our underlying assumptions are wrong.Some books about science suggest that scientists are simply fine tuning, adding details to the standard model, and working out a few remaining unknowns, such as the nature of dark energy or whatever. Trespassing on Einstein's Lawn, I think, is telling us something entirely different. There are still a great number of things to learn and new theories needed to make sense of them. Science is not almost done. It has barely begun. There remains much to discover and understand.I found this book informative, thought provoking, and entertaining. I highly recommend it to anyone interested in science and philosophy."
9,0345531434,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18829090-malli,2,"A book that started out with a great deal of hope but petered out in disappointing fashion for me. Amanda Gefter seemed like an approachable, science enthusiast desperate to learn the theory of universe creation. The books starts off well - her father's and her love for physics shines through and the first couple of chapters are charming, endearing and lucid. But after that, she loses the plot. Her writing gets turgid and at times condescending (her frequent references to her dad, mom and labrador do nothing to the plot other than providing brief respite from her poor prose). I am a determined reader when it comes to technical stuff related to cosmology - but I found her style arcane and poor. Would recommend a miss. There is better stuff out there. "
10,0345531434,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54802279-kay-chandler,4,"I both really enjoyed reading this book and found it difficult to read in parts. The ideas are so interesting to explore and the author does a very good job of explaining how she approaches the ideas and connects them to other ideas through the search she and her father undertake to understand what is real. It is a difficult concept for me to wrap my head around and some of the in depth physics discussions lost me. But I enjoyed trying to understand and it was one of those books that I often thought about even when I wasn’t reading it. The things that most stick with me are having curiosity, wondering about the world and how we see it, and meaningfulness of relationships to share our experiences as a way of making sense of life."
11,0345531434,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67063925-mary-t,5,I love this book! 
12,0345531434,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5968766-gabe,5,A memoir about nothing and physics at the same timeI liked this book because it earnestly tried to explain advanced physics and the state of the art while posing as a memoir / quest of discovery. Masterfully done.
13,0345531434,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1971718-b-rule,4,"The framing of this book is fantastic. Fittingly, Gefter writes not from the objective, god's eye perspective of most physics books, but instead has written this as a memoir of personal intellectual exploration. She chronicles her lifelong quest for knowledge of ultimate reality, starting with a conversation with her father about nothingness in a Chinese restaurant at age 15. The story of their relationship as partners in crime to discover the riddle of existence is beautiful, inspiring, and wonderfully heartwarming. Her dad sounds amazing. Gefter does a pretty good job of walking the reader through some of the most complex concepts of modern physics, and her irreverent, slightly punky tone is a refreshing approach. That said, she is a bit of a wild-eyed guide, and at times, I lost the thread as her excitement overwhelms her clarity. Nonetheless, that passion is a lot of fun to read. I found myself ultimately more sympathetic to the Zen and intellectual hunger of her father, and she pays him tribute more than any parent could ever hope for.The ultimate conclusions of their quest are essentially the radical observer-dependence of reality (i.e., the failure of any invariant or absolute objective perspective to accurately and completely describe the universe), and that all this ""something"" is really still nothing (what they cutely call the H-state: an infinitely homogeneous state) considered from within a bounded, observer frame of reference. Her end position, that of one universe for every observer, each a solipsistic whole unto itself with no possibility of a unifying outside perspective encompassing and stitching them all together, is both fascinating and horrifying from a metaphysical perspective. My problem with these answers is that Gefter doesn't do much beyond that to question ""why is reality so seemingly observer-dependent? Why does the qualia of existence seem so much like there is something to the universe?"" One of the reasons I ended up wishing to spend more time with her father is that he seemed to ponder those questions a little more slowly and reflectively, while Amanda's perspective is a manic, mad dash for The Answer. Warren seemed like he was approaching the question of existence from a point of existential need, while Amanda is more goal-oriented. Overall though, a very unusual and interesting science book and one that gives a much different flavor than the usual proceedings. If nothing else, the inspiration of their father-daughter relationship will stay with me a long time."
14,0345531434,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17085355-michael-taouk,5,"Let's face it, physicists, in general, tend to be aloof. You and I rarely understand the inner workings of the sanctuary. The high priests see no reason to bother with the ignorant masses. With a rare and powerful mixture of modesty, confidence and charm, Amanda Gefter bridges the divide. The beauty and wonder of the sanctuary together with its dark secrets are left bare for all to see. “Trespassing on Einstein’s Lawn” is investigative journalism at its best.Gefter, narrating a story in the first person, begins with cashew chicken and a basic question posed by her father: “What is nothing?” She defines “reality” as that which does not change depending on the frame of reference from which it is observed. - “If you can find one frame of reference in which the thing disappears, then it’s not invariant, its observer-dependent”. She then sets out exploring theoretical physics in search of one measurable thing that is “real”. She takes us with her on an adventure encompassing everything, from the smallest dimensions of quantum mechanics to the nature of the universe as a whole. Gefter reveals two fundamental limitations in science. The first is the folly of our attempt to view the universe from the outside, when there is no outside. The second is the mind's inability to comprehend itself - similar to Godel's incompleteness theorem. Avoiding these two errors eliminates a myriad of paradoxes that plague Quantum Mechanics and General Relativity. In their zeal for an objective reality, the greatest minds, including Einstein and Bohr repeatedly fall into the trap. Thank you, Amanda. My beautiful, objective, secure and cozy scientific world is shattered, revealing an even greater beauty! I will be reading this book again and again. "

As someone who is obsessed with physics (and quantum physics in particular), this book is a must have, and one that will be re-read over and over as new quantum physics discoveries happen.Her relationship with her father, who is the reason she embarked on this journey to begin with, brought me to tears.

It's a great example of parents encouraging a child's interest in science. Especially because girls are so often discouraged from expressing an interest in science2. It's a wonderful story of a father/daughter relationship.3. It's all about the cutting edge of physics and the scientists involved in it, explained in clear, plain language.4. Physics as philosophy - the subtitle is ""the meaning of nothing and the beginning of everything.""5.

It is often hard for people who are not typically science inclined to follow discussions of physics, and worse, if we are interested, it is hard to figure out where to start in learning the theories. This book sidestepped that issue by using her personal narrative to progress the reader's understanding of physics in the same manner that she learned it. Plus, the story she tells is incredibly interesting and well written. I would absolutely pick up another book written by her. Recommended for people interested in physics, but who have been intimidated by trying to learn it. "
18,0345531434,http://goodreads.com/user/show/249339-carl,4,"Amanda Gefter is amazingly clever, there’s no doubt about that. So it’s hard to take completely seriously her “aw-shucks-I’m-just-a-humanities girl/science was never my bag” routine that she uses to weave her narrative around. But it’s a thrilling narrative and it gets to the heart of some of the biggest questions of existence so I’ll forgive a little false modesty. Especially since she comes across as so goddamn impressively plucky and writes in an engaging and disarming (given the complexity of the topic) manner. If you’re interested in physics: highly recommended. But be very suspicious of anyone who claims to have really understood it. "

Amanda Gefter has a real knack for explaining physics without oversimplifying. That said, I could still smell smoke coming out of my ears from trying to get a handle on some of these concepts. The book is an engaging read. Part memoir and part scientific textbook, this book tells the story of Amanda and her father's initial interest in physics and the lengths they ultimately go to to pursue their interest.

21,0345531434,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3454378-c,5,"An excellent and engrossing description of the latest developments in cosmology. The final chapter is more than a bit speculative, but few other books about this subject come close to being this readable and entertaining."
22,0345531434,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3637454-brandon,4,"I really enjoyed the hybrid of a memoir with cosmology (a word I learned from this book) and specks of philosophy. Gefter's ability to become part of the search for ultimate reality based primarily on her desire to do so was interesting and instructive. Her voice was so strong in the writing that most of the time I felt that I too was on the journey, discovery bit by bit the observer-dependent nature of the universe. It was a fascinating read and by the end I was surprised to gain a similar admiration for the key players in our collective effort to better understand the universe.A few criticisms though: (1) The language was regularly and routinely profane. I realize that Gefter was trying to express her true voice, but it was jarring to read such an otherwise intellectual book laced with profanity. (2) The third quarter of the book dragged. The law of diminishing returns naturally would apply to a search like this, but could have been sped up or condensed. There was so little gained incrementally here that it was hard to get through. Of course, once the memoir idea finally cemented in Gefter's story, the conclusion flowed naturally and well. (3) The conclusion felt a bit anticlimatic. Perhaps it was because Gefter had given all of the conclusions along the way, or maybe it was a more fundamental disagreement that the conclusions should be considered fact (although they are certainly well-reasoned and interesting ideas). Still, the journey was worth it and I'd definitely be interested in a follow-up just to see what exciting adventures and discoveries Gefter has made since writing this."
23,0345531434,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2909303-madeleine,5,"I took 2 months (!) reading this book. I found that each chapter required a re-read before I moved on to the next. BUT IT WAS DELICIOUS!In almost every chapter Gefter is spoon feeding you a basic physics concept. But you have to stop and learn that approach as in the next chapter she'll tell you why that approach was dissatisfactory for her. Then you pause and teach yourself why that last chapter you'd ""learned"" was not quite right. Each chapter builds on the concepts in the previous so there's no just skipping something you didn't quite get because it will come back up.And so on and so on.I recognize that this makes it sound like a slog but it's the total opposite. This is one of the few times where I worked at keeping up with an author. It was fantastic and the composite curve resulted in me actually learning the information. How do I know? I read this book 3 years ago and just went to a bar trivia night that randomly had 3 physics questions. I got them all correct! My team was impressed and wondered how I knew so much. I wondered how I knew so much. And slowly, so slowly, I recalled that I'd read a book 3 years ago (!) about physics, hmmm . . . I recalled that the author was not classically trained, hmmmm . . . I recalled it was also a humanist story about her father . . . O! M! G! I suddenly remembered reading a book for 2 months and working for it. That knowledge stayed!But I'd enjoyed reading the book so much at the time I'm marking this as ""Must Read Again"". And I came onto GoodReads to write a review about a book that I'd read three damn years ago.That good!"

With a delightfully mysterious title, cover, and all.I'm a big fan of fantasy and adventure stories, so who would have thought a non-fiction book could become one of my most treasured volumes?My interest in quantum physics started when I read 'His Dark Materials' in high school and I found the story pulling at me more and more, especially when I learned even a tiny bit more about quantum physics. I have given copy after copy of this book away and keep buying myself new ones. I'm re-reading it again now, hence the review, and again I find myself so ridiculously excited about all the discoveries! Especially the ones that have happened since its publication that confirm things in the book. So fun!Anyway, do yourself a favor and read this. Amanda Gefter's narrative makes quantum physics a secret rebellion, a daring plot, the mystery we want in our lives...and maybe a few answers...but we still have yet to see, don't we?"

I have already recommended or purchased this book for several friends and family members, and I’m sure I’ll do so many more times. This is the kind of book that if you’re reading it and someone asks how you’re doing, the answer is “great!” Really. It’s also a jumping-off point to learn about all sorts of concepts. I’d like to follow many of the threads the author introduces, then come back to read this book again someday. She has a gift for writing with lucidity and cheer about immensely complex scientific topics, and personal stories that provide the emotional frame of the book (about the author, her father, and their physics hero) are endearing. I would gladly read anything she writes, about physics or anything else. Learning hasn’t seemed like so much fun since I was a kid. Thanks, Amanda, for putting a spring in my step and reigniting the fire of curiosity in my mind!"

While reading about the debate between Gross and Susskind and then the existential panic Amanda went through trying to resolve the string issues it hit me that the answer might be in another book I was reading at the time; Life on the Edge, which deals with quantum biology. It turns out, according to that book, that biological systems resolve quantum probability at lower thresholds than other non-living systems. if that is the case would the Universe have ""collapsed"" into the state and physics we know because of the lower probability threshold? The dreaded ""A"" word might be the reason ""how"" if not for the expected ""Why""?"

The narrative starts out personal and with an honest and (perhaps) naive approach to some of the biggest questions in science (Why the quantum?, for example). I really enjoyed this - refreshing and original. Sure, there was an element of name dropping, but it worked. Perhaps inevitably, the story slows as the author learns more and gets established as a science writer. The narrative loses some of the freshness and - even though the ideas are still fairly well explained - I found it difficult to keep going. Still, overall I did enjoy it and would recommend it. "

34,0345531434,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31446821-daniel-danciu,5,This book is simply amazing. The talent of the author to explain some not-so-easy-to-grasp concepts from modern theoretical Physics is absolutely unparalleled to anything I've read before.

39,0345531434,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6016605-john,5,"I love Trespassing on Einstein's Lawn by Amanda Gefter more than I've loved any book in a long time.I first became fascinated by cosmology in third grade (no kidding, in third grade I wrote an essay for school titled, ""When I Grow Up I Want to Be a Cosmologist."" You can ask my mom—she still has it.) While I didn't dedicate my life to pursuing the subject the way that Ms. Gefter has, her delight and fascination with the theories of cosmology perfectly captures my own. I know the thrill of them the same way she does.More than any other, this book reminds me why I love this field of study.Most readers expect popular science books about cosmology to be written as fairly straight-forward informational texts. Ms. Gefter takes a very different approach here—she wrote this book as a personal memoir, the story of her path of discovery. It's a deft strategy which grants a deeply personal resonance to a subject that defines ""esoteric"".Trespassing on Einstein's Lawn is probably the best all-in-one summary of the cutting-edge ideas that have formed cosmology to date. Ms. Gefter explains each theory in layman's terms about as well as possible—an impressive feat, given that some of these theories can't really be stated in layman's terms at all. She draws lines of connection between these various ideas to show how they all relate to each other.It's impossible to explore any aspect of cosmology in depth without using the abstruse language of the subject to some degree. Given that I've been an avid amateur cosmological enthusiast since I was a boy, I'm already quite familiar with this specialized vocabulary. Therefore, I can't properly gauge how well readers new to the topic will be able to follow along. I feel that Ms. Gefter defines these specialist terms quite well, but it may be that this book isn't as layman-friendly as I think it is.It took me longer to read Trespassing on Einstein's Lawn than I anticipated, given my love for the subject matter and my previous familiarity with it. The reason it took me so long to get through it is because I had to stop every couple of pages to write things down—reactions, questions, disagreements, newly inspired thoughts. This book is dense with ideas, there's so much on every page to mull over and evaluate. I haven't had this many fresh thoughts about cosmology galloping around my head in a long time. I was compelled to take regular breaks to let my brain settle down and catch up.This book inspired me.If the book opens itself to criticism, it's because Ms. Gefter offers her own rather extreme interpretation of where the current cutting-edge of cosmology is taking us. It's worth noting that some of the best cosmologists in the field don't agree with her. It's also true that Ms. Gefter clearly prefers the ideas of some cosmologists over others (a statement which describes every professional cosmologist, as well, so she's in good company). But even if you don't agree with her conclusions, and even if she does display a degree of personal bias, her explanations of cosmology overall are very well done.You don't have to agree with any of the theories laid out in these pages to find joy in exploring them. There's tremendous delight in trying to wrap your mind around such mind-twisting ideas. Knowing that human beings are capable of conceiving such complex structures of thought is awe-inspiring.Ms. Gefter's excitement for cosmology is infectious. She's a wonderful tour guide through one of the most extreme and counter-intuitive subjects out there."
40,0345531434,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16309019-george-heidenrich,4,"I'm not quite sure how I feel about this book, because I was looking for more of a conclusion about reality than that it is observer-dependent. Is Reality Nothing (I.e., not objectively verifiable (measurable))? Intuitively, I guess I can live with that. I've believed for a long time that we each create our own reality. But somehow my reality should relate in some way to other people's reality. Making everything observer-dependent, as the author does, still leaves the question of ""How do we know what we know, and how do we know we can depend on it?"" unanswered.Ms. Gefter presents many factors that historically have had something to do with defining reality, either the Einstein view (relativity), or the quantum mechanical view (probability). It was definitely educational to see how many famous scientists have progressively evolved the problems and theories associated with how the universe works consistently. However, I found myself wishing I had made a diagram of the various notions and their logical agreements and difficulties. Many of the arguments come up over and over again, each time in a different context, and it was easy to become lost. The conclusion, while it was apparently an ""a-ha"" moment for the author, came too suddenly for me to feel satisfied.Still, I believe this is an important book for anyone looking to learn more about the current players and state of cosmology theory, and does not require a knowledge of mathematics to be understandable. I am concurrently reading several other books in cosmology, which has helped me understand this field as part science, part philosophy. Especially useful is ""The Infinity Puzzle"" by Frank Close, about which I have written elsewhere. Also see ""This Explains Everything"" edited by John Brockman, ""The Fabric of Reality"" by David Deutsch, ""The Big Picture"" by Sean Carroll, and ""Why Does The World Exist"" by Jim Holt."
41,0345531434,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19168860-scott,4,"To me, Trespassing on Einstein's Lawn is an extremely important work. The worlds of physics, cosmology, and even science in general, is opaque to most of us. We have no idea what is going on in science - what new discoveries are being made, why they're important, what questions they raise. That puts us at a distance from this quest for the truth, and it makes it difficult for us to trust scientists. Our most frequent contact with scientific work is when we hear about some ridiculous study, and we ask each other ""does someone really get paid for that?"" ToEL is a fascinating and illuminating exploration of physics, and the author, Amanda Gefter, actually tries to describe it for regular people! That is incredibly valuable, and I'm so thankful that Gefter produced this - I hope I can find many more works that help give a layman's guide to an expert's world. Still, ToEL isn't perfect - which I'll try to explain here.At its heart, ToEL is really a memoir written by Gefter. She tells the story of her journey to discover what the universe really is. One night, the teenaged Gefter was having dinner with her father when he asked question - ""what is nothing?"" The question seems simple, but as they talk it opens up a can of worms that the rest of the book explores. Despite never having interest in math or science in school, Gefter begins to research, with her father, theories on the origins and explanations of the universe. She starts a career as a science journalist and interviews many eminent physicists as her questions get more and more complicated. She learns a tremendous amount of avant grade theory, and takes the time to explain them in ways that someone rather slow - like me - could understand. Mostly. This is where my critique of this book begins - it gets very confusing, despite Gefter's best efforts. The theory gets very complicated, and, sometimes, I didn't really know what was going on. Gefter tries to go slow and explain things, but I felt that I needed more. More explanation, more examples, more pictures. However, I acknowledge that this may not be possible - the subject matter is so complicated, maybe it just can't be explained without extensive study. Still, it took away from my enjoyment and my learning. Further, I felt confused by the implications of a lot of the conclusions reached. As Gefter discovered that more and more of what we take to be reality was really observer dependent, I wanted to know what that might mean for any of us. Again, maybe that's something that's unexplainable - who really knows? I suppose that I also wanted a discussion of the philosophic repercussions, and while this was briefly covered, I wanted a lot more.Overall, ToEL is a very well-written book, but it gets quite convoluted. When finishing, I wondered ""what have I really learned from this?"" Still, I love that there is a book like this that tries to explain these concepts to regular folks, and I hope this inspires similar works, by Gefter (who really is a very good writer) and others."
42,0345531434,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1753018-paula-koneazny,4,"In her ""Note to the Reader,"" Amanda Gefter accurately presents her book as ""cutting-edge physics packaged in a personal memoir, which spans the last seventeen years of my life"" (more or less age 15-32). Her quest (shared with her father in an enviable father/daughter relationship)to define ""nothing"" leads her to get a degree in the Philosophy of Science (after which she self-describes herself as an ontic structural realist) & to become a bona fide science journalist on the staff of New Scientist. At times the quest to know makes the book a page turner, rather rare in a work of science journalism. At times, the book (both the science & the memoir) are overly repetitious, which is perhaps helpful to the reader where physics is concerned, not so interesting as it applies to the memoir (too much going on about the real or imagined rats in her London studio, for example; too frequent returning to the genesis of her intellectual adventure as well). As far as memoir is concerned, Gefter's is one in a very restricted sense: there is much included concerning her conversations with her father & her meet ups with eminent physicists & virtually nothing about any other aspects of her personal life (for example, in her acknowledgements, Gefter nods to 10 years of friendship & physics with a friend; however, these conversations do not enter the book): one would like some intimations of the author's social & personal life beyond reports of frequent visits to her parents. Ultimately, however, it is the physics (cosmology) which fascinates both author & reader. Where are we now? ""Reality is radically observer-dependent. Every possible ingredient of ultimate reality . . . has been crossed off. Nothing is invariant. Nothing is ultimately real."" Food for thought, for sure."
43,0345531434,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28204661-dan-falk,5,"This is physics with a twist: Instead of lecturing to us, Amanda Gefter takes us along on a very personal quest, as she undertakes a remarkable journey, meeting with leading physicists and struggling to make sense of the most difficult concepts in all of science. The best part is, we *do* learn quite a lot of physics along the way -- but we're having so much fun, we hardly notice that we're learning. Among the thinkers we get to know is John Wheeler, who coined the phrase ""black hole"" and who passed away a few years ago; Gefter digs into the archives containing his unpublished notes and letters. An even more important presence is Warren, the author's father; it was over a dinner in a favourite Chinese restaurant that he first asks her, ""How would you define 'nothing'?"" That was the beginning of this poignant father-and-daughter quest, and this book is the end result. Read it for the cutting-edge science; and read it for the humor, which shines on nearly every page. Highly recommended."
44,0345531434,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2125534-matthew-ciarvella,5,"I imagine that it's really hard to write a book on theoretical physics that's both entertaining and informative. You either fill the book with math, and thus ensure that only other PhDs will ever read it, or you write in heavy-handed metaphors that make your readers feel like you've written ""baby's first theoretical physics book.""Amanda Gefter manages to write an informative book on theoretical physics and the search for ultimate reality . . . and she tells a really interesting story along the way.It's as much a memoir as it is a book about the author's attempt to answer the ultimate philosophical question: what is real? Gefter's story of how she came to this question via her father and how she started down the path to trying to answer it are as interesting as the theories she grapples with. A great book and one that I can recommend for anyone with even a passing interest in the question ""what is ultimately real?"""
45,0345531434,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10887798-bryan,4,"This book made me think. I mean really think. Geftner is a wonderful teacher and I learned alot about the philosophy of physics. Did I agree with all her conclusions, no. Making everything radically-observer dependent seems too philosophically far-fetched for me. That being said, do I wish I could discuss this book with her in a one on one setting, definitely. She's so engaging that she could probably quell my doubts in about a half an hour (or maybe not).Anyway, the book is excellent. Sometimes I tired of her I'm just a small girl trying to make my way, the fact that I am reading this engaging book she wrote makes her an exceptional person. In fact, the whole memoir part of the book turned me off. I understand why she did it, it just didn't do it for me, so I had to deduct a star. Overall though, if you enjoy science books, don't pass this one up."
46,0345531434,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32051860-jessica,3,"A memoir that deals with a father and daughter's hunt through physics and philosophy for the answer to reality. Written by a science journalist, this book discusses incredibly complicated physics concepts in layman's language, with a sprinkling of unexpected irreverent humor. It's the kind of story that you would never believe was true--in terms of the journey itself as well as the landmarks and destination.It drags quite a bit in the middle, and this reader wonders why they didn't reach their conclusion sooner. The conclusion itself--their answer to ""life, the universe, and everything""--is more satisfying than ""42"", but not as satisfying as one would hope. The journey, however, makes this book a fascinating and fulfilling read."
47,0345531434,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8355028-kate,2,"This was like taking a class from a teacher you can't stand. The science was fun, and I admired how she invented herself, but the author's contempt for others was really off-putting. She does a lot of the insecure-cool-kid making mean jokes about other people as if you are in on it (you can be cool too!).I wasn't sure exactly what she was trying to do at one point - she tells us 42 is not a satisfying answer to life in the same chapter when she is discovering perhaps math is the answer to life. Was she being ironic? Does she not understand simple substitution cipher?My deepest question was wondering who she thinks is going to read her book since it's clear from her book that she thinks most of the world is too dumb and uncool to ever even want to understand it."

The book I d recommend to everyone to read, no matter if you are a science lover or not, because the book is simply amazing. And what is more important, Amanda shows clearly how easy it is for all of us to live our dreams and strongest desires in reality if we truly want what we wish for and are determined to make all of that come true. :) The strength of belief is a powerful source in life.

I just didn't enjoy it as much as I feel others would if they 'got' theoretical physics. "

For whatever reason, the bond they shared propelled me to finish a book that I otherwise might have given up on.And after all that, I enjoyed the book and came away knowing things about physics that I didn't know before."

I continued with the story curious about the father-daughter adventure & let the theoretical physics wash over me. Then something magical happened -- I started to understand the fundamental problems in all the theories & efforts to understand physics. It was amazing. Don't expect me to regurgitate the theories/problems presented but I had a glimmer of understanding that had always eluded me. It was a fun read & the author's enthusiasm was a big help. "

The author manages to combine a fine story of a father and daughter pursuing a common goal with a good overview of cutting edge quantum physics. Perhaps the most interesting conclusion for me was the fact that, in this universe, nothing at all happens...can happen....without the presence of ""observers"". Although the book itself is definitely not religious, it is not much of a stretch to reach some spiritual conclusions.  "

(As evidenced by the title of my review.)There are concepts, terminology and mathematics I may never 'get' but I got something else out of it--a peek into another human beings perspective of the universe.No matter how you cut it, that's cool."
57,0345531434,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4763049-holly,3,"While I enjoyed the author's autobiographical story and depiction of her relationship with her father, the expository writing on physics seemed oddly paced and geared toward mixed audiences (e.g., jumping from basic to highly complicated and back again, over and over). She lost this reader several times, so perhaps I only quibble because she didn't flatter my intelligence - make me feel smart - as other science writers do. "
58,0345531434,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43124849-jane-sherman,5,"Loved this book. More because it is the story of a young woman finding her own voice than for the physics and cosmology. I have to admit that most of the math and physics was way over my head. Still very worth reading. If you like math and science or you love reading books more for the layperson than the scientist, then I heartily recommend Gefner's book. How lucky she and her father were to have each other. "
59,0345531434,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6232534-joe,5,"Extremely well done, but not recommended for anyone who isn't big into physics and especially cosmology. There's not a single equation, but the very descriptive logic can be tough to follow if you don't have some background in this area. In any case, Amanda does a terrific job in describing the progress over the last 15 years or so in this someone esoteric field at the very forefront of quantum physics and the origins of the universe."
60,0345531434,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29700791-nikki,5,"This book was tough going for me at times, and there was a lot of physics information that I did not fully grasp. However, when I was able to finally understand a concept it was fascinating, paradigm shifting stuff. I also loved the way the information was presented, the author's journey from somewhat nihilistic teen to following her passion and then creating her own fulfilling reality. "
61,0345531434,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7227227-tori,4,"Admittedly, most of this book was over my head. But it was so well written, interesting the whole way through, and actually relatable. I was able to grasp the big things - variable vs. invariable, single vs. multiple observers, what is real. And now I know the essence of the universe: everything is nothing, and nothing is real. "
62,0345531434,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20671706-robb-wetmore,5,"I've read a number of books on astrophysics/cosmology but this was the most understandable. Through first person narrative the author explains her (and her father's) journey on the road to trying to find ultimate reality. It's amazing that a non-scientist, non-accredited first time writer was able to meet the greatest living minds in physics and synthesize such an approachable book. "
63,0345531434,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4504784-jim,4,"I liked the book despite the fact that I couldn't follow parts of it. I am not a physics nerd so many of the explanations were way over my head and too technical, but the parts I could understand were quite fascinating, as was the back story about her relationship with her father. Not a quick read by any means, but an introduction to the wild and mostly non-intuitive world of quantum physics."
64,0345531434,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43122553-masatoshi-nishimura,4,"Good book with lots of personal story about physicists. It was a little tough to follow some terms, coming from non science background. One thing I hoped she would have done was to lay out the basic terminology in the intro of each chapter. It would have been easier to follow her dialogue. Nonetheless, I did enjoy her journalist touch."
65,0345531434,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31844212-randy-smith,2,"I get lost in the physics concepts and theories, but love the challenge. A pleasant story, layman physics descriptions, and a lot of food for thought.Conversely I can't ignore two thoughts. 1) This book is about a daughters obsession with her father. 2) Her physics is a mental masturbation without an orgasm."
66,0345531434,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21664529-johan-boesveld,5,"One of the best readable books on physics for non-scientist I've ever read. From relativity to quantumfysics, about black holes, horizons and symmetry. Your perspective on what is real and what is not will change forever.I'm going to read it again to get a better understanding, after reading this I wanted more and already ordered new books on these topics."
67,0345531434,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10141818-dominic,4,"This is quite a good primer on the philosophical questions plaguing modern physics. It is equation free and shot throughout with the story of a young thinker and her father in a very satisfying way. The concepts are big and tangled and it gets bogged down for a while but in the end, I recommend it to anyone with an interest in the big bad universe."
68,0345531434,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24076520-john-parker,5,Wonderfully written by weaving her personal story and search for understanding with conversations with physicists and cosmologists. In addition she brings a creative synthesis and viewpoint to the fundamental questions which she poses--in the form of cosmic solipsism.Highly recommended.
69,0345531434,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9246862-seth,4,"A book about nothing, which is to say about life, the universe, and everything. Is there a real universe out there, or is it all omphaloskepsis? More questions than firms answers here, but oh what questions..."
70,0345531434,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5856948-brian,3,"An attempt to make cutting edge physics accessible to ""Joe Average"". Interesting and thought provoking but I personally need to wait until solutions to some of these questions are a little more developed."
71,0345531434,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18071176-philip,5,The author leads you through the process of understanding what's really going on in physics today and the conclusions are mind blowing in every sense. One of the best books i've read on this subject aimed at the rest of us. 
72,0345531434,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4770345-lexie-graham,0,"Overall this an interesting, well-written book. I just didn't feel like wading through the physics (nicely explained though) to get to the memoir part of the author's story, which to me was the more interesting part."
73,0345531434,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1483819-jennifer,3,"Kind of amazing how she got from point A to point B as a writer. I started skimming a lot of the theoretical physics part toward the middle of the book, it was too dense for me. I wish there was more about her relationship with her Dad."
74,0345531434,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37596888-jan-willem-de-vries,3,"Good but not perfect. She rambles a bit too much. Plus she acts like she is doing sneaky stuff. Writing about science while pretending to be a journalist. Well Amanda, I've got news for you; if you write about science and publish it you are a journalist. "
75,0345531434,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44543805-faye-sleeper,3,"You have to want to dive into Physics, fairly deeply, if you want to really enjoy the book. I skimmed it once I realized that I didn't want to think as hard as this was going to make me think. Well -written, and for those ready for it I am sure it will be great."

One of the better books I have read this year
77,0345531434,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3259092-ellen,4,"This book was fascinating. Much of it was over my head since I am, as another reviewer put it, a physics naif. But it has inspired me to do more physics/cosmology reading, which is remarkable."

80,0345531434,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14491402-steve,1,Much more science than story. I decided to put it down and start a different book rather than just scan page after page of physics.
