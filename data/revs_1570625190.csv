0,1570625190,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9503655-james-k,3,"Don't look to Capra for a highly disciplined discourse on particle physics or the nature of cosmology. Nor is this book a deep exploration of Taoism or other Eastern Religious Philosophy. Rather, it is a fascinating mental adventure showing the ways the two schools of thought often developed in parallel and came to similar conclusions from very different beginning points. The author's own words in the epilogue sum it up nicely. ""Science does not need mysticism and mysticism does not need science, but man needs both.""That's what I said before reading extensively in physics and cosmology and before watching so many charlatans and the honest but misguided people duped by them try to sell Woo-Woo in place of solid science. I wish I had not written the review above, but I'll let it stand as mute warning to be careful of lay interpretations of science. And a Medical Doctor like Dr. Robert Lanza or a New Age/Alternative Medicine guru like Depak Chopra is not a particle physicist. Their pronouncements on quantum mechanics are no more valid than mine would be if I suddenly set out to perform delicate surgery. It's very true that weird, seemingly mystical things do go on at the tiny scale of the atom where quantum physics operates. It is NOT true, however, that you can scale that quantum weirdness up to the macro level where human beings, planets, galaxies and universes operate, and draw realistic inferences on the parallels between the macro world and Eastern mysticism. Here's a good discussion of the Woo effect and why it should be avoided, provided by British Physicist Dr. Phil Moriarty on the Sixty Symbols Channel on YouTube."
1,1570625190,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4659464-jessaka,3,"I have had this book in my possession off and on over the years, ever since I worked for the author, Fritjof Capra, when I lived in Berkeley in the late 70s. I only knew then that he was a physicist, not realizing that there was such a thing as quantum physics, which I was not introduced to until 2000. Fritjof was a really interesting person, that is, what I knew about him, which wasn’t much since I was only his housekeeper. Cleaning homes was how I got through college.Seeing his home, I realized that I got the job because I advertised myself as being meticulous. Fritjof was meticulous. And I loved his house. It was a brown shingled one on a street in Berkeley. It was obvious that he loved nature. His hardwood floors were covered with grass mats that were not easy to clean because you had to vacuum under them as dirt fell into the holes in the design. He had photos on the wall of John Lennon and Yoko Ono, then of his doing Tai Chi. On one of his tables he had the I Ching and a book titled How to Meditate. I borrowed the latter book and read it. He gave me a stack of Brain/Mind Bulletins that I loved and wish now that I had kept. I went out and bought my own copy of The Tao of Physics, read the first chapter and decided it was not any book that I could understand. I now see that I was correct. As to meditation, I took TM back then, paid $350 for it, which I now realize was a ripoff, and I never used it. Still, the few times I had, but only when with my teacher, my mind expanded somewhat, and I found that peaceful, but I also found it interesting that there was another state of consciousness. I joined the Vedanta Society in early 2000s, and a man named Dave DeLuca came to the temple in San Diego and gave a lecture on The Four Yugas. He had a section in it where he talked about Quantum Physics. Much like Capra’s book, he used the teachings of Quantum theory as a way to compare it with Hinduism. I liked his lecture so much that obtained his lecture and still have it. It wasn’t the comparison to Hinduism that I liked, but the way physicists saw the nature of reality. (I didn’t last in Vedanta, but that is another story.)I listened again to DeLuca’s lecture to see what I remembered, and to write this in my review as it say, this is why I love quantum physics, even though I don’t understand it. He began with saying, “All things are temporary manifestations of God.” Then he mentioned the great physicist, Schodinger and Deepak Chopra’s book, Quantum Healing.Chopra had said that that the molecules that are in us today can be in a tree or another person tomorrow, and the molecules that were in the moon a month ago could be in us today. He stated that this is not figuratively but literally. But much of this was lost on me, but the idea of our molecules flowing in and out of our body was fascinating. DeLuca, like Capra, spent a somee time on comparing quantum physics with the Upanishads, but Capra also compared it to what Buddha had said about the nature of reality. While I could see what they both were talking about, I was not so sure that it could be applied in such a way because what the Buddha and the Upanishads had said were too vague to me.Then DeLuca quoted from another quantum physicist, Max Planck: “I regard consciousness as fundamental. I regard matter as derivative from consciousness. We cannot get behind consciousness. Everything that we talk about, everything that we regard as existing, postulates consciousness.” So what did I get out of reading Capra? Not much. He had some chapters on Hinduism and Buddhism that I understood since I had been in both religions. I saw where he was coming from in regards to his comparisons. But then Capra brought up a vague notion of karma, and I, personally, do not believe in karma. Perhaps the way he sees karma is not the way that it was taught to me by these religions, which end up sounding much like Christianity in that if you do what is wrong you will end up in some hell, and yes, Buddhism and Hinduism both have hells. I think the idea of karma developed over time, as it was not mentioned in the early Vedas that I am aware of, as I had looked, and when it finally was, it was vague. Then one day, a new Upanishad is written and, well, there is hell in all its glory. I I also really liked what Schodinger said about Consciousness: “There is no framework where we find consciousness in the plural.” And this, to me, says what the Upanishads have said about the nature of reality, “All is one,” and this is what some who have meditated have experienced—a oneness with all."
2,1570625190,http://goodreads.com/user/show/186806-ben,1,"It is widely recognized, at least by those outside of science, that scientists are notorious bunglers when it comes to philosophical matters. So it is not surprising, though hardly excusable, that Capra's book displays a level of incompetence that should be immediately obvious to anyone with even a cursory background in logic or philosophy. As a matter of fact, it would be surprising if such an unqualified admirer of Taoism, whose writings Capra notes approvingly are ""full of passages reflecting the Taoist's contempt of reasoning"" (p. 113), should display much in the way of sound reasoning. While I was not especially sympathetic to Capra's thesis even before I read the book, I at least had high hopes for a compelling argument for his case, but that was wishful thinking. The thesis is that the worldviews of Eastern mysticism provide the best framework for understanding modern physics, and that all the advances in physics in the 20th century unanimously confirm these worldviews. However, the picture that emerges is rather one of the utter incompatibility of Eastern mysticism with physics of any kind, classical or modern.In order to fully appreciate the force of this book, it is important to keep in mind not only the results of physics, but also the scientific endeavor itself. That endeavor consists of an incredibly strenuous exertion of the human rational faculties to uncover truths about reality that we do not know ahead of time, and to systematize the results of investigation into rigorous theories explaining the phenomena. In contrast to this, according to Capra, ""all concepts about reality formed by the human mind are void"" (p. 97); ""the human intellect can never comprehend the Tao"" (p. 113); ""whenever you want to achieve anything, you should start with its opposite"" (p. 115); ""words can never express the ultimate truth"" (p. 122); ""to believe that our abstract concepts of separate 'things' and 'events' are realities of nature is an illusion"" (p. 131); the particles of modern physics ""are merely idealizations which are useful from a practical point of view, but have no fundamental significance"" (p. 137); ""all the concepts we use to describe nature . . . are not features of reality, as we tend to believe, but creations of the mind"" (p. 161); ""the idea of a constant 'self' undergoing successive experiences is an illusion"" (p. 212); ""all phenomena in the world are nothing but the illusory manifestation of the mind and have no reality on their own . . . what appears to be external does not exist in reality"" (p. 277); ""ultimately, there are no parts at all in this interconnected web"" (p. 330); ""there is no absolute truth in science"" (p. 337). This collection of quotes does indeed give an excellent picture of the foundation that Eastern mysticism has to offer for science, but is it even possible to think that this view of the world constitutes fertile soil for the scientific enterprise?A striking feature of many of Capra's central arguments is the profound gulf between his premises and his conclusions, which would be simply laughable if it were not for the fact that so many people stand to be badly led astray. For instance, Capra leaps from Einstein's famous equation E=mc^2 to the most astounding claim in the whole book, that ""modern physicists . . . deny the existence of any material substance"" (p. 204). Can this be serious? This is the logical equivalent of saying that ""magnetism has been discovered to be an aspect of an electromagnetic field, therefore magnetism doesn't exist"" or ""scientists have discovered that houses are made of wood, therefore houses don't exist"". One of Capra's favorite mantras is that modern physics has discovered that material particles ""are not distinct entities"" (p. 209). Even if we accept for the sake of the argument his repeated confusion of existence and measurability, it is difficult to see how the fact that particles interact, influence each other, and in some cases are even indistinguishable, means that they are not distinct entities.If it were not enough to repeatedly outrage every principle of sound reasoning, Capra is equally adept at mangling the most profound discoveries of 20th century physics. He dwells at length on Einstein's General Relativity, arguing that it proves that ""geometry is not inherent in nature but is imposed upon it by the mind"" (p. 162). In actual fact, General Relativity is the scientific rock upon which all the floundering ships in the fleet of subjectivism are dashed. From Einstein we have learned that the true structure of space and time is actually so incredibly foreign to our everyday intuitions that it is not even possible to understand it without the formidable apparatus of non-Euclidean geometry. Capra goes on in the same chapter to give an example that ""shows that we can always determine whether a surface is curved or not, just by making geometrical measurements of its surface, and by comparing the results with those predicted by Euclidean geometry. If there is a discrepancy, the surface is curved; and the larger the discrepancy is - for a given size of figures - the stronger the curvature"" (p. 176). But what is it that is curved or not? Something created by our mind? Why are we doing an experiment at all if the geometry of space is nothing but a creation of the mind? But a mind sunk in the quagmires of Eastern mysticism cannot readily recognize such an obvious point. In all of science there is nothing more ""objective"" than Einstein's General Relativity, a fact of which Einstein himself was well aware.But this discussion brings up another important point. I would like to know, if it is true that in modern physics ""cause and effect lose their meaning"" (p. 81) how, even in principle, anyone could ever do a scientific experiment in atomic physics. If the answer is that cause and effect are just illusions of the sensory world, then the question remains, how can we ever do a scientific experiment? Whence comes this illusion, and how can it possibly be trusted to be reliable? If the answer is that cause and effect are indeed principles of macroscopic and sensory reality, but that they are not a part of the unseen ""ultimate reality"" which underlies all the rest, then I ask, from whence arises this lawfulness in sensory reality? How do we build up from the constituents of a reality where cause and effect are meaningless to an observable world where they are no longer meaningless? This constitutes as insurmountable a leap for logic as it does for science.As the book drags on, Capra continues to weary us with his absurdities. On p. 288 he claims that fundamental constants are ""arbitrary parameters"". What does this even mean? Is Planck's constant arbitrary? I would like to see Capra replace it with something else. On p. 334 he says that ""scientists do not deal with truth (in the sense of a precise correspondence between the description and the described phenomena); they deal with limited and approximate descriptions of reality."" This is certainly contradicted by the staggering precision achieved in modern physics, both in theories and experiments, but such a consideration would most likely not intimidate a mind infatuated with contradictions. Such was certainly not the mind of Johannes Kepler, who spent several years of his life working to account for barely a one tenth of one degree of angle disparity between the orbit of Mars and theory, convinced that the human mind, created in the image of a rational God, could precisely learn the truth about the rational creation of that God. How foreign such a mindset must really be to Eastern mystical thought. Would Kepler have undergone such Herculean intellectual exertions had he shared Capra's conviction that he could attain only limited and approximate knowledge, or would he simply have shrugged his shoulders and decided that Ptolemaic astronomy was ""close enough""?But it is least of all to history that we should look for confirmation of Capra's thesis. In the early chapters he blames Aristotle and Christianity for the ensuing ""lack of interest in the material world"" (p. 22). But what cultures ever displayed a more profound and studious disregard for the material world than the Eastern mystical traditions? And why would they hold in high regard something that is at best a creation of the human mind and at worst a deceptive illusion? On p. 198-199 Capra considers the idea of an oscillating and organic universe, and goes on to say that ""the scale of this ancient myth is indeed staggering: it has taken the human mind more than two thousand years to come up again with a similar concept."" But on the contrary, it took the human mind so many thousands of years to overcome organismic and oscillatory theories of the universe. These theories were ubiquitous in all the great ancient cultures, from the Egyptian to the Babylonian to the Indian to the Chinese to the Mayan to the Greek, and it was exactly this conception that so effectively stifled the optimistic and rational view of nature that is indispensable for science.In conclusion, Capra has done a masterful job of presenting the relevance of Eastern mysticism to modern physics, but even a passing consideration readily reveals that this relevance is only the thorough incompatibility of Eastern mysticism with science of any kind. As Western culture steadily abandons rationality and the human ability to know truth, the philosophies of Eastern mysticism do indeed continue to gain credence and ascendance, but to exactly the same extent we will surely witness the decline of science.

3,1570625190,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3802880-chiara,4,"Ok so I have a small confession to make. I think I might be overrating books. Or at least it looks like it from other reviews I recently read. I usually read them after rating the books myself but sometimes I go the other way around. Today is one of those days. I must say I find it harder to criticize a bad non–fiction book than a bad novel. And that could be because, first of all, with non–fiction books it's hardly a matter of writing style (unless it's a really good book or a really bad one) and second of all I'm easily amazed by the knowledge I acquire on things I had no previous idea of. Having said that, I really liked this book. As the book title itself states it's about drawing parallels between modern physics and eastern beliefs. Let me just say: there's actually a lot to talk about, more than I would have imagined. It gives a nice overview on eastern cultures and on those physical phenomena that can be linked to them. I thought it a really interestingly mind–blowing idea I then discovered being already largely discussed in the physics world, with a lot of actual physicists having studied eastern philosophies and all. This book does a good job in underlining similarities between very different culture fields, something I've always found amazingly fascinating. I would recommend it to anyone who is always been curious of eastern cultures but never fulfilled that curiosity."
4,1570625190,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6376052-lois-keller,1,"Well, this is my first one star on good reads, that means this book was even worse than the Third Hunger Games book.The main reason for the one star is just my complete disappointment in this book. I went in to reading 'The Tao fo Physics' expecting to find something that correlated elements of quantum mechanics to the insights of Eastern mysticism and philosophy (which I feel was a reasonable expectation). However, what I found was an author who not only was dull but founded his 'correlations' on the beliefs of famous physicists and philosophers. For a good 1/3 of the book, you, the reader, are submitted to a quote by Einstein (or insert another well known physicist name here) and then a quote by the Buddha (or insert another philosopher, unknown or known here) and Capra going, ""see they are saying the same thing!!"". Nothing irks me more than this in nonfiction books about physics that target the general public - why have my own beliefs or both explaining things when I can say this landmark figure said this at some point (whether it be in context or not) and therefore it must be true. Ironically, the one thing I really do feel Eastern mysticism and physics have in common are that both demand that if you seek more knowledge, you must always question everything and through this incessant questioning, you begin to gain understanding. Our author here could use a little more of that in his writing ability. I have very little positive to say about this book unfortunately. I learned a little bit more about Eastern philosophies than I knew, but I feel like there are other books out there that could have conveyed the information Capra tries to present more effectively. I really would not recommend this book to anyone - I fell asleep ~20 times reading this book (no joke, even when I wasn't tired this book put me to sleep), I feel like I gained very little knowledge or understanding from this book, and at some points, it was painfully banal to read. Capra is not good at explaining physics, Eastern mysticism, and certainly not the link between the two. "
5,1570625190,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4033746-piyush,1,"Eastern philosophy is not a singular concept - it consists of many schools of thought; some of which the author has conveniently cherry-picked and force fit to draw parallels with Quantum Physics.Truth be told, the book neither has literary merit, nor does it present any groundbreakingly profound idea. There is a pretence of the latter, but anyone with some familiarity with the field of philosophy will see right through it. The only merit in the book, if one is to force himself to find one, is to see how an author can paraphrase a simple idea again and again, hiding it under the guise of different metaphors and clothing it in different phrases, and make a whole book out of it. To see this, one would have suspend the idea that the author's intent matters at all, and and then appreciate the fact that Fritjof Capra has produced a tribute to Queneau's Exercises in Style, albeit accidentally. As a matter of fact, I can reproduce the whole book here - and save you the time and expense. Here it is:Nature/ environment/ the territory/features of reality/heaven and earth/the universe/material world/matterIS NOT passive/inert/in static equilibrium/still, BUT IS dancing/dynamic/moves/in vibrating motion with rhythmic patterns/ceaseless motion. Notions of Space and Time are merely constructs of the mind/forms of thought/maps of reality/limited/illusory/relative/ intellectual constructs/moh-maya/exist in relation to our ""particularising consciousness""/ belong to the realm of experience. And modern physics agrees."
6,1570625190,http://goodreads.com/user/show/828304-erik,5,"A book that fundamentally changed the way I felt and thought deep down inside at a time of my life when I needed some sort of metaphysical path.When you strip away the mathematics from the concepts of quantum mechanics and strong theory, etc., you get a bewildering array of thought-provking images that conjure up those posed by the best koans that Zen has to offer. Eastern mysticism meets modern physics.You will understand that everything is connected."
7,1570625190,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1651956-riku-sayuj,4,Not entirely sure how to take this book. Will come back to it after updating myself on the latest developments.
8,1570625190,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21675244-stian,3,"I bought this book some 7 years ago, when I was fifteen. At the time I was getting increasingly interested in physics, and at the same time Buddhism. Unfortunately, I also read another book around this time called 'What The Bleep Do We Know?' which turned out to be nothing but 'quantum woo' - that is, pretending that quantum mechanics is all kinds of things that it simply isn't. I decided that The Tao Of Physics is probably something similar and it's been collecting dust on my shelf ever since. Reading this book, though, I realised that this isn't really what this book is. Sure, there are legitimate criticisms to be made here. For example, some of the similarities are superficial at best. The part that really struck me as overly silly is this part right before section III of the book. On the left page you see, essentially, some scribbled math equations. On the right page you see some Hindu scriptures. I mean, come on! This means absolutely nothing. Another serious criticism has come from Peter Woit, about the fact that Capra uses (and continued to use) the bootstrap theory: 'The Tao of Physics was completed in December 1974, and the implications of the November Revolution one month earlier that led to the dramatic confirmations of the standard-model quantum field theory clearly had not sunk in for Capra (like many others at that time). What is harder to understand is that the book has now gone through several editions, and in each of them Capra has left intact the now out-of-date physics, including new forewords and afterwords that with a straight face deny what has happened. The foreword to the second edition of 1983 claims, ""It has been very gratifying for me that none of these recent developments has invalidated anything I wrote seven years ago. In fact, most of them were anticipated in the original edition,"" a statement far from any relation to the reality that in 1983 the standard model was nearly universally accepted in the physics community, and the bootstrap theory was a dead idea ... Even now, Capra's book, with its nutty denials of what has happened in particle theory, can be found selling well at every major bookstore. It has been joined by some other books on the same topic, most notably Gary Zukav's The Dancing Wu-Li Masters. The bootstrap philosophy, despite its complete failure as a physical theory, lives on as part of an embarrassing New Age cult, with its followers refusing to acknowledge what has happened.'Although this is a valid criticism, it ignores the biggest part of the book. In the first half of the book Capra simply discusses the similarities in thought between these two distinctly different ways of thinking - an intuitive and 'spiritual' way contra the empirical and rational way of science. He doesn't imply that there is something mystical about quantum mechanics, nor does he pull any New Age-trickery trying to fool you in the way that Deepak Chopra might. For the most part in this book Capra is simply looking at the interesting similarities between these two ways of thinking - and they are striking. It's not like Capra is the first physicist to notice this. Capra uses a lot of quotes in this book (from scientists and religious figures), and here are three interesting ones: ""The general notions about human understanding...which are illustrated by discoveries in atomic physics are not in the nature of things wholly unfamiliar, wholly unheard of, or new. Even in our own culture they have a history, and in Buddhist and Hindu thought a more considerable and central place. What we shall find is an exemplification, and encouragement, and a refinement of old wisdom."" Robert Oppenheimer, 1954.""For a parallel to the lesson of atomic theory...[we must turn] to those kinds of epistemological problems with which already thinkers like the Buddha and Lao Tzu have been confronted, when trying to harmonize our position as spectators and actors in the great drama of existence."" Niels Bohr, 1958""The great scientific contribution in theoretical physics that has come from Japan since the last war may be an indication of a certain relationship between philosophical ideas in the tradition of the Far East and the philosophical substance of quantum theory."" Werner Heisenberg, 1958And here is a picture of Niels Bohr's coat-of-arms, featuring the yin-yang symbol and the words 'contraria sunt complementa,' meaning 'opposites are complementary.'At the end of the day I simply think about this book as an interesting musing on different ways of thinking about the world and different ways of getting to answers,and some of those answers happened (by complete chance; there is so mystical connection implied here!) to be correct - or at least in the same ballpark! To me, it also underscores what a spriritual endeavour science potentially can be. "
9,1570625190,http://goodreads.com/user/show/578242-johnny,1,"This book would have been better called ""The Buddha of Physics"", or something like that. Throughout the whole book there is hardly a single reference to taoism, and certainly no understanding of taoism and its relation to other asian religions.The great majority of the spiritual/religious references in this book are from Indian Buddhism and Hinduism. A mild smattering of zen. Hardly any Chinese Buddhism.I found this book incredibly boring. I think I actually started skimming towards the end, which for me before I had a daughter was pretty extreme. I think I found one interesting idea in this whole book, the physics concept of bootstrapping, which took up no more than one or two sentences and a footnote.If you are really interested in learning how taoism, or asian mysticism in general, relates to modern concepts in physics, the Dancing Wu Li Masters by Gary Zukav is much much better."
10,1570625190,http://goodreads.com/user/show/188006-adam,4,"This book bridged a major divide in my perception of the world, bringing together ideas of Quantum Physics and Eastern Mysticism. Capra, trained in both disciplines, does a fine job comparing quotes and emerging universal perceptions of the early pioneers in quantum physics, against philosophers and yogis of the ancient religions of the East. In a beautiful way, you come to discover that each of these disparate disciplines are somehow describing the universe through strikingly similar metaphors. Its not too sci-techy for the average reader, and further gives a great overview of the major Eastern religions, their early founders and principles they are based off."
11,1570625190,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1667021-may-ling,5,"Summary: A seminal piece that has been going on for 35 editions at this point. You kind of have to read it. I liked lots of it and now better understand the hubbub. Left me wondering if its that we see what we want to see. Whether or not you'll like vs. love this book has to do with i) where you are spiritually, ii) how much you know about eastern culture and religion, iii) how much you know about science, and iv) what you've been taught all along.For me, I grew up in the States, but in the South. Additionally, I come from dual cultures and a heavy science background (I knew about/could name quarks definitely by age 12 and that was in the 80s). As a result, this book is better for me as an appreciation for what is confusing. Here's the thing.... if you're pure western, there is this idea of a split between science and nature, It's crazy. Now it seems like that is not the thing with this book, but when you think to self, all of Eastern Philosophy is nature-based, i.e. it grew out of Animalism, which was worship of nature (although it was later poorly named, so people think its about animal sacrifice). Ok, and Physics... the idea that it is somehow divorced from nature... is fascinating. And I can get that, b/c a lot of physics moves a person toward machines. But you know, like patterns that derive from patterns even in randomness are still, not patterns... a la mandelbrott, but whatevs...Ok, so that's my quick summary of the point of this book, here's the stuff I wanna keep in the way of quotes. P. 27 there is a concept of relative knowledge that Capra draws as a parallel to relativity. The rest of the chapter goes through all the implications and how this has been determined through science. It's highly relevant in today's time of data centrism. But it also means that there are multiple realities of which all can be right. Think to watch a train from a stationary point vs moving train stuff. I'm down.P. 45. I love the two quotes by D.T. Suzuki and W. Heisenberg on Language. Very powerful for today's world of NLP. I think people have to remember that words are imperfect communication devices. He talks about the precision of math language vs. what we then translate that to verbally. I mean, I think it actually goes vice versa as well, but all good. P. 51 I like how he ends this chapter. He's like.. dude... physics is about stuff that is so small you can't see it. So you are past your ability to sense stuff. His point it turns out that when you get outside of sensation, you enter the philosophical. Well, his idea is the more you do that in science you find at peace with Eastern religion. Curious, no?P. 68, he talks about the fact that matter is actually waves. We kind of know this in the equation E-mc^2, but people don't really think about the implications philosophically. If it is not matter that separates us from other things, what is it? He then takes it into this concept of we are all one. He needs a few more chapters to let that run. For friends that can handle it, I have talked about this relationship between your energy and your physical being. A lot of the meditation and monks think in these terms. Understanding what it means to own you power/energy and transcend your physical limitations is the work of the next few decades for sure. But it's not stated here. P. 87-88. I really know nothing of Hinduism and must read the Vedas. Karma, I have studied a bit, but Maya I know donut but love it. The idea is that we are in a state of Maya, which people translate into illusion, but it's imperfect. Maya is this kind of fixed reality viewpoint mentioned at an earlier point in the book. Karma is not so much good or bad, as it's a force that we move with or against. (This I'm inspired to read the vedas to better understand). The deal is that because of Maya we move against karma. But we need to evolve and understand the two and then become one with karma/nature. I seriously dig that way of thinking... P. 95.... He reviews all of Buddha's noble truths. There are 4. I never thought about how nice it is just to have 4 truths and to study the heck out of them. I think of the 4 as 1) suffering is the deal 2) it sucks 3) you have the power and are the source of suffering 4) enlightenment ... not easy, but it's how you end the suffering. His set us is for late as we shift from a very specific view and purpose of science to this other thing, which we're already seeing. Like... we're def in stage 3, we know that we're killing this earth and poisoning each other via a non-gmo/pesticides/etc food supply. It's just trying to figure out the path out of it. very cool. P. 109. It's like fate threw this book in my path. I was watching The Man in the High Castle and I was trying to remember why in the plot she was looking at ba gua looking hexagrams (spoiler .. sorry). Well dude.. it's right here. She was referencing the Book of Changes. Sooo adding that to the reading list. P. 117... he talks about non-action in the context of Daoism. I'll just quote: ""Non-action does not mean doing nothing and keeping silent. Let everything be allowed to do what it naturally does, so that its nature will be satisfied."" I love this. It's basically saying: dude... don't push stuff. Nature doesn't push, it just is. It moves around stuff happens. Things evolve. Enjoy the show, man. So difficult to embrace in modern society.P. 142 - He talks about the idea in the Tao that a duality is a weird form of unity (for lack of a better way to see it) because we are seeing the other that actually doesn't exist. This is kind of like extreme quantum physics... so yeah... I kinda see it... profound Capra. I get that you're into the whole unified theory thing.P. 163 he talks about how in Buddhism space and times are constructs vs the Western world where they are concrete things. Capra full props on that. You're right. That does make the whole relativity, time as a 4th dimension thing way easier for Eastern minds. P. 194 he quotes the Tao which says stuff like: The Stillness in Stillness is not real stillness. In the context of science that is SUPER true. I mean we are all these crazy waves and matter is just energy captured at a particular frequency, so yeah dude... Tao said it like it is.P. 204 He talks about samsara and the way that Buddhists experience an object as an event rather than an object. Our experience of it is something that happens at a place and time. I kinda dig this in a major way as I am also a minimalist... and this take it to a whole other level if you think of a profound tie of this nature (science, philosophy, religion). p. 241, more iteration of the electrons looking more like a dance than a wave or an actual particle. This idea that movement in a particular time is all you got. P. 296 he talks about hadrons and this I really did not know. I mean, when you study waves, you thnk ... oh, it looks like a wave. But actually the wave is a physical probabilistic diagram. For Hadron particles that's the deal. I got to incorporate this into my meditation. I think I am constrained by the concept of waves that I have in my head.p. 311 this is where it becomes so much more clear why he's saying stuff early on about words not being able to describe stuff after we split it past the point of being able to sense it with our main senses. I did not know about this whole Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen experiment aka EPR that disproved that all these different theories just need to be connected. Basically, this dude David Bohm is like.. good try but that's not how stuff behaves. So like, b/c this stuff has no matter and that our concept of object is flawed b/c we don't quite get that time and space deal means that, the idea that any particle spins on its axis is missing the point. The point is that there is no axis or at least one with enough permanence to give any kind of credence to that sort of silliness. Props dude... that must have been really hard to get to. P. 325 This is the after part and I dig it. He talks about the way we go about solving problems in such a 1D light, when they are all part of this complex system flow. Oh man... it's so hard to talk to people in these terms. They get overwhelmed, but you are so right. good to hear the frustration at articulation so I can appreciate how you've evolved the way you think/talk about it.I guess my only deal with the book is that you can fit anything into anything else. So both science and the tao come from a study of nature. So are we just using the rich language of the tao or is this really reality... I guess the point of the book is we can't really know."

Brahma, excused himself for a minute, and returned to give his consent exactly a minute later. The king returned happily to his kingdom on earth. But, lo and behold, 1200 years had passed. At this point of the story, my grandmother would smile at me and say, ""What is a minute for Brahma, is 1200 years for earthlings."" My 10 year-self would just be intrigued by the story.Years later, when I got acquainted with Einstein's theory of relativity and the 'personal' nature of time and space, the first question came to my mind, what came first? Einstein's theory or my grandmother's story? Vivekananda in his famous address at Chicago said, ""From the high spiritual flights of the Vedanta philosophy, of which the latest discoveries of science seem like echoes, …."" Well, echoes or not, but the striking parallels cannot be ignored. And not only with Hindu religion, but also with most oriental philosophies. This book sketches out some of those parallels.The most important characteristic of the Eastern world view - one could almost say the essence of it - is the awareness of the unity and mutual interrelation of all things and events, the experience of all phenomena in the world as manifestations of a basic oneness. All things are seen as interdependent and inseparable parts of this cosmic whole; as different manifestations of the same ultimate reality. The Eastern traditions constantly refers to this ultimate, indivisible reality which manifests itself in all things, and of which all things are parts. It is called Brahman in Hinduism, Dharmakaya in Buddhism, Tao in Taoism.... ... ...... ... ...Quantum theory forces us to see the universe not as a collection of physical objects, but rather as a complicated web of relations between the various parts of a unified whole. The western approach, which reflects predominantly in classical physics, is that of reductionism. We can understand the thing, if we can understand its basic constituents. So classical physics takes a lots of assumptions and help of constants to go deeper, finer into substances. On the contrary, the eastern approach, which now the modern physics seem to adapt, tends towards holism. The whole is greater and more complex than the sum of its parts. And there is more ambiguity than constants. Quantum theory thus reveals an essential interconnectedness of the universe. It shows that we cannot decompose the world into independently existing smallest units. As we penetrate into matter, we find that it is made of particles, but these are not the 'basic building blocks' in the sense of Democritus and Newton. They are merely idealizations which are useful from a practical point of view, but have no fundamental significance. In the words of Neils Bohr, ""isolated material particles are abstractions, their properties being definable and observable only through their interactions with other systemsConflicting and confusing theories exist simultaneously in oriental theories. As if sides of same coin. Nothing is constant. The laws are dependent on the observer than any kind of absolutes. And if we see the quantum theory, that falls in line with similar thought process. The cat is neither dead nor alive, you see. In the words of OppenheimerIf we ask, for instance, whether the position of the electron remains the same, we must say ‘no’; if we ask whether the electron’s position changes with time, we must say ‘no’; if we ask whether the electron is at rest, we must say ‘no’; if we ask whether it is in motion, we must say ‘no’.The reality of the atomic physicist, like the reality of the Eastern mystic, transcends the narrow framework of opposite and contradictory concepts. The Upanishads say:""It moves, it moves not,It is far, and it is near,It is within all this,And it is outside of all this.I don't know much about Buddhism and Taoism. But, with my limited knowledge on Hinduism, I can't call it entirely scientific. However, the parallels of some of its theories with modern science indeed make me question, ""How did they know, then?"""
13,1570625190,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1260250-jen,4,"I really liked this book; but I admit it had flaws, mainly due to the actual content in relation to the title. First, this book reads more like a review of quantum physics (a subject I'm not qualified to give a critique on in terms of the book's accuracy) than religion. In many cases, the author goes on for pages about quantum physics, in technical detail, and then at the very end sticks in a throw away line about how this is similar to Buddhism or Hinduism because they both believe we are all connected, just like on the quantum level. I thought the way the two were tied together was in all reality, weak.However, having said this, I liked the book for two main reasons: 1- I'm fascinated by quantum physics (even though I have no formal education) and I'm always looking for books that explain it in simpler terms to me. There was probably nothing new in the book, but for me, he explained things in ways that enabled me to make better connections. I don't have the book in front of me to give examples, but for one, I finally understood why there aren't really any fundamentally basic particles and the importance of the role of the observer to the experiment. I also gained a better understanding of the basics of protons, quarks, neutrinos, etc. This knowledge by itself enriched me from a spiritual point of view, which brings me to my next reason for liking the book:2- The well laid out explanation of physics allowed me to make the connection to spirituality on my own. In truth, he didn't really need to spell out the similarities and connections to any religion, because on my own, I was able to reach outside the world of quantum physics to postulate a bigger meaning in all aspects of life. I understand that most scientists, whose jobs require them to be very rigid in their theories, experiments and conclusions, probably cringe at taking science into the spiritual realm, but in the realities of everyday life, we don't live on such a rigid scale. I can't separate my feelings, thoughts, physical reactions, spirituality etc. into neat little boxes like a science experiment- they all blend together to form my life. So to me, it seems inevitable that the more we learn about the world and what it is made of from a scientific viewpoint, the more we are going to ask, what does it all mean in the bigger picture of life?That is what this book did for me; it made me think about the overall implications of what we are learning scientifically about the world and wonder what it means to us on a human level. I believe from both a scientific and spiritual side that we are all connected and, without getting all new age-y, the implications of this can be profound because we are able to see that what we do to ourselves, each other and the planet are not done in isolation- there is a rippling effect across the universe. I'll stop here as I don't want to preach; I'll just say I recommend this book to people like me, who are spiritual, but also appreciate the rational science behind the 'mystique.' I like the balance between the two.Those who are not spiritual in any way; who only believe in that which can be proven with rigid scientific experiments probably need to stay away from this book."

Rather than a conventional book summary or review, I would like to capture key sentences/ quotes that adorn the terrain like a string of pearls:Chapter 1 – Modern Physics: A Path with a HeartAny path is only a path, and there is no affront, to oneself or to others, in dropping it if that is what your heart tells you....Look at every path closely and deliberately. Try it as many times as you think necessary. Then ask yourself, and yourself alone, one question....Does this path have a heart? If it does, the path is good; if it doesn’t it is of no use. -	Carlos Castaneda, The Teachings of Don JuanChapter 2 – Knowing and SeeingA mystical experience, therefore, is not any more unique than a modern experiment in physics. On the one hand, it is not less sophisticated either, although its sophistication is of a very different kind. The complexity and efficiency of the physicist’s technical apparatus is matched, if not surpassed, by that of the mystic’s consciousness – both physical and spiritual – in deep meditation. The scientists and mystics, then, have developed highly sophisticated methods of observing nature which are inaccessible to the lay person.-	Fritjof CapraChapter 3 – Beyond LanguageThe contradiction so puzzling to the ordinary way of thinking comes from the fact that we have to use language to communicate our inner experience which in its very nature transcends linguistics-	D.T. SuzukiChapter 4 – The New PhysicsAl my attempts to adapt the theoretical foundation of physics to this (new type of) knowledge failed completely. It was as if the ground had been pulled from under one, to no firm foundation to be seen anywhere, upon which another one could have been built-	Albert EinsteinChapter 5 – HinduismAll actions take place in time by the interweaving of the forces of nature, but the man lost in selfish delusion thinks that he himself is the actor. But the man who knows the relation between the forces of nature and actions, sees how some forces of Nature work upon other forces of nature, and becomes not their slave-	The Bhagavad GitaChapter 6 – BuddhismAshvaghosa probably had a strong influence on Nagarjuna, the most intellectual Mahayana philosopher, who used a highly sophisticated dialectic to show the limitations of all concepts of reality........Hence he gave it the name ‘Sunyata’, ‘the void’, or ‘emptiness’, a term which is equivalent to Ashvaghosa’s ‘tathata’ or ‘suchness’; when the futility of all conceptual thinking is recognized, reality is experienced as pure suchness.- Fritjof CapraChapter 7 – Chinese ThoughtThat which lets now the dark, now the light appear is Tao-	I Ching, the Book of ChangesChapter 8 – TaosimDisputation is a proof of not seeing clearly.-	Chuang TzuChapter 9 – ZenBefore you study Zen, mountains are mountains and rivers are rivers; while you are studying Zen, mountains are no longer mountains and rivers are no longer rivers; but once you have had enlightenment, mountains are once again mountains and rivers again rivers.-	Zen sayingChapter 10 – The Unity of All ThingsOne is led to a new notion of unbroken wholeness which denies the classical idea of analyzability of the world into separately and independently existing parts...We have reversed the usual classical notion that the independent ‘elementary parts’ of the world are the fundamental reality, and that the various systems are merely particular contingent forms and arrangements of these parts. Rather, we say that inseparable quantum interconnectedness of the whole universe is the fundamental reality, and that relatively independently behaving parts are merely particular and contingent forms within this whole-	David BohmChapter 11 – Beyond the World of OppositesIt moves.

15,1570625190,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18716604-murray,1,"I'm afraid as hard as I tried I could not make this book work for me. The author discusses a lot about quantum physics (as it was understood in the 1970's) and eastern mysticism. He attempts to correlate the two. The assertions were broad and conjectural, and I ended up confused about both. That may be my fault, not the author's, but so be it.I was wading through another treatise on quantum physics and relativity at the same, Paul Davie's ""The Goldilocks Enigma: Why is the Universe Just Right for Life?"" I will write a separate review for this book eventually. Suffice it to say that Professor Davies has an insight that made more sense than anything Capra has to say. Quoting Dr. Davies: ""The history of philosophy is so rich and diverse that it would be astonishing if theories emerging from science hadn't been foreshadowed in some vague way by somebody""That just about sums up my conclusions about Capra's conclusions. Nothing more than vague foreshadowing."
16,1570625190,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23888196-rama,5,"The Brahman of physicsThis is one of the best books I have read which ties the philosophies of Vedanta (Hinduism), Buddhism and Taoism with the laws of physics. The book is divided into three sections; the first section gives a general introduction to the facts of physical reality. The second section discusses the philosophies of Hinduism with references to Bhagavad-Gita and Upanishads; Buddhist philosophy and Chinese thought. The last section discusses the laws of Newtonian physics, and how the reality experienced through classical principles has changed after the discovery of relativistic and quantum physics. The concepts of physics discussed in this section require some undergraduate level physics. The summary of this book is given below: In relativity, space and time are intimately connected and form a four dimensional continuum; hence they can not be treated separately. There is no universal time flow as in Newtonian dynamics. This means that different observers order events differently in time if they move with different velocities relative to the observed events. In such a case two events which are seen as occurring simultaneously by one observer may occur in different temporal sequences for other observers. All measurements involving space and time thus lose their absolute significance. The absolute space, which is a stage for physical event in Newtonian physics, is abandoned along with the concept of absolute time. Spacetime becomes an element of a language that a particular observer uses for describing a physical event. Relativistic physics also treats gravity as a manifestation of matter curving spacetime in its vicinity, and it also showed that mass is a form of energy and hence it can not be viewed as a static object but a dynamic existence. This mass - energy conversions are well demonstrated in particle - antiparticle interactions; energy turns into this pair and when they annihilate they are converted into pure energy. Since the spacetime is of four-dimensional, and in this dimension all events are interconnected. Particle interactions are interpreted as cause and effect only when space-time diagrams are read in one direction. There is no definite direction in the 4D world and hence no before or after and no causation. The wave - particle duality of matter at subatomic level does not mean that the wave is three-dimensional waves like water waves but they are probability waves. They are abstract mathematical quantities which are related to the probabilities of finding the particles in various places. In the absence of certainty, the existence of matter or its non-existence becomes diffused. We can never say that fundamental particles exist or they don't exist or it is neither present nor absent, or it exists and do not exist simultaneously until a physical observation is made. For better understanding of the relationship between pairs of classical concepts, Bohr introduced the notion of complementarity. He suggested that the particle picture and wave pictures are two complementary descriptions of the same reality. Each of them only partly correct and having a limited range of application. Each picture is needed to give the full descriptions of the atomic reality and both are to be applied within the limitations of uncertainty principle. The cosmic web is alive; it grows and changes continually according to the laws of physics. The wave - particle dualism of quantum physics, motions doesn't have paths, existence is reduced to probabilities, and the unification of space and time in relativistic physics implies a highly dynamic interaction with matter wherein all fundamental concepts of reality is interwoven into one reality. The particles are represented by wave packet, and the length of wave packet represents the uncertainty in location. If we localize the particle to a smaller region (length), then the wavelengths will decreases (frequency increases) representing an increase in the velocity and hence the momentum, thus supporting the dynamic nature of reality at its most fundamental level. The dynamic nature is also found at the intergalactic level where the existence of dark matter and dark forces keep the universe in its ever expansionary state. The universe at its edge is moving from us close to the speed of light and farther the cosmic bodies are faster they are moving from us. The laws of atomic physics are statistical laws according to which the probabilities for atomic events are determined by the dynamics of the whole system. Whereas in classical physics the properties and behavior of parts determine those of the whole. In quantum physics this is reversed, the whole determines the behavior of parts. Probability is used in both classical and quantum physics for similar reasons. In both there are hidden variables that prevent us from making exact predictions. The hidden variables in classical physics are local mechanisms and those in quantum physics are non-local. The latter allows instantaneous connection to a pair of entangled particles anywhere in the universe that would otherwise be precluded by the speed limit of light in classical physics. The structure we observe is a manifestation of an underlying process and matter is a form of energy and not mere stuff or substance. Energy is associated with process. In quantum physic the observer and observed no longer remain separated. Deductive philosophy implied that we need to start with fundamental laws that make the basis of knowledge. The fundamental equations, universal constants, basic concepts are the essential ingredients of building knowledge. Research and experimental evidence in support of a phenomenon and a mathematical model to explain the results is fundamental in science. Thus physics is mainly concerned with rational knowledge and the Vedic mysticism is concerned with intuitive knowledge. In the former as one explores the physics of fundamental particles, and the various physical processes in the atomic world it becomes increasingly clear that matter and energy in spacetime are all interconnected, interrelated, and interdependent, and they are understood as a part of the whole. Indian philosophy and Taoism had profound effect on three great quantum physicists; Erwin Schrödinger (expressed strong belief in Vedanta), Werner Heisenberg (expressed strong belief in Buddhist philosophy) and Niels Bohr (expressed strong belief Taoism). "
17,1570625190,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2747498-arun-divakar,2,"My feeling post the completion of this book is utter confusion. The first few chapters of this book gave an eloquent preamble of things to come, a sweeping narrative that would capture the essence of Physics and pit it against the ages-old wisdom of Eastern philosophy. This objective of the book was what caught my attention – that the author sets out to prove that an exacting discipline like Physics can have parallels with religious experiences. How can the rigor of mathematics be paralleled by an experience like mysticism ? Fascinating premise isn't it ? Then I made the mistake of reading about this book and found that all that was built up in a grandiose fashion by Fritjof Capra had been ripped apart by men and women with sharper intellects a long time ago. The mindset I then settled into was akin to reading Erich Von Daniken – not believing a word of what I read and yet fascinated by the imagination of the author.The author is by no means a bad one and I would even venture a few more steps forward and call him a good one for the first two parts of the book. This is where he explains in very light prose as to what constitutes the basics of physics (classical and modern), a little bit on the relativity theory, quantum and atomic physics etc. In another section he does a bare bones observation on the various eastern belief systems – Buddhism, Hinduism, Taoism and a touch of Zen. The section on Hinduism is woefully inadequate for all it has is the cosmic dance of Siva and a slight smirk at the erotic undercurrents of the Tantric systems. Buddhism gets a larger and better treatment and so does the basic ideas of Taoism. The part on Zen is more of an icing on the cake than anything else. It is from here that things get stale, the author flies off to his own pet parallels and offers fantastic theories. For want of a better analogy, Capra pulls of a passably good Malcolm Gladwell – seemingly brilliant theories, fantastic examples and yet no chances to refute them in the examples that he quotes. Unlike Gladwell, the observations do not stick together too well with time. Take a moment to sit back, and re-look at them and they all fall away. Nothing more to be said of that. I don’t suppose this is a book I want to recommend to anyone. A quick twenty minutes reading online about the book will give you more understanding than what the book itself will. The two stars are for the skill of the author at stitching this all together. ‘Nuff said !"
18,1570625190,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2309246-cassandra-kay-silva,3,"Hmmm what to say about this. In some ways I agree that there are a number of parallels at least in the modality of viewing the world through the eyes of the eastern believer and the modern day physicist. But whether or not these parallels are entirely the ones drawn by the author or further expounded on in this book I have some reservations in either regard. Perhaps it was because I did not enjoy being told by the author where these parallels were or being lead around in such a manner. Some of his views of physics seem to be very ""outsidist"" if there is such a term and some of his views of eastern belief seem to be a bit mixed up. Perhaps because he chose all of eastern philosophy which is so wide ranging and so varied instead of focusing on Taoism or Buddhism for example. Though I do think that there are a lot of similarities in different eastern traditions and ways of thought I don't know if it strengthens the authors case to be flitting about between different philosophies in some cases which contradict each other, when there is often left to be much in terms of personal interpretation of these individual philosophies. I think what the author is trying to get at is the overall perspective of modern day physics is somehow aligning with what is already ""known"" in eastern religions. I don't know if that is an important or productive view of the whole matter. I mean what did these religions give us in terms of scientific understanding? And what does science give us in way of spiritual awareness of knowledge? Are these two expected to be married to a happy union? You cannot in my mind marry two ideals that serve different functions. I don't think I would pick this book up as a scientist and say I am now enlightened and turn to the eastern path. Nor do I think that as a believer in any of these eastern paths would I find more grounds for the validity of modern physics. They serve different functions. The parallels drawn did not in my mind make any relation here more concrete. "
19,1570625190,http://goodreads.com/user/show/156533-rob,2,"Similar to how I felt with 
The Elegant Universe
; here was a book that did a good job of giving a survey of ""the known physics"", a good job of explaining the intractable problems, and then a poor job of explaining ""the new way"" (while at the same time hedging as much as possible). The comparisons to Eastern mysticism seemed a little conveniently tacked on, and maybe even a bit cherry-picked. I think the real problem I had with this book though wasn't about the theories (which, you know, ""you can't blame a guy for trying"") but that when a book's popularity catches fire, an authoritative tone can make it that much more convincing to folks (like me) that are not trained in that specific discipline (in this case, high-energy physics)—and so even as the evidence stacks up against the espoused theory (which in this case is the S-matrix theory), there isn't any real serious re-evaluation. (Granted, as that very same lay-person, I'm not sure that I fully understood the S-matrix theory, or the follow-up reading w/r/t/ how it has been mostly discredited.)This is my response in a nutshell though; I'd really like to put together a little more formal of a response. (In due time?)"
20,1570625190,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2709439-ken-deshaies,4,"This is a very interesting treatise on how physics is just catching up with Eastern religions. The more scientists discover about the working of the universe, from the tiniest particles to the most universal truths, the more Eastern mysticism and preachings are substantiated as true. Yet Taoism, Hinduism, Buddhism have been preaching these truths for thousands of years. I was totally fascinated and engrossed. The first few chapters each give a brief overview of the different Eastern religions (philosophies). It helped me understand the differences, when in the past, I tended to lump them all together. The latter part of the book delves into scientific tests, discoveries and the meaning of various things like particle theory. The author wisely warns that the reader will be reading a lot of technical material, and suggests that, unless you are a student of physics or genuinely interested in the details, to simply read as a sort of meditation. He offers that if you take this approach, you will understand a lot more than you would anticipate. I found this to be true, and the reading was enlightening and enjoyable. It's also interesting to know that this book was published in the mid-70s, and so much more has been discovered since then. "

Though highly recommended by others, I didn't enjoy The Dancing Wu-Li Masters, nor the film What the  Do We Know nearly as much(A review of the latter is available here:http://andyrantsandraves.blogspot.com... )I frequently find this book at yard sales and used book stores, and I buy it up every time, so that I can give it away to other people. Because I truly think everyone should read it. I think if they grasped some of the ideas presented here, that the world would be a better place. You might think that I am a naive fool, and I'm okay with that. I'll just be sitting here, meditating, holding mutually exclusive thoughts in my head at the same time."
22,1570625190,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17942027-lage-von-dissen,3,"This book points out many of the parallels between modern physics and Eastern mysticism. In particular we can recognize parallels between many ancient mystic ideas and the modern quantum physical findings of superposition (and non locality), the duality of light and matter, and the ultimate non-physicality of nature. For many years there have been cultures that ascribed to these types of ideas as crazy as they sounded when they first hit the physics arena in the 20th century. These ideas weren't really new at all because mystics and the like had believed them for centuries prior. What was not discovered until this last century was the mathematics and scientific evidence to give these ancient mystic religions and precepts any foundation to be taken seriously, especially since most of society had largely given up on that mysticism for ideas such as atomism, newtonian mechanics, etc. This book does a good job pointing out these parallels and thus demonstrates how the pendulum has swung away from those ancient ideas, and has now begun to swing back."
23,1570625190,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1561247-sebastian,4,This is a great book at showing the parallels between mystical and scientific research.It also does a great job of stimulating visual imagination in the realm of the 4th dimension. This is the first book I have read that has managed to really explain the paradox of quantum-reality more clearly and I can now finally how the paradox of time and location are fundamental issues relating to the fabric of particles rather than with measuring techniques. It also gives a very good visual description of the impact preparation and thus observer plays on results and how nothing you can do can stop you from influencing the particle because of your intention to measure itThe book would have gotten 5-stars but it went too deep for too long near the end w/o further description of the meaning and purpose of such depth. Fritov Capra does this in his other books once in a while too; but in general Fritov is an excellent writer with a very clear and good voice to follow.Excellent book.

Though he claims the book to be meant for the lay person, Capra does offer a very thorough account of what physicists have to say about our theories of the universe, space & time. Alongside, he brings out the parallels between physics and Eastern spiritual traditions.While some parts were no doubt dense for me, overall, I was thrilled to read this book primarily because it made some complex physics somewhat accessible for me."

With an open mind you would be amazed at what flashes of insight you might have."

Does that mean that the one spoken about by mystics is the same one spoken about by physicists. Are the respective wholes one and the same? If you're inclined to think that only science give access to truth, you'll probably answer no to the foregoing questions. If you are inclined to believe that nothing is as it seems and keep an open mind about things science cannot say anything about, you will very likely find the extended metaphor that runs through this book breathtakingly beautiful. Either way, read with an open mind. This book is wonder full!"

The book deals with the relationship between Eastern Mysticism and Modern Physics - both difficult in their own right. I must confess that the physics part of it was way over my head but I could understand enough to see the relationship. The author shows that the principal theories and models of modern physics lead to a view of the world which is consistent and in perfect harmony with the views of Eastern Mysticism. The author goes in depth into Hinduism, Buddhism, and Taoism and I thoroughly enjoyed these descriptions. If you want to read a book which brings science and philosophy together this is the perfect book."

35,1570625190,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75799414-dana-cody,3,"I definitely liked this book. I bought this off Amazon over 4 years ago, and I'm so glad I read it. I think it was a little difficult to get through at times. I feel that Capra often repeated themself, and 'beat around the bush' a great deal. The main points of the book were really interesting and quite beautiful. "
36,1570625190,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5526063-mary-jean-harris,5,"This was an amazing book...combining two of my favourite things, namely, ancient philosophy and mysticism, and physics. In both areas, although I already know a fair bit about them, I still felt that I learned so much more from reading this book, because it takes a new view of each of them. And the style of the book reflects its content: it is an integrated whole that flows beautifully, and you feel that science, philosophy, art, and all such intellectual areas that touch upon the nature of reality is a kind of poetry, a song of the cosmos slowly making itself heard in soft flute blows reaching our ears from sages throughout the centuries. It is ""Shiva's dance"", as Capra puts it.The basic idea of the book is that modern physics not only has coincidental parallels with Eastern mysticism (Taoism, Buddhism, Hinduism, etc.), but that physics is converging toward ideas that have been known to mystics for millenia. Physics is coming to have a more harmonious view of the universe. A universe that is interconnected, a process instead of bits of matter existing in isolation. A universe where there are no fundamental particles, but it contains everything as part of a unified cosmos that is in the process of creation and recreation, and can't be said to exist as particular points, because it is always changing and flowing. This may sounds rather vague, but particle physics is actually taking on some quite similar views, namely, in S-matrix theory and bootstrap models, as well as the dynamic views of quantum field theory and virtual particles.It was particularly interesting to hear about the Chinese and Indian schools of thoughts, and many quotes from both ancient and modern writers were given. And even with physics, although I thought I wouldn't learn anything new in that regard, Capra explained the uncertainty principle in a really neat way that I've never before, and made me think, ""Oh, so that's how it works!"" It was so much clearer the way he wrote it compared to anything else I've learned.Capra has a real talent for synthesizing these distinct areas of thought, and he writes beautifully as well. It is like reading an old philosophy book, not one written in this century: it's interesting, illuminating, and wonderfully written and thought out at the same time.There are also numerous quotes from physicists, mystics, and philosophers, and just from these, I have created a rather substantial reading list for the next year.What's needed next is a book on how ancient Greek and Roman philosophy fits into all this, as well as Kabbalism. There may already be some books on this, so I will hunt to find them, and if there are none, then in the future, I will write them :)So if you are at all interested in physics, mysticism, philosophy, or anything in between, read this book! You will not be disappointed. As far as I can tell, the physics is accurate, even considering that the book is over 40 years old."
37,1570625190,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14536914-roshan,3,"First things first. This book by the author, Fritjof Capra finds its relevance in a way, which helps its readers to develop a correlation between the various proposed theories in Physics on the creation of the Universe (such as The Big Bang Theory) with those of the ones presented in the holy books of various religions namely, Hinduism, Buddhism, Taoism among others. The concept of matter and its constituents is dealt with in a detailed manner in this book, which makes it worthy of a read. The compilation throws light on atoms and the various sub atomic particles with a great sense of attention to details. The common term used to collectively refer to the various preachings of Buddhism, Hinduism, Zen, Chinese thought and Taoism is self explanatory; Eastern Mysticism. The concept of 'Karma' which means 'Work' in Sanskrit, derives its importance and analogy from the elaborated outlook presented on the same using the principles primarily of Hinduism and Buddhism in this manuscript. Nevertheless, this read has more than one ideologies explained to keep its readers completely involved and interested. This book grabs good ratings mainly for the explicit techniques used in the expression and presentation of Physics concepts involving matter, atoms, and sub atomic particles such as electrons, protons, neutrons, nucleus, positrons, eta, photons and many more. The various derivatives from the collision between sub atomic particles, in addition to the path traversed by the same sub particles deserves a mention, for it emphasizes on the need for further research in the various branches of Modern and Quantum Physics. Neutrino is a sub particle discovered newly as a constituent of atoms. The Neutrino particle has its own characteristics such as zero mass, which makes it easily distinguishable from the other sub atomic particles. The author, to an extent is successful in presenting clarity on his uniquely devised methodologies to draw parallels between the existent physical and mythical elucidation of theories on formation of the Universe. The two principles, describing Modern Quantum Physics and Eastern Mysticism; the former presenting a modern outlook, while the latter laying emphasis on the historical mythologies associated with various 'Dharma' or religions, give rise to a vital extension of the theories previously proposed by the Scientific and Spiritual communities, respectively. However, this book does not deny the fact that there's a lot left to be discovered on the physical front as compared to the doctrines of Eastern Mysticism presented in the book. This book could be considered as a breeding ground for those young aspirants of Physics, whose beliefs on the prospects of Physics being a very significant and formidable force in the Modern world has received a major jolt due to the rapid expansion and growth experienced in the Technology sector. The author is not hesitant to state that the branch of Physics i.e. Quantum Physics could reestablish itself and redeem its lost glory to emerge as a competitive and resourceful beneficiary in the technology driven modern world. Also, on the contrary, to the conclusion drawn by the author in the form of the preceding statement, he has not failed to describe the impact, the various nuances presented in the book have had, while using them to highlight the different streams of Quantum applications. On the spiritual front, the book follows the Rules of the Declines, which stresses upon the need for formation and development of more implicit derivations and proposition of moral values. It also, is successful in drawing a thin line between the doctrines of various religions, while also successively establishing a useful link between them. As per Capra, the developments in the world of Modern Physics that have taken place in the twenty first century could result in embellishment of various modern branches of Physics in an intellectual sense.Capra, in his detailed work, replicates a common sentiment very prevalent amongst Scientists in the Scientific community. In that, he makes his ideas known to the world in the form of Quark Symmetries, the Koan Culture, Interpenetration, the law of opposites, while paying more attention towards the commonalities involved in the behavior of the planets, the stars, the sun, the moon and other heavenly bodies, in addition to the impact it has had on the intellectual well being of various branches of Physics. However, the more distinguished guest (metaphorically) in the book, pays a visit to its readers in the form of a satirical (personally for me) comparison between The Nataraja and the cosmic dance of the sub atomic particles, when exposed to electromagnetic field. The unity is there to be experienced, when the author makes full use of his resources to lead the readers to a different zone of realization, capitulation, and meditation. Modern Physics focuses on practicality, while Mysticism is inclined towards the concept of 'Self', is an essence on which the book thrives upon. The book deals with an umpteen number of complex, but significant realities and illusions leaving no stone unturned to convince the readers off Mysticism, as a real and relevant spiritual entity effectively used in the explanation of Modern Physics theories such as formation of the Universe. The hardcover focuses on gaining a new insight on the widely believed and accepted hypothetical, but efficacious theories of continuous expansion and contraction of the universe resulting in a sustained human life development on our planet earth. The minutely microscopic particles such as atoms expand, while the heavenly bodies undergo contraction to maintain desired levels of equilibrium in the Planetary system. This in fact, is the conjoined essence of human life sustenance and the beauty of Modern Physics on Earth and in the Universe. The author also mentions his own moments of uncertainty, while expressing his take on Suzuki and Symbolism pertaining to the rising repercussions it has had on the advent of Buddhism and Chinese thoughts, respectively. Mahayana and Hinayana are two different sub sects of Buddhism and vary significantly in their preachings and practices. The book also shortly reflects on the two divine forms of Buddha - Indian Buddha and the revered Buddha of East. The myth remains undiscovered, whether Buddha lived during two different mythological era. On Hinduism, the author has a very broad, but limited sense of understanding as quoted by an another contemporary writer.The writing of Capra in this book reaches a pinnacle, when he delves deep into the sciences of directions and the corresponding seasons. According to him, the four seasons - Winter, Autumn, Spring, and Summer are a result of schematic representation obtained by rotating the conventional notation twice, in an anti clockwise direction - North, West, East, and South, respectively. The Tao of Physics indeed indicates a cumulative effort on the part of the author to present to his readers, a subtle but differential thesis of his notion on Modern Physics and Eastern Mysticism. A good read for the pupil and pundits well versed with the world of Physics and Mysticism alike. A modest three out of five from my side for this one sided yet uniquely dominant purview of the Universe, in favor of Modern Physics. Enjoy reading."
38,1570625190,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16301128-yogi-travelling,4,"For me I enjoyed how the author presented the differences in the approach towards this subject, from the east and from the west...This book stirred up something within to help me make sense of 'all this' in my own way perhaps...Where from the east it is an inward movement, and where from the west is it an outward movement.... In the east science is inward in the form of Taoism, Tantra, meditation, yoga etc... In the west it is outward in the form of empirical laboratory experiments....Outward in a sense it is observed from a distance... Inward in the sense the observer and observed are one.In the east science and religion is one. In fact it is not religion, it is religiousness. In the west a clear distinction is made between science and religion.I am reminded by an analogy describing Einstein's theory of relativity... Where to truly observe the speed of light, one must be on its ray of light.And where one is not on this ray of light (observing from afar) this outward distance gives room to where the distortion from time comes into play. Where the distance between the observed and the observer gives room for error..."
39,1570625190,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53689026-omar-delawar,4,"This is an amazing book to read if you want to see how some of the most important ideas in eastern mysticism and modern physics are converging. I remember when my High school physics professor mentioned casually I could reinforce the eastern principles of the ""zen"" with the study of physics. I thought he was out of his mind since I thought they were complete opposites. Capra explains so eloquently that science and mysticism are not dichotomies but dialectically in sync. Actually, the ""converging"" is only taking place in our understanding: the concepts and worldviews of the two schools of thought are startlingly similar and have been for some time, and the author does a great job for the most part of drawing the parallels while not getting too technical with the modern physics stuff. Capra ends one more separation that existed for me. Very satisfying read! "
40,1570625190,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40912952-barathram-s,4,"Earnestly following the author's writing will surely paint a mystical veil that the religions based on eastern mysticism are flawless. He creates beautiful parallels between ""Some"" sayings of eastern mystics and some concepts of physics. The reasoning the author utilizes comes close to ""Too right to be not ignored"", but an iota of doubt still lingers at the back of your head. Probably, his assumptions may be articulated better in the future, or as he himself puts it, we may need to transcend consciousness to understand it.On the contrary, this book is Solid Work. If physics is not your cup-of-tea, this book is not for you. I like physics, but not too much to involve in its complicated, manifold interpretations and its theories. It took me two readings of each chapter to just get the hang of the many ""scientific"" chapters. Probably my inefficiency to comprehend this(easily) may explain my lack of understanding. Thus making my criticism(previous paragraph) null and void. I think I will read it again, hoping that my comprehension improves."

And this let's your head and your heart come together rather than fight for control in difficult times. The epilogue explains how science, philosophy and religion aren't the only ways to investigate the mysteries of life...poets, children, clowns, shamans--they're all seekers who bring truths to the surface by being their most natural selves, going inside for answers.Anyhow, one of those books that both right brained and left brained people would enjoy when they're in a place to focus."

Still, the author's simple explanation of complex physics theories did help me learn some things, which is why I'm giving it 2 stars rather than 1.If you listen to the audiobook, skip all of disc 1 if you already know what gravity is or who Faraday is.

56,1570625190,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17702850-nanda-rajanala,3,"Wisdom in books never age no matter when they were written. This book, written way back in the seventies, does enchant the reader with its treatment of subjects in modern physics as related to the quantum world and relativity. The highlight of the book obviously is the association of this abstract form of new-age physics with what the author found as fascinating - Eastern philosophies and mysticism. Presenting his motivation for writing this book almost as a vision he got about Shiva's cosmic dance while sitting on a beach in California, the author goes deep into Tao, Zen, Confucianism and Hinduism just enough to bring the so-called ""parallels"" with modern physics.This book was fantastic in the effort it spent to show what was missing in the Western concepts of philosophy, science, thought and of course society. Everything seemed just about fine until the edition that I had also included future commentaries from the author fifteen years after the book got published and it became a huge universal hit. This was by far the reason why I am forced to give only three stars for the book. In a possibly unknown attempt at showing that his thinking has evolved, he has basically killed the very essence, meaning and purpose of the original intent of this book. Every book is just an expression of a thought or opinion and it is brave of an author to keep learning and refining his. But, the below thoughts of his go beyond that to almost trash the very idea of a heavily debatable and incomprehensible conceptual connect - Eastern mysticism and Modern Physics - that he so painstakingly put together and gained immense fame from.In selling another book of his whose credentials I am not so certain about, this is what he said - ""...Moreover, I no longer believe that we can adopt Eastern spiritual traditions in the West without changing them in many important ways to adapt to our culture. My belief has been enforced by my encounters with many Eastern spiritual teachers who have been unable to understand some crucial aspects of the new paradigm that is now emerging in the West"".The above sentences suddenly made me realize the narrow-mindedness of the author in ways that shocked me, especially after reading a book that he wrote which talks about walking away from these very biased and closed world models that was the representation of classical physics vis-a-vis modern versions of quantum-relativistic concepts. While co-authoring a new book with a Christian monk who strongly represents Catholic values (which is not a problem and is not what shocks me), he has suddenly looked at his own work and trashed it mercilessly as nothing but absolute Orientalism nonsense attached to Modern Science to somehow sound serious.What do these thoughts he shared even mean:""...We can adopt Eastern spiritual traditions..."" - where did he cover this in the Tao of Physics?""...changing them in many important ways to adapt to our culture..."" - change them? to ""adapt"" to ""our"" culture?? what happened to the universal whole?""...My belief has been enforced by my encounters with many Eastern spiritual teachers who have been unable to understand some crucial aspects of the new paradigm..."" - so you spoke to some teachers and who were they? your ""belief"" has been ""enforced""? What was your belief? Someone was unable to understand ""crucial aspects""? of a new paradigm? emerging in the West? which is nothing but social equality and looking at the ecosystem as a whole!? wow!This very moral high handedness, Orientalist fascination and falsification is what makes him and unfortunately very many great writers and speakers nothing but closet idiots posing as revolutionary change makers in this World. Fritjof Capra writes about risking his career and his future writing this book. Well, it looks like he had taken care of it ever since. The mind of a physicist still deserves stars and there go the three stars."
57,1570625190,http://goodreads.com/user/show/88087493-christopher-miller,2,"Long ago, I saw this mentioned in three other books I was reading. I happened across it at a used book store while visiting my home town and picked it up. Later that very night, hanging out with my friends and their dad, he said ""I read this book forever ago, and it blew my mind. The Tao of Physics."" That has always been the most interesting thing about this book to me.Is there any intrinsic merit? I've been waiting to revisit this one, since I didn't make it very far into Web of Life at all. It's been on favorites shelf for years, unquestioned. My recollection is of a really dry read that nonetheless left me feeling excited, or at least validated. If I were to sum the book up in a sentence, it would be: As subatomic particles are dissected into quanta, we see that all matter is energy, therefore all sages in history are proven right about the world being spiritual in nature. I don't feel like I'm doing it any injustice.I was reading a lot of physics and Eastern philosophy at the time, so I can say both are fairly represented here (based on my other readings anyway). The presentation is probably inferior to a book focused on either subject. It's not bad as introductory material if that's all you have available.The connection between the two does not convince. Assertions are not arguments. I feel like the subject is useless anyway. I lump it in with questions like free will and hard solipsism. Suppose all this is true, so what? Should I start behaving any differently? My keyboard might be nothing more than a bunch of vibrating packets of energy, I think it makes sense to still conceptualize and interact with it as if it were solid.To someone curious about reality, I would recommend Carl Sagan's ""The Demon Haunted World."" To those who are really blown away by Capra's arguments, I would also recommend reading it, then reading Tao of Physics again. It's a much more palatable read, as well."
58,1570625190,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43368011-robert,2,"Good:- Discussion of models, intuition, interpretations and non-linear thinking in science- Introduction into some aspects of eastern philosophies and thinkingBad:- Comparison between particle physics and eastern thought varies from superficial to ridiculously far-fetched- Excessive repetition of nebulous thoughts and unclear conclusionsCapra's book hits the zeitgeist of the 70s and the “New Age” movement drawing attention to the spiritual side of the human nature, makes a case for nothing less than a deep connection of modern physics and eastern mysticism, but turns out in the end to be just hot air.In the first chapters Capra explains the scientific method based on experiments and the elaboration of mathematical models. These models are limited by design – since their objective is precisely to simplify predictions – but should never be confused with reality itself (“Because our representation of reality is so much easier to grasp than reality itself, we tend to confuse the two and to take our concepts and symbols for reality.”) These explanations combined with remarks about the role of intuition and the difficulties of switching between results of the models and their interpretations are at least useful for non-scientists in order to understand how scientists work. In the next chapters Capra gives a brief introduction into different branches of eastern thought: Hinduism, Buddhism, Chinese thought, Taoism and Zen.In the main part of the book Capra then tries to show the parallels between the world of physics and the world of mysticism. The pattern is typically the explanation of some observations of particle physics which are different from the observations in classical physics and mechanics, and then presenting elements of eastern mysticism that show some similarity. While the physical phenomena are reasonably well explained due to Capra's scientific background, the parallels to eastern mysticism vary from superficial to ridiculously far-fetched. Capra does make a great effort of cherry-picking paragraphs written by scientists and comparing them with quotations of eastern thought, but in most cases these comparisons don't even qualify as anecdotic “evidence”.In the end it never gets clear why this comparison should be beneficial beyond the advantages of opening your mental horizon in general. It is probably typical for an esoteric book that it hints to deeper insights without being able to explain them, a mystical experience after all. And after 300 pages of talking about the alleged deep connections of science and mysticism Capra himself comes to the conclusion “Science does not need mysticism and mysticism does not need science; but man needs both.”"
59,1570625190,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57872597-rahul,5,"The book titled ""the tao o Physics"" written by a Physicist Fritjof Capra presents a great parallelism between modern physics and Eastern Mysticism. As told by the author in Preface, this idea came to him after he experienced himself the gigantic cosmic dance of and ware of whole environment. The author presents deep connection and analogue between the concepts of recently discovered modern physics and thousand years old literature of Eastern mysticism. The books presents the parallelism of physicist concepts in most possible non-technical way to mystical literatures of the East. Some quotes from the book:All the changes in the world derive, arise from the interplay of opposites, its the dynamic and cyclic interplay of the contrary, one should not see them as pair of opposites but as unity, the unity which contains and transcends all opposing forces, the unity which is right word for this metaphor, the opposites make a unity - Peace and war, love and hate, food and hungry makes one united truth. Descartes famous sentence - Cogito ergo sum - I think therefore I exist has led the western an to equate his identity with his mind detached form his body, disintegrated into bodies and mind. Most individuals are aware of themselves as isolated egos existing inside their bodies, the mind has been separated form the bodies and has been given task to control it, this causing an apparent conflict between conscious will and involuntary instincts. When the mind is disturbed multiplicity of things is produced when mind is at peace, the multiplicity of thing dissappears. "
