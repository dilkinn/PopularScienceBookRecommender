1,0470861711,http://goodreads.com/user/show/105482-ari,4,"Maxwell was perhaps the greatest physicist of the 19th century. Every civilized person should know that he formulated the (relativistically-correct!) field equations for electromagnetism. What I hadn't realized was that he practically had to invent vector calculus himself -- ""div, grad, curl and all that' are substantially Maxwell's handiwork. He also made huge contributions to statistical mechanics and many other fields -- he showed that Saturn's rings could only be stable if they were composed of small solid particles, instead of being liquid or solid. He also was the first person to really understand the color well enough to explain why there are different primary colors for pigment and light. The part that was interesting about the book, though, was the portrayal of Maxwell the man. Unlike many scientists, he was a thoroughly admirable person -- ""a perfect Christian gentleman"" as his contemporaries put it. Friendly, thoughtful, caring, literary, and the object of near-universal admiration.He had a long correspondence by postcard with two other Scottish physicists (Tait and William Thompson). Thomson was T, Tait was T', and some other scientist they didn't respect was T'' --because he was a second-order quantity. Apparently nerd humor has not improved with time."
2,0470861711,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54723154-mike-bruce,5,"As the author admits, James Clerk Maxwell deserves to be recognized in the pantheon of Newton and Einstein. Newton unified all theories of mechanics (eg. Copernicus, Galileo, Kepler, etc); Maxwell unified all theories of electricity, magnetism and optics (eg. Faraday, Gauss, Ampere, Coulomb, etc). No small feat since it involved the novel concept of the “field” (now the basis for all fundamental theories), as first suggested by Faraday. Einstein, of course, was Einstein. His theory (known as “Maxwell’s Equations”) predicted light was an electromagnetic wave as well as the existence of other invisible waves in empty space like xrays, radio frequencies (RF; the basis of all “wifi”) and microwaves (but don’t blame him for the “microwave oven” ;)---even Maxwell had a hard time believing they might be real. The equations also strongly presaged Relativity---the speed of light was independent of inertial frame, which was a key clue for Einstein and his Theory of Special Relativity.In addition to the aforementioned, he founded statistical mechanics (and came eerily close to quantum mechanics, before it was accepted that “atoms” exist), theory of color vision, and the renowned Cavendish Laboratory; his Treatise “Electricity and Magnetism” stands with Newton’s “Principia” as one of the most profound books in the history of physics. Not to mention that he was a great human being: he was loved by his students, always humble and generous, loved animals, and was “a most perfect example of a Christian gentleman”. I was already familiar with his science, I read this mainly to understand his creative process better and get to know Maxwell the person. In that I was not disappointed.As the author states: what is “more remarkable is that he is so little known to the public. Everyone has heard of Newton and Einstein but Maxwell is almost unknown outside professional circles”. Without his “Maxwell’s Equations”, modern physics and technology would not exist. He indeed “changed everything”."
3,0470861711,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5719671-frank-peters,3,"Maxwell is probably as close to a hero as any man who has ever lived. Thus, from my perspective, any accurate biography of Maxwell deserves five stars merely for content. This book ably presents a short history of the great man. However, I am disappointed by the way in which the book was written. The author has chosen to follow the secularist agenda (as can be guessed since the book was recommended by the magazine – New Scientist), by relegating anything religious or spiritual to the irrelevant/private sphere. Thirty years ago, I read several biographies of Maxwell and was struck by (and encouraged by) his life that incorporated both his science and his Christianity in balance, something that I have endeavoured to do myself. Unlike many at his time, Maxwell refused to get sucked into the science vs faith controversies that appears following Darwin, and as this book pointed out was a friendly associate of Huxley. He believed that neither could operate without the other. Note also, that my assertion is very evident from a simple internet search. Getting back to this book: all aspects of Maxwell’s faith were downplayed as being irrelevant to the story. And this, I believe, misrepresents James Clerk Maxwell. "
4,0470861711,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30541335-jimmy-ele,4,Nice little biography. Doesn't ever get too technical about Maxwell's work. Gives you a good overview of his contributions to science. 
5,0470861711,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5458693-ricardo-guerreiro,5,"I mean, read this book, whoever you are, what ever you do. The man, the (victorian) times, the things that were happening, the intellectual challenges and the beauty of the then found solutions or at least the attempts to find them, and as it all came together to be one of most interesting episodes in human history, portrayed in the life of James Clerk Maxwell made this, one of the most pleasing books to ever have crossed my eyes. The best part is to find a most generous, interested and interesting personality behind it all. I mean, read this book... [I didn't tell you that Maxwell is a longtime personal hero of mine. But I would do the same review had the book been about William Thomson or Oliver Heaviside. Not my fault that Maxwell was The Man and the book is about him (=]"
6,0470861711,http://goodreads.com/user/show/922754-camille,5,I got this book for Christmas and loved it. It's amazing to read about how much of our current understanding of science we owe to this incredible man.
7,0470861711,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9381908-divya-pal-singh,5,"The normally irascible Isaac Newton remarked in 1676 …….. If I have seen further it is by standing on the sholders [sic] of Giants. In turn, Einstein, when told that he had done great things because he stood on Newton's shoulders; Einstein replied: No I don't. I stand on the shoulders of Maxwell.The influence of James Clerk Maxwell runs all through our daily lives. His electromagnetic waves made possible ALL forms of wireless communication. Colour TV and mobile phone screens work on the three-colour principle that he demonstrated. Pilots and astronauts fly their craft by control systems which derive from his work. Bridges and other structures were designed using his reciprocal diagrams and photoelastic techniques.Maxwell started a revolution in the way physicists look at the world. He introduced statistical methods in physics. His droll molecule sized creature, Maxwell’s Demon, was the first example of the thought experiment so frequently used by Einstein and memorably by Schrodinger with his famously lamentable cat. At Cambridge he set up the Cavendish Lab where the electron and the atomic structure were discovered by Thomson and Rutherford later on. His discoveries helped usher in the era of modern physics, laying the foundation for such fields as special relativity and quantum mechanics. Many physicists regard Maxwell as the 19th-century scientist having the greatest influence on 20th-century physics. His contributions to the science are considered by many to be of the same magnitude as those of Isaac Newton and Albert Einstein. In the millennium poll—a survey of the 100 most prominent physicists—Maxwell was voted the third greatest physicist of all time, behind only Newton and Einstein. On the centenary of Maxwell's birthday, Einstein described Maxwell's work as the most profound and the most fruitful that physics has experienced since the time of Newton.Maxwell's A Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism: Vol. 2 is probably, after Newton'sThe Principia: Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy, the most renowned book in the history of physics. It is said that if you trace every line of modern physical research to its starting point you come back to Maxwell.Maxwell achieved all this in a short span of life – he died at the age of 48.So why is he not as well-known as Newton and Einstein or even Schrodinger, Planck or Bohr? Apparently he was painfully modest (laid back in today's argot) and never strove to promote his work; nor was there anyone who did it for him. Most importantly many of his ideas were way ahead of their time. Physicists recognized his work later, once experimental proof became available.An engrossing book indeed."
8,0470861711,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32969530-dick-heimbold,4,"I get a kick out of learning how human knowledge evolves. Particularly scientific knowledge. This biography by Basil Mahon gave me the level of biographical detail that I like for a person that made contributions is so many areas. It was not overloaded with math, nor with detail about Maxwell’s personal life, making for a fairly short biography presenting a compact description of the his many accomplishments. There is little math notation in the book but his wave equations were presented for the reader to see their simplicity and elegance. There is much discussion of the interrelationships of other scientist’s findings with Maxwell’s thinking and Maxwell’s profound influence on the scientific advances surging ahead by leaps and bounds. Maxwell built many mechanical models to demonstrate his concepts. His leadership of the Cavandish laboratory at Cambridge resulted in its resurgence and opened the door for the great Earnest Rutherford to follow in that installation in the tradition of experimentation using models. Maxwell also applied mathematical techniques. Perhaps the best known is his works on electromagnetic waves and how his equations defined basic properties of light—opening the door for Einstein to define the relation of mass to energy with the simple equation, e=mc2.A theme that runs through the book is how little recognition Maxwell received for his work, in comparison with Einstein, Newton, and Darwin. Maxwell’s contributions were of the quality of these Olympian scientists. He wrote papers and books of a scientific nature but was a humble person who did not seek publicity. He was busy with many things such as managing his large Scottish estate, and contributing to the religious and educational life of his community. His energetic life came to an early end at age forty eight because of stomach cancer. By all accounts he lead a well-ordered, busy life that Mahon portrays in a young-adult, always-admiring style that I felt lacked the gravitas of a major biography. For example: he refers to Maxwell as “James.” Also the book would have benefited by a good copy edit to get rid of numerous small errors. On the other hand the Notes at the end of the book were an added benefit for the serious science reader. I rated it four stars for presenting what I was looking for: clear definition of Maxwell's powerful impact on the evolution of science. "
9,0470861711,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19679197-karla-fox,5,"A thorough gentleman.Basil Mahon Quotes""People who knew Maxwell have left us with more than his scientific achievements. We have a picture of a man who was the kind of friend everyone would love to have: generous, considerate, brave, genial, entertaining and entirely without vanity or pretense. The friend who knew him best described his character having ""A grand simplicity"": he was the same all the way through and the same to everyone.James own reflections on his life were typically self-effacing. ""What is done by what I call myself is, I feel, done my something greater than myself in me.I have been thinking how very gently i have been dealt with. I have never had a violent shove in all my life. The only desire which i can have is like David to serve my own generation by the will of god, and then fall asleep."""
10,0470861711,http://goodreads.com/user/show/84826805-aiman-adlawan,4,I like physics and I am so fascinated about Maxwell's contributions and discoveries. His undying thirst for knowledge and understanding how things work made him such an icon in the world of physics and math. One of the stories told in this book was that he spent lengthy hours reading books and other resources for him to gather all knowledge and assemble them in pieces. It really needs hard work and effect to achieve something. His story is so amazing. Very inspiring. Great book. Its an easy read. 
11,0470861711,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11066575-madhav-sinha,4,"The great genius, Maxwell, still doesn't get his due!Maxwell is wellknown to students of science, but not quite a fashionable name to be dropped in social circles. This book tries to tell us how great he was and why he should be as widely name-dropped as Newton/Einstein/Hawking etc.Though the book is thoroughly enjoyable (finished reading it in 3 suitings, great!), It hasn't the mettle to become a bestseller.Let somebody write a bestseller on Maxwell! Please!"
12,0470861711,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36730348-william-v-meyer,5,"Worth readingWell researched and written. Worth reading. The Kindle version could be more carefully transcribed, small editing concerns like: all the * comments throughout the book are collected at the end on sequential pages that are not numbered, the fonts change in the middle of words, many dates contain spaces in the middle of the number for the year ...; minor publishing blemishes in a book that deserves better."
13,0470861711,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42345499,5,"A neat insight on the life of Sir James Maxwell, the scientist who revolutionized the way we observe the physical world with his creative interpretations and imaginative thinking.This book focuses on two cornerstones of James life:His scientific personality, as well as his personal life as a real gentleman with a loving personality and utmost kindness.I recommend it to everyone."
14,0470861711,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6513898-jack,5,Short little book but very engaging. I was very fascinated with the mechanical analogy that Maxwell used to visualize electromagnetic waves. Wish they had taught me that in my freshman physics classes.
15,0470861711,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17539257-curtis-penner,3,"Mostly the book was physically difficult to read. Wiley did not do the reader any favor in the manner in which it was bound. Mr. Mahon was very vague about the state of physics in Europe at the time of Maxwell’s work. Beyond that, it is a fair book."
16,0470861711,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5678847-nathan,4,"Great biography of an amazing scientist. Approachable, but also described Maxwell's discoveries and scientific thought process in a satisfying manner."
17,0470861711,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30105829-jimbob,5,Excellent short biography. It discusses Maxwell's large range of interests in both the maths and physics in sufficient detail for me to understand them. I will read this again.

19,0470861711,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91770179-edu,5,A great portrait of the (probably) most influential physicist of the 19th century. 
20,0470861711,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26388542-jenny-hunt,4,"I couldn’t understand all the maths and physics, but a good biography and interesting to see all the things he contributed to bit others are famous for."
21,0470861711,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65271251-justin-bintz,5,"My interest was sparked about James Clerk Maxwell from a passage in the Daemon haunted World by Carl Sagan and I couldn't resist learning more about the father of the modern age of science. Basil not only delivered comprehensive information about all of the pivotal life events of James but delved deeper into the equations and theorems Maxwell worked on than I had expected. It prompted me to research and learn more about the work he did than if he had just glazed over them. I believe this to be an ode to Maxwell's way of learning and teaching. He thoroughly believed you have to get your hands dirty, understand the path that lead to the final elegant equation or theorem or you are merely regurgitating rubbish. I've been inspired through Basil's work to further investigate the Cavendish research lab Maxwell designed and the discovery of the electron. "
22,0470861711,http://goodreads.com/user/show/101276136-peter,3,"A great subject in JCM but somehow this book didn't reach me; I will await a better biography and try again. The author, Basil Mahon, is a clever guy but maybe he is not the man to take on the biography of this fascinating scientific innovator, it is not written in a style that sustains the readers interest. Einstein had a picture of JCM on his study wall and said that he stood on the shoulders of this man and his innovations but the astounding and highly complex achievements of Maxwell should be a captivating read, sadly not here."
23,0470861711,http://goodreads.com/user/show/108411669-edd-marbello-santrich,5,"This guy, was one the most brilliant physicist that have borned. If we would have had a little bit of press, or living in the twentiest century, we woul be talking about one world star. His contributions in electricity and magnetism, are the most relevant. However, James' work on Statistical Mechanics, The Satrun's rings and optics, show us the power of a mind with a deep reasoning and power. It is necessary to say, he wasn't a good teacher as well. But, when we are talking about of the angular stones of physics, there is no doubt that optiks and electromagnetism unification, is one of them. "
24,0470861711,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3157958-joseph,4,"A concise history of the works and influence of James Clerk Maxwell. Without being overly scientific it puts into context the huge leaps made by Maxwell. At the same time it is a biography, and it is a little to enamoured of Maxwell to be a real look at his life. Too much of a love in. There is definitely something to his relationships which is glossed over. Maybe someone else will write a psychological biography. This book does what it says on the cover so it can't be faulted for that."
25,0470861711,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16925777-ali,2,"Read this book for English. Found it incredibly boring. But it's short. And Maxwell truly did have an extraordinary mind, and is a perfect example of a Maker. And if you don't take my English class you probably have no idea what I'm talking about. Anyway, read this book if you're into science, particularly electromagnetism. But if you're bored by that kind of thing, I suggest not reading this one. "
26,0470861711,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20061877-laura-anne,4,"Should have a name as recognizable as Einstein or Newton. Most of the book is easy to understand. Almost all of our current technologies rests on an understanding of the electro magnetic spectrum - telephones, internet, television, radio, and on and on. The natural curiosity of people in an earlier time is amazing. I guess the masses mostly sit around getting their daily dose of media these days instead."
27,0470861711,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13741690-sylph-r,3,"For the scientific minds, this book is an interesting journey into the life and mind of James Clerk Maxwell, the man who unified electricity, light and magnetism into ONE single equation and change everything!You won't get the details of the maths though, if that is what you wanted to know. Otherwise it tells you how Maxwell's mathematical ingenuity along with Faraday's experiments allowed him to find that illumination of light = magnetism = electricity."
28,0470861711,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32046266-adam,3,"I know it's an autobiography, but it's got more physics in it than the general reader would like. Some of the author's descriptions are very hard to follow because he often writes in a convoluted manner. He also has a superfluous number of footnotes, where information that would be absolutely fine (and helpful) in the main text is not present there, so you have to waste time referring to them.Other than that you'll learn just how much more important Maxwell ought to be to us all."
29,0470861711,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5935582-dan-cohen,3,"A solid and enjoyable introductory biography of a strangely neglected great scientist. It's an easy read and it gets the balance right between the human and scientific sides of its' subject. I wouldn't say it was the most exciting book to read and the author's style is not particularly interesting, hence just 3 stars, but I would recommend the book because of how important the subject was (and it helps that he seems to have been such a decent individual)."

Scotland should be proud of this unsung hero who contributed so much to the fund of scientific knowledge in a multitude of areas. The book will not appeal to people with no interest in science, even though the maths and scientific theories are only superficially covered."
166,0470861711,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15016354-alan-fricker,3,This book was a gift from my manager in my first professional post and has been sat on the to read pile for some time. The link to my present employer temoted me to finally read it. The book is a straight forward run through of the life of a remarkable man. The gift reflected one of my managers many passions.

Not too technical, accessible for the non-scientific reader to learn about Maxwell's incredible contributions to physics. Not much has been written about Maxwell, so it was nice to gain some insight into his personality and personal life. "

182,0470861711,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17253228-kenv98223,4,"Brilliant scientific mind, yet so personally unassuming as to be far less well known than many of his contemporaries who actually contributed far less. The mid-1800's was the era when technology really began to blossom, and Maxwell was in the midst of it all, laying the foundation for everything from harnessing radio waves to understanding how gasses behaved. Fascinating period of history. "
