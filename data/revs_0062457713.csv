0,0062457713,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11626803-val-shameless-non-snowflake,3,"If you follow my reviews/blog at all, you probably already know that I am already a zero fucks given kind of gal when it comes to, well, bullshit.In fact, my best friend had the below picture as my contact photo in his phone for years.So it should come as no surprise that I, like many, was drawn to this book, 1) Because it has the word ""fuck"" in the title. Duh. And, 2) Because it's bright fucking orange. That said, the chum was in the water for me already based on that alone. But when I got to this:I knew this book and I would be friends. I am SO anti-participation trophy it's ridiculous. And, no, I don't care if that offends all the middle class helicopter moms and their special snowflakes. Your kid needs to learn how to lose.That's how character is built, my friends.And that's pretty much one of the major points in this book actually.That and, simply put, prioritizing where you put your emotional energy aka your fucks. Stuff I have a solid a handle on already. But, full transparency, I read this out of curiosity and with a slim to none expectation of there being anything life changing to take away from it.Don't get me wrong, color me surprised, I thought this book made a lot of solid points.Some really good, well articulated ones actually. I definitely do think this book has something to offer.For example, it reminded me that I need to stop hoping my sister and I form a BFF Sweet Valley High-esque sister friendship and accept the fact that we are 35+ fucking years old and it's just not gonna happen.And that's okay. She only texts me when she wants or needs something and, while we love and respect each other - we just aren't all THAT. And that's okay. As I said, it made good points - none of which the author attempted to claim creating - he just wrote it down in an easy, witty, sometimes offensive and conversational fashion with examples of his own life and personal epiphanies. It did get a little ridiculous sometimes with how much he referred to his former ""bangs all the ladies"" behavior. We get it, you are a walking dream machine. *eye roll*It also contradicted itself a bit in some areas, though nothing detrimental in my eyes. He also definitely walked a fine line when discussing certain issues as they pertain to women.Feminists and just some women in general will NOT appreciate this book. Not gonna lie though, right or wrong, this book definitely appealed to my snarky, crass kind of humor, reminding me once again that I apparently have the personality and sense of humor of a dude. But whatevers.That's not a fuck I care to give, apparently."
1,0062457713,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21493936-clumsy-storyteller,5,"Masterpiece, incredibly funny. i don't usally go for self help books cause to me they are all the same! Smile more, love more, hate less, don't give up, it's gonna be okay, it's all in your head. Blah blah blah.... but this one was the exception. Anything with curse words on the cover picks my interest :P The first half of it was my favorite, the aim of this book is to help the reader to think a little bit more clearly about what they’re choosing to find important in life and what they’re choosing to find unimportant.These are few of my favrite quotes in this book:The desire for more positive experience is itself a negative experience. And, paradoxically, the acceptance of one’s negative experience is itself a positive experience.Self-improvement and success often occur together. But that doesn’t necessarily mean they’re the same thing.Our culture today is obsessively focused on unrealistically positive expectations: Be happier. Be healthier. Be the best, better than the rest. Be smarter, faster, richer, sexier, more popular, more productive, more envied, and more admired. Be perfect and amazing and crap out twelve-karat-gold nuggets before breakfast each morning while kissing your selfie-ready spouse and two and a half kids goodbye. Then fly your helicopter to your wonderfully fulfilling job, where you spend your days doing incredibly meaningful work that’s likely to save the planet one day. Ironically, this fixation on the positive—on what’s better, what’s superior—only serves to remind us over and over again of what we are not, of what we lack, of what we should have been but failed to be. After all, no truly happy person feels the need to stand in front of a mirror and recite that she’s happy. She just is.Everyone and their TV commercial wants you to believe that the key to a good life is a nicer job, or a more rugged car, or a prettier girlfriend, or a hot tub with an inflatable pool for the kids. The world is constantly telling you that the path to a better life is more, more, more—buy more, own more, make more, fuck more, be more. You are constantly bombarded with messages to give a fuck about everything, all the time. Give a fuck about a new TV. Give a fuck about having a better vacation than your coworkers. Give a fuck about buying that new lawn ornament. Give a fuck about having the right kind of selfie stick.The Feedback Loop from HellThere’s an insidious quirk to your brain that, if you let it, can drive you absolutely batty. Tell me if this sounds familiar to you: You get anxious about confronting somebody in your life. That anxiety cripples you and you start wondering why you’re so anxious. Now you’re becoming anxious about being anxious. Oh no! Doubly anxious! Now you’re anxious about your anxiety, which is causing more anxiety. Quick, where’s the whiskey?"
2,0062457713,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1037413-libbyscreen,1,"I'm not actually done yet, but this book is becoming more problematic by the page. In re: false memories and page 128: False memories are absolutely a thing. But when the example you use to illustrate this fact is a 1980's feminist who falsely accused her father of abuse and you follow up with ""in the early 1980s and 1990s hundreds of innocent people were wrongly accused of sexual violence under similar circumstances. Many of them went to prison for it"" you are being supremely irresponsible. The casual reader who is not familiar with sexual violence and rape and abuse could easily walk away with the impression that survivors of sexual assault often make up their assault. This is utterly, utterly untrue - we know that rape and incest are some of the most under reported and under prosecuted crimes, and that the possibility of not being believed plays a big role in that.***Finally finished. One star. You don't need to read this book. "

It's a very surface level look at Stoicism and western Buddhism aimed at dudebros. It still has some good things to say, but it's got so many problems that I don't even want to get into it, I just want to distance myself from it at this point and apologize for recommending it.I would suggest Why Buddhism is True and The Practicing Stoic instead as much better books to read that cover the same ground more in depth, without any of the negatives."
4,0062457713,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15987292-mary-monaghan,2,"I started out liking this book, I really did. By the time I was halfway in, his smug attitude about things he frankly knows jack shit about were getting on my nerves. He made some excellent points, all of which have been made countless times by other, more competent writers. Read Sartre, Camus, Siddhartha by Herman Hesse, and various Buddhist texts instead. Regurgitating Eastern philosophy and existentialism while swearing a lot only gets you so far. I stopped reading and returned this book."

8,0062457713,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3183871-jaclyn-salem,1,"I knew after the first chapter that I probably wasn't the intended audience for this book. Most of it was sort of a ""duh"" for me, but I continued on in hopes I would learn something new...WOW, this author is SO self-indulgent. He misses no opportunity to remind us about what a complete ""fuckboi"" he was in his twenties. The problem with this is that his tone (and the fact that he brings it up over and over and over and over again) makes it sound like it is almost a point of pride rather than something to be remorseful about. There are a lot of (re-packaged Buddhist and psych) truth nuggets in here, but they're definitely mired in a lot of privileged bullshit. "
9,0062457713,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28323108-a-rather-bookish,1,"Has anybody been unfortunate enough to be sitting in a pub/restaurant, enjoying the ambience and possibly a meal, and out of nowhere, a rather drunk individual parks himself beside you, grinning profusely, and then just doesn't stop talking about his life, your life and everything HE thinks that you should be doing, but without any solid proof to back himself up? I have, and this book by Mark Manson made me feel like I was back in that pub, but with an even dodgier individual attempting to give me life lessons. Seeing this book for the first time, I'll admit, I was pretty revved up about reading it. I mean, lets be honest, a bright orange cover with ""The subtle art of not giving a fu*k"" boldly plastered on it, you can hardly miss it. The book began with an introduction, which made me feel like this was was going to be a truly life changing read. Well, from the words ""Chapter one"" it all took a swift nose dive. Manson began the first few chapters with a lot of ""Fuck this, fuck that, fuck you"" kind of attitude. I can take cursing, but this, was kind of tiring. This was like listening to a young person that has just discovered the art of cursing. It sucked. There were some interesting points, but you need to dig deep to find them. I found that this book had mostly opinions, with a few hidden facts chucked in for good measure. I cannot understand how Romeo and Juliet could be brought into this book, then a couple of pages later, Buddhism, and then many fucks later, he is telling us that HE is amazing, as he has the audacity to inform his wife when she looks shitty, and, best of all, apparently she loves that. I just don't buy it.For me, this book is just a preachy retelling of stuff we already know, written by an average male and, I'm still trying to understand what possessed me to spend actual money on this! Absolutely no fucks given."
10,0062457713,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2986658-jen,2,"Based on the title, I was pretty stoked for this, and the introductory essay explaining the author's Not Giving a F*ck theory made a lot of sense to me and made me really happy. Essentially, he says that the internet and the media demand that we give a f*ck about everything, but we only have so much time on Earth and so many f*cks to give and we have to choose who and what we spend those f*cks on. Makes sense.Unfortunately, the rest of the book turns into the same self-help drivel you see in any other ""how to be happy"" kind of book, only Manson starts to present the information with a tone reminiscent of an Andrew Dice Clay routine. No bueno. I ended up having to bail."
11,0062457713,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1642452-kenny,1,"“Giving too many fucks is bad for you.”The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck, Mark MansonWhere to begin? Well for starters, Mark Manson is a real douche. There has never been a better husband than Mark Manson. Why? He doesn't put up with bullshit. If his wife looks like shit he tells her. He won't tolerate her looking bad no matter how much time she has spent getting ready to go out. And we must take note of how edgy Manson is. He actually figured out you can remove the word care and replace it with fuck. WOW! How profound! What he really means in the quote above is caring too much is bad for you. Oh, let's not forget how he loves to give added emphasis to things. When talking about music, it's not enough to reference The Beatles, they are the The GODDAMN Beatles. What Manson has done here is dust off some older self-help philosophies, replace as many words as possible with FUCK and tried to make it look shiny, new and innovative. It's not. Manson proudly announces he cuts through the crap! But alas, he does not. What Manson really does is steal some ideas from Buddhism and works hard to make himself look like a wise philosopher, and old soul. There are only so many things we can care about so we need to figure out which ones really matter ~~ sorry ~~ There are only so many things we can give a fuck about so we need to figure out which ones really matter. Or how about this gem: ""While money is nice, caring about what you do with your life is better, because true wealth is about experience."" Wow! While Manson pats himself on the back for this gem, I can't help but think of Emerson, “Its the not the Destination, It's the journey.” Thankfully, Manson brilliantly improves on Emerson and makes himself so much more profound in this generation-defining self-help guide. Most of Manson's observations make me roll my eyes, or at times, laugh out loud. How did we survive as a society without Mark Manson?Manson has a new book coming out in May. Maybe I'll read it, but probably not, because honestly, I just don't give a fuck ..."
12,0062457713,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42631934-pat,1,"you think you're getting a light, irreverent lifestyle/self-help book, but then it's actually just a few good ideas taken from Buddhism and then mixed in with conservative nonsense about ""snowflakes,"" mixed with some casual misogyny and backdoor bragging. A book only a white straight man with rich parents could write."
13,0062457713,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32799998-erin,1,"I don't read self-help. I simply don't believe in the self-help genre. If you need a book to help you live your life you have bigger problems than whatever brought you to that book. That may seem harsh but its just my opinion and you are free to ignore it.Since I don't read self-help, you may be asking ""Erin, Why did you read this book? Blame Popsugar. I'm doing the Popsugar 2017 Reading challenge and needed to read a book from a genre I don't usually read. As you can see if you look at my book shelf I pretty much read every genre. So I narrowed it down to 3 genres: Self-help, Christian, or Amish Romance. I picked Self-help. Mark Manson is proof that anyone can get a book deal. I understand that he has a very popular blog and publishing is about money but God this book is bad. I found myself speed reading it just so it would end. Mark Manson is shallow, smug, and completely uninformed about everything that he was trying to talk about. You know what I don't give a fuck about? This book. DON'T READ IT. AVOID AT ALL COST! Popsugar 2017 Reading Challenge: Bestseller from a Genre I Don't Normally Read."
14,0062457713,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1720620-anne,3,"My, my! What a catchy title!I wanted to see what all the hype was about, so I picked this up. And now that I'm done? Well, I agree with everything Manson says, but (like other reviewers have mentioned) everything he's written about is common sense stuff. Is that revolutionary?Maybe.What does it say about our society in general that any of what he's saying is...well, remotely necessary to say!?When the basic premise of a bestseller is that you should stop comparing yourself to what you see on television, movies, and social media, and just be content to be the best version of yourself - and scads of people find this to be awe-inspiring? Then perhaps it really did need to be said.The gist of this ""groundbreaking"" book is that there's no way to insulate yourself from bad times, and even if you could, those hardships are what make us better people. One of the biggest problems we seem to have is this nonsensical idea that chasing happiness is a worthwhile goal. I mean, it sounds great on paper, but it's not in any way, shape, or form realisitc...or healthy. Life will not give you a happy ending. Period. Endings are always sad. And we need to get over this ridiculous idea that at some point we'll get to sigh a big sigh of relief because our fairytale Happily Ever After has arrived.We can all save ourselves the trouble of trying to find happiness by just realizing that we need to choose to be happy now. Enjoy the small stuff, my friends, because tomorrow might just suck a giant dick. Your life will be good until it isn't. You'll be in love until you aren't. Your job will be fulfilling until you lose it. You'll be alive until you're dead. And nothing you do will change that.Ok, granted, that doesn't sound awesome.But the point is, if you stop trying to live for some future Happiness High, prioritize what means the most to you now, and live with a fearless attitude towards the future? Then you're going to be much more content (and yes, happy) than someone who is constantly trying to measure up to unrealistic goals they've set in order achieve a sense of fulfillment.The end.The book itself is fairly short and Manson's voice isn't terribly annoying.Read it or not. I don't give a fuck."
15,0062457713,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23381142-nat,4,"I went into this admittedly with quite some skepticism and entitlement— “what is this going to teach me that I don’t already know?”— but The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck is truly one of the most ground-shaping nonfiction books I’ve read so far. It will and can change a perspective, a life. And as such, this is the perfect book to give to your loved ones on holidays, birthdays...It made me rethink all the times I ever gave a fuck over some of the most irrelevant things in hindsight. It made me realize that it’s sometimes necessary to take a step back and re-evaluate why I think so-and-so on a daily basis.I also wrote down a lot of Mark Manson’s writing into my notes because I knew I would need it in the near future. And I would like to thank him for answering quite a lot of fears of mine with such a dose of raw, refreshing, honest truth.The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck was both personally relevant and entertaining.Here are a few pieces that helped me and then some:“The key to a good life is not giving a fuck about more; it’s giving a fuck about less, giving a fuck about only what is true and immediate and important.”“Because when you give too many fucks—when you give a fuck about everyone and everything—you will feel that you’re perpetually entitled to be comfortable and happy at all times, that everything is supposed to be just exactly the fucking way you want it to be. This is a sickness. And it will eat you alive. You will see every adversity as an injustice, every challenge as a failure, every inconvenience as a personal slight, every disagreement as a betrayal. You will be confined to your own petty, skull-sized hell, burning with entitlement and bluster, running circles around your very own personal Feedback Loop from Hell, in constant motion yet arriving nowhere”YES! This is exactly how I feel when I give too many fucks about things that have little lasting impact on my life.“Life is essentially an endless series of problems, Mark,” the panda told me. He sipped his drink and adjusted the little pink umbrella. “The solution to one problem is merely the creation of the next one.”A moment passed, and then I wondered where the fuck the talking panda came from. And while we’re at it, who made these margaritas?“Don’t hope for a life without problems,” the panda said. “There’s no such thing. Instead, hope for a life full of good problems.”Disappointment Panda was one of the best additions to this book.“Who you are is defined by what you’re willing to struggle for. People who enjoy the struggles of a gym are the ones who run triathlons and have chiseled abs and can bench-press a small house. People who enjoy long workweeks and the politics of the corporate ladder are the ones who fly to the top of it. People who enjoy the stresses and uncertainties of the starving artist lifestyle are ultimately the ones who live it and make it.This is not about willpower or grit. This is not another admonishment of “no pain, no gain.” This is the most simple and basic component of life: our struggles determine our successes. Our problems birth our happiness, along with slightly better, slightly upgraded problems.See: it’s a never-ending upward spiral. And if you think at any point you’re allowed to stop climbing, I’m afraid you’re missing the point. Because the joy is in the climb itself.”This book is slowly but surely shifting my world.“If you want to change how you see your problems, you have to change what you value and/or how you measure failure/success.”“Honesty is a good value because it’s something you have complete control over, it reflects reality, and it benefits others (even if it’s sometimes unpleasant). Popularity, on the other hand, is a bad value. If that’s your value, and if your metric is being the most popular guy/girl at the dance party, much of what happens will be out of your control: you don’t know who else will be at the event, and you probably won’t know who half those people are. Second, the value/metric isn’t based on reality: you may feel popular or unpopular, when in fact you have no fucking clue what anybody else really thinks about you. (Side Note: As a rule, people who are terrified of what others think about them are actually terrified of all the shitty things they think about themselves being reflected back at them.)”That side note is speaking the truth!!!“I’m not saying that this excused what my ex did—not at all. But recognizing my mistakes helped me to realize that I perhaps hadn’t been the innocent victim I’d believed myself to be. That I had a role to play in enabling the shitty relationship to continue for as long as it did. After all, people who date each other tend to have similar values. And if I dated someone with shitty values for that long, what did that say about me and my values? I learned the hard way that if the people in your relationships are selfish and doing hurtful things, it’s likely you are too, you just don’t realize it.”Taking responsibly for your actions, but not blaming yourself was one of the most valuable lessons I got from Mark Manson.“A lot of people might hear all of this and then say something like, “Okay, but how? I get that my values suck and that I avoid responsibility for all of my problems and that I’m an entitled little shit who thinks the world should revolve around me and every inconvenience I experience—but how do I change?”And to this I say, in my best Yoda impersonation: “Do, or do not; there is no ‘how.’ ”You are already choosing, in every moment of every day, what to give a fuck about, so change is as simple as choosing to give a fuck about something else.It really is that simple. It’s just not easy.It’s not easy because you’re going to feel like a loser, a fraud, a dumbass at first. You’re going to be nervous. You’re going to freak out. You may get pissed off at your wife or your friends or your father in the process. These are all side effects of changing your values, of changing the fucks you’re giving. But they are inevitable.It’s simple but really, really hard.”“Growth is an endlessly iterative process. When we learn something new, we don’t go from “wrong” to “right.” Rather, we go from wrong to slightly less wrong. And when we learn something additional, we go from slightly less wrong to slightly less wrong than that, and then to even less wrong than that, and so on. We are always in the process of approaching truth and perfection without actually ever reaching truth or perfection.”He’s changing my world right now.“We all have values for ourselves. We protect these values. We try to live up to them and we justify them and maintain them. Even if we don’t mean to, that’s how our brain is wired. As noted before, we’re unfairly biased toward what we already know, what we believe to be certain. If I believe I’m a nice guy, I’ll avoid situations that could potentially contradict that belief. If I believe I’m an awesome cook, I’ll seek out opportunities to prove that to myself over and over again. The belief always takes precedence. Until we change how we view ourselves, what we believe we are and are not, we cannot overcome our avoidance and anxiety. We cannot change.In this way, “knowing yourself” or “finding yourself” can be dangerous. It can cement you into a strict role and saddle you with unnecessary expectations. It can close you off to inner potential and outer opportunities.I say don’t find yourself. I say never know who you are. Because that’s what keeps you striving and discovering. And it forces you to remain humble in your judgments and accepting of the differences in others.”I didn't even realize I felt this way until I saw it so clearly on paper.“There’s a kind of self-absorption that comes with fear based on an irrational certainty. When you assume that your plane is the one that’s going to crash, or that your project idea is the stupid one everyone is going to laugh at, or that you’re the one everyone is going to choose to mock or ignore, you’re implicitly telling yourself, “I’m the exception; I’m unlike everybody else; I’m different and special.”This is narcissism, pure and simple. You feel as though your problems deserve to be treated differently, that your problems have some unique math to them that doesn’t obey the laws of the physical universe.My recommendation: don’t be special; don’t be unique. Redefine your metrics in mundane and broad ways. Choose to measure yourself not as a rising star or an undiscovered genius. Choose to measure yourself not as some horrible victim or dismal failure. Instead, measure yourself by more mundane identities: a student, a partner, a friend, a creator.”That thing about the plane is 100% me!! So I get it know: if you think you’re special—decide not to be.“The desire to avoid rejection at all costs, to avoid confrontation and conflict, the desire to attempt to accept everything equally and to make everything cohere and harmonize, is a deep and subtle form of entitlement. Entitled people, because they feel as though they deserve to feel great all the time, avoid rejecting anything because doing so might make them or someone else feel bad. And because they refuse to reject anything, they live a valueless, pleasure-driven, and self-absorbed life. All they give a fuck about is sustaining the high a little bit longer, to avoid the inevitable failures of their life, to pretend the suffering away.”“If you make a sacrifice for someone you care about, it needs to be because you want to, not because you feel obligated or because you fear the consequences of not doing so. If your partner is going to make a sacrifice for you, it needs to because he or she genuinely wants to, not because you’ve manipulated the sacrifice through anger or guilt. Acts of love are valid only if they’re performed without conditions or expectations.”

He is probably having a great old laugh at the fact that his mantra `dont try` has resulted in an awful written book, full of cliches, calling reader `dumbass`, referring to us wanting to feel jennifer aniston`s t#ts , and bigging himself up generally.

17,0062457713,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5253785-lyn,3,"A lot of necessary to hear hard truths.There is a distinction between what the title implies and what Manson intends. Manson is essentially inviting us to only care about what’s important and let the rest take care of itself.I’ve been accused of indifference or “living in a bubble” for years because I don’t follow politics and rarely watch the news. My mantra is the serenity prayer:God grant me the serenityto accept the things I cannot change; courage to change the things I can; and wisdom to know the difference.My Muslim friends will sometimes say “Inshallah” which literally translates into “if Allah wills it” or “If God wills it”. When I first heard this, I mistakenly thought it was akin to “screw it” or “I don’t care” but I think this is more similar to the serenity prayer and also what Manson is talking about.I learned years ago that I cannot help or fix everything and to even try is unfair to me, the people I most care about and ultimately the people I am trying to help also. Spread yourself too thin, care too much, give a f*** about stuff that is beyond your reach, and you’re setting yourself up for failure.Manson steers clear of religion for the most part (he does reference Buddhism a few times) and most of his self-help is philosophical in nature. He also provides plenty of illuminating anecdotes to illustrate his perspicacious observations. This also made me consider Aaron James’ 2012 book Assholes: A Theory as Manson spends a fair amount of time describing the actions and motivations of those among us who feel entitled.A fun and insightful book.** 2018 - Great book to think back on and its simple truths. I do give a f***, but I can't fix everything and I accept that. Ultimately its about boundaries and priorities. "

In essence, the question is, should I really give a f*ck?This is sort of an anti-hero self-help book, something you should read (or hear) if you feel the world weighing up a little bit too much. It just unburdens you of some stuff. No real groundbreaking philosophy, just a couple of useful hints and insights on how to take things more lightly, when taking them seriously is hurting you. Chapters 1 and 2 were pure magic. The kind of magic that wouldn't be too bad to hear once or twice a year. If not for the hints, for the laughs. There are also some interesting comments on chapter 8, and some anecdotes here and there. The rest of the book was kind of meh. Funny meh, sure, but typical self-help textbook lines that tires a bit, if not a lot. Couldn't be happier to have chosen audio rather than ebook. Cursing can seem very aggressive when reading it on text, but hearing it through the voice of the narrator it became so much easier, and funnier. Tips: Don't take it too seriously, develop a tolerance to hear the word f*ck once too many often, and just enjoy the ride.Until next time,-----------------------------------------------No es sobre que nada te importe un c*rajo.

Algo que uno debería leer (o escuchar) si empezás a sentír que el mundo te pesa mucho sobre los hombros. Sólo te libera de algunas cosas. No tiene ninguna filosofía innovadora, sólo un par de consejos y observaciones sobre cómo tomar las cosas más ligeramente, cuando tomártelas en serio te hace daño.Los capítulos 1 y 2 fueron pura magia. Ese tipo de magia que no viene mal escucharla una o dos veces al año. Sino por los consejos, por las risas. Tiene también algunos comentarios interesantes en el capítulo 8, y alguna que otra anéctoda aquí y allá. El resto del libro es medio meh, meh gracioso sí, pero típica retórica de autoayuda que cansa un poco, sino mucho.No podría estar más feliz de haberlo escuchado en vez de leerlo. Las puteadas pueden sonar muy agresivas cuando uno las lee en texto, pero escucharlas a través de la voz del narrador hace que sea mucho más ameno, y gracioso.Consejos: No tomarlo muy en serio, desarrollar una tolerancia a escuchar puteadas algo más que seguido, y sólo disfrutar el viaje.Hasta la próxima,"

This book wasn't only about giving no fucks, it was about giving fucks about only the important things. If you're going to read it, I would recommend the audio book. I thought the narration was great and it was highly entertaining and made me laugh out loud more than once!!"
20,0062457713,http://goodreads.com/user/show/175635-trevor,3,"My sister asked me to get her this and I’ve read it as well. It is basically the Buddha and Sartre giving advice by saying fuck every other word. Not a terrible thing, in itself, but a bit like seeing a play where all the actors are naked, the swearing loses its impact after about the third fuck, and then you’re just left with the advice.I don’t normally read self-help books – the problem I have with them is the first word, more than the second. We generally all need some sort of help, but that rarely is helped much by any notion of ‘self’. Ultimately, this guy says much the same thing, which rather surprised me, but shouldn’t have – I’ve already mentioned Buddhism, which has a particularly low opinion of selfhood. But we are so obsessed with being individuals in our society that he probably didn’t feel he could just come out and say from the start – well, get over yourself, fuck face.His advice is basically that you only have so many fucks you can give in life – but life tries to structure itself so that we are in a near perpetual state of outrage. And that way heart attacks lie. His advice isn’t to stop caring, that would be impossible, but to try to decide what you are going to care about and, well, do something about that. In some ways this isn’t too different from something I read by Byung-Chul Han recently – that outrage never changed the world, only rage can. So, pick what you are going to be enraged about and skip the outrage.This isn’t a terrible book, in fact, most of the advice is quite reasonable. All the same, I feel most of the problems we face as humans are to do with the fact we are social animals and our lives are becoming increasingly insular – not least due to various forms of technology – and this is making us feel pretty awful about ourselves. We need to find ways to rebuild communities and meaningful human interactions. And we’ve known this for ages – have a quick read of Durkheim’s Suicide and his explanation of why Catholics and Jews have lower rates of suicide than Protestants. Our obsession with being individuals is literally killing us. The fact this guy bases much of his advice on psychology, to me anyway, is part of the problem – I figure it involves him looking intently down the wrong end of the telescope – but all the same, this is a quick and easy read and parts of it are amusing."

Instagram || Twitter || Facebook || Amazon || PinterestPsychological snake oil for the pseudo intellectual.Man, reading this book was so frustrating, because I'd heard so many good things. Some people told me that this book was life-changing, game-changing, and then one of my co-workers gave it to me and I thought, ""Cool, bring it on. I'm ready to hand out fuck-wafers like it's time for the Sunday Communion of Nobody-Gives-A-Damn."" After reading this book, I've come to the conclusion that the people who like this book haven't taken any psychology classes or read any philosophy books, because this is like the watered-down, urban legend- and common sense-based rehashing of basic tenets you would learn in Phi or Psych 101. Mark Manson seems to me like a dudebro, tossing around the word ""fuck"" like a preteen who's just discovered swearing. But only for the first couple chapters. Then he forgets himself to his navel-gazing, talking about how we should change our values in life and how emotions only affect us insofar as we let them. Which is true, to an extent, but then he brings up how someone who had lost their son prematurely got mad at him on his blog, and Manson gets so upset about it that he feels the need to whine about his experience here, bragging to us about how he decided not to have the last word. But isn't that what you're doing here? You are giving a fuck, and you are immortalizing that fuck you gave in print, while telling us simultaneously that you did not give it. Hmm, sketchy.He also talks about his trip to Russia and praises the Russians for not sugar-coating and telling it like it is, the takeaway being that he admired them for saying ""That's stupid,"" when someone says something stupid. Then he brags about how he likes to tell his wife when she doesn't look good, and how much she appreciates this gaslighting, and how few men would dare to do this amazing thing that he is doing (telling her she looks like shit, according to him). She gets angry, he says, but ultimately she appreciates his honesty. Yeah, I fucking bet. This was straight out of those gross pick-up artist books that teach generations of young males how to neg women to win sex points. #NotAllMenManson had a couple good points, but they were buried in a lot of garbage. For example, in a chapter about relationships, he opens up with the synopsis of Romeo and Juliet as a cautionary example, but then he also tries to namedrop actual science like Philip Zimbardo's Stanford Prison Experiments, and then also namedrops the Buddha when talking about suffering and the inevitability of pain and strife. I am a psychology major who worked in a research laboratory as an undergraduate and I like hard science with data and solid case examples. When I see an article that looks fishy, I look up the facts to determine whether or not it is true. I read scholarly articles. I don't fuck with bullshit. I would rather give a fuck than fuck with bullshit, if you get me. This book did not have facts. It had a lot of opinions masquerading with facts, but honestly, if I want someone to preach dime-store philosophy at me, I'll go to a bar in downtown San Francisco and listen to the vodka fume revelations of CFOs.2 fucks given"

24,0062457713,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2355889-chance-lee,5,"I'm not one for self-help books, but this one spoke to me: ""The desire for more positive experience is itself a negative experience. And, paradoxically, the acceptance of one's negative experience is itself a positive experience."" I don't know how to review this book without typing out the whole book, so I'm going to try something different: to be brief. This book provides support for someone who wants to live in reality, someone who doesn't want to buy into our national capitalist mindset that life is about chasing one high after another. This book encourages you to embrace conflict, to be comfortable feeling uncomfortable, and to be confident in finding out what you truly believe in, then standing up for it. Fuck being likeable. Take responsibility for your own life, stop trying to solve other's problems (a big one for me to work on!), ask questions, and always try to make things better. ""Happiness is a struggle.""My one criticism of this book eventually turned into a positive. Around Chapter Six my interest started to wane because Manson provided me with very little I didn't already know. Plus, he shares his own story about entering his adult life at ""rock bottom."" His life's lowest points: getting caught with marijuana at school, his parents' divorce, not finding a job immediately after college. My initial reaction was, are you fucking kidding me? If that's rock bottom, my life exists in a subterranean cavern. However, Mark Manson's life is not mine. Everyone's experiences are subjective. And, in a way, I admire him even more because of our differences. He led an easy life compared to mine, but he recognized his own privileges and entitlements and worked toward fixing them. Then, he took his own personal realizations about life and shared them in this book, which in turn helps me and others. I rarely read a book that makes me want to thank the author, but -- Thanks for this, Mark. "
25,0062457713,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66224803-jessi-h-vojsk,5,"Oh, wow. I loved this. I really really loved this. I loved that this was so... freely written. Who cares if there are tons of curses in it? Everything he says or teaches us is always followed or introduced with a personal or historical story. There are always examples, stories, explanations that are not overly complicated. The whole book was full of honest, true and really interesting stuff. These were my favorite: - Not giving a fuck does not mean being indifferent, it means being comfortable with being different. - Pain, in all of its forms, is our body’s most effective means of spurring action. - People who become great at something become great because they understand that they’re not already great - they are mediocre, they are average - and that they could be so much better. - Self-awareness is like an onion. There are multiple layers to it, and the more you peel them back, the more likely you’re going to start crying at inappropriate times. - This is because you always get to choose how you see things, how you react to things, how you value things. - Until we change how we view ourselves, what we believe we are and are not, we cannot overcome our avoidance and anxiety. We cannot change. - If you’re stuck on a problem, don’t sit there and think about it, just start working on it. Even if you don’t know what you’re doing, the simple act of working on it will eventually cause the right ideas to show up in your head. - You too are going to die, and that’s because you too were fortunate enough to have lived. All in all I’ll just recommend this to all my non-reader friends and to you, my wonderful Goodreads people, because I loved it and I want you to read this too! Happy reading ♥️"
26,0062457713,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54464244-hamad,3,"This review and other non-spoilery reviews can be found @The Book Prescription  “Life is essentially an endless series of problems. The solution to one problem is merely the creation of another.”🌟 I am not a big fan of Self Help books to be honest. I try to avoid them as much as possible. I just believe that we all have different experiences and we will learn by trying. I also believe that most of what those Self help books are saying is just so obvious and I don’t need to read about it to know it. Despite that, I enjoyed the book and can not say that it won’t affect me one way or another.🌟 The book starts out by cussing, actually a lot! I was not happy by all of that Effing going around but then it became cooler and easier to read. There was a lot of repetition to be honest. Like the idea would be repeated too many times through different chapter in a kind of similar wording.🌟 I enjoyed the real life examples that the book provides and these are always better than the theoretical part. One of the things that I will be applying is to check which metric I am using. A concept that was discussed for the whole part of the book and I think it was the most important one. For example: As book bloggers we have to choose a metric: Is it going to be how much followers I have and having a certain goal in mind or comparing your follower to a large blog. In the first case, a blogger will be happy for example with 100 followers while in the later case, the blogger will keep trying to reach an ever-growing blog and will feel that they are not achieving anything.🌟 Summary: I know this book will not be for everyone and that many will hate it as evidenced by the many 1 stars in the top reviews pages on GR. I believe that you can get something out of this book even if you are not a fan of self-help books as me. I read it because I wanted a less stressful 2019 and I hope it helps me in achieving so. I ended up giving it 3.5 out of 5 stars."

The language isn't really an issue (it just becomes another word that doesn't even seem to have much meaning); it's more that Manson is repetitive and doesn't offer anything original that most people haven't learned for themselves in a few decades of experience. For me, the same ideas are expressed much more elegantly, cogently, and thoroughly in The Antidote: Happiness for People Who Can't Stand Positive Thinking."

The book is a reaction to the self-help industry and what Manson saw as a culture of mindless positivity that isn't practical or helpful for most people. Manson uses many of his own personal experiences to illustrate how life's struggles often give it more meaning, which, he argues, is a better approach than constantly trying to be happy. Manson's approach and writing style have been categorized by some as contrarian to the general self-help industry, using blunt honesty and profanity to illustrate his ideas.The book has 9 chapters with the following titles:1. Don't Try.2. Happiness is a problem.3. You are not special.4. The value of suffering.5. You are always choosing.6. You are wrong about everything (But so am I).7. Failure is the way forward.8.

Instead I got a collection of banal insights, wrapped in supposedly funny dirty-talk. References to philosophy/literature were reminiscent of an author who just skimmed through ""100 ideas in X you need to know"" and didn't bother further. They were forced and off-beat especially considering the overall tone, which itself fluctuated between the earnestness of self-help drivel and the tongue-in-cheek of comedy memoirs. Ironically, this was the only convincing argument made to support the point on making choices to narrow down your options. Looks like the author didn’t even follow his own advice."

I listened to the audiobook and was able to get through it in a few days. Now I know why I don't read self help books. I don't know why but it comes across as so pretentious to me, and hearing Mark Manson ramble on for so long about ""not giving a fuck"" and ""only giving a fuck about the things that matter"" it just felt to me like he was trying too hard. Also, he's a privileged white man and some of this felt very douche-y to me. Like him talking about how he tells his wife when she doesn't look good because honesty is more important... like okay.

Book has no originality and better writers have written more brilliantly about these topics. Entire thing boils down to irritating, naive, amateur psychology from a douchebag in serious ignorance of his douchebaggery. The book suffers from the problem of extremes. In this case, in attempting to correct for admittedly nauseating over positivity bullshit, the author is now guilty of the same crap in the opposite direction - an over glorification of suffering. This is just as much of a crap fest as what he claims to be avoiding. Laughable part is that dude is an entitled little shithead who's got no understanding of suffering. There's even more considerable lack of understanding of medical/scientific research and on some level he seems to believe that people with real psychological issues should just get over themselves cause everyone has problems. When a human being gets to a point where he can equate his self imposed drugged infused decade of ""trauma"" stemming from his parents divorce to the real trauma of a father losing his son, that's serious entitled bullshit! To conclude that someone who has suffered through hellish circumstances can just move on based on cherry picked examples of celebrities making it, is pathetically superficial. This kind of crappy thinking is what results in selfish individuals who can only empathize with others if they have gone through similar experiences themselves. Books like this don't move the dial in improving humanity, they just create/justify narcissistic characters who hide their narcissism behind a wall of false self improvement. This author is no different from the cultish positivity people he scorns. He spews the same sanctimonious, bullshit rhetoric where he pats himself on the back by stating how his values help make the world better! His whole unoriginal theory of put on your big boy panties and get over yourself mentality is just as terrible as the whole disappear into some zen bullshit crapfest. It's this kind of mentality that makes people say if I could make it, I don't get why anyone else can't either. It fails to recognize differences in circumstances. I'm all for suck it up and deal with life but the ability to fail to recognize that maybe the dad with the dead kid has suffered more pain than the asshole with the cheating ex girlfriend is ludicrous! What this guy has done is surround himself with folks so obviously dysfunctional, he ends up looking like the king in a world of spectacular ignorance. The question that should be asked as he gives multiple examples of his idiotic friends being assholes, is how has he managed to collect so many terrible people in his circle? What does this say about his values and judgement? In the end, author is no different from his douchebag ""friend"" he described in the earlier chapters except unlike the friend who limited himself to sponging off of relatives, this dude has expanded his narcissistic reach to a wider audience. Still playing the victim of the trauma of his parents divorce, still standing for nothing except the right to say what he wants, when he wants to whoever he wants. There's a word for people like that - douchebag! "
37,0062457713,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16131467-nate-icart,1,"I absolutely hated this book. Reasons why:-The author's jokes were terrible. His style of humor is just to add a random number to an example (""I felt like I was punched 253 times in the stomach""). -Many (most) of the concepts in this book are ripped from common bodies of knowledge (he explains the basic economic concept of opportunity cost like he was the one who discovered it)-His experiences all feel fake. He talks about how came to deep realizations about his life when we was a fresh college graduate -- not that this is impossible, just very unlikely.-The first few chapters have the word ""Fuck"" in them so much that it just feels like he's making excuses to say it. I like swearing, but every time he talks about sex he calls it ""fucking"". No one talks like that.-It's very hard to take a 32 year old self-help guru seriously when they don't have a real life like the rest of us. He's been a world-traveler and an extremely popular blogger for years. He explained that he only held a ""real"" job for 6 weeks post-graduation. Who can relate to this?-The best part about this book is the cover. Manson is good at marketing, and he's good in short-form (like on his blog), but I will never read another book that he writes."

However, the title of this book piqued my curiosity and it perpetually appears on the main page of Audible as a best seller, thus furthering my interest to pick it up. As an audiobook, I did enjoy this quite a fair bit as the narrator was good and brought life to the narrative. Admittedly, the advice contained herein was not ground-breaking, but delivered in a refreshing and humourous manner. It served as a reminder as to what we probably already know in the deep, dark recesses of our minds, but are too caught up in the hectic modern life and excesses for greater inner reflection. I find a few of the real-life examples quoted to be quite relevant and effective.

Who you are is defined by what you're willing to struggle for.

The title is slightly misleading as the book is not so much as to how not to give a f*ck but to choose what is important enough to give a f*ck about. It is about getting our priorities and values right so that we pick the right battles which truly matter in making our lives count for something. If we start giving a f*ck about every little thing, we will end up spending too much energy on trivial matters and being generally uncontented about life. While it is fine not to feel positive all the time, learning how to channel that in the right direction and taking charge of your life where it is possible to make a difference are the essential messages the book is getting across to the reader. The one theme that was discussed which I feel very strongly about was concerning the 'sense of entitlement' and how this can be destructive in the way one views his or her life. And social media is probably the biggest culprit in propagating this negative view to a whole new level. Being constantly bombarded with reality shows, Instagrams and blogs of beautiful people enjoying a beautiful life, we start to ask ""Why can't I be like so-and-so?"" or ""Why can't I have this or that too?"". As a 14-year old niece of mine rightly pointed out, Instagram represents filtered existence. It seems almost natural now for most to block out the unfavourable or darker segments of life or humanity - such as poverty, hunger, war, violence, human trafficking, prostitution, etc. Instead, we moan and groan about the 'unfortunate circumstances' of not being able to own nice cars and big houses, have great clothes and the requisite body to go with it, go on expensive holidays, or obtain that 'much-deserved' promotion at work - the list goes on and on.Anyway, I'm rambling - this is a topic that I can go on and on about, but that's not the point about this review. If you're curious, this is worth a read as it is quite funny and does not take up much time to finish.

Unfortunately that’s about all that really stands out about Mark Manson’s The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck, which is actually a very ordinary self-help book - and I’ve not even read a lot of self-help books either, that’s how broad, generic and unremarkable a lot of the stuff he talks about here is! Still, its ideas are ultimately positive and worth re-reading and keeping in mind so I can’t say I found the book a total waste of time. The book’s title and main thesis can be summed up as: finding and caring about the shit that matters to you while ignoring the shit that doesn’t - see what I mean when I say it’s unremarkable? But wait, there’s more! Manson has more vapid platitudes like how life’s about the journey, not the destination, how finding meaning in life is better than accumulating material possessions, and that, seeing as we’re all going to die one day, why waste our limited time on shit that doesn’t matter? Not that I disagree with any of that but there’s nothing new or special about that information and you definitely don’t need to read this book to hear that kind of stuff. In fact, you don’t even need to read it anywhere at all as these ideas are so ubiquitous in pop culture as to be cliched! But, like I said, the book also contains useful messages that are worth hearing whether or not you’ve come across them before. Messages like pain and struggle are necessary and unavoidable parts of life. That rising up to challenges and facing hard truths about ourselves help us grow as well as make us stronger at weathering the shit life inevitably throws our way. That failure - so long as we learn from it - eventually leads to success so we shouldn’t be afraid to keep trying even if we’ll probably fail. That dissatisfaction and being uncomfortable are good as they motivate us to change and improve ourselves and our circumstances. I agree that perspective and values are important and that adjusting these can lead to a more satisfying existence. This means accepting that you’ll probably never be rich and famous, that you’re probably not an undiscovered genius or great artist, or that anything you’ll ever do will have any lasting impact on future generations. And that realisation can be freeing to pursue the things that only matter to you.As Manson notes, nothing is certain, which is a profoundly obvious yet difficult lesson I’m slowly learning and re-learning all the time. We also have a tendency to create our own narratives that are confining and are worth exploding as they’re largely bullshit. And I totally agree with and can personally attest that taking more responsibility in your life leads to far greater happiness. Jocko Willink has a similar philosophy: Discipline Equals Freedom. But I don’t buy Manson’s anecdote that when he googled the quote “With great power comes great responsibility” he couldn’t find out who originally said it. As a comics reader, I instantly know it was Spider-Man’s Uncle Ben but I can’t believe a Google search wouldn’t tell him that! He’s right though when he says that excessive freedoms don’t lead to happiness. You only need to look at the toxic Social Justice movement currently poisoning Western politics whose adherents are obsessed with personal freedoms - none of those people are ever happy! His points on the importance of boundaries in relationships and healthy conflict stemming from honesty though were banal and unnecessary. I’m a terrible procrastinator so I really liked the “Do Something” principle where you just do whatever it is you should be doing rather than waiting for the “right moment” or inspiration to strike. The idea is that once you start doing something, especially badly, you’ll eventually start doing it right. Action leads to motivation leads to inspiration leads to success - basically a practical application of not being afraid of failure and one I’ll be trying out myself. I wasn’t that interested in Manson’s autobiographical anecdotes, which were mostly mundane, nor did I find a lot of the examples he chose to illustrate his ideas to be that compelling, though I do like the possibility that Shakespeare wrote Romeo & Juliet as a satire on love especially as so many view it as the ultimate romance story! I also don’t agree that caring less about something means you’ll do better at it or that great people become great because they don’t think they’re great which is why they work harder than most. Both are, like a lot of the statements he makes, an oversimplified generalisation. Maybe he’s right for some but maybe some others already think they’re great and are driven by something else? And, like all self-help books, it needs to be vague enough to be a one-size fits all for the widest possible appeal so I’m not sure how helpful it’s going to be in finding its audience’s meaning in their individual lives - it certainly didn’t mine! But on the whole Manson is a decent writer who’s able to put his ideas across quite clearly in an accessible way. The messaging may be fairly commonplace and underwhelming but I found enough good stuff here to have gotten something out of reading it and if you’ve read no self-help books at all you might find this even more useful! The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck is kinda worth giving a fuck about, just don’t expect much from it. "

Her lip curls at the sight of ""shit"" and her eyebrows furrow at every ""fuck"" thrown by Mark Manson.Condescending Customer: ""Is there a version of this book without cursing? I feel that it is unnecessary...""Jen's jaw drops: That would defeat the purpose of -Awesome colleague grabs an empty journal: Here we go.

41,0062457713,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3643764-esil,4,"3.5 starsI’m not sure what possessed me to listen to this audiobook. I have ZERO interest in self help books. But once I started, I thought it was good enough to keep going.The title is there for shock value, but it’s not a particularly shocking book, unless you’re easily put off by swearing. The author is not really advocating that we all drop everything and run to the beach. He’s arguing for recalibrating what matters to you, and acting on it.The secondary title - “a counterintuitive approach to living a good life” - is deceptive. There’s nothing counterintuitive here. There’s a lot of common sense. But it’s pretty good common sense. And also timely in many ways. So I didn’t have any aha moments, but I nodded my head a fair bit.The question that kept buzzing at the back of my mind is how likely people are to be able to make dramatic changes in their lives by being told to shift the focus on what matters to them. In other words, easier said than done. But still worth thinking about every now and then.I think I’ll stick to my ZERO self help books policy, but this wasn’t a bad foray out of my usual comfort zones."
42,0062457713,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22371819-mariah-roze,4,This was a great book! I've been seeing it everywhere so I wanted to read it. This book was great at reminding you that you shouldn't care what other people think. It is important to do what you want and what your heart wants. It also reminds you that you don't need to be famous or have a spectacular life to have a great life. This is YOUR life. Do what YOU want!
43,0062457713,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45341691-israt-zaman-disha,4,"""The desire for more positive experience is itself a negative experience. And, paradoxically, the acceptance of one’s negative experience is itself a positive experience.""I never thought of reading this book. Saw a hype about it recently in a group on facebook. So I just wanted to know what this book is about. After reading the blurb on goodreads, I thought to give it a go, see what's the hype about. So I started listening to the audiobook. ""Not giving a fuck does not mean being indifferent; it means being comfortable with being different.""First thing I learned from this book is, never judge a book by its cover or title or first chapter. In the first chapter, the author said f*ck like a 100 times. I think there was no need to said that word this many times. I don't have any problem with saying fuck. But when I read/listen to fuck this many times in just one chapter, I cannot help but feel irritated. So yeah, I was irritated but decided to go on. And I am glad of my decision. ""Maturity is what happens when one learns to only give a fuck about what’s truly fuckworthy.""I don't think this book is an inspiring one. The writer didn't want to tell people how to be motivated or how to be a successful person. He simply told how to be happy in life. What is the mantra behind peace and happiness in one's life. And I have to say I totally agree. And that mantra is not giving a fuck. Well, now some may think that not giving a fuck means being indifferent to everything. But that's not true. There's a very thin line between being indifferent and being indifferent to the things that are not important in life. Mark Manson talked about this difference and how we care about everything. In this book, he shared many of his thoughts about happiness, emotion, sufferings, values, responsibilities, rejections, and relations of our life. And I agree with most of the things he said. You can say I am bragging but I found that my thoughts and ideas about life are a lot like Mark Manson. And yes I was lame and pathetic once. But I am growing. I am learning the subtle art of not giving a fuck. ""Being wrong opens us up to the possibility of change. Being wrong brings the opportunity for growth.""One thing I love while reading something is when I find some character I can relate to real life. And this book was full of it. Sometimes I find someone who is exactly like my friend, then someone pretty much like my boss and finally someone a lot like me. It was a major point why I liked this book. ""There is a simple realization from which all personal improvement and growth emerge. This is the realization that we, individually, are responsible for everything in our lives, no matter the external circumstances. We don’t always control what happens to us. But we always control how we interpret what happens to us, as well as how we respond. Whether we consciously recognize it or not, we are always responsible for our experiences.""There's one thing that I didn't understand the last chapter. And I was thinking of giving a star less for it. Then I thought maybe I haven't grown that much yet. So yeah I will reread the last chapter after two or three years and see if it makes any sense. So 5 stars for now... :D ""To be happy we need something to solve. Happiness is, therefore, a form of action..."""
44,0062457713,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38414168-ashish-iyer,2,"It starts off really well but then starts to drag out. The things mentioned in the book are logical and make immense sense, they're also presented with interesting and sometimes personal issues to get the idea. Manson's writing is straight to the point and natural; it flows like a conversation rather than a self-help rant. All this, and I still couldn't find much enthusiasm for the things being said because I find them to be basic things that I've always believed. It did give me a few things to consider and maybe look up, but I don't get why people keep telling me that it's ""life changing."""
45,0062457713,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33447134-book-riot-community,0,"This is a book that every human being should read. It’s less about not giving a fuck and more about what is worth giving a fuck about. And there are things that are worth giving a fuck about! In fact, Manson tells us that having problems is a good thing… only it’s important that we fill our lives mostly with problems that we want to have. Sound confusing? Read the book. He’ll also hit it home that life isn’t fair or easy, and it’s not supposed to be. In fact, if it was you’d be bored to death and would be way less happy than you think you’d be.— Wallace Yovetichfrom The Best Books We Read In January 2017: http://bookriot.com/2017/02/01/riot-r...

I even highlighted tons of favorite quotes from this book, whenever I feel anxious, stressed, or depressed I read those quote and trust me it really ease my mind.“Who you are is defined by what you’re willing to struggle for.” The funny thing is I had no expectation from this book, I just decided to read it because I've seen many people were talking about this book. I am not much into self-help books. When I started to read this book, I knew immediately I would love it. This book doesn't sugarcoat anything. It's blunt, true, and makes you realize not to waste your emotional energy. You should know when and where you should give a fuck and when or where you shouldn't. It will make life a lot different, in a positive way. I would definitely recommend this book."

They're usually written by preachy, entitled people who believe they've ""made it"" telling you what to do and how to think, as if you're a brainless amoeba lapping up their greatness. This book is no different. Filled mainly with questionable anecdotes and retellings of things we already know, I kept on reading for some actual substance. It starts off well enough, but descends into a baseless think piece from the perspective of an entitled white male.

So, lots of advice that most of us probably already know, but will still likely leave you feeling motivated."
49,0062457713,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62428250-karina,4,"First off, I am not much of a self-help reader: not because I think I am perfect and have nothing to learn about myself but because it usually feels like it's a know-it-all slimy salesman telling me what is ""wrong"" with the person I am. BUT Mark Manson had a wonderful approach to his book. He is just a normal person without all that Botox and designer jeans that made his butt look bigger telling me he has many things HE has to work on a daily basis and what he had to overcome to not be a piece of shit psycho. I had to return the book to its rightful owner so I can't pick out my favorite quotes (and I'm not buying it for $30) but this book is very quotable and very raw.I have always known I am a people pleaser and I really hate that trait about me because I put myself in awkward positions and then resent the person I want to help because 1. They weren't grateful enough 2. They will never ever return the favor 3. They turned out to be shitty people. 4. I am just annoyed!So yes, it okay to say NO to people. I don't have to care about every little cause and I should definitely have my priorities straight. Stop being fake and surround yourself with people that are meaningful to you. Just do and see what happens from there. You are not unique and your problems are not unique so once you realize this you can just live your life without that carrot dangling over your sleep. With failure you learn about who you are and can grow as a person. Just because you failed at something doesn't mean you are a failure. Social media life is fake so you are not pathetic for not eating at Spago for lunch or being in the Caribbean this year. Be true to the person you want to be. There was more to it and Manson had some great stories in there. My Negatives- He said ""Fuck"" wwwaaayyy too much. I get it. That's the damn title of the book.Sometimes got repetitive.Overall- recommend."

I wouldn’t normally reach for a self help book, but Mark Moran’s The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck: A Counterintuitive Approach to Living a Good Life, was the pick for our book club this month. It also formed part of challenge read on 'read a self help guide' I have going with a fellow bookworm. I decided to give this book a chance and I went into reading it with an open mind, despite my reservations about the bold title. I surprised myself by enjoying this book. I found it a highly readable, direct, humorous and relatable guide. I wouldn’t say this is a self help book as such, but more a strategy in self evaluation. Many of the ideas and approaches Moran suggests we should take to change our lives are simple to implement and most probably have in the back of our minds – yet Moran suggest what we lack is courage to act on this. What Moran does is put these ideas in spotlight and his book works to give the reader the encouragement needed to put his notions into practice. What I appreciated the most about The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck was insertion of real life stories within this text. Moran linked his approaches to concrete scenarios, which gave his guide much more brevity. From the author Moran’s own back story from hitting rock bottom to becoming a blogger extraordinaire, to celebrity examples such as former Beatles drummer Pete Best and even World War II survivours - the message is clear in all cases. What almost breaks you may in fact make you a stronger, happier and better person. "

I am one of those whom are fed up with all those toxic self-development books. That type of books like: How to achieve greatness, How to win and influence people, how to be rich, etc, etc. This book is completely as it states the ""Counterintuitive approach to Living a Good Life"", the, as I'd love to put it, ""Anti-Self development book of really good life"". So whatever reader are you, this book is for you!""The Subtle Art of Not Giving A F*ck""The moment you read the title you think: ""Really! Could this even be a title?!""A title that will either scare you out to give it a try, or will burn your eagerness to know what it is all about. To be honest, I am freaked out to write a review about this book. I finished the book a day earlier but had no guts to start on writing a review. But as I recently feel obliged to write a review about every single book that I read, thus it seemed inevitable to write it sooner or later. So here we go. Fasten your seat belt!If you have ever heard of Charles Bukowski, Buddha, Hiroo Onoda, Norio Suzuki, Dave Mustaine, Pete Best, William James, Malala Yousafzai, Meredith Maran, Pablo Picasso, Romeo & Juliet, Ernest Becker, then trust me, you will learn their stories again in a very different way that will seize your mind and leave you completely astonished.This book will help you know why all the other self-development books didn't help you or anyone else through the principle of the Feedback Loop from Hell.It will tell you why we are always searching for the happiness and what should the true happiness be from everyone's own perspective.Moreover it will accuse you, and me, of overrating certain life aspects. You will also get to meet the Disappointment Panda and figure out how would you deal with him.You will learn by yourself how everyone is given to choose their own struggles.You will know that it is not a must to me the superhero and the very special person in that exaggerating behavior, in a matter of fact, thus everyone should be one! Nevertheless not lowering or diminishing the value of being one!It will tear you apart while knowing the value of suffering, the shitty values and great values through The Self-Awarness Onion.Furthermore, it will condemn you of your responsibilities and all the freedom of choice you have. It will hit you on the head by letting you ask yourself: ""What if I am wrong about everything?"" Last but not least, It will grab you by the arm to know that failure, pain and rejection are part of the process by getting to know the Do Something principle.
This book is about everything in your life. It isn't limited to career topics or relationship styling. But rather to a higher and more intellectual state of mind and reason. This book is for you!This book is not rocket science, it doesn't inform us of new matters that were unknown to us. Rather it tells you exactly what you already know, what is standing right in front of your nose, down in simple, friendly, invasive words that will leave you seeing things much more different than before.I have made it across a lot of various books, but this book is surely different. I believe this book was the hit on the head that I urgely needed to wake up and sort things out differently and to view all my priorities and values with an entirely conscious mind. And to put all my life, past and future, into question!This book will drive you to get hurt facing the inevitable truth, will make you show up your deepest wounds, will leave you in anger, rage and tears depending on what you have encountered in life and the VALUES you are living by.P.S.

I think it's an attempt to piggyback on the success of Marie Kondo's book by being ""inspired"" by the title and hoping people will pay money without looking too hard at the contents of the book."

In Manson's witty words, managing the amount of fucks you give. Minimizing the scope of your interests really—to the essentials. Putting all of your eggs in that one basket. Figuring out what that basket is in the first place. Does that make sense?I enjoyed a couple of ideas. One of them is on the importance of cultivating doubt. Manson claims that uncertainty is the way forward and that the key to personal growth lies in being comfortable with it. The comfort breeds an openness that obliterates sticking to rigid values and motivates us towards positive change. Uncertainty breaks the entitlement chain, the belief that you're a special snowflake who deserves special treatment from the world—the naivety of expecting something for nothing, to be loved for doing nothing, to be appreciated for doing nothing, and so on. To break the hold of the spell of certainty and entitlement, Mr. Manson proposes asking yourself three golden questions:1- What if I'm wrong? 2- What would it mean if I'm wrong? 3- Would me being wrong create better problems? I tried them for size and trust me, the sheer entertaining of the possibility of being wrong is refreshing. Also wonderful in cultivating compassion, humility, and acceptance of oneself and others. The success formula Manson proposes goes something like this:Happiness comes from solving problems, and the quality of your problems is determined by the quality of your values and metrics, the standards by which you measure your success. Naturally, the better the problems, the more successful you are. Good problems come from having good values and metrics. And so Manson dedicates more than half of his book to what he sees as the five most important values, and he summarizes them on page 89 in one paragraph:""The first ... is a radical form of responsibility: taking responsibility for everything that occurs in your life, regardless of who's at fault. The second is uncertainty: the acknowledgment of your own ignorance and the cultivation of constant doubt in your own beliefs. The next is failure ... The fourth is rejection: the ability to both say and hear no ... The final value is the contemplation of one's own mortality.""Another idea that stuck is the Do Something Principle, the idea that action can and sometimes should precede motivation. This reminded me of Ralph Waldo Emerson's famous quote: ""Do the thing and you shall have the power."" Most of us, unfortunately, spend our entire lives waiting for that power to come down, waiting for the muse instead of moving in the direction of our dreams. Action > Inspiration > Motivation > Action... (Loop) In the end, The Subtle Art is a sobering unconventional take on self-help, and I recommend it for people looking for just that. Three stars and a half, with a grain of salt. My rating came down from four and a half thanks to me cultivating doubt about this book. So here goes that Mr. Manson."

""Everything worthwhile in life is won through surmounting the associated negative experience. Any attempt to escape the negative, to avoid it or quash it or silence it, only backfires. The avoidance of suffering is a form of suffering. The avoidance of struggle is a struggle. The denial of failure is a failure. Hiding what is shameful is itself a form of shame.Pain is an inextricable thread in the fabric of life, and to tear it out is not only impossible, but destructive: attempting to tear it out unravels everything else with it. To try to avoid pain is to give too many fucks about pain. In contrast, if you’re able to not give a fuck about the pain, you become unstoppable.""
I can't explain how much i love this book. It was even more fun listening to it than reading it. Plus, it's a very short listen; about 6 hours if I remember correctly. It starts off pretty light-hearted and funny with some good points. Then it gets pretty heavy by the end. The last 2 chapter were probably my favorite. It's not a book about giving no fucks at all, only psychopaths and liars don't care about anything, but more so about figuring out what is worthy of the fucks you'll give. Whether you think you give too many fucks or aren't sure what to give a fuck about, read this book. At the very least it's worth using one of your audible credits on. "
57,0062457713,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6168938-zoe,3,Nothing illuminating in this book but it is VERY funny. What the writer wrote about is something we know but often forget. So it was a good reminder for us to focus on the important things. 
58,0062457713,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18989854-krystal,4,"First up, the title is clearly more for shock factor than an accurate title for this book since f*cks are still given, albeit selectively.Second, if bad language, crass stories and vulgar honesty offend you, this may not be an appropriate choice of reading material.Thirdly, these are not particularly new concepts. For alternative reads without the swearing and vulgarity, I'd recommend Daring Greatly: How the Courage to Be Vulnerable Transforms the Way We Live, Love, Parent, and Lead (my 5 star review here) and/or The Courage to be Disliked (my 4 star review here) I'm not a huge fan of swearing etc. myself but this was more about bluntness and simplicity rather than swearing for the sake of it so I didn't mind it quite so much. It's just honest and raw and is quite serious about making its point that no one and nothing is perfect.The point of this book is not to stop 'giving a f*ck', but to choose wisely the things you decide to care about. It raises the fairly common notion that true happiness is beyond the material, and caring about things you can't change (such as others' feelings) will do more harm than good. These ideas are something I definitely connect with, and I do think it's important to take responsibility for your own happiness. Yes, sometimes sh*tty things happen, but you have to find a way through the sh*t to ultimately become stronger, otherwise you're giving up happiness in favour of being a victim.The delivery is certainly not for everyone as there's no sympathy here, and the apathetic will be disappointed because instead of finding a common ideal this book hits with some hard truths. People who are offended easily will find plenty to be offended about, and it's easy to criticise the author for his sexist examples and analogies and the despicable behaviour of his past (which we only know because he has chosen to share). It starts with the message, 'don't try' and concludes with '...and then you die' and in between is a whole lot of 'you are not special', which honestly all sounds quite depressing but it really does make a lot of sense. It tells us we are not special, but then goes on to suggest why that might be so painful to hear. If you are open-minded, you'll understand and perhaps appreciate the wisdom in it; if you're more stubborn you'll close your eyes, cover your ears and repeat to yourself that you are special, no matter what this crappy little book says (thus increasing the pressure on yourself to be special). All in all, the book makes a lot of sense, but you have to be open and accepting enough to appreciate it.Side note: I was really surprised there were no references listed, considering how many names were dropped and psychology experiments referenced etc. Curious.If this rubbed you up the wrong way I'd definitely suggest giving Daring Greatly a chance, as it's a much more comprehensive (and kind) exploration of the same themes.This was book 24 in my #Dymocks52challenge refined.

The book is a reaction to the self-help industry and what Manson saw as a culture of mindless positivity that isn't practical or helpful for most people. Manson uses many of his own personal experiences to illustrate how life's struggles often give it more meaning, which, he argues, is a better approach than constantly trying to be happy. Manson's approach and writing style have been categorized by some as contrarian to the general self-help industry, using blunt honesty and profanity to illustrate his ideas.The book has 9 chapters with the following titles:1. Don't Try.2. Happiness is a problem.3. You are not special.4. The value of suffering.5. You are always choosing.6. You are wrong about everything (But so am I).7. Failure is the way forward.8. The importance of saying no.9.

Surprisingly, oftentimes, I ended up getting ''into'' whatever action I was performing that I initially wanted to avoid. So I agree that action can bring about inspiration which can lead to motivation. "

I like to browse this list because it shows you what people are actually reading instead of just what people are buying.I find the list more useful than other bestsellers’ list because it tells me which books are engaging people, after all, we’ve all picked up a title and abandoned it after a few pages because it wasn’t interesting or compelling.So, I went ahead and borrowed it from the library. This book offers a is a zero-nonsense approach to self-help concepts. I’ve heard most of it before but the author delivers the message in a concise, sorry-if-it-hurts, straight-forward way.I found some of the advice helpful and I’m glad I read it. I understand now why it might resonate with many people and recommend it to those always seeking to improve themselves."
64,0062457713,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20214132-crankmuffin,2,"I was expecting an enjoyable read on not taking things too seriously. Instead I got a collection of banal insights, wrapped in supposedly funny dirty-talk. References to philosophy/literature were reminiscent of an author who just skimmed through ""100 ideas in X you need to know"" and didn't bother further. They were forced and off-beat especially considering the overall tone, which itself fluctuated between the earnestness of self-help drivel and the tongue-in-cheek of comedy memoirs. Ironically, this was the only convincing argument made to support the point on making choices to narrow down your options. Looks like the author didn’t even follow his own advice."
65,0062457713,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26560207-gabby,2,"I don't read a lot of self help books. In fact, I don't think I've ever read one before this. But I've seen this one floating around and it's been getting some great reviews so I got curious and decided to check this one out. I listened to the audiobook and was able to get through it in a few days. Now I know why I don't read self help books. I don't know why but it comes across as so pretentious to me, and hearing Mark Manson ramble on for so long about ""not giving a fuck"" and ""only giving a fuck about the things that matter"" it just felt to me like he was trying too hard. Also, he's a privileged white man and some of this felt very douche-y to me. Like him talking about how he tells his wife when she doesn't look good because honesty is more important... like okay. I just didn't enjoy this the way I thought I might. I don't think self help books are for me. "
66,0062457713,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5632120-zaphoddent,1,"Catchy title but fails to deliver on anything concrete. Book has no originality and better writers have written more brilliantly about these topics. Entire thing boils down to irritating, naive, amateur psychology from a douchebag in serious ignorance of his douchebaggery. The book suffers from the problem of extremes. In this case, in attempting to correct for admittedly nauseating over positivity bullshit, the author is now guilty of the same crap in the opposite direction - an over glorification of suffering. This is just as much of a crap fest as what he claims to be avoiding. Laughable part is that dude is an entitled little shithead who's got no understanding of suffering. There's even more considerable lack of understanding of medical/scientific research and on some level he seems to believe that people with real psychological issues should just get over themselves cause everyone has problems. When a human being gets to a point where he can equate his self imposed drugged infused decade of ""trauma"" stemming from his parents divorce to the real trauma of a father losing his son, that's serious entitled bullshit! To conclude that someone who has suffered through hellish circumstances can just move on based on cherry picked examples of celebrities making it, is pathetically superficial. This kind of crappy thinking is what results in selfish individuals who can only empathize with others if they have gone through similar experiences themselves. Books like this don't move the dial in improving humanity, they just create/justify narcissistic characters who hide their narcissism behind a wall of false self improvement. This author is no different from the cultish positivity people he scorns. He spews the same sanctimonious, bullshit rhetoric where he pats himself on the back by stating how his values help make the world better! His whole unoriginal theory of put on your big boy panties and get over yourself mentality is just as terrible as the whole disappear into some zen bullshit crapfest. It's this kind of mentality that makes people say if I could make it, I don't get why anyone else can't either. It fails to recognize differences in circumstances. I'm all for suck it up and deal with life but the ability to fail to recognize that maybe the dad with the dead kid has suffered more pain than the asshole with the cheating ex girlfriend is ludicrous! What this guy has done is surround himself with folks so obviously dysfunctional, he ends up looking like the king in a world of spectacular ignorance. The question that should be asked as he gives multiple examples of his idiotic friends being assholes, is how has he managed to collect so many terrible people in his circle? What does this say about his values and judgement? In the end, author is no different from his douchebag ""friend"" he described in the earlier chapters except unlike the friend who limited himself to sponging off of relatives, this dude has expanded his narcissistic reach to a wider audience. Still playing the victim of the trauma of his parents divorce, still standing for nothing except the right to say what he wants, when he wants to whoever he wants. There's a word for people like that - douchebag! "
67,0062457713,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16131467-nate-icart,1,"I absolutely hated this book. Reasons why:-The author's jokes were terrible. His style of humor is just to add a random number to an example (""I felt like I was punched 253 times in the stomach""). -Many (most) of the concepts in this book are ripped from common bodies of knowledge (he explains the basic economic concept of opportunity cost like he was the one who discovered it)-His experiences all feel fake. He talks about how came to deep realizations about his life when we was a fresh college graduate -- not that this is impossible, just very unlikely.-The first few chapters have the word ""Fuck"" in them so much that it just feels like he's making excuses to say it. I like swearing, but every time he talks about sex he calls it ""fucking"". No one talks like that.-It's very hard to take a 32 year old self-help guru seriously when they don't have a real life like the rest of us. He's been a world-traveler and an extremely popular blogger for years. He explained that he only held a ""real"" job for 6 weeks post-graduation. Who can relate to this?-The best part about this book is the cover. Manson is good at marketing, and he's good in short-form (like on his blog), but I will never read another book that he writes."
68,0062457713,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30279227-ts-chan,3,"3.5 stars.I don't usually reach for self-help books. However, the title of this book piqued my curiosity and it perpetually appears on the main page of Audible as a best seller, thus furthering my interest to pick it up. As an audiobook, I did enjoy this quite a fair bit as the narrator was good and brought life to the narrative. Admittedly, the advice contained herein was not ground-breaking, but delivered in a refreshing and humourous manner. It served as a reminder as to what we probably already know in the deep, dark recesses of our minds, but are too caught up in the hectic modern life and excesses for greater inner reflection. I find a few of the real-life examples quoted to be quite relevant and effective.

Who you are is defined by what you're willing to struggle for.

The title is slightly misleading as the book is not so much as to how not to give a f*ck but to choose what is important enough to give a f*ck about. It is about getting our priorities and values right so that we pick the right battles which truly matter in making our lives count for something. If we start giving a f*ck about every little thing, we will end up spending too much energy on trivial matters and being generally uncontented about life. While it is fine not to feel positive all the time, learning how to channel that in the right direction and taking charge of your life where it is possible to make a difference are the essential messages the book is getting across to the reader. The one theme that was discussed which I feel very strongly about was concerning the 'sense of entitlement' and how this can be destructive in the way one views his or her life. And social media is probably the biggest culprit in propagating this negative view to a whole new level. Being constantly bombarded with reality shows, Instagrams and blogs of beautiful people enjoying a beautiful life, we start to ask ""Why can't I be like so-and-so?"" or ""Why can't I have this or that too?"". As a 14-year old niece of mine rightly pointed out, Instagram represents filtered existence. It seems almost natural now for most to block out the unfavourable or darker segments of life or humanity - such as poverty, hunger, war, violence, human trafficking, prostitution, etc. Instead, we moan and groan about the 'unfortunate circumstances' of not being able to own nice cars and big houses, have great clothes and the requisite body to go with it, go on expensive holidays, or obtain that 'much-deserved' promotion at work - the list goes on and on.Anyway, I'm rambling - this is a topic that I can go on and on about, but that's not the point about this review. If you're curious, this is worth a read as it is quite funny and does not take up much time to finish. Even though much of what is said was nothing new, sometimes we just need that extra nudge.This review can also be found at Booknest"
69,0062457713,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5759543-sam-quixote,3,"Eye-catching title, eh? Unfortunately that’s about all that really stands out about Mark Manson’s The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck, which is actually a very ordinary self-help book - and I’ve not even read a lot of self-help books either, that’s how broad, generic and unremarkable a lot of the stuff he talks about here is! Still, its ideas are ultimately positive and worth re-reading and keeping in mind so I can’t say I found the book a total waste of time. The book’s title and main thesis can be summed up as: finding and caring about the shit that matters to you while ignoring the shit that doesn’t - see what I mean when I say it’s unremarkable? But wait, there’s more! Manson has more vapid platitudes like how life’s about the journey, not the destination, how finding meaning in life is better than accumulating material possessions, and that, seeing as we’re all going to die one day, why waste our limited time on shit that doesn’t matter? Not that I disagree with any of that but there’s nothing new or special about that information and you definitely don’t need to read this book to hear that kind of stuff. In fact, you don’t even need to read it anywhere at all as these ideas are so ubiquitous in pop culture as to be cliched! But, like I said, the book also contains useful messages that are worth hearing whether or not you’ve come across them before. Messages like pain and struggle are necessary and unavoidable parts of life. That rising up to challenges and facing hard truths about ourselves help us grow as well as make us stronger at weathering the shit life inevitably throws our way. That failure - so long as we learn from it - eventually leads to success so we shouldn’t be afraid to keep trying even if we’ll probably fail. That dissatisfaction and being uncomfortable are good as they motivate us to change and improve ourselves and our circumstances. I agree that perspective and values are important and that adjusting these can lead to a more satisfying existence. This means accepting that you’ll probably never be rich and famous, that you’re probably not an undiscovered genius or great artist, or that anything you’ll ever do will have any lasting impact on future generations. And that realisation can be freeing to pursue the things that only matter to you.As Manson notes, nothing is certain, which is a profoundly obvious yet difficult lesson I’m slowly learning and re-learning all the time. We also have a tendency to create our own narratives that are confining and are worth exploding as they’re largely bullshit. And I totally agree with and can personally attest that taking more responsibility in your life leads to far greater happiness. Jocko Willink has a similar philosophy: Discipline Equals Freedom. But I don’t buy Manson’s anecdote that when he googled the quote “With great power comes great responsibility” he couldn’t find out who originally said it. As a comics reader, I instantly know it was Spider-Man’s Uncle Ben but I can’t believe a Google search wouldn’t tell him that! He’s right though when he says that excessive freedoms don’t lead to happiness. You only need to look at the toxic Social Justice movement currently poisoning Western politics whose adherents are obsessed with personal freedoms - none of those people are ever happy! His points on the importance of boundaries in relationships and healthy conflict stemming from honesty though were banal and unnecessary. I’m a terrible procrastinator so I really liked the “Do Something” principle where you just do whatever it is you should be doing rather than waiting for the “right moment” or inspiration to strike. The idea is that once you start doing something, especially badly, you’ll eventually start doing it right. Action leads to motivation leads to inspiration leads to success - basically a practical application of not being afraid of failure and one I’ll be trying out myself. I wasn’t that interested in Manson’s autobiographical anecdotes, which were mostly mundane, nor did I find a lot of the examples he chose to illustrate his ideas to be that compelling, though I do like the possibility that Shakespeare wrote Romeo & Juliet as a satire on love especially as so many view it as the ultimate romance story! I also don’t agree that caring less about something means you’ll do better at it or that great people become great because they don’t think they’re great which is why they work harder than most. Both are, like a lot of the statements he makes, an oversimplified generalisation. Maybe he’s right for some but maybe some others already think they’re great and are driven by something else? And, like all self-help books, it needs to be vague enough to be a one-size fits all for the widest possible appeal so I’m not sure how helpful it’s going to be in finding its audience’s meaning in their individual lives - it certainly didn’t mine! But on the whole Manson is a decent writer who’s able to put his ideas across quite clearly in an accessible way. The messaging may be fairly commonplace and underwhelming but I found enough good stuff here to have gotten something out of reading it and if you’ve read no self-help books at all you might find this even more useful! The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck is kinda worth giving a fuck about, just don’t expect much from it. "

So I haven't read this book yet, but here's a short play about one of the most ridiculous encounters regarding this book.Hesitant Customer (without children - this is important): ""Could I please see the Subtle Art of not Giving a....""Jen: ""Fuck?""Indignant Customer: ""Yes.""The customer flips through the book. Her lip curls at the sight of ""shit"" and her eyebrows furrow at every ""fuck"" thrown by Mark Manson.Condescending Customer: ""Is there a version of this book without cursing?

The purpose of the book is to stop worrying about bullshit and fuckery that you worry about in life. If you're worried about the word ""fuck"", you need this book more than anyone else.

71,0062457713,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3643764-esil,4,"3.5 starsI’m not sure what possessed me to listen to this audiobook. I have ZERO interest in self help books. But once I started, I thought it was good enough to keep going.The title is there for shock value, but it’s not a particularly shocking book, unless you’re easily put off by swearing. The author is not really advocating that we all drop everything and run to the beach. He’s arguing for recalibrating what matters to you, and acting on it.The secondary title - “a counterintuitive approach to living a good life” - is deceptive. There’s nothing counterintuitive here. There’s a lot of common sense. But it’s pretty good common sense. And also timely in many ways. So I didn’t have any aha moments, but I nodded my head a fair bit.The question that kept buzzing at the back of my mind is how likely people are to be able to make dramatic changes in their lives by being told to shift the focus on what matters to them. In other words, easier said than done. But still worth thinking about every now and then.I think I’ll stick to my ZERO self help books policy, but this wasn’t a bad foray out of my usual comfort zones."
72,0062457713,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22371819-mariah-roze,4,This was a great book! I've been seeing it everywhere so I wanted to read it. This book was great at reminding you that you shouldn't care what other people think. It is important to do what you want and what your heart wants. It also reminds you that you don't need to be famous or have a spectacular life to have a great life. This is YOUR life. Do what YOU want!
73,0062457713,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45341691-israt-zaman-disha,4,"""The desire for more positive experience is itself a negative experience. And, paradoxically, the acceptance of one’s negative experience is itself a positive experience.""I never thought of reading this book. Saw a hype about it recently in a group on facebook. So I just wanted to know what this book is about. After reading the blurb on goodreads, I thought to give it a go, see what's the hype about. So I started listening to the audiobook. ""Not giving a fuck does not mean being indifferent; it means being comfortable with being different.""First thing I learned from this book is, never judge a book by its cover or title or first chapter. In the first chapter, the author said f*ck like a 100 times. I think there was no need to said that word this many times. I don't have any problem with saying fuck. But when I read/listen to fuck this many times in just one chapter, I cannot help but feel irritated. So yeah, I was irritated but decided to go on. And I am glad of my decision. ""Maturity is what happens when one learns to only give a fuck about what’s truly fuckworthy.""I don't think this book is an inspiring one. The writer didn't want to tell people how to be motivated or how to be a successful person. He simply told how to be happy in life. What is the mantra behind peace and happiness in one's life. And I have to say I totally agree. And that mantra is not giving a fuck. Well, now some may think that not giving a fuck means being indifferent to everything. But that's not true. There's a very thin line between being indifferent and being indifferent to the things that are not important in life. Mark Manson talked about this difference and how we care about everything. In this book, he shared many of his thoughts about happiness, emotion, sufferings, values, responsibilities, rejections, and relations of our life. And I agree with most of the things he said. You can say I am bragging but I found that my thoughts and ideas about life are a lot like Mark Manson. And yes I was lame and pathetic once. But I am growing. I am learning the subtle art of not giving a fuck. ""Being wrong opens us up to the possibility of change. Being wrong brings the opportunity for growth.""One thing I love while reading something is when I find some character I can relate to real life. And this book was full of it. Sometimes I find someone who is exactly like my friend, then someone pretty much like my boss and finally someone a lot like me. It was a major point why I liked this book. ""There is a simple realization from which all personal improvement and growth emerge. This is the realization that we, individually, are responsible for everything in our lives, no matter the external circumstances. We don’t always control what happens to us. But we always control how we interpret what happens to us, as well as how we respond. Whether we consciously recognize it or not, we are always responsible for our experiences.""There's one thing that I didn't understand the last chapter. And I was thinking of giving a star less for it. Then I thought maybe I haven't grown that much yet. So yeah I will reread the last chapter after two or three years and see if it makes any sense. So 5 stars for now... :D ""To be happy we need something to solve. Happiness is, therefore, a form of action..."""
74,0062457713,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38414168-ashish-iyer,2,"It starts off really well but then starts to drag out. The things mentioned in the book are logical and make immense sense, they're also presented with interesting and sometimes personal issues to get the idea. Manson's writing is straight to the point and natural; it flows like a conversation rather than a self-help rant. All this, and I still couldn't find much enthusiasm for the things being said because I find them to be basic things that I've always believed. It did give me a few things to consider and maybe look up, but I don't get why people keep telling me that it's ""life changing."""

It’s less about not giving a fuck and more about what is worth giving a fuck about. And there are things that are worth giving a fuck about! In fact, Manson tells us that having problems is a good thing… only it’s important that we fill our lives mostly with problems that we want to have. Sound confusing? Read the book. He’ll also hit it home that life isn’t fair or easy, and it’s not supposed to be. In fact, if it was you’d be bored to death and would be way less happy than you think you’d be.— Wallace Yovetichfrom The Best Books We Read In January 2017: http://bookriot.com/2017/02/01/riot-r...

I am not much into self-help books. When I started to read this book, I knew immediately I would love it. This book doesn't sugarcoat anything.

They're usually written by preachy, entitled people who believe they've ""made it"" telling you what to do and how to think, as if you're a brainless amoeba lapping up their greatness. This book is no different. Filled mainly with questionable anecdotes and retellings of things we already know, I kept on reading for some actual substance.

So, lots of advice that most of us probably already know, but will still likely leave you feeling motivated."
79,0062457713,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62428250-karina,4,"First off, I am not much of a self-help reader: not because I think I am perfect and have nothing to learn about myself but because it usually feels like it's a know-it-all slimy salesman telling me what is ""wrong"" with the person I am. BUT Mark Manson had a wonderful approach to his book. He is just a normal person without all that Botox and designer jeans that made his butt look bigger telling me he has many things HE has to work on a daily basis and what he had to overcome to not be a piece of shit psycho. I had to return the book to its rightful owner so I can't pick out my favorite quotes (and I'm not buying it for $30) but this book is very quotable and very raw.I have always known I am a people pleaser and I really hate that trait about me because I put myself in awkward positions and then resent the person I want to help because 1. They weren't grateful enough 2. They will never ever return the favor 3. They turned out to be shitty people. 4. I am just annoyed!So yes, it okay to say NO to people. I don't have to care about every little cause and I should definitely have my priorities straight. Stop being fake and surround yourself with people that are meaningful to you. Just do and see what happens from there. You are not unique and your problems are not unique so once you realize this you can just live your life without that carrot dangling over your sleep. With failure you learn about who you are and can grow as a person. Just because you failed at something doesn't mean you are a failure. Social media life is fake so you are not pathetic for not eating at Spago for lunch or being in the Caribbean this year. Be true to the person you want to be. There was more to it and Manson had some great stories in there. My Negatives- He said ""Fuck"" wwwaaayyy too much. I get it. That's the damn title of the book.Sometimes got repetitive.Overall- recommend."

I found it a highly readable, direct, humorous and relatable guide. I wouldn’t say this is a self help book as such, but more a strategy in self evaluation. Many of the ideas and approaches Moran suggests we should take to change our lives are simple to implement and most probably have in the back of our minds – yet Moran suggest what we lack is courage to act on this. What Moran does is put these ideas in spotlight and his book works to give the reader the encouragement needed to put his notions into practice. What I appreciated the most about The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck was insertion of real life stories within this text. Moran linked his approaches to concrete scenarios, which gave his guide much more brevity. From the author Moran’s own back story from hitting rock bottom to becoming a blogger extraordinaire, to celebrity examples such as former Beatles drummer Pete Best and even World War II survivours - the message is clear in all cases. What almost breaks you may in fact make you a stronger, happier and better person. "

For me, I am the Anti-Self-Development type, however, sometimes I give a book or two a chance to make a difference and change my mind. And that truly rarely or never happens. I am one of those whom are fed up with all those toxic self-development books. That type of books like: How to achieve greatness, How to win and influence people, how to be rich, etc, etc. This book is completely as it states the ""Counterintuitive approach to Living a Good Life"", the, as I'd love to put it, ""Anti-Self development book of really good life"". So whatever reader are you, this book is for you!""The Subtle Art of Not Giving A F*ck""The moment you read the title you think: ""Really! Could this even be a title?!""A title that will either scare you out to give it a try, or will burn your eagerness to know what it is all about. To be honest, I am freaked out to write a review about this book. I finished the book a day earlier but had no guts to start on writing a review. But as I recently feel obliged to write a review about every single book that I read, thus it seemed inevitable to write it sooner or later. So here we go. Fasten your seat belt!If you have ever heard of Charles Bukowski, Buddha, Hiroo Onoda, Norio Suzuki, Dave Mustaine, Pete Best, William James, Malala Yousafzai, Meredith Maran, Pablo Picasso, Romeo & Juliet, Ernest Becker, then trust me, you will learn their stories again in a very different way that will seize your mind and leave you completely astonished.This book will help you know why all the other self-development books didn't help you or anyone else through the principle of the Feedback Loop from Hell.It will tell you why we are always searching for the happiness and what should the true happiness be from everyone's own perspective.Moreover it will accuse you, and me, of overrating certain life aspects. You will also get to meet the Disappointment Panda and figure out how would you deal with him.You will learn by yourself how everyone is given to choose their own struggles.You will know that it is not a must to me the superhero and the very special person in that exaggerating behavior, in a matter of fact, thus everyone should be one! Nevertheless not lowering or diminishing the value of being one!It will tear you apart while knowing the value of suffering, the shitty values and great values through The Self-Awarness Onion.Furthermore, it will condemn you of your responsibilities and all the freedom of choice you have. It will hit you on the head by letting you ask yourself: ""What if I am wrong about everything?"" Last but not least, It will grab you by the arm to know that failure, pain and rejection are part of the process by getting to know the Do Something principle.
This book is about everything in your life. It isn't limited to career topics or relationship styling. But rather to a higher and more intellectual state of mind and reason. This book is for you!This book is not rocket science, it doesn't inform us of new matters that were unknown to us. Rather it tells you exactly what you already know, what is standing right in front of your nose, down in simple, friendly, invasive words that will leave you seeing things much more different than before.I have made it across a lot of various books, but this book is surely different. I believe this book was the hit on the head that I urgely needed to wake up and sort things out differently and to view all my priorities and values with an entirely conscious mind. And to put all my life, past and future, into question!This book will drive you to get hurt facing the inevitable truth, will make you show up your deepest wounds, will leave you in anger, rage and tears depending on what you have encountered in life and the VALUES you are living by.P.S. If you are rigid follower of my reviews you will understand why I underlined the word VALUES and why this book is a so life changing experience to me. As I hope it would be to you too."

I think it's an attempt to piggyback on the success of Marie Kondo's book by being ""inspired"" by the title and hoping people will pay money without looking too hard at the contents of the book."

Mark Manson really speaks the truth and talks about important issues that are part of our lives. But it takes time, effort and great amount of work on yourself to get to that state of mind he's talking about. We easily fall into routine and complain about it, but not everyone is willing to break the cycle. I think I need to read this book every year.„Don’t just sit there. Do something.

Everyone in this room is now dumber for having listened to it. I award you no points Mr Manson, and may God have mercy on your soul."
85,0062457713,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31777090-sohaib,4,"This book is about setting and honing personal values. It's about determining what to give a fuck about in your life. In Manson's witty words, managing the amount of fucks you give. Minimizing the scope of your interests really—to the essentials. Putting all of your eggs in that one basket. Figuring out what that basket is in the first place. Does that make sense?I enjoyed a couple of ideas. One of them is on the importance of cultivating doubt. Manson claims that uncertainty is the way forward and that the key to personal growth lies in being comfortable with it. The comfort breeds an openness that obliterates sticking to rigid values and motivates us towards positive change. Uncertainty breaks the entitlement chain, the belief that you're a special snowflake who deserves special treatment from the world—the naivety of expecting something for nothing, to be loved for doing nothing, to be appreciated for doing nothing, and so on. To break the hold of the spell of certainty and entitlement, Mr. Manson proposes asking yourself three golden questions:1- What if I'm wrong? 2- What would it mean if I'm wrong? 3- Would me being wrong create better problems? I tried them for size and trust me, the sheer entertaining of the possibility of being wrong is refreshing. Also wonderful in cultivating compassion, humility, and acceptance of oneself and others. The success formula Manson proposes goes something like this:Happiness comes from solving problems, and the quality of your problems is determined by the quality of your values and metrics, the standards by which you measure your success. Naturally, the better the problems, the more successful you are. Good problems come from having good values and metrics. And so Manson dedicates more than half of his book to what he sees as the five most important values, and he summarizes them on page 89 in one paragraph:""The first ... is a radical form of responsibility: taking responsibility for everything that occurs in your life, regardless of who's at fault. The second is uncertainty: the acknowledgment of your own ignorance and the cultivation of constant doubt in your own beliefs. The next is failure ... The fourth is rejection: the ability to both say and hear no ... The final value is the contemplation of one's own mortality.""Another idea that stuck is the Do Something Principle, the idea that action can and sometimes should precede motivation. This reminded me of Ralph Waldo Emerson's famous quote: ""Do the thing and you shall have the power."" Most of us, unfortunately, spend our entire lives waiting for that power to come down, waiting for the muse instead of moving in the direction of our dreams. Action > Inspiration > Motivation > Action... (Loop) In the end, The Subtle Art is a sobering unconventional take on self-help, and I recommend it for people looking for just that. Three stars and a half, with a grain of salt. My rating came down from four and a half thanks to me cultivating doubt about this book. So here goes that Mr. Manson."

""Everything worthwhile in life is won through surmounting the associated negative experience. Any attempt to escape the negative, to avoid it or quash it or silence it, only backfires. The avoidance of suffering is a form of suffering. The avoidance of struggle is a struggle. The denial of failure is a failure. Hiding what is shameful is itself a form of shame.Pain is an inextricable thread in the fabric of life, and to tear it out is not only impossible, but destructive: attempting to tear it out unravels everything else with it. To try to avoid pain is to give too many fucks about pain. In contrast, if you’re able to not give a fuck about the pain, you become unstoppable.""
I can't explain how much i love this book. It was even more fun listening to it than reading it. Plus, it's a very short listen; about 6 hours if I remember correctly. It starts off pretty light-hearted and funny with some good points. Then it gets pretty heavy by the end. The last 2 chapter were probably my favorite. It's not a book about giving no fucks at all, only psychopaths and liars don't care about anything, but more so about figuring out what is worthy of the fucks you'll give. Whether you think you give too many fucks or aren't sure what to give a fuck about, read this book. At the very least it's worth using one of your audible credits on. "
87,0062457713,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6168938-zoe,3,Nothing illuminating in this book but it is VERY funny. What the writer wrote about is something we know but often forget. So it was a good reminder for us to focus on the important things. 
88,0062457713,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18989854-krystal,4,"First up, the title is clearly more for shock factor than an accurate title for this book since f*cks are still given, albeit selectively.Second, if bad language, crass stories and vulgar honesty offend you, this may not be an appropriate choice of reading material.Thirdly, these are not particularly new concepts. For alternative reads without the swearing and vulgarity, I'd recommend Daring Greatly: How the Courage to Be Vulnerable Transforms the Way We Live, Love, Parent, and Lead (my 5 star review here) and/or The Courage to be Disliked (my 4 star review here) I'm not a huge fan of swearing etc. myself but this was more about bluntness and simplicity rather than swearing for the sake of it so I didn't mind it quite so much. It's just honest and raw and is quite serious about making its point that no one and nothing is perfect.The point of this book is not to stop 'giving a f*ck', but to choose wisely the things you decide to care about. It raises the fairly common notion that true happiness is beyond the material, and caring about things you can't change (such as others' feelings) will do more harm than good. These ideas are something I definitely connect with, and I do think it's important to take responsibility for your own happiness. Yes, sometimes sh*tty things happen, but you have to find a way through the sh*t to ultimately become stronger, otherwise you're giving up happiness in favour of being a victim.The delivery is certainly not for everyone as there's no sympathy here, and the apathetic will be disappointed because instead of finding a common ideal this book hits with some hard truths. People who are offended easily will find plenty to be offended about, and it's easy to criticise the author for his sexist examples and analogies and the despicable behaviour of his past (which we only know because he has chosen to share). It starts with the message, 'don't try' and concludes with '...and then you die' and in between is a whole lot of 'you are not special', which honestly all sounds quite depressing but it really does make a lot of sense. It tells us we are not special, but then goes on to suggest why that might be so painful to hear. If you are open-minded, you'll understand and perhaps appreciate the wisdom in it; if you're more stubborn you'll close your eyes, cover your ears and repeat to yourself that you are special, no matter what this crappy little book says (thus increasing the pressure on yourself to be special). All in all, the book makes a lot of sense, but you have to be open and accepting enough to appreciate it.Side note: I was really surprised there were no references listed, considering how many names were dropped and psychology experiments referenced etc. Curious.If this rubbed you up the wrong way I'd definitely suggest giving Daring Greatly a chance, as it's a much more comprehensive (and kind) exploration of the same themes.This was book 24 in my #Dymocks52challenge refined.

The book is a reaction to the self-help industry and what Manson saw as a culture of mindless positivity that isn't practical or helpful for most people. Manson uses many of his own personal experiences to illustrate how life's struggles often give it more meaning, which, he argues, is a better approach than constantly trying to be happy. Manson's approach and writing style have been categorized by some as contrarian to the general self-help industry, using blunt honesty and profanity to illustrate his ideas.The book has 9 chapters with the following titles:1. Don't Try.2. Happiness is a problem.3. You are not special.4. The value of suffering.5. You are always choosing.6. You are wrong about everything (But so am I).7. Failure is the way forward.8.

I’ve heard most of it before but the author delivers the message in a concise, sorry-if-it-hurts, straight-forward way.I found some of the advice helpful and I’m glad I read it.

Instead I got a collection of banal insights, wrapped in supposedly funny dirty-talk. References to philosophy/literature were reminiscent of an author who just skimmed through ""100 ideas in X you need to know"" and didn't bother further. They were forced and off-beat especially considering the overall tone, which itself fluctuated between the earnestness of self-help drivel and the tongue-in-cheek of comedy memoirs. Ironically, this was the only convincing argument made to support the point on making choices to narrow down your options. Looks like the author didn’t even follow his own advice."

I listened to the audiobook and was able to get through it in a few days. Now I know why I don't read self help books. I don't know why but it comes across as so pretentious to me, and hearing Mark Manson ramble on for so long about ""not giving a fuck"" and ""only giving a fuck about the things that matter"" it just felt to me like he was trying too hard. Also, he's a privileged white man and some of this felt very douche-y to me. Like him talking about how he tells his wife when she doesn't look good because honesty is more important... like okay.

Book has no originality and better writers have written more brilliantly about these topics. Entire thing boils down to irritating, naive, amateur psychology from a douchebag in serious ignorance of his douchebaggery. The book suffers from the problem of extremes. In this case, in attempting to correct for admittedly nauseating over positivity bullshit, the author is now guilty of the same crap in the opposite direction - an over glorification of suffering. This is just as much of a crap fest as what he claims to be avoiding. Laughable part is that dude is an entitled little shithead who's got no understanding of suffering. There's even more considerable lack of understanding of medical/scientific research and on some level he seems to believe that people with real psychological issues should just get over themselves cause everyone has problems. When a human being gets to a point where he can equate his self imposed drugged infused decade of ""trauma"" stemming from his parents divorce to the real trauma of a father losing his son, that's serious entitled bullshit! To conclude that someone who has suffered through hellish circumstances can just move on based on cherry picked examples of celebrities making it, is pathetically superficial. This kind of crappy thinking is what results in selfish individuals who can only empathize with others if they have gone through similar experiences themselves. Books like this don't move the dial in improving humanity, they just create/justify narcissistic characters who hide their narcissism behind a wall of false self improvement. This author is no different from the cultish positivity people he scorns. He spews the same sanctimonious, bullshit rhetoric where he pats himself on the back by stating how his values help make the world better! His whole unoriginal theory of put on your big boy panties and get over yourself mentality is just as terrible as the whole disappear into some zen bullshit crapfest. It's this kind of mentality that makes people say if I could make it, I don't get why anyone else can't either. It fails to recognize differences in circumstances. I'm all for suck it up and deal with life but the ability to fail to recognize that maybe the dad with the dead kid has suffered more pain than the asshole with the cheating ex girlfriend is ludicrous! What this guy has done is surround himself with folks so obviously dysfunctional, he ends up looking like the king in a world of spectacular ignorance. The question that should be asked as he gives multiple examples of his idiotic friends being assholes, is how has he managed to collect so many terrible people in his circle? What does this say about his values and judgement? In the end, author is no different from his douchebag ""friend"" he described in the earlier chapters except unlike the friend who limited himself to sponging off of relatives, this dude has expanded his narcissistic reach to a wider audience. Still playing the victim of the trauma of his parents divorce, still standing for nothing except the right to say what he wants, when he wants to whoever he wants. There's a word for people like that - douchebag! "
97,0062457713,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16131467-nate-icart,1,"I absolutely hated this book. Reasons why:-The author's jokes were terrible. His style of humor is just to add a random number to an example (""I felt like I was punched 253 times in the stomach""). -Many (most) of the concepts in this book are ripped from common bodies of knowledge (he explains the basic economic concept of opportunity cost like he was the one who discovered it)-His experiences all feel fake. He talks about how came to deep realizations about his life when we was a fresh college graduate -- not that this is impossible, just very unlikely.-The first few chapters have the word ""Fuck"" in them so much that it just feels like he's making excuses to say it. I like swearing, but every time he talks about sex he calls it ""fucking"". No one talks like that.-It's very hard to take a 32 year old self-help guru seriously when they don't have a real life like the rest of us. He's been a world-traveler and an extremely popular blogger for years. He explained that he only held a ""real"" job for 6 weeks post-graduation. Who can relate to this?-The best part about this book is the cover. Manson is good at marketing, and he's good in short-form (like on his blog), but I will never read another book that he writes."

However, the title of this book piqued my curiosity and it perpetually appears on the main page of Audible as a best seller, thus furthering my interest to pick it up. As an audiobook, I did enjoy this quite a fair bit as the narrator was good and brought life to the narrative. Admittedly, the advice contained herein was not ground-breaking, but delivered in a refreshing and humourous manner. It served as a reminder as to what we probably already know in the deep, dark recesses of our minds, but are too caught up in the hectic modern life and excesses for greater inner reflection. I find a few of the real-life examples quoted to be quite relevant and effective.

Who you are is defined by what you're willing to struggle for.

The title is slightly misleading as the book is not so much as to how not to give a f*ck but to choose what is important enough to give a f*ck about. It is about getting our priorities and values right so that we pick the right battles which truly matter in making our lives count for something. If we start giving a f*ck about every little thing, we will end up spending too much energy on trivial matters and being generally uncontented about life. While it is fine not to feel positive all the time, learning how to channel that in the right direction and taking charge of your life where it is possible to make a difference are the essential messages the book is getting across to the reader. The one theme that was discussed which I feel very strongly about was concerning the 'sense of entitlement' and how this can be destructive in the way one views his or her life. And social media is probably the biggest culprit in propagating this negative view to a whole new level. Being constantly bombarded with reality shows, Instagrams and blogs of beautiful people enjoying a beautiful life, we start to ask ""Why can't I be like so-and-so?"" or ""Why can't I have this or that too?"". As a 14-year old niece of mine rightly pointed out, Instagram represents filtered existence. It seems almost natural now for most to block out the unfavourable or darker segments of life or humanity - such as poverty, hunger, war, violence, human trafficking, prostitution, etc. Instead, we moan and groan about the 'unfortunate circumstances' of not being able to own nice cars and big houses, have great clothes and the requisite body to go with it, go on expensive holidays, or obtain that 'much-deserved' promotion at work - the list goes on and on.Anyway, I'm rambling - this is a topic that I can go on and on about, but that's not the point about this review. If you're curious, this is worth a read as it is quite funny and does not take up much time to finish. Even though much of what is said was nothing new, sometimes we just need that extra nudge.This review can also be found at Booknest"
99,0062457713,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5759543-sam-quixote,3,"Eye-catching title, eh? Unfortunately that’s about all that really stands out about Mark Manson’s The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck, which is actually a very ordinary self-help book - and I’ve not even read a lot of self-help books either, that’s how broad, generic and unremarkable a lot of the stuff he talks about here is! Still, its ideas are ultimately positive and worth re-reading and keeping in mind so I can’t say I found the book a total waste of time. The book’s title and main thesis can be summed up as: finding and caring about the shit that matters to you while ignoring the shit that doesn’t - see what I mean when I say it’s unremarkable? But wait, there’s more! Manson has more vapid platitudes like how life’s about the journey, not the destination, how finding meaning in life is better than accumulating material possessions, and that, seeing as we’re all going to die one day, why waste our limited time on shit that doesn’t matter? Not that I disagree with any of that but there’s nothing new or special about that information and you definitely don’t need to read this book to hear that kind of stuff. In fact, you don’t even need to read it anywhere at all as these ideas are so ubiquitous in pop culture as to be cliched! But, like I said, the book also contains useful messages that are worth hearing whether or not you’ve come across them before. Messages like pain and struggle are necessary and unavoidable parts of life. That rising up to challenges and facing hard truths about ourselves help us grow as well as make us stronger at weathering the shit life inevitably throws our way. That failure - so long as we learn from it - eventually leads to success so we shouldn’t be afraid to keep trying even if we’ll probably fail. That dissatisfaction and being uncomfortable are good as they motivate us to change and improve ourselves and our circumstances. I agree that perspective and values are important and that adjusting these can lead to a more satisfying existence. This means accepting that you’ll probably never be rich and famous, that you’re probably not an undiscovered genius or great artist, or that anything you’ll ever do will have any lasting impact on future generations. And that realisation can be freeing to pursue the things that only matter to you.As Manson notes, nothing is certain, which is a profoundly obvious yet difficult lesson I’m slowly learning and re-learning all the time. We also have a tendency to create our own narratives that are confining and are worth exploding as they’re largely bullshit. And I totally agree with and can personally attest that taking more responsibility in your life leads to far greater happiness. Jocko Willink has a similar philosophy: Discipline Equals Freedom. But I don’t buy Manson’s anecdote that when he googled the quote “With great power comes great responsibility” he couldn’t find out who originally said it. As a comics reader, I instantly know it was Spider-Man’s Uncle Ben but I can’t believe a Google search wouldn’t tell him that! He’s right though when he says that excessive freedoms don’t lead to happiness. You only need to look at the toxic Social Justice movement currently poisoning Western politics whose adherents are obsessed with personal freedoms - none of those people are ever happy! His points on the importance of boundaries in relationships and healthy conflict stemming from honesty though were banal and unnecessary. I’m a terrible procrastinator so I really liked the “Do Something” principle where you just do whatever it is you should be doing rather than waiting for the “right moment” or inspiration to strike. The idea is that once you start doing something, especially badly, you’ll eventually start doing it right. Action leads to motivation leads to inspiration leads to success - basically a practical application of not being afraid of failure and one I’ll be trying out myself. I wasn’t that interested in Manson’s autobiographical anecdotes, which were mostly mundane, nor did I find a lot of the examples he chose to illustrate his ideas to be that compelling, though I do like the possibility that Shakespeare wrote Romeo & Juliet as a satire on love especially as so many view it as the ultimate romance story! I also don’t agree that caring less about something means you’ll do better at it or that great people become great because they don’t think they’re great which is why they work harder than most. Both are, like a lot of the statements he makes, an oversimplified generalisation. Maybe he’s right for some but maybe some others already think they’re great and are driven by something else? And, like all self-help books, it needs to be vague enough to be a one-size fits all for the widest possible appeal so I’m not sure how helpful it’s going to be in finding its audience’s meaning in their individual lives - it certainly didn’t mine! But on the whole Manson is a decent writer who’s able to put his ideas across quite clearly in an accessible way. The messaging may be fairly commonplace and underwhelming but I found enough good stuff here to have gotten something out of reading it and if you’ve read no self-help books at all you might find this even more useful! The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck is kinda worth giving a fuck about, just don’t expect much from it. "

101,0062457713,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3643764-esil,4,"3.5 starsI’m not sure what possessed me to listen to this audiobook. I have ZERO interest in self help books. But once I started, I thought it was good enough to keep going.The title is there for shock value, but it’s not a particularly shocking book, unless you’re easily put off by swearing. The author is not really advocating that we all drop everything and run to the beach. He’s arguing for recalibrating what matters to you, and acting on it.The secondary title - “a counterintuitive approach to living a good life” - is deceptive. There’s nothing counterintuitive here. There’s a lot of common sense. But it’s pretty good common sense. And also timely in many ways. So I didn’t have any aha moments, but I nodded my head a fair bit.The question that kept buzzing at the back of my mind is how likely people are to be able to make dramatic changes in their lives by being told to shift the focus on what matters to them. In other words, easier said than done. But still worth thinking about every now and then.I think I’ll stick to my ZERO self help books policy, but this wasn’t a bad foray out of my usual comfort zones."
102,0062457713,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22371819-mariah-roze,4,This was a great book! I've been seeing it everywhere so I wanted to read it. This book was great at reminding you that you shouldn't care what other people think. It is important to do what you want and what your heart wants. It also reminds you that you don't need to be famous or have a spectacular life to have a great life. This is YOUR life. Do what YOU want!
103,0062457713,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45341691-israt-zaman-disha,4,"""The desire for more positive experience is itself a negative experience. And, paradoxically, the acceptance of one’s negative experience is itself a positive experience.""I never thought of reading this book. Saw a hype about it recently in a group on facebook. So I just wanted to know what this book is about. After reading the blurb on goodreads, I thought to give it a go, see what's the hype about. So I started listening to the audiobook. ""Not giving a fuck does not mean being indifferent; it means being comfortable with being different.""First thing I learned from this book is, never judge a book by its cover or title or first chapter. In the first chapter, the author said f*ck like a 100 times. I think there was no need to said that word this many times. I don't have any problem with saying fuck. But when I read/listen to fuck this many times in just one chapter, I cannot help but feel irritated. So yeah, I was irritated but decided to go on. And I am glad of my decision. ""Maturity is what happens when one learns to only give a fuck about what’s truly fuckworthy.""I don't think this book is an inspiring one. The writer didn't want to tell people how to be motivated or how to be a successful person. He simply told how to be happy in life. What is the mantra behind peace and happiness in one's life. And I have to say I totally agree. And that mantra is not giving a fuck. Well, now some may think that not giving a fuck means being indifferent to everything. But that's not true. There's a very thin line between being indifferent and being indifferent to the things that are not important in life. Mark Manson talked about this difference and how we care about everything. In this book, he shared many of his thoughts about happiness, emotion, sufferings, values, responsibilities, rejections, and relations of our life. And I agree with most of the things he said. You can say I am bragging but I found that my thoughts and ideas about life are a lot like Mark Manson. And yes I was lame and pathetic once. But I am growing. I am learning the subtle art of not giving a fuck. ""Being wrong opens us up to the possibility of change. Being wrong brings the opportunity for growth.""One thing I love while reading something is when I find some character I can relate to real life. And this book was full of it. Sometimes I find someone who is exactly like my friend, then someone pretty much like my boss and finally someone a lot like me. It was a major point why I liked this book. ""There is a simple realization from which all personal improvement and growth emerge. This is the realization that we, individually, are responsible for everything in our lives, no matter the external circumstances. We don’t always control what happens to us. But we always control how we interpret what happens to us, as well as how we respond. Whether we consciously recognize it or not, we are always responsible for our experiences.""There's one thing that I didn't understand the last chapter. And I was thinking of giving a star less for it. Then I thought maybe I haven't grown that much yet. So yeah I will reread the last chapter after two or three years and see if it makes any sense. So 5 stars for now... :D ""To be happy we need something to solve. Happiness is, therefore, a form of action..."""

The things mentioned in the book are logical and make immense sense, they're also presented with interesting and sometimes personal issues to get the idea. Manson's writing is straight to the point and natural; it flows like a conversation rather than a self-help rant. All this, and I still couldn't find much enthusiasm for the things being said because I find them to be basic things that I've always believed. It did give me a few things to consider and maybe look up, but I don't get why people keep telling me that it's ""life changing."""

It’s less about not giving a fuck and more about what is worth giving a fuck about. And there are things that are worth giving a fuck about! In fact, Manson tells us that having problems is a good thing… only it’s important that we fill our lives mostly with problems that we want to have. Sound confusing? Read the book. He’ll also hit it home that life isn’t fair or easy, and it’s not supposed to be.

I am not much into self-help books. When I started to read this book, I knew immediately I would love it. This book doesn't sugarcoat anything. It's blunt, true, and makes you realize not to waste your emotional energy. You should know when and where you should give a fuck and when or where you shouldn't. It will make life a lot different, in a positive way. I would definitely recommend this book."

They're usually written by preachy, entitled people who believe they've ""made it"" telling you what to do and how to think, as if you're a brainless amoeba lapping up their greatness. This book is no different. Filled mainly with questionable anecdotes and retellings of things we already know, I kept on reading for some actual substance. It starts off well enough, but descends into a baseless think piece from the perspective of an entitled white male.

BUT Mark Manson had a wonderful approach to his book. He is just a normal person without all that Botox and designer jeans that made his butt look bigger telling me he has many things HE has to work on a daily basis and what he had to overcome to not be a piece of shit psycho. I had to return the book to its rightful owner so I can't pick out my favorite quotes (and I'm not buying it for $30) but this book is very quotable and very raw.I have always known I am a people pleaser and I really hate that trait about me because I put myself in awkward positions and then resent the person I want to help because 1. They weren't grateful enough 2. They will never ever return the favor 3. They turned out to be shitty people. 4. I am just annoyed!So yes, it okay to say NO to people. I don't have to care about every little cause and I should definitely have my priorities straight. Stop being fake and surround yourself with people that are meaningful to you. Just do and see what happens from there. You are not unique and your problems are not unique so once you realize this you can just live your life without that carrot dangling over your sleep. With failure you learn about who you are and can grow as a person. Just because you failed at something doesn't mean you are a failure. Social media life is fake so you are not pathetic for not eating at Spago for lunch or being in the Caribbean this year. Be true to the person you want to be. There was more to it and Manson had some great stories in there. My Negatives- He said ""Fuck"" wwwaaayyy too much. I get it. That's the damn title of the book.Sometimes got repetitive.Overall- recommend."

I wouldn’t normally reach for a self help book, but Mark Moran’s The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck: A Counterintuitive Approach to Living a Good Life, was the pick for our book club this month. It also formed part of challenge read on 'read a self help guide' I have going with a fellow bookworm. I decided to give this book a chance and I went into reading it with an open mind, despite my reservations about the bold title. I surprised myself by enjoying this book. I found it a highly readable, direct, humorous and relatable guide. I wouldn’t say this is a self help book as such, but more a strategy in self evaluation. Many of the ideas and approaches Moran suggests we should take to change our lives are simple to implement and most probably have in the back of our minds – yet Moran suggest what we lack is courage to act on this. What Moran does is put these ideas in spotlight and his book works to give the reader the encouragement needed to put his notions into practice. What I appreciated the most about The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck was insertion of real life stories within this text. Moran linked his approaches to concrete scenarios, which gave his guide much more brevity. From the author Moran’s own back story from hitting rock bottom to becoming a blogger extraordinaire, to celebrity examples such as former Beatles drummer Pete Best and even World War II survivours - the message is clear in all cases. What almost breaks you may in fact make you a stronger, happier and better person. "

I am one of those whom are fed up with all those toxic self-development books. That type of books like: How to achieve greatness, How to win and influence people, how to be rich, etc, etc. This book is completely as it states the ""Counterintuitive approach to Living a Good Life"", the, as I'd love to put it, ""Anti-Self development book of really good life"". So whatever reader are you, this book is for you!""The Subtle Art of Not Giving A F*ck""The moment you read the title you think: ""Really! Could this even be a title?!""A title that will either scare you out to give it a try, or will burn your eagerness to know what it is all about. To be honest, I am freaked out to write a review about this book. I finished the book a day earlier but had no guts to start on writing a review. But as I recently feel obliged to write a review about every single book that I read, thus it seemed inevitable to write it sooner or later. So here we go. Fasten your seat belt!If you have ever heard of Charles Bukowski, Buddha, Hiroo Onoda, Norio Suzuki, Dave Mustaine, Pete Best, William James, Malala Yousafzai, Meredith Maran, Pablo Picasso, Romeo & Juliet, Ernest Becker, then trust me, you will learn their stories again in a very different way that will seize your mind and leave you completely astonished.This book will help you know why all the other self-development books didn't help you or anyone else through the principle of the Feedback Loop from Hell.It will tell you why we are always searching for the happiness and what should the true happiness be from everyone's own perspective.Moreover it will accuse you, and me, of overrating certain life aspects. You will also get to meet the Disappointment Panda and figure out how would you deal with him.You will learn by yourself how everyone is given to choose their own struggles.You will know that it is not a must to me the superhero and the very special person in that exaggerating behavior, in a matter of fact, thus everyone should be one! Nevertheless not lowering or diminishing the value of being one!It will tear you apart while knowing the value of suffering, the shitty values and great values through The Self-Awarness Onion.Furthermore, it will condemn you of your responsibilities and all the freedom of choice you have.

Last but not least, It will grab you by the arm to know that failure, pain and rejection are part of the process by getting to know the Do Something principle.
This book is about everything in your life. It isn't limited to career topics or relationship styling. But rather to a higher and more intellectual state of mind and reason. This book is for you!This book is not rocket science, it doesn't inform us of new matters that were unknown to us. Rather it tells you exactly what you already know, what is standing right in front of your nose, down in simple, friendly, invasive words that will leave you seeing things much more different than before.I have made it across a lot of various books, but this book is surely different. I believe this book was the hit on the head that I urgely needed to wake up and sort things out differently and to view all my priorities and values with an entirely conscious mind. And to put all my life, past and future, into question!This book will drive you to get hurt facing the inevitable truth, will make you show up your deepest wounds, will leave you in anger, rage and tears depending on what you have encountered in life and the VALUES you are living by.P.S.

I think it's an attempt to piggyback on the success of Marie Kondo's book by being ""inspired"" by the title and hoping people will pay money without looking too hard at the contents of the book."

Mark Manson really speaks the truth and talks about important issues that are part of our lives.

Everyone in this room is now dumber for having listened to it. I award you no points Mr Manson, and may God have mercy on your soul."
115,0062457713,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31777090-sohaib,4,"This book is about setting and honing personal values. It's about determining what to give a fuck about in your life. In Manson's witty words, managing the amount of fucks you give. Minimizing the scope of your interests really—to the essentials. Putting all of your eggs in that one basket. Figuring out what that basket is in the first place. Does that make sense?I enjoyed a couple of ideas. One of them is on the importance of cultivating doubt. Manson claims that uncertainty is the way forward and that the key to personal growth lies in being comfortable with it. The comfort breeds an openness that obliterates sticking to rigid values and motivates us towards positive change. Uncertainty breaks the entitlement chain, the belief that you're a special snowflake who deserves special treatment from the world—the naivety of expecting something for nothing, to be loved for doing nothing, to be appreciated for doing nothing, and so on. To break the hold of the spell of certainty and entitlement, Mr. Manson proposes asking yourself three golden questions:1- What if I'm wrong? 2- What would it mean if I'm wrong? 3- Would me being wrong create better problems? I tried them for size and trust me, the sheer entertaining of the possibility of being wrong is refreshing. Also wonderful in cultivating compassion, humility, and acceptance of oneself and others. The success formula Manson proposes goes something like this:Happiness comes from solving problems, and the quality of your problems is determined by the quality of your values and metrics, the standards by which you measure your success. Naturally, the better the problems, the more successful you are. Good problems come from having good values and metrics. And so Manson dedicates more than half of his book to what he sees as the five most important values, and he summarizes them on page 89 in one paragraph:""The first ... is a radical form of responsibility: taking responsibility for everything that occurs in your life, regardless of who's at fault. The second is uncertainty: the acknowledgment of your own ignorance and the cultivation of constant doubt in your own beliefs. The next is failure ... The fourth is rejection: the ability to both say and hear no ... The final value is the contemplation of one's own mortality.""Another idea that stuck is the Do Something Principle, the idea that action can and sometimes should precede motivation. This reminded me of Ralph Waldo Emerson's famous quote: ""Do the thing and you shall have the power."" Most of us, unfortunately, spend our entire lives waiting for that power to come down, waiting for the muse instead of moving in the direction of our dreams. Action > Inspiration > Motivation > Action... (Loop) In the end, The Subtle Art is a sobering unconventional take on self-help, and I recommend it for people looking for just that. Three stars and a half, with a grain of salt. My rating came down from four and a half thanks to me cultivating doubt about this book. So here goes that Mr. Manson."

""Everything worthwhile in life is won through surmounting the associated negative experience. Any attempt to escape the negative, to avoid it or quash it or silence it, only backfires. The avoidance of suffering is a form of suffering. The avoidance of struggle is a struggle. The denial of failure is a failure. Hiding what is shameful is itself a form of shame.Pain is an inextricable thread in the fabric of life, and to tear it out is not only impossible, but destructive: attempting to tear it out unravels everything else with it. To try to avoid pain is to give too many fucks about pain. In contrast, if you’re able to not give a fuck about the pain, you become unstoppable.""
I can't explain how much i love this book. It was even more fun listening to it than reading it. Plus, it's a very short listen; about 6 hours if I remember correctly. It starts off pretty light-hearted and funny with some good points. Then it gets pretty heavy by the end. The last 2 chapter were probably my favorite. It's not a book about giving no fucks at all, only psychopaths and liars don't care about anything, but more so about figuring out what is worthy of the fucks you'll give. Whether you think you give too many fucks or aren't sure what to give a fuck about, read this book. At the very least it's worth using one of your audible credits on. "
117,0062457713,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6168938-zoe,3,Nothing illuminating in this book but it is VERY funny. What the writer wrote about is something we know but often forget. So it was a good reminder for us to focus on the important things. 
118,0062457713,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18989854-krystal,4,"First up, the title is clearly more for shock factor than an accurate title for this book since f*cks are still given, albeit selectively.Second, if bad language, crass stories and vulgar honesty offend you, this may not be an appropriate choice of reading material.Thirdly, these are not particularly new concepts. For alternative reads without the swearing and vulgarity, I'd recommend Daring Greatly: How the Courage to Be Vulnerable Transforms the Way We Live, Love, Parent, and Lead (my 5 star review here) and/or The Courage to be Disliked (my 4 star review here) I'm not a huge fan of swearing etc. myself but this was more about bluntness and simplicity rather than swearing for the sake of it so I didn't mind it quite so much. It's just honest and raw and is quite serious about making its point that no one and nothing is perfect.The point of this book is not to stop 'giving a f*ck', but to choose wisely the things you decide to care about. It raises the fairly common notion that true happiness is beyond the material, and caring about things you can't change (such as others' feelings) will do more harm than good. These ideas are something I definitely connect with, and I do think it's important to take responsibility for your own happiness. Yes, sometimes sh*tty things happen, but you have to find a way through the sh*t to ultimately become stronger, otherwise you're giving up happiness in favour of being a victim.The delivery is certainly not for everyone as there's no sympathy here, and the apathetic will be disappointed because instead of finding a common ideal this book hits with some hard truths. People who are offended easily will find plenty to be offended about, and it's easy to criticise the author for his sexist examples and analogies and the despicable behaviour of his past (which we only know because he has chosen to share). It starts with the message, 'don't try' and concludes with '...and then you die' and in between is a whole lot of 'you are not special', which honestly all sounds quite depressing but it really does make a lot of sense. It tells us we are not special, but then goes on to suggest why that might be so painful to hear. If you are open-minded, you'll understand and perhaps appreciate the wisdom in it; if you're more stubborn you'll close your eyes, cover your ears and repeat to yourself that you are special, no matter what this crappy little book says (thus increasing the pressure on yourself to be special). All in all, the book makes a lot of sense, but you have to be open and accepting enough to appreciate it.Side note: I was really surprised there were no references listed, considering how many names were dropped and psychology experiments referenced etc. Curious.If this rubbed you up the wrong way I'd definitely suggest giving Daring Greatly a chance, as it's a much more comprehensive (and kind) exploration of the same themes.This was book 24 in my #Dymocks52challenge refined.

The book is a reaction to the self-help industry and what Manson saw as a culture of mindless positivity that isn't practical or helpful for most people. Manson uses many of his own personal experiences to illustrate how life's struggles often give it more meaning, which, he argues, is a better approach than constantly trying to be happy. Manson's approach and writing style have been categorized by some as contrarian to the general self-help industry, using blunt honesty and profanity to illustrate his ideas.The book has 9 chapters with the following titles:1.

I was totally into reading it and it seemed great at first, but truthfully, for me, the best chapters were the last two.

Surprisingly, oftentimes, I ended up getting ''into'' whatever action I was performing that I initially wanted to avoid. So I agree that action can bring about inspiration which can lead to motivation. "

I like to browse this list because it shows you what people are actually reading instead of just what people are buying.I find the list more useful than other bestsellers’ list because it tells me which books are engaging people, after all, we’ve all picked up a title and abandoned it after a few pages because it wasn’t interesting or compelling.So, I went ahead and borrowed it from the library. This book offers a is a zero-nonsense approach to self-help concepts. I’ve heard most of it before but the author delivers the message in a concise, sorry-if-it-hurts, straight-forward way.I found some of the advice helpful and I’m glad I read it. I understand now why it might resonate with many people and recommend it to those always seeking to improve themselves."
124,0062457713,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20214132-crankmuffin,2,"I was expecting an enjoyable read on not taking things too seriously. Instead I got a collection of banal insights, wrapped in supposedly funny dirty-talk. References to philosophy/literature were reminiscent of an author who just skimmed through ""100 ideas in X you need to know"" and didn't bother further. They were forced and off-beat especially considering the overall tone, which itself fluctuated between the earnestness of self-help drivel and the tongue-in-cheek of comedy memoirs. Ironically, this was the only convincing argument made to support the point on making choices to narrow down your options. Looks like the author didn’t even follow his own advice."
125,0062457713,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26560207-gabby,2,"I don't read a lot of self help books. In fact, I don't think I've ever read one before this. But I've seen this one floating around and it's been getting some great reviews so I got curious and decided to check this one out. I listened to the audiobook and was able to get through it in a few days. Now I know why I don't read self help books. I don't know why but it comes across as so pretentious to me, and hearing Mark Manson ramble on for so long about ""not giving a fuck"" and ""only giving a fuck about the things that matter"" it just felt to me like he was trying too hard. Also, he's a privileged white man and some of this felt very douche-y to me. Like him talking about how he tells his wife when she doesn't look good because honesty is more important... like okay. I just didn't enjoy this the way I thought I might. I don't think self help books are for me. "
126,0062457713,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5632120-zaphoddent,1,"Catchy title but fails to deliver on anything concrete. Book has no originality and better writers have written more brilliantly about these topics. Entire thing boils down to irritating, naive, amateur psychology from a douchebag in serious ignorance of his douchebaggery. The book suffers from the problem of extremes. In this case, in attempting to correct for admittedly nauseating over positivity bullshit, the author is now guilty of the same crap in the opposite direction - an over glorification of suffering. This is just as much of a crap fest as what he claims to be avoiding. Laughable part is that dude is an entitled little shithead who's got no understanding of suffering. There's even more considerable lack of understanding of medical/scientific research and on some level he seems to believe that people with real psychological issues should just get over themselves cause everyone has problems. When a human being gets to a point where he can equate his self imposed drugged infused decade of ""trauma"" stemming from his parents divorce to the real trauma of a father losing his son, that's serious entitled bullshit! To conclude that someone who has suffered through hellish circumstances can just move on based on cherry picked examples of celebrities making it, is pathetically superficial. This kind of crappy thinking is what results in selfish individuals who can only empathize with others if they have gone through similar experiences themselves. Books like this don't move the dial in improving humanity, they just create/justify narcissistic characters who hide their narcissism behind a wall of false self improvement. This author is no different from the cultish positivity people he scorns. He spews the same sanctimonious, bullshit rhetoric where he pats himself on the back by stating how his values help make the world better! His whole unoriginal theory of put on your big boy panties and get over yourself mentality is just as terrible as the whole disappear into some zen bullshit crapfest. It's this kind of mentality that makes people say if I could make it, I don't get why anyone else can't either. It fails to recognize differences in circumstances. I'm all for suck it up and deal with life but the ability to fail to recognize that maybe the dad with the dead kid has suffered more pain than the asshole with the cheating ex girlfriend is ludicrous! What this guy has done is surround himself with folks so obviously dysfunctional, he ends up looking like the king in a world of spectacular ignorance. The question that should be asked as he gives multiple examples of his idiotic friends being assholes, is how has he managed to collect so many terrible people in his circle? What does this say about his values and judgement? In the end, author is no different from his douchebag ""friend"" he described in the earlier chapters except unlike the friend who limited himself to sponging off of relatives, this dude has expanded his narcissistic reach to a wider audience. Still playing the victim of the trauma of his parents divorce, still standing for nothing except the right to say what he wants, when he wants to whoever he wants. There's a word for people like that - douchebag! "
127,0062457713,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16131467-nate-icart,1,"I absolutely hated this book. Reasons why:-The author's jokes were terrible. His style of humor is just to add a random number to an example (""I felt like I was punched 253 times in the stomach""). -Many (most) of the concepts in this book are ripped from common bodies of knowledge (he explains the basic economic concept of opportunity cost like he was the one who discovered it)-His experiences all feel fake. He talks about how came to deep realizations about his life when we was a fresh college graduate -- not that this is impossible, just very unlikely.-The first few chapters have the word ""Fuck"" in them so much that it just feels like he's making excuses to say it. I like swearing, but every time he talks about sex he calls it ""fucking"". No one talks like that.-It's very hard to take a 32 year old self-help guru seriously when they don't have a real life like the rest of us. He's been a world-traveler and an extremely popular blogger for years. He explained that he only held a ""real"" job for 6 weeks post-graduation. Who can relate to this?-The best part about this book is the cover. Manson is good at marketing, and he's good in short-form (like on his blog), but I will never read another book that he writes."
128,0062457713,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30279227-ts-chan,3,"3.5 stars.I don't usually reach for self-help books. However, the title of this book piqued my curiosity and it perpetually appears on the main page of Audible as a best seller, thus furthering my interest to pick it up. As an audiobook, I did enjoy this quite a fair bit as the narrator was good and brought life to the narrative. Admittedly, the advice contained herein was not ground-breaking, but delivered in a refreshing and humourous manner. It served as a reminder as to what we probably already know in the deep, dark recesses of our minds, but are too caught up in the hectic modern life and excesses for greater inner reflection. I find a few of the real-life examples quoted to be quite relevant and effective.

Who you are is defined by what you're willing to struggle for.

The title is slightly misleading as the book is not so much as to how not to give a f*ck but to choose what is important enough to give a f*ck about. It is about getting our priorities and values right so that we pick the right battles which truly matter in making our lives count for something. If we start giving a f*ck about every little thing, we will end up spending too much energy on trivial matters and being generally uncontented about life. While it is fine not to feel positive all the time, learning how to channel that in the right direction and taking charge of your life where it is possible to make a difference are the essential messages the book is getting across to the reader. The one theme that was discussed which I feel very strongly about was concerning the 'sense of entitlement' and how this can be destructive in the way one views his or her life. And social media is probably the biggest culprit in propagating this negative view to a whole new level. Being constantly bombarded with reality shows, Instagrams and blogs of beautiful people enjoying a beautiful life, we start to ask ""Why can't I be like so-and-so?"" or ""Why can't I have this or that too?"". As a 14-year old niece of mine rightly pointed out, Instagram represents filtered existence. It seems almost natural now for most to block out the unfavourable or darker segments of life or humanity - such as poverty, hunger, war, violence, human trafficking, prostitution, etc. Instead, we moan and groan about the 'unfortunate circumstances' of not being able to own nice cars and big houses, have great clothes and the requisite body to go with it, go on expensive holidays, or obtain that 'much-deserved' promotion at work - the list goes on and on.Anyway, I'm rambling - this is a topic that I can go on and on about, but that's not the point about this review. If you're curious, this is worth a read as it is quite funny and does not take up much time to finish. Even though much of what is said was nothing new, sometimes we just need that extra nudge.This review can also be found at Booknest"
129,0062457713,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5759543-sam-quixote,3,"Eye-catching title, eh? Unfortunately that’s about all that really stands out about Mark Manson’s The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck, which is actually a very ordinary self-help book - and I’ve not even read a lot of self-help books either, that’s how broad, generic and unremarkable a lot of the stuff he talks about here is! Still, its ideas are ultimately positive and worth re-reading and keeping in mind so I can’t say I found the book a total waste of time. The book’s title and main thesis can be summed up as: finding and caring about the shit that matters to you while ignoring the shit that doesn’t - see what I mean when I say it’s unremarkable? But wait, there’s more! Manson has more vapid platitudes like how life’s about the journey, not the destination, how finding meaning in life is better than accumulating material possessions, and that, seeing as we’re all going to die one day, why waste our limited time on shit that doesn’t matter? Not that I disagree with any of that but there’s nothing new or special about that information and you definitely don’t need to read this book to hear that kind of stuff. In fact, you don’t even need to read it anywhere at all as these ideas are so ubiquitous in pop culture as to be cliched! But, like I said, the book also contains useful messages that are worth hearing whether or not you’ve come across them before. Messages like pain and struggle are necessary and unavoidable parts of life. That rising up to challenges and facing hard truths about ourselves help us grow as well as make us stronger at weathering the shit life inevitably throws our way. That failure - so long as we learn from it - eventually leads to success so we shouldn’t be afraid to keep trying even if we’ll probably fail. That dissatisfaction and being uncomfortable are good as they motivate us to change and improve ourselves and our circumstances. I agree that perspective and values are important and that adjusting these can lead to a more satisfying existence. This means accepting that you’ll probably never be rich and famous, that you’re probably not an undiscovered genius or great artist, or that anything you’ll ever do will have any lasting impact on future generations. And that realisation can be freeing to pursue the things that only matter to you.As Manson notes, nothing is certain, which is a profoundly obvious yet difficult lesson I’m slowly learning and re-learning all the time. We also have a tendency to create our own narratives that are confining and are worth exploding as they’re largely bullshit. And I totally agree with and can personally attest that taking more responsibility in your life leads to far greater happiness. Jocko Willink has a similar philosophy: Discipline Equals Freedom. But I don’t buy Manson’s anecdote that when he googled the quote “With great power comes great responsibility” he couldn’t find out who originally said it. As a comics reader, I instantly know it was Spider-Man’s Uncle Ben but I can’t believe a Google search wouldn’t tell him that! He’s right though when he says that excessive freedoms don’t lead to happiness. You only need to look at the toxic Social Justice movement currently poisoning Western politics whose adherents are obsessed with personal freedoms - none of those people are ever happy! His points on the importance of boundaries in relationships and healthy conflict stemming from honesty though were banal and unnecessary. I’m a terrible procrastinator so I really liked the “Do Something” principle where you just do whatever it is you should be doing rather than waiting for the “right moment” or inspiration to strike. The idea is that once you start doing something, especially badly, you’ll eventually start doing it right. Action leads to motivation leads to inspiration leads to success - basically a practical application of not being afraid of failure and one I’ll be trying out myself. I wasn’t that interested in Manson’s autobiographical anecdotes, which were mostly mundane, nor did I find a lot of the examples he chose to illustrate his ideas to be that compelling, though I do like the possibility that Shakespeare wrote Romeo & Juliet as a satire on love especially as so many view it as the ultimate romance story! I also don’t agree that caring less about something means you’ll do better at it or that great people become great because they don’t think they’re great which is why they work harder than most. Both are, like a lot of the statements he makes, an oversimplified generalisation. Maybe he’s right for some but maybe some others already think they’re great and are driven by something else? And, like all self-help books, it needs to be vague enough to be a one-size fits all for the widest possible appeal so I’m not sure how helpful it’s going to be in finding its audience’s meaning in their individual lives - it certainly didn’t mine! But on the whole Manson is a decent writer who’s able to put his ideas across quite clearly in an accessible way. The messaging may be fairly commonplace and underwhelming but I found enough good stuff here to have gotten something out of reading it and if you’ve read no self-help books at all you might find this even more useful! The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck is kinda worth giving a fuck about, just don’t expect much from it. "

So I haven't read this book yet, but here's a short play about one of the most ridiculous encounters regarding this book.Hesitant Customer (without children - this is important): ""Could I please see the Subtle Art of not Giving a....""Jen: ""Fuck?""Indignant Customer: ""Yes.""The customer flips through the book. Her lip curls at the sight of ""shit"" and her eyebrows furrow at every ""fuck"" thrown by Mark Manson.Condescending Customer: ""Is there a version of this book without cursing?

The purpose of the book is to stop worrying about bullshit and fuckery that you worry about in life. If you're worried about the word ""fuck"", you need this book more than anyone else.

131,0062457713,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3643764-esil,4,"3.5 starsI’m not sure what possessed me to listen to this audiobook. I have ZERO interest in self help books. But once I started, I thought it was good enough to keep going.The title is there for shock value, but it’s not a particularly shocking book, unless you’re easily put off by swearing. The author is not really advocating that we all drop everything and run to the beach. He’s arguing for recalibrating what matters to you, and acting on it.The secondary title - “a counterintuitive approach to living a good life” - is deceptive. There’s nothing counterintuitive here. There’s a lot of common sense. But it’s pretty good common sense. And also timely in many ways. So I didn’t have any aha moments, but I nodded my head a fair bit.The question that kept buzzing at the back of my mind is how likely people are to be able to make dramatic changes in their lives by being told to shift the focus on what matters to them. In other words, easier said than done. But still worth thinking about every now and then.I think I’ll stick to my ZERO self help books policy, but this wasn’t a bad foray out of my usual comfort zones."
132,0062457713,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22371819-mariah-roze,4,This was a great book! I've been seeing it everywhere so I wanted to read it. This book was great at reminding you that you shouldn't care what other people think. It is important to do what you want and what your heart wants. It also reminds you that you don't need to be famous or have a spectacular life to have a great life. This is YOUR life. Do what YOU want!
133,0062457713,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45341691-israt-zaman-disha,4,"""The desire for more positive experience is itself a negative experience. And, paradoxically, the acceptance of one’s negative experience is itself a positive experience.""I never thought of reading this book. Saw a hype about it recently in a group on facebook. So I just wanted to know what this book is about. After reading the blurb on goodreads, I thought to give it a go, see what's the hype about. So I started listening to the audiobook. ""Not giving a fuck does not mean being indifferent; it means being comfortable with being different.""First thing I learned from this book is, never judge a book by its cover or title or first chapter. In the first chapter, the author said f*ck like a 100 times. I think there was no need to said that word this many times. I don't have any problem with saying fuck. But when I read/listen to fuck this many times in just one chapter, I cannot help but feel irritated. So yeah, I was irritated but decided to go on. And I am glad of my decision. ""Maturity is what happens when one learns to only give a fuck about what’s truly fuckworthy.""I don't think this book is an inspiring one. The writer didn't want to tell people how to be motivated or how to be a successful person. He simply told how to be happy in life. What is the mantra behind peace and happiness in one's life. And I have to say I totally agree. And that mantra is not giving a fuck. Well, now some may think that not giving a fuck means being indifferent to everything. But that's not true. There's a very thin line between being indifferent and being indifferent to the things that are not important in life. Mark Manson talked about this difference and how we care about everything. In this book, he shared many of his thoughts about happiness, emotion, sufferings, values, responsibilities, rejections, and relations of our life. And I agree with most of the things he said. You can say I am bragging but I found that my thoughts and ideas about life are a lot like Mark Manson. And yes I was lame and pathetic once. But I am growing. I am learning the subtle art of not giving a fuck. ""Being wrong opens us up to the possibility of change. Being wrong brings the opportunity for growth.""One thing I love while reading something is when I find some character I can relate to real life. And this book was full of it. Sometimes I find someone who is exactly like my friend, then someone pretty much like my boss and finally someone a lot like me. It was a major point why I liked this book. ""There is a simple realization from which all personal improvement and growth emerge. This is the realization that we, individually, are responsible for everything in our lives, no matter the external circumstances. We don’t always control what happens to us. But we always control how we interpret what happens to us, as well as how we respond. Whether we consciously recognize it or not, we are always responsible for our experiences.""There's one thing that I didn't understand the last chapter. And I was thinking of giving a star less for it. Then I thought maybe I haven't grown that much yet. So yeah I will reread the last chapter after two or three years and see if it makes any sense. So 5 stars for now... :D ""To be happy we need something to solve. Happiness is, therefore, a form of action..."""
134,0062457713,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38414168-ashish-iyer,2,"It starts off really well but then starts to drag out. The things mentioned in the book are logical and make immense sense, they're also presented with interesting and sometimes personal issues to get the idea. Manson's writing is straight to the point and natural; it flows like a conversation rather than a self-help rant. All this, and I still couldn't find much enthusiasm for the things being said because I find them to be basic things that I've always believed. It did give me a few things to consider and maybe look up, but I don't get why people keep telling me that it's ""life changing."""

It’s less about not giving a fuck and more about what is worth giving a fuck about. And there are things that are worth giving a fuck about! In fact, Manson tells us that having problems is a good thing… only it’s important that we fill our lives mostly with problems that we want to have. Sound confusing? Read the book. He’ll also hit it home that life isn’t fair or easy, and it’s not supposed to be. In fact, if it was you’d be bored to death and would be way less happy than you think you’d be.— Wallace Yovetichfrom The Best Books We Read In January 2017: http://bookriot.com/2017/02/01/riot-r...

I even highlighted tons of favorite quotes from this book, whenever I feel anxious, stressed, or depressed I read those quote and trust me it really ease my mind.“Who you are is defined by what you’re willing to struggle for.” The funny thing is I had no expectation from this book, I just decided to read it because I've seen many people were talking about this book. I am not much into self-help books. When I started to read this book, I knew immediately I would love it. This book doesn't sugarcoat anything. It's blunt, true, and makes you realize not to waste your emotional energy. You should know when and where you should give a fuck and when or where you shouldn't.

They're usually written by preachy, entitled people who believe they've ""made it"" telling you what to do and how to think, as if you're a brainless amoeba lapping up their greatness. This book is no different. Filled mainly with questionable anecdotes and retellings of things we already know, I kept on reading for some actual substance.

So, lots of advice that most of us probably already know, but will still likely leave you feeling motivated."
139,0062457713,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62428250-karina,4,"First off, I am not much of a self-help reader: not because I think I am perfect and have nothing to learn about myself but because it usually feels like it's a know-it-all slimy salesman telling me what is ""wrong"" with the person I am. BUT Mark Manson had a wonderful approach to his book. He is just a normal person without all that Botox and designer jeans that made his butt look bigger telling me he has many things HE has to work on a daily basis and what he had to overcome to not be a piece of shit psycho. I had to return the book to its rightful owner so I can't pick out my favorite quotes (and I'm not buying it for $30) but this book is very quotable and very raw.I have always known I am a people pleaser and I really hate that trait about me because I put myself in awkward positions and then resent the person I want to help because 1. They weren't grateful enough 2. They will never ever return the favor 3. They turned out to be shitty people. 4. I am just annoyed!So yes, it okay to say NO to people. I don't have to care about every little cause and I should definitely have my priorities straight. Stop being fake and surround yourself with people that are meaningful to you. Just do and see what happens from there. You are not unique and your problems are not unique so once you realize this you can just live your life without that carrot dangling over your sleep. With failure you learn about who you are and can grow as a person. Just because you failed at something doesn't mean you are a failure. Social media life is fake so you are not pathetic for not eating at Spago for lunch or being in the Caribbean this year. Be true to the person you want to be. There was more to it and Manson had some great stories in there. My Negatives- He said ""Fuck"" wwwaaayyy too much. I get it. That's the damn title of the book.Sometimes got repetitive.Overall- recommend."

I wouldn’t normally reach for a self help book, but Mark Moran’s The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck: A Counterintuitive Approach to Living a Good Life, was the pick for our book club this month. It also formed part of challenge read on 'read a self help guide' I have going with a fellow bookworm. I decided to give this book a chance and I went into reading it with an open mind, despite my reservations about the bold title. I surprised myself by enjoying this book. I found it a highly readable, direct, humorous and relatable guide. I wouldn’t say this is a self help book as such, but more a strategy in self evaluation. Many of the ideas and approaches Moran suggests we should take to change our lives are simple to implement and most probably have in the back of our minds – yet Moran suggest what we lack is courage to act on this. What Moran does is put these ideas in spotlight and his book works to give the reader the encouragement needed to put his notions into practice. What I appreciated the most about The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck was insertion of real life stories within this text. Moran linked his approaches to concrete scenarios, which gave his guide much more brevity. From the author Moran’s own back story from hitting rock bottom to becoming a blogger extraordinaire, to celebrity examples such as former Beatles drummer Pete Best and even World War II survivours - the message is clear in all cases. What almost breaks you may in fact make you a stronger, happier and better person. "

For me, I am the Anti-Self-Development type, however, sometimes I give a book or two a chance to make a difference and change my mind. And that truly rarely or never happens. I am one of those whom are fed up with all those toxic self-development books. That type of books like: How to achieve greatness, How to win and influence people, how to be rich, etc, etc. This book is completely as it states the ""Counterintuitive approach to Living a Good Life"", the, as I'd love to put it, ""Anti-Self development book of really good life"". So whatever reader are you, this book is for you!""The Subtle Art of Not Giving A F*ck""The moment you read the title you think: ""Really! Could this even be a title?!""A title that will either scare you out to give it a try, or will burn your eagerness to know what it is all about. To be honest, I am freaked out to write a review about this book. I finished the book a day earlier but had no guts to start on writing a review. But as I recently feel obliged to write a review about every single book that I read, thus it seemed inevitable to write it sooner or later. So here we go. Fasten your seat belt!If you have ever heard of Charles Bukowski, Buddha, Hiroo Onoda, Norio Suzuki, Dave Mustaine, Pete Best, William James, Malala Yousafzai, Meredith Maran, Pablo Picasso, Romeo & Juliet, Ernest Becker, then trust me, you will learn their stories again in a very different way that will seize your mind and leave you completely astonished.This book will help you know why all the other self-development books didn't help you or anyone else through the principle of the Feedback Loop from Hell.It will tell you why we are always searching for the happiness and what should the true happiness be from everyone's own perspective.Moreover it will accuse you, and me, of overrating certain life aspects. You will also get to meet the Disappointment Panda and figure out how would you deal with him.You will learn by yourself how everyone is given to choose their own struggles.You will know that it is not a must to me the superhero and the very special person in that exaggerating behavior, in a matter of fact, thus everyone should be one! Nevertheless not lowering or diminishing the value of being one!It will tear you apart while knowing the value of suffering, the shitty values and great values through The Self-Awarness Onion.Furthermore, it will condemn you of your responsibilities and all the freedom of choice you have. It will hit you on the head by letting you ask yourself: ""What if I am wrong about everything?"" Last but not least, It will grab you by the arm to know that failure, pain and rejection are part of the process by getting to know the Do Something principle.
This book is about everything in your life. It isn't limited to career topics or relationship styling. But rather to a higher and more intellectual state of mind and reason. This book is for you!This book is not rocket science, it doesn't inform us of new matters that were unknown to us. Rather it tells you exactly what you already know, what is standing right in front of your nose, down in simple, friendly, invasive words that will leave you seeing things much more different than before.I have made it across a lot of various books, but this book is surely different. I believe this book was the hit on the head that I urgely needed to wake up and sort things out differently and to view all my priorities and values with an entirely conscious mind. And to put all my life, past and future, into question!This book will drive you to get hurt facing the inevitable truth, will make you show up your deepest wounds, will leave you in anger, rage and tears depending on what you have encountered in life and the VALUES you are living by.P.S. If you are rigid follower of my reviews you will understand why I underlined the word VALUES and why this book is a so life changing experience to me. As I hope it would be to you too."

I think it's an attempt to piggyback on the success of Marie Kondo's book by being ""inspired"" by the title and hoping people will pay money without looking too hard at the contents of the book."
143,0062457713,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67160575-sara,5,"I am amazed by this book and everything that was in it! Mark Manson really speaks the truth and talks about important issues that are part of our lives. But it takes time, effort and great amount of work on yourself to get to that state of mind he's talking about. We easily fall into routine and complain about it, but not everyone is willing to break the cycle. I think I need to read this book every year.„Don’t just sit there. Do something.

Finally the author tried to make a case that those involved in grief had a choice on how to deal with it citing a parent dealing with child loss and totally lost me At no point in your rambling, incoherent response were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought. Everyone in this room is now dumber for having listened to it. I award you no points Mr Manson, and may God have mercy on your soul."
145,0062457713,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31777090-sohaib,4,"This book is about setting and honing personal values. It's about determining what to give a fuck about in your life. In Manson's witty words, managing the amount of fucks you give. Minimizing the scope of your interests really—to the essentials. Putting all of your eggs in that one basket. Figuring out what that basket is in the first place. Does that make sense?I enjoyed a couple of ideas. One of them is on the importance of cultivating doubt. Manson claims that uncertainty is the way forward and that the key to personal growth lies in being comfortable with it. The comfort breeds an openness that obliterates sticking to rigid values and motivates us towards positive change. Uncertainty breaks the entitlement chain, the belief that you're a special snowflake who deserves special treatment from the world—the naivety of expecting something for nothing, to be loved for doing nothing, to be appreciated for doing nothing, and so on. To break the hold of the spell of certainty and entitlement, Mr. Manson proposes asking yourself three golden questions:1- What if I'm wrong? 2- What would it mean if I'm wrong? 3- Would me being wrong create better problems? I tried them for size and trust me, the sheer entertaining of the possibility of being wrong is refreshing. Also wonderful in cultivating compassion, humility, and acceptance of oneself and others. The success formula Manson proposes goes something like this:Happiness comes from solving problems, and the quality of your problems is determined by the quality of your values and metrics, the standards by which you measure your success. Naturally, the better the problems, the more successful you are. Good problems come from having good values and metrics. And so Manson dedicates more than half of his book to what he sees as the five most important values, and he summarizes them on page 89 in one paragraph:""The first ... is a radical form of responsibility: taking responsibility for everything that occurs in your life, regardless of who's at fault. The second is uncertainty: the acknowledgment of your own ignorance and the cultivation of constant doubt in your own beliefs. The next is failure ... The fourth is rejection: the ability to both say and hear no ... The final value is the contemplation of one's own mortality.""Another idea that stuck is the Do Something Principle, the idea that action can and sometimes should precede motivation. This reminded me of Ralph Waldo Emerson's famous quote: ""Do the thing and you shall have the power."" Most of us, unfortunately, spend our entire lives waiting for that power to come down, waiting for the muse instead of moving in the direction of our dreams. Action > Inspiration > Motivation > Action... (Loop) In the end, The Subtle Art is a sobering unconventional take on self-help, and I recommend it for people looking for just that. Three stars and a half, with a grain of salt. My rating came down from four and a half thanks to me cultivating doubt about this book. So here goes that Mr. Manson."

""Everything worthwhile in life is won through surmounting the associated negative experience. Any attempt to escape the negative, to avoid it or quash it or silence it, only backfires. The avoidance of suffering is a form of suffering. The avoidance of struggle is a struggle. The denial of failure is a failure. Hiding what is shameful is itself a form of shame.Pain is an inextricable thread in the fabric of life, and to tear it out is not only impossible, but destructive: attempting to tear it out unravels everything else with it. To try to avoid pain is to give too many fucks about pain. In contrast, if you’re able to not give a fuck about the pain, you become unstoppable.""
I can't explain how much i love this book. It was even more fun listening to it than reading it. Plus, it's a very short listen; about 6 hours if I remember correctly. It starts off pretty light-hearted and funny with some good points. Then it gets pretty heavy by the end. The last 2 chapter were probably my favorite. It's not a book about giving no fucks at all, only psychopaths and liars don't care about anything, but more so about figuring out what is worthy of the fucks you'll give. Whether you think you give too many fucks or aren't sure what to give a fuck about, read this book. At the very least it's worth using one of your audible credits on. "
147,0062457713,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6168938-zoe,3,Nothing illuminating in this book but it is VERY funny. What the writer wrote about is something we know but often forget. So it was a good reminder for us to focus on the important things. 
148,0062457713,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18989854-krystal,4,"First up, the title is clearly more for shock factor than an accurate title for this book since f*cks are still given, albeit selectively.Second, if bad language, crass stories and vulgar honesty offend you, this may not be an appropriate choice of reading material.Thirdly, these are not particularly new concepts. For alternative reads without the swearing and vulgarity, I'd recommend Daring Greatly: How the Courage to Be Vulnerable Transforms the Way We Live, Love, Parent, and Lead (my 5 star review here) and/or The Courage to be Disliked (my 4 star review here) I'm not a huge fan of swearing etc. myself but this was more about bluntness and simplicity rather than swearing for the sake of it so I didn't mind it quite so much. It's just honest and raw and is quite serious about making its point that no one and nothing is perfect.The point of this book is not to stop 'giving a f*ck', but to choose wisely the things you decide to care about. It raises the fairly common notion that true happiness is beyond the material, and caring about things you can't change (such as others' feelings) will do more harm than good. These ideas are something I definitely connect with, and I do think it's important to take responsibility for your own happiness. Yes, sometimes sh*tty things happen, but you have to find a way through the sh*t to ultimately become stronger, otherwise you're giving up happiness in favour of being a victim.The delivery is certainly not for everyone as there's no sympathy here, and the apathetic will be disappointed because instead of finding a common ideal this book hits with some hard truths. People who are offended easily will find plenty to be offended about, and it's easy to criticise the author for his sexist examples and analogies and the despicable behaviour of his past (which we only know because he has chosen to share). It starts with the message, 'don't try' and concludes with '...and then you die' and in between is a whole lot of 'you are not special', which honestly all sounds quite depressing but it really does make a lot of sense. It tells us we are not special, but then goes on to suggest why that might be so painful to hear. If you are open-minded, you'll understand and perhaps appreciate the wisdom in it; if you're more stubborn you'll close your eyes, cover your ears and repeat to yourself that you are special, no matter what this crappy little book says (thus increasing the pressure on yourself to be special). All in all, the book makes a lot of sense, but you have to be open and accepting enough to appreciate it.Side note: I was really surprised there were no references listed, considering how many names were dropped and psychology experiments referenced etc. Curious.If this rubbed you up the wrong way I'd definitely suggest giving Daring Greatly a chance, as it's a much more comprehensive (and kind) exploration of the same themes.This was book 24 in my #Dymocks52challenge refined.

The book is a reaction to the self-help industry and what Manson saw as a culture of mindless positivity that isn't practical or helpful for most people. Manson uses many of his own personal experiences to illustrate how life's struggles often give it more meaning, which, he argues, is a better approach than constantly trying to be happy. Manson's approach and writing style have been categorized by some as contrarian to the general self-help industry, using blunt honesty and profanity to illustrate his ideas.The book has 9 chapters with the following titles:1. Don't Try.2. Happiness is a problem.3. You are not special.4. The value of suffering.5. You are always choosing.6. You are wrong about everything (But so am I).7. Failure is the way forward.8.

So I agree that action can bring about inspiration which can lead to motivation. "

This book offers a is a zero-nonsense approach to self-help concepts. I’ve heard most of it before but the author delivers the message in a concise, sorry-if-it-hurts, straight-forward way.I found some of the advice helpful and I’m glad I read it. I understand now why it might resonate with many people and recommend it to those always seeking to improve themselves."

Instead I got a collection of banal insights, wrapped in supposedly funny dirty-talk. References to philosophy/literature were reminiscent of an author who just skimmed through ""100 ideas in X you need to know"" and didn't bother further. They were forced and off-beat especially considering the overall tone, which itself fluctuated between the earnestness of self-help drivel and the tongue-in-cheek of comedy memoirs. Ironically, this was the only convincing argument made to support the point on making choices to narrow down your options. Looks like the author didn’t even follow his own advice."

But I've seen this one floating around and it's been getting some great reviews so I got curious and decided to check this one out. I listened to the audiobook and was able to get through it in a few days. Now I know why I don't read self help books. I don't know why but it comes across as so pretentious to me, and hearing Mark Manson ramble on for so long about ""not giving a fuck"" and ""only giving a fuck about the things that matter"" it just felt to me like he was trying too hard. Also, he's a privileged white man and some of this felt very douche-y to me. Like him talking about how he tells his wife when she doesn't look good because honesty is more important... like okay. I just didn't enjoy this the way I thought I might. I don't think self help books are for me. "

Book has no originality and better writers have written more brilliantly about these topics. Entire thing boils down to irritating, naive, amateur psychology from a douchebag in serious ignorance of his douchebaggery. The book suffers from the problem of extremes. In this case, in attempting to correct for admittedly nauseating over positivity bullshit, the author is now guilty of the same crap in the opposite direction - an over glorification of suffering. This is just as much of a crap fest as what he claims to be avoiding. Laughable part is that dude is an entitled little shithead who's got no understanding of suffering. There's even more considerable lack of understanding of medical/scientific research and on some level he seems to believe that people with real psychological issues should just get over themselves cause everyone has problems. When a human being gets to a point where he can equate his self imposed drugged infused decade of ""trauma"" stemming from his parents divorce to the real trauma of a father losing his son, that's serious entitled bullshit! To conclude that someone who has suffered through hellish circumstances can just move on based on cherry picked examples of celebrities making it, is pathetically superficial. This kind of crappy thinking is what results in selfish individuals who can only empathize with others if they have gone through similar experiences themselves. Books like this don't move the dial in improving humanity, they just create/justify narcissistic characters who hide their narcissism behind a wall of false self improvement. This author is no different from the cultish positivity people he scorns. He spews the same sanctimonious, bullshit rhetoric where he pats himself on the back by stating how his values help make the world better! His whole unoriginal theory of put on your big boy panties and get over yourself mentality is just as terrible as the whole disappear into some zen bullshit crapfest. It's this kind of mentality that makes people say if I could make it, I don't get why anyone else can't either. It fails to recognize differences in circumstances. I'm all for suck it up and deal with life but the ability to fail to recognize that maybe the dad with the dead kid has suffered more pain than the asshole with the cheating ex girlfriend is ludicrous! What this guy has done is surround himself with folks so obviously dysfunctional, he ends up looking like the king in a world of spectacular ignorance. The question that should be asked as he gives multiple examples of his idiotic friends being assholes, is how has he managed to collect so many terrible people in his circle? What does this say about his values and judgement? In the end, author is no different from his douchebag ""friend"" he described in the earlier chapters except unlike the friend who limited himself to sponging off of relatives, this dude has expanded his narcissistic reach to a wider audience. Still playing the victim of the trauma of his parents divorce, still standing for nothing except the right to say what he wants, when he wants to whoever he wants. There's a word for people like that - douchebag! "
157,0062457713,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16131467-nate-icart,1,"I absolutely hated this book. Reasons why:-The author's jokes were terrible. His style of humor is just to add a random number to an example (""I felt like I was punched 253 times in the stomach""). -Many (most) of the concepts in this book are ripped from common bodies of knowledge (he explains the basic economic concept of opportunity cost like he was the one who discovered it)-His experiences all feel fake. He talks about how came to deep realizations about his life when we was a fresh college graduate -- not that this is impossible, just very unlikely.-The first few chapters have the word ""Fuck"" in them so much that it just feels like he's making excuses to say it. I like swearing, but every time he talks about sex he calls it ""fucking"". No one talks like that.-It's very hard to take a 32 year old self-help guru seriously when they don't have a real life like the rest of us. He's been a world-traveler and an extremely popular blogger for years. He explained that he only held a ""real"" job for 6 weeks post-graduation. Who can relate to this?-The best part about this book is the cover. Manson is good at marketing, and he's good in short-form (like on his blog), but I will never read another book that he writes."
158,0062457713,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30279227-ts-chan,3,"3.5 stars.I don't usually reach for self-help books. However, the title of this book piqued my curiosity and it perpetually appears on the main page of Audible as a best seller, thus furthering my interest to pick it up. As an audiobook, I did enjoy this quite a fair bit as the narrator was good and brought life to the narrative. Admittedly, the advice contained herein was not ground-breaking, but delivered in a refreshing and humourous manner. It served as a reminder as to what we probably already know in the deep, dark recesses of our minds, but are too caught up in the hectic modern life and excesses for greater inner reflection. I find a few of the real-life examples quoted to be quite relevant and effective.

Who you are is defined by what you're willing to struggle for.

The title is slightly misleading as the book is not so much as to how not to give a f*ck but to choose what is important enough to give a f*ck about. It is about getting our priorities and values right so that we pick the right battles which truly matter in making our lives count for something. If we start giving a f*ck about every little thing, we will end up spending too much energy on trivial matters and being generally uncontented about life. While it is fine not to feel positive all the time, learning how to channel that in the right direction and taking charge of your life where it is possible to make a difference are the essential messages the book is getting across to the reader. The one theme that was discussed which I feel very strongly about was concerning the 'sense of entitlement' and how this can be destructive in the way one views his or her life. And social media is probably the biggest culprit in propagating this negative view to a whole new level. Being constantly bombarded with reality shows, Instagrams and blogs of beautiful people enjoying a beautiful life, we start to ask ""Why can't I be like so-and-so?"" or ""Why can't I have this or that too?"". As a 14-year old niece of mine rightly pointed out, Instagram represents filtered existence. It seems almost natural now for most to block out the unfavourable or darker segments of life or humanity - such as poverty, hunger, war, violence, human trafficking, prostitution, etc. Instead, we moan and groan about the 'unfortunate circumstances' of not being able to own nice cars and big houses, have great clothes and the requisite body to go with it, go on expensive holidays, or obtain that 'much-deserved' promotion at work - the list goes on and on.Anyway, I'm rambling - this is a topic that I can go on and on about, but that's not the point about this review. If you're curious, this is worth a read as it is quite funny and does not take up much time to finish. Even though much of what is said was nothing new, sometimes we just need that extra nudge.This review can also be found at Booknest"
159,0062457713,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5759543-sam-quixote,3,"Eye-catching title, eh? Unfortunately that’s about all that really stands out about Mark Manson’s The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck, which is actually a very ordinary self-help book - and I’ve not even read a lot of self-help books either, that’s how broad, generic and unremarkable a lot of the stuff he talks about here is! Still, its ideas are ultimately positive and worth re-reading and keeping in mind so I can’t say I found the book a total waste of time. The book’s title and main thesis can be summed up as: finding and caring about the shit that matters to you while ignoring the shit that doesn’t - see what I mean when I say it’s unremarkable? But wait, there’s more! Manson has more vapid platitudes like how life’s about the journey, not the destination, how finding meaning in life is better than accumulating material possessions, and that, seeing as we’re all going to die one day, why waste our limited time on shit that doesn’t matter? Not that I disagree with any of that but there’s nothing new or special about that information and you definitely don’t need to read this book to hear that kind of stuff. In fact, you don’t even need to read it anywhere at all as these ideas are so ubiquitous in pop culture as to be cliched! But, like I said, the book also contains useful messages that are worth hearing whether or not you’ve come across them before. Messages like pain and struggle are necessary and unavoidable parts of life. That rising up to challenges and facing hard truths about ourselves help us grow as well as make us stronger at weathering the shit life inevitably throws our way. That failure - so long as we learn from it - eventually leads to success so we shouldn’t be afraid to keep trying even if we’ll probably fail. That dissatisfaction and being uncomfortable are good as they motivate us to change and improve ourselves and our circumstances. I agree that perspective and values are important and that adjusting these can lead to a more satisfying existence. This means accepting that you’ll probably never be rich and famous, that you’re probably not an undiscovered genius or great artist, or that anything you’ll ever do will have any lasting impact on future generations. And that realisation can be freeing to pursue the things that only matter to you.As Manson notes, nothing is certain, which is a profoundly obvious yet difficult lesson I’m slowly learning and re-learning all the time. We also have a tendency to create our own narratives that are confining and are worth exploding as they’re largely bullshit. And I totally agree with and can personally attest that taking more responsibility in your life leads to far greater happiness. Jocko Willink has a similar philosophy: Discipline Equals Freedom. But I don’t buy Manson’s anecdote that when he googled the quote “With great power comes great responsibility” he couldn’t find out who originally said it. As a comics reader, I instantly know it was Spider-Man’s Uncle Ben but I can’t believe a Google search wouldn’t tell him that! He’s right though when he says that excessive freedoms don’t lead to happiness. You only need to look at the toxic Social Justice movement currently poisoning Western politics whose adherents are obsessed with personal freedoms - none of those people are ever happy! His points on the importance of boundaries in relationships and healthy conflict stemming from honesty though were banal and unnecessary. I’m a terrible procrastinator so I really liked the “Do Something” principle where you just do whatever it is you should be doing rather than waiting for the “right moment” or inspiration to strike. The idea is that once you start doing something, especially badly, you’ll eventually start doing it right. Action leads to motivation leads to inspiration leads to success - basically a practical application of not being afraid of failure and one I’ll be trying out myself. I wasn’t that interested in Manson’s autobiographical anecdotes, which were mostly mundane, nor did I find a lot of the examples he chose to illustrate his ideas to be that compelling, though I do like the possibility that Shakespeare wrote Romeo & Juliet as a satire on love especially as so many view it as the ultimate romance story! I also don’t agree that caring less about something means you’ll do better at it or that great people become great because they don’t think they’re great which is why they work harder than most. Both are, like a lot of the statements he makes, an oversimplified generalisation. Maybe he’s right for some but maybe some others already think they’re great and are driven by something else? And, like all self-help books, it needs to be vague enough to be a one-size fits all for the widest possible appeal so I’m not sure how helpful it’s going to be in finding its audience’s meaning in their individual lives - it certainly didn’t mine! But on the whole Manson is a decent writer who’s able to put his ideas across quite clearly in an accessible way. The messaging may be fairly commonplace and underwhelming but I found enough good stuff here to have gotten something out of reading it and if you’ve read no self-help books at all you might find this even more useful! The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck is kinda worth giving a fuck about, just don’t expect much from it. "

Her lip curls at the sight of ""shit"" and her eyebrows furrow at every ""fuck"" thrown by Mark Manson.Condescending Customer: ""Is there a version of this book without cursing? I feel that it is unnecessary...""Jen's jaw drops: That would defeat the purpose of -Awesome colleague grabs an empty journal: Here we go.

161,0062457713,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3643764-esil,4,"3.5 starsI’m not sure what possessed me to listen to this audiobook. I have ZERO interest in self help books. But once I started, I thought it was good enough to keep going.The title is there for shock value, but it’s not a particularly shocking book, unless you’re easily put off by swearing. The author is not really advocating that we all drop everything and run to the beach. He’s arguing for recalibrating what matters to you, and acting on it.The secondary title - “a counterintuitive approach to living a good life” - is deceptive. There’s nothing counterintuitive here. There’s a lot of common sense. But it’s pretty good common sense. And also timely in many ways. So I didn’t have any aha moments, but I nodded my head a fair bit.The question that kept buzzing at the back of my mind is how likely people are to be able to make dramatic changes in their lives by being told to shift the focus on what matters to them. In other words, easier said than done. But still worth thinking about every now and then.I think I’ll stick to my ZERO self help books policy, but this wasn’t a bad foray out of my usual comfort zones."
162,0062457713,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22371819-mariah-roze,4,This was a great book! I've been seeing it everywhere so I wanted to read it. This book was great at reminding you that you shouldn't care what other people think. It is important to do what you want and what your heart wants. It also reminds you that you don't need to be famous or have a spectacular life to have a great life. This is YOUR life. Do what YOU want!
163,0062457713,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45341691-israt-zaman-disha,4,"""The desire for more positive experience is itself a negative experience. And, paradoxically, the acceptance of one’s negative experience is itself a positive experience.""I never thought of reading this book. Saw a hype about it recently in a group on facebook. So I just wanted to know what this book is about. After reading the blurb on goodreads, I thought to give it a go, see what's the hype about. So I started listening to the audiobook. ""Not giving a fuck does not mean being indifferent; it means being comfortable with being different.""First thing I learned from this book is, never judge a book by its cover or title or first chapter. In the first chapter, the author said f*ck like a 100 times. I think there was no need to said that word this many times. I don't have any problem with saying fuck. But when I read/listen to fuck this many times in just one chapter, I cannot help but feel irritated. So yeah, I was irritated but decided to go on. And I am glad of my decision. ""Maturity is what happens when one learns to only give a fuck about what’s truly fuckworthy.""I don't think this book is an inspiring one. The writer didn't want to tell people how to be motivated or how to be a successful person. He simply told how to be happy in life. What is the mantra behind peace and happiness in one's life. And I have to say I totally agree. And that mantra is not giving a fuck. Well, now some may think that not giving a fuck means being indifferent to everything. But that's not true. There's a very thin line between being indifferent and being indifferent to the things that are not important in life. Mark Manson talked about this difference and how we care about everything. In this book, he shared many of his thoughts about happiness, emotion, sufferings, values, responsibilities, rejections, and relations of our life. And I agree with most of the things he said. You can say I am bragging but I found that my thoughts and ideas about life are a lot like Mark Manson. And yes I was lame and pathetic once. But I am growing. I am learning the subtle art of not giving a fuck. ""Being wrong opens us up to the possibility of change. Being wrong brings the opportunity for growth.""One thing I love while reading something is when I find some character I can relate to real life. And this book was full of it. Sometimes I find someone who is exactly like my friend, then someone pretty much like my boss and finally someone a lot like me. It was a major point why I liked this book. ""There is a simple realization from which all personal improvement and growth emerge. This is the realization that we, individually, are responsible for everything in our lives, no matter the external circumstances. We don’t always control what happens to us. But we always control how we interpret what happens to us, as well as how we respond. Whether we consciously recognize it or not, we are always responsible for our experiences.""There's one thing that I didn't understand the last chapter. And I was thinking of giving a star less for it. Then I thought maybe I haven't grown that much yet. So yeah I will reread the last chapter after two or three years and see if it makes any sense. So 5 stars for now... :D ""To be happy we need something to solve. Happiness is, therefore, a form of action..."""

The things mentioned in the book are logical and make immense sense, they're also presented with interesting and sometimes personal issues to get the idea. Manson's writing is straight to the point and natural; it flows like a conversation rather than a self-help rant. All this, and I still couldn't find much enthusiasm for the things being said because I find them to be basic things that I've always believed. It did give me a few things to consider and maybe look up, but I don't get why people keep telling me that it's ""life changing."""

It’s less about not giving a fuck and more about what is worth giving a fuck about. And there are things that are worth giving a fuck about! In fact, Manson tells us that having problems is a good thing… only it’s important that we fill our lives mostly with problems that we want to have. Sound confusing? Read the book. He’ll also hit it home that life isn’t fair or easy, and it’s not supposed to be.

I even highlighted tons of favorite quotes from this book, whenever I feel anxious, stressed, or depressed I read those quote and trust me it really ease my mind.“Who you are is defined by what you’re willing to struggle for.” The funny thing is I had no expectation from this book, I just decided to read it because I've seen many people were talking about this book. I am not much into self-help books. When I started to read this book, I knew immediately I would love it. This book doesn't sugarcoat anything. It's blunt, true, and makes you realize not to waste your emotional energy. You should know when and where you should give a fuck and when or where you shouldn't. It will make life a lot different, in a positive way. I would definitely recommend this book."

They're usually written by preachy, entitled people who believe they've ""made it"" telling you what to do and how to think, as if you're a brainless amoeba lapping up their greatness. This book is no different. Filled mainly with questionable anecdotes and retellings of things we already know, I kept on reading for some actual substance. It starts off well enough, but descends into a baseless think piece from the perspective of an entitled white male.

BUT Mark Manson had a wonderful approach to his book. He is just a normal person without all that Botox and designer jeans that made his butt look bigger telling me he has many things HE has to work on a daily basis and what he had to overcome to not be a piece of shit psycho. I had to return the book to its rightful owner so I can't pick out my favorite quotes (and I'm not buying it for $30) but this book is very quotable and very raw.I have always known I am a people pleaser and I really hate that trait about me because I put myself in awkward positions and then resent the person I want to help because 1. They weren't grateful enough 2. They will never ever return the favor 3. They turned out to be shitty people. 4. I am just annoyed!So yes, it okay to say NO to people. I don't have to care about every little cause and I should definitely have my priorities straight. Stop being fake and surround yourself with people that are meaningful to you. Just do and see what happens from there. You are not unique and your problems are not unique so once you realize this you can just live your life without that carrot dangling over your sleep. With failure you learn about who you are and can grow as a person. Just because you failed at something doesn't mean you are a failure. Social media life is fake so you are not pathetic for not eating at Spago for lunch or being in the Caribbean this year. Be true to the person you want to be. There was more to it and Manson had some great stories in there. My Negatives- He said ""Fuck"" wwwaaayyy too much. I get it. That's the damn title of the book.Sometimes got repetitive.Overall- recommend."

I wouldn’t normally reach for a self help book, but Mark Moran’s The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck: A Counterintuitive Approach to Living a Good Life, was the pick for our book club this month. It also formed part of challenge read on 'read a self help guide' I have going with a fellow bookworm. I decided to give this book a chance and I went into reading it with an open mind, despite my reservations about the bold title. I surprised myself by enjoying this book. I found it a highly readable, direct, humorous and relatable guide. I wouldn’t say this is a self help book as such, but more a strategy in self evaluation. Many of the ideas and approaches Moran suggests we should take to change our lives are simple to implement and most probably have in the back of our minds – yet Moran suggest what we lack is courage to act on this. What Moran does is put these ideas in spotlight and his book works to give the reader the encouragement needed to put his notions into practice. What I appreciated the most about The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck was insertion of real life stories within this text. Moran linked his approaches to concrete scenarios, which gave his guide much more brevity. From the author Moran’s own back story from hitting rock bottom to becoming a blogger extraordinaire, to celebrity examples such as former Beatles drummer Pete Best and even World War II survivours - the message is clear in all cases. What almost breaks you may in fact make you a stronger, happier and better person. "

I am one of those whom are fed up with all those toxic self-development books. That type of books like: How to achieve greatness, How to win and influence people, how to be rich, etc, etc. This book is completely as it states the ""Counterintuitive approach to Living a Good Life"", the, as I'd love to put it, ""Anti-Self development book of really good life"". So whatever reader are you, this book is for you!""The Subtle Art of Not Giving A F*ck""The moment you read the title you think: ""Really! Could this even be a title?!""A title that will either scare you out to give it a try, or will burn your eagerness to know what it is all about. To be honest, I am freaked out to write a review about this book. I finished the book a day earlier but had no guts to start on writing a review. But as I recently feel obliged to write a review about every single book that I read, thus it seemed inevitable to write it sooner or later. So here we go. Fasten your seat belt!If you have ever heard of Charles Bukowski, Buddha, Hiroo Onoda, Norio Suzuki, Dave Mustaine, Pete Best, William James, Malala Yousafzai, Meredith Maran, Pablo Picasso, Romeo & Juliet, Ernest Becker, then trust me, you will learn their stories again in a very different way that will seize your mind and leave you completely astonished.This book will help you know why all the other self-development books didn't help you or anyone else through the principle of the Feedback Loop from Hell.It will tell you why we are always searching for the happiness and what should the true happiness be from everyone's own perspective.Moreover it will accuse you, and me, of overrating certain life aspects. You will also get to meet the Disappointment Panda and figure out how would you deal with him.You will learn by yourself how everyone is given to choose their own struggles.You will know that it is not a must to me the superhero and the very special person in that exaggerating behavior, in a matter of fact, thus everyone should be one! Nevertheless not lowering or diminishing the value of being one!It will tear you apart while knowing the value of suffering, the shitty values and great values through The Self-Awarness Onion.Furthermore, it will condemn you of your responsibilities and all the freedom of choice you have.

Last but not least, It will grab you by the arm to know that failure, pain and rejection are part of the process by getting to know the Do Something principle.
This book is about everything in your life. It isn't limited to career topics or relationship styling. But rather to a higher and more intellectual state of mind and reason. This book is for you!This book is not rocket science, it doesn't inform us of new matters that were unknown to us. Rather it tells you exactly what you already know, what is standing right in front of your nose, down in simple, friendly, invasive words that will leave you seeing things much more different than before.I have made it across a lot of various books, but this book is surely different. I believe this book was the hit on the head that I urgely needed to wake up and sort things out differently and to view all my priorities and values with an entirely conscious mind. And to put all my life, past and future, into question!This book will drive you to get hurt facing the inevitable truth, will make you show up your deepest wounds, will leave you in anger, rage and tears depending on what you have encountered in life and the VALUES you are living by.P.S.

I think it's an attempt to piggyback on the success of Marie Kondo's book by being ""inspired"" by the title and hoping people will pay money without looking too hard at the contents of the book."

Mark Manson really speaks the truth and talks about important issues that are part of our lives.

Everyone in this room is now dumber for having listened to it. I award you no points Mr Manson, and may God have mercy on your soul."
175,0062457713,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31777090-sohaib,4,"This book is about setting and honing personal values. It's about determining what to give a fuck about in your life. In Manson's witty words, managing the amount of fucks you give. Minimizing the scope of your interests really—to the essentials. Putting all of your eggs in that one basket. Figuring out what that basket is in the first place. Does that make sense?I enjoyed a couple of ideas. One of them is on the importance of cultivating doubt. Manson claims that uncertainty is the way forward and that the key to personal growth lies in being comfortable with it. The comfort breeds an openness that obliterates sticking to rigid values and motivates us towards positive change. Uncertainty breaks the entitlement chain, the belief that you're a special snowflake who deserves special treatment from the world—the naivety of expecting something for nothing, to be loved for doing nothing, to be appreciated for doing nothing, and so on. To break the hold of the spell of certainty and entitlement, Mr. Manson proposes asking yourself three golden questions:1- What if I'm wrong? 2- What would it mean if I'm wrong? 3- Would me being wrong create better problems? I tried them for size and trust me, the sheer entertaining of the possibility of being wrong is refreshing. Also wonderful in cultivating compassion, humility, and acceptance of oneself and others. The success formula Manson proposes goes something like this:Happiness comes from solving problems, and the quality of your problems is determined by the quality of your values and metrics, the standards by which you measure your success. Naturally, the better the problems, the more successful you are. Good problems come from having good values and metrics. And so Manson dedicates more than half of his book to what he sees as the five most important values, and he summarizes them on page 89 in one paragraph:""The first ... is a radical form of responsibility: taking responsibility for everything that occurs in your life, regardless of who's at fault. The second is uncertainty: the acknowledgment of your own ignorance and the cultivation of constant doubt in your own beliefs. The next is failure ... The fourth is rejection: the ability to both say and hear no ... The final value is the contemplation of one's own mortality.""Another idea that stuck is the Do Something Principle, the idea that action can and sometimes should precede motivation. This reminded me of Ralph Waldo Emerson's famous quote: ""Do the thing and you shall have the power."" Most of us, unfortunately, spend our entire lives waiting for that power to come down, waiting for the muse instead of moving in the direction of our dreams. Action > Inspiration > Motivation > Action... (Loop) In the end, The Subtle Art is a sobering unconventional take on self-help, and I recommend it for people looking for just that. Three stars and a half, with a grain of salt. My rating came down from four and a half thanks to me cultivating doubt about this book. So here goes that Mr. Manson."

""Everything worthwhile in life is won through surmounting the associated negative experience. Any attempt to escape the negative, to avoid it or quash it or silence it, only backfires. The avoidance of suffering is a form of suffering. The avoidance of struggle is a struggle. The denial of failure is a failure. Hiding what is shameful is itself a form of shame.Pain is an inextricable thread in the fabric of life, and to tear it out is not only impossible, but destructive: attempting to tear it out unravels everything else with it. To try to avoid pain is to give too many fucks about pain. In contrast, if you’re able to not give a fuck about the pain, you become unstoppable.""
I can't explain how much i love this book. It was even more fun listening to it than reading it. Plus, it's a very short listen; about 6 hours if I remember correctly. It starts off pretty light-hearted and funny with some good points. Then it gets pretty heavy by the end. The last 2 chapter were probably my favorite. It's not a book about giving no fucks at all, only psychopaths and liars don't care about anything, but more so about figuring out what is worthy of the fucks you'll give. Whether you think you give too many fucks or aren't sure what to give a fuck about, read this book. At the very least it's worth using one of your audible credits on. "
177,0062457713,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6168938-zoe,3,Nothing illuminating in this book but it is VERY funny. What the writer wrote about is something we know but often forget. So it was a good reminder for us to focus on the important things. 
178,0062457713,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18989854-krystal,4,"First up, the title is clearly more for shock factor than an accurate title for this book since f*cks are still given, albeit selectively.Second, if bad language, crass stories and vulgar honesty offend you, this may not be an appropriate choice of reading material.Thirdly, these are not particularly new concepts. For alternative reads without the swearing and vulgarity, I'd recommend Daring Greatly: How the Courage to Be Vulnerable Transforms the Way We Live, Love, Parent, and Lead (my 5 star review here) and/or The Courage to be Disliked (my 4 star review here) I'm not a huge fan of swearing etc. myself but this was more about bluntness and simplicity rather than swearing for the sake of it so I didn't mind it quite so much. It's just honest and raw and is quite serious about making its point that no one and nothing is perfect.The point of this book is not to stop 'giving a f*ck', but to choose wisely the things you decide to care about. It raises the fairly common notion that true happiness is beyond the material, and caring about things you can't change (such as others' feelings) will do more harm than good. These ideas are something I definitely connect with, and I do think it's important to take responsibility for your own happiness. Yes, sometimes sh*tty things happen, but you have to find a way through the sh*t to ultimately become stronger, otherwise you're giving up happiness in favour of being a victim.The delivery is certainly not for everyone as there's no sympathy here, and the apathetic will be disappointed because instead of finding a common ideal this book hits with some hard truths. People who are offended easily will find plenty to be offended about, and it's easy to criticise the author for his sexist examples and analogies and the despicable behaviour of his past (which we only know because he has chosen to share). It starts with the message, 'don't try' and concludes with '...and then you die' and in between is a whole lot of 'you are not special', which honestly all sounds quite depressing but it really does make a lot of sense. It tells us we are not special, but then goes on to suggest why that might be so painful to hear. If you are open-minded, you'll understand and perhaps appreciate the wisdom in it; if you're more stubborn you'll close your eyes, cover your ears and repeat to yourself that you are special, no matter what this crappy little book says (thus increasing the pressure on yourself to be special). All in all, the book makes a lot of sense, but you have to be open and accepting enough to appreciate it.Side note: I was really surprised there were no references listed, considering how many names were dropped and psychology experiments referenced etc. Curious.If this rubbed you up the wrong way I'd definitely suggest giving Daring Greatly a chance, as it's a much more comprehensive (and kind) exploration of the same themes.This was book 24 in my #Dymocks52challenge refined.

The book is a reaction to the self-help industry and what Manson saw as a culture of mindless positivity that isn't practical or helpful for most people. Manson uses many of his own personal experiences to illustrate how life's struggles often give it more meaning, which, he argues, is a better approach than constantly trying to be happy. Manson's approach and writing style have been categorized by some as contrarian to the general self-help industry, using blunt honesty and profanity to illustrate his ideas.The book has 9 chapters with the following titles:1.

I was totally into reading it and it seemed great at first, but truthfully, for me, the best chapters were the last two.

Surprisingly, oftentimes, I ended up getting ''into'' whatever action I was performing that I initially wanted to avoid. So I agree that action can bring about inspiration which can lead to motivation. "

I like to browse this list because it shows you what people are actually reading instead of just what people are buying.I find the list more useful than other bestsellers’ list because it tells me which books are engaging people, after all, we’ve all picked up a title and abandoned it after a few pages because it wasn’t interesting or compelling.So, I went ahead and borrowed it from the library. This book offers a is a zero-nonsense approach to self-help concepts. I’ve heard most of it before but the author delivers the message in a concise, sorry-if-it-hurts, straight-forward way.I found some of the advice helpful and I’m glad I read it. I understand now why it might resonate with many people and recommend it to those always seeking to improve themselves."
184,0062457713,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20214132-crankmuffin,2,"I was expecting an enjoyable read on not taking things too seriously. Instead I got a collection of banal insights, wrapped in supposedly funny dirty-talk. References to philosophy/literature were reminiscent of an author who just skimmed through ""100 ideas in X you need to know"" and didn't bother further. They were forced and off-beat especially considering the overall tone, which itself fluctuated between the earnestness of self-help drivel and the tongue-in-cheek of comedy memoirs. Ironically, this was the only convincing argument made to support the point on making choices to narrow down your options. Looks like the author didn’t even follow his own advice."
185,0062457713,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26560207-gabby,2,"I don't read a lot of self help books. In fact, I don't think I've ever read one before this. But I've seen this one floating around and it's been getting some great reviews so I got curious and decided to check this one out. I listened to the audiobook and was able to get through it in a few days. Now I know why I don't read self help books. I don't know why but it comes across as so pretentious to me, and hearing Mark Manson ramble on for so long about ""not giving a fuck"" and ""only giving a fuck about the things that matter"" it just felt to me like he was trying too hard. Also, he's a privileged white man and some of this felt very douche-y to me. Like him talking about how he tells his wife when she doesn't look good because honesty is more important... like okay. I just didn't enjoy this the way I thought I might. I don't think self help books are for me. "
186,0062457713,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5632120-zaphoddent,1,"Catchy title but fails to deliver on anything concrete. Book has no originality and better writers have written more brilliantly about these topics. Entire thing boils down to irritating, naive, amateur psychology from a douchebag in serious ignorance of his douchebaggery. The book suffers from the problem of extremes. In this case, in attempting to correct for admittedly nauseating over positivity bullshit, the author is now guilty of the same crap in the opposite direction - an over glorification of suffering. This is just as much of a crap fest as what he claims to be avoiding. Laughable part is that dude is an entitled little shithead who's got no understanding of suffering. There's even more considerable lack of understanding of medical/scientific research and on some level he seems to believe that people with real psychological issues should just get over themselves cause everyone has problems. When a human being gets to a point where he can equate his self imposed drugged infused decade of ""trauma"" stemming from his parents divorce to the real trauma of a father losing his son, that's serious entitled bullshit! To conclude that someone who has suffered through hellish circumstances can just move on based on cherry picked examples of celebrities making it, is pathetically superficial. This kind of crappy thinking is what results in selfish individuals who can only empathize with others if they have gone through similar experiences themselves. Books like this don't move the dial in improving humanity, they just create/justify narcissistic characters who hide their narcissism behind a wall of false self improvement. This author is no different from the cultish positivity people he scorns. He spews the same sanctimonious, bullshit rhetoric where he pats himself on the back by stating how his values help make the world better! His whole unoriginal theory of put on your big boy panties and get over yourself mentality is just as terrible as the whole disappear into some zen bullshit crapfest. It's this kind of mentality that makes people say if I could make it, I don't get why anyone else can't either. It fails to recognize differences in circumstances. I'm all for suck it up and deal with life but the ability to fail to recognize that maybe the dad with the dead kid has suffered more pain than the asshole with the cheating ex girlfriend is ludicrous! What this guy has done is surround himself with folks so obviously dysfunctional, he ends up looking like the king in a world of spectacular ignorance. The question that should be asked as he gives multiple examples of his idiotic friends being assholes, is how has he managed to collect so many terrible people in his circle? What does this say about his values and judgement? In the end, author is no different from his douchebag ""friend"" he described in the earlier chapters except unlike the friend who limited himself to sponging off of relatives, this dude has expanded his narcissistic reach to a wider audience. Still playing the victim of the trauma of his parents divorce, still standing for nothing except the right to say what he wants, when he wants to whoever he wants. There's a word for people like that - douchebag! "
187,0062457713,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16131467-nate-icart,1,"I absolutely hated this book. Reasons why:-The author's jokes were terrible. His style of humor is just to add a random number to an example (""I felt like I was punched 253 times in the stomach""). -Many (most) of the concepts in this book are ripped from common bodies of knowledge (he explains the basic economic concept of opportunity cost like he was the one who discovered it)-His experiences all feel fake. He talks about how came to deep realizations about his life when we was a fresh college graduate -- not that this is impossible, just very unlikely.-The first few chapters have the word ""Fuck"" in them so much that it just feels like he's making excuses to say it. I like swearing, but every time he talks about sex he calls it ""fucking"". No one talks like that.-It's very hard to take a 32 year old self-help guru seriously when they don't have a real life like the rest of us. He's been a world-traveler and an extremely popular blogger for years. He explained that he only held a ""real"" job for 6 weeks post-graduation. Who can relate to this?-The best part about this book is the cover. Manson is good at marketing, and he's good in short-form (like on his blog), but I will never read another book that he writes."
188,0062457713,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30279227-ts-chan,3,"3.5 stars.I don't usually reach for self-help books. However, the title of this book piqued my curiosity and it perpetually appears on the main page of Audible as a best seller, thus furthering my interest to pick it up. As an audiobook, I did enjoy this quite a fair bit as the narrator was good and brought life to the narrative. Admittedly, the advice contained herein was not ground-breaking, but delivered in a refreshing and humourous manner. It served as a reminder as to what we probably already know in the deep, dark recesses of our minds, but are too caught up in the hectic modern life and excesses for greater inner reflection. I find a few of the real-life examples quoted to be quite relevant and effective.

Who you are is defined by what you're willing to struggle for.

The title is slightly misleading as the book is not so much as to how not to give a f*ck but to choose what is important enough to give a f*ck about. It is about getting our priorities and values right so that we pick the right battles which truly matter in making our lives count for something. If we start giving a f*ck about every little thing, we will end up spending too much energy on trivial matters and being generally uncontented about life. While it is fine not to feel positive all the time, learning how to channel that in the right direction and taking charge of your life where it is possible to make a difference are the essential messages the book is getting across to the reader. The one theme that was discussed which I feel very strongly about was concerning the 'sense of entitlement' and how this can be destructive in the way one views his or her life. And social media is probably the biggest culprit in propagating this negative view to a whole new level. Being constantly bombarded with reality shows, Instagrams and blogs of beautiful people enjoying a beautiful life, we start to ask ""Why can't I be like so-and-so?"" or ""Why can't I have this or that too?"". As a 14-year old niece of mine rightly pointed out, Instagram represents filtered existence. It seems almost natural now for most to block out the unfavourable or darker segments of life or humanity - such as poverty, hunger, war, violence, human trafficking, prostitution, etc. Instead, we moan and groan about the 'unfortunate circumstances' of not being able to own nice cars and big houses, have great clothes and the requisite body to go with it, go on expensive holidays, or obtain that 'much-deserved' promotion at work - the list goes on and on.Anyway, I'm rambling - this is a topic that I can go on and on about, but that's not the point about this review. If you're curious, this is worth a read as it is quite funny and does not take up much time to finish. Even though much of what is said was nothing new, sometimes we just need that extra nudge.This review can also be found at Booknest"
189,0062457713,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5759543-sam-quixote,3,"Eye-catching title, eh? Unfortunately that’s about all that really stands out about Mark Manson’s The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck, which is actually a very ordinary self-help book - and I’ve not even read a lot of self-help books either, that’s how broad, generic and unremarkable a lot of the stuff he talks about here is! Still, its ideas are ultimately positive and worth re-reading and keeping in mind so I can’t say I found the book a total waste of time. The book’s title and main thesis can be summed up as: finding and caring about the shit that matters to you while ignoring the shit that doesn’t - see what I mean when I say it’s unremarkable? But wait, there’s more! Manson has more vapid platitudes like how life’s about the journey, not the destination, how finding meaning in life is better than accumulating material possessions, and that, seeing as we’re all going to die one day, why waste our limited time on shit that doesn’t matter? Not that I disagree with any of that but there’s nothing new or special about that information and you definitely don’t need to read this book to hear that kind of stuff. In fact, you don’t even need to read it anywhere at all as these ideas are so ubiquitous in pop culture as to be cliched! But, like I said, the book also contains useful messages that are worth hearing whether or not you’ve come across them before. Messages like pain and struggle are necessary and unavoidable parts of life. That rising up to challenges and facing hard truths about ourselves help us grow as well as make us stronger at weathering the shit life inevitably throws our way. That failure - so long as we learn from it - eventually leads to success so we shouldn’t be afraid to keep trying even if we’ll probably fail. That dissatisfaction and being uncomfortable are good as they motivate us to change and improve ourselves and our circumstances. I agree that perspective and values are important and that adjusting these can lead to a more satisfying existence. This means accepting that you’ll probably never be rich and famous, that you’re probably not an undiscovered genius or great artist, or that anything you’ll ever do will have any lasting impact on future generations. And that realisation can be freeing to pursue the things that only matter to you.As Manson notes, nothing is certain, which is a profoundly obvious yet difficult lesson I’m slowly learning and re-learning all the time. We also have a tendency to create our own narratives that are confining and are worth exploding as they’re largely bullshit. And I totally agree with and can personally attest that taking more responsibility in your life leads to far greater happiness. Jocko Willink has a similar philosophy: Discipline Equals Freedom. But I don’t buy Manson’s anecdote that when he googled the quote “With great power comes great responsibility” he couldn’t find out who originally said it. As a comics reader, I instantly know it was Spider-Man’s Uncle Ben but I can’t believe a Google search wouldn’t tell him that! He’s right though when he says that excessive freedoms don’t lead to happiness. You only need to look at the toxic Social Justice movement currently poisoning Western politics whose adherents are obsessed with personal freedoms - none of those people are ever happy! His points on the importance of boundaries in relationships and healthy conflict stemming from honesty though were banal and unnecessary. I’m a terrible procrastinator so I really liked the “Do Something” principle where you just do whatever it is you should be doing rather than waiting for the “right moment” or inspiration to strike. The idea is that once you start doing something, especially badly, you’ll eventually start doing it right. Action leads to motivation leads to inspiration leads to success - basically a practical application of not being afraid of failure and one I’ll be trying out myself. I wasn’t that interested in Manson’s autobiographical anecdotes, which were mostly mundane, nor did I find a lot of the examples he chose to illustrate his ideas to be that compelling, though I do like the possibility that Shakespeare wrote Romeo & Juliet as a satire on love especially as so many view it as the ultimate romance story! I also don’t agree that caring less about something means you’ll do better at it or that great people become great because they don’t think they’re great which is why they work harder than most. Both are, like a lot of the statements he makes, an oversimplified generalisation. Maybe he’s right for some but maybe some others already think they’re great and are driven by something else? And, like all self-help books, it needs to be vague enough to be a one-size fits all for the widest possible appeal so I’m not sure how helpful it’s going to be in finding its audience’s meaning in their individual lives - it certainly didn’t mine! But on the whole Manson is a decent writer who’s able to put his ideas across quite clearly in an accessible way. The messaging may be fairly commonplace and underwhelming but I found enough good stuff here to have gotten something out of reading it and if you’ve read no self-help books at all you might find this even more useful! The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck is kinda worth giving a fuck about, just don’t expect much from it. "

So I haven't read this book yet, but here's a short play about one of the most ridiculous encounters regarding this book.Hesitant Customer (without children - this is important): ""Could I please see the Subtle Art of not Giving a....""Jen: ""Fuck?""Indignant Customer: ""Yes.""The customer flips through the book. Her lip curls at the sight of ""shit"" and her eyebrows furrow at every ""fuck"" thrown by Mark Manson.Condescending Customer: ""Is there a version of this book without cursing?

The purpose of the book is to stop worrying about bullshit and fuckery that you worry about in life. If you're worried about the word ""fuck"", you need this book more than anyone else.

191,0062457713,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3643764-esil,4,"3.5 starsI’m not sure what possessed me to listen to this audiobook. I have ZERO interest in self help books. But once I started, I thought it was good enough to keep going.The title is there for shock value, but it’s not a particularly shocking book, unless you’re easily put off by swearing. The author is not really advocating that we all drop everything and run to the beach. He’s arguing for recalibrating what matters to you, and acting on it.The secondary title - “a counterintuitive approach to living a good life” - is deceptive. There’s nothing counterintuitive here. There’s a lot of common sense. But it’s pretty good common sense. And also timely in many ways. So I didn’t have any aha moments, but I nodded my head a fair bit.The question that kept buzzing at the back of my mind is how likely people are to be able to make dramatic changes in their lives by being told to shift the focus on what matters to them. In other words, easier said than done. But still worth thinking about every now and then.I think I’ll stick to my ZERO self help books policy, but this wasn’t a bad foray out of my usual comfort zones."
192,0062457713,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22371819-mariah-roze,4,This was a great book! I've been seeing it everywhere so I wanted to read it. This book was great at reminding you that you shouldn't care what other people think. It is important to do what you want and what your heart wants. It also reminds you that you don't need to be famous or have a spectacular life to have a great life. This is YOUR life. Do what YOU want!
193,0062457713,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45341691-israt-zaman-disha,4,"""The desire for more positive experience is itself a negative experience. And, paradoxically, the acceptance of one’s negative experience is itself a positive experience.""I never thought of reading this book. Saw a hype about it recently in a group on facebook. So I just wanted to know what this book is about. After reading the blurb on goodreads, I thought to give it a go, see what's the hype about. So I started listening to the audiobook. ""Not giving a fuck does not mean being indifferent; it means being comfortable with being different.""First thing I learned from this book is, never judge a book by its cover or title or first chapter. In the first chapter, the author said f*ck like a 100 times. I think there was no need to said that word this many times. I don't have any problem with saying fuck. But when I read/listen to fuck this many times in just one chapter, I cannot help but feel irritated. So yeah, I was irritated but decided to go on. And I am glad of my decision. ""Maturity is what happens when one learns to only give a fuck about what’s truly fuckworthy.""I don't think this book is an inspiring one. The writer didn't want to tell people how to be motivated or how to be a successful person. He simply told how to be happy in life. What is the mantra behind peace and happiness in one's life. And I have to say I totally agree. And that mantra is not giving a fuck. Well, now some may think that not giving a fuck means being indifferent to everything. But that's not true. There's a very thin line between being indifferent and being indifferent to the things that are not important in life. Mark Manson talked about this difference and how we care about everything. In this book, he shared many of his thoughts about happiness, emotion, sufferings, values, responsibilities, rejections, and relations of our life. And I agree with most of the things he said. You can say I am bragging but I found that my thoughts and ideas about life are a lot like Mark Manson. And yes I was lame and pathetic once. But I am growing. I am learning the subtle art of not giving a fuck. ""Being wrong opens us up to the possibility of change. Being wrong brings the opportunity for growth.""One thing I love while reading something is when I find some character I can relate to real life. And this book was full of it. Sometimes I find someone who is exactly like my friend, then someone pretty much like my boss and finally someone a lot like me. It was a major point why I liked this book. ""There is a simple realization from which all personal improvement and growth emerge. This is the realization that we, individually, are responsible for everything in our lives, no matter the external circumstances. We don’t always control what happens to us. But we always control how we interpret what happens to us, as well as how we respond. Whether we consciously recognize it or not, we are always responsible for our experiences.""There's one thing that I didn't understand the last chapter. And I was thinking of giving a star less for it. Then I thought maybe I haven't grown that much yet. So yeah I will reread the last chapter after two or three years and see if it makes any sense. So 5 stars for now... :D ""To be happy we need something to solve. Happiness is, therefore, a form of action..."""
194,0062457713,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38414168-ashish-iyer,2,"It starts off really well but then starts to drag out. The things mentioned in the book are logical and make immense sense, they're also presented with interesting and sometimes personal issues to get the idea. Manson's writing is straight to the point and natural; it flows like a conversation rather than a self-help rant. All this, and I still couldn't find much enthusiasm for the things being said because I find them to be basic things that I've always believed. It did give me a few things to consider and maybe look up, but I don't get why people keep telling me that it's ""life changing."""

It’s less about not giving a fuck and more about what is worth giving a fuck about. And there are things that are worth giving a fuck about! In fact, Manson tells us that having problems is a good thing… only it’s important that we fill our lives mostly with problems that we want to have. Sound confusing? Read the book. He’ll also hit it home that life isn’t fair or easy, and it’s not supposed to be. In fact, if it was you’d be bored to death and would be way less happy than you think you’d be.— Wallace Yovetichfrom The Best Books We Read In January 2017: http://bookriot.com/2017/02/01/riot-r...

I even highlighted tons of favorite quotes from this book, whenever I feel anxious, stressed, or depressed I read those quote and trust me it really ease my mind.“Who you are is defined by what you’re willing to struggle for.” The funny thing is I had no expectation from this book, I just decided to read it because I've seen many people were talking about this book. I am not much into self-help books. When I started to read this book, I knew immediately I would love it. This book doesn't sugarcoat anything. It's blunt, true, and makes you realize not to waste your emotional energy. You should know when and where you should give a fuck and when or where you shouldn't.

They're usually written by preachy, entitled people who believe they've ""made it"" telling you what to do and how to think, as if you're a brainless amoeba lapping up their greatness. This book is no different. Filled mainly with questionable anecdotes and retellings of things we already know, I kept on reading for some actual substance.

So, lots of advice that most of us probably already know, but will still likely leave you feeling motivated."
199,0062457713,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62428250-karina,4,"First off, I am not much of a self-help reader: not because I think I am perfect and have nothing to learn about myself but because it usually feels like it's a know-it-all slimy salesman telling me what is ""wrong"" with the person I am. BUT Mark Manson had a wonderful approach to his book. He is just a normal person without all that Botox and designer jeans that made his butt look bigger telling me he has many things HE has to work on a daily basis and what he had to overcome to not be a piece of shit psycho. I had to return the book to its rightful owner so I can't pick out my favorite quotes (and I'm not buying it for $30) but this book is very quotable and very raw.I have always known I am a people pleaser and I really hate that trait about me because I put myself in awkward positions and then resent the person I want to help because 1. They weren't grateful enough 2. They will never ever return the favor 3. They turned out to be shitty people. 4. I am just annoyed!So yes, it okay to say NO to people. I don't have to care about every little cause and I should definitely have my priorities straight. Stop being fake and surround yourself with people that are meaningful to you. Just do and see what happens from there. You are not unique and your problems are not unique so once you realize this you can just live your life without that carrot dangling over your sleep. With failure you learn about who you are and can grow as a person. Just because you failed at something doesn't mean you are a failure. Social media life is fake so you are not pathetic for not eating at Spago for lunch or being in the Caribbean this year. Be true to the person you want to be. There was more to it and Manson had some great stories in there. My Negatives- He said ""Fuck"" wwwaaayyy too much. I get it. That's the damn title of the book.Sometimes got repetitive.Overall- recommend."

I wouldn’t normally reach for a self help book, but Mark Moran’s The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck: A Counterintuitive Approach to Living a Good Life, was the pick for our book club this month. It also formed part of challenge read on 'read a self help guide' I have going with a fellow bookworm. I decided to give this book a chance and I went into reading it with an open mind, despite my reservations about the bold title. I surprised myself by enjoying this book. I found it a highly readable, direct, humorous and relatable guide. I wouldn’t say this is a self help book as such, but more a strategy in self evaluation. Many of the ideas and approaches Moran suggests we should take to change our lives are simple to implement and most probably have in the back of our minds – yet Moran suggest what we lack is courage to act on this. What Moran does is put these ideas in spotlight and his book works to give the reader the encouragement needed to put his notions into practice. What I appreciated the most about The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck was insertion of real life stories within this text. Moran linked his approaches to concrete scenarios, which gave his guide much more brevity. From the author Moran’s own back story from hitting rock bottom to becoming a blogger extraordinaire, to celebrity examples such as former Beatles drummer Pete Best and even World War II survivours - the message is clear in all cases. What almost breaks you may in fact make you a stronger, happier and better person. "

For me, I am the Anti-Self-Development type, however, sometimes I give a book or two a chance to make a difference and change my mind. And that truly rarely or never happens. I am one of those whom are fed up with all those toxic self-development books. That type of books like: How to achieve greatness, How to win and influence people, how to be rich, etc, etc. This book is completely as it states the ""Counterintuitive approach to Living a Good Life"", the, as I'd love to put it, ""Anti-Self development book of really good life"". So whatever reader are you, this book is for you!""The Subtle Art of Not Giving A F*ck""The moment you read the title you think: ""Really! Could this even be a title?!""A title that will either scare you out to give it a try, or will burn your eagerness to know what it is all about. To be honest, I am freaked out to write a review about this book. I finished the book a day earlier but had no guts to start on writing a review. But as I recently feel obliged to write a review about every single book that I read, thus it seemed inevitable to write it sooner or later. So here we go. Fasten your seat belt!If you have ever heard of Charles Bukowski, Buddha, Hiroo Onoda, Norio Suzuki, Dave Mustaine, Pete Best, William James, Malala Yousafzai, Meredith Maran, Pablo Picasso, Romeo & Juliet, Ernest Becker, then trust me, you will learn their stories again in a very different way that will seize your mind and leave you completely astonished.This book will help you know why all the other self-development books didn't help you or anyone else through the principle of the Feedback Loop from Hell.It will tell you why we are always searching for the happiness and what should the true happiness be from everyone's own perspective.Moreover it will accuse you, and me, of overrating certain life aspects. You will also get to meet the Disappointment Panda and figure out how would you deal with him.You will learn by yourself how everyone is given to choose their own struggles.You will know that it is not a must to me the superhero and the very special person in that exaggerating behavior, in a matter of fact, thus everyone should be one! Nevertheless not lowering or diminishing the value of being one!It will tear you apart while knowing the value of suffering, the shitty values and great values through The Self-Awarness Onion.Furthermore, it will condemn you of your responsibilities and all the freedom of choice you have. It will hit you on the head by letting you ask yourself: ""What if I am wrong about everything?"" Last but not least, It will grab you by the arm to know that failure, pain and rejection are part of the process by getting to know the Do Something principle.
This book is about everything in your life. It isn't limited to career topics or relationship styling. But rather to a higher and more intellectual state of mind and reason. This book is for you!This book is not rocket science, it doesn't inform us of new matters that were unknown to us. Rather it tells you exactly what you already know, what is standing right in front of your nose, down in simple, friendly, invasive words that will leave you seeing things much more different than before.I have made it across a lot of various books, but this book is surely different. I believe this book was the hit on the head that I urgely needed to wake up and sort things out differently and to view all my priorities and values with an entirely conscious mind. And to put all my life, past and future, into question!This book will drive you to get hurt facing the inevitable truth, will make you show up your deepest wounds, will leave you in anger, rage and tears depending on what you have encountered in life and the VALUES you are living by.P.S. If you are rigid follower of my reviews you will understand why I underlined the word VALUES and why this book is a so life changing experience to me. As I hope it would be to you too."

I think it's an attempt to piggyback on the success of Marie Kondo's book by being ""inspired"" by the title and hoping people will pay money without looking too hard at the contents of the book."
203,0062457713,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67160575-sara,5,"I am amazed by this book and everything that was in it! Mark Manson really speaks the truth and talks about important issues that are part of our lives. But it takes time, effort and great amount of work on yourself to get to that state of mind he's talking about. We easily fall into routine and complain about it, but not everyone is willing to break the cycle. I think I need to read this book every year.„Don’t just sit there. Do something. The answers will follow.“"

Finally the author tried to make a case that those involved in grief had a choice on how to deal with it citing a parent dealing with child loss and totally lost me At no point in your rambling, incoherent response were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought. Everyone in this room is now dumber for having listened to it. I award you no points Mr Manson, and may God have mercy on your soul."
205,0062457713,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31777090-sohaib,4,"This book is about setting and honing personal values. It's about determining what to give a fuck about in your life. In Manson's witty words, managing the amount of fucks you give. Minimizing the scope of your interests really—to the essentials. Putting all of your eggs in that one basket. Figuring out what that basket is in the first place. Does that make sense?I enjoyed a couple of ideas. One of them is on the importance of cultivating doubt. Manson claims that uncertainty is the way forward and that the key to personal growth lies in being comfortable with it. The comfort breeds an openness that obliterates sticking to rigid values and motivates us towards positive change. Uncertainty breaks the entitlement chain, the belief that you're a special snowflake who deserves special treatment from the world—the naivety of expecting something for nothing, to be loved for doing nothing, to be appreciated for doing nothing, and so on. To break the hold of the spell of certainty and entitlement, Mr. Manson proposes asking yourself three golden questions:1- What if I'm wrong? 2- What would it mean if I'm wrong? 3- Would me being wrong create better problems? I tried them for size and trust me, the sheer entertaining of the possibility of being wrong is refreshing. Also wonderful in cultivating compassion, humility, and acceptance of oneself and others. The success formula Manson proposes goes something like this:Happiness comes from solving problems, and the quality of your problems is determined by the quality of your values and metrics, the standards by which you measure your success. Naturally, the better the problems, the more successful you are. Good problems come from having good values and metrics. And so Manson dedicates more than half of his book to what he sees as the five most important values, and he summarizes them on page 89 in one paragraph:""The first ... is a radical form of responsibility: taking responsibility for everything that occurs in your life, regardless of who's at fault. The second is uncertainty: the acknowledgment of your own ignorance and the cultivation of constant doubt in your own beliefs. The next is failure ... The fourth is rejection: the ability to both say and hear no ... The final value is the contemplation of one's own mortality.""Another idea that stuck is the Do Something Principle, the idea that action can and sometimes should precede motivation. This reminded me of Ralph Waldo Emerson's famous quote: ""Do the thing and you shall have the power."" Most of us, unfortunately, spend our entire lives waiting for that power to come down, waiting for the muse instead of moving in the direction of our dreams. Action > Inspiration > Motivation > Action... (Loop) In the end, The Subtle Art is a sobering unconventional take on self-help, and I recommend it for people looking for just that. Three stars and a half, with a grain of salt. My rating came down from four and a half thanks to me cultivating doubt about this book. So here goes that Mr. Manson."

""Everything worthwhile in life is won through surmounting the associated negative experience. Any attempt to escape the negative, to avoid it or quash it or silence it, only backfires. The avoidance of suffering is a form of suffering. The avoidance of struggle is a struggle. The denial of failure is a failure. Hiding what is shameful is itself a form of shame.Pain is an inextricable thread in the fabric of life, and to tear it out is not only impossible, but destructive: attempting to tear it out unravels everything else with it. To try to avoid pain is to give too many fucks about pain. In contrast, if you’re able to not give a fuck about the pain, you become unstoppable.""
I can't explain how much i love this book. It was even more fun listening to it than reading it. Plus, it's a very short listen; about 6 hours if I remember correctly. It starts off pretty light-hearted and funny with some good points. Then it gets pretty heavy by the end. The last 2 chapter were probably my favorite. It's not a book about giving no fucks at all, only psychopaths and liars don't care about anything, but more so about figuring out what is worthy of the fucks you'll give. Whether you think you give too many fucks or aren't sure what to give a fuck about, read this book. At the very least it's worth using one of your audible credits on. "
207,0062457713,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6168938-zoe,3,Nothing illuminating in this book but it is VERY funny. What the writer wrote about is something we know but often forget. So it was a good reminder for us to focus on the important things. 
208,0062457713,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18989854-krystal,4,"First up, the title is clearly more for shock factor than an accurate title for this book since f*cks are still given, albeit selectively.Second, if bad language, crass stories and vulgar honesty offend you, this may not be an appropriate choice of reading material.Thirdly, these are not particularly new concepts. For alternative reads without the swearing and vulgarity, I'd recommend Daring Greatly: How the Courage to Be Vulnerable Transforms the Way We Live, Love, Parent, and Lead (my 5 star review here) and/or The Courage to be Disliked (my 4 star review here) I'm not a huge fan of swearing etc. myself but this was more about bluntness and simplicity rather than swearing for the sake of it so I didn't mind it quite so much. It's just honest and raw and is quite serious about making its point that no one and nothing is perfect.The point of this book is not to stop 'giving a f*ck', but to choose wisely the things you decide to care about. It raises the fairly common notion that true happiness is beyond the material, and caring about things you can't change (such as others' feelings) will do more harm than good. These ideas are something I definitely connect with, and I do think it's important to take responsibility for your own happiness. Yes, sometimes sh*tty things happen, but you have to find a way through the sh*t to ultimately become stronger, otherwise you're giving up happiness in favour of being a victim.The delivery is certainly not for everyone as there's no sympathy here, and the apathetic will be disappointed because instead of finding a common ideal this book hits with some hard truths. People who are offended easily will find plenty to be offended about, and it's easy to criticise the author for his sexist examples and analogies and the despicable behaviour of his past (which we only know because he has chosen to share). It starts with the message, 'don't try' and concludes with '...and then you die' and in between is a whole lot of 'you are not special', which honestly all sounds quite depressing but it really does make a lot of sense. It tells us we are not special, but then goes on to suggest why that might be so painful to hear. If you are open-minded, you'll understand and perhaps appreciate the wisdom in it; if you're more stubborn you'll close your eyes, cover your ears and repeat to yourself that you are special, no matter what this crappy little book says (thus increasing the pressure on yourself to be special). All in all, the book makes a lot of sense, but you have to be open and accepting enough to appreciate it.Side note: I was really surprised there were no references listed, considering how many names were dropped and psychology experiments referenced etc. Curious.If this rubbed you up the wrong way I'd definitely suggest giving Daring Greatly a chance, as it's a much more comprehensive (and kind) exploration of the same themes.This was book 24 in my #Dymocks52challenge refined.

The book is a reaction to the self-help industry and what Manson saw as a culture of mindless positivity that isn't practical or helpful for most people. Manson uses many of his own personal experiences to illustrate how life's struggles often give it more meaning, which, he argues, is a better approach than constantly trying to be happy. Manson's approach and writing style have been categorized by some as contrarian to the general self-help industry, using blunt honesty and profanity to illustrate his ideas.The book has 9 chapters with the following titles:1. Don't Try.2. Happiness is a problem.3. You are not special.4. The value of suffering.5. You are always choosing.6. You are wrong about everything (But so am I).7. Failure is the way forward.8.

So I agree that action can bring about inspiration which can lead to motivation. "

This book offers a is a zero-nonsense approach to self-help concepts. I’ve heard most of it before but the author delivers the message in a concise, sorry-if-it-hurts, straight-forward way.I found some of the advice helpful and I’m glad I read it. I understand now why it might resonate with many people and recommend it to those always seeking to improve themselves."

Instead I got a collection of banal insights, wrapped in supposedly funny dirty-talk. References to philosophy/literature were reminiscent of an author who just skimmed through ""100 ideas in X you need to know"" and didn't bother further. They were forced and off-beat especially considering the overall tone, which itself fluctuated between the earnestness of self-help drivel and the tongue-in-cheek of comedy memoirs. Ironically, this was the only convincing argument made to support the point on making choices to narrow down your options. Looks like the author didn’t even follow his own advice."

But I've seen this one floating around and it's been getting some great reviews so I got curious and decided to check this one out. I listened to the audiobook and was able to get through it in a few days. Now I know why I don't read self help books. I don't know why but it comes across as so pretentious to me, and hearing Mark Manson ramble on for so long about ""not giving a fuck"" and ""only giving a fuck about the things that matter"" it just felt to me like he was trying too hard. Also, he's a privileged white man and some of this felt very douche-y to me. Like him talking about how he tells his wife when she doesn't look good because honesty is more important... like okay. I just didn't enjoy this the way I thought I might. I don't think self help books are for me. "

Book has no originality and better writers have written more brilliantly about these topics. Entire thing boils down to irritating, naive, amateur psychology from a douchebag in serious ignorance of his douchebaggery. The book suffers from the problem of extremes. In this case, in attempting to correct for admittedly nauseating over positivity bullshit, the author is now guilty of the same crap in the opposite direction - an over glorification of suffering. This is just as much of a crap fest as what he claims to be avoiding. Laughable part is that dude is an entitled little shithead who's got no understanding of suffering. There's even more considerable lack of understanding of medical/scientific research and on some level he seems to believe that people with real psychological issues should just get over themselves cause everyone has problems. When a human being gets to a point where he can equate his self imposed drugged infused decade of ""trauma"" stemming from his parents divorce to the real trauma of a father losing his son, that's serious entitled bullshit! To conclude that someone who has suffered through hellish circumstances can just move on based on cherry picked examples of celebrities making it, is pathetically superficial. This kind of crappy thinking is what results in selfish individuals who can only empathize with others if they have gone through similar experiences themselves. Books like this don't move the dial in improving humanity, they just create/justify narcissistic characters who hide their narcissism behind a wall of false self improvement. This author is no different from the cultish positivity people he scorns. He spews the same sanctimonious, bullshit rhetoric where he pats himself on the back by stating how his values help make the world better! His whole unoriginal theory of put on your big boy panties and get over yourself mentality is just as terrible as the whole disappear into some zen bullshit crapfest. It's this kind of mentality that makes people say if I could make it, I don't get why anyone else can't either. It fails to recognize differences in circumstances. I'm all for suck it up and deal with life but the ability to fail to recognize that maybe the dad with the dead kid has suffered more pain than the asshole with the cheating ex girlfriend is ludicrous! What this guy has done is surround himself with folks so obviously dysfunctional, he ends up looking like the king in a world of spectacular ignorance. The question that should be asked as he gives multiple examples of his idiotic friends being assholes, is how has he managed to collect so many terrible people in his circle? What does this say about his values and judgement? In the end, author is no different from his douchebag ""friend"" he described in the earlier chapters except unlike the friend who limited himself to sponging off of relatives, this dude has expanded his narcissistic reach to a wider audience. Still playing the victim of the trauma of his parents divorce, still standing for nothing except the right to say what he wants, when he wants to whoever he wants. There's a word for people like that - douchebag! "
217,0062457713,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16131467-nate-icart,1,"I absolutely hated this book. Reasons why:-The author's jokes were terrible. His style of humor is just to add a random number to an example (""I felt like I was punched 253 times in the stomach""). -Many (most) of the concepts in this book are ripped from common bodies of knowledge (he explains the basic economic concept of opportunity cost like he was the one who discovered it)-His experiences all feel fake. He talks about how came to deep realizations about his life when we was a fresh college graduate -- not that this is impossible, just very unlikely.-The first few chapters have the word ""Fuck"" in them so much that it just feels like he's making excuses to say it. I like swearing, but every time he talks about sex he calls it ""fucking"". No one talks like that.-It's very hard to take a 32 year old self-help guru seriously when they don't have a real life like the rest of us. He's been a world-traveler and an extremely popular blogger for years. He explained that he only held a ""real"" job for 6 weeks post-graduation. Who can relate to this?-The best part about this book is the cover. Manson is good at marketing, and he's good in short-form (like on his blog), but I will never read another book that he writes."
218,0062457713,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30279227-ts-chan,3,"3.5 stars.I don't usually reach for self-help books. However, the title of this book piqued my curiosity and it perpetually appears on the main page of Audible as a best seller, thus furthering my interest to pick it up. As an audiobook, I did enjoy this quite a fair bit as the narrator was good and brought life to the narrative. Admittedly, the advice contained herein was not ground-breaking, but delivered in a refreshing and humourous manner. It served as a reminder as to what we probably already know in the deep, dark recesses of our minds, but are too caught up in the hectic modern life and excesses for greater inner reflection. I find a few of the real-life examples quoted to be quite relevant and effective.

Who you are is defined by what you're willing to struggle for.

The title is slightly misleading as the book is not so much as to how not to give a f*ck but to choose what is important enough to give a f*ck about. It is about getting our priorities and values right so that we pick the right battles which truly matter in making our lives count for something. If we start giving a f*ck about every little thing, we will end up spending too much energy on trivial matters and being generally uncontented about life. While it is fine not to feel positive all the time, learning how to channel that in the right direction and taking charge of your life where it is possible to make a difference are the essential messages the book is getting across to the reader. The one theme that was discussed which I feel very strongly about was concerning the 'sense of entitlement' and how this can be destructive in the way one views his or her life. And social media is probably the biggest culprit in propagating this negative view to a whole new level. Being constantly bombarded with reality shows, Instagrams and blogs of beautiful people enjoying a beautiful life, we start to ask ""Why can't I be like so-and-so?"" or ""Why can't I have this or that too?"". As a 14-year old niece of mine rightly pointed out, Instagram represents filtered existence. It seems almost natural now for most to block out the unfavourable or darker segments of life or humanity - such as poverty, hunger, war, violence, human trafficking, prostitution, etc. Instead, we moan and groan about the 'unfortunate circumstances' of not being able to own nice cars and big houses, have great clothes and the requisite body to go with it, go on expensive holidays, or obtain that 'much-deserved' promotion at work - the list goes on and on.Anyway, I'm rambling - this is a topic that I can go on and on about, but that's not the point about this review. If you're curious, this is worth a read as it is quite funny and does not take up much time to finish. Even though much of what is said was nothing new, sometimes we just need that extra nudge.This review can also be found at Booknest"
219,0062457713,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5759543-sam-quixote,3,"Eye-catching title, eh? Unfortunately that’s about all that really stands out about Mark Manson’s The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck, which is actually a very ordinary self-help book - and I’ve not even read a lot of self-help books either, that’s how broad, generic and unremarkable a lot of the stuff he talks about here is! Still, its ideas are ultimately positive and worth re-reading and keeping in mind so I can’t say I found the book a total waste of time. The book’s title and main thesis can be summed up as: finding and caring about the shit that matters to you while ignoring the shit that doesn’t - see what I mean when I say it’s unremarkable? But wait, there’s more! Manson has more vapid platitudes like how life’s about the journey, not the destination, how finding meaning in life is better than accumulating material possessions, and that, seeing as we’re all going to die one day, why waste our limited time on shit that doesn’t matter? Not that I disagree with any of that but there’s nothing new or special about that information and you definitely don’t need to read this book to hear that kind of stuff. In fact, you don’t even need to read it anywhere at all as these ideas are so ubiquitous in pop culture as to be cliched! But, like I said, the book also contains useful messages that are worth hearing whether or not you’ve come across them before. Messages like pain and struggle are necessary and unavoidable parts of life. That rising up to challenges and facing hard truths about ourselves help us grow as well as make us stronger at weathering the shit life inevitably throws our way. That failure - so long as we learn from it - eventually leads to success so we shouldn’t be afraid to keep trying even if we’ll probably fail. That dissatisfaction and being uncomfortable are good as they motivate us to change and improve ourselves and our circumstances. I agree that perspective and values are important and that adjusting these can lead to a more satisfying existence. This means accepting that you’ll probably never be rich and famous, that you’re probably not an undiscovered genius or great artist, or that anything you’ll ever do will have any lasting impact on future generations. And that realisation can be freeing to pursue the things that only matter to you.As Manson notes, nothing is certain, which is a profoundly obvious yet difficult lesson I’m slowly learning and re-learning all the time. We also have a tendency to create our own narratives that are confining and are worth exploding as they’re largely bullshit. And I totally agree with and can personally attest that taking more responsibility in your life leads to far greater happiness. Jocko Willink has a similar philosophy: Discipline Equals Freedom. But I don’t buy Manson’s anecdote that when he googled the quote “With great power comes great responsibility” he couldn’t find out who originally said it. As a comics reader, I instantly know it was Spider-Man’s Uncle Ben but I can’t believe a Google search wouldn’t tell him that! He’s right though when he says that excessive freedoms don’t lead to happiness. You only need to look at the toxic Social Justice movement currently poisoning Western politics whose adherents are obsessed with personal freedoms - none of those people are ever happy! His points on the importance of boundaries in relationships and healthy conflict stemming from honesty though were banal and unnecessary. I’m a terrible procrastinator so I really liked the “Do Something” principle where you just do whatever it is you should be doing rather than waiting for the “right moment” or inspiration to strike. The idea is that once you start doing something, especially badly, you’ll eventually start doing it right. Action leads to motivation leads to inspiration leads to success - basically a practical application of not being afraid of failure and one I’ll be trying out myself. I wasn’t that interested in Manson’s autobiographical anecdotes, which were mostly mundane, nor did I find a lot of the examples he chose to illustrate his ideas to be that compelling, though I do like the possibility that Shakespeare wrote Romeo & Juliet as a satire on love especially as so many view it as the ultimate romance story! I also don’t agree that caring less about something means you’ll do better at it or that great people become great because they don’t think they’re great which is why they work harder than most. Both are, like a lot of the statements he makes, an oversimplified generalisation. Maybe he’s right for some but maybe some others already think they’re great and are driven by something else? And, like all self-help books, it needs to be vague enough to be a one-size fits all for the widest possible appeal so I’m not sure how helpful it’s going to be in finding its audience’s meaning in their individual lives - it certainly didn’t mine! But on the whole Manson is a decent writer who’s able to put his ideas across quite clearly in an accessible way. The messaging may be fairly commonplace and underwhelming but I found enough good stuff here to have gotten something out of reading it and if you’ve read no self-help books at all you might find this even more useful! The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck is kinda worth giving a fuck about, just don’t expect much from it. "

Her lip curls at the sight of ""shit"" and her eyebrows furrow at every ""fuck"" thrown by Mark Manson.Condescending Customer: ""Is there a version of this book without cursing? I feel that it is unnecessary...""Jen's jaw drops: That would defeat the purpose of -Awesome colleague grabs an empty journal: Here we go.

221,0062457713,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3643764-esil,4,"3.5 starsI’m not sure what possessed me to listen to this audiobook. I have ZERO interest in self help books. But once I started, I thought it was good enough to keep going.The title is there for shock value, but it’s not a particularly shocking book, unless you’re easily put off by swearing. The author is not really advocating that we all drop everything and run to the beach. He’s arguing for recalibrating what matters to you, and acting on it.The secondary title - “a counterintuitive approach to living a good life” - is deceptive. There’s nothing counterintuitive here. There’s a lot of common sense. But it’s pretty good common sense. And also timely in many ways. So I didn’t have any aha moments, but I nodded my head a fair bit.The question that kept buzzing at the back of my mind is how likely people are to be able to make dramatic changes in their lives by being told to shift the focus on what matters to them. In other words, easier said than done. But still worth thinking about every now and then.I think I’ll stick to my ZERO self help books policy, but this wasn’t a bad foray out of my usual comfort zones."
222,0062457713,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22371819-mariah-roze,4,This was a great book! I've been seeing it everywhere so I wanted to read it. This book was great at reminding you that you shouldn't care what other people think. It is important to do what you want and what your heart wants. It also reminds you that you don't need to be famous or have a spectacular life to have a great life. This is YOUR life. Do what YOU want!
223,0062457713,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45341691-israt-zaman-disha,4,"""The desire for more positive experience is itself a negative experience. And, paradoxically, the acceptance of one’s negative experience is itself a positive experience.""I never thought of reading this book. Saw a hype about it recently in a group on facebook. So I just wanted to know what this book is about. After reading the blurb on goodreads, I thought to give it a go, see what's the hype about. So I started listening to the audiobook. ""Not giving a fuck does not mean being indifferent; it means being comfortable with being different.""First thing I learned from this book is, never judge a book by its cover or title or first chapter. In the first chapter, the author said f*ck like a 100 times. I think there was no need to said that word this many times. I don't have any problem with saying fuck. But when I read/listen to fuck this many times in just one chapter, I cannot help but feel irritated. So yeah, I was irritated but decided to go on. And I am glad of my decision. ""Maturity is what happens when one learns to only give a fuck about what’s truly fuckworthy.""I don't think this book is an inspiring one. The writer didn't want to tell people how to be motivated or how to be a successful person. He simply told how to be happy in life. What is the mantra behind peace and happiness in one's life. And I have to say I totally agree. And that mantra is not giving a fuck. Well, now some may think that not giving a fuck means being indifferent to everything. But that's not true. There's a very thin line between being indifferent and being indifferent to the things that are not important in life. Mark Manson talked about this difference and how we care about everything. In this book, he shared many of his thoughts about happiness, emotion, sufferings, values, responsibilities, rejections, and relations of our life. And I agree with most of the things he said. You can say I am bragging but I found that my thoughts and ideas about life are a lot like Mark Manson. And yes I was lame and pathetic once. But I am growing. I am learning the subtle art of not giving a fuck. ""Being wrong opens us up to the possibility of change. Being wrong brings the opportunity for growth.""One thing I love while reading something is when I find some character I can relate to real life. And this book was full of it. Sometimes I find someone who is exactly like my friend, then someone pretty much like my boss and finally someone a lot like me. It was a major point why I liked this book. ""There is a simple realization from which all personal improvement and growth emerge. This is the realization that we, individually, are responsible for everything in our lives, no matter the external circumstances. We don’t always control what happens to us. But we always control how we interpret what happens to us, as well as how we respond. Whether we consciously recognize it or not, we are always responsible for our experiences.""There's one thing that I didn't understand the last chapter. And I was thinking of giving a star less for it. Then I thought maybe I haven't grown that much yet. So yeah I will reread the last chapter after two or three years and see if it makes any sense. So 5 stars for now... :D ""To be happy we need something to solve. Happiness is, therefore, a form of action..."""

The things mentioned in the book are logical and make immense sense, they're also presented with interesting and sometimes personal issues to get the idea. Manson's writing is straight to the point and natural; it flows like a conversation rather than a self-help rant. All this, and I still couldn't find much enthusiasm for the things being said because I find them to be basic things that I've always believed. It did give me a few things to consider and maybe look up, but I don't get why people keep telling me that it's ""life changing."""

It’s less about not giving a fuck and more about what is worth giving a fuck about. And there are things that are worth giving a fuck about! In fact, Manson tells us that having problems is a good thing… only it’s important that we fill our lives mostly with problems that we want to have. Sound confusing? Read the book. He’ll also hit it home that life isn’t fair or easy, and it’s not supposed to be.

I even highlighted tons of favorite quotes from this book, whenever I feel anxious, stressed, or depressed I read those quote and trust me it really ease my mind.“Who you are is defined by what you’re willing to struggle for.” The funny thing is I had no expectation from this book, I just decided to read it because I've seen many people were talking about this book. I am not much into self-help books. When I started to read this book, I knew immediately I would love it. This book doesn't sugarcoat anything. It's blunt, true, and makes you realize not to waste your emotional energy. You should know when and where you should give a fuck and when or where you shouldn't. It will make life a lot different, in a positive way. I would definitely recommend this book."

They're usually written by preachy, entitled people who believe they've ""made it"" telling you what to do and how to think, as if you're a brainless amoeba lapping up their greatness. This book is no different. Filled mainly with questionable anecdotes and retellings of things we already know, I kept on reading for some actual substance. It starts off well enough, but descends into a baseless think piece from the perspective of an entitled white male.

BUT Mark Manson had a wonderful approach to his book. He is just a normal person without all that Botox and designer jeans that made his butt look bigger telling me he has many things HE has to work on a daily basis and what he had to overcome to not be a piece of shit psycho. I had to return the book to its rightful owner so I can't pick out my favorite quotes (and I'm not buying it for $30) but this book is very quotable and very raw.I have always known I am a people pleaser and I really hate that trait about me because I put myself in awkward positions and then resent the person I want to help because 1. They weren't grateful enough 2. They will never ever return the favor 3. They turned out to be shitty people. 4. I am just annoyed!So yes, it okay to say NO to people. I don't have to care about every little cause and I should definitely have my priorities straight. Stop being fake and surround yourself with people that are meaningful to you. Just do and see what happens from there. You are not unique and your problems are not unique so once you realize this you can just live your life without that carrot dangling over your sleep. With failure you learn about who you are and can grow as a person. Just because you failed at something doesn't mean you are a failure. Social media life is fake so you are not pathetic for not eating at Spago for lunch or being in the Caribbean this year. Be true to the person you want to be. There was more to it and Manson had some great stories in there. My Negatives- He said ""Fuck"" wwwaaayyy too much. I get it. That's the damn title of the book.Sometimes got repetitive.Overall- recommend."

I wouldn’t normally reach for a self help book, but Mark Moran’s The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck: A Counterintuitive Approach to Living a Good Life, was the pick for our book club this month. It also formed part of challenge read on 'read a self help guide' I have going with a fellow bookworm. I decided to give this book a chance and I went into reading it with an open mind, despite my reservations about the bold title. I surprised myself by enjoying this book. I found it a highly readable, direct, humorous and relatable guide. I wouldn’t say this is a self help book as such, but more a strategy in self evaluation. Many of the ideas and approaches Moran suggests we should take to change our lives are simple to implement and most probably have in the back of our minds – yet Moran suggest what we lack is courage to act on this. What Moran does is put these ideas in spotlight and his book works to give the reader the encouragement needed to put his notions into practice. What I appreciated the most about The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck was insertion of real life stories within this text. Moran linked his approaches to concrete scenarios, which gave his guide much more brevity. From the author Moran’s own back story from hitting rock bottom to becoming a blogger extraordinaire, to celebrity examples such as former Beatles drummer Pete Best and even World War II survivours - the message is clear in all cases. What almost breaks you may in fact make you a stronger, happier and better person. "

I am one of those whom are fed up with all those toxic self-development books. That type of books like: How to achieve greatness, How to win and influence people, how to be rich, etc, etc. This book is completely as it states the ""Counterintuitive approach to Living a Good Life"", the, as I'd love to put it, ""Anti-Self development book of really good life"". So whatever reader are you, this book is for you!""The Subtle Art of Not Giving A F*ck""The moment you read the title you think: ""Really! Could this even be a title?!""A title that will either scare you out to give it a try, or will burn your eagerness to know what it is all about. To be honest, I am freaked out to write a review about this book. I finished the book a day earlier but had no guts to start on writing a review. But as I recently feel obliged to write a review about every single book that I read, thus it seemed inevitable to write it sooner or later. So here we go. Fasten your seat belt!If you have ever heard of Charles Bukowski, Buddha, Hiroo Onoda, Norio Suzuki, Dave Mustaine, Pete Best, William James, Malala Yousafzai, Meredith Maran, Pablo Picasso, Romeo & Juliet, Ernest Becker, then trust me, you will learn their stories again in a very different way that will seize your mind and leave you completely astonished.This book will help you know why all the other self-development books didn't help you or anyone else through the principle of the Feedback Loop from Hell.It will tell you why we are always searching for the happiness and what should the true happiness be from everyone's own perspective.Moreover it will accuse you, and me, of overrating certain life aspects. You will also get to meet the Disappointment Panda and figure out how would you deal with him.You will learn by yourself how everyone is given to choose their own struggles.You will know that it is not a must to me the superhero and the very special person in that exaggerating behavior, in a matter of fact, thus everyone should be one! Nevertheless not lowering or diminishing the value of being one!It will tear you apart while knowing the value of suffering, the shitty values and great values through The Self-Awarness Onion.Furthermore, it will condemn you of your responsibilities and all the freedom of choice you have.

Last but not least, It will grab you by the arm to know that failure, pain and rejection are part of the process by getting to know the Do Something principle.
This book is about everything in your life. It isn't limited to career topics or relationship styling. But rather to a higher and more intellectual state of mind and reason. This book is for you!This book is not rocket science, it doesn't inform us of new matters that were unknown to us. Rather it tells you exactly what you already know, what is standing right in front of your nose, down in simple, friendly, invasive words that will leave you seeing things much more different than before.I have made it across a lot of various books, but this book is surely different. I believe this book was the hit on the head that I urgely needed to wake up and sort things out differently and to view all my priorities and values with an entirely conscious mind. And to put all my life, past and future, into question!This book will drive you to get hurt facing the inevitable truth, will make you show up your deepest wounds, will leave you in anger, rage and tears depending on what you have encountered in life and the VALUES you are living by.P.S.

I think it's an attempt to piggyback on the success of Marie Kondo's book by being ""inspired"" by the title and hoping people will pay money without looking too hard at the contents of the book."

Mark Manson really speaks the truth and talks about important issues that are part of our lives.

We easily fall into routine and complain about it, but not everyone is willing to break the cycle. I think I need to read this book every year.„Don’t just sit there. Do something.

Everyone in this room is now dumber for having listened to it. I award you no points Mr Manson, and may God have mercy on your soul."
235,0062457713,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31777090-sohaib,4,"This book is about setting and honing personal values. It's about determining what to give a fuck about in your life. In Manson's witty words, managing the amount of fucks you give. Minimizing the scope of your interests really—to the essentials. Putting all of your eggs in that one basket. Figuring out what that basket is in the first place. Does that make sense?I enjoyed a couple of ideas. One of them is on the importance of cultivating doubt. Manson claims that uncertainty is the way forward and that the key to personal growth lies in being comfortable with it. The comfort breeds an openness that obliterates sticking to rigid values and motivates us towards positive change. Uncertainty breaks the entitlement chain, the belief that you're a special snowflake who deserves special treatment from the world—the naivety of expecting something for nothing, to be loved for doing nothing, to be appreciated for doing nothing, and so on. To break the hold of the spell of certainty and entitlement, Mr. Manson proposes asking yourself three golden questions:1- What if I'm wrong? 2- What would it mean if I'm wrong? 3- Would me being wrong create better problems? I tried them for size and trust me, the sheer entertaining of the possibility of being wrong is refreshing. Also wonderful in cultivating compassion, humility, and acceptance of oneself and others. The success formula Manson proposes goes something like this:Happiness comes from solving problems, and the quality of your problems is determined by the quality of your values and metrics, the standards by which you measure your success. Naturally, the better the problems, the more successful you are. Good problems come from having good values and metrics. And so Manson dedicates more than half of his book to what he sees as the five most important values, and he summarizes them on page 89 in one paragraph:""The first ... is a radical form of responsibility: taking responsibility for everything that occurs in your life, regardless of who's at fault. The second is uncertainty: the acknowledgment of your own ignorance and the cultivation of constant doubt in your own beliefs. The next is failure ... The fourth is rejection: the ability to both say and hear no ... The final value is the contemplation of one's own mortality.""Another idea that stuck is the Do Something Principle, the idea that action can and sometimes should precede motivation. This reminded me of Ralph Waldo Emerson's famous quote: ""Do the thing and you shall have the power."" Most of us, unfortunately, spend our entire lives waiting for that power to come down, waiting for the muse instead of moving in the direction of our dreams. Action > Inspiration > Motivation > Action... (Loop) In the end, The Subtle Art is a sobering unconventional take on self-help, and I recommend it for people looking for just that. Three stars and a half, with a grain of salt. My rating came down from four and a half thanks to me cultivating doubt about this book. So here goes that Mr. Manson."

""Everything worthwhile in life is won through surmounting the associated negative experience. Any attempt to escape the negative, to avoid it or quash it or silence it, only backfires. The avoidance of suffering is a form of suffering. The avoidance of struggle is a struggle. The denial of failure is a failure. Hiding what is shameful is itself a form of shame.Pain is an inextricable thread in the fabric of life, and to tear it out is not only impossible, but destructive: attempting to tear it out unravels everything else with it. To try to avoid pain is to give too many fucks about pain. In contrast, if you’re able to not give a fuck about the pain, you become unstoppable.""
I can't explain how much i love this book. It was even more fun listening to it than reading it. Plus, it's a very short listen; about 6 hours if I remember correctly. It starts off pretty light-hearted and funny with some good points. Then it gets pretty heavy by the end. The last 2 chapter were probably my favorite. It's not a book about giving no fucks at all, only psychopaths and liars don't care about anything, but more so about figuring out what is worthy of the fucks you'll give. Whether you think you give too many fucks or aren't sure what to give a fuck about, read this book. At the very least it's worth using one of your audible credits on. "
237,0062457713,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6168938-zoe,3,Nothing illuminating in this book but it is VERY funny. What the writer wrote about is something we know but often forget. So it was a good reminder for us to focus on the important things. 
238,0062457713,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18989854-krystal,4,"First up, the title is clearly more for shock factor than an accurate title for this book since f*cks are still given, albeit selectively.Second, if bad language, crass stories and vulgar honesty offend you, this may not be an appropriate choice of reading material.Thirdly, these are not particularly new concepts. For alternative reads without the swearing and vulgarity, I'd recommend Daring Greatly: How the Courage to Be Vulnerable Transforms the Way We Live, Love, Parent, and Lead (my 5 star review here) and/or The Courage to be Disliked (my 4 star review here) I'm not a huge fan of swearing etc. myself but this was more about bluntness and simplicity rather than swearing for the sake of it so I didn't mind it quite so much. It's just honest and raw and is quite serious about making its point that no one and nothing is perfect.The point of this book is not to stop 'giving a f*ck', but to choose wisely the things you decide to care about. It raises the fairly common notion that true happiness is beyond the material, and caring about things you can't change (such as others' feelings) will do more harm than good. These ideas are something I definitely connect with, and I do think it's important to take responsibility for your own happiness. Yes, sometimes sh*tty things happen, but you have to find a way through the sh*t to ultimately become stronger, otherwise you're giving up happiness in favour of being a victim.The delivery is certainly not for everyone as there's no sympathy here, and the apathetic will be disappointed because instead of finding a common ideal this book hits with some hard truths. People who are offended easily will find plenty to be offended about, and it's easy to criticise the author for his sexist examples and analogies and the despicable behaviour of his past (which we only know because he has chosen to share). It starts with the message, 'don't try' and concludes with '...and then you die' and in between is a whole lot of 'you are not special', which honestly all sounds quite depressing but it really does make a lot of sense. It tells us we are not special, but then goes on to suggest why that might be so painful to hear. If you are open-minded, you'll understand and perhaps appreciate the wisdom in it; if you're more stubborn you'll close your eyes, cover your ears and repeat to yourself that you are special, no matter what this crappy little book says (thus increasing the pressure on yourself to be special). All in all, the book makes a lot of sense, but you have to be open and accepting enough to appreciate it.Side note: I was really surprised there were no references listed, considering how many names were dropped and psychology experiments referenced etc. Curious.If this rubbed you up the wrong way I'd definitely suggest giving Daring Greatly a chance, as it's a much more comprehensive (and kind) exploration of the same themes.This was book 24 in my #Dymocks52challenge refined.

The book is a reaction to the self-help industry and what Manson saw as a culture of mindless positivity that isn't practical or helpful for most people. Manson uses many of his own personal experiences to illustrate how life's struggles often give it more meaning, which, he argues, is a better approach than constantly trying to be happy. Manson's approach and writing style have been categorized by some as contrarian to the general self-help industry, using blunt honesty and profanity to illustrate his ideas.The book has 9 chapters with the following titles:1.

I was totally into reading it and it seemed great at first, but truthfully, for me, the best chapters were the last two.

Surprisingly, oftentimes, I ended up getting ''into'' whatever action I was performing that I initially wanted to avoid. So I agree that action can bring about inspiration which can lead to motivation. "

I like to browse this list because it shows you what people are actually reading instead of just what people are buying.I find the list more useful than other bestsellers’ list because it tells me which books are engaging people, after all, we’ve all picked up a title and abandoned it after a few pages because it wasn’t interesting or compelling.So, I went ahead and borrowed it from the library. This book offers a is a zero-nonsense approach to self-help concepts. I’ve heard most of it before but the author delivers the message in a concise, sorry-if-it-hurts, straight-forward way.I found some of the advice helpful and I’m glad I read it. I understand now why it might resonate with many people and recommend it to those always seeking to improve themselves."
244,0062457713,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20214132-crankmuffin,2,"I was expecting an enjoyable read on not taking things too seriously. Instead I got a collection of banal insights, wrapped in supposedly funny dirty-talk. References to philosophy/literature were reminiscent of an author who just skimmed through ""100 ideas in X you need to know"" and didn't bother further. They were forced and off-beat especially considering the overall tone, which itself fluctuated between the earnestness of self-help drivel and the tongue-in-cheek of comedy memoirs. Ironically, this was the only convincing argument made to support the point on making choices to narrow down your options. Looks like the author didn’t even follow his own advice."
245,0062457713,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26560207-gabby,2,"I don't read a lot of self help books. In fact, I don't think I've ever read one before this. But I've seen this one floating around and it's been getting some great reviews so I got curious and decided to check this one out. I listened to the audiobook and was able to get through it in a few days. Now I know why I don't read self help books. I don't know why but it comes across as so pretentious to me, and hearing Mark Manson ramble on for so long about ""not giving a fuck"" and ""only giving a fuck about the things that matter"" it just felt to me like he was trying too hard. Also, he's a privileged white man and some of this felt very douche-y to me. Like him talking about how he tells his wife when she doesn't look good because honesty is more important... like okay. I just didn't enjoy this the way I thought I might. I don't think self help books are for me. "
246,0062457713,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5632120-zaphoddent,1,"Catchy title but fails to deliver on anything concrete. Book has no originality and better writers have written more brilliantly about these topics. Entire thing boils down to irritating, naive, amateur psychology from a douchebag in serious ignorance of his douchebaggery. The book suffers from the problem of extremes. In this case, in attempting to correct for admittedly nauseating over positivity bullshit, the author is now guilty of the same crap in the opposite direction - an over glorification of suffering. This is just as much of a crap fest as what he claims to be avoiding. Laughable part is that dude is an entitled little shithead who's got no understanding of suffering. There's even more considerable lack of understanding of medical/scientific research and on some level he seems to believe that people with real psychological issues should just get over themselves cause everyone has problems. When a human being gets to a point where he can equate his self imposed drugged infused decade of ""trauma"" stemming from his parents divorce to the real trauma of a father losing his son, that's serious entitled bullshit! To conclude that someone who has suffered through hellish circumstances can just move on based on cherry picked examples of celebrities making it, is pathetically superficial. This kind of crappy thinking is what results in selfish individuals who can only empathize with others if they have gone through similar experiences themselves. Books like this don't move the dial in improving humanity, they just create/justify narcissistic characters who hide their narcissism behind a wall of false self improvement. This author is no different from the cultish positivity people he scorns. He spews the same sanctimonious, bullshit rhetoric where he pats himself on the back by stating how his values help make the world better! His whole unoriginal theory of put on your big boy panties and get over yourself mentality is just as terrible as the whole disappear into some zen bullshit crapfest. It's this kind of mentality that makes people say if I could make it, I don't get why anyone else can't either. It fails to recognize differences in circumstances. I'm all for suck it up and deal with life but the ability to fail to recognize that maybe the dad with the dead kid has suffered more pain than the asshole with the cheating ex girlfriend is ludicrous! What this guy has done is surround himself with folks so obviously dysfunctional, he ends up looking like the king in a world of spectacular ignorance. The question that should be asked as he gives multiple examples of his idiotic friends being assholes, is how has he managed to collect so many terrible people in his circle? What does this say about his values and judgement? In the end, author is no different from his douchebag ""friend"" he described in the earlier chapters except unlike the friend who limited himself to sponging off of relatives, this dude has expanded his narcissistic reach to a wider audience. Still playing the victim of the trauma of his parents divorce, still standing for nothing except the right to say what he wants, when he wants to whoever he wants. There's a word for people like that - douchebag! "
247,0062457713,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16131467-nate-icart,1,"I absolutely hated this book. Reasons why:-The author's jokes were terrible. His style of humor is just to add a random number to an example (""I felt like I was punched 253 times in the stomach""). -Many (most) of the concepts in this book are ripped from common bodies of knowledge (he explains the basic economic concept of opportunity cost like he was the one who discovered it)-His experiences all feel fake. He talks about how came to deep realizations about his life when we was a fresh college graduate -- not that this is impossible, just very unlikely.-The first few chapters have the word ""Fuck"" in them so much that it just feels like he's making excuses to say it. I like swearing, but every time he talks about sex he calls it ""fucking"". No one talks like that.-It's very hard to take a 32 year old self-help guru seriously when they don't have a real life like the rest of us. He's been a world-traveler and an extremely popular blogger for years. He explained that he only held a ""real"" job for 6 weeks post-graduation. Who can relate to this?-The best part about this book is the cover. Manson is good at marketing, and he's good in short-form (like on his blog), but I will never read another book that he writes."
248,0062457713,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30279227-ts-chan,3,"3.5 stars.I don't usually reach for self-help books. However, the title of this book piqued my curiosity and it perpetually appears on the main page of Audible as a best seller, thus furthering my interest to pick it up. As an audiobook, I did enjoy this quite a fair bit as the narrator was good and brought life to the narrative. Admittedly, the advice contained herein was not ground-breaking, but delivered in a refreshing and humourous manner. It served as a reminder as to what we probably already know in the deep, dark recesses of our minds, but are too caught up in the hectic modern life and excesses for greater inner reflection. I find a few of the real-life examples quoted to be quite relevant and effective.

Who you are is defined by what you're willing to struggle for.

The title is slightly misleading as the book is not so much as to how not to give a f*ck but to choose what is important enough to give a f*ck about. It is about getting our priorities and values right so that we pick the right battles which truly matter in making our lives count for something. If we start giving a f*ck about every little thing, we will end up spending too much energy on trivial matters and being generally uncontented about life. While it is fine not to feel positive all the time, learning how to channel that in the right direction and taking charge of your life where it is possible to make a difference are the essential messages the book is getting across to the reader. The one theme that was discussed which I feel very strongly about was concerning the 'sense of entitlement' and how this can be destructive in the way one views his or her life. And social media is probably the biggest culprit in propagating this negative view to a whole new level. Being constantly bombarded with reality shows, Instagrams and blogs of beautiful people enjoying a beautiful life, we start to ask ""Why can't I be like so-and-so?"" or ""Why can't I have this or that too?"". As a 14-year old niece of mine rightly pointed out, Instagram represents filtered existence. It seems almost natural now for most to block out the unfavourable or darker segments of life or humanity - such as poverty, hunger, war, violence, human trafficking, prostitution, etc. Instead, we moan and groan about the 'unfortunate circumstances' of not being able to own nice cars and big houses, have great clothes and the requisite body to go with it, go on expensive holidays, or obtain that 'much-deserved' promotion at work - the list goes on and on.Anyway, I'm rambling - this is a topic that I can go on and on about, but that's not the point about this review. If you're curious, this is worth a read as it is quite funny and does not take up much time to finish. Even though much of what is said was nothing new, sometimes we just need that extra nudge.This review can also be found at Booknest"
249,0062457713,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5759543-sam-quixote,3,"Eye-catching title, eh? Unfortunately that’s about all that really stands out about Mark Manson’s The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck, which is actually a very ordinary self-help book - and I’ve not even read a lot of self-help books either, that’s how broad, generic and unremarkable a lot of the stuff he talks about here is! Still, its ideas are ultimately positive and worth re-reading and keeping in mind so I can’t say I found the book a total waste of time. The book’s title and main thesis can be summed up as: finding and caring about the shit that matters to you while ignoring the shit that doesn’t - see what I mean when I say it’s unremarkable? But wait, there’s more! Manson has more vapid platitudes like how life’s about the journey, not the destination, how finding meaning in life is better than accumulating material possessions, and that, seeing as we’re all going to die one day, why waste our limited time on shit that doesn’t matter? Not that I disagree with any of that but there’s nothing new or special about that information and you definitely don’t need to read this book to hear that kind of stuff. In fact, you don’t even need to read it anywhere at all as these ideas are so ubiquitous in pop culture as to be cliched! But, like I said, the book also contains useful messages that are worth hearing whether or not you’ve come across them before. Messages like pain and struggle are necessary and unavoidable parts of life. That rising up to challenges and facing hard truths about ourselves help us grow as well as make us stronger at weathering the shit life inevitably throws our way. That failure - so long as we learn from it - eventually leads to success so we shouldn’t be afraid to keep trying even if we’ll probably fail. That dissatisfaction and being uncomfortable are good as they motivate us to change and improve ourselves and our circumstances. I agree that perspective and values are important and that adjusting these can lead to a more satisfying existence. This means accepting that you’ll probably never be rich and famous, that you’re probably not an undiscovered genius or great artist, or that anything you’ll ever do will have any lasting impact on future generations. And that realisation can be freeing to pursue the things that only matter to you.As Manson notes, nothing is certain, which is a profoundly obvious yet difficult lesson I’m slowly learning and re-learning all the time. We also have a tendency to create our own narratives that are confining and are worth exploding as they’re largely bullshit. And I totally agree with and can personally attest that taking more responsibility in your life leads to far greater happiness. Jocko Willink has a similar philosophy: Discipline Equals Freedom. But I don’t buy Manson’s anecdote that when he googled the quote “With great power comes great responsibility” he couldn’t find out who originally said it. As a comics reader, I instantly know it was Spider-Man’s Uncle Ben but I can’t believe a Google search wouldn’t tell him that! He’s right though when he says that excessive freedoms don’t lead to happiness. You only need to look at the toxic Social Justice movement currently poisoning Western politics whose adherents are obsessed with personal freedoms - none of those people are ever happy! His points on the importance of boundaries in relationships and healthy conflict stemming from honesty though were banal and unnecessary. I’m a terrible procrastinator so I really liked the “Do Something” principle where you just do whatever it is you should be doing rather than waiting for the “right moment” or inspiration to strike. The idea is that once you start doing something, especially badly, you’ll eventually start doing it right. Action leads to motivation leads to inspiration leads to success - basically a practical application of not being afraid of failure and one I’ll be trying out myself. I wasn’t that interested in Manson’s autobiographical anecdotes, which were mostly mundane, nor did I find a lot of the examples he chose to illustrate his ideas to be that compelling, though I do like the possibility that Shakespeare wrote Romeo & Juliet as a satire on love especially as so many view it as the ultimate romance story! I also don’t agree that caring less about something means you’ll do better at it or that great people become great because they don’t think they’re great which is why they work harder than most. Both are, like a lot of the statements he makes, an oversimplified generalisation. Maybe he’s right for some but maybe some others already think they’re great and are driven by something else? And, like all self-help books, it needs to be vague enough to be a one-size fits all for the widest possible appeal so I’m not sure how helpful it’s going to be in finding its audience’s meaning in their individual lives - it certainly didn’t mine! But on the whole Manson is a decent writer who’s able to put his ideas across quite clearly in an accessible way. The messaging may be fairly commonplace and underwhelming but I found enough good stuff here to have gotten something out of reading it and if you’ve read no self-help books at all you might find this even more useful! The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck is kinda worth giving a fuck about, just don’t expect much from it. "

So I haven't read this book yet, but here's a short play about one of the most ridiculous encounters regarding this book.Hesitant Customer (without children - this is important): ""Could I please see the Subtle Art of not Giving a....""Jen: ""Fuck?""Indignant Customer: ""Yes.""The customer flips through the book. Her lip curls at the sight of ""shit"" and her eyebrows furrow at every ""fuck"" thrown by Mark Manson.Condescending Customer: ""Is there a version of this book without cursing? I feel that it is unnecessary...""Jen's jaw drops: That would defeat the purpose of -Awesome colleague grabs an empty journal: Here we go. The purpose of the book is to stop worrying about bullshit and fuckery that you worry about in life. If you're worried about the word ""fuck"", you need this book more than anyone else.

251,0062457713,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3643764-esil,4,"3.5 starsI’m not sure what possessed me to listen to this audiobook. I have ZERO interest in self help books. But once I started, I thought it was good enough to keep going.The title is there for shock value, but it’s not a particularly shocking book, unless you’re easily put off by swearing. The author is not really advocating that we all drop everything and run to the beach. He’s arguing for recalibrating what matters to you, and acting on it.The secondary title - “a counterintuitive approach to living a good life” - is deceptive. There’s nothing counterintuitive here. There’s a lot of common sense. But it’s pretty good common sense. And also timely in many ways. So I didn’t have any aha moments, but I nodded my head a fair bit.The question that kept buzzing at the back of my mind is how likely people are to be able to make dramatic changes in their lives by being told to shift the focus on what matters to them. In other words, easier said than done. But still worth thinking about every now and then.I think I’ll stick to my ZERO self help books policy, but this wasn’t a bad foray out of my usual comfort zones."
252,0062457713,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22371819-mariah-roze,4,This was a great book! I've been seeing it everywhere so I wanted to read it. This book was great at reminding you that you shouldn't care what other people think. It is important to do what you want and what your heart wants. It also reminds you that you don't need to be famous or have a spectacular life to have a great life. This is YOUR life. Do what YOU want!
253,0062457713,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45341691-israt-zaman-disha,4,"""The desire for more positive experience is itself a negative experience. And, paradoxically, the acceptance of one’s negative experience is itself a positive experience.""I never thought of reading this book. Saw a hype about it recently in a group on facebook. So I just wanted to know what this book is about. After reading the blurb on goodreads, I thought to give it a go, see what's the hype about. So I started listening to the audiobook. ""Not giving a fuck does not mean being indifferent; it means being comfortable with being different.""First thing I learned from this book is, never judge a book by its cover or title or first chapter. In the first chapter, the author said f*ck like a 100 times. I think there was no need to said that word this many times. I don't have any problem with saying fuck. But when I read/listen to fuck this many times in just one chapter, I cannot help but feel irritated. So yeah, I was irritated but decided to go on. And I am glad of my decision. ""Maturity is what happens when one learns to only give a fuck about what’s truly fuckworthy.""I don't think this book is an inspiring one. The writer didn't want to tell people how to be motivated or how to be a successful person. He simply told how to be happy in life. What is the mantra behind peace and happiness in one's life. And I have to say I totally agree. And that mantra is not giving a fuck. Well, now some may think that not giving a fuck means being indifferent to everything. But that's not true. There's a very thin line between being indifferent and being indifferent to the things that are not important in life. Mark Manson talked about this difference and how we care about everything. In this book, he shared many of his thoughts about happiness, emotion, sufferings, values, responsibilities, rejections, and relations of our life. And I agree with most of the things he said. You can say I am bragging but I found that my thoughts and ideas about life are a lot like Mark Manson. And yes I was lame and pathetic once. But I am growing. I am learning the subtle art of not giving a fuck. ""Being wrong opens us up to the possibility of change. Being wrong brings the opportunity for growth.""One thing I love while reading something is when I find some character I can relate to real life. And this book was full of it. Sometimes I find someone who is exactly like my friend, then someone pretty much like my boss and finally someone a lot like me. It was a major point why I liked this book. ""There is a simple realization from which all personal improvement and growth emerge. This is the realization that we, individually, are responsible for everything in our lives, no matter the external circumstances. We don’t always control what happens to us. But we always control how we interpret what happens to us, as well as how we respond. Whether we consciously recognize it or not, we are always responsible for our experiences.""There's one thing that I didn't understand the last chapter. And I was thinking of giving a star less for it. Then I thought maybe I haven't grown that much yet. So yeah I will reread the last chapter after two or three years and see if it makes any sense. So 5 stars for now... :D ""To be happy we need something to solve. Happiness is, therefore, a form of action..."""
254,0062457713,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38414168-ashish-iyer,2,"It starts off really well but then starts to drag out. The things mentioned in the book are logical and make immense sense, they're also presented with interesting and sometimes personal issues to get the idea. Manson's writing is straight to the point and natural; it flows like a conversation rather than a self-help rant. All this, and I still couldn't find much enthusiasm for the things being said because I find them to be basic things that I've always believed. It did give me a few things to consider and maybe look up, but I don't get why people keep telling me that it's ""life changing."""

It’s less about not giving a fuck and more about what is worth giving a fuck about. And there are things that are worth giving a fuck about! In fact, Manson tells us that having problems is a good thing… only it’s important that we fill our lives mostly with problems that we want to have. Sound confusing? Read the book. He’ll also hit it home that life isn’t fair or easy, and it’s not supposed to be. In fact, if it was you’d be bored to death and would be way less happy than you think you’d be.— Wallace Yovetichfrom The Best Books We Read In January 2017: http://bookriot.com/2017/02/01/riot-r...

I even highlighted tons of favorite quotes from this book, whenever I feel anxious, stressed, or depressed I read those quote and trust me it really ease my mind.“Who you are is defined by what you’re willing to struggle for.” The funny thing is I had no expectation from this book, I just decided to read it because I've seen many people were talking about this book. I am not much into self-help books. When I started to read this book, I knew immediately I would love it. This book doesn't sugarcoat anything. It's blunt, true, and makes you realize not to waste your emotional energy. You should know when and where you should give a fuck and when or where you shouldn't.

They're usually written by preachy, entitled people who believe they've ""made it"" telling you what to do and how to think, as if you're a brainless amoeba lapping up their greatness. This book is no different. Filled mainly with questionable anecdotes and retellings of things we already know, I kept on reading for some actual substance.

So, lots of advice that most of us probably already know, but will still likely leave you feeling motivated."
259,0062457713,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62428250-karina,4,"First off, I am not much of a self-help reader: not because I think I am perfect and have nothing to learn about myself but because it usually feels like it's a know-it-all slimy salesman telling me what is ""wrong"" with the person I am. BUT Mark Manson had a wonderful approach to his book. He is just a normal person without all that Botox and designer jeans that made his butt look bigger telling me he has many things HE has to work on a daily basis and what he had to overcome to not be a piece of shit psycho. I had to return the book to its rightful owner so I can't pick out my favorite quotes (and I'm not buying it for $30) but this book is very quotable and very raw.I have always known I am a people pleaser and I really hate that trait about me because I put myself in awkward positions and then resent the person I want to help because 1. They weren't grateful enough 2. They will never ever return the favor 3. They turned out to be shitty people. 4. I am just annoyed!So yes, it okay to say NO to people. I don't have to care about every little cause and I should definitely have my priorities straight. Stop being fake and surround yourself with people that are meaningful to you. Just do and see what happens from there. You are not unique and your problems are not unique so once you realize this you can just live your life without that carrot dangling over your sleep. With failure you learn about who you are and can grow as a person. Just because you failed at something doesn't mean you are a failure. Social media life is fake so you are not pathetic for not eating at Spago for lunch or being in the Caribbean this year. Be true to the person you want to be. There was more to it and Manson had some great stories in there. My Negatives- He said ""Fuck"" wwwaaayyy too much. I get it. That's the damn title of the book.Sometimes got repetitive.Overall- recommend."

I wouldn’t normally reach for a self help book, but Mark Moran’s The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck: A Counterintuitive Approach to Living a Good Life, was the pick for our book club this month. It also formed part of challenge read on 'read a self help guide' I have going with a fellow bookworm. I decided to give this book a chance and I went into reading it with an open mind, despite my reservations about the bold title. I surprised myself by enjoying this book. I found it a highly readable, direct, humorous and relatable guide. I wouldn’t say this is a self help book as such, but more a strategy in self evaluation. Many of the ideas and approaches Moran suggests we should take to change our lives are simple to implement and most probably have in the back of our minds – yet Moran suggest what we lack is courage to act on this. What Moran does is put these ideas in spotlight and his book works to give the reader the encouragement needed to put his notions into practice. What I appreciated the most about The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck was insertion of real life stories within this text. Moran linked his approaches to concrete scenarios, which gave his guide much more brevity. From the author Moran’s own back story from hitting rock bottom to becoming a blogger extraordinaire, to celebrity examples such as former Beatles drummer Pete Best and even World War II survivours - the message is clear in all cases.

For me, I am the Anti-Self-Development type, however, sometimes I give a book or two a chance to make a difference and change my mind. And that truly rarely or never happens. I am one of those whom are fed up with all those toxic self-development books. That type of books like: How to achieve greatness, How to win and influence people, how to be rich, etc, etc. This book is completely as it states the ""Counterintuitive approach to Living a Good Life"", the, as I'd love to put it, ""Anti-Self development book of really good life"". So whatever reader are you, this book is for you!""The Subtle Art of Not Giving A F*ck""The moment you read the title you think: ""Really! Could this even be a title?!""A title that will either scare you out to give it a try, or will burn your eagerness to know what it is all about. To be honest, I am freaked out to write a review about this book. I finished the book a day earlier but had no guts to start on writing a review. But as I recently feel obliged to write a review about every single book that I read, thus it seemed inevitable to write it sooner or later. So here we go. Fasten your seat belt!If you have ever heard of Charles Bukowski, Buddha, Hiroo Onoda, Norio Suzuki, Dave Mustaine, Pete Best, William James, Malala Yousafzai, Meredith Maran, Pablo Picasso, Romeo & Juliet, Ernest Becker, then trust me, you will learn their stories again in a very different way that will seize your mind and leave you completely astonished.This book will help you know why all the other self-development books didn't help you or anyone else through the principle of the Feedback Loop from Hell.It will tell you why we are always searching for the happiness and what should the true happiness be from everyone's own perspective.Moreover it will accuse you, and me, of overrating certain life aspects. You will also get to meet the Disappointment Panda and figure out how would you deal with him.You will learn by yourself how everyone is given to choose their own struggles.You will know that it is not a must to me the superhero and the very special person in that exaggerating behavior, in a matter of fact, thus everyone should be one! Nevertheless not lowering or diminishing the value of being one!It will tear you apart while knowing the value of suffering, the shitty values and great values through The Self-Awarness Onion.Furthermore, it will condemn you of your responsibilities and all the freedom of choice you have. It will hit you on the head by letting you ask yourself: ""What if I am wrong about everything?"" Last but not least, It will grab you by the arm to know that failure, pain and rejection are part of the process by getting to know the Do Something principle.
This book is about everything in your life. It isn't limited to career topics or relationship styling. But rather to a higher and more intellectual state of mind and reason. This book is for you!This book is not rocket science, it doesn't inform us of new matters that were unknown to us. Rather it tells you exactly what you already know, what is standing right in front of your nose, down in simple, friendly, invasive words that will leave you seeing things much more different than before.I have made it across a lot of various books, but this book is surely different. I believe this book was the hit on the head that I urgely needed to wake up and sort things out differently and to view all my priorities and values with an entirely conscious mind. And to put all my life, past and future, into question!This book will drive you to get hurt facing the inevitable truth, will make you show up your deepest wounds, will leave you in anger, rage and tears depending on what you have encountered in life and the VALUES you are living by.P.S. If you are rigid follower of my reviews you will understand why I underlined the word VALUES and why this book is a so life changing experience to me. As I hope it would be to you too."

I think it's an attempt to piggyback on the success of Marie Kondo's book by being ""inspired"" by the title and hoping people will pay money without looking too hard at the contents of the book."
263,0062457713,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67160575-sara,5,"I am amazed by this book and everything that was in it! Mark Manson really speaks the truth and talks about important issues that are part of our lives. But it takes time, effort and great amount of work on yourself to get to that state of mind he's talking about. We easily fall into routine and complain about it, but not everyone is willing to break the cycle. I think I need to read this book every year.„Don’t just sit there. Do something.

Finally the author tried to make a case that those involved in grief had a choice on how to deal with it citing a parent dealing with child loss and totally lost me At no point in your rambling, incoherent response were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought. Everyone in this room is now dumber for having listened to it. I award you no points Mr Manson, and may God have mercy on your soul."
265,0062457713,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31777090-sohaib,4,"This book is about setting and honing personal values. It's about determining what to give a fuck about in your life. In Manson's witty words, managing the amount of fucks you give. Minimizing the scope of your interests really—to the essentials. Putting all of your eggs in that one basket. Figuring out what that basket is in the first place. Does that make sense?I enjoyed a couple of ideas. One of them is on the importance of cultivating doubt. Manson claims that uncertainty is the way forward and that the key to personal growth lies in being comfortable with it. The comfort breeds an openness that obliterates sticking to rigid values and motivates us towards positive change. Uncertainty breaks the entitlement chain, the belief that you're a special snowflake who deserves special treatment from the world—the naivety of expecting something for nothing, to be loved for doing nothing, to be appreciated for doing nothing, and so on. To break the hold of the spell of certainty and entitlement, Mr. Manson proposes asking yourself three golden questions:1- What if I'm wrong? 2- What would it mean if I'm wrong? 3- Would me being wrong create better problems? I tried them for size and trust me, the sheer entertaining of the possibility of being wrong is refreshing. Also wonderful in cultivating compassion, humility, and acceptance of oneself and others. The success formula Manson proposes goes something like this:Happiness comes from solving problems, and the quality of your problems is determined by the quality of your values and metrics, the standards by which you measure your success. Naturally, the better the problems, the more successful you are. Good problems come from having good values and metrics. And so Manson dedicates more than half of his book to what he sees as the five most important values, and he summarizes them on page 89 in one paragraph:""The first ... is a radical form of responsibility: taking responsibility for everything that occurs in your life, regardless of who's at fault. The second is uncertainty: the acknowledgment of your own ignorance and the cultivation of constant doubt in your own beliefs. The next is failure ... The fourth is rejection: the ability to both say and hear no ... The final value is the contemplation of one's own mortality.""Another idea that stuck is the Do Something Principle, the idea that action can and sometimes should precede motivation. This reminded me of Ralph Waldo Emerson's famous quote: ""Do the thing and you shall have the power."" Most of us, unfortunately, spend our entire lives waiting for that power to come down, waiting for the muse instead of moving in the direction of our dreams. Action > Inspiration > Motivation > Action... (Loop) In the end, The Subtle Art is a sobering unconventional take on self-help, and I recommend it for people looking for just that. Three stars and a half, with a grain of salt. My rating came down from four and a half thanks to me cultivating doubt about this book. So here goes that Mr. Manson."

""Everything worthwhile in life is won through surmounting the associated negative experience. Any attempt to escape the negative, to avoid it or quash it or silence it, only backfires. The avoidance of suffering is a form of suffering. The avoidance of struggle is a struggle. The denial of failure is a failure. Hiding what is shameful is itself a form of shame.Pain is an inextricable thread in the fabric of life, and to tear it out is not only impossible, but destructive: attempting to tear it out unravels everything else with it. To try to avoid pain is to give too many fucks about pain. In contrast, if you’re able to not give a fuck about the pain, you become unstoppable.""
I can't explain how much i love this book. It was even more fun listening to it than reading it. Plus, it's a very short listen; about 6 hours if I remember correctly. It starts off pretty light-hearted and funny with some good points. Then it gets pretty heavy by the end. The last 2 chapter were probably my favorite. It's not a book about giving no fucks at all, only psychopaths and liars don't care about anything, but more so about figuring out what is worthy of the fucks you'll give. Whether you think you give too many fucks or aren't sure what to give a fuck about, read this book. At the very least it's worth using one of your audible credits on. "
267,0062457713,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6168938-zoe,3,Nothing illuminating in this book but it is VERY funny. What the writer wrote about is something we know but often forget. So it was a good reminder for us to focus on the important things. 
268,0062457713,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18989854-krystal,4,"First up, the title is clearly more for shock factor than an accurate title for this book since f*cks are still given, albeit selectively.Second, if bad language, crass stories and vulgar honesty offend you, this may not be an appropriate choice of reading material.Thirdly, these are not particularly new concepts. For alternative reads without the swearing and vulgarity, I'd recommend Daring Greatly: How the Courage to Be Vulnerable Transforms the Way We Live, Love, Parent, and Lead (my 5 star review here) and/or The Courage to be Disliked (my 4 star review here) I'm not a huge fan of swearing etc. myself but this was more about bluntness and simplicity rather than swearing for the sake of it so I didn't mind it quite so much. It's just honest and raw and is quite serious about making its point that no one and nothing is perfect.The point of this book is not to stop 'giving a f*ck', but to choose wisely the things you decide to care about. It raises the fairly common notion that true happiness is beyond the material, and caring about things you can't change (such as others' feelings) will do more harm than good. These ideas are something I definitely connect with, and I do think it's important to take responsibility for your own happiness. Yes, sometimes sh*tty things happen, but you have to find a way through the sh*t to ultimately become stronger, otherwise you're giving up happiness in favour of being a victim.The delivery is certainly not for everyone as there's no sympathy here, and the apathetic will be disappointed because instead of finding a common ideal this book hits with some hard truths. People who are offended easily will find plenty to be offended about, and it's easy to criticise the author for his sexist examples and analogies and the despicable behaviour of his past (which we only know because he has chosen to share). It starts with the message, 'don't try' and concludes with '...and then you die' and in between is a whole lot of 'you are not special', which honestly all sounds quite depressing but it really does make a lot of sense. It tells us we are not special, but then goes on to suggest why that might be so painful to hear. If you are open-minded, you'll understand and perhaps appreciate the wisdom in it; if you're more stubborn you'll close your eyes, cover your ears and repeat to yourself that you are special, no matter what this crappy little book says (thus increasing the pressure on yourself to be special). All in all, the book makes a lot of sense, but you have to be open and accepting enough to appreciate it.Side note: I was really surprised there were no references listed, considering how many names were dropped and psychology experiments referenced etc. Curious.If this rubbed you up the wrong way I'd definitely suggest giving Daring Greatly a chance, as it's a much more comprehensive (and kind) exploration of the same themes.This was book 24 in my #Dymocks52challenge refined.

The book is a reaction to the self-help industry and what Manson saw as a culture of mindless positivity that isn't practical or helpful for most people. Manson uses many of his own personal experiences to illustrate how life's struggles often give it more meaning, which, he argues, is a better approach than constantly trying to be happy. Manson's approach and writing style have been categorized by some as contrarian to the general self-help industry, using blunt honesty and profanity to illustrate his ideas.The book has 9 chapters with the following titles:1. Don't Try.2. Happiness is a problem.3. You are not special.4. The value of suffering.5. You are always choosing.6. You are wrong about everything (But so am I).7. Failure is the way forward.8.

So I agree that action can bring about inspiration which can lead to motivation. "

This book offers a is a zero-nonsense approach to self-help concepts. I’ve heard most of it before but the author delivers the message in a concise, sorry-if-it-hurts, straight-forward way.I found some of the advice helpful and I’m glad I read it. I understand now why it might resonate with many people and recommend it to those always seeking to improve themselves."

Instead I got a collection of banal insights, wrapped in supposedly funny dirty-talk. References to philosophy/literature were reminiscent of an author who just skimmed through ""100 ideas in X you need to know"" and didn't bother further. They were forced and off-beat especially considering the overall tone, which itself fluctuated between the earnestness of self-help drivel and the tongue-in-cheek of comedy memoirs. Ironically, this was the only convincing argument made to support the point on making choices to narrow down your options. Looks like the author didn’t even follow his own advice."

But I've seen this one floating around and it's been getting some great reviews so I got curious and decided to check this one out. I listened to the audiobook and was able to get through it in a few days. Now I know why I don't read self help books. I don't know why but it comes across as so pretentious to me, and hearing Mark Manson ramble on for so long about ""not giving a fuck"" and ""only giving a fuck about the things that matter"" it just felt to me like he was trying too hard. Also, he's a privileged white man and some of this felt very douche-y to me. Like him talking about how he tells his wife when she doesn't look good because honesty is more important... like okay. I just didn't enjoy this the way I thought I might. I don't think self help books are for me. "

Book has no originality and better writers have written more brilliantly about these topics. Entire thing boils down to irritating, naive, amateur psychology from a douchebag in serious ignorance of his douchebaggery. The book suffers from the problem of extremes. In this case, in attempting to correct for admittedly nauseating over positivity bullshit, the author is now guilty of the same crap in the opposite direction - an over glorification of suffering. This is just as much of a crap fest as what he claims to be avoiding. Laughable part is that dude is an entitled little shithead who's got no understanding of suffering. There's even more considerable lack of understanding of medical/scientific research and on some level he seems to believe that people with real psychological issues should just get over themselves cause everyone has problems. When a human being gets to a point where he can equate his self imposed drugged infused decade of ""trauma"" stemming from his parents divorce to the real trauma of a father losing his son, that's serious entitled bullshit! To conclude that someone who has suffered through hellish circumstances can just move on based on cherry picked examples of celebrities making it, is pathetically superficial. This kind of crappy thinking is what results in selfish individuals who can only empathize with others if they have gone through similar experiences themselves. Books like this don't move the dial in improving humanity, they just create/justify narcissistic characters who hide their narcissism behind a wall of false self improvement. This author is no different from the cultish positivity people he scorns. He spews the same sanctimonious, bullshit rhetoric where he pats himself on the back by stating how his values help make the world better! His whole unoriginal theory of put on your big boy panties and get over yourself mentality is just as terrible as the whole disappear into some zen bullshit crapfest. It's this kind of mentality that makes people say if I could make it, I don't get why anyone else can't either. It fails to recognize differences in circumstances. I'm all for suck it up and deal with life but the ability to fail to recognize that maybe the dad with the dead kid has suffered more pain than the asshole with the cheating ex girlfriend is ludicrous! What this guy has done is surround himself with folks so obviously dysfunctional, he ends up looking like the king in a world of spectacular ignorance. The question that should be asked as he gives multiple examples of his idiotic friends being assholes, is how has he managed to collect so many terrible people in his circle? What does this say about his values and judgement? In the end, author is no different from his douchebag ""friend"" he described in the earlier chapters except unlike the friend who limited himself to sponging off of relatives, this dude has expanded his narcissistic reach to a wider audience. Still playing the victim of the trauma of his parents divorce, still standing for nothing except the right to say what he wants, when he wants to whoever he wants. There's a word for people like that - douchebag! "
277,0062457713,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16131467-nate-icart,1,"I absolutely hated this book. Reasons why:-The author's jokes were terrible. His style of humor is just to add a random number to an example (""I felt like I was punched 253 times in the stomach""). -Many (most) of the concepts in this book are ripped from common bodies of knowledge (he explains the basic economic concept of opportunity cost like he was the one who discovered it)-His experiences all feel fake. He talks about how came to deep realizations about his life when we was a fresh college graduate -- not that this is impossible, just very unlikely.-The first few chapters have the word ""Fuck"" in them so much that it just feels like he's making excuses to say it. I like swearing, but every time he talks about sex he calls it ""fucking"". No one talks like that.-It's very hard to take a 32 year old self-help guru seriously when they don't have a real life like the rest of us. He's been a world-traveler and an extremely popular blogger for years. He explained that he only held a ""real"" job for 6 weeks post-graduation. Who can relate to this?-The best part about this book is the cover. Manson is good at marketing, and he's good in short-form (like on his blog), but I will never read another book that he writes."

However, the title of this book piqued my curiosity and it perpetually appears on the main page of Audible as a best seller, thus furthering my interest to pick it up. As an audiobook, I did enjoy this quite a fair bit as the narrator was good and brought life to the narrative. Admittedly, the advice contained herein was not ground-breaking, but delivered in a refreshing and humourous manner. It served as a reminder as to what we probably already know in the deep, dark recesses of our minds, but are too caught up in the hectic modern life and excesses for greater inner reflection. I find a few of the real-life examples quoted to be quite relevant and effective.

Who you are is defined by what you're willing to struggle for.

The title is slightly misleading as the book is not so much as to how not to give a f*ck but to choose what is important enough to give a f*ck about. It is about getting our priorities and values right so that we pick the right battles which truly matter in making our lives count for something. If we start giving a f*ck about every little thing, we will end up spending too much energy on trivial matters and being generally uncontented about life. While it is fine not to feel positive all the time, learning how to channel that in the right direction and taking charge of your life where it is possible to make a difference are the essential messages the book is getting across to the reader. The one theme that was discussed which I feel very strongly about was concerning the 'sense of entitlement' and how this can be destructive in the way one views his or her life. And social media is probably the biggest culprit in propagating this negative view to a whole new level. Being constantly bombarded with reality shows, Instagrams and blogs of beautiful people enjoying a beautiful life, we start to ask ""Why can't I be like so-and-so?"" or ""Why can't I have this or that too?"". As a 14-year old niece of mine rightly pointed out, Instagram represents filtered existence. It seems almost natural now for most to block out the unfavourable or darker segments of life or humanity - such as poverty, hunger, war, violence, human trafficking, prostitution, etc. Instead, we moan and groan about the 'unfortunate circumstances' of not being able to own nice cars and big houses, have great clothes and the requisite body to go with it, go on expensive holidays, or obtain that 'much-deserved' promotion at work - the list goes on and on.Anyway, I'm rambling - this is a topic that I can go on and on about, but that's not the point about this review. If you're curious, this is worth a read as it is quite funny and does not take up much time to finish. Even though much of what is said was nothing new, sometimes we just need that extra nudge.This review can also be found at Booknest"
279,0062457713,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5759543-sam-quixote,3,"Eye-catching title, eh? Unfortunately that’s about all that really stands out about Mark Manson’s The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck, which is actually a very ordinary self-help book - and I’ve not even read a lot of self-help books either, that’s how broad, generic and unremarkable a lot of the stuff he talks about here is! Still, its ideas are ultimately positive and worth re-reading and keeping in mind so I can’t say I found the book a total waste of time. The book’s title and main thesis can be summed up as: finding and caring about the shit that matters to you while ignoring the shit that doesn’t - see what I mean when I say it’s unremarkable? But wait, there’s more! Manson has more vapid platitudes like how life’s about the journey, not the destination, how finding meaning in life is better than accumulating material possessions, and that, seeing as we’re all going to die one day, why waste our limited time on shit that doesn’t matter? Not that I disagree with any of that but there’s nothing new or special about that information and you definitely don’t need to read this book to hear that kind of stuff. In fact, you don’t even need to read it anywhere at all as these ideas are so ubiquitous in pop culture as to be cliched! But, like I said, the book also contains useful messages that are worth hearing whether or not you’ve come across them before. Messages like pain and struggle are necessary and unavoidable parts of life. That rising up to challenges and facing hard truths about ourselves help us grow as well as make us stronger at weathering the shit life inevitably throws our way. That failure - so long as we learn from it - eventually leads to success so we shouldn’t be afraid to keep trying even if we’ll probably fail. That dissatisfaction and being uncomfortable are good as they motivate us to change and improve ourselves and our circumstances. I agree that perspective and values are important and that adjusting these can lead to a more satisfying existence. This means accepting that you’ll probably never be rich and famous, that you’re probably not an undiscovered genius or great artist, or that anything you’ll ever do will have any lasting impact on future generations. And that realisation can be freeing to pursue the things that only matter to you.As Manson notes, nothing is certain, which is a profoundly obvious yet difficult lesson I’m slowly learning and re-learning all the time. We also have a tendency to create our own narratives that are confining and are worth exploding as they’re largely bullshit. And I totally agree with and can personally attest that taking more responsibility in your life leads to far greater happiness. Jocko Willink has a similar philosophy: Discipline Equals Freedom. But I don’t buy Manson’s anecdote that when he googled the quote “With great power comes great responsibility” he couldn’t find out who originally said it. As a comics reader, I instantly know it was Spider-Man’s Uncle Ben but I can’t believe a Google search wouldn’t tell him that! He’s right though when he says that excessive freedoms don’t lead to happiness. You only need to look at the toxic Social Justice movement currently poisoning Western politics whose adherents are obsessed with personal freedoms - none of those people are ever happy! His points on the importance of boundaries in relationships and healthy conflict stemming from honesty though were banal and unnecessary. I’m a terrible procrastinator so I really liked the “Do Something” principle where you just do whatever it is you should be doing rather than waiting for the “right moment” or inspiration to strike. The idea is that once you start doing something, especially badly, you’ll eventually start doing it right. Action leads to motivation leads to inspiration leads to success - basically a practical application of not being afraid of failure and one I’ll be trying out myself. I wasn’t that interested in Manson’s autobiographical anecdotes, which were mostly mundane, nor did I find a lot of the examples he chose to illustrate his ideas to be that compelling, though I do like the possibility that Shakespeare wrote Romeo & Juliet as a satire on love especially as so many view it as the ultimate romance story! I also don’t agree that caring less about something means you’ll do better at it or that great people become great because they don’t think they’re great which is why they work harder than most. Both are, like a lot of the statements he makes, an oversimplified generalisation. Maybe he’s right for some but maybe some others already think they’re great and are driven by something else? And, like all self-help books, it needs to be vague enough to be a one-size fits all for the widest possible appeal so I’m not sure how helpful it’s going to be in finding its audience’s meaning in their individual lives - it certainly didn’t mine! But on the whole Manson is a decent writer who’s able to put his ideas across quite clearly in an accessible way. The messaging may be fairly commonplace and underwhelming but I found enough good stuff here to have gotten something out of reading it and if you’ve read no self-help books at all you might find this even more useful! The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck is kinda worth giving a fuck about, just don’t expect much from it. "

Her lip curls at the sight of ""shit"" and her eyebrows furrow at every ""fuck"" thrown by Mark Manson.Condescending Customer: ""Is there a version of this book without cursing? I feel that it is unnecessary...""Jen's jaw drops: That would defeat the purpose of -Awesome colleague grabs an empty journal: Here we go. The purpose of the book is to stop worrying about bullshit and fuckery that you worry about in life. If you're worried about the word ""fuck"", you need this book more than anyone else.

281,0062457713,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3643764-esil,4,"3.5 starsI’m not sure what possessed me to listen to this audiobook. I have ZERO interest in self help books. But once I started, I thought it was good enough to keep going.The title is there for shock value, but it’s not a particularly shocking book, unless you’re easily put off by swearing. The author is not really advocating that we all drop everything and run to the beach. He’s arguing for recalibrating what matters to you, and acting on it.The secondary title - “a counterintuitive approach to living a good life” - is deceptive. There’s nothing counterintuitive here. There’s a lot of common sense. But it’s pretty good common sense. And also timely in many ways. So I didn’t have any aha moments, but I nodded my head a fair bit.The question that kept buzzing at the back of my mind is how likely people are to be able to make dramatic changes in their lives by being told to shift the focus on what matters to them. In other words, easier said than done. But still worth thinking about every now and then.I think I’ll stick to my ZERO self help books policy, but this wasn’t a bad foray out of my usual comfort zones."
282,0062457713,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22371819-mariah-roze,4,This was a great book! I've been seeing it everywhere so I wanted to read it. This book was great at reminding you that you shouldn't care what other people think. It is important to do what you want and what your heart wants. It also reminds you that you don't need to be famous or have a spectacular life to have a great life. This is YOUR life. Do what YOU want!
283,0062457713,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45341691-israt-zaman-disha,4,"""The desire for more positive experience is itself a negative experience. And, paradoxically, the acceptance of one’s negative experience is itself a positive experience.""I never thought of reading this book. Saw a hype about it recently in a group on facebook. So I just wanted to know what this book is about. After reading the blurb on goodreads, I thought to give it a go, see what's the hype about. So I started listening to the audiobook. ""Not giving a fuck does not mean being indifferent; it means being comfortable with being different.""First thing I learned from this book is, never judge a book by its cover or title or first chapter. In the first chapter, the author said f*ck like a 100 times. I think there was no need to said that word this many times. I don't have any problem with saying fuck. But when I read/listen to fuck this many times in just one chapter, I cannot help but feel irritated. So yeah, I was irritated but decided to go on. And I am glad of my decision. ""Maturity is what happens when one learns to only give a fuck about what’s truly fuckworthy.""I don't think this book is an inspiring one. The writer didn't want to tell people how to be motivated or how to be a successful person. He simply told how to be happy in life. What is the mantra behind peace and happiness in one's life. And I have to say I totally agree. And that mantra is not giving a fuck. Well, now some may think that not giving a fuck means being indifferent to everything. But that's not true. There's a very thin line between being indifferent and being indifferent to the things that are not important in life. Mark Manson talked about this difference and how we care about everything. In this book, he shared many of his thoughts about happiness, emotion, sufferings, values, responsibilities, rejections, and relations of our life. And I agree with most of the things he said. You can say I am bragging but I found that my thoughts and ideas about life are a lot like Mark Manson. And yes I was lame and pathetic once. But I am growing. I am learning the subtle art of not giving a fuck. ""Being wrong opens us up to the possibility of change. Being wrong brings the opportunity for growth.""One thing I love while reading something is when I find some character I can relate to real life. And this book was full of it. Sometimes I find someone who is exactly like my friend, then someone pretty much like my boss and finally someone a lot like me. It was a major point why I liked this book. ""There is a simple realization from which all personal improvement and growth emerge. This is the realization that we, individually, are responsible for everything in our lives, no matter the external circumstances. We don’t always control what happens to us. But we always control how we interpret what happens to us, as well as how we respond. Whether we consciously recognize it or not, we are always responsible for our experiences.""There's one thing that I didn't understand the last chapter. And I was thinking of giving a star less for it. Then I thought maybe I haven't grown that much yet. So yeah I will reread the last chapter after two or three years and see if it makes any sense. So 5 stars for now... :D ""To be happy we need something to solve. Happiness is, therefore, a form of action..."""

The things mentioned in the book are logical and make immense sense, they're also presented with interesting and sometimes personal issues to get the idea. Manson's writing is straight to the point and natural; it flows like a conversation rather than a self-help rant. All this, and I still couldn't find much enthusiasm for the things being said because I find them to be basic things that I've always believed. It did give me a few things to consider and maybe look up, but I don't get why people keep telling me that it's ""life changing."""

It’s less about not giving a fuck and more about what is worth giving a fuck about. And there are things that are worth giving a fuck about! In fact, Manson tells us that having problems is a good thing… only it’s important that we fill our lives mostly with problems that we want to have. Sound confusing? Read the book. He’ll also hit it home that life isn’t fair or easy, and it’s not supposed to be.

I even highlighted tons of favorite quotes from this book, whenever I feel anxious, stressed, or depressed I read those quote and trust me it really ease my mind.“Who you are is defined by what you’re willing to struggle for.” The funny thing is I had no expectation from this book, I just decided to read it because I've seen many people were talking about this book. I am not much into self-help books. When I started to read this book, I knew immediately I would love it. This book doesn't sugarcoat anything. It's blunt, true, and makes you realize not to waste your emotional energy. You should know when and where you should give a fuck and when or where you shouldn't. It will make life a lot different, in a positive way. I would definitely recommend this book."

They're usually written by preachy, entitled people who believe they've ""made it"" telling you what to do and how to think, as if you're a brainless amoeba lapping up their greatness. This book is no different. Filled mainly with questionable anecdotes and retellings of things we already know, I kept on reading for some actual substance. It starts off well enough, but descends into a baseless think piece from the perspective of an entitled white male.

BUT Mark Manson had a wonderful approach to his book. He is just a normal person without all that Botox and designer jeans that made his butt look bigger telling me he has many things HE has to work on a daily basis and what he had to overcome to not be a piece of shit psycho. I had to return the book to its rightful owner so I can't pick out my favorite quotes (and I'm not buying it for $30) but this book is very quotable and very raw.I have always known I am a people pleaser and I really hate that trait about me because I put myself in awkward positions and then resent the person I want to help because 1. They weren't grateful enough 2. They will never ever return the favor 3. They turned out to be shitty people. 4. I am just annoyed!So yes, it okay to say NO to people. I don't have to care about every little cause and I should definitely have my priorities straight. Stop being fake and surround yourself with people that are meaningful to you. Just do and see what happens from there. You are not unique and your problems are not unique so once you realize this you can just live your life without that carrot dangling over your sleep. With failure you learn about who you are and can grow as a person. Just because you failed at something doesn't mean you are a failure. Social media life is fake so you are not pathetic for not eating at Spago for lunch or being in the Caribbean this year. Be true to the person you want to be. There was more to it and Manson had some great stories in there. My Negatives- He said ""Fuck"" wwwaaayyy too much. I get it. That's the damn title of the book.Sometimes got repetitive.Overall- recommend."

I wouldn’t normally reach for a self help book, but Mark Moran’s The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck: A Counterintuitive Approach to Living a Good Life, was the pick for our book club this month. It also formed part of challenge read on 'read a self help guide' I have going with a fellow bookworm. I decided to give this book a chance and I went into reading it with an open mind, despite my reservations about the bold title. I surprised myself by enjoying this book. I found it a highly readable, direct, humorous and relatable guide. I wouldn’t say this is a self help book as such, but more a strategy in self evaluation. Many of the ideas and approaches Moran suggests we should take to change our lives are simple to implement and most probably have in the back of our minds – yet Moran suggest what we lack is courage to act on this. What Moran does is put these ideas in spotlight and his book works to give the reader the encouragement needed to put his notions into practice. What I appreciated the most about The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck was insertion of real life stories within this text. Moran linked his approaches to concrete scenarios, which gave his guide much more brevity. From the author Moran’s own back story from hitting rock bottom to becoming a blogger extraordinaire, to celebrity examples such as former Beatles drummer Pete Best and even World War II survivours - the message is clear in all cases. What almost breaks you may in fact make you a stronger, happier and better person. "

I am one of those whom are fed up with all those toxic self-development books. That type of books like: How to achieve greatness, How to win and influence people, how to be rich, etc, etc. This book is completely as it states the ""Counterintuitive approach to Living a Good Life"", the, as I'd love to put it, ""Anti-Self development book of really good life"". So whatever reader are you, this book is for you!""The Subtle Art of Not Giving A F*ck""The moment you read the title you think: ""Really! Could this even be a title?!""A title that will either scare you out to give it a try, or will burn your eagerness to know what it is all about. To be honest, I am freaked out to write a review about this book. I finished the book a day earlier but had no guts to start on writing a review. But as I recently feel obliged to write a review about every single book that I read, thus it seemed inevitable to write it sooner or later. So here we go. Fasten your seat belt!If you have ever heard of Charles Bukowski, Buddha, Hiroo Onoda, Norio Suzuki, Dave Mustaine, Pete Best, William James, Malala Yousafzai, Meredith Maran, Pablo Picasso, Romeo & Juliet, Ernest Becker, then trust me, you will learn their stories again in a very different way that will seize your mind and leave you completely astonished.This book will help you know why all the other self-development books didn't help you or anyone else through the principle of the Feedback Loop from Hell.It will tell you why we are always searching for the happiness and what should the true happiness be from everyone's own perspective.Moreover it will accuse you, and me, of overrating certain life aspects. You will also get to meet the Disappointment Panda and figure out how would you deal with him.You will learn by yourself how everyone is given to choose their own struggles.You will know that it is not a must to me the superhero and the very special person in that exaggerating behavior, in a matter of fact, thus everyone should be one! Nevertheless not lowering or diminishing the value of being one!It will tear you apart while knowing the value of suffering, the shitty values and great values through The Self-Awarness Onion.Furthermore, it will condemn you of your responsibilities and all the freedom of choice you have. It will hit you on the head by letting you ask yourself: ""What if I am wrong about everything?"" Last but not least, It will grab you by the arm to know that failure, pain and rejection are part of the process by getting to know the Do Something principle.
This book is about everything in your life. It isn't limited to career topics or relationship styling. But rather to a higher and more intellectual state of mind and reason. This book is for you!This book is not rocket science, it doesn't inform us of new matters that were unknown to us. Rather it tells you exactly what you already know, what is standing right in front of your nose, down in simple, friendly, invasive words that will leave you seeing things much more different than before.I have made it across a lot of various books, but this book is surely different. I believe this book was the hit on the head that I urgely needed to wake up and sort things out differently and to view all my priorities and values with an entirely conscious mind. And to put all my life, past and future, into question!This book will drive you to get hurt facing the inevitable truth, will make you show up your deepest wounds, will leave you in anger, rage and tears depending on what you have encountered in life and the VALUES you are living by.P.S.

I think it's an attempt to piggyback on the success of Marie Kondo's book by being ""inspired"" by the title and hoping people will pay money without looking too hard at the contents of the book."

Mark Manson really speaks the truth and talks about important issues that are part of our lives. But it takes time, effort and great amount of work on yourself to get to that state of mind he's talking about. We easily fall into routine and complain about it, but not everyone is willing to break the cycle. I think I need to read this book every year.„Don’t just sit there. Do something.

Everyone in this room is now dumber for having listened to it. I award you no points Mr Manson, and may God have mercy on your soul."
295,0062457713,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31777090-sohaib,4,"This book is about setting and honing personal values. It's about determining what to give a fuck about in your life. In Manson's witty words, managing the amount of fucks you give. Minimizing the scope of your interests really—to the essentials. Putting all of your eggs in that one basket. Figuring out what that basket is in the first place. Does that make sense?I enjoyed a couple of ideas. One of them is on the importance of cultivating doubt. Manson claims that uncertainty is the way forward and that the key to personal growth lies in being comfortable with it. The comfort breeds an openness that obliterates sticking to rigid values and motivates us towards positive change. Uncertainty breaks the entitlement chain, the belief that you're a special snowflake who deserves special treatment from the world—the naivety of expecting something for nothing, to be loved for doing nothing, to be appreciated for doing nothing, and so on. To break the hold of the spell of certainty and entitlement, Mr. Manson proposes asking yourself three golden questions:1- What if I'm wrong? 2- What would it mean if I'm wrong? 3- Would me being wrong create better problems? I tried them for size and trust me, the sheer entertaining of the possibility of being wrong is refreshing. Also wonderful in cultivating compassion, humility, and acceptance of oneself and others. The success formula Manson proposes goes something like this:Happiness comes from solving problems, and the quality of your problems is determined by the quality of your values and metrics, the standards by which you measure your success. Naturally, the better the problems, the more successful you are. Good problems come from having good values and metrics. And so Manson dedicates more than half of his book to what he sees as the five most important values, and he summarizes them on page 89 in one paragraph:""The first ... is a radical form of responsibility: taking responsibility for everything that occurs in your life, regardless of who's at fault. The second is uncertainty: the acknowledgment of your own ignorance and the cultivation of constant doubt in your own beliefs. The next is failure ... The fourth is rejection: the ability to both say and hear no ... The final value is the contemplation of one's own mortality.""Another idea that stuck is the Do Something Principle, the idea that action can and sometimes should precede motivation. This reminded me of Ralph Waldo Emerson's famous quote: ""Do the thing and you shall have the power."" Most of us, unfortunately, spend our entire lives waiting for that power to come down, waiting for the muse instead of moving in the direction of our dreams. Action > Inspiration > Motivation > Action... (Loop) In the end, The Subtle Art is a sobering unconventional take on self-help, and I recommend it for people looking for just that. Three stars and a half, with a grain of salt. My rating came down from four and a half thanks to me cultivating doubt about this book. So here goes that Mr. Manson."

""Everything worthwhile in life is won through surmounting the associated negative experience. Any attempt to escape the negative, to avoid it or quash it or silence it, only backfires. The avoidance of suffering is a form of suffering. The avoidance of struggle is a struggle. The denial of failure is a failure. Hiding what is shameful is itself a form of shame.Pain is an inextricable thread in the fabric of life, and to tear it out is not only impossible, but destructive: attempting to tear it out unravels everything else with it. To try to avoid pain is to give too many fucks about pain. In contrast, if you’re able to not give a fuck about the pain, you become unstoppable.""
I can't explain how much i love this book. It was even more fun listening to it than reading it. Plus, it's a very short listen; about 6 hours if I remember correctly. It starts off pretty light-hearted and funny with some good points. Then it gets pretty heavy by the end. The last 2 chapter were probably my favorite. It's not a book about giving no fucks at all, only psychopaths and liars don't care about anything, but more so about figuring out what is worthy of the fucks you'll give. Whether you think you give too many fucks or aren't sure what to give a fuck about, read this book. At the very least it's worth using one of your audible credits on. "
297,0062457713,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6168938-zoe,3,Nothing illuminating in this book but it is VERY funny. What the writer wrote about is something we know but often forget. So it was a good reminder for us to focus on the important things. 
298,0062457713,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18989854-krystal,4,"First up, the title is clearly more for shock factor than an accurate title for this book since f*cks are still given, albeit selectively.Second, if bad language, crass stories and vulgar honesty offend you, this may not be an appropriate choice of reading material.Thirdly, these are not particularly new concepts. For alternative reads without the swearing and vulgarity, I'd recommend Daring Greatly: How the Courage to Be Vulnerable Transforms the Way We Live, Love, Parent, and Lead (my 5 star review here) and/or The Courage to be Disliked (my 4 star review here) I'm not a huge fan of swearing etc. myself but this was more about bluntness and simplicity rather than swearing for the sake of it so I didn't mind it quite so much. It's just honest and raw and is quite serious about making its point that no one and nothing is perfect.The point of this book is not to stop 'giving a f*ck', but to choose wisely the things you decide to care about. It raises the fairly common notion that true happiness is beyond the material, and caring about things you can't change (such as others' feelings) will do more harm than good. These ideas are something I definitely connect with, and I do think it's important to take responsibility for your own happiness. Yes, sometimes sh*tty things happen, but you have to find a way through the sh*t to ultimately become stronger, otherwise you're giving up happiness in favour of being a victim.The delivery is certainly not for everyone as there's no sympathy here, and the apathetic will be disappointed because instead of finding a common ideal this book hits with some hard truths. People who are offended easily will find plenty to be offended about, and it's easy to criticise the author for his sexist examples and analogies and the despicable behaviour of his past (which we only know because he has chosen to share). It starts with the message, 'don't try' and concludes with '...and then you die' and in between is a whole lot of 'you are not special', which honestly all sounds quite depressing but it really does make a lot of sense. It tells us we are not special, but then goes on to suggest why that might be so painful to hear. If you are open-minded, you'll understand and perhaps appreciate the wisdom in it; if you're more stubborn you'll close your eyes, cover your ears and repeat to yourself that you are special, no matter what this crappy little book says (thus increasing the pressure on yourself to be special). All in all, the book makes a lot of sense, but you have to be open and accepting enough to appreciate it.Side note: I was really surprised there were no references listed, considering how many names were dropped and psychology experiments referenced etc. Curious.If this rubbed you up the wrong way I'd definitely suggest giving Daring Greatly a chance, as it's a much more comprehensive (and kind) exploration of the same themes.This was book 24 in my #Dymocks52challenge refined. You can read more here."
