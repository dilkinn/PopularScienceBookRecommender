Duh. And, 2) Because it's bright fucking orange. That said, the chum was in the water for me already based on that alone. But when I got to this:I knew this book and I would be friends. I am SO anti-participation trophy it's ridiculous. And, no, I don't care if that offends all the middle class helicopter moms and their special snowflakes. Your kid needs to learn how to lose.That's how character is built, my friends.And that's pretty much one of the major points in this book actually.That and, simply put, prioritizing where you put your emotional energy aka your fucks. Stuff I have a solid a handle on already. But, full transparency, I read this out of curiosity and with a slim to none expectation of there being anything life changing to take away from it.Don't get me wrong, color me surprised, I thought this book made a lot of solid points.Some really good, well articulated ones actually. I definitely do think this book has something to offer.For example, it reminded me that I need to stop hoping my sister and I form a BFF Sweet Valley High-esque sister friendship and accept the fact that we are 35+ fucking years old and it's just not gonna happen.And that's okay. She only texts me when she wants or needs something and, while we love and respect each other - we just aren't all THAT. And that's okay. As I said, it made good points - none of which the author attempted to claim creating - he just wrote it down in an easy, witty, sometimes offensive and conversational fashion with examples of his own life and personal epiphanies. It did get a little ridiculous sometimes with how much he referred to his former ""bangs all the ladies"" behavior. We get it, you are a walking dream machine. *eye roll*It also contradicted itself a bit in some areas, though nothing detrimental in my eyes. He also definitely walked a fine line when discussing certain issues as they pertain to women.Feminists and just some women in general will NOT appreciate this book. Not gonna lie though, right or wrong, this book definitely appealed to my snarky, crass kind of humor, reminding me once again that I apparently have the personality and sense of humor of a dude. But whatevers.That's not a fuck I care to give, apparently."

Smile more, love more, hate less, don't give up, it's gonna be okay, it's all in your head. Blah blah blah.... but this one was the exception. Anything with curse words on the cover picks my interest :P The first half of it was my favorite, the aim of this book is to help the reader to think a little bit more clearly about what they’re choosing to find important in life and what they’re choosing to find unimportant.These are few of my favrite quotes in this book:The desire for more positive experience is itself a negative experience. And, paradoxically, the acceptance of one’s negative experience is itself a positive experience.Self-improvement and success often occur together. But that doesn’t necessarily mean they’re the same thing.Our culture today is obsessively focused on unrealistically positive expectations: Be happier. Be healthier. Be the best, better than the rest. Be smarter, faster, richer, sexier, more popular, more productive, more envied, and more admired. Be perfect and amazing and crap out twelve-karat-gold nuggets before breakfast each morning while kissing your selfie-ready spouse and two and a half kids goodbye. Then fly your helicopter to your wonderfully fulfilling job, where you spend your days doing incredibly meaningful work that’s likely to save the planet one day. Ironically, this fixation on the positive—on what’s better, what’s superior—only serves to remind us over and over again of what we are not, of what we lack, of what we should have been but failed to be. After all, no truly happy person feels the need to stand in front of a mirror and recite that she’s happy. She just is.Everyone and their TV commercial wants you to believe that the key to a good life is a nicer job, or a more rugged car, or a prettier girlfriend, or a hot tub with an inflatable pool for the kids. The world is constantly telling you that the path to a better life is more, more, more—buy more, own more, make more, fuck more, be more. You are constantly bombarded with messages to give a fuck about everything, all the time. Give a fuck about a new TV. Give a fuck about having a better vacation than your coworkers. Give a fuck about buying that new lawn ornament. Give a fuck about having the right kind of selfie stick.The Feedback Loop from HellThere’s an insidious quirk to your brain that, if you let it, can drive you absolutely batty. Tell me if this sounds familiar to you: You get anxious about confronting somebody in your life. That anxiety cripples you and you start wondering why you’re so anxious. Now you’re becoming anxious about being anxious. Oh no! Doubly anxious! Now you’re anxious about your anxiety, which is causing more anxiety. Quick, where’s the whiskey?"

In re: false memories and page 128: False memories are absolutely a thing. But when the example you use to illustrate this fact is a 1980's feminist who falsely accused her father of abuse and you follow up with ""in the early 1980s and 1990s hundreds of innocent people were wrongly accused of sexual violence under similar circumstances. Many of them went to prison for it"" you are being supremely irresponsible. The casual reader who is not familiar with sexual violence and rape and abuse could easily walk away with the impression that survivors of sexual assault often make up their assault. This is utterly, utterly untrue - we know that rape and incest are some of the most under reported and under prosecuted crimes, and that the possibility of not being believed plays a big role in that.***Finally finished. One star. You don't need to read this book. "

It still has some good things to say, but it's got so many problems that I don't even want to get into it, I just want to distance myself from it at this point and apologize for recommending it.I would suggest Why Buddhism is True and The Practicing Stoic instead as much better books to read that cover the same ground more in depth, without any of the negatives."

By the time I was halfway in, his smug attitude about things he frankly knows jack shit about were getting on my nerves. He made some excellent points, all of which have been made countless times by other, more competent writers. Read Sartre, Camus, Siddhartha by Herman Hesse, and various Buddhist texts instead. Regurgitating Eastern philosophy and existentialism while swearing a lot only gets you so far. I stopped reading and returned this book."

Most of it was sort of a ""duh"" for me, but I continued on in hopes I would learn something new...WOW, this author is SO self-indulgent. He misses no opportunity to remind us about what a complete ""fuckboi"" he was in his twenties. The problem with this is that his tone (and the fact that he brings it up over and over and over and over again) makes it sound like it is almost a point of pride rather than something to be remorseful about. There are a lot of (re-packaged Buddhist and psych) truth nuggets in here, but they're definitely mired in a lot of privileged bullshit. "
9,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28323108-a-rather-bookish,1,"Has anybody been unfortunate enough to be sitting in a pub/restaurant, enjoying the ambience and possibly a meal, and out of nowhere, a rather drunk individual parks himself beside you, grinning profusely, and then just doesn't stop talking about his life, your life and everything HE thinks that you should be doing, but without any solid proof to back himself up? I have, and this book by Mark Manson made me feel like I was back in that pub, but with an even dodgier individual attempting to give me life lessons. Seeing this book for the first time, I'll admit, I was pretty revved up about reading it. I mean, lets be honest, a bright orange cover with ""The subtle art of not giving a fu*k"" boldly plastered on it, you can hardly miss it. The book began with an introduction, which made me feel like this was was going to be a truly life changing read. Well, from the words ""Chapter one"" it all took a swift nose dive. Manson began the first few chapters with a lot of ""Fuck this, fuck that, fuck you"" kind of attitude. I can take cursing, but this, was kind of tiring. This was like listening to a young person that has just discovered the art of cursing. It sucked. There were some interesting points, but you need to dig deep to find them. I found that this book had mostly opinions, with a few hidden facts chucked in for good measure. I cannot understand how Romeo and Juliet could be brought into this book, then a couple of pages later, Buddhism, and then many fucks later, he is telling us that HE is amazing, as he has the audacity to inform his wife when she looks shitty, and, best of all, apparently she loves that. I just don't buy it.For me, this book is just a preachy retelling of stuff we already know, written by an average male and, I'm still trying to understand what possessed me to spend actual money on this! Absolutely no fucks given."
10,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2986658-jen,2,"Based on the title, I was pretty stoked for this, and the introductory essay explaining the author's Not Giving a F*ck theory made a lot of sense to me and made me really happy. Essentially, he says that the internet and the media demand that we give a f*ck about everything, but we only have so much time on Earth and so many f*cks to give and we have to choose who and what we spend those f*cks on. Makes sense.Unfortunately, the rest of the book turns into the same self-help drivel you see in any other ""how to be happy"" kind of book, only Manson starts to present the information with a tone reminiscent of an Andrew Dice Clay routine. No bueno. I ended up having to bail."
11,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1642452-kenny,1,"“Giving too many fucks is bad for you.”The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck, Mark MansonWhere to begin? Well for starters, Mark Manson is a real douche. There has never been a better husband than Mark Manson. Why? He doesn't put up with bullshit. If his wife looks like shit he tells her. He won't tolerate her looking bad no matter how much time she has spent getting ready to go out. And we must take note of how edgy Manson is. He actually figured out you can remove the word care and replace it with fuck. WOW! How profound! What he really means in the quote above is caring too much is bad for you. Oh, let's not forget how he loves to give added emphasis to things. When talking about music, it's not enough to reference The Beatles, they are the The GODDAMN Beatles. What Manson has done here is dust off some older self-help philosophies, replace as many words as possible with FUCK and tried to make it look shiny, new and innovative. It's not. Manson proudly announces he cuts through the crap! But alas, he does not. What Manson really does is steal some ideas from Buddhism and works hard to make himself look like a wise philosopher, and old soul. There are only so many things we can care about so we need to figure out which ones really matter ~~ sorry ~~ There are only so many things we can give a fuck about so we need to figure out which ones really matter. Or how about this gem: ""While money is nice, caring about what you do with your life is better, because true wealth is about experience."" Wow! While Manson pats himself on the back for this gem, I can't help but think of Emerson, “Its the not the Destination, It's the journey.” Thankfully, Manson brilliantly improves on Emerson and makes himself so much more profound in this generation-defining self-help guide. Most of Manson's observations make me roll my eyes, or at times, laugh out loud. How did we survive as a society without Mark Manson?Manson has a new book coming out in May. Maybe I'll read it, but probably not, because honestly, I just don't give a fuck ..."

If you need a book to help you live your life you have bigger problems than whatever brought you to that book. That may seem harsh but its just my opinion and you are free to ignore it.Since I don't read self-help, you may be asking ""Erin, Why did you read this book? Blame Popsugar. I'm doing the Popsugar 2017 Reading challenge and needed to read a book from a genre I don't usually read. As you can see if you look at my book shelf I pretty much read every genre. So I narrowed it down to 3 genres: Self-help, Christian, or Amish Romance. I picked Self-help. Mark Manson is proof that anyone can get a book deal. I understand that he has a very popular blog and publishing is about money but God this book is bad. I found myself speed reading it just so it would end. Mark Manson is shallow, smug, and completely uninformed about everything that he was trying to talk about. You know what I don't give a fuck about? This book. DON'T READ IT. AVOID AT ALL COST!

14,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1720620-anne,3,"My, my! What a catchy title!I wanted to see what all the hype was about, so I picked this up. And now that I'm done? Well, I agree with everything Manson says, but (like other reviewers have mentioned) everything he's written about is common sense stuff. Is that revolutionary?Maybe.What does it say about our society in general that any of what he's saying is...well, remotely necessary to say!?When the basic premise of a bestseller is that you should stop comparing yourself to what you see on television, movies, and social media, and just be content to be the best version of yourself - and scads of people find this to be awe-inspiring? Then perhaps it really did need to be said.The gist of this ""groundbreaking"" book is that there's no way to insulate yourself from bad times, and even if you could, those hardships are what make us better people. One of the biggest problems we seem to have is this nonsensical idea that chasing happiness is a worthwhile goal. I mean, it sounds great on paper, but it's not in any way, shape, or form realisitc...or healthy. Life will not give you a happy ending. Period. Endings are always sad. And we need to get over this ridiculous idea that at some point we'll get to sigh a big sigh of relief because our fairytale Happily Ever After has arrived.We can all save ourselves the trouble of trying to find happiness by just realizing that we need to choose to be happy now. Enjoy the small stuff, my friends, because tomorrow might just suck a giant dick. Your life will be good until it isn't. You'll be in love until you aren't. Your job will be fulfilling until you lose it. You'll be alive until you're dead. And nothing you do will change that.Ok, granted, that doesn't sound awesome.But the point is, if you stop trying to live for some future Happiness High, prioritize what means the most to you now, and live with a fearless attitude towards the future? Then you're going to be much more content (and yes, happy) than someone who is constantly trying to measure up to unrealistic goals they've set in order achieve a sense of fulfillment.The end.The book itself is fairly short and Manson's voice isn't terribly annoying.Read it or not. I don't give a fuck."
15,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23381142-nat,4,"I went into this admittedly with quite some skepticism and entitlement— “what is this going to teach me that I don’t already know?”— but The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck is truly one of the most ground-shaping nonfiction books I’ve read so far. It will and can change a perspective, a life. And as such, this is the perfect book to give to your loved ones on holidays, birthdays...It made me rethink all the times I ever gave a fuck over some of the most irrelevant things in hindsight. It made me realize that it’s sometimes necessary to take a step back and re-evaluate why I think so-and-so on a daily basis.I also wrote down a lot of Mark Manson’s writing into my notes because I knew I would need it in the near future. And I would like to thank him for answering quite a lot of fears of mine with such a dose of raw, refreshing, honest truth.The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck was both personally relevant and entertaining.Here are a few pieces that helped me and then some:“The key to a good life is not giving a fuck about more; it’s giving a fuck about less, giving a fuck about only what is true and immediate and important.”“Because when you give too many fucks—when you give a fuck about everyone and everything—you will feel that you’re perpetually entitled to be comfortable and happy at all times, that everything is supposed to be just exactly the fucking way you want it to be. This is a sickness. And it will eat you alive. You will see every adversity as an injustice, every challenge as a failure, every inconvenience as a personal slight, every disagreement as a betrayal. You will be confined to your own petty, skull-sized hell, burning with entitlement and bluster, running circles around your very own personal Feedback Loop from Hell, in constant motion yet arriving nowhere”YES! This is exactly how I feel when I give too many fucks about things that have little lasting impact on my life.“Life is essentially an endless series of problems, Mark,” the panda told me. He sipped his drink and adjusted the little pink umbrella. “The solution to one problem is merely the creation of the next one.”A moment passed, and then I wondered where the fuck the talking panda came from. And while we’re at it, who made these margaritas?“Don’t hope for a life without problems,” the panda said. “There’s no such thing. Instead, hope for a life full of good problems.”Disappointment Panda was one of the best additions to this book.“Who you are is defined by what you’re willing to struggle for. People who enjoy the struggles of a gym are the ones who run triathlons and have chiseled abs and can bench-press a small house. People who enjoy long workweeks and the politics of the corporate ladder are the ones who fly to the top of it. People who enjoy the stresses and uncertainties of the starving artist lifestyle are ultimately the ones who live it and make it.This is not about willpower or grit. This is not another admonishment of “no pain, no gain.” This is the most simple and basic component of life: our struggles determine our successes. Our problems birth our happiness, along with slightly better, slightly upgraded problems.See: it’s a never-ending upward spiral. And if you think at any point you’re allowed to stop climbing, I’m afraid you’re missing the point. Because the joy is in the climb itself.”This book is slowly but surely shifting my world.“If you want to change how you see your problems, you have to change what you value and/or how you measure failure/success.”“Honesty is a good value because it’s something you have complete control over, it reflects reality, and it benefits others (even if it’s sometimes unpleasant). Popularity, on the other hand, is a bad value. If that’s your value, and if your metric is being the most popular guy/girl at the dance party, much of what happens will be out of your control: you don’t know who else will be at the event, and you probably won’t know who half those people are. Second, the value/metric isn’t based on reality: you may feel popular or unpopular, when in fact you have no fucking clue what anybody else really thinks about you. (Side Note: As a rule, people who are terrified of what others think about them are actually terrified of all the shitty things they think about themselves being reflected back at them.)”That side note is speaking the truth!!!“I’m not saying that this excused what my ex did—not at all. But recognizing my mistakes helped me to realize that I perhaps hadn’t been the innocent victim I’d believed myself to be. That I had a role to play in enabling the shitty relationship to continue for as long as it did. After all, people who date each other tend to have similar values. And if I dated someone with shitty values for that long, what did that say about me and my values? I learned the hard way that if the people in your relationships are selfish and doing hurtful things, it’s likely you are too, you just don’t realize it.”Taking responsibly for your actions, but not blaming yourself was one of the most valuable lessons I got from Mark Manson.“A lot of people might hear all of this and then say something like, “Okay, but how? I get that my values suck and that I avoid responsibility for all of my problems and that I’m an entitled little shit who thinks the world should revolve around me and every inconvenience I experience—but how do I change?”And to this I say, in my best Yoda impersonation: “Do, or do not; there is no ‘how.’ ”You are already choosing, in every moment of every day, what to give a fuck about, so change is as simple as choosing to give a fuck about something else.It really is that simple. It’s just not easy.It’s not easy because you’re going to feel like a loser, a fraud, a dumbass at first. You’re going to be nervous. You’re going to freak out. You may get pissed off at your wife or your friends or your father in the process. These are all side effects of changing your values, of changing the fucks you’re giving. But they are inevitable.It’s simple but really, really hard.”“Growth is an endlessly iterative process. When we learn something new, we don’t go from “wrong” to “right.” Rather, we go from wrong to slightly less wrong. And when we learn something additional, we go from slightly less wrong to slightly less wrong than that, and then to even less wrong than that, and so on. We are always in the process of approaching truth and perfection without actually ever reaching truth or perfection.”He’s changing my world right now.“We all have values for ourselves. We protect these values. We try to live up to them and we justify them and maintain them. Even if we don’t mean to, that’s how our brain is wired. As noted before, we’re unfairly biased toward what we already know, what we believe to be certain. If I believe I’m a nice guy, I’ll avoid situations that could potentially contradict that belief. If I believe I’m an awesome cook, I’ll seek out opportunities to prove that to myself over and over again. The belief always takes precedence. Until we change how we view ourselves, what we believe we are and are not, we cannot overcome our avoidance and anxiety. We cannot change.In this way, “knowing yourself” or “finding yourself” can be dangerous. It can cement you into a strict role and saddle you with unnecessary expectations. It can close you off to inner potential and outer opportunities.I say don’t find yourself. I say never know who you are. Because that’s what keeps you striving and discovering. And it forces you to remain humble in your judgments and accepting of the differences in others.”I didn't even realize I felt this way until I saw it so clearly on paper.“There’s a kind of self-absorption that comes with fear based on an irrational certainty. When you assume that your plane is the one that’s going to crash, or that your project idea is the stupid one everyone is going to laugh at, or that you’re the one everyone is going to choose to mock or ignore, you’re implicitly telling yourself, “I’m the exception; I’m unlike everybody else; I’m different and special.”This is narcissism, pure and simple. You feel as though your problems deserve to be treated differently, that your problems have some unique math to them that doesn’t obey the laws of the physical universe.My recommendation: don’t be special; don’t be unique. Redefine your metrics in mundane and broad ways. Choose to measure yourself not as a rising star or an undiscovered genius. Choose to measure yourself not as some horrible victim or dismal failure. Instead, measure yourself by more mundane identities: a student, a partner, a friend, a creator.”That thing about the plane is 100% me!! So I get it know: if you think you’re special—decide not to be.“The desire to avoid rejection at all costs, to avoid confrontation and conflict, the desire to attempt to accept everything equally and to make everything cohere and harmonize, is a deep and subtle form of entitlement. Entitled people, because they feel as though they deserve to feel great all the time, avoid rejecting anything because doing so might make them or someone else feel bad. And because they refuse to reject anything, they live a valueless, pleasure-driven, and self-absorbed life. All they give a fuck about is sustaining the high a little bit longer, to avoid the inevitable failures of their life, to pretend the suffering away.”“If you make a sacrifice for someone you care about, it needs to be because you want to, not because you feel obligated or because you fear the consequences of not doing so. If your partner is going to make a sacrifice for you, it needs to because he or she genuinely wants to, not because you’ve manipulated the sacrifice through anger or guilt. Acts of love are valid only if they’re performed without conditions or expectations.”

Damn, I wasn’t prepared for The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck to completely change my worldview in such a meaningful way.

He is probably having a great old laugh at the fact that his mantra `dont try` has resulted in an awful written book, full of cliches, calling reader `dumbass`, referring to us wanting to feel jennifer aniston`s t#ts , and bigging himself up generally.

17,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5253785-lyn,3,"A lot of necessary to hear hard truths.There is a distinction between what the title implies and what Manson intends. Manson is essentially inviting us to only care about what’s important and let the rest take care of itself.I’ve been accused of indifference or “living in a bubble” for years because I don’t follow politics and rarely watch the news. My mantra is the serenity prayer:God grant me the serenityto accept the things I cannot change; courage to change the things I can; and wisdom to know the difference.My Muslim friends will sometimes say “Inshallah” which literally translates into “if Allah wills it” or “If God wills it”. When I first heard this, I mistakenly thought it was akin to “screw it” or “I don’t care” but I think this is more similar to the serenity prayer and also what Manson is talking about.I learned years ago that I cannot help or fix everything and to even try is unfair to me, the people I most care about and ultimately the people I am trying to help also. Spread yourself too thin, care too much, give a f*** about stuff that is beyond your reach, and you’re setting yourself up for failure.Manson steers clear of religion for the most part (he does reference Buddhism a few times) and most of his self-help is philosophical in nature. He also provides plenty of illuminating anecdotes to illustrate his perspicacious observations. This also made me consider Aaron James’ 2012 book Assholes: A Theory as Manson spends a fair amount of time describing the actions and motivations of those among us who feel entitled.A fun and insightful book.** 2018 - Great book to think back on and its simple truths. I do give a f***, but I can't fix everything and I accept that. Ultimately its about boundaries and priorities. "

In essence, the question is, should I really give a f*ck?This is sort of an anti-hero self-help book, something you should read (or hear) if you feel the world weighing up a little bit too much. It just unburdens you of some stuff. No real groundbreaking philosophy, just a couple of useful hints and insights on how to take things more lightly, when taking them seriously is hurting you. Chapters 1 and 2 were pure magic. The kind of magic that wouldn't be too bad to hear once or twice a year. If not for the hints, for the laughs. There are also some interesting comments on chapter 8, and some anecdotes here and there. The rest of the book was kind of meh. Funny meh, sure, but typical self-help textbook lines that tires a bit, if not a lot. Couldn't be happier to have chosen audio rather than ebook. Cursing can seem very aggressive when reading it on text, but hearing it through the voice of the narrator it became so much easier, and funnier. Tips: Don't take it too seriously, develop a tolerance to hear the word f*ck once too many often, and just enjoy the ride.Until next time,-----------------------------------------------No es sobre que nada te importe un c*rajo. Es sobre que te importe un c*rajo sólo las cosas importantes. En esencia, la pregunta es, debería realmente importame un c*rajo?Este es como el anti-heroe de los libros de autoayuda. Algo que uno debería leer (o escuchar) si empezás a sentír que el mundo te pesa mucho sobre los hombros. Sólo te libera de algunas cosas. No tiene ninguna filosofía innovadora, sólo un par de consejos y observaciones sobre cómo tomar las cosas más ligeramente, cuando tomártelas en serio te hace daño.Los capítulos 1 y 2 fueron pura magia. Ese tipo de magia que no viene mal escucharla una o dos veces al año. Sino por los consejos, por las risas. Tiene también algunos comentarios interesantes en el capítulo 8, y alguna que otra anéctoda aquí y allá. El resto del libro es medio meh, meh gracioso sí, pero típica retórica de autoayuda que cansa un poco, sino mucho.No podría estar más feliz de haberlo escuchado en vez de leerlo. Las puteadas pueden sonar muy agresivas cuando uno las lee en texto, pero escucharlas a través de la voz del narrador hace que sea mucho más ameno, y gracioso.Consejos: No tomarlo muy en serio, desarrollar una tolerancia a escuchar puteadas algo más que seguido, y sólo disfrutar el viaje.Hasta la próxima,"

This book wasn't only about giving no fucks, it was about giving fucks about only the important things. If you're going to read it, I would recommend the audio book. I thought the narration was great and it was highly entertaining and made me laugh out loud more than once!!"
20,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/175635-trevor,3,"My sister asked me to get her this and I’ve read it as well. It is basically the Buddha and Sartre giving advice by saying fuck every other word. Not a terrible thing, in itself, but a bit like seeing a play where all the actors are naked, the swearing loses its impact after about the third fuck, and then you’re just left with the advice.I don’t normally read self-help books – the problem I have with them is the first word, more than the second. We generally all need some sort of help, but that rarely is helped much by any notion of ‘self’. Ultimately, this guy says much the same thing, which rather surprised me, but shouldn’t have – I’ve already mentioned Buddhism, which has a particularly low opinion of selfhood. But we are so obsessed with being individuals in our society that he probably didn’t feel he could just come out and say from the start – well, get over yourself, fuck face.His advice is basically that you only have so many fucks you can give in life – but life tries to structure itself so that we are in a near perpetual state of outrage. And that way heart attacks lie. His advice isn’t to stop caring, that would be impossible, but to try to decide what you are going to care about and, well, do something about that. In some ways this isn’t too different from something I read by Byung-Chul Han recently – that outrage never changed the world, only rage can. So, pick what you are going to be enraged about and skip the outrage.This isn’t a terrible book, in fact, most of the advice is quite reasonable. All the same, I feel most of the problems we face as humans are to do with the fact we are social animals and our lives are becoming increasingly insular – not least due to various forms of technology – and this is making us feel pretty awful about ourselves. We need to find ways to rebuild communities and meaningful human interactions. And we’ve known this for ages – have a quick read of Durkheim’s Suicide and his explanation of why Catholics and Jews have lower rates of suicide than Protestants. Our obsession with being individuals is literally killing us. The fact this guy bases much of his advice on psychology, to me anyway, is part of the problem – I figure it involves him looking intently down the wrong end of the telescope – but all the same, this is a quick and easy read and parts of it are amusing."

Hadn't I displayed such amazing powers of prescience and precognition and stuff, the murderous crustaceans would have no doubt been slightly unleashed on a certain person who, come to think of it, probably would not have given half a quarter of a fuck about it, because he is so wonderfully detached like that.

Instagram || Twitter || Facebook || Amazon || PinterestPsychological snake oil for the pseudo intellectual.Man, reading this book was so frustrating, because I'd heard so many good things. Some people told me that this book was life-changing, game-changing, and then one of my co-workers gave it to me and I thought, ""Cool, bring it on. I'm ready to hand out fuck-wafers like it's time for the Sunday Communion of Nobody-Gives-A-Damn."" After reading this book, I've come to the conclusion that the people who like this book haven't taken any psychology classes or read any philosophy books, because this is like the watered-down, urban legend- and common sense-based rehashing of basic tenets you would learn in Phi or Psych 101. Mark Manson seems to me like a dudebro, tossing around the word ""fuck"" like a preteen who's just discovered swearing. But only for the first couple chapters. Then he forgets himself to his navel-gazing, talking about how we should change our values in life and how emotions only affect us insofar as we let them. Which is true, to an extent, but then he brings up how someone who had lost their son prematurely got mad at him on his blog, and Manson gets so upset about it that he feels the need to whine about his experience here, bragging to us about how he decided not to have the last word. But isn't that what you're doing here? You are giving a fuck, and you are immortalizing that fuck you gave in print, while telling us simultaneously that you did not give it. Hmm, sketchy.He also talks about his trip to Russia and praises the Russians for not sugar-coating and telling it like it is, the takeaway being that he admired them for saying ""That's stupid,"" when someone says something stupid. Then he brags about how he likes to tell his wife when she doesn't look good, and how much she appreciates this gaslighting, and how few men would dare to do this amazing thing that he is doing (telling her she looks like shit, according to him). She gets angry, he says, but ultimately she appreciates his honesty. Yeah, I fucking bet. This was straight out of those gross pick-up artist books that teach generations of young males how to neg women to win sex points. #NotAllMenManson had a couple good points, but they were buried in a lot of garbage. For example, in a chapter about relationships, he opens up with the synopsis of Romeo and Juliet as a cautionary example, but then he also tries to namedrop actual science like Philip Zimbardo's Stanford Prison Experiments, and then also namedrops the Buddha when talking about suffering and the inevitability of pain and strife. I am a psychology major who worked in a research laboratory as an undergraduate and I like hard science with data and solid case examples. When I see an article that looks fishy, I look up the facts to determine whether or not it is true. I read scholarly articles. I don't fuck with bullshit. I would rather give a fuck than fuck with bullshit, if you get me. This book did not have facts. It had a lot of opinions masquerading with facts, but honestly, if I want someone to preach dime-store philosophy at me, I'll go to a bar in downtown San Francisco and listen to the vodka fume revelations of CFOs.2 fucks given"
23,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2355889-chance-lee,5,"I'm not one for self-help books, but this one spoke to me: ""The desire for more positive experience is itself a negative experience. And, paradoxically, the acceptance of one's negative experience is itself a positive experience."" I don't know how to review this book without typing out the whole book, so I'm going to try something different: to be brief. This book provides support for someone who wants to live in reality, someone who doesn't want to buy into our national capitalist mindset that life is about chasing one high after another. This book encourages you to embrace conflict, to be comfortable feeling uncomfortable, and to be confident in finding out what you truly believe in, then standing up for it. Fuck being likeable. Take responsibility for your own life, stop trying to solve other's problems (a big one for me to work on!), ask questions, and always try to make things better. ""Happiness is a struggle.""My one criticism of this book eventually turned into a positive. Around Chapter Six my interest started to wane because Manson provided me with very little I didn't already know. Plus, he shares his own story about entering his adult life at ""rock bottom."" His life's lowest points: getting caught with marijuana at school, his parents' divorce, not finding a job immediately after college. My initial reaction was, are you fucking kidding me? If that's rock bottom, my life exists in a subterranean cavern. However, Mark Manson's life is not mine. Everyone's experiences are subjective. And, in a way, I admire him even more because of our differences. He led an easy life compared to mine, but he recognized his own privileges and entitlements and worked toward fixing them. Then, he took his own personal realizations about life and shared them in this book, which in turn helps me and others. I rarely read a book that makes me want to thank the author, but -- Thanks for this, Mark. "

25,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66224803-jessi-h-vojsk,5,"Oh, wow. I loved this. I really really loved this. I loved that this was so... freely written. Who cares if there are tons of curses in it? Everything he says or teaches us is always followed or introduced with a personal or historical story. There are always examples, stories, explanations that are not overly complicated. The whole book was full of honest, true and really interesting stuff. These were my favorite: - Not giving a fuck does not mean being indifferent, it means being comfortable with being different. - Pain, in all of its forms, is our body’s most effective means of spurring action. - People who become great at something become great because they understand that they’re not already great - they are mediocre, they are average - and that they could be so much better. - Self-awareness is like an onion. There are multiple layers to it, and the more you peel them back, the more likely you’re going to start crying at inappropriate times. - This is because you always get to choose how you see things, how you react to things, how you value things. - Until we change how we view ourselves, what we believe we are and are not, we cannot overcome our avoidance and anxiety. We cannot change. - If you’re stuck on a problem, don’t sit there and think about it, just start working on it. Even if you don’t know what you’re doing, the simple act of working on it will eventually cause the right ideas to show up in your head. - You too are going to die, and that’s because you too were fortunate enough to have lived. All in all I’ll just recommend this to all my non-reader friends and to you, my wonderful Goodreads people, because I loved it and I want you to read this too! Happy reading ♥️"
26,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54464244-hamad,3,"This review and other non-spoilery reviews can be found @The Book Prescription  “Life is essentially an endless series of problems. The solution to one problem is merely the creation of another.”🌟 I am not a big fan of Self Help books to be honest. I try to avoid them as much as possible. I just believe that we all have different experiences and we will learn by trying. I also believe that most of what those Self help books are saying is just so obvious and I don’t need to read about it to know it. Despite that, I enjoyed the book and can not say that it won’t affect me one way or another.🌟 The book starts out by cussing, actually a lot! I was not happy by all of that Effing going around but then it became cooler and easier to read. There was a lot of repetition to be honest. Like the idea would be repeated too many times through different chapter in a kind of similar wording.🌟 I enjoyed the real life examples that the book provides and these are always better than the theoretical part. One of the things that I will be applying is to check which metric I am using. A concept that was discussed for the whole part of the book and I think it was the most important one. For example: As book bloggers we have to choose a metric: Is it going to be how much followers I have and having a certain goal in mind or comparing your follower to a large blog. In the first case, a blogger will be happy for example with 100 followers while in the later case, the blogger will keep trying to reach an ever-growing blog and will feel that they are not achieving anything.🌟 Summary: I know this book will not be for everyone and that many will hate it as evidenced by the many 1 stars in the top reviews pages on GR. I believe that you can get something out of this book even if you are not a fan of self-help books as me. I read it because I wanted a less stressful 2019 and I hope it helps me in achieving so. I ended up giving it 3.5 out of 5 stars."

The language isn't really an issue (it just becomes another word that doesn't even seem to have much meaning); it's more that Manson is repetitive and doesn't offer anything original that most people haven't learned for themselves in a few decades of experience. For me, the same ideas are expressed much more elegantly, cogently, and thoroughly in The Antidote: Happiness for People Who Can't Stand Positive Thinking."

The book is a reaction to the self-help industry and what Manson saw as a culture of mindless positivity that isn't practical or helpful for most people. Manson uses many of his own personal experiences to illustrate how life's struggles often give it more meaning, which, he argues, is a better approach than constantly trying to be happy. Manson's approach and writing style have been categorized by some as contrarian to the general self-help industry, using blunt honesty and profanity to illustrate his ideas.The book has 9 chapters with the following titles:1. Don't Try.2. Happiness is a problem.3. You are not special.4. The value of suffering.5. You are always choosing.6. You are wrong about everything (But so am I).7. Failure is the way forward.8.

Instead I got a collection of banal insights, wrapped in supposedly funny dirty-talk. References to philosophy/literature were reminiscent of an author who just skimmed through ""100 ideas in X you need to know"" and didn't bother further. They were forced and off-beat especially considering the overall tone, which itself fluctuated between the earnestness of self-help drivel and the tongue-in-cheek of comedy memoirs. Ironically, this was the only convincing argument made to support the point on making choices to narrow down your options. Looks like the author didn’t even follow his own advice."

Book has no originality and better writers have written more brilliantly about these topics. Entire thing boils down to irritating, naive, amateur psychology from a douchebag in serious ignorance of his douchebaggery. The book suffers from the problem of extremes. In this case, in attempting to correct for admittedly nauseating over positivity bullshit, the author is now guilty of the same crap in the opposite direction - an over glorification of suffering. This is just as much of a crap fest as what he claims to be avoiding. Laughable part is that dude is an entitled little shithead who's got no understanding of suffering. There's even more considerable lack of understanding of medical/scientific research and on some level he seems to believe that people with real psychological issues should just get over themselves cause everyone has problems. When a human being gets to a point where he can equate his self imposed drugged infused decade of ""trauma"" stemming from his parents divorce to the real trauma of a father losing his son, that's serious entitled bullshit! To conclude that someone who has suffered through hellish circumstances can just move on based on cherry picked examples of celebrities making it, is pathetically superficial. This kind of crappy thinking is what results in selfish individuals who can only empathize with others if they have gone through similar experiences themselves. Books like this don't move the dial in improving humanity, they just create/justify narcissistic characters who hide their narcissism behind a wall of false self improvement. This author is no different from the cultish positivity people he scorns. He spews the same sanctimonious, bullshit rhetoric where he pats himself on the back by stating how his values help make the world better! His whole unoriginal theory of put on your big boy panties and get over yourself mentality is just as terrible as the whole disappear into some zen bullshit crapfest. It's this kind of mentality that makes people say if I could make it, I don't get why anyone else can't either. It fails to recognize differences in circumstances. I'm all for suck it up and deal with life but the ability to fail to recognize that maybe the dad with the dead kid has suffered more pain than the asshole with the cheating ex girlfriend is ludicrous! What this guy has done is surround himself with folks so obviously dysfunctional, he ends up looking like the king in a world of spectacular ignorance. The question that should be asked as he gives multiple examples of his idiotic friends being assholes, is how has he managed to collect so many terrible people in his circle? What does this say about his values and judgement? In the end, author is no different from his douchebag ""friend"" he described in the earlier chapters except unlike the friend who limited himself to sponging off of relatives, this dude has expanded his narcissistic reach to a wider audience. Still playing the victim of the trauma of his parents divorce, still standing for nothing except the right to say what he wants, when he wants to whoever he wants. There's a word for people like that - douchebag! "
37,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16131467-nate-icart,1,"I absolutely hated this book. Reasons why:-The author's jokes were terrible. His style of humor is just to add a random number to an example (""I felt like I was punched 253 times in the stomach""). -Many (most) of the concepts in this book are ripped from common bodies of knowledge (he explains the basic economic concept of opportunity cost like he was the one who discovered it)-His experiences all feel fake. He talks about how came to deep realizations about his life when we was a fresh college graduate -- not that this is impossible, just very unlikely.-The first few chapters have the word ""Fuck"" in them so much that it just feels like he's making excuses to say it. I like swearing, but every time he talks about sex he calls it ""fucking"". No one talks like that.-It's very hard to take a 32 year old self-help guru seriously when they don't have a real life like the rest of us. He's been a world-traveler and an extremely popular blogger for years. He explained that he only held a ""real"" job for 6 weeks post-graduation. Who can relate to this?-The best part about this book is the cover. Manson is good at marketing, and he's good in short-form (like on his blog), but I will never read another book that he writes."

However, the title of this book piqued my curiosity and it perpetually appears on the main page of Audible as a best seller, thus furthering my interest to pick it up. As an audiobook, I did enjoy this quite a fair bit as the narrator was good and brought life to the narrative. Admittedly, the advice contained herein was not ground-breaking, but delivered in a refreshing and humourous manner. It served as a reminder as to what we probably already know in the deep, dark recesses of our minds, but are too caught up in the hectic modern life and excesses for greater inner reflection. I find a few of the real-life examples quoted to be quite relevant and effective.

Who you are is defined by what you're willing to struggle for.

The title is slightly misleading as the book is not so much as to how not to give a f*ck but to choose what is important enough to give a f*ck about. It is about getting our priorities and values right so that we pick the right battles which truly matter in making our lives count for something. If we start giving a f*ck about every little thing, we will end up spending too much energy on trivial matters and being generally uncontented about life. While it is fine not to feel positive all the time, learning how to channel that in the right direction and taking charge of your life where it is possible to make a difference are the essential messages the book is getting across to the reader. The one theme that was discussed which I feel very strongly about was concerning the 'sense of entitlement' and how this can be destructive in the way one views his or her life. And social media is probably the biggest culprit in propagating this negative view to a whole new level. Being constantly bombarded with reality shows, Instagrams and blogs of beautiful people enjoying a beautiful life, we start to ask ""Why can't I be like so-and-so?"" or ""Why can't I have this or that too?"". As a 14-year old niece of mine rightly pointed out, Instagram represents filtered existence. It seems almost natural now for most to block out the unfavourable or darker segments of life or humanity - such as poverty, hunger, war, violence, human trafficking, prostitution, etc. Instead, we moan and groan about the 'unfortunate circumstances' of not being able to own nice cars and big houses, have great clothes and the requisite body to go with it, go on expensive holidays, or obtain that 'much-deserved' promotion at work - the list goes on and on.Anyway, I'm rambling - this is a topic that I can go on and on about, but that's not the point about this review. If you're curious, this is worth a read as it is quite funny and does not take up much time to finish. Even though much of what is said was nothing new, sometimes we just need that extra nudge.This review can also be found at Booknest"
39,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5759543-sam-quixote,3,"Eye-catching title, eh? Unfortunately that’s about all that really stands out about Mark Manson’s The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck, which is actually a very ordinary self-help book - and I’ve not even read a lot of self-help books either, that’s how broad, generic and unremarkable a lot of the stuff he talks about here is! Still, its ideas are ultimately positive and worth re-reading and keeping in mind so I can’t say I found the book a total waste of time. The book’s title and main thesis can be summed up as: finding and caring about the shit that matters to you while ignoring the shit that doesn’t - see what I mean when I say it’s unremarkable? But wait, there’s more! Manson has more vapid platitudes like how life’s about the journey, not the destination, how finding meaning in life is better than accumulating material possessions, and that, seeing as we’re all going to die one day, why waste our limited time on shit that doesn’t matter? Not that I disagree with any of that but there’s nothing new or special about that information and you definitely don’t need to read this book to hear that kind of stuff. In fact, you don’t even need to read it anywhere at all as these ideas are so ubiquitous in pop culture as to be cliched! But, like I said, the book also contains useful messages that are worth hearing whether or not you’ve come across them before. Messages like pain and struggle are necessary and unavoidable parts of life. That rising up to challenges and facing hard truths about ourselves help us grow as well as make us stronger at weathering the shit life inevitably throws our way. That failure - so long as we learn from it - eventually leads to success so we shouldn’t be afraid to keep trying even if we’ll probably fail. That dissatisfaction and being uncomfortable are good as they motivate us to change and improve ourselves and our circumstances. I agree that perspective and values are important and that adjusting these can lead to a more satisfying existence. This means accepting that you’ll probably never be rich and famous, that you’re probably not an undiscovered genius or great artist, or that anything you’ll ever do will have any lasting impact on future generations. And that realisation can be freeing to pursue the things that only matter to you.As Manson notes, nothing is certain, which is a profoundly obvious yet difficult lesson I’m slowly learning and re-learning all the time. We also have a tendency to create our own narratives that are confining and are worth exploding as they’re largely bullshit. And I totally agree with and can personally attest that taking more responsibility in your life leads to far greater happiness. Jocko Willink has a similar philosophy: Discipline Equals Freedom. But I don’t buy Manson’s anecdote that when he googled the quote “With great power comes great responsibility” he couldn’t find out who originally said it. As a comics reader, I instantly know it was Spider-Man’s Uncle Ben but I can’t believe a Google search wouldn’t tell him that! He’s right though when he says that excessive freedoms don’t lead to happiness. You only need to look at the toxic Social Justice movement currently poisoning Western politics whose adherents are obsessed with personal freedoms - none of those people are ever happy! His points on the importance of boundaries in relationships and healthy conflict stemming from honesty though were banal and unnecessary. I’m a terrible procrastinator so I really liked the “Do Something” principle where you just do whatever it is you should be doing rather than waiting for the “right moment” or inspiration to strike. The idea is that once you start doing something, especially badly, you’ll eventually start doing it right. Action leads to motivation leads to inspiration leads to success - basically a practical application of not being afraid of failure and one I’ll be trying out myself. I wasn’t that interested in Manson’s autobiographical anecdotes, which were mostly mundane, nor did I find a lot of the examples he chose to illustrate his ideas to be that compelling, though I do like the possibility that Shakespeare wrote Romeo & Juliet as a satire on love especially as so many view it as the ultimate romance story! I also don’t agree that caring less about something means you’ll do better at it or that great people become great because they don’t think they’re great which is why they work harder than most. Both are, like a lot of the statements he makes, an oversimplified generalisation. Maybe he’s right for some but maybe some others already think they’re great and are driven by something else? And, like all self-help books, it needs to be vague enough to be a one-size fits all for the widest possible appeal so I’m not sure how helpful it’s going to be in finding its audience’s meaning in their individual lives - it certainly didn’t mine! But on the whole Manson is a decent writer who’s able to put his ideas across quite clearly in an accessible way. The messaging may be fairly commonplace and underwhelming but I found enough good stuff here to have gotten something out of reading it and if you’ve read no self-help books at all you might find this even more useful! The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck is kinda worth giving a fuck about, just don’t expect much from it. "

But once I started, I thought it was good enough to keep going.The title is there for shock value, but it’s not a particularly shocking book, unless you’re easily put off by swearing. The author is not really advocating that we all drop everything and run to the beach. He’s arguing for recalibrating what matters to you, and acting on it.The secondary title - “a counterintuitive approach to living a good life” - is deceptive. There’s nothing counterintuitive here. There’s a lot of common sense. But it’s pretty good common sense. And also timely in many ways. So I didn’t have any aha moments, but I nodded my head a fair bit.The question that kept buzzing at the back of my mind is how likely people are to be able to make dramatic changes in their lives by being told to shift the focus on what matters to them. In other words, easier said than done. But still worth thinking about every now and then.I think I’ll stick to my ZERO self help books policy, but this wasn’t a bad foray out of my usual comfort zones."

And, paradoxically, the acceptance of one’s negative experience is itself a positive experience.""I never thought of reading this book. Saw a hype about it recently in a group on facebook. So I just wanted to know what this book is about. After reading the blurb on goodreads, I thought to give it a go, see what's the hype about. So I started listening to the audiobook. ""Not giving a fuck does not mean being indifferent; it means being comfortable with being different.""First thing I learned from this book is, never judge a book by its cover or title or first chapter. In the first chapter, the author said f*ck like a 100 times. I think there was no need to said that word this many times. I don't have any problem with saying fuck. But when I read/listen to fuck this many times in just one chapter, I cannot help but feel irritated. So yeah, I was irritated but decided to go on. And I am glad of my decision. ""Maturity is what happens when one learns to only give a fuck about what’s truly fuckworthy.""I don't think this book is an inspiring one. The writer didn't want to tell people how to be motivated or how to be a successful person. He simply told how to be happy in life. What is the mantra behind peace and happiness in one's life. And I have to say I totally agree. And that mantra is not giving a fuck. Well, now some may think that not giving a fuck means being indifferent to everything. But that's not true. There's a very thin line between being indifferent and being indifferent to the things that are not important in life. Mark Manson talked about this difference and how we care about everything. In this book, he shared many of his thoughts about happiness, emotion, sufferings, values, responsibilities, rejections, and relations of our life. And I agree with most of the things he said. You can say I am bragging but I found that my thoughts and ideas about life are a lot like Mark Manson. And yes I was lame and pathetic once. But I am growing. I am learning the subtle art of not giving a fuck. ""Being wrong opens us up to the possibility of change. Being wrong brings the opportunity for growth.""One thing I love while reading something is when I find some character I can relate to real life. And this book was full of it. Sometimes I find someone who is exactly like my friend, then someone pretty much like my boss and finally someone a lot like me. It was a major point why I liked this book. ""There is a simple realization from which all personal improvement and growth emerge. This is the realization that we, individually, are responsible for everything in our lives, no matter the external circumstances. We don’t always control what happens to us. But we always control how we interpret what happens to us, as well as how we respond. Whether we consciously recognize it or not, we are always responsible for our experiences.""There's one thing that I didn't understand the last chapter. And I was thinking of giving a star less for it. Then I thought maybe I haven't grown that much yet. So yeah I will reread the last chapter after two or three years and see if it makes any sense. So 5 stars for now... :D ""To be happy we need something to solve. Happiness is, therefore, a form of action..."""

The things mentioned in the book are logical and make immense sense, they're also presented with interesting and sometimes personal issues to get the idea. Manson's writing is straight to the point and natural; it flows like a conversation rather than a self-help rant. All this, and I still couldn't find much enthusiasm for the things being said because I find them to be basic things that I've always believed. It did give me a few things to consider and maybe look up, but I don't get why people keep telling me that it's ""life changing."""

BUT Mark Manson had a wonderful approach to his book. He is just a normal person without all that Botox and designer jeans that made his butt look bigger telling me he has many things HE has to work on a daily basis and what he had to overcome to not be a piece of shit psycho. I had to return the book to its rightful owner so I can't pick out my favorite quotes (and I'm not buying it for $30) but this book is very quotable and very raw.I have always known I am a people pleaser and I really hate that trait about me because I put myself in awkward positions and then resent the person I want to help because 1. They weren't grateful enough 2. They will never ever return the favor 3. They turned out to be shitty people. 4. I am just annoyed!So yes, it okay to say NO to people. I don't have to care about every little cause and I should definitely have my priorities straight. Stop being fake and surround yourself with people that are meaningful to you. Just do and see what happens from there. You are not unique and your problems are not unique so once you realize this you can just live your life without that carrot dangling over your sleep. With failure you learn about who you are and can grow as a person. Just because you failed at something doesn't mean you are a failure. Social media life is fake so you are not pathetic for not eating at Spago for lunch or being in the Caribbean this year. Be true to the person you want to be. There was more to it and Manson had some great stories in there. My Negatives- He said ""Fuck"" wwwaaayyy too much. I get it. That's the damn title of the book.Sometimes got repetitive.Overall- recommend."

I wouldn’t normally reach for a self help book, but Mark Moran’s The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck: A Counterintuitive Approach to Living a Good Life, was the pick for our book club this month. It also formed part of challenge read on 'read a self help guide' I have going with a fellow bookworm. I decided to give this book a chance and I went into reading it with an open mind, despite my reservations about the bold title. I surprised myself by enjoying this book. I found it a highly readable, direct, humorous and relatable guide. I wouldn’t say this is a self help book as such, but more a strategy in self evaluation. Many of the ideas and approaches Moran suggests we should take to change our lives are simple to implement and most probably have in the back of our minds – yet Moran suggest what we lack is courage to act on this. What Moran does is put these ideas in spotlight and his book works to give the reader the encouragement needed to put his notions into practice. What I appreciated the most about The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck was insertion of real life stories within this text. Moran linked his approaches to concrete scenarios, which gave his guide much more brevity. From the author Moran’s own back story from hitting rock bottom to becoming a blogger extraordinaire, to celebrity examples such as former Beatles drummer Pete Best and even World War II survivours - the message is clear in all cases. What almost breaks you may in fact make you a stronger, happier and better person. "

You will also get to meet the Disappointment Panda and figure out how would you deal with him.You will learn by yourself how everyone is given to choose their own struggles.You will know that it is not a must to me the superhero and the very special person in that exaggerating behavior, in a matter of fact, thus everyone should be one!

This book is for you!This book is not rocket science, it doesn't inform us of new matters that were unknown to us. Rather it tells you exactly what you already know, what is standing right in front of your nose, down in simple, friendly, invasive words that will leave you seeing things much more different than before.I have made it across a lot of various books, but this book is surely different. I believe this book was the hit on the head that I urgely needed to wake up and sort things out differently and to view all my priorities and values with an entirely conscious mind. And to put all my life, past and future, into question!This book will drive you to get hurt facing the inevitable truth, will make you show up your deepest wounds, will leave you in anger, rage and tears depending on what you have encountered in life and the VALUES you are living by.P.S.

I think it's an attempt to piggyback on the success of Marie Kondo's book by being ""inspired"" by the title and hoping people will pay money without looking too hard at the contents of the book."

In Manson's witty words, managing the amount of fucks you give. Minimizing the scope of your interests really—to the essentials. Putting all of your eggs in that one basket. Figuring out what that basket is in the first place. Does that make sense?I enjoyed a couple of ideas. One of them is on the importance of cultivating doubt. Manson claims that uncertainty is the way forward and that the key to personal growth lies in being comfortable with it. The comfort breeds an openness that obliterates sticking to rigid values and motivates us towards positive change. Uncertainty breaks the entitlement chain, the belief that you're a special snowflake who deserves special treatment from the world—the naivety of expecting something for nothing, to be loved for doing nothing, to be appreciated for doing nothing, and so on. To break the hold of the spell of certainty and entitlement, Mr. Manson proposes asking yourself three golden questions:1- What if I'm wrong? 2- What would it mean if I'm wrong? 3- Would me being wrong create better problems? I tried them for size and trust me, the sheer entertaining of the possibility of being wrong is refreshing. Also wonderful in cultivating compassion, humility, and acceptance of oneself and others. The success formula Manson proposes goes something like this:Happiness comes from solving problems, and the quality of your problems is determined by the quality of your values and metrics, the standards by which you measure your success. Naturally, the better the problems, the more successful you are. Good problems come from having good values and metrics. And so Manson dedicates more than half of his book to what he sees as the five most important values, and he summarizes them on page 89 in one paragraph:""The first ... is a radical form of responsibility: taking responsibility for everything that occurs in your life, regardless of who's at fault. The second is uncertainty: the acknowledgment of your own ignorance and the cultivation of constant doubt in your own beliefs. The next is failure ... The fourth is rejection: the ability to both say and hear no ... The final value is the contemplation of one's own mortality.""Another idea that stuck is the Do Something Principle, the idea that action can and sometimes should precede motivation. This reminded me of Ralph Waldo Emerson's famous quote: ""Do the thing and you shall have the power."" Most of us, unfortunately, spend our entire lives waiting for that power to come down, waiting for the muse instead of moving in the direction of our dreams. Action > Inspiration > Motivation > Action... (Loop) In the end, The Subtle Art is a sobering unconventional take on self-help, and I recommend it for people looking for just that. Three stars and a half, with a grain of salt. My rating came down from four and a half thanks to me cultivating doubt about this book. So here goes that Mr. Manson."

The avoidance of suffering is a form of suffering. The avoidance of struggle is a struggle. The denial of failure is a failure. Hiding what is shameful is itself a form of shame.Pain is an inextricable thread in the fabric of life, and to tear it out is not only impossible, but destructive: attempting to tear it out unravels everything else with it.

I can't explain how much i love this book. It was even more fun listening to it than reading it. Plus, it's a very short listen; about 6 hours if I remember correctly. It starts off pretty light-hearted and funny with some good points. Then it gets pretty heavy by the end. The last 2 chapter were probably my favorite. It's not a book about giving no fucks at all, only psychopaths and liars don't care about anything, but more so about figuring out what is worthy of the fucks you'll give. Whether you think you give too many fucks or aren't sure what to give a fuck about, read this book. At the very least it's worth using one of your audible credits on. "

58,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18989854-krystal,4,"First up, the title is clearly more for shock factor than an accurate title for this book since f*cks are still given, albeit selectively.Second, if bad language, crass stories and vulgar honesty offend you, this may not be an appropriate choice of reading material.Thirdly, these are not particularly new concepts. For alternative reads without the swearing and vulgarity, I'd recommend Daring Greatly: How the Courage to Be Vulnerable Transforms the Way We Live, Love, Parent, and Lead (my 5 star review here) and/or The Courage to be Disliked (my 4 star review here) I'm not a huge fan of swearing etc. myself but this was more about bluntness and simplicity rather than swearing for the sake of it so I didn't mind it quite so much. It's just honest and raw and is quite serious about making its point that no one and nothing is perfect.The point of this book is not to stop 'giving a f*ck', but to choose wisely the things you decide to care about. It raises the fairly common notion that true happiness is beyond the material, and caring about things you can't change (such as others' feelings) will do more harm than good. These ideas are something I definitely connect with, and I do think it's important to take responsibility for your own happiness. Yes, sometimes sh*tty things happen, but you have to find a way through the sh*t to ultimately become stronger, otherwise you're giving up happiness in favour of being a victim.The delivery is certainly not for everyone as there's no sympathy here, and the apathetic will be disappointed because instead of finding a common ideal this book hits with some hard truths. People who are offended easily will find plenty to be offended about, and it's easy to criticise the author for his sexist examples and analogies and the despicable behaviour of his past (which we only know because he has chosen to share). It starts with the message, 'don't try' and concludes with '...and then you die' and in between is a whole lot of 'you are not special', which honestly all sounds quite depressing but it really does make a lot of sense. It tells us we are not special, but then goes on to suggest why that might be so painful to hear. If you are open-minded, you'll understand and perhaps appreciate the wisdom in it; if you're more stubborn you'll close your eyes, cover your ears and repeat to yourself that you are special, no matter what this crappy little book says (thus increasing the pressure on yourself to be special). All in all, the book makes a lot of sense, but you have to be open and accepting enough to appreciate it.Side note: I was really surprised there were no references listed, considering how many names were dropped and psychology experiments referenced etc. Curious.If this rubbed you up the wrong way I'd definitely suggest giving Daring Greatly a chance, as it's a much more comprehensive (and kind) exploration of the same themes.This was book 24 in my #Dymocks52challenge refined.

(I won't use the * because it's pointless, why do we still do it?)I have a hate/like/hate/hate relationship with this genre. FOMO pushed me to reserve this on the library overdrive a while ago. Also, while it's becoming a publishing schtick, I enjoy swear words - as long as they're not in my native language. I don't know about you, but I would love to have the confidence of this American, middle-class, privileged white guy, with a finance degree, to come out and write a book on how to live your life the right way. I tried to keep an open mind, it's not his fault that he's American, middle-class etc., you know, #notallXYZ... Thank goodness, Roger Wayne, the narrator of this book was excellent, had it not been for him, and the audiobook's duration, I wouldn't have finished.The beginning was really promising, well, I liked it a lot, I thought this will be so up my alley, as it professed itself to be an anti self-help book, against that mindless positive crappolla that is prevalent in the field. I'm not so sure that was achieved.That's not to say there weren't good things in the book. As far as I'm concerned, nothing was new, groundbreaking or will impact me in any way (truthfully, not many, if any, books in the genre ever had, to my dismay, as there's so much room for improvement where I'm concerned). My biggest gripe with this book was that Manson doesn't seem to take into account people's genetic make-up and experiences. It is a complex notion, probably not covered when studying for a business degree, I know mine never did. Not to mention, saying that genes have a huge role in one's make-up would be counterintuitive and unproductive, as it wouldn't leave that much for the self-help gurus to write and preach about. "

62,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22583912-fareya,4,"I am not one to read a lot of self-help books, but this title caught my eyes. I mean, is the art of not giving a f*ck really subtle? I wouldn’t think so. Naturally, I was very curious on what the author has to say! So, I bought this bright orange catchy book and it sat on my shelf for almost two years, until a few days back when I finally picked it up, but only because I was in a fiction reading slump, not because I wanted a life coach coaching me on how to live. Honestly, I didn’t even expect to like this, but these slightly vulgar, no-nonsense, conversational 200 pages seriously surprised me.Let’s start with the language, which is easy to read and communicative, but the first fifty or so pages have an abundance of profanity in them, it’s left and right and thrown in with every other sentence. I admit I was somewhat put off by this, but with the title being what it is, this wasn’t completely unexpected. And more so, the philosophy and concepts the author talks about made so much sense, that I chose to overlook the vulgarism, and I am glad I did.“In life, we have limited amount of f*cks to give. So you must choose your f*cks wisely.”The quote mentioned above is essentially what I thought to be the crux of this book. Obviously, this one sentence is not as simple as it might seem. The idea behind not giving a f*ck is not about being indifferent but rather about being at ease with being different. It is about choosing one’s own battles and accepting one’s emotions, even if they are not always inherently positive.One of the best things I liked about this book was the talk on choice and acceptance, where the author emphasizes that it’s okay to have negative emotions and it’s okay to feel bad at times. What is important, is how we choose to deal with those emotions later. Convincing myself that I feel good, when I don’t, or believing that my life is perfect when in fact it is a total mess is not healthy. I seriously never believed in the be positive all the time and the situation will fix itself crap, so this was a welcome concept for me. How can a person be positive all the time, be happy all the time? That is simply not human! Pain and struggle is just as important as being happy. Negative emotions are just as important as their positive counterparts. Accepting is the way to go, not suppressing or denying. And most importantly, one needs to take action in order to change something.Anyway, moving on, this book has a bunch of other really profound and solid points to make. I’ll try summarizing a few of them briefly below:- stop blaming yourself and others and take responsibility for your actions- our struggles determine our successes, do not think you deserve something if you’re not willing to struggle for it- avoiding rejection, confrontation and conflicts and attempting to accept everything is a deep and subtle form of entitlement; avoid being an entitled, self-absorbed person- nothing in life is certain, better embrace the uncertaintyOne last thing worth mentioning is that this book also has a number of inspiring, real-life stories, including a few from the author’s life as well, that reinforce the philosophy and concepts stated. I thought that was a nice touch.That’s all. The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck: A Counterintuitive Approach to Living a Good Life , is an anti self help book, which I believe can be quite helpful. Remember though, you need to overlook its vulgarity and retain the thought-provoking, useful concepts!For more reviews visit my blog Booktimistic - Books, Outdoors & Optimism"

65,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6753400-gabrielle,3,"Warning: this review contains F-bombs. It seemed thematic.Anti-self help book, huh? Written by someone who is sick and tired of hearing incessant and aggravating platitudes about positive thinking? Fine, I’ll bite. Also, my dad bought me the follow up book for my birthday, and I wanted to do the preliminary reading before tearing into that one.I have always loathed asinine self-help books, you know the ones that keep telling you to be your best self and that good things will magically come your way… The problem with these books is that when whatever magical formula they are selling you doesn’t work (spoiler alert…), you just feel like an even bigger failure than you did when you shamefully bought the book on Amazon, so that no one would see you checking it out at the book store register. This is obviously not that book. And that got my attention, because I figured it was about time there be a book that told people to just, you know, be themselves, work with what they got and stop caring about the stuff that doesn’t actually matter. The fact that it was a best seller intrigued me: were people actually listening to this? Weird!Let me summarize the whole thing for you, in case you don’t have the patience (and good fortune to have a lovely colleague who will lend you his copy): we give to many fucks, and we need to learn to be more discriminate about the fucks we give. There is a finite amount of them, and we have to stop being so slutty with our fucks. And yes, that is the tenure of language you can expect if you do decide to read this cover to cover.Manson argues that we are caught up in the “always striving for more” vicious cycle that creates perpetual dissatisfaction and has serious consequences, such as the strain on our mental health, our consumer habits, our increasingly warped human interactions. And his solution is to stop caring so damn much about things that don’t matter, stop comparing ourselves to everyone on social media and use the so-called negative experiences we go through has building blocks for better experiences. The book takes those ideas and breaks them down into chewable pieces about the subtleties of Manson’s philosophy of “zero fucks given”.The dose of good old fashioned common sense (which I recently discovered was never meant as “everyone has it” common but rather has “for the good of everyone” common! Chew on that for a bit!), reality check and reminder to not sweat the small stuff is nice – and much needed in many cases. A little dose of sane perspective has never hurt anything else than someone’s ego, after all. Mark Manson didn’t exactly teach me anything, though bless his heart for trying so damn hard. But I’m glad this book is as popular as it is, because a lot of people do need to hear this. I did notice as I get older that I have gotten extremely selective with the amount of fucks I give, and I do tend to save them up for fewer things, and I can’t deny that it makes life better, and I honestly wish more people would unbunch their panties and get a little perspective. And as much as I hate to admit it, that book just might help unbunch a whole lot of panties.I like that Manson describes happiness as a work in progress and negative emotions as a call to action. I am glad he addressed the entitlement and mollycoddling issues that have been plaguing many milieus in the past few years (I like his phrasing here: “victimhood chic”), and that he reminds readers that where they are in life is a consequence of choices they have made, so they are responsible for their problem, and that everyone ought to be a bit more mindful of their intentions and motivations. A lot of people need to hear that. Hell, there have been times in my life when I needed to hear it too, and I am glad I did! That said, the book is far from perfect. It contains a quantity of lovely platitudes, the whole bad-ass attitude schtick gets old fast (and that’s coming from someone who uses the f-word as punctuation in her daily life). Also, I rolled my eyes at his “practical enlightenment” idea. I get what he means, but the term he coined rubs me the wrong way a little. As did his slap-dash retelling of the life of the Buddha. For the same reason. Also, I do not buy that his wife “likes” being told she looks like shit: I think that like any decent spouse, she has just learnt to accept a certain amount of BS, in her case, her husband’s lack of tact.My personal appreciation of this book would make it a 2-star read, but I also seriously think many people need to hear that stuff, no matter how condescending and unpleasant it comes across as, so I’m bumping it up to 3, because I’m glad it’s there. I hope it makes its way into the hands of few more people, who could really use the reality check."

But as I read along, it started to make more sense. At some points, I was amazed the author's powers of observation on social issues. There are some practical views which can be applied in real life situations that I really liked. For instance, Mark's idea of happiness (happiness is a work-in-process, a form of activity, not an emotion), the loop from hell (I'm angry and I'm angry that I'm angry so I'm flooded in my own anger about myself), or commitment gives us more freedom.

After reading the index, I was sure I was going love it but it just didn’t live up to my expectations.I don’t think I found anything particularly life-changing, as it wasn’t anything I haven’t heard before. I get that the book was supposed to be realistic and all but it wasn’t that impressive to me. I came across some useful points and some points that I didn’t agree with. 
Takeaway
:•“The backward law”—the idea that the more you pursue feeling better all the time, the less satisfied you become, as pursuing something only reinforces the fact that you lack it in the first place.•We have to take responsibility for everything that happens in our life, even if it’s not our fault or something out of our control.•Who you are is defined by what you’re willing to struggle for. Managing our struggles leads to lifelong fulfillment and happiness. •Your actions actually don’t matter that much in the grand scheme of things; the vast majority of your life will be boring and not noteworthy, and that’s okay.•What is objectively true about your situation is not as important as how you come to see the situation, how you choose to measure it and value it.•Growth generates happiness, not a long list of arbitrary achievements.•Action isn’t just the effect of motivation; it’s also the cause of it.
Criticism
:The author gives an example of Charles Bukowski who got famous without trying. The chapter itself is named ‘Don’t try’ and he said that self-improvement and success aren’t the same things and all the conventional life advises i.e. the positive stuff is fixating on what you lack. Does this mean I should give up and accept myself the way I am if I know I can get better? Self-improvement might not guarantee success but it guarantees growth and progress, so I don’t think I’ll take this advice. I don’t believe in ‘Be who you are’, but ‘Be the best you can be’ which implies giving your 100% in everything.He says constant positivity is a form of avoidance, not a valid solution to life’s problems. While I agree it’s not a solution but it’s not a form of avoidance. I don’t think it’s possible for people to be positive all the time.But, being positive in a difficult situation is accepting that the situation is bad and approaching it effectively. Having a positive outlook enables you to cope better with stressful situations. It’s having the mindset that things are worse but they’re going to get better. Even I feel better and motivated when I’m thinking optimistically.He criticizes the positivity/consumer culture which tells us to be more accepting and open to possibilities and says that we need to reject things. He mentions the paradox of choice: the more options we’re given, the less satisfied we become with whatever we choose.Well, choosing something is essentially rejecting the alternatives and of course, we need to reject things but we need to know what we are rejecting and what’s good enough to commit to and we won’t know that unless we’re open to possibilities. Being open to possibilities is more about doing things out of your comfort zone. I don’t know who said it but found this quote: “To get something you have never had, you have to do something you’ve never done.” 
Conclusion
:Anyway, that was my interpretation and it was an ok read. It’d be perfect for people who don’t like the annoying positive self-help books; I’m one of those annoying positive people who find positivity uplifting.The author presented some points that are worth reading like the difference between healthy and unhealthy relationship, happiness, entitlement. I’d suggest you read and see for yourself if you like it."
70,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/957634-daniel-clausen,5,"This was a case of the right book at the wrong time for me. Unfortunately, I read this book right after I had finished my own self-help book ""The Underground Novel: An Alternative Guide to Life after Graduation"". I read this book without realizing how similar the two books might be -- the similarity between the voice of this author and my own character's voice was uncanny...That being said, it was an easy, breezy read and embraced many of the things I like in anti-self-help. I enjoyed the nods to stoicism, Buddhism, and sheer common sense. I appreciated the focus on values. For me, the gold in this book came from insights on psychology, specifically the psychology of relationships. I've always wondered why certain people seek out abusive partners. I have some thoughts on the subject cobbled together from my time reading abnormal psychology and Freud. But this was many years ago, and this book was able to present some satisfying answers clearly, and with the confident voice of someone who has been in those types of relationships. For anyone thinking of reading this book, I would recommend you prioritize reading ""Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance."" I think that is a far more essential book. It is also a complicated literary work in ways that ""The Subtle Art"" is not. What I like most about narrative as a form of self-help philosophy is that the author creates layers of meaning that might have multiple, perhaps even contradictory readings. I truly believe that any good self-help book should at some point make the reader puzzle over questions for his or herself. This book was not very subtle. It could at times be very blunt. That's okay too. Blunt is also another way of being honest. And this is an honest attempt to retell simple truths. The most essential is that living based in non-shitty core values is the only life worth living. That's a great message to pass on, no matter how many F-bombs are you used to pass it on. "

“you will never be happy if you continue to search for what happiness consists of”
— overall thoughts: 5.0 — An accessible self-help book that anyone can benefit fromThat was honestly one of the best thing's I've ever read. I just need to say that my notes for this review is 4 screens of my phone long but I'm still not sure if I'll be able to string the right words together to make a comprehensive review without outright ranting. There are just too many messages placed in this crash course of a book, but I guess that's what made it amazing for me. Anyway :) ....the overall message of this book is basically to place your attention on the most true, immediate and important parts of your life.... and something about that just made me feel like a happy little tree 🌲the fact that it wasn't SO serious 100% of the time made me comfortable?? and since I read this as an audiobook it literally felt like a friend was talking to me the whole time. Like my bestfriend giving me advice. It made me open up my mind more, which I think was the point.I can't formulate paragraphs right now so here's a bulleted form of some of what translated into my head:● avoidance in itself is a struggle -> so just solve problems that you enjoy● no one who is actually happy has to convince themselves that they are happy● who you are = what you are willing to struggle for● admit that life just sucks sometimes● EMOTIONS are just FEEDBACK -> you're allowed to be angry at someone but it doesn't justify you punching them ● blaming others hurts you the most
“nobody makes it through life without collecting a few scars on the way out”
some of the most life-changing choices that we are going to be given is simple but it's going be really really hard to choose that. As a service-oriented person (even though they were probably talking about something else) I kind of associated myself with that part saying ""acts of love are only valid if they are done without conditions or expectations"".I needed to hear these words so bad at the point in my life right now and it was just the right words to reassure me. And the words weren't so profound that you need to think so hard to get the message which allows for even a younger audience than the usual self-help book.I was able to relate to it a lot and reminded me that even though we are all different people leading different lives... we all struggle just the same. Acknowledging our mistakes means that we've grown past them.
“the last person I should ever have to censor myself with is the woman I love”
We choose what is enough for us. The book also said this somewhere but I feel like repeating here that it's just saying what we already know but making us face them and saying it straight up.I mean I didn't even think I really needed a self-help book right now so READ THIS!!At the end of the day we are already great people simply because we can CHOOSE what to give a f*** about.thanks for reading my somewhat unfiltered thoughtsFORMAT READ Audiobook (Recommended)READ FOR: accessible self-help book⟹ MY BLOG | SUPPORT ME ON KO-FI ⟸"

But most of what he says seem more like opinions than facts. - He says that a lot of times, things may suck, and that is okay. No matter what we do, we are going to face opposition and resistance, and that is what will train us to be better and stronger.- Sometimes, the content seems to be incoherent, without a proper flow.- The author is self aware and honest.- He compares life to a game of poker, no matter what cards we are dealt with (good/bad), it is ultimately our decisions that decide if we win or lose the game.- ""Do Something"", when a task looks insurmountable, and it feels like everything might be a wreck, do something, maybe the tiniest and the silliest improvement in the state of the task everyday.- The author signifies the importance of death in our lives, and says that we have a physical self, our immediate worries, recent tasks and possessions, and our conceptual self, the impact that we leave when we cease to exist. This was like an eye opener for me, though in an essence I was aware of the idea, the author solidifies it with apt examples."

I pre-ordered this book from some recommendation and forgot about it until it showed up, at which point I had some vague notion of what the book was about. Turned out to be much better than I expected. It covers some really deep insights about making meaning out of one's life, far exceeding what one would expect from someone as young as the author. The writing was really good in a sense that it was colloquial and sophisticated. The numerous anecdotes and references were esoteric (to me) and often surprised me in their conclusions. For most people who have their heads straight (knowing what to say no to, what to focus on, being humble and hard working), this book serves as a great reminder. For those who have not figured it out yet, this is the introduction book to realizing what's important in your life."

It suits my worldview, in a great many ways. It throws self-help and fake positivity crap out the window, and tells you quite overtly that pain is a part of life, that life ain't fair, and that it's all about your effort, so get your act together, asshole. It suits my self-blaming, cynical, critical, perfectionist philosophy.The longer I think about this book, though, the more it leaves a sour sort of taste in my mouth.For one, it doesn't actually do away with guilt. On the contrary, it replaces your guilt of not being the best, of not being great or happy, with the guilt of not living up to the standards of this book. You're now guilty of giving too many fucks, of not being willing to accept pain, of not being strong enough or active enough. The book wants you to want the pain as part of the reward - and that's fine, it is as it should be, but it forgets to give you breathing room because pain is painful, and difficulties are difficult. And no sane person wants pain or difficulty.So, yes, you want the easy way out. You want the results and gratification without the pain of achieving them. Everybody does. Everybody, even those who put in the work, would much prefer to succeed without doing the work. They don't actually like the pain - they're just willing to tolerate it. the book doesn't actually teach you how to accept both the fact that pain is part of gain and the fact that you, as a normal, sane human being, don't like pain and aren't obligated to. The book doesn't teach you to forgive yourself for slipping and to try again. If you fail at something, it's because you ""didn't actually want it"" and that, frankly, is nonsense. I have no fucks to give for that kind of victim-blaming statement.It spends a lot of time talking about entitlement. Entitlement, it is generally recognized, is bad. you ain't entitled to anything, it says. But that, too, is false. Entitlement is bad when it's overextended, when it's out of whack, but entitlement in and of itself is important. Entitlement is the measure of fairness. And we are entitled! we're entitled to a fair chance, we're entitled to an equitable place in life. If we're ill or psychologically damaged we're entitled to help. A person without entitlement is a person without a sense of fairness or justice, and that, believe me, is as psychologically bad as what the book calls ""the entitled asshole"".There is some good advice in this book, and a great deal to like. It tells you to remember that what feels pleasant isn't necessarily good for you, and not to pay too much attention to your emotions, it tells you to prioritize the things you need to care about in life, it tells you that nice is not the ultimate value, and should not be... and it's right. But it's important to take it with the sort of grain of salt with which it seems to have been written, otherwise, I feel, because it also judges you, trivializes what pain and difficulty actually entail, and forgets that the absence of qualities is not actually the opposite of having these qualities - it's the reverse, and that is different."

After reading it, I finally got it why everyone is so obsessed about this book.I personally have read so many self-help books but haven't read anything like this book. Most self-help book will tell you to do yoga, be calm, be happy in all situation, you are special, you are right, be certain, say yes to everything, your soul is eternal and so on. Stuff like this is nice to read but it's not pragmatic, and this book tells exactly opposite of that and still makes you improve your self.In the modern fast-paced life you can't say yes to everything and everyone cause if that's the case people will eat you alive, this book tells you a practical way of living life, what you should give a fuck about and what you should not.This book has changed my entire persona of seeing life. All this book says is to find a bigger fuck to give a fuck about. This book also be able to help you if you are having an existential crisis and give you perspective to look at your problems differently.Millennials like me are not very much into reading a book especially a self-help. But the language of this book is such that millennials would actually love to read it. This book hits number 1 in my top 10 of self-help books.So all and all if you are millennial or not, you're having an existential crisis or not, you like a self-help book or not, you give way to much fuck about everything or not at all, in my opinion, everyone should read this book at least once.Detailed Review Link - http://chevusread.blogspot.com/2018/1..."

There were still some good takeaways and I appreciate the “different” perspective provided to get there.The main message of The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F* is not telling you to DGAF about anything, but to choose what you want to GAF about, based on your own values (not the values you feel socially pressured to accept), and stop worrying about who it angers in the process. Simple, right? I did really enjoy the last chapter which was about confronting your mortality and the legacy you’ll leave behind.

The first chapter is talking about being success is not a guarantee for one’s to be a better person afterwards. Too much-giving f*ck on standards in which followed by a lot of people that success is all about wealth, popular, expensive car and so on. Nevertheless, this book let us no to give a shit to those standards, yet becoming successful does not make us a better person.Mark Manson states that Happiness is a problem, how it can be a problem?. Happiness can make us feel at ease, but Mark Manson view this thing differently. Mark Manson mentioned in his book “life is essentially an endless series of problems”. As long as we live, we are going to face problems. Pretending that we have no problem is a problem. Accepting those unpleasing happen in our life can be the best way to be happy. Mark Manson added on the 3rd chapter of this book that life may throw us sh*t whoever we are. If huge problems happen in our life, that problem may happen to each person in the past few years, or there is someone facing the same problem too. ""This is why not going a fuck is so key. This is why it's going to save the world it by accepting that the world is totally fucked up and that's all right, because it's always been that way, and always be.""Mark Manson expresses his thoughts in straightforward with some of his own experiences. He also added some stories from Charles Bukowski, William James, and Dave Mustaine. Along with analogies he presented in this book can make the reader hum to themself “Yes, I do agree with that”. In a nutshell, this book suits for people who seek for happiness through simplicity in life."

So you must choose your fucks wisely.""There is an incredible amount ""f*cks"" mentioned in Mark Manson's sentences in the first 50 pages. It got on my nerves. Either it lessened afterwards or the content of the book improved to such a degree that a bit of off-putting language didn't bother me anymore. This is a brilliant handbook on how to do well in life. It's in tune with the books on cognitive psychology written by the Norwegian hypocondria doctor Ingvard Wilhelmsen. It also take a case against hedonistic society most of us live in, where we seek pleasure as the ultimate goal and have bad values.""Good values are 1) reality-based, 2) socially constructive, and 3) immediate and controllable. Bad values are 1) superstitious, 2) socially destructive and 3) not immediate or controllable. [...] Some examples of good, healthy values: honesty, innovation, vulnerability, standing up for oneself, standing up for others, self-respect, curiosity, charity, humility, creativity.""Then Mark moves on the importance of feeling pain and having problems. These are necessary aspects for growth. You cannot ever get anywhere without failing. This is a tough one. I hate failing. I hate being wrong, but I work out of the premise that I probably am - meaning it's easier than it could have been. I like many of the problems I have at work because I get a kick out of solving them (but then I get new problems out of the ones I've fixed). A day with nothing to rack my brains on is a boring day. Thankfully, in my line of work, that's about three days a year. Still, messing up sucks. I do it regularly. The only way to not do anything wrong is to do nothing. According to the message from Mark Manson, since I have problems I enjoy solving and feel the still regular pain is worthwhile, I have the ""right"" problems that are aligned with my values and what I give a f*ck about.So this book moves from seeming superficial to actually being quite profound and useful. I've realigned many of my values and thought processes in the past six months. The main insight from the cognitive psychologist Ingvard Wilhelmsen was that thoughts are not facts. They are just thoughts. Not reality. ""The subtle art of not giving a f*uck"" nudges me further in the right direction by giving me the insight that pain and frustration is absolutely necessary aspects of getting anywhere and that I have an unreasonable fear of failure.Since I found this useful, it could be that you would to. I wholeheartedly recommend it, despite my initial reservations."

It’s not so much that I read these style of books and watch endless amounts of Youtube videos on the topic in the search of the elusive and ultimate magical cure for the negative elements of life. I consume all the media available on the topic, instead, as positive background noise to my daily life. I find it soothing to immerse myself in an endless uplifting stream that is hopefully, somewhere, penetrating my psyche with the often repetitive message they all deliver.However, this is a self-improvement book with a difference. I went into it believing the abrasive title would lead to a tough love approach for life delivered inside. To an extent, it does. It also does so much more. It really does teach us how to stop giving a fuck!This book negates that we are all special little snowflakes and that our suffering means something. It groups humans together into an endless cycle of individuals who are born and die and most get to mean nothing along the way. Instead of this becoming a depressing ideology, Manson’s dry humour alleviates the nature of the contents and his explanations allow the reader to understand the freedom that lies in this way of thinking.It forces us to confront and understand negative cycles of thinking that our upbringing and the society we reside in promote. Often, these are cycles we are completely unaware of. Often, they are honed through very early childhood experiences or the cycles that our guardians are themselves trapped inside of.By not alleviating our suffering to some sort of holy plane, it does not romance or justify it. It can be hard to believe that no majestic view is granted to us, as we struggle over the final hurdle in our mountain of oppression. This view is there, but it is only granted to the hustlers, and not as a reward for all those who suffer, which is all of us, no matter what our psyches have been brainwashed to believe.My review does not begin to scratch the surface for all the multitude of truth this book delivers. There was no dense scientific backing and Manson’s conversational tone was retained throughout. For me, that only made it all the harder to negate what knowledge was imparted as it seems like this contained only common sense, but common sense that society has hidden from us."

Sadly, the word f*ck (which is my fav curse word when used sparingly and with great timing for comic effect in RL) is used so much that the book becomes hard to read. The author makes some good points (though these same points have been made by Buddha,Confucius, Plato, Proust, etc), but there's bad mixed in. Stuff like how the 80 yo woman has nothing to care about but grocery coupons. My Great Aunt Jessie is eighty-eight, lives alone, volunteered to call people for the DNC last election, etc. She'd have a lot to say about someone assuming old means nothing left to care about.I did notice that I have come to some of the same conclusions as the author. He's ahead of the game on some of the things that I had to reach fifty to realize on my own. He's right that you have to pick what you are going to care and not care about. Idk. There's treasure in this book to be mined. I just think there are, for me at least, better and more accessible philosophy & happy life books elsewhere. Besides, this author acts like when you reach eighty, you might as well disappear as you have nothing to live for anymore which is insane and erroneous. "

Two classes a week and you get to hear this faculty who didn't know what he was doing and had a hard time enunciating Sigmund Freud. If it was just another dummy course which ends with an exam where I could've written all the crap in the world it wouldn't have mattered much. But faculty was apparently an innovative person and he came up with an idea where you present a theory (or whatever) for thirty minutes and he fills the lab marks. I'd ripped this book into a 25 slide-d ppt with a title called 'Optimistic Nihilism for Millenials' with all the images of Beatles and Megadeth. So when I was all done, he smirked like villains in black and white Hollywood movies do, and brushed me off. I got a D grade. End of the story. It irked me for a while. It shouldn't have. That's the whole point of the book. "

Literally each and every paragraph is filled with so much wisdom, no bullshit, straight up, to the point wisdom. It's a book that I want to read over and over and over again to remind myself of it's principles. One of my favorite principles is that we can't give a f about everything, we have to be careful about what f's to give, and how many. I didn't even write notes for this book because there would be so many... next time I read it I'll make nicely condensed notes lol "

Also, it's so of this time with all the fucks that are given. The concept of this book is something I've been applying to my life for a while, but not in the extend that the book goes to. Reading on a deeper level about this subject was insightful, and I'm going to apply points from the book to my life. "
