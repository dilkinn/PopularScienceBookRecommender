0,0156027771,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5918205-rick-ludwig,5,"This book is what introduced me to the world of medical research. After reading it in 1963, I decided this is how I wanted to spend my life. The writing is probably dated now, but the way it captured the excitement of research discoveries convinced me to pursue this as a career. I'm almost 61 years old now and retired, but I spent over 35 years of my life pursuing this career and never regretted it.The book discusses the giants of germ theory and does so in a way that makes these scientists approachable as real men with real emotions. It must have been a groundbreaking book when it first came out in the 1920s. It is amazing how many researches and physicians from my generation read and were impacted by this book.Why am I reviewing it now? I referred to it in a novel I am writing and realized how important the book was to me. For this reason I read it again. And guess what? I still enjoyed every chapter. THe author made these scientists real and flawed and eccentric without diminishing the impact of their work. The introduction to the newest edition, published in the 1990s, didn't try to bring us completely up-to-date- on microbiology, which would have been impossible. What it did was remind us how important the identification of causative agents and development of treatments for infectious disease remains. The unique aspect of this book is that it took an honest snapshot of where things stood in 1926. There is language that is demeaning for minorities, but minorities were demeaned then. Wrong headed, but honest. The idea of science as a gradual unravelling of underlying truths is clearly there as is the potential of one negative experiment to bring a logically developed theory to grief. The distinction between a Scientist who tries to discover and one who tries to make discoveries fit a pre determent theory is also well developed. As a lifetime scientist who was first tempted to pursue my career when I read this book, I am glad it can still remind me that I made the right choice."

It is fascinating how much you can learn from something so little. This book came to me thanks to my fist Microbiology class “General Microbiology” which was my favorite. It is a simple book with all the mayor microbiology discovers, told in a very light and interesting way. This fucking geniuses feel like real people. I swear it will be not just educational for you but also very interesting. No recuerdo porque jamás lo leí por completo, pero en el momento en que vi ese reto del Challenge me dije que lo leería. Y aquí estoy. No hay mucho que decir, es la historia de la microbiología contada de forma amena. Lo recomiendo muchísimo sobretodo si estas en alguna clase primeriza de la materia. De verdad te ayudara a recordar situaciones o fechas que un maestro quiere que aprendas y hasta te sacara una que otra risotada. Cazadores de Microbios es un must para cualquiera con pasión por esa ciencia."
2,0156027771,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1171690-stan-paulsen,5,"Imagine, in the 18th century, the first human being on earth to look through his crude, home made microscope at a living microbe. Those that followed him figured out that it was these wee beasties that made us sick and even die by the millions. Late in the 19th century, Louis Pasteur figured out ways to kill bacteria in livestock, wine and beer, and ultimately humans. Imagine comforting a grieving mother hysterical about her baby dying of diphtheria with a cure! Not just comforting words as her baby turned blue and drown with lungs full of liquid. Anthrax, plague, malaria, yellow fever, tuberculosis, cholera and many other disease causing microbes were identified. They were the first to figure out it was mosquitoes and ticks or even just drinking water that passed the microbes along. These early pioneers in microbe hunting, and those that followed, have done more to relieve gratuitous human suffering than any to walk the earth before them. Simply knowing to wash hands, boil drinking water and stay away from mosquito bites improved the human condition immeasurably. I solute them and their tireless, self sacrificing and endless scientific work to discover the workings of the microbe."
3,0156027771,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5920956-amelia-elena,5,I've read this book when I was 16 and later when I was 23. I guess it shaped my life. It is maybe why I work today with the miniature world of microorganisms.
4,0156027771,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1226061-greg,5,"I put off reading this for so long because, really, it looked so boring! I tell you now, in all seriousness, this is the best book about science I have ever read. And, it was written in the 1920s! Seriously, I would actually use the word ""swashbuckling"" to describe this tale of scientists hunting for microbes. Great characters, good story, excellent writing. Highly recommended!"
5,0156027771,http://goodreads.com/user/show/413153-sara,4,"A really engaging read about the people who pioneered the field of microbiology. I particularly enjoyed the first part, about Leeuwenhoek, the section on Koch, and the section about Theobold Smith. Now I know about for whom Walter Reed hospital was named and why. It was eye opening to read about the vast numbers of guinea pigs and other animals (and the human cases—those brave souls in Cuba) that met miserable fates in the name of science. There are some demeaning comments towards minorities, reflecting the time period when this book was written. Despite that, I’m glad I read it. Quite inspiring, really."
6,0156027771,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21706824-samantha-fuller,5,"Potential readers need to know right away that this book is close to 100 years old, the ONLY reason this matters is that some of the language and the style of the writing was of its time. Terms for peoples and countries have changed, don't be put off. Despite this I can see why this book remains in print. It is fantastic history story telling long before ""Horrible Histories"" reinvented the genre. This book is unafraid and indeed revels in the wild characters that populated the microbiology niche. It is not quite a thriller, but does read like a fiction. The characters, their actual process and what techniques needed mastering just to even study microbes is all very clearly explained with great colourful description. The egos, the battles and national politics going alongside are all part of the fantastic breadth of this book. I can't understand why it is not on every school reading list. I've read that many of the great modern virologists and immunologists say this book was the first introduction that really made them curious as school boys and girls. This book is the primer for all further reading in microbes, disease etc. in my view. Reader need not have any science background to understand and appreciate this book. The book is divided into chapters based on each major character. The achievements of each person are clearly articulated and linked across time so that you get the appreciation of how modern scientists are always standing on shoulders of those before. OR when we forget and don't save history or read history, this too is highlighted when science must start again. So the scientific methodology is clearly supported and explained many times through out. This is again why I think it should be on every school curriculum before students move on to dry, more formal books.Excellent book, brought to my attention by my father who remembered it from his childhood days. I am embarking in middle life a career shift into science from business, so he thought it was good primer and inspiration. He was utterly correct. Books are always amazing gifts and can prove transformational - this is one of them."
7,0156027771,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4486738-molly,2,"FINALLY worked my way through this one! Not sure why I got so bogged down towards the end. Maybe it had something to do with all the action moving to Africa and the very of-the-times but still awkward for a modern person to read racism kicked in? Nothing outright awful just terminology and tone, but still weird for me. Mostly though it was interesting to read about microbiology in the days before DNA discovery, which now plays such a huge role in ALL biology. And impressive how much work they could do with viruses without being able to see them."
8,0156027771,http://goodreads.com/user/show/220675-matt-cline,4,"Interesting account written in the 1920s prose in which the whole world is filled with wonder and a frank account of the harsher realities. I love how lots of people gladly volunteered their lives in a gamble for a cure; not sure a) nanny government would LET you and b) if perfectly healthy people would subject themselves to same torment. I also enjoyed seeing the retelling, if to be believed, of these peoples' lives -- such strong personalities. "
9,0156027771,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63133807-john,3,"Fascinating tale of the microbe hunters focusing on their many failures and few successes. de Kruif brings to life the characters who despite many obstacles succeeded where so many others gave up. The writing style is unique to its time, but the story is an eternal tale of man's striving to understand the workings of the invisible world all around us. As a prelude to the modern study of Genetics, this work amplifies the many challenges inherent in seeing and understanding very tiny beings and their impact on mankind. "
10,0156027771,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3890573-emma-hinkle,4,Great book about the pioneers of Microbiology. The writing style is very refreshing and light hearted and praises the countless hours these men spent researching. It's an encouraging book to read as a scientist and see how many failures these men had to go through before triumphing.
11,0156027771,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2467576-tam-g,3,"This a tough one for me to rank. The author has that wonderful chatty style so loved and familiar at the birth of the 20th century. It is a beautiful thing. Amusing. Descriptive. Honest. Where heroes have crackpot ideas as often as good ones and are often full-of-themselves or paranoid or manic-depressive or of dubious moral character. Of course, this *was* written in the early 20th century, and contains all of the social prejudices of that time. You'll see it right off (""ni**er in the woodpile"") and you'll be taken aback and maybe put it away for awhile and then take it back out and say to yourself, 'see, it's just an anachronism and its gone now, keep reading.' Then you get to the malaria chapter with its myriad of outdated, and now-offensive, descriptors of the native population when none are necessary to the story. So here I am at the end thinking about inherent racism, sexism, and moral ambiguity of medicine and history. In some ways that is a good thing. In other ways I just want to live in that fun, light style and not have to think about all of those difficult subjects. So 3 stars? 4? It's a tough one. I think I'd give him 4 if it was intentional. I don't think it was intentional. But should I judge him for where society was when he wrote it? Some I can look at objectively, but the malaria/Africa chapter was bad form all around. Mild racism made much more icky because he was so playful about it. And then to follow up with human experimentation just left me feeling less fun and a bit skeeved. "
12,0156027771,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5923499-renae,3,"Omg, this took me ages to get through, I had to dally with two other books as reprieve from this. Listen, this book started off really interesting and nichey for me. But it was written in 1925, so basically it was the story of the first people who used microscopes to learn about germs. But I guess I was expecting it to cover more modern stuff, not realising how old this was. Don’t get me wrong, I enjoyed the subject matter especially the stuff about Leeuwenhoek, he seems like my sorta person. I guess I got bored with the long windedness of it after a while and the talk about the every day goings on of these people or who they wrote to etc. I just wanted the science, cold hard science! Lol and frankly most of this stuff was, lets just kill animals until I can find something by trial and error that works. Even the author from 1925 said it was unscientific. I suppose we needed interest to develop the technology to further science, from the clumsy animal maiming into a more exact practice. I think I need to read microbial biology or virology or some sort of genetics for dummies book now to get some of the satisfaction I missed in this read. If anyone has any suggestions, put them in the replies. "
13,0156027771,http://goodreads.com/user/show/166376-david,4,"Written in 1926, this is a classic collection of essays about the pioneers of microbiology. Beginning with Leeuwenhoek, with chapters on Pasteur (x2), Koch, through Bruce, Walter Reed and Paul Ehrlich, the essays span the time period from 1650 to 1910. De Kruif writes with an infectious enthusiasm and a strong narrative drive, so that the essays hold up remarkably well - one is swept up in the story. What is particularly impressive is his ability to set each researcher's accomplishments squarely within the context of what was known at the time.Warning: sometimes the language is archaic (Paul Ehrlich is described repeatedly as a 'gay man'), sometimes it goes way over the threshold of political correctness ('darky assistants'). However, retrospective application of current norms of political correctness would be both unfair and pointless. Best to make allowances for the time at which these essays were written, find a comfortable chair and lose oneself in the excitement of the stories of these extraordinary scientists."
14,0156027771,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76129604-ce,2,"I wanted to like this book, especially in the beginning.The author makes racist remarks about black, Asian, Indian, Cuban, Jewish, Spanish and other people that get more frequent as the book goes on. And they get more hate-filled, claiming people are less than human and have no right to have emotions.My copy is from the 1954. I was really disappointed to read online that the newer edition retains all the racist crap. It adds nothing to the “historical” aspect of the people de Kruif is writing about. The only person it speaks about is him. I understand that some words may not have been offensive at the time, just like ‘gay’ meant happy. But not the majority. Just because many other white Europeans/Americans felt that way then doesn’t make it ok. It makes his accuracy seriously questionable especially in the last chapter. He acts as if Paul Ehrlich did almost nothing, but suggest weird ideas and secure money and means. Then why focus on him? Why isn’t he a side note in Berthein’s accomplishment?"
15,0156027771,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56764745-nina,4,"Easily the most entertaining book on microbiology I've ever read. Which isn't too hard, because I've only read textbooks until now. Fun read if you want to learn more about the science of bacteria and viruses."
16,0156027771,http://goodreads.com/user/show/611813-melinda,4,"A really lovely book, enjoyable to read. Puts real faces on the people who have been pioneers and discoverers of amazing things. The thing I found so refreshing is that most of these pioneers were bound to ""discover"" and investigate regardless of what other people thought. They didn't need prior examples to encourage them, they were doggedly curious and searched and experimented because they wanted to. In an age of ""you must have a role model"", I find these fellows amazingly unique and encouraging!"
17,0156027771,http://goodreads.com/user/show/974210-erik-graff,4,"This was one of the books at grandmother's cottage in SW Michigan which I read up there one summer a couple of years before entering high school and taking my first real biology course. Basically, it consists of twelve inspiring biographies about the founders of microbiology. I was certainly inspired. Reading the book made me think about becoming something other than an astronomer or cosmologist."
18,0156027771,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1821388-stacey,0,"This begins as a charming children's book, but after a while it reveals itself to be a viciously racist children's book. I picked it up thinking it would be a fun global pandemic read--because they solve the problem, they cure the ills--but it was too offensive to the humans of the world to actually enjoy. "
19,0156027771,http://goodreads.com/user/show/714546-shirley-kingery,1,"One of the worst books I have ever read, and I have read alot of books and consider myself a decent judge of them. There are not very many people this guy fails to offend or belittle in this diatribe."
20,0156027771,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31656053-victor-davis,3,"A book so badly written, it's actually insanely entertaining! A peek inside the cultural norms of 1926, in all its sexist and racist glory.Having said that, I'm not familiar with any other book (at least well known) with this overall premise: An historical review of the discovery of microbes, starting with Leeuwenhoek finding little ""animalcules"" in raindrops, all the way to the present. Every step of the way involved new challenges for the researchers involved.Tuberculosis was the first disease shown to be caused by microbes, a really weird concept at the time. Think of it. In a world where disease was thought to be a curse wrought upon a city as vengeance for sin--think A Journal of the Plague Year--the idea that it was actually caused by tiny animals from ""the sub-visible world"" living in your body was downright laughable.Diphtheria tripped up scientists because it's not actually the bacteria that kills you, its the toxins they give off, confounding standard experiments.African Sleeping Sickness has a one hundred percent mortality rate. I did not even know that was possible.Yellow Fever infects humans only, ruling out the standard protocol of experimenting on lab animals. So the researchers used themselves as human guinea pigs, experiencing the 30% mortality rate themselves, then calling for US Army volunteers in a mind-blowing show of patriotism to put that disease to bed forever.I could go on. The author does a wonderful job keeping the reader engaged and the book is structured well, associating chapter-disease-scientist in neat packets and staying out of the weeds, sticking to narrative. Every ""jump"" from one discovery to the next involved a new wrinkle or new fundamental discovery, like that of a ""vector"" the idea that disease could be spread from mammal to mammal via an insect, another mind-blower of the time.If there is another, more modern book, that covers this kind of material, I am all ears. I'd love to be able to de-recommend this one, but fact is, I learned so much and was wowed every chapter by pure science story."
21,0156027771,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4851109-heng,5,"I picked up a used copy online because somebody recommended it as a classic. Turns out that copy was owned by a middle school. It is a good sign that schools approve of this book. It is a bad sign that nobody checked this copy out. It was fitting that I make up for my lack of exposure to school books. One has to smile at the exuberant way of writing. On one hand, it makes the scientific part less dull. On the other hand, it makes you wonder how much of it was an exaggeration and how much was indeed realistic. On the scientific part, the book did a good job describing how the experimental controls worked in each of the discoveries. The author honed a concept to a very sharp point and then presented the correct experiment to illustrate how the concept was proven or dis-proven. This alone is well worth the book's status as a middle school classics. Microbiology has come a long way since the book's first publication. I am glad that it is reprinted still. The next question is how to get our middle/high school students to read it. "
22,0156027771,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28820884-nick,4,"why have I never herd of this!! the title grabbed me (title buyer). this was publish in 1920 (my copy is from the 50s) which both got me a litttle teary eyed with joy. plus it has a signature inside, also a label with him an his wife’s home address, along with a stamped school name (possibly this guys) that is a school for gifted learners, intriguing. the description on the book sounds enticing. this could of been horrendous or amazing, I had to find out.“A wonderful book. It is a hunting story as interesting as any story of African game hunters, or tiger hunters in Asia..this book is for those who love high adventure, who delight in clear, brave writing, and stirring narrative - emporia gazette.” I couldn’t say it better. Plus it’s a bit funny. slightly reminds me of Sherlock Holmes.though I was expecting it to be sci-fi not science, as wear I found it."
23,0156027771,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49735059-adam,5,"When there are weeks, months, and even years of diligent work with little if any revelations of progress, it is truly astounding that these researchers endured to make such great discoveries. Highly recommended for anyone going into research or interested in graduate school. Personally, the continuous struggles while researching microbes as a grad student at times can make me want to leave the lab and never go back, but this book reiterates what I’ve been lectured - the struggle is part of the process, and sometimes the greatest discoveries are at first what seem like terrible mistakes.Getting to know the characters that set a foundation for future microbe hunters is an enjoyable and surprisingly humorous read."
24,0156027771,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13661261-robin-winter,5,"This book belongs in every reader's education. Passionate, tumbling, full of the excitement and human cost of science, Paul de Kruif brings the scientists of infectious disease to life, foibles as well as intellect. Clear, perhaps simplistic, I cannot imagine a better introduction to the subject. More than that, I have re-read this volume countless times, including days when it was not in my plans, but I made the error of taking it off the shelf and being caught up in de Kruif's almost childlike enthusiasm and delight. I first read this as a ten-year old, but my pleasure in it has hardly diminished in adulthood. Paul de Kruif knows how to tell stories."
25,0156027771,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31496498-layla,5,"so... I have basically never written a review before. But this book is so good I just had to write one. It was given to me by a scientist and I didn't think much of it until I started reading it. I read it in one go. and although I enjoy reading non-fiction books they tend not to be books I can't put aside. This author somehow makes it seem as though he is just telling you a story, as if he is just beside you talking to you. This book encouraged me even more to go into medical research.I recommend this book to anyone who has any remote interest in science and medicine"
26,0156027771,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72623806-nicholle,1,"Started this book based on the recommendation of a very good science writer. Just couldn't get into it, so I returned it to the library. I understand why this is considered a good novel for aspiring science writers to read, but I couldn't get past the fluffy embellishments added to the story. I'm too logical and analytical and if I want to read fluffy embellishment, I'll read a good hard science fiction novel from the minds of Weir or Morris. Hopefully this doesn't impact my ability to become a science writer... "
27,0156027771,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49593410-forintos-attila,5,"I mean.. I am not planning to become a microbiologist, but if there was a book which could convince me, this would certainly be it. Mr. de Kruif describes the era-defining microbiologists of the 19th century with such delightful enthusiasm, it'd be hard to resist joining in with his enthusiasm.Although nearing it's 100th birthday I should say that neither the language nor its 'factfulness' seems to impose any barrier into enjoying this wonderful book. Alas some concepts and ideologies might trigger some uncomfortable twitches in us- for instance the way the writer speaks about people of colour is rather horrific to hear for someone today.Overall great read with such enthusiasm which overshadows its mistakes and ancientness."
28,0156027771,http://goodreads.com/user/show/97874475-totol-bookhoarderiv,5,"I finished my degree in Microbiology and I vowed never to do anything related to the subject. I was done with it. I picked up this book in a second hand bookstore. I realised none of my professors had ever mentioned this book which is an amazing tragedy because this should be compulsary reading for anyone with even a passing interest in microbiology. It shows a completely different side to the droll, neverending names that you have to memorize in class. I'm starting to realise, some of my favourite books have been found while browsing in a second hand bookstore:)"
29,0156027771,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1681831-carolyn,4,"Written in older style story form, this gave an enlightening overview of the advances in the study of microbes over the centuries. Crazy small stuff that affects our ability to survive on earth. Crazy that no one even knew they existed for so long. Illustrates how science is always gaining in knowledge and that it's never done. (And there's not a point where we should halt further examination, making ad hominem attacks rather than reexamining conclusions.) God's creations are incredible!"

It is about the early scientists who discovered microbes and bacteria and, sometimes, the way to combat the power of those microbes. The science part was fascinating. The writing was different. The book was written in 1926 and had a dramatic, even florid style, that sometimes (unintentionally, I'm sure) made us laugh out loud."

I do not know if de Kruif was a racist man, but a lot of the remarks in that chapter (the David Bruce one) just didn't sit right with me and made me more than a little uncomfortable. There are certainly some racial overtones that just remind you that this book was written in the 1920s."

49,0156027771,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7440243-juliana,4,"Microbe Hunters was an interesting book. However I must say is only an introduction to the beginning of microbiology ideal for people that do not have any scientific background/education in the topic. My edition was from the 40’s so it was considerably older than the editions shown in Goodreads. The prose and the way it was written were beautiful; it was a pleasant surprise to find out (as a non-native English speaker) that English can be written in such a way. I do not know if the newer editions conserve this style and some people consider it out-dated but to me it made the book even more interesting. The only objection I have with this book in terms of vocabulary is the frequent use of racist words and expressions that are no longer accepted. I know that in the 20’s people were allowed to use them but I felt quite uncomfortable while reading those passages, it also decreased my admiration for the author, but that is just my personal opinion. I do wonder if the newer editions corrected those words. The first half of the book kept me reading without wanting to put the book down. Towards the middle and end of the book it got a bit boring but the very las chapter was for me one of the best. First and last stories were the best. I guess that is a good way to organize a book. I highly recommend this book for people interested in understanding how we got to discover that fascinating world of microorganisms. Also, as a scientist in training, it was especially motivating to see how much struggle science had in those days and it still does now. Seeing how perseverant those people were and that failure also led to success definitely helped me to see the “big picture” of what doing research means. "
50,0156027771,http://goodreads.com/user/show/273793-mark,4,"A story of the discovery and research of microbes as known in 1926. The book is great in showing how real science happens. It describes the mind numbing effort of countless experiments done on the way to support the few moments of insight (more often guesses) to figure out how things work. Every chapter focuses on a main scientist who is never some bland geek in a lab coat but who is always a living, breathing, quirky, often cantankerous individual. The scientific establishment is also clearly not a monolithic institution of perfection but a bunch of quarreling men each arguing for their own theories.The book is written in the breathless style you would expect more of something titled ""Great Science Adventures for Boys"". This is considerably different than the more mainstream tone of today's science popularizations. It makes for easy reading and is mildly entertaining.The book is written in 1926 and, as a friend put it, partakes of the ""background racism and sexism of the time"". Nothing shocking, just enough to make one glad to be living now instead of them. Also, you know the phrase ""No animal was harmed in the making of this movie."" Not the case here. If animal experimentation really bothers you, this is not the book for you."
51,0156027771,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1653748-dilly-dalley,4,"I am one of those readers who Bill Bryson appealed to in the 'Short History of Nearly Everything' when he wrote that he wanted to engender the 'wow' response when hearing aspects of scientific discovery. It can be a challenge to write with enough information to convey a complex idea, but not so much academic rigour that it repels the less expert reader. Paul De Kruif in the Microbe Hunters certainly manages to write an appealing scientific book. It has been in print since 1926, which is no mean feat. I enjoyed reading this and enjoyed that he wrote about the scientists, their temperaments and social histories as much as he wrote about the science. After a while though I began to miss the footnotes and references and I sometimes found myself thinking 'how would he know that?'. He makes some interesting statements about the scientists such as:Now, while Paul Ehrlich's head was an encylopedia of chemical knowledge, his hands were not the hands of an expert chemist. He hated complicated apparatus as much as he loved complicated theories. p336 How did Paul De Kruif know what Ehrlich hated? Not a big deal maybe because I did learn quite a bit about the history of microbiology and the early discoveries of these scientists and it read like a ripping yarn."
52,0156027771,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1081475-jessie,3,"As with many non-fiction books written many years ago, this book can be many things to today's readers. For once, it gives you an idea of the excitement that ran through the field of microbiology. From the first man to see bacteria through a microscope to scientists from the early 20th century who developed vaccines without even knowing what the disease *was*, Paul de Kruif chases the history of microbiology. It is exciting and inspiring, while also revealing the (potentially) true characters of the many microbe hunters who started the battle against disease that is still waged today.I think the downside of this book is the same thing that extends some of it's charm. The out of date writing. Yes, I know I can't blame an author for writing like it was 1929 when it was 1929, but it drove me a bit crazy how the author kept putting words in scientist's mouths. Literally. He would quote something that I really doubt (although I guess you never know) was actually recorded in a quotable way. And he kept referring to bacteria as ""little beaties"". It was endearing at first, but as the book goes on, it gets a bit old."

And the occasional little gem like, ""Was even one human life worth it, even the life of a Spanish immigrant?"" Hard to say if immigrants were given less respect than women in this book though.Amounted to about half a dozen short biographies. Some more interesting than others. Some covered a bit of a discoverer's personal lives, others strictly their professional. Unfortunately, just a few days after finishing a chapter on what so-and-so did for the cause of microbe discovery, I was already forgetting details. They all tended to blend in together to me.

109,0156027771,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7440243-juliana,4,"Microbe Hunters was an interesting book. However I must say is only an introduction to the beginning of microbiology ideal for people that do not have any scientific background/education in the topic. My edition was from the 40’s so it was considerably older than the editions shown in Goodreads. The prose and the way it was written were beautiful; it was a pleasant surprise to find out (as a non-native English speaker) that English can be written in such a way. I do not know if the newer editions conserve this style and some people consider it out-dated but to me it made the book even more interesting. The only objection I have with this book in terms of vocabulary is the frequent use of racist words and expressions that are no longer accepted. I know that in the 20’s people were allowed to use them but I felt quite uncomfortable while reading those passages, it also decreased my admiration for the author, but that is just my personal opinion. I do wonder if the newer editions corrected those words. The first half of the book kept me reading without wanting to put the book down. Towards the middle and end of the book it got a bit boring but the very las chapter was for me one of the best. First and last stories were the best. I guess that is a good way to organize a book. I highly recommend this book for people interested in understanding how we got to discover that fascinating world of microorganisms. Also, as a scientist in training, it was especially motivating to see how much struggle science had in those days and it still does now. Seeing how perseverant those people were and that failure also led to success definitely helped me to see the “big picture” of what doing research means. "
110,0156027771,http://goodreads.com/user/show/273793-mark,4,"A story of the discovery and research of microbes as known in 1926. The book is great in showing how real science happens. It describes the mind numbing effort of countless experiments done on the way to support the few moments of insight (more often guesses) to figure out how things work. Every chapter focuses on a main scientist who is never some bland geek in a lab coat but who is always a living, breathing, quirky, often cantankerous individual. The scientific establishment is also clearly not a monolithic institution of perfection but a bunch of quarreling men each arguing for their own theories.The book is written in the breathless style you would expect more of something titled ""Great Science Adventures for Boys"". This is considerably different than the more mainstream tone of today's science popularizations. It makes for easy reading and is mildly entertaining.The book is written in 1926 and, as a friend put it, partakes of the ""background racism and sexism of the time"". Nothing shocking, just enough to make one glad to be living now instead of them. Also, you know the phrase ""No animal was harmed in the making of this movie."" Not the case here. If animal experimentation really bothers you, this is not the book for you."
111,0156027771,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1653748-dilly-dalley,4,"I am one of those readers who Bill Bryson appealed to in the 'Short History of Nearly Everything' when he wrote that he wanted to engender the 'wow' response when hearing aspects of scientific discovery. It can be a challenge to write with enough information to convey a complex idea, but not so much academic rigour that it repels the less expert reader. Paul De Kruif in the Microbe Hunters certainly manages to write an appealing scientific book. It has been in print since 1926, which is no mean feat. I enjoyed reading this and enjoyed that he wrote about the scientists, their temperaments and social histories as much as he wrote about the science. After a while though I began to miss the footnotes and references and I sometimes found myself thinking 'how would he know that?'. He makes some interesting statements about the scientists such as:Now, while Paul Ehrlich's head was an encylopedia of chemical knowledge, his hands were not the hands of an expert chemist. He hated complicated apparatus as much as he loved complicated theories. p336 How did Paul De Kruif know what Ehrlich hated? Not a big deal maybe because I did learn quite a bit about the history of microbiology and the early discoveries of these scientists and it read like a ripping yarn."
112,0156027771,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1081475-jessie,3,"As with many non-fiction books written many years ago, this book can be many things to today's readers. For once, it gives you an idea of the excitement that ran through the field of microbiology. From the first man to see bacteria through a microscope to scientists from the early 20th century who developed vaccines without even knowing what the disease *was*, Paul de Kruif chases the history of microbiology. It is exciting and inspiring, while also revealing the (potentially) true characters of the many microbe hunters who started the battle against disease that is still waged today.I think the downside of this book is the same thing that extends some of it's charm. The out of date writing. Yes, I know I can't blame an author for writing like it was 1929 when it was 1929, but it drove me a bit crazy how the author kept putting words in scientist's mouths. Literally. He would quote something that I really doubt (although I guess you never know) was actually recorded in a quotable way. And he kept referring to bacteria as ""little beaties"". It was endearing at first, but as the book goes on, it gets a bit old."

And the occasional little gem like, ""Was even one human life worth it, even the life of a Spanish immigrant?"" Hard to say if immigrants were given less respect than women in this book though.Amounted to about half a dozen short biographies. Some more interesting than others. Some covered a bit of a discoverer's personal lives, others strictly their professional. Unfortunately, just a few days after finishing a chapter on what so-and-so did for the cause of microbe discovery, I was already forgetting details. They all tended to blend in together to me.

It brings to life the research and discoveries of at least at least a dozen microbe hunters, including Pasteur, Leeuwenhoeck, and Koch. I highly recommend it.

This book begins in 1632 with the birth of Leeuwenhoek and follows the research of some men you've heard of (Pasteur, Reed) and some you probably haven't (Metchnikoff, Bruce). All were doggedly determined to track down their prey and put their own lives at risk to do so. The author writes in a very dramatic way, as if to emphasize the passion of these scientists. I appreciated his inclusion of the mention of several faithful wives who were excellent help-meets in their husbands' endeavors."

I recommend this book for anyone going into or teaching biology. It is an enjoyable and readable narrative of some of the great names in scientific discovery.

169,0156027771,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7440243-juliana,4,"Microbe Hunters was an interesting book. However I must say is only an introduction to the beginning of microbiology ideal for people that do not have any scientific background/education in the topic. My edition was from the 40’s so it was considerably older than the editions shown in Goodreads. The prose and the way it was written were beautiful; it was a pleasant surprise to find out (as a non-native English speaker) that English can be written in such a way. I do not know if the newer editions conserve this style and some people consider it out-dated but to me it made the book even more interesting. The only objection I have with this book in terms of vocabulary is the frequent use of racist words and expressions that are no longer accepted. I know that in the 20’s people were allowed to use them but I felt quite uncomfortable while reading those passages, it also decreased my admiration for the author, but that is just my personal opinion. I do wonder if the newer editions corrected those words. The first half of the book kept me reading without wanting to put the book down. Towards the middle and end of the book it got a bit boring but the very las chapter was for me one of the best. First and last stories were the best. I guess that is a good way to organize a book. I highly recommend this book for people interested in understanding how we got to discover that fascinating world of microorganisms. Also, as a scientist in training, it was especially motivating to see how much struggle science had in those days and it still does now. Seeing how perseverant those people were and that failure also led to success definitely helped me to see the “big picture” of what doing research means. "
170,0156027771,http://goodreads.com/user/show/273793-mark,4,"A story of the discovery and research of microbes as known in 1926. The book is great in showing how real science happens. It describes the mind numbing effort of countless experiments done on the way to support the few moments of insight (more often guesses) to figure out how things work. Every chapter focuses on a main scientist who is never some bland geek in a lab coat but who is always a living, breathing, quirky, often cantankerous individual. The scientific establishment is also clearly not a monolithic institution of perfection but a bunch of quarreling men each arguing for their own theories.The book is written in the breathless style you would expect more of something titled ""Great Science Adventures for Boys"". This is considerably different than the more mainstream tone of today's science popularizations. It makes for easy reading and is mildly entertaining.The book is written in 1926 and, as a friend put it, partakes of the ""background racism and sexism of the time"". Nothing shocking, just enough to make one glad to be living now instead of them. Also, you know the phrase ""No animal was harmed in the making of this movie."" Not the case here. If animal experimentation really bothers you, this is not the book for you."
171,0156027771,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1653748-dilly-dalley,4,"I am one of those readers who Bill Bryson appealed to in the 'Short History of Nearly Everything' when he wrote that he wanted to engender the 'wow' response when hearing aspects of scientific discovery. It can be a challenge to write with enough information to convey a complex idea, but not so much academic rigour that it repels the less expert reader. Paul De Kruif in the Microbe Hunters certainly manages to write an appealing scientific book. It has been in print since 1926, which is no mean feat. I enjoyed reading this and enjoyed that he wrote about the scientists, their temperaments and social histories as much as he wrote about the science. After a while though I began to miss the footnotes and references and I sometimes found myself thinking 'how would he know that?'. He makes some interesting statements about the scientists such as:Now, while Paul Ehrlich's head was an encylopedia of chemical knowledge, his hands were not the hands of an expert chemist. He hated complicated apparatus as much as he loved complicated theories. p336 How did Paul De Kruif know what Ehrlich hated? Not a big deal maybe because I did learn quite a bit about the history of microbiology and the early discoveries of these scientists and it read like a ripping yarn."

For once, it gives you an idea of the excitement that ran through the field of microbiology. From the first man to see bacteria through a microscope to scientists from the early 20th century who developed vaccines without even knowing what the disease *was*, Paul de Kruif chases the history of microbiology. It is exciting and inspiring, while also revealing the (potentially) true characters of the many microbe hunters who started the battle against disease that is still waged today.I think the downside of this book is the same thing that extends some of it's charm. The out of date writing. Yes, I know I can't blame an author for writing like it was 1929 when it was 1929, but it drove me a bit crazy how the author kept putting words in scientist's mouths. Literally. He would quote something that I really doubt (although I guess you never know) was actually recorded in a quotable way. And he kept referring to bacteria as ""little beaties"". It was endearing at first, but as the book goes on, it gets a bit old."
173,0156027771,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2131722-kevin,3,"A book for the geeky community that can handle a few old fashioned phrases and attitudes while reading about a history of some of the most important figures in the discovery of microbes.

And the occasional little gem like, ""Was even one human life worth it, even the life of a Spanish immigrant?"" Hard to say if immigrants were given less respect than women in this book though.Amounted to about half a dozen short biographies. Some more interesting than others. Some covered a bit of a discoverer's personal lives, others strictly their professional. Unfortunately, just a few days after finishing a chapter on what so-and-so did for the cause of microbe discovery, I was already forgetting details. They all tended to blend in together to me. At least I will still have some of the interesting stories in my head even if I can't remember who proved what."

[...] Here stood Louis Pasteur, while his 24 immune sheep scampered about among the carcasses of the same number of pitiful dead ones, [...] and all the world was there to see and to record and to be converted to his own faith in his passionate fight against needless death.""For a nonfiction history of science book that was published nearly ninety years ago (1926), this book is awesome! It brings to life the research and discoveries of at least at least a dozen microbe hunters, including Pasteur, Leeuwenhoeck, and Koch. I highly recommend it. I only gave it four stars instead of five because of the demeaning manner in which the author speaks of immigrants, Jews, and other minorities (admittedly typical of his time)."
175,0156027771,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7367522-gremrien,4,"I liked it.I never thought that such kind of books could be interesting for me now, after so many books about history of medicine and science, various biological discoveries, etc. I read them by dozens when I was in love with medicine and dreamt about “great discoveries,” too. So today I have a strong immunity to such books expressed mostly in complete absence of interest to them.However, this book surprised me how captivating those stories may be. First of all, I even learned a lot of new things, although, of course, the presented facts are mostly studied in medical schools/universities routinely. Поль де Крюи is very diligent and scrupulous to little sides of scientists’ life, and the whole story seems so vivid and exciting, even if it concerns very prosaic things. I believe, actually, that young people who discover “Охотники за микробами” in early age would never think about microbes, medicines, and scientific work as “prosaic.” Everything there is incredibly passionate."
176,0156027771,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26806510-tyler-hill,4,"This is a popular history, pure and simple, but it also a massively entertaining pop history. De Kruif may be the most excited student of any subject ever to put words to paper. He brings the pioneers of Microbiology and Virology to life with charm and genuine delight. Half the fun of the book is seeing how the author reacts to the exploits of the microbe hunters. Beyond Paul, though, the stories themselves capture the mind and dive it into the mysteries confronted by the likes of Pasteur, Koch, Spallanzani, and others. One should note that these stories are heavily editorialized (and some of the later chapters have none-too-subtle shades of racism and stereotyping), and that takes away from the member of the audience in search of concrete history. However, if one wants merely an introduction to the microbe hunters and an entertaining method for learning about them, this book is for that one. "

229,0156027771,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7440243-juliana,4,"Microbe Hunters was an interesting book. However I must say is only an introduction to the beginning of microbiology ideal for people that do not have any scientific background/education in the topic. My edition was from the 40’s so it was considerably older than the editions shown in Goodreads. The prose and the way it was written were beautiful; it was a pleasant surprise to find out (as a non-native English speaker) that English can be written in such a way. I do not know if the newer editions conserve this style and some people consider it out-dated but to me it made the book even more interesting. The only objection I have with this book in terms of vocabulary is the frequent use of racist words and expressions that are no longer accepted. I know that in the 20’s people were allowed to use them but I felt quite uncomfortable while reading those passages, it also decreased my admiration for the author, but that is just my personal opinion. I do wonder if the newer editions corrected those words. The first half of the book kept me reading without wanting to put the book down. Towards the middle and end of the book it got a bit boring but the very las chapter was for me one of the best. First and last stories were the best. I guess that is a good way to organize a book. I highly recommend this book for people interested in understanding how we got to discover that fascinating world of microorganisms. Also, as a scientist in training, it was especially motivating to see how much struggle science had in those days and it still does now. Seeing how perseverant those people were and that failure also led to success definitely helped me to see the “big picture” of what doing research means. "
230,0156027771,http://goodreads.com/user/show/273793-mark,4,"A story of the discovery and research of microbes as known in 1926. The book is great in showing how real science happens. It describes the mind numbing effort of countless experiments done on the way to support the few moments of insight (more often guesses) to figure out how things work. Every chapter focuses on a main scientist who is never some bland geek in a lab coat but who is always a living, breathing, quirky, often cantankerous individual. The scientific establishment is also clearly not a monolithic institution of perfection but a bunch of quarreling men each arguing for their own theories.The book is written in the breathless style you would expect more of something titled ""Great Science Adventures for Boys"". This is considerably different than the more mainstream tone of today's science popularizations. It makes for easy reading and is mildly entertaining.The book is written in 1926 and, as a friend put it, partakes of the ""background racism and sexism of the time"". Nothing shocking, just enough to make one glad to be living now instead of them. Also, you know the phrase ""No animal was harmed in the making of this movie."" Not the case here. If animal experimentation really bothers you, this is not the book for you."
231,0156027771,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1653748-dilly-dalley,4,"I am one of those readers who Bill Bryson appealed to in the 'Short History of Nearly Everything' when he wrote that he wanted to engender the 'wow' response when hearing aspects of scientific discovery. It can be a challenge to write with enough information to convey a complex idea, but not so much academic rigour that it repels the less expert reader. Paul De Kruif in the Microbe Hunters certainly manages to write an appealing scientific book. It has been in print since 1926, which is no mean feat. I enjoyed reading this and enjoyed that he wrote about the scientists, their temperaments and social histories as much as he wrote about the science. After a while though I began to miss the footnotes and references and I sometimes found myself thinking 'how would he know that?'. He makes some interesting statements about the scientists such as:Now, while Paul Ehrlich's head was an encylopedia of chemical knowledge, his hands were not the hands of an expert chemist. He hated complicated apparatus as much as he loved complicated theories. p336 How did Paul De Kruif know what Ehrlich hated? Not a big deal maybe because I did learn quite a bit about the history of microbiology and the early discoveries of these scientists and it read like a ripping yarn."
232,0156027771,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1081475-jessie,3,"As with many non-fiction books written many years ago, this book can be many things to today's readers. For once, it gives you an idea of the excitement that ran through the field of microbiology. From the first man to see bacteria through a microscope to scientists from the early 20th century who developed vaccines without even knowing what the disease *was*, Paul de Kruif chases the history of microbiology. It is exciting and inspiring, while also revealing the (potentially) true characters of the many microbe hunters who started the battle against disease that is still waged today.I think the downside of this book is the same thing that extends some of it's charm. The out of date writing. Yes, I know I can't blame an author for writing like it was 1929 when it was 1929, but it drove me a bit crazy how the author kept putting words in scientist's mouths. Literally. He would quote something that I really doubt (although I guess you never know) was actually recorded in a quotable way. And he kept referring to bacteria as ""little beaties"". It was endearing at first, but as the book goes on, it gets a bit old."
233,0156027771,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2131722-kevin,3,"A book for the geeky community that can handle a few old fashioned phrases and attitudes while reading about a history of some of the most important figures in the discovery of microbes. As for the style, there are some dated spellings and phrases (like rime and reason, or a clew instead of clue) and such. And the occasional little gem like, ""Was even one human life worth it, even the life of a Spanish immigrant?"" Hard to say if immigrants were given less respect than women in this book though.Amounted to about half a dozen short biographies. Some more interesting than others. Some covered a bit of a discoverer's personal lives, others strictly their professional. Unfortunately, just a few days after finishing a chapter on what so-and-so did for the cause of microbe discovery, I was already forgetting details. They all tended to blend in together to me. At least I will still have some of the interesting stories in my head even if I can't remember who proved what."

It can be a challenge to write with enough information to convey a complex idea, but not so much academic rigour that it repels the less expert reader. Paul De Kruif in the Microbe Hunters certainly manages to write an appealing scientific book. It has been in print since 1926, which is no mean feat. I enjoyed reading this and enjoyed that he wrote about the scientists, their temperaments and social histories as much as he wrote about the science. After a while though I began to miss the footnotes and references and I sometimes found myself thinking 'how would he know that?'. He makes some interesting statements about the scientists such as:Now, while Paul Ehrlich's head was an encylopedia of chemical knowledge, his hands were not the hands of an expert chemist.

From the first man to see bacteria through a microscope to scientists from the early 20th century who developed vaccines without even knowing what the disease *was*, Paul de Kruif chases the history of microbiology. It is exciting and inspiring, while also revealing the (potentially) true characters of the many microbe hunters who started the battle against disease that is still waged today.I think the downside of this book is the same thing that extends some of it's charm. The out of date writing. Yes, I know I can't blame an author for writing like it was 1929 when it was 1929, but it drove me a bit crazy how the author kept putting words in scientist's mouths. Literally. He would quote something that I really doubt (although I guess you never know) was actually recorded in a quotable way. And he kept referring to bacteria as ""little beaties"".

289,0156027771,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7440243-juliana,4,"Microbe Hunters was an interesting book. However I must say is only an introduction to the beginning of microbiology ideal for people that do not have any scientific background/education in the topic. My edition was from the 40’s so it was considerably older than the editions shown in Goodreads. The prose and the way it was written were beautiful; it was a pleasant surprise to find out (as a non-native English speaker) that English can be written in such a way. I do not know if the newer editions conserve this style and some people consider it out-dated but to me it made the book even more interesting. The only objection I have with this book in terms of vocabulary is the frequent use of racist words and expressions that are no longer accepted. I know that in the 20’s people were allowed to use them but I felt quite uncomfortable while reading those passages, it also decreased my admiration for the author, but that is just my personal opinion. I do wonder if the newer editions corrected those words. The first half of the book kept me reading without wanting to put the book down. Towards the middle and end of the book it got a bit boring but the very las chapter was for me one of the best. First and last stories were the best. I guess that is a good way to organize a book. I highly recommend this book for people interested in understanding how we got to discover that fascinating world of microorganisms. Also, as a scientist in training, it was especially motivating to see how much struggle science had in those days and it still does now. Seeing how perseverant those people were and that failure also led to success definitely helped me to see the “big picture” of what doing research means. "
290,0156027771,http://goodreads.com/user/show/273793-mark,4,"A story of the discovery and research of microbes as known in 1926. The book is great in showing how real science happens. It describes the mind numbing effort of countless experiments done on the way to support the few moments of insight (more often guesses) to figure out how things work. Every chapter focuses on a main scientist who is never some bland geek in a lab coat but who is always a living, breathing, quirky, often cantankerous individual. The scientific establishment is also clearly not a monolithic institution of perfection but a bunch of quarreling men each arguing for their own theories.The book is written in the breathless style you would expect more of something titled ""Great Science Adventures for Boys"". This is considerably different than the more mainstream tone of today's science popularizations. It makes for easy reading and is mildly entertaining.The book is written in 1926 and, as a friend put it, partakes of the ""background racism and sexism of the time"". Nothing shocking, just enough to make one glad to be living now instead of them. Also, you know the phrase ""No animal was harmed in the making of this movie."" Not the case here. If animal experimentation really bothers you, this is not the book for you."
