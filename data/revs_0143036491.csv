I am currently a little more than halfway through and feel the need to write something in case I don't finish it and lose the desire.Before critiquing Barry and his writing style, or lack thereof, his editor, Wendy Wolf deserves special mention. This is the first book I have ever read in which I have made special note of the editor and will refuse to read anything she works on in the future. I was sorely tempted to tally the number of repetitions of key phrases, pieces of information and entire narrative sequences. Perhaps editing this book was too daunting a task to do it well and still preserve the intent and message, but if so, I would have quit. Wendy gets 1 star.Before she edited it though, he wrote it. As I understand it, the 1918 Influenza outbreak, with its undercurrents of concurrent revolutions in medical science, oppressive (and at times seemingly unconstitutional) governmental policy, sheer human agony, and internationality, is replete with its own inherent drama. No additional tear-jerkers are necessary - the reporting of how 50 million people died worldwide would be plenty. Barry decides that manufactured melodrama is the most effective vehicle to convey this, however. How can one assume how people felt during a worldwide pandemic? After assuming it, how can one essentially write fiction in a non-fiction book as it is described?In addition to his atrocious writing style, Barry seems to thread 3 or 4 books into one, and doesn't even separate them with definitive breaks in his book. In a text which is nominally about an historical event, we read biographical sketches of several men who weren't even involved in fighting the disease.I recommend this to no one. Read the wikipedia article on '1918 Influenza'. It's probably far less annoying.UPDATE: After getting through 300 out of 460 pages of this poorly organized, melodramatic, poor excuse for historiography, I realized I was not only wasting my time reading it, but I was also wasting my time complaining about it to my friends and family. Thats a TRIPLE waste of time. Barry is not worth this investment. I caution every one of you. Unless you want to boost your self esteem and have a John Irving moment of ""Wow, I could seriously do way better than this... and this guy got published!"" DO NOT READ THIS BOOK. I hope you read this, Barry, and send me an apology.I've never written a review this bitter. Mostly because I've never been this bitter about a book."
1,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/78485297-mario-the-lone-bookwolf,4,"Pandemics recur, just as history repeats itself, and it´s all simply a question of how much can be learned from it and how far technology has marched on.  They were at war, so they couldn´t tell that there were outbreaks, only the neutral Spain could say it without the danger of demotivating the population. Today there are mostly just trade wars anymore, but the rules have stayed the same and looking at the potential immense economical damage, the intuition of those trying to hide outbreaks was right.  The influence of such pandemics on human, primate, mammal, and rodent evolution must have been immense, as wiping out huge parts of the population or even the whole population until extinction, and might have happened many times. Without samples and more advanced technology to detect virus DNA and RNA in archeology, or to find the right fossils, it will long stay unclear how massive the impact on the development of higher life forms on the planet might have been. The differences between 1920 and 2020 are so immense that it takes time to realize how real and ever more realistic this danger is, because we tend to believe that it can´t get so bad:Medicine was very primitive, but we didn´t really come so much closer to a solution in preventing outbreaks and finding cures.They didn´t have cars, planes, anything to spread it worldwide or just in a nation with such a speed as today. No freeways, just trains and some roads with horses on them. As long as the horses didn't get it, the spread was very slow.Fewer people having not so much contact with another.Just telephones to communicate, nothing to coordinate the efforts of a state or even a whole continent. A large question is what population group is most affected and if, when the virus has found its prime target, it won´t mutate again and switch the victim again. The book is not just about the Spanish flu, but also about the doctors and researches that tried to deal with it with methods that seem medieval compared to nowadays standards and by mixing the historical facts with these protagonists, it becomes very vivid for a nonfiction title. It has a bit much redundancy and it would be a five star if the author had put more focus on not repeating himself and telling very similar stories, wildly jumping between geography, personal stories, and the medicine of those days, making it all a bit blurry and unnecessary complicated to follow. Even if nowadays governments wouldn´t be incompetent, the human factor alone is highly disturbing. Just some people who are immune to rudimentary hygiene rules and logical arguments are enough, and guess what one little piglet that refuses to wash hands, sneeze in the crook of the arm, etc. could do for spreading diseases. Not to speak of antisocial psychos who do it on purpose, try to get it, and spread it.  We didn´t write our own history, nature in the form of plagues did a lot of it and it would be arrogant and dangerous to believe that we are now so highly advanced and have so much fancy technology (and it´s a techno optimist who is saying that) that we are invulnerable, as if we already had nanobots patrolling each body and sending signals to produce individualized vaccines as soon as any invader is detected.But we aren´t there and the incompetence, arrogance, and idiocy of the Western governments will cost many lives now and in the future, until technology will eradicate the last plagues, what is just a question of time, not of if. There might even be already the potential for producing and developing new vaccines, testing methods, and preventive measures. But the pharma companies make no money with developing cures for plagues that might never occur and the state has no interest in investing in protecting its citizens, although this could even be seen as military research where a bit of money is invested in general. Why it´s even not possible to produce enough test kits or establish a global network of testing stations that monitor the world or to have intelligent plans for pandemics or to listen to experts or to not worsen the situation with polemics and fake news or to quarantine early enough or…but, as said, the politicians are like: „Lalalala…..ignoring experts…..yada yada yada…. Stupid decision stupid decision stupid decision“, while unnecessary piles of corpses are exponentially growing.Some links dealing with the current pandemic: CNN live updateshttps://edition.cnn.com/asia/live-new...John Hopkins CSSE world maphttps://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/ap...Youtube statisticshttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgylp...A wiki walk can be as refreshing to the mind as a walk through nature in this completely overrated real life outside books: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish...https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandemic"
2,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1232712-matt,4,"“Epidemiological evidence suggest that a new influenza virus originated in Haskell County, Kansas, early in 1918. Evidence further suggests that this virus traveled east across the state to a huge army base, and from there to Europe. Later it began its sweep through North America, through Europe, through South America, through Asia and Africa, through isolated islands in the Pacific, through all the wide world. In its wake followed a keening sound that rose from the throats of mourners like the wind…”-	John M. Barry, The Great InfluenzaThis book is what happens when I combine a smart phone, Amazon’s one-click shopping, and my low-key binge drinking. I had just sat down in my favorite chair for my weekly wine-drunk. No sooner had I dropped some ice cubes into a pint-glass full of club soda and cheap chardonnay, than Steven Soderbergh’s Contagion began playing on HBO. I never intended to watch the movie. Based on the trailers, I had decided that it was too much like the movie Outbreak, except with fewer monkeys and 100% less helicopter chases involving Dustin Hoffman and Cuba Gooding, Jr. Still, people who drink Yellow Tail out of pint glasses can’t be choosers, so I let the film unspool. Like all of Soderbergh’s works, Contagion was slick, engaging, and sharply edited. As the all-star cast began dying from a mysterious and highly contagious disease, and as I started to get a buzz from that pint of cheap wine, it occurred to me that I was suddenly, desperately interested in infectious diseases. So I bought John M. Barry’s The Great Influenza, about the so-called Spanish flu of 1918 that killed as many as 100 million people. Unlike influenza, my interest in the topic quickly wore off. It was only several months later that I finally got around to reading it. Totally worth the drunken purchase!Barry’s epic is a work of incredible scope and depth. It combines accessible science/medical writing, perceptive character sketches, and telling human anecdotes to corral a story – a global pandemic – that doesn’t necessarily lend itself to the written word. (Film is the more obvious medium for pandemic stories. All you need is a computerized map of the world in a neutral color. Then, have that map start to turn red while someone intones, “24 hours…48 hours…72 hours…”). In Barry’s words, the 1918 influenza pandemic “was the first great collision between nature and modern science.” To that end, he begins the book with a brisk, wide-ranging, and fascinating history of medicine, gradually narrowing his focus to the state of American medicine at the turn of the century. It was, in a word, deplorable. There was no consistency in education, no overarching standards, no pursuit of progress. While American doctors were still pondering the leech, Europeans were making the advances: In Europe, governments, universities, and wealthy donors helped support medical research. In the United States, no government, institution, or philanthropist even began to approach a similar level of support. As the Hopkins medical school was opening, American theological schools enjoyed endowments of $18 million, while medical school endowments totaled $500,000…The future of American medicine got a bit brighter with William Welch and the founding of the Johns Hopkins Medical School. Welch is one of the titanic figures in American science, a stethoscope-wearing J. Robert Oppenheimer – not necessarily a great scientist or discoverer, but a manager nonpareil. It was Welch who would lead the U.S. response to the influenza outbreak. The Great Influenza attempts to tell a huge story. An outbreak is hard to contain in a book (and also, obviously, in real life). It is not a singular event, but a worldwide phenomenon; it does not happen in a single place, to a single person, but to everyplace, and millions of persons. Accordingly, the narrative diffuses once Barry begins the story of the flu itself (ground zero of the pandemic is hotly debated; Barry pinpoints Haskell County, Kansas, as the originating spot). Of necessity, the story begins to hop around a lot, to locations all over the globe. There are a lot of staggering numbers (x numbers infected, y numbers dead) interspersed with illustrative stories that provide a micro view of a global disaster. For instance, Barry relates the story of an Army camp commander (World War I was the mechanism by which this disease spread so far and wide) who committed suicide after failing to take proper steps to protect and quarantine his troops. One of Barry’s real gifts is to explain medicine and biology to a part-time drunk, full-time nonscientist such as myself. I am a concrete thinker, a literalist. My ability to imagine things I can’t see – such as biological processes – is surpassed only by my ability to do one-armed pushups while shaving. Using metaphor and analogy, Barry does a wonderful job of providing both the hard science and a simple explanation to interpret it. For instance, Barry explains how the immune response to influenza ultimately made healthy young adults the flu’s greatest victim: Macrophages and “natural killer” cells – two kinds of white blood cells that seek and destroy all foreign invaders… – patrol the entirety of the respiratory tract and lungs. Cells in the respiratory tracts secrete enzymes that attack bacteria and some viruses (including influenza) or block them from attaching to tissue beneath the mucus, and these secretions also bring more white cells and antibacterial enzymes into a counterattack; if a virus is the invader, white blood cells also secrete interferon, which can block viral infection. All these defenses work so well that the lungs themselves, although directly exposed to the outside air, are normally sterile.But when the lungs do become infected, other defenses, lethal and violent defenses, come into play. For the immune system is at its core a killing machine. It targets infecting organisms, attacks with a complex arsenal of weapons – some of them savage weapons – and neutralizes or kills the invader. The balance, however, between kill and overkill, response and overresponse, is a delicate one. The immune system can behave like a SWAT team that kills the hostage along with the hostage taker, or the army that destroys a village to save it.The 1918 influenza pandemic killed between 21 million (according to a 1927 AMA study) and 100 million people (according to Nobel laureate and influenza researcher Macfarlane Burnet). That meant that about 5% of the population of the world died. It is a terrifying proposition. Using today’s population numbers, the fatalities would be between 70 and 300 million people. With all the different flu scares we’ve had, Barry was eventually obligated (perhaps by his publishers, at gunpoint) to update his book to remind us how we’re all going to die. Like all “new afterwords,” the one included at the end of The Great Influenza feels halfhearted and unnecessary. If you’ve paid attention at all to the hundreds of preceding pages, it is not difficult to extrapolate what might happen during a present-day outbreak of an infectious disease or out-of-control virus. The thing about The Great Influenza is that it is almost always relevant. Always, there is a disease, somewhere in the world, read to spring forth. In the years since this was first published in 2004, we’ve had Ebola, SARS, and Zika to terrify us. It’s hard to know what will crop up next, and whether this will be the one to turn the map all red. Ultimately, I don’t think I was half as terrified as I was supposed to be, mainly because I have a lot of other existential threats to worry about: cancer; heart disease; wine poisoning. Thus, I rate my chance of dying in a deadly pandemic as relatively low. I also feel that the world is more attune to these things than ever before. We no longer believe in miasma theory or the humors of our bodies. Conversely, we believe in quarantining, washing hands, and reverse-engineering both pathogens and the journeys they travel. Still, we are living – you might have noticed – in an extremely knitted-together world. All it takes is a handful of people leaving an uncontrolled hot zone, hopping on an airplane, and starting an exponential event that only Hollywood could love, and no one can halt.(Update, March 31, 2020: As I write this, I am in the third week of self-quarantine, following a shelter-in-place order necessitated by the spread of Covid-19. The coronavirus has definitely made the penultimate paragraph of my original review look like the work of a prize fool. Turns out, I should have been more worried about dying in a pandemic. Certainly, being stuck at home has drastically increased my risk of wine poisoning. Of course, when I wrote about the advanced state of science - back in 2013 - I had no idea how many people on this earth didn't believe in science. More to the point, I did not know that there were so many people so militantly anti-science that they would go to a hospital in the midst of a pandemic to take videos, all in an attempt to disprove a deadly, worldwide virus as some massive hoax. On second thought, maybe I was right. Maybe the virus isn't the real danger. Maybe the thing we should all fear is ourselves)."
3,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/111566858-greta,5,"“Influenza killed more people in twenty-four weeks than AIDS has killed in twenty-four years.” Lasting from February 1918 to April 1920, the Spanish-flu infected 500 million people–about a third of the world's population at the time. The death toll is estimated between 17 million and 50 million, some even claim 100 Million, making it one of the deadliest pandemics in human history. The SpreadingSan Francisco military parade 1918It began when sick farm animals infected soldiers in Kansas during the First World War. The overcrowded conditions in the army camps exacerbated the spread of the disease among the soldiers. When the virus spread with the troops to Europe and across the world, the disease proofed its unequaled severity and speed. Soldiers couldn‘t escape from infecting each other on the crowded ships and dead bodies were just thrown into the sea. The military parade‘s, which weren't cancelled due to its war propaganda, then caused the massive outbreak among US citizens. President Woodrow Wilson failed to promote public awareness of the disease, but used press censorship and the deliberate lack of information to deceive the American people instead. Ultimately, the withholding of information from the public, to keep their focus on the war effort, caused the spread of the disease. No one knew what precautions to take, and no one even knew what the exact problem was, until it was too late. San Francisco significantly emerged from a lockdown too soon during the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic, leading to an even deadlier 2nd wave.The Infection Most people suffocated from the fluid in their lungsThe incubation period was approximately 24-48h and victims often died within 12 hours. Some simply dropped dead on the spot, or days after developing symptoms. But more common were bleeding, vomiting, delirium, and blue-tinged extremities – something unlike any flu before. Their skin turned blue and their lungs filled with blood and fluid that caused them to suffocate. This was accompanied by fever, massive pain and blood splashing out of all body openings, such as noses, ears and eyes. The lungs were torn apart like they were hit by weapons or toxic gas. In just one year the average life expectancy in America plummeted by a dozen years, with an averagely of three death‘s per family. Dead bodies were piling up everywhere and people were living with their dead family members in their homes, without any capacities to remove them.Hundred-thousands of children became orphansYoung adults were effected the most and almost 75% of the victims were between the age of 18 and 40. The virus itself mostly wasn‘t deadly but the correspondend immune response, attacking the lungs most of all. Because healthy young adults have the strongest immune systems, they had the most severe reactions, which made them so likely to die. Hundred-thousands of children lost their mothers to Influenza and their fathers simultaneously in the war, ending up as orphans. Citizens started to turn against each other and refused to leave their homes to help each other. Social services desperately tried to find women to take in all the orphans, but no one volunteered. When people saw each other getting sick, in desperate need for help, they turned their back. Instead of being told to practice social distancing, the opposite was the case, but they closed their businesses and isolated themselves anyways. Medical standards in 1918The capacities of the medical system couldn‘t catch up and dead people couldn‘t effectively be gathered anymore.The story of the pandemic is interleaved with the story of American medicine, to explain the state of medicine at the time of the crisis and the development in the century before. The medical limitations of that time hindered the ability of doctors to understand and control the transmission of the disease. It‘s shocking how easy it was to become a physician in early 20th-century America, and how often doctors didn‘t have proper degrees. However it was also the time that an advocation for stricter admissions processes began and the John Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health was established. Yet no one knew what to do to protect themselves and it was not until after the pandemic established it‘s force, that medical efforts were beginning to catch up, and advice for the public to keep healthy were announced. There were no effective drugs or vaccines available and for the largest amount of time, no one even identified it as Influenza. Meanwhile the number of available Doctors and nurses was extremely scarce to begin with, as over 800 of them were on the front. But a large amount of those who remained in the US died in the hospitals, were bribed by patients to treat them above others, abducted and hold hostage in family homes, or simply stopped showing up for work, to not be infected. One quarter of the patients in the hospitals died each day, which didn‘t have enough space for all the patients to begin with.Politics and MediaMeasurement weren‘t taken, until it was already too late The politics and media played an important role, as they denied that anything was happening. They tried to cover everything up, to calm the masses and stay focused on the war. Doctors constantly warned and bagged politicians to intervene but it took month until at least schools were closed and citizens ordered to wear masks. If state governor‘s did anything at all, they imposed orders to open businesses on staggered shifts to avoid overcrowding on the subways. Consequently the severity of the situation was denied, even though dead people were piling up everywhere. Politicians followed the strategy to tell people, that it was nothing but the flu and that the biggest enemy was fear. They claimed that those who got scared were more likely to be infected. The media refused to publish numbers of dead people and tried to promote calmness. However the more the media lied, the more scared the people became. They realized, that their situation was completely ignored and that they wouldn‘t receive support. When false rumors spread that dogs could be transmitting the disease, cities killed their entire dog population. People were starting to talk about the Black Death and it wasn‘t until years later, that it was discovered that it was an Influenza mutation. The pandemic didn‘t end until there was no one left to be infected and die. 1918 mask adaptions - also ordered way too late “As terrifying the disease was, the press made it more so. They terrified by making little of it, for what officials and the press said bore no relationship to what people saw and touched and smelled and endured. People could not trust what they read. Uncertainty follows distrust, fear follow uncertainty, and, under conditions such as these, terror follows fear.” This book is a fascinating look at how the virus spread and how physicians and researchers rallied to mobilize against a global health crisis. The story of the Spanish Flu of 1918 proofs, that a society's ability to survive a pandemic, is as much a political question as it is a medical one. The more devastating it is to see, that Trump blindly repeats previous mistakes and obviously didn‘t learn from the past. It also put‘s todays media reporting into perspective and a positive light. Though I claim that they partially caused counterproductive panic, they have a historical responsibility to question everything and by no means be too positive. This book didn‘t just teach me about the Spanish Flu, but also completely changed my look on politics and media in the context of Covid-19."
4,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5903843-matt,5,"As the world is wrapped up in the COVID-19 pandemic, I thought that I would try to educate myself a little more on the general topic while forced to isolate with books. I have often wanted to know a little more about the Spanish Influenza of 1918-19, which was said to be one of the worst pandemics in modern times. As we are in something similar at present, I turned to John M. Barry’s book to permit me to speak with ease as it relates to the spread of infection and the reactions by the public and politicians alike. Barry opens with a jaw-dropping tale of the emergence of medical schools and their lax entrance requirements, making the moniker ‘doctor’ seem less impressive. It was only students studying in Baltimore at Johns Hopkins who were put through the motions of a significant medical education and who earned the title with some confidence. From there, the narrative moves to offer some backstory on the emergence of the influenza, citing that its ‘Spanish’ name came not from the origins, but that Spanish newspapers offered frank discussion of events taking place, not censored during the Great War. Talk of an influenza with many deaths filled the headlines, which hit the newswires and the name stuck. Barry explores the origins, based on his own research, as well as how infection ran rampant throughout Europe and soldiers from all countries involved brought it back to their homelands during troop replenishments or retreats. With the only way to travel back to America being the ship, close-quartered troops passed the infection between one another with ease, beginning an explosion of cases once troops made their way across the country. Barry examines how health officials sought to contain things and pushed for hygiene campaigns, which were only somewhat effective. Public Health officials pushed isolation, cleanliness, and the need to take precautions, as the spread ran through the country and left medical officials scrambling to contain the spread. How things seem to parallel what is taking place now, to a differing degree.Barry offers the scientific analysis of the topic as well, discussing frankly about how viruses develop and leap from animals to humans, including how immunity develops. The novice reader can learn much about this and how medicines can help occasionally, as well as what makes the virus able to overpower the human body. There is also a great discussion about how the virus attaches itself to the body through the lungs and other air passages. This discussion not only educates the reader into how infection takes place—perhaps justifying the precautions like washing, masks, and gloves—and the speed at which things can progress. Barry pulls no punches, using early 20th century medical technology to explain how things spread with ease and what could be done to eradicate any further spread. Fitting this medical and scientific knowledge with the narrative about the historical happenings, the reader has a better understanding of the situation. While this may not arm the reader to understand the intricacies of World Health Organisation documents or the high-level analysis done by leading politicians in their briefings, Barry gives the reader a better understanding of how things were during this world scare and what parallels can be drawn to the current COVID-19 pandemic.Peppered amongst these two major narratives is the handful of scientists who studied the influenza and sought to find cures. The interested reader will discover a great deal about immunology and how scientists must use vigorous techniques, as well as exhausting their tests on animals and humans alike, in order to eradicate what was fast becoming a horrible disease that was growing exponentially. Barry follows the work of these essential scientists throughout, from their early focus on how the influenza infected humans through the various tests and microscopic analyses. Thereafter, it was infecting and watching the results in animals that permitted scientists to come up with something that could be used to stop the spread of the influenza. This is a solid teachable moment for the reader about immunisation and its importance to keep disease away from the population. Whatever the reader feels about needles and how their children react, Barry makes a blunt plea to eradicate new strains of long dormant diseases with some simple precautionary measures. Whether these cause autism is something to COVID-19 conspiracists can bring up when fashioning tin-foil hats at their upcoming social distancing picnics.Whether the reader is a strong believer in the health crisis COVID-19 is unleashing on the world or feels that this is a political conspiracy drummed up to hide bigger issues (I have heard people on both sides share their sentiments with me), John M. Barry’s book is highly educational and fits perfectly into how things are playing out at present. Barry offers a great deal of background on so many interesting topics, all of which are interconnected to the issues at hand. The exploration of viruses and how their emergence in other mammals can ‘leap’ to humans with relative ease explains some of the new and odd influenzas and infections that are seen across the world today. Barry does not dilute the discussion, but his explanations are digestible by most readers with a general understanding of basic medical and scientific terminology. Paired with the thorough discussion of the historical goings-on in Europe and, eventually, America, the story is more complete and the policies enacted make a great deal of sense. The reader attuned with news reports may find parallels with what was done in 1918-19 to the present reaction in the United States, though it is sure that Woodrow Wilson allowed local governments and health officials to complete their work unimpeded with false hopes and unreasonable timelines. In a number of well-documented chapters, Barry illustrates just how vast the influenza infection and battle became in America, as well as how deeply felt the deaths were to many who had no idea what was going on. The empathetic reader will likely feel some heart pain for the orphans, the families who lost loved ones overnight, and the emotional battle of giving up the bodies of those they loved, sure that mass graves would leave them unidentifiable in the future. Barry’s book is surely a great one for those who are cooped up and want to get some context, as well as the curious reader, such as myself, who wonder how reactions to past calamities compare to today’s overly dramatic delivery in the 24-hour news cycle. Kudos, Mr Barry, for this enlightening look at an event in world history that surely has some connections to the events in today’s COVID-19 world!This book fulfils Topic #7: Catastrophe, of the Equinox #10 Reading Challenge.Love/hate the review?

5,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/271206-dave,3,"This book had promise, and is good in spots - but the overall product suffers greatly from lack of direction and editorial control. If I could rate the best third of the book, I would give it five stars. The other two thirds of the book suffers substantially from a lack of focus, inclusion of unnecessary information, and overly dramatic narrative. And, to add insult to injury, the footnotes are handled in such a fashion that they become nearly useless.In the afterword, it becomes quite obvious that the author made a bad assumption at the start of his endeavor. After spending seven years researching the book, he concluded that he could not tell the story of the epidemic without covering the history medical science leading up until that time. He also wanted to write the book from the perspective of the scientists and politicians who reacted to the influenza outbreak; he seemed more interested in covering their actions than the virus itself.These assumptions are incorrect. The most interesting and relevant portion of the book is the history of the virus itself. If Barry had simply explained how the virus worked, how it may have come into being, and then followed each wave of the epidemic in chronological order, this book would have been much more enjoyable and much shorter. Instead, he covers material which is not relevant - and by focusing on this material he breaks up his coverage of the virus, thereby rendering the best part of the book less enjoyable.The first third of the book is dedicated to the history of modern medical science. Some of the material is of interest, but this history is not necessary for any discussion of the influenza virus. It has absolutely no impact on the remainder of the book. The reader could simply skip the first 30% of the book and would not notice it. I actually found this information to be interesting, that that does not warrant their inclusion in a 450 page book with a supposed focus on the 1918 epidemic.The second portion of the book is the most direct discussion of the virus in the book, and it is quite good. Barry provides a brief explanation of how the virus works and why it is so successful. He then discusses the impact of the disease, rivaling any horror story while doing so. The amount of chaos and suffering caused by the outbreak is quite sobering.During this time, Barry also discusses the prevailing political climate. As this outbreak occurred during WWI. President Wilson's desire to turn the entire country into a weapon required news of the virus to be controlled rather tightly. This was exacerbated by a good deal of corruption at lower levels of government. The result was a climate in which misinformation and inaction killed tens of thousands of Americans. This material is entirely relevant, and I actually might have liked for him to focus more on it.The last portion of the book covers the scientific community's attempts to control the virus. This is really a misguided effort, as there is no significant discovery to work towards. While the scientists Barry introduces the reader to are all very accomplished, none of them are able to make any headway with their influenza work. The book becomes a spastic collection of various experiments carried out by a handful of scientists. The text is hard to follow as it is all over the map, and after you finish it you realized that the last third of the book is about as relevant as the first third, only less interesting. It is almost comical; one of the scientists he covers during the entire book is Paul Lewis. Towards the end of the book, after discussing Paul Lewis' troubled family life ad nauseam, and filling the reader in on all sorts of work Lewis did with tuberculosis (which had no impact on any influenza research), Barry goes on to tell us how Lewis died while working with the yellow fever in Brazil. So essentially, any mention of Paul Lewis in the book was completely superfluous."
6,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16958299-dr-appu-sasidharan,5,"History is not only learning about the past but also learning from the past to shape our present and the future. This book in such a way is not only a compendium about the Spanish flu (1918 - 1920) but also a vivid description about the pattern of the current pandemic Covid-19 (Barry wrote this book in 2004) and also the pandemics that might happen in the future. Spanish flu is something every Medico might have studied during their Med school days. Still, this book gave me so much new information which I haven’t found anywhere else. As Bill Gates said, “Barry will teach you almost everything you need to know about one of the deadliest outbreaks in human history through this book”. Just like the striking resemblances during the repeated outbreaks of Ebola in Africa, there is a striking resemblance between the Spanish flu and the current COVID- 19 outbreak (even though the former occurred a century ago) One big tragedy might help us to save ourselves from a more significant catastrophe in the future. We can see multiple examples of these in both the pandemics. I will cite a couple over here.San Francisco After suffering from one of the worst earthquakes in the history of the United States in 1906, San Francisco was recouping when the pandemic hit the USA in 1918. According to Barry of all the major cities in America, San Francisco confronted the fall wave most honestly and efficiently. That may have had something to do with surviving and rebuilding after the major earthquake.  Well begun is half done. Even though it is true, it doesn’t give us the liberty to be complacent or overconfident after a good beginning. It seems that it is what happened in San Francisco later during the third wave. Dr William Hassler, Chief of San Francisco’s Board of Health, was an early advocate of taking strong preventative measures against the flu. He, however, seemed to curb his concern and went so far as to predict that influenza would not even reach San Francisco. San Franciscans had to pay very severely for it, and the third wave hit San Francisco severely. Kerala The second example I can cite is from my personal experience from our ‘God’s own country’. Kerala had a significant outbreak of Nipah virus infection a couple of years ago. The disease was so severe that the Government and health sector had to take extraordinary measures to prevent the spread of the infection. Then the COVID -19 happened. The first COVID- 19 case in India was reported in my native place in Kerala way before it was declared a pandemic. But the health sector here took it very seriously and took all the measures to prevent the spread, and we were able to control the infection to a very significant extent. Even though the health sector in our State is one of the best in India, nobody will argue with me when I say that the previous Nipah outbreak and the experience gained from it was a significant factor which enabled us to tackle the COVID -19 pandemic to a great extent until now.  These two examples shows the importance of knowing our past well. Books like these are there to serve this exact purpose.Racism and influenza This book also says about the vital relationship between racism and influenza. According to Barry, “The 1918 pandemic did not, in general, follow any pattern of race and class antagonism. In epidemiological terms, there was a correlation between population density and hence class and deaths. But the disease struck down everywhere and everyone almost similarly.” Leaders in time of Crisis and Lost trust This is a crucial topic we all are facing especially during this pandemic. Barry says “Whoever held power whether it is city Government or some private gathering of the locals generally failed to keep the community together. They failed because they lost trust. They lost trust because they lied. It is impossible to quantify how many deaths the lies caused. San Francisco was a rare exception. Its leader told the truth and the city respnded heroically during the fall wave. Those in authority everywhere else were reassuring the people that it is the just influenza, only influenza. Some people have had believed them. Some people must have exposed to the virus in ways they would not have otherwise. Atleast some of these people must have died who would have otherwise lived.”Leadership is as important as the infrastructure when we are dealing with a crisis like a pandemic. We can see the countries which had great infrastructure yet suffered severly in both the 1918 and 2020 pandemics due to poor leadership. Around 5% of world population were wiped out from this world within 2 years with most of the deaths occuring in a span of 12 weeks. This shows how severe was the 1918 pandemic. Among the developed countries Italy and America suffered the worst while India suffered the worst among the developing countries in both the pandemics. Barry in 2004 while finishing this book was saying,” It’s time to start spending serious money on influenza.” We didn’t do it. We had to suffer for it in 2020. We can hope that at least by now we have learned a lesson and we will spend the adequate amount of money to ensure that such severe outbreaks won’t happen in the future. People are of different opinions whether we could have prevented the current pandemic or not. But there is no doubt amongst anyone that all of us could have responded to it in a better way."
7,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/279256-diane,4,"This was a fascinating read about the 1918 flu pandemic, and a good overview of the history of medicine in America. I don't remember learning much about this topic in school — teachers seemed to treat it like more of a footnote to World War I, which was itself treated as a footnote to all the coverage of World War II. But a friend had recommended this book to me more than a decade ago (he was always recommending big works of nonfiction), and it took the coronavirus outbreak for me to finally get it from the library and dedicate myself to reading it. Here is a good introductory section from the Prologue:In 1918 an influenza virus emerged — probably in the United States — that would spread around the world, and one of its earliest appearances in lethal form came in Philadelphia. Before that worldwide pandemic faded away in 1920, it would kill more people than any other outbreak of disease in human history. Plague in the 1300s killed a far larger proportion of the population — more than one-quarter of Europe — but in raw numbers influenza killed more than plague then, more than AIDS today ...And they died with extraordinary ferocity and speed. Although the influenza pandemic stretched over two years, perhaps two-thirds of the deaths occurred in a period of twenty-four weeks, and more than half of those deaths occurred in even less time, from mid-September to early December 2018. Influenza killed more people in a year than the Black Death of the Middle Ages killed in a century; it killed more people in twenty-four weeks than AIDS has killed in twenty-four years.Barry has a gift for writing narrative nonfiction; I was engrossed in this book, even though parts of it were a bit technical and required extra focus to follow along. I listened to this on audio, narrated by Scott Brick, who gave an excellent performance. I appreciated this book so much I looked up Barry's other works and intend to read them as well.While a lot has changed in 100 years, a lot has also stayed the same, including how selfish and stubborn people can be, how elected officials often fail to lead during a crisis, and that some people get angry when scientists and experts tell them things they don't want to hear. Here is a good quote from the Afterword that has stayed with me:In 1918 the lies of officials and of the press never allowed the terror to condense into the concrete. The public could trust nothing and so they knew nothing. So a terror seeped into the society that prevented one woman from caring for her sister, that prevented volunteers from bringing food to families too ill to feed themselves and who starved to death because of it, that prevented trained nurses from responding to the most urgent calls for their services. The fear, not the disease, threatened to break the society apart. As Victor Vaughan — a careful man, a measured man, a man who did not overstate to make a point — warned, ""Civilization could have disappeared within a few more weeks.""So the final lesson, a simple one yet one most difficult to execute, is that those who occupy positions of authority must lessen the panic that can alienate all within a society. Society cannot function if it is every man for himself. By definition, civilization cannot survive that.Those in authority must retain the public's trust. The way to do that is to distort nothing, to put the best face on nothing, to try to manipulate no one. Lincoln said that first, and best.Leadership must make whatever horror exists concrete. Only then will people be able to break it apart."
8,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70492479-mara,5,"4.5 stars -- Interestingly enough, the strongest part of this book in my opinion is the table setting that Barry does to describe the progress of American medical science and practice in the lead up to WWI. Learning about the transition from the heroic age of medicine to the early modern age of what we would recognize as a professionalized force of doctors and nurses was totally fascinating and gives a helpful window into how and why American attitudes towards doctors developed. That said, of course the description of the pandemic itself and the way it unfolded amidst the chaos of WWI was fascinating and incredibly relevant. The afterword is particularly harrowing to read in light of the events of 2020. All around, super strong historical non-fiction that is sadly applicable to our current world"
9,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1542839-mike,4,"This book took me a long time to read, for several reasons. First, it really is two books in one. The first book is a history of the men and women and institutions involved in the change to scientific medicine in this country around the turn of the century. The second is the story of the influenza plague of 1918-1922 itself, the horrors of it, the death rate, the physical symptoms, the psychological effects, and the rather interesting fact that it seems to have been largely forgotten as the history of the 20th century wore on. Barry bookends the second book with the first book, and you get the impression of an author who has researched the bejeesus out of his subject and time period, and is just brimming over with information that he needs to get down on paper. But the book on scientific medicine really needs to be edited out of the book about the flu plague, because the interaction of the two stories is bizarrely very small - when the plague comes, the scientists and researchers he has spent so much time describing have very little, almost no, impact on the progression of the disease itself. When the flu passes, the researchers continue to work on it, frantically, but nearly everyone is wrong about the cause of the disease for years and year. Other scientific discoveries are made in studies of other diseases, and finally a study of infected pigs sheds light onto the causative agent. The organization of the telling of the influenza epidemic also needs editing, as Barry tells the story roughly chronologically but then diverts around geographically, sometimes telling the same kinds of stories again and again. So by the end of the book, you've read several horrifying stories of deaths by neglect, several accounts of the desperate medicinal efforts made, several accounts of rapid movement of the virus through populations. All of this loose organization makes the book a bit of a slog. The second reason the book took me so long to read is just how painful the descriptions of the virus, the horrible effects it had on the bodies of its victims, the families of its victims, the communities of its victims, the mindsets of its victims and those who lived with the epidemic, were . . . it was horrifying in its scope and scale. The author certainly succeeds in one of his objectives, and that is to let everyone know that FLU CAN KILL, and even though everyone treats it with nonchalance, it is only through luck that we haven't encountered a very virulent and lethal strain lately. Reading this book would be an important thing to do for people who routinely skip their flu shot every year, and will spur the reader to think about what they would do with sick family members if the healthcare system was completely overwhelmed. The most interesting part of the book was a chapter on the psychological damage the virus wrought on some people, and trying to link Woodrow Wilson's actions during the Paris peace conference of 1919 with changes brought on by a bought of the flu in April of that year. I think he proves his case that Wilson was changed mentally by the illness. What is less clear is whether the outcome of the Peace Conference would have been different because of it - the Germans were delusional about the end of WWI in any case, so it is a bit hard to lay Hitler and WWII at the feet of the flu. I still would recommend this to nearly everyone. It is important to realize what we might have to deal with during any given flu season, and this book should be enough to scare anyone straight with regard to that. The author does a great job of describing the science of the pathology and doesn't make any big mistakes with the molecular biology that I caught. "

People write about war. They write about the Holocaust. They write about the horrors that people inflict on people. Apparently they forget the horrors that nature inflicts on people, the horrors that make humans least significant.
Like so many people nowadays, I have been scrambling to wrap my mind around the current pandemic. This led me, naturally, to the last major worldwide outbreak: the 1918 influenza. I have a distant connection to this disease. My great-grandfather (after whom I was named) was drafted out of Cornell’s veterinary school to work as a nurse in a temporary hospital set up for flu victims. I read the letters he sent to his mother, describing the experience.John Barry’s account of this virulent flu is sobering to say the least. In a matter of months, the flu spread across the world and caused between 50 and 100 million deaths. More American soldiers died from this flu than from the entire Vietnam War. In most places the mortality rate hovered around two percent, but it struck much more fiercely elsewhere. In the Fiji Islands, 14 percent of its population succumbed; in Western Samoa, twenty-two percent; and in Labrador, a third of the population died. And because the disease mainly struck young people—people in their twenties and thirties—thousands were left orphans.Barry’s book is not, however, simply a record of deaths. He sets the historical scene by giving a brief overview of contemporary medicine. In the early 1900s, modern medicine was just coming into its own. After centuries in which it was thought that bad air (“miasma”) caused illness, and in which bleeding was the most popular “cure,” researchers were beginning to discover viruses and bacteria, and were beginning to understand how the immune system combats these germs. Major public health initiatives were just getting underway. The John Hopkins School of Public Health had been founded, and the Rockefeller Institute was making new types of research possible. It was not the Dark Ages.The other major piece of historical context is, of course, the First World War. Undoubtedly this played a major role in the epidemic. Not only did troop movements help to spread the disease, but press censorship virtually guaranteed that communities were unprepared. Barry notes how newspapers all across the country consistently downplayed the danger, which ironically only further increased panic. (The pandemic is sometimes called the “Spanish flu,” because the press in neutral Spain was uncensored, and so reported freely on the disease.) The war effort overrode all of the warnings of disease experts; and by the time the disease struck many communities, most of the available doctors and nurses had been sent to the military.Barry’s narration mainly focuses on the United States. Partly this is because this is where he believes the disease originated (there are several competing theories), partly this is because the disease’s impact in Europe was overshadowed by the war, and partly this is simply because of the amount of easily available sources. I did wish he had spent more time on other countries—especially on India, which suffered horribly. The sections on science—both on the history of science, and summarizing what we know now about flu viruses—were in general quite strong. What was lacking, for me, were sections on the cultural impact of the disease.But perhaps there are not so many. As Barry notes, no major novelist of the time—Hemingway, Fitzgerald, Lawrence—mentioned the pandemic in their works. I have noticed the same thing myself. I cannot recall a single mention of this flu in biographies and autobiographies of people who lived through the pandemic, such as John Maynard Keynes or even John D. Rockefeller (who personally funded research on the disease). This is perhaps understandable in Europe, where the deaths from the pandemic were swallowed up in news of the war; but it seems odd elsewhere. What is more, the pandemic did not seem to exacerbate existing racial or class tensions. In many ways the virus seems to have swept through communities and then disappeared from memory.(Barry does have one fairly controversial claim in the book: that Woodrow Wilson contracted the flu while negotiating the treaty of Versailles, and that it caused him to capitulate to Clemenceau’s demands. If this is true, it would be a major historical consequence.)It is illuminating to compare the 1918 pandemic to the current crisis. There are many similarities. Both are caused by easily transmissible viruses, and both spread around the world. The H1N1 flu virus and the SARS-CoV-2 virus both infect the respiratory system, causing fever, coughing, and in severe cases pneumonia and ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome). In both cases, no vaccine is available and no known treatment is effective. As in 1918, doctors are turning desperately to other therapies and medicines—those developed for other, unrelated diseases like malaria—and as in 1918, researchers are publishing at a frantic pace, with no time for peer review. Police are again wearing masks, hospitals are again overrun, and officials are struggling to catch up with the progress of the virus.But of course, there are many important differences, too. One is the disease itself. The 1918 flu was almost certainly worse than the novel coronavirus. It was more deadly in general, and it killed younger people in far greater numbers—which resulted in a much bigger dip in life expectancy. (Young people died because their immune systems overreacted in what is called a “cytokine storm.”) The H1N1 flu also had a far shorter incubation period. This meant that the gap between infection and the first symptoms was short—often within 24 hours—and patients deteriorated far more quickly. Barry describes people being struck down within mere hours of showing their first symptoms. The challenge of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, however, is the very long incubation period—potentially up to two weeks—in which people may be infectious and yet not show symptoms. This makes it very difficult to keep track of who has it.The explanation for this difference lies in the nature of the virus. A virus is basically a free-floating piece of genetic code incased in a protein shell. It needs to highjack animal cells in order to reproduce; and it infiltrates cells using proteins that link up with structures on the cells’ surface. Once inside, the virus begins to replicate until the cell literally bursts, spilling virus into adjacent cells, which in turn get infected, and which in turn burst. Each burst can release thousands of copies. The rate at which the virus replicates within the cells determine the incubation period (between first infection and first symptoms), and coronaviruses replicate significantly more slowly in animal cells, thus explaining the slower onset of symptoms. Their greater speed also means that flu viruses change faster, undergoing antigenic drift and antigenic shift, meaning that new strains of the virus are inevitable. The novel coronavirus is (likely) more stable.Another potential difference is seasonality. Flu viruses come in seasonal waves. The 1918 virus struck first in spring, receded in summer, and then returned in autumn and one last time in the winter of 1919. Every wave hit very quickly—and then left just as quickly. Most cities experienced a sharp drop-off in cases after about six weeks of the first patients. The seasonality of the 1918 flu was partly a result of the genetic drift just mentioned, as the different waves of this flu were all at least subtly different strains of the virus. Atmospheric conditions—humidity and temperature—also presumably make some difference in the flu virus’s spread. COVID-19 may exhibit a very different pattern. It may, perhaps, be less affected by atmospheric conditions; and if it mutates and reproduces more slowly, it may linger around for one long wave rather than several short ones. This is just my speculation.Well, so much for the virus. How about us? The world has changed a lot since 1918. However, not all of those changes have made us better prepared. Fast and cheap air travel allowed the virus to spread more quickly. And economic globalization did not help, either, as both medicines and medical equipment are often produced overseas and then imported, thus rendering countries more vulnerable to supply-chain disruption than in the past. As we witness countries and states compete for supplies, this vulnerability is very apparent.But of course we have many advantages, too. Many of the deaths caused by the flu and the coronavirus are not from the virus infection itself, but because the virus renders us vulnerable to secondary infections by bacteria, causing pneumonia. Antibiotics (which did not exist in 1918) can save many lives. Another advantage is medical care. The most severe patients of both epidemics were struck with ARDS, a condition with an almost 100% mortality rate for those who do not receive intensive medical care (using a ventilator machine). In 1918 they were able to administer oxygen, but far less effectively than we can. Even so, even with the best intensive care, the survival rate of ARDS is between 40-60%. And our ability to administer intensive care is quite limited. The ventilator shortage has become a global emergency in itself, as hospitals are overrun.Medical science has also advanced considerably. Now we can isolate the virus (which they could not do in 1918), test individuals for it, and work on a vaccine. However, testing has so far been unable to keep up with the virus. And the most optimistic estimate of an available vaccine is in a year. Arguably a much bigger advantage is information technology. The press is not censored—so citizens have a much better idea of the risks involved—and experts can communicate with each other in real time. We can coordinate large-scale societal responses to the pandemic, and can potentially even use technology to track individual cases. As we come to better understand the virus, we will be able to use more sophisticated statistical methods to understand its progress. None of this was possible in 1918.One thing that we will have to contend with—something that is hardly even mentioned in Barry’s book—is the economic toll that this virus will take. Even in the ugliest days of the 1918 pandemic, governments did not require businesses or restaurants to close. War preparations went on unabated. (In 1918, after years of slaughter and at the height of the war, life was simply cheaper than it is now.) Our societal response will likely mitigate the health crisis but will create a secondary economic crisis that may ultimately be more difficult to solve. The solutions to this crisis could be our most lasting legacies. Already Spain’s government is talking of adopting universal basic income. Though of course it is far too early to predict anything with confidence.Comparisons with 1918 are partly depressing, and partly uplifting. Depressing, because we knew this was possible and did not prepare. Depressing, because so many governments have gone through the same cycle of early denial and disorganized response as they did back then. Uplifting, because we do know much more than we did. Uplifting, because—after our early fumbles—we are finally coordinating as a global community to deal with the crisis. Perhaps most uplifting of all, despite some ugly stories here and there, the crisis has revealed a basic sense of solidarity in the face of a universal threat. Hopefully, unlike 1918, we will not do our best to forget about this one."

12,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/269235-david-schaafsma,3,"“Oh, it’s just influenza”--millions of people, some of them quoted in this bookSo now during this 2020 pandemic I have not just read Great Novels and comics, but have delved for almost the first time into non-fiction books about medical history. I read Crisis in the Red Zone by Richard Preston about the 2014 Ebola Crisis centered in West Africa; I read the novelistic account of the medieval plague, A Journal of My Plague Year by Daniel DeFoe, I reread the fictional but moving The Plague by Camus, and now this (though I may also read David Quammen’s Spillover still before I am done).My main take-away from this book: I will never ever glibly decide not to get a flu shot ever ever again. My basic argument against getting one historically was that the vaccine make-up seemed to me, a non-scientist, a kind of guesswork,as it covers only some random strains (and I just have never liked getting shots). This book reminded me that anywhere from 50-100 million died from particular strains of Influenza 1918-1919. The numbers are sketchy because a lot of people were dying at the time, public health (and medicine, epidemiology, science research) was less developed, and people didn’t have our (very.very useful, trust me) obsession with counting the dead and dying we have today. But now we know it was at least 50 million and probably closer to 100 million, but let’s just say it was 50, in comparison to today’s population, that would be like 72 million had died in the last year and a half. Though we are still not yet into the second wave, really, so our worldwide numbers of deaths could well exceed a million (or many more).This book is really two books. A generous way of thinking of it is that it puts the “Spanish Flu” pandemic in the context of medical history, which is to say that it is as much about the still fledgling fields of scientific research and medicine we need to help us survive as a human race as it is a history of that particular pandemic. Barry romanticizes people like William Welch for playing a key role in modernizing the field of medicine in the US, and he names other key players in the development of various related fields needed to prepare us for surviving future pandemics, but none of these folks figure in all that much in the story of the pandemic itself, as they didn’t discover a cure or really impact the massive death rate. The book does give us a sense of how we need to fund science research in the area of pandemics because Covid-19 is by no means the last one we will see.This argument happens in the last third of the book,which returns us to the development of medical research, which is as I said pretty disconnected from the middle of the book, the second whole book, on the history of the pandemic as it occurred mainly in the US. This book reveals the political contexts in which the disease took place and shows us how the disaster could have happened. What can we learn from it?!Some other fun facts:*It killed more people in twenty-four months than AIDS killed in twenty-five years, more in a year than the Black Death killed in a century.”*The main way to beat a Pandemic is isolation, avoiding crowds, avoiding driving your Harley to Sturgis, SD with 300K other bikers to party and then superspreading it across the country and globe. Only in America? Well, in Brazil and in other macho-oriented cultures it seems to be happening, too. Anyway, why was there no death in Gunnison, Colorado? They stayed inside and kept visitors out until things were safe. Same with a private girl’s school in Maryland. No deaths. The countries that did that had fewer casualties, big surprise,*Arizona, now a red state, got the idea then to wear masks and so their infection and death rate was much lower than other states. Sure, because this is America and you know, Live Free and Die, there was an Anti-Mask League then, but some people really did begin to figure out what to do and not to do. *The Great Influenza, Barry says, started here, in Kansas, and spread to almost every corner of the world.*One key reason for the spread is the inaction, half-truths and lies by politicians and lazy or ignorant public health officials supported by various co-opted media. MIs-information abounds. Not much was known about what to do about the flu, initially, but this did not prevent people from spreading lies and proposing unfounded solutions. “It’s almost over, it’s not that bad, it’s only the flu!”*The state of medical education by the beginning of the twentieth century was terrible. You didn’t even need any college coursework to be a doctor, you didn’t have to see a single patient or do any medical research to become a doctor. Doctors and nurses were way underpaid, and so necessary, but there was a severe shortage when this hit and the health care system was overwhelmed.*As with our current pandemic people focused on whether you live or die, but long term neurological and other effects may have been as serious as the number of deaths..*The Red Cross was terrific even when government public health sucked.*Over time, over waves of infection, as people, increasingly terrified, began to take it seriously and stop hanging out in large crowds together, as businesses and schools closed and people stayed inside, the pandemic sort of mutated and went away (though it could come back at any time)*Ebola, SARS, Avian Flu, and on and on, are definitely changing life as we knew it; ignore this at your peril. A vaccine might help, but isolation is the best strategy for saving your and others’ lives. Humans: Develop a little discipline and willingness to self-sacrifice and get over your anti-science arrogance and let’s come together to do the right thing. How--as of today has New Zealand had new cases in six weeks? Guess! Fairy dust, right!*There was WWI taking place, so President Woodrow Wilson made a decision to put all our resources into winning the war rather than saving people’s lives at home. And many many soldiers died, too, and Wilson and the military took most of the doctors and nurses to the front and lied to the American public that it wasn’t that bad and insisted people only say positive things in spite of the obvious rising death totals. *Wilson also got the flu, which was kept secret for a long time, but we now know it affected him neurologically; in other words, decisions he made were flu-influenced. He died of a stroke that was likely brought on by the flu he largely tried to ignore.*More people die of disease in wars than from guns, and very little money ever goes to military medicine. But you already know more money goes to the defense budget than public health.*The book focuses on the US instead of the whole world but it is already 460 pages so i guess that can pass, but if it just focused on the pandemic it could have looked at things more globally.*A lot of novelists wrote about The Great War, but why is so little written about the far greater killer, The Great Influenza? Note to self: Reread Katherine Anne Porter’s Pale Horse, Pale Rider. She writes a novella about her experience with it and obviously not dying from it.*Barry in 2004 while finishing this book said, “It’s time to start spending serious money on influenza.” We didn’t do it. In fact the current POTUS defunded the Pandemic organization that might have helped us prepare better for these events. And broke off the US from the WHO! This book is a good book, but it should just be one book, the history of the pandemic, rather than two books. It is obviously based on a lot of research, but it is not as well written as the other books I mention at the outset. It needs editing, The medical history goes on too long, he romanticizes science researchers and adds some melodramatic effects in places that distracted me. Why spend so much time on, for instance, Paul Lewis and others who were “original,” “brilliant,” but didn’t come up with a vaccine and had almost no impact on the progression of the disease itself. But I still learned a lot from it, from both of the books, truthfully."
13,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/545336-mike,2,"I read many of the reviews of The Great Influenza: The Epic Story of the Deadliest Plague in History. Many reviews are on target, the book just doesn't meet expectations for what should be a powerful tale. Unless you already have the book, I wouldn't rush to get it. How can I characterize it? Pompous, pretentious, repetitive, bloated,...? It seems he is trying to write like Simon Winchester, bringing in various threads to make a colorful tapestry. Except it is threadbare, strained, frayed. Just didn't work for me. A real shame because the story deserves a powerful telling.There was one part that was outstanding. His description of Woodrow Wilson's administration and the Progressive hell that enveloped the US leading up to and during WWI was absolutely chilling and precise. The Espionage Act, the American Protective League, the associated American Vigilance Patrol, the Four-minute men, the Committee on Public Information… I don’t know if Barry intended to paint such a chilling picture of the rise of propaganda, censorship and government force but he does an excellent job.Just 2 Stars for me. Darn it, was hoping it would be amazing."
14,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16092014-paul,2,"It was a book, only a book.I have to keep telling myself this because even though author John M. Barry apparently felt like he was writing the tome to end all tomes about this chapter in world history – including the hideous phrase, ""It was influenza, just influenza"" over and over and over again – in the end, what he created was a terrific 200-page story of the world's deadliest pandemic wrapped in 250 pages of overwritten irrelevance.Barry spent seven years working on this book, and it shows. By which I mean it's meticulously researched, thoroughly detailed – and very poorly edited. It's clear he was too invested in his work and failed utterly at even the most basic test of what was relevant to his thesis. Thus we have short books about the history of Johns Hopkins University and modern medicine, about the failed response of the scientific community to the flu pandemic, and about the flu pandemic itself and the political and military decisions that exacerbated it. This latter is a five-star book – tightly written, cogent, fascinating and novel-like in its intensity while still lucidly explaining the mechanism of influenza infection and the immune system's response – but the rest should have been excised.In addition to the massive editing failure this book represents, Barry seems to understand on some level that his work is all head, no heart. It's about scientists and science, and cares very little for the actual people who got sick and died during the pandemic. The result, however, is to overwrite his descriptions of the flu's effects on cities like Philadelphia. He finds a rhetorical trick and hammers it home well past the point of overuse. He constantly uses ""for"" instead of ""because,"" which trips up the reader.By the end of the book, I was skimming pretty heavily. Despite flashes of brilliance, The Great Influenza is a book, only a book, and not one worth the time required to invest in it. "
15,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50297885-joy-d,4,"Comprehensive look at the influenza pandemic of 1918-1920 that resulted in the deaths of an estimated 50 million people worldwide. The author starts with a history of medical science, describing the common thoughts of the time immediately preceding the pandemic, and documenting the improvements made by notable institutions and scientists of the day. He traces the origins of the disease, likely in Kansas, and the spread of the disease through transfer and deployment of American military personnel in WWI. A good portion of the book is devoted to the science of viruses (what they look like under a microscope, how they mutate, and how they infect a host), research methodology, and the many ways people tried to curtail the proliferation of the disease. He takes politicians and newspaper representatives to task for failing to tell citizens the truth. In fact, it ended up being called “Spanish flu” due to the fact that “only the Spanish newspapers were publishing accounts of the spread of the disease that were picked up in other countries.” He analyzes how society reacted to the overwhelming challenges created by the pandemic, and what lessons can be learned from it. Leadership is important, especially during a crisis, and it was sorely lacking in many instances. The portion of the book focused in the influenza outbreak is the most effective. Barry paints a disturbing picture of the horrors created by the rapid contagion: “But the most terrifying aspect of the epidemic was the piling up of bodies. Undertakers, themselves sick, were overwhelmed. They had no place to put bodies. Gravediggers either were sick or refused to bury influenza victims. The director of the city jail offered to have prisoners dig graves, then rescinded the offer because he had no healthy guards to watch them. With no gravediggers, bodies could not be buried. Undertakers’ work areas were overflowing, they stacked caskets in halls, in their living quarters—many lived above their businesses.”This book gives highlights the contributions of a number of scientists that may not be familiar to many readers. It points out some of the discoveries that came out of research dedicated to isolating the source of this virulent version of influenza, such as how DNA carries genetic code. I am impressed by the amount of research that went into this book, as documented in the extensive footnotes and bibliography. At times, it gets a bit scattered and repetitive, and the author digresses into areas not directly related to the influenza epidemic, but overall it provides a detailed analysis of what happened and cautions us not to become complacent. If anyone wants motivation to get the annual flu vaccine, this book will provide plenty of rationale. It will appeal to those with an interest in science or the history of medicine. If reading it for the historical significance, be prepared for lots of scientific details."

What were the circumstances? Why did so many young people die, when usually it’s infants and the elderly?I was hoping this book would answer those questions, and in part, it did. However, I really did not need a history of medicine in general (back to Galen?!), laboratory medicine in particular, and medical colleges in America. This took up almost the first third of the book and IMHO was really unnecessary. Synopses of the main physicians trying to isolate the organism that caused the pandemic would have been sufficient. For this reason, the book only gets 4 stars.When we do get to the history of the pandemic, the statistics just get mind-boggling: as many as 8 to 10 percent of all young adults alive at the time succumbed to the flu. Approximately two-thirds of the deaths occurred in a 24-week period. People who awoke healthy were often dead within two to four days, some within 12 HOURS. The flu “killed more people in a year than the Black Death of the Middle Ages killed in a century; it killed more people in twenty-four weeks than AIDS...killed in twenty-four years.” Priests drove down the street in Philadelphia calling out for people to bring out their dead, just like the Middle Ages. Many cities came to absolute standstills. Even after reading this book, I can’t wrap my head around how awful the Great Influenza was, and can only worry about our preparedness for the next time the virus mutates into an unrecognizable form.

17,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/196350-sara-w,2,"Getting a little boring, so I'm taking a break from it. I think I expected a social history (how everyday people dealt with the flu, how it affected communities, etc.), and instead it's a very detailed history of medicine at the time (and well, well before the time of the flu!). I think I made it through a good 1/4 to 1/3 of the book (or more) before the Spanish flu began to get mentioned. The focus is on the medicine and doctors (individuals and as a profession - you get the whole history of U.S. medical schools) at the time. While interesting in its own right, it's not what I expected. The title is a little misleading considering how much of this book does not cover the Great Influenza. In addition, the book seems to jump around weirdly, so it's a little hard to keep track of things. I agree with the other reviews which mention the poor editing. I'm planning on finishing the book at some point (at least skimming it) because portions of it are interesting and what I was looking for."
18,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2048362-a-l-sowards,0,"I thought this would be a history of the misnamed Spanish flu of 1918 (it originated in the US, but since Spain was one of the few countries not at war and not censoring information, it took that country’s name). This book included information about the epidemic, but also extensive details about the founding of Johns Hopkins and the Rockefeller Institute and the men (and at least one woman) involved in those organizations. I had been hoping for the story of the epidemic all over the world, but this account was focused on the US with only minimal attention for other regions. I thought the parts about the epidemic were interesting, but I found the writing style repetitive and long-winded. Rounding up to 3 stars. "

Okay, the metaphor doesn't really work with the ""bogged down by details"" part, but other than that, it's apt.In attempts to create a rhythm, and strike a melodic note with his writing, Barry uses phrases he thinks are poignant to the point of annoyance. It's honestly like that Debbie Gibson song ""Shake Your Love."" Well, John M. Barry, you're not shaking my love anymore.He does Shake My Love during the best parts of the book: the graphic details of the disease itself. But when it comes to relaying the nature of it's affects on various cities and people, it certainly unshakes my love. Unshakes my love with a passion.The subject matter tends to be so new and fascinating that it keeps you reading, and the 2nd third of the book is worth the time spent on the rest. All told, let's just say I hope there isn't another devestating influenza like the one of 1918-1919 so we don't have to sit through another John M. Barry retelling of it.Oh, and also 'cause the 50+ million deaths sounds pretty shitty."
20,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2187043-mike-the-paladin,3,"I hesitate to go 3 starts on this book, but for what it is it's a good book. The thing is (and I've seen other reviewers here say the same thing) it's not what I would call ""primarily"" about the 1918/1919 Influenza pandemic. That's what I was ""primarily"" interested in.My grandparents and great grandparents lived through this time. My grand-aunt lived into her 90s and close to 100. She was one of those people (and most of us have known them) who seemed to have a ""cast iron constitution"". She was seldom sick and when she was she generally didn't slow down much for it. She wouldn't speak about a lot of her past and that included the flu epidemic (that generation seemed to be big on stoicism). When we asked she spoke about it a little. She was a young woman/older girl and was the one who ended up taking care of her whole family. She spoke of the bodies and how they couldn't all be buried and were stacked about. I got this book because I wanted to know more about the epidemic. This book however is more about the state of medical science in the 18th, 19th and early 20th century. It covers the changes and the discoveries these changes drove science to. About halfway through the book we get to some direct text on the pandemic itself but the author is more interested in the state of medicine in general. The story of the book carries on well past the epidemic but not primarily about the effects of the pandemic itself but the effect on medical science and the doctors who were involved in research.So it was fairly interesting and it tells the story that it tells very well. I would like however to find a book more concerned about the pandemic itself. We do get some information of that type here, don't let me mislead you. I'd say maybe 25% of the book is concerned with the flu, how it spread and the idiotic bureaucratic mistakes that added to it's spread. The facts of life for the people who lived with it, the situations like small cities that simply set out armed guards and cut themselves off from the outside. It's here but not the primary focus. I guess I'll keep looking.Three stars but good for what it is. "

We always thought that things cant get much worse, but reality surprises us. The researches, methods that was done back then may seem medieval , but it was what they had then. Where are we with all this cutting edge technologies in 2020? I live in a country where students choose to read life science if they dont get into other disciplines(not talking about physicians). This should change. We should encourage kids reading about science from an early age. Not just doctors and engineers. We need some scientists of our own. Period."
22,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/96247178-indra-nooyi,4,"I recently read The Great Influenza by John M. Barry, which tells the story and reminds us of the tragic toll of the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic. This book was an incredible walk through history, and there are profound sections that I have read and re-read over the past few weeks. This quote in particular struck a chord with me throughout my involvement with the Reopen Connecticut Advisory Group: ""To have any chance in alleviating the devastation of the epidemic required organization, coordination, implementation."" I’d highly recommend this book and hope it provides you a lens through which to see the current COVID-19 crisis and the ways we get through it, as it did for me. "

(I'm having flashbacks to Sean Wilentz and his freaking ""The Democracy."")ETA: 40% in and we're finally starting to deal with the flu epidemic. That's a long set-up section!"
24,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58158333-allen,4,"There are still aspects to the 1918/19 ""Spanish""flu pandemic that elude us. It likely originated in Kansas, not Spain. It killed more civilians than soldiers and was the 20th Century's most lethal pandemic except for AIDS. Even today, we are still dealing with its after-effects as it mutates and returns to attack human beings every few years, making vaccines only partially effective. THE GREAT INFLUENZA is a fascinating book, not lacking in detail. It is unlikely that the death count would have been so high if not for the massive population shifts brought on by World War One, the overcrowding of soldiers, and President Woodrow Wilson's intransigence in insisting on total victory despite the fact that the Central Powers were on the verge of collapse. The only real gripe I have with this book is that it's awfully long -- 546 pages -- with antecedents in other plagues and epidemics in Europe's prior centuries. You'll also learn a lot about how bacteria and viruses function, and how the great 20th Century epidemiologists set out to tame them. Try to get this revision (2018) of the book, which is right on the money about topics that still plague us: whether schools should be closed in a pandemic, and whether the USA keeps on hand enough personal protective equipment to protect the population (no, the author avers). In an age of Covid-19, we should all have listened."
25,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10770371-dan,4,"The Great Influenza by John Barry is an important book that is equal part history and equal part science discussing the 1918 Flu. The book is written almost exclusively about the American impacts towards and from the flu. The book spends more than half the pages discussing immunologists and their groundbreaking work on infectious diseases, especially influenza and pneumonia. As a result it took Barry a few hundred pages to hit the meat of the book.We learn that the deadly strain of 1918 influenza killed more than 5% of the world’s population in less than a year and that influenza viruses over time become significantly less fatal but this strain was still killing people by the thousands more than two years later.We learn that some places like Australia and Gunnison Colorado escaped the flu because of complete quarantines. Infected people never got through. But there were three cases in Alaska where in villages, every single person died and another twelve villages the death rates were 85%. The city of Philadelphia was also hit exceptionally hard. In just one day, October 10th, over 700 people died from the 1918 influenza.We also learn that the deadly strain originated in Haskell County Kansas in very early 1918 and was spread to nearby military bases in Kansas and then to those bases deploying troops to Europe and then across the pond to France where soldiers died by the hundreds of thousands from a more virulent strain. The virus returned to the U.S and around the world where millions died. I found the chapters that comprised the last 1/3 of the book, The Tolling of the Bell and Lingerer, and which documented the horrific effects of the 1918 strain to be absolutely superb.This book was ambitious and the author succeeded in telling us both the stories of the scientists behind the rush to stop the outbreak and the anecdotal stories that captured the human costs. Some patience is required to get to the most rewarding part towards the end of the book. The author said he took seven years to research and write this book and it shows.4.5 stars."
26,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10407443-ross-blocher,4,"From our vantage point in the midst of the Coronavirus pandemic, we can't help but look back to the most devastating pandemic in modern history for warnings, perspective, and perhaps a glimmer of hope. Just as the Great Depression brackets our perception of economic declines (we're in one of those, too), the 1918-1919 influenza outbreak, with its worldwide death toll of 50 million, serves as a haunting reminder of just how bad things can get. That number could credibly go as high as 100 million: the swift progress of its devastation and poor record-keeping of the time make it impossible to know for sure. In The Great Influenza: The Story of the Deadliest Pandemic in History, John M. Barry presents what is known about the virus's origin, spread, and impact - primarily through the lens of the scientists and doctors who attempted to combat the disease - in ways that paint parallels to our current predicament.Given the moniker ""The Spanish Flu"", one might be excused for thinking the disease came from overseas. In this case, Spain was punished for its honesty: at the time, its newspapers were the only ones reporting accurate death statistics. The most likely source of the pandemic was Haskell County, Kansas, which experienced an outbreak of pneumonia and ""lagrippe"" back in January of 1918. The disease killed nearly a third of those who contracted it, but by March the small town thought it was back to normal. With a seven day shedding (transmission) period, the influenza might have died there, except for a few young men who left for an army training facility, Camp Funston, 300 miles away. Once established there, the virus cut its way through forts and encampments, mocking quarantine efforts. Having had time to mutate from its initial form into something more deadly, the new strain inverted the usual death curve, attacking the 20-40 year olds who are typically less susceptible to influenza. The symptoms set in quickly and violently, with racking coughs, headaches, fever, body aches and inflamed eyelids. The lungs were the real target, with victims' bodies weakened to the point at which bacterial infections took over (enter pneumonia) and oxygen could no longer make its way into the body. As a result, many victims turned blue before they died. Once the virus had established itself in military camps, filled with tens of thousands of soldiers, the rest was history. Influenza spread to hospitals and into the civilian population, and any woman with nurse-adjacent experience was pressed and begged into service. Influenza traveled via troop ships (oh man, the ship stories are awful) to the front of the Great War, and from there to the rest of the world.While ostensibly about the 1918 pandemic, The Great Influenza has also swallowed a book about the creation of the US medical establishment. Barry walks us through an abbreviated history of world medicine, highlighting long stretches of error punctuated by occasional, cumulative insights. By the late 19th century, medicine in the US was far behind its European counterparts, with no prominent medical schools or accreditation. Most doctors had little education, let alone practical experience, before being unleashed on the public. Johns Hopkins University was founded in 1876, and prominent scientist Thomas Huxley arrived from England to deliver an opening address in which he exhorted America to lay claim to the honesty and curiosity of the scientific method. One of the founding professors of Johns Hopkins' medical school, William Henry Welch, executed this charge with great enthusiasm. Though he made only modest contributions to medicine himself, Welch was adept at training a generation of enthusiastic and bright physicians (Simon Flexner, George Whipple, Walter Reed, Peyton Rous, Paul Lewis, George Sternberg and others) who would go on to found medical schools and to win Nobel prizes. The book goes into great detail about these men, their methods, their labs and their discoveries. I will gloss over much of that information here.Alas, despite much valiant effort to understand and combat the 1918 influenza, history does not give us a nice, clean, solved ""whodunnit"" mystery. The disease ended because it had run its course and faded into the background (only to resurface in later flu strains, which is a separate and fascinating story), not because of man's scientific triumph over nature. Throughout the initial waves of the pandemic, there was still confusion about what its causative agent was. First came the debate over whether this was truly influenza, which was known as a very mild disease. Then the prime suspect became ""Pfeiffer's bacillus"", now Haemophilus influenzae, a bacterium discovered by much-respected German physician Richard Pfeiffer half a century earlier. Scientists had successfully extracted blood serum from survivors of dysentery and gangrene and replicated it inside of horses to create antiserums and antitoxins. This same process was attempted using the bacillus, with only modest results that helped alleviate some cases of pneumonia (serum immunity is one temporary method of preventing COVID-19 today). Only a few researchers suspected that the disease might be caused by a virus, but the influenza virus was not isolated until 1933.Looking to the past, there is cause for hope. We are fortunate to know exactly what our enemy is and can track its genetic shifts in real time. While COVID-19 is hard to detect, easy to spread, and we do not yet have a vaccine, the task is set for our scientists, and many vaccines have advanced quickly as candidates. We know about the effectiveness of distance, masks, and sanitation, and are able to conduct much of our activities over the internet. At the time of writing, today's virus has claimed some 800,000 lives worldwide and 180,000 in the US: numbers that would would have been much higher a century ago. On the other hand, those numbers are much higher than they should be today. Particularly in the US, we face a crisis of leadership and a significant population that refuses to learn the lessons of science and history. In this respect it was sad to see parallels to 1918. Citizens were resistant to masks and other public health measures even then (masks were a new public health measure, but the gauze wrappings of the time had only limited prophylactic effect), and President Woodrow Wilson refused to acknowledge or address the threat. In a strange twist, Barry relates an unexpected story of how the influenza may have set the stage for World War II. When Wilson traveled to the Paris Peace Conference in 1919, he was dead set against recriminating punishments for the German people, arguing for days against French Prime Minister Georges Clemenceau. During that trip, Wilson took ill with influenza. He began to demonstrate some of the madness that had affected others, even slipping into conspiratorial delusions. The illness altered his personality, and when talks resumed, Wilson conceded all the points he had argued so strongly against before. Germany was saddled with a crushing debt for the war that set the stage for the next global conflict. Perhaps, as some say, it was a stroke... or perhaps just one more deadly legacy of the great influenza."
27,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18772957-kimba-tichenor,2,"The title is a bit of a misnomer. Although the Great Influenza of 1919 was a pandemic, the author focuses exclusively on its history in the United States. As several other reviewers have noted, this book could have benefited from a good edit. A significant share of the book focuses on the history of medicine in the United States prior to the Great Influenza, providing biographical information on medical researchers both who would play a role in trying to find an effective treatment for the disease as well as many who did not. Perhaps a good editor could have also reined in the author's tendency to focus on graphic descriptions of the presenting symptoms of the disease. Page after page describe the color of various bodily secretions, etc. While it is understandable that the author wanted the reader to appreciate the severity of this strain of flu, too much of this type of detail reduces the narrative to a sensationalist account aimed at making the reader feel squeamish. At least for this reader, it would have been more interesting if the author had focused more on the social, cultural, and political ramifications of this pandemic in the US and elsewhere and less on pus and other secretions."
28,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1241339-clif,4,"John Barry is in love with science and we are the beneficiaries in this comprehensive account of the influenza epidemic that came at the end of WWI. Some of his prose is quite lyrical when he praises the scientific method and the virtue of rational thinking combined with imagination in some of the researchers he covers.But there are villains as well as heroes here as we enter an earlier time where government did almost nothing while private initiatives and funding allied with individual effort to fight disease. You'll get a view of the Wilson administration and the issues of post-war politics. You'll discover the primitive state of American medicine at the turn of the 20th century. You'll learn why the Germans and the French were far ahead in medical research in the beginning of the book and how one American was instrumental in pulling together the human and financial resources to advance the training of a group of American doctors to equal that of the Europeans.Any history should teach the reader a thing or two and this book excels in that. Medical terms are introduced and carefully explained as are the basic concepts of genetics. How does a virus attack a healthy cell and why does a virus mutate so rapidly that any drug is hard-pressed to remain effective even over a period of months? You'll find out.I happened across an article in a current newspaper dealing with the attempt to find a vaccine that would be effective against all viruses and to my surprise I found I understood all of the terms because I had read this book.Written with an intensity and urgency that will keep your attention, The Great Influenza deserves a read."
29,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/259402-sebastien,4,"Solid read (and timely I suppose). Fascinating some of the parallels with the US's political response (read mismanagement/lies) between the 1918 pandemic and the 2020 COVID19 pandemic. Selfish political interest coming before public health, a sad pattern we see too often. There are also some interesting potential parallels between these two virus pandemics regarding the issue of cytokine storms: an over-reactive immune response being a central issue in causing severe disease (and in some people death). Maybe the predisposition to the cytokine storms from specific allergens/pathogens/toxins is based on particular immune system genetic subtypes? Hopefully there will be some research on that angle.Recommend the book. Nice historical overview and provides some added historical context for the current pandemic."
30,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72479728-bryan-alkire,3,"Turned out to be ok, but given my high expectations for the book, ultimately disappointing. Before I get talk about the book itself, I’d like to say a few words about the peril of popular historical analogy. Really, this current Corona virus and the 1918 flu are not equivalent. Different diseases different times different responses. For starters, 1918 was a war economy. If people had chirped about lack of toilet paper or individual rights to be out and about, they would have been swiftly muzzled. Second, the government involvement at the federal level was vastly different. In 1918 the federal government did absolutely nothing, tot even brave words of comfort, for civilians suffers the flu. Today the government is throwing massive amounts of money at the problem even if it is at the behest of business special interests. At least the government is trying something. In fact, the only thing similar is that local governments are bearing the brunt of the response and that said response is a patchwork and that the media is following local government lead, in 1918 largely silent about the danger, in 2020 loudly proclaiming from the rooftops about the dangers. The last difference is the most important, different diseases. The 1918 flu struck quickly with a 48 to 72-hour incubation period and often killed suddenly as short as 12 hours after symptoms largely because the body’s immune system had to mount such a vigorous defense that if killed the body in the process. This corona virus is a two-week incubation period and seems to be more of a slow and more predictable killer.  Hopefully you’re still reading at this point as I will now discuss the book. I like books on pandemics when I can find them. They’re interesting and often draw lessons, usually for apocalypse writers, but unfortunately, real life currently. I chose this book because it’s the popular definitive work on the 1918 flu and that’s where the book falls short. The The organization of this book is just bad. It’s a confusing narrative structure with no real timeline and constant doubling back and forth interspersed with chapters on diseases and the like. It’s extremely repetitive. The writing is uneven. Sometimes it slows admirably and at other times gets bogged down in statistics and detail. The book also becomes awfully dry at times, particularly when discussing diseases themselves in quite detailed fashion. The content is also uneven. There’s lots here which isn’t truly relevant like medical school history and the life stories of doctors whose insolvent with the flu was more administrate than actual work. In short, this book was just a mess and clearly there was no good editing done on it. This book could have been a lot better than it was. So, I give this a 3. It’s interesting and at times, quite readable and even compelling. But, it’s dismally organized and edited. It could have been much better. "
31,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12087691-wendyb,5," A must-read book for the times we live in.Starts out with maybe just a little too much background on some of the doctors involved in the 1918 flu research but still interesting info on the state of medicine at that time.Got really interesting with the info on the start of the flu and the effect on the population.In researching my family background, I discovered my grandparents' first child died in Oct 1918 of the Spanish Flu at just 12 days old. So in some small ways, this history still touches us today."
32,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5364077-connie-g,4,"The great influenza pandemic of 1918-1920 killed between 20 to 100 million people worldwide, more fatalities than any other pandemic in history. Unlike most influenza, this one targeted young people in their 20s and 30s. Although it's called the Spanish flu because the Spanish press had extensive coverage of the disease, it's thought to have originated in Kansas. Soldiers carried the disease as they traveled between crowded military facilities, then crossed the Atlantic on crowded boats to fight in World War I.Author John M. Barry also writes about the advances in medical education and medical research in the United States which occurred just before the pandemic. The Johns Hopkins Medical School and the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research were highlighted. He goes into great detail describing the lives and work of the medical researchers. While the pandemic was raging, researchers were not able to identify the viral pathogen, and many thought that the bacteria causing secondary infections was responsible. The book contains excellent descriptions of how a virus attacks human cells and replicates in the body. The mutation of viruses and the development of vaccines are also discussed.Barry also writes about the way politics and misinformation from public officials exacerbated the pandemic of 1918. Although the book was written in 2004, it has warnings that are important today during the COVID crisis. This timely book is interesting and well researched, although some readers may find there is too much detail about the medical schools and researchers."
33,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2190636-joselito-honestly-and-brilliantly,5,"The 1918 Flu Pandemic coincided with the First World War and it killed more than both the military and civilian casualties of the conflict yet while the war generated an avalanche of literature (poems, songs, music, fiction, films, biographies and autobiographies) not much serious work had been done about this pandemic until this book published in 2004.I read this a few years back and I’ve disposed of my copy already but since it was a gripping, unforgettable read, I could still recall some tidbits of information about this 1918 pandemic in relation with what we are now experiencing during the present one.First of all, and this is what is often found to be the most surprising about whatever virus was it which caused the 1918 pandemic, the most vulnerable was those who were physically fit and at the prime of their lives (think those in their 20’s or 30’s who eat healthy and go to the gym). Contrast this with with most of the present Covid 19 fatalities who are old and who had pre-existing health issues. But why is that? For some reasons, the body’s immune system or antibodies react to the 1918 virus in a weird way. They overreact or overdo things. The analogy is that when a fly (the virus) enters a house (the human body) someone drops an atom bomb (the antibodies) on it to kill the fly and because of it even the house is completely destroyed. So that is why it was the healthy and the strong who mostly died: they were the ones with stronger antibodies.Secondly, the incubation period for the 1918 virus was apparently shorter. I think there was a story in the book about someone talking gaily on a street, apparently healthy, then in just an hour or so would die there in that same place. Or a bus of healthy-looking people stopping before it reaches its destination because its driver (with 6 of its passengers) dropping dead.The 1918 pandemic killed about 100 Million people worldwide. No one knew how it was stopped. Probably it just got tired of killing people."

37,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11820811-camelia-rose,3,"A detailed book on the 1918-1919 Influenza pandemic-how it started (from Kansas, US), how it spread all over the world (through US army participating in WWI), how the US government, army, scientific society and general public dealt with the pandemic, and its lasting impact. The book is very dry to read. The writing is repetitive and it drags on and on. Part 1 is the development of American medical science (public health study, John Hopkins Medical School etc...). Part 2 is mostly US politics (Woodrow Wilson, WWI and how wartime censorship was implemented). The rest is about the pandemic. The book should be better titled as ""The Great Influenza and How the US Dealt With It"", because it covers only a little outside the United States.At least 50m people (5% world population) had been wiped out by the pandemic, which is equivalent to 390m people today. There were three waves in the pandemic, the second wave the worst. In US, the condition in East Coast was worse than the west coast. San Francisco managed relatively well among big cities in US. Scientists did not find out the pathogen until many years later. The genome of the virus was sequenced in 2005.What strikes me most is that how the US politics today regarding Covid-19 has much in common with what happened in the 1918-1919 pandemic. Human race have memories as short as those of a gold fish."

I thought this was going to read like a thriller by Michael Crichton or Dan Brown following a plucky single doctor who fights hard for his patients, makes a breakthrough, and saves the day. That's not this book because that's definitely not what happened. The book starts off with a history of medicine. I had a vague idea about this beginning with Hypocrites and then jumping to those bleeders in Period dramas that announce, ""He's not long for this world."" with much in between. But there wasn't much in between and that's the problem.    While the other sciences moved in leaps and bounds medicine did not. There were lightbulbs and trains and the doctor was still coming to bleed you. Barry gives two reasons for this stagnation. The first is the anathema of autopsy. For the longest time it was simply unthinkable to cut into and examine a human being, it was too close to butchers work. Then there was a religious stigma attached but even in the twentieth century the liberal gods spoke out against it. Hell, even today hardened cops don't like attending autopsies.The second reason is a little trickier to understand - medicine is not logical like the other sciences. Barry gives an excellent example. A doctor in the early 1900s noticed that the face flushed during fever so he reasoned that fever could be a capillary issue. To test his theory he bled his fever patients. They went pale, their temperature dropped, and they were ravenous for food and drink. A cure! He published his finding, which was easily replicated, and was much lauded by the medical community. It was perfectly logical. It was wrong. Due to this reputation for butchery, witchery, and general ineffectiveness, being a doctor was not a respected profession. Medical schools were shockingly bad pass/fail systems where teacher salaries were based on butts in seats. Things changed quickly when they changed and you'll have to read the book to find out. This was the first book I read in 2016 and here I sit on the last evening of the year trying to finish this review. It was not mere procrastination; I was daunted by how much I enjoyed, learned, and was affected by this book. I became a vegetarian for four months and switched out all my beauty products to the more expensive cruelty free lines. And that was not even the point of the book. This entire review and I haven't even mentioned the word flu. Sigh. Just read it. *special thanks to my 2015 Secret Santa Krystal!"
39,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1649751-florence,4,"This is a very frightening book. We usually consider the flu to be a non life threatening disease. Not true in 1918. The disease killed millions in a worldwide pandemic. The actual number of fatalities can never be known because medical systems were so overwhelmed that many people were dying at home without ever seeing a medical professional. The grisly details of how ordinary people suffered are in this comprehensive book. Also covered are scientific descriptions of bacteria and viruses that a reader without a scientific background can comprehend. The pandemic seemed to be a perfect storm. President Woodrow Wilson was myopically focused on victory overseas as the Great War raged on. He made a fateful decision to send ailing troops to Europe, disregarding the advice of military health experts, exponentially expanding the disease to Europe. It took over 20 years to identify the virus that causes influenza. Initially it is transferred from an animal and has the diabolic ability to rapidly mutate to a form that can be spread among humans. Can a pandemic of this scope occur again? Almost certainly."
40,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/241691-kay,3,"""One always tends to overpraise a long book because one has got through it."" – E.M. ForsterIt took me the better part of the summer to listen to this audiobook in my car (I don't drive that much) -- and I confess that it soon became more of a chore than a pleasure. I do wish there had been a competently edited abridged version, for if ever a book cried out for editing, it was this one. Some of the book's strengths, however, include the exhaustive account of how the pandemic started and spread, not to mention the effect it had on society. There was a huge amount of material on how the authorities (mostly didn't) deal with the crisis, one of the key themes of the book being that in order to deal with such a threat that the civil authorities need to be completely honest about it. Point taken, but it was repeated over and over and over.... as were the somewhat melodramatic accounts of how the bodies stacked up, what having the disease was like, what the death toll was, and so on and so forth. Another strength was the intimate portraits of key researchers who rushed to find the cause of -- and a vaccine for -- the particularly virulent strain of influenza. There was a problem, though, in that the book's entire first section was a somewhat tedious historical account of the Johns Hopkins Institute. I'm still not sure why that was necessary (and suspect it wasn't). Granted, it was good to know what the state of medicine was at the turn of the century, but such an overview certainly could have been done more concisely. I also had real issues with the way several medical researchers, and in particular Paul Lewis, were cast into ""roles"" -- with Lewis the tragic figure that the author claimed was ""the last victim"" of the pandemic. Humph!However, I did find it fascinating to read about the details and design of medical research, and in particular how viruses mutated and became more or less deadly. In fact, I wished for a bit more of that information and less of the endless parade of statistics that Barry seemed so inordinately fond of. I came to believe that he had never met a statistic he didn't like (or subsequently use). Again, I was puzzled about why the editors hadn't intervened and winnowed out the repetitious material. Scott Brick, the reader for this book, was one of the biggest irritants, however, and no doubt significantly contributed to my feeling that the book was NEVER going to end. While his voice wasn't an unpleasant one, he seemed to have a very narrow ""range"" of intonation and emphasis. In fact, it sounded like he was overemphasizing just about everything, and he had a particular way of lingering over and stressing the word ""any"" that made me want to shriek after the first few hours. I had a hard time separating my irritation with his reading from my general impatience with the book, which is probably the reason I gave this three stars rather than two -- I'm not entirely sure whose fault it was that I didn't find this as interesting as I'd expected. (Plus, as Forster noted, one DOES tend to overpraise a long book that one finally manages to finish.) If I'd been reading this book rather than listening to it, undoubtedly I would have been able to skim pretty efficiently, slowing down for the parts that interested me the most and just skipping over the repetitive bits. But as a ""captive"" listener, it was pretty tough going. "
41,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/541670-caroline,2,"I had no less than four people come up to me while I was reading this book and tell me how great it was. Apparently it also made quite a splash at USAID when it was published. Maybe that's why three out of the four people who approached me were coworkers.It's possible these endorsements gave me unrealistic expectations, because by the time I finished it I was practically pulling my hair out. Which is a bummer because I was super excited to read The Great Influenza. I love books about medicine and medical history, so it wasn't the subject, it was what story author John Barry chose (tried?) to tell.An anecdote: Occasionally in high school, I would hit a particularly difficult calculus problem and seek out my mechanical engineer father for help. I'd show him the problem, perhaps a particularly pernicious related rate problem. Instead of starting from the problem itself, my dad always wanted to make sure I understood all of the individual concepts required to complete it. The running joke is that if I came to him with a calculus problem, he'd start no later in the material than the formal definition of a derivative and go from there. It would take several chapters worth of content before we arrived at the actual matter at hand. I still enjoy ribbing my dad about his approach to calculus assistance. He's sitting across the room from me right now and when I told him what I was writing he just grinned and declared ""First principles! You must build block by block on first principles!"" Hello, Dad who I've exaggerated for comedic effect, meet John M. Barry.John Barry started this book with Hippocrates and Galen. He then spent 166 pages getting from ancient Greece to the scientific revolution in American medicine that occurred in the early 20th century. He provides painstaking detail surrounding the creation of Johns Hopkins University (to be fair, this was pretty interesting, it's just... not the 1918 influenza pandemic). He introduces a small army of doctors, bacteriologists, and medical researchers, all of whom played a role in dragging medicine into the 20th century via the scientific method.Then, we have a mighty record scratch and Barry decides to spend about 200 pages on the 1918 epidemic itself. The majority of individuals introduced in the first section of the book take a backseat to an almost mind-numbing number of U.S. military cantonments, local and national politicians, and morbidity and mortality statistics. The level of detail is overwhelming and largely made my eyes glaze over. Frustratingly, this part of the book felt almost entirely disconnected from the medical history discussed earlier. Due to the severity of the pandemic, the carefully laboratory work according to the scientific method had to be discarded for shortcuts and best guesses. I figured Barry would highlight this irony and while he mentioned it a time or two, he for the most part just kept barreling forward through the history.Record scratch number two. With the end of the pandemic, we return to a smaller subset of the cast of characters discussed prior to its arrival and follow their lives and research down a number of paths that are only tangentially related (if at all) to influenza. Many of the most important individuals from the first part of the book are discarded without providing any sort of conclusion to their story.The whole thing was immensely aggravating. Whenever I look at a marble sculptures in art museums, I marvel at the fact that a sculptor was able to look at a block of stone, see the figure within, and get rid of the extra to reveal what was there all along. The Great Influenza felt like John M. Barry looking at a block of marble, seeing David, sculpting away, and instead revealing a figure with six arms, two heads, and feet erupting Alien-like from its chest. There are probably two and a half good books contained within, but Barry couldn't see what to get rid of and editor Wendy Wolf certainly didn't take a firm enough hand. I'm genuinely alarmed at the thought of what this book looked like pre-editor after reading the bloated and muddled final result. Here's the kicker: in the acknowledgements, John Barry pulls back the curtain on the process of writing the book and fully reveals his obliviousness. Get a load of this:""This book was initially supposed to be a straightforward story of the deadliest epidemic in human history, told from the perspectives of both scientists who tried to fight it and political leaders who tried to respond to it. I though it would take me two and a half years to write, three at the most. That plan didn't work. Instead this book took seven years to write. It has evolved (and, I hope, grown) into something rather different than originally conceived.""NO JOHN, THE NEW PLAN PLAN DIDN'T WORK. YOU SHOULD HAVE STUCK WITH THE ORIGINAL. Seven years. Holy crud.Other nits to pick: I often felt like Barry had an agenda to push. At various times in the book, he would stake out rather extreme positions and seemed to only approach the history from that angle, with Wilson's approach to World War I and the U.S. military's approach to the pandemic being two of the major examples. Were either perfect? Certainly not, but Barry seemed almost to cast them as the villains of the influenza pandemic, a practice I found unhelpful. I was also distinctly uncomfortable with an insinuation Barry made about the death of Paul A. Lewis. Implying suicide shouldn't be thrown around without evidence, and Barry provided nothing concrete. Not cool, dude.The writing is also nothing to write home about. Barry has an annoying habit of repeating anecdotes throughout the book and if I see the sentence ""It was influenza, only influenza"" one more time, I might scream.It's probably 1.5 stars but I'm rounding up. So why two instead of one? I did learn some things and a number of individual threads in the book were interesting. Highlights include a better understanding of why Johns Hopkins has the reputation it does, what the Hs and Ns are in influenza (ex: the H1N1 strain), and the word enzootic*.In all honesty, though, I'd probably pass on this one. You can learn the bulk of the 1918 influenza-specific stuff more quickly and enjoyably via Wikipedia. *It is to animals what the word ""epidemic"" is to humans, which makes sense given the roots. I'm distinctly less excited about it now, though, having just looked up the pronunciation and realized that it is pronounced en-zoh-AH-tic instead of en-ZOO-tic. I suppose you can't win them all."
42,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3244513-mike,4,"Overall this was a very good book. Expansive, thorough, and at times utterly fascinating. I'm sure people around me are completely sick of me talking about the flu at this point but this is that kind of book that will do that to you. It falls short of getting five stars for a couple of reasons, some of which are about the book but most of which are about me as a reader:1. It's almost too expansive: In Barry's quest to explore every possible nook and cranny of the 1918 Influenza pandemic he leaves no scientific idea or historical actor unearthed and thoroughly discussed. This lends to a skater shot feel to the book as you lurch from one person to another in chronological order with whole chapters about the science of viruses and bacteria popping up here and there to interrupt the forward momentum of the story. I feel like I got a about a dozen very short, somewhat shallow, biographies in this one book and a bit more science that I really wanted. 2. Lack of a supporting personal story or strong main character: When I contrast this book with Steven Johnson's ""Ghost Map"", which is all about John Snow and how he dealt with a cholera outbreak in London in the 19th Century, I find that it didn't hold my attention all the time because I didn't really connect with any of the people in the book or feel like there was a broad narrative that was pulling me along. Sure, he does a good job of showing how the pandemic began, how it peaks, and how it ebbs but the pandemic is far too amorphous for me to really relate to. And while he clearly shows how many of the people in the book react at these different phases I didn't really feel like I got to know any of them with the kind of detail that Johnson pulled out of John Snow.3. Hey, you got your science book in my history book! No, you got your history book in my science book! Wow, they're two great genres that kind of make for a confusing mess when you put them all together: Okay, this gripe is all about me as a reader. I'm WAY more interested in history and politics than science. Unless the science is about robots, zombies, or space ships at a certain point I kind of just zone out. Barry, at times, gets super deep on the science of influenza explaining in great detail how it infects the body and causes no end of problems. While it is a great feat of writing to talk about that sort of thing without losing the reader (to his credit it was never confusing) it doesn't make for a compelling read for me. When Barry talks about history in this book it's completely riveting, I literally couldn't put it down, but then there would be a speed bump science chapter and I'd have to slog through it to get back to the ideas that were the most interesting to me. It made for a frustrating read at times.Over all I would highly recommend this book. It really was quite good, my gripes aside. And, frankly, the historical implications of the book make it worth the read alone (namely that at a crucial junction in the negotiation of the Treaty of Versailles at the end of World War I Pres. Wilson came down with the flu and it, for a bunch of reasons, left him possibly permanently mentally impaired - he believed from that point on that French spies had infiltrated the White House for example - is shocking. Given that that treaty is often held directly responsible for the rise of Nazi Germany, and World War II, and that the principle features of that treaty may have caused the rise of the Nazi's were almost all pushed by the French and opposed by Pres. Wison, until his bought with the flu that is, one is left believing if not for the flu the world could have been very different). If you like science and enjoy history I think this would be a very satisfying reading experience.As an aside, I gave this book to my Grandmother for Christmas in 2009 when she was 91 years old. She and I developed a pattern late in her life of me giving her books that I'd read that I liked for birthdays and Christmas. She was an avid reader and game to read anything, although like me her preferences were more inclined to history, biography, and travel. This was one of the rare books I gave her without reading first. When I asked her, on Christmas 2011, to lend me one of her favorite books she gave me this one. She was born in April of 1918, near the beginning of this book, and I think for her the book explained a lot of things people would mention in her childhood that never made much sense (relatives who died during the flu, particular idioms people would use, or beliefs they had about sickness). She died in March of 2012 just a month shy of 94. In reading this book I am profoundly impressed by her intelligence. This book is not an easy read in spots (there were sections I read twice) and for someone who didn't even finish high school to read this book and not only understand it but enjoy it is a testament to the amazing person she was. This book still has the post-it note she always put on the inside front cover of books she got as gifts with the date, occasion, and person(s) who gave it to her. While she may be gone it makes me happy that she and I could at least share this one last experience together. "
43,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/82228946-nightlights,5,"Thought about giving this book four stars for minor repetition but last few chapters, and the afterword was so profound that it made everything even out.Early in the chapters, a mini-memoir of prominent scientists felt a bit excessive.

44,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1923002-mara,3,"Read it for a biotech class in college and really enjoyed it- I mean, it shined pretty brightly compared to my biochem textbook"
45,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/611813-melinda,4,"Re-reading again in 2020 in the middle of the coronavirus outbreak.This is an excellent book. Reading it in the time of Coronavirus is eye-opening. I wish that the shrill shrieking gerbils of the media would provide comparisons ""per population"" for their numbers, and also comparisons with the traditional flu. The 2nd half of the book is especially worthwhile in this time of pandemic.********I highly recommend this book! It reads like a ""who-done-it"", except that you know who did it (the influenza virus) and you are watching the medical scientists struggle to find solutions while the wild-fire of the 1918 influenza pandemic raged all around them. Will they find a solution in time? (see the bottom paragraph for an answer to this question)Before documenting the path of the 1918 influenza, the author lays the groundwork for the transformed medical atmosphere from the late 1800's into the early 1900's in America. This path thus shows the beginnings of the the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research, the Phipps Institute, and Johns Hopkins University. Names of medical pioneers and influenza warriors such as Paul Lewis (who proved that polio was caused by a virus in 1907 and developed a vaccine that was 100% effective in protecting monkeys), William Henry Welch (the single most powerful individual in the history of American medicine, who directed the rise of Johns Hopkins University, and who with John D. Rockefeller Jr. created the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research, arguablly the best scientific research institute in the world), Simon Flexner (first head of the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research, the man who brought the mortality rate for common bacterial meningitis down to 18% in 1919 WITHOUT antibiotics!), Rufus Cole (who made the Rockefeller Institute Hospital a model for the way clinical research is conducted), Army Surgeon General William Gorgas (whose work in abating the transmission of yellow fever and malaria by controlling the mosquitos saved hundreds of thousands of lives, and allowed construction on the Panama Canal), Oswald Avery (whose work on influenza would lead him to one of the most important scientific discoveries in the 20th century, that DNA is the material of which genes and chromosomes are made), Anna Wessel Williams (the leading female bacteriologist in the world who worked hand in hand with William Park trying to develop a serum or vaccine for influenza),William Park (teamed with Anna Wessel Williams, developed the diptheria antitoxin still in use today), andRichard Shope (who as the first to prove that a virus caused influenza) fill the pages of this book. After setting the stage with its influenza warriors and medical laboratories, the author then begins the saga of the influenza virus itself. Influenza struck in the first wave in the winter and spring of 1918, a mild ""three day fever"" form that most recovered from. The second wave hit in the fall of 1918. This wave was the most virulent and deadly. The third wave hit somewhere in the winter / spring of 1919, and was once again a less virulent form. In just 2 years the virus mutated into a super killer, then back into a more mild disease. In raw numbers, the lowest estimate of the worldwide death toll at the time was 20 million. Knowing what we know now, epidemiologists today estimate that influenza caused at least 50 million and possibly 100 million deaths worldwide. All that in a time when the population of the world was 1/3rd of what it is today. The terrifying aspect of the super killer influenza was that it did not strike the traditional victims... the old and the very young, but instead hit hardest in the age group of 20's and 30's. If the upper estimate of 100 million deaths is accurate, then 8 to 10 percent of all young adults then living were killed by the virus.And these deaths happened with blinding speed. The influenza pandemic stretched out over 2 years. But 2/3rds of the deaths occurred in a period of 24 weeks. That is about 66 million deaths in 24 weeks. Averaged out that would be 2.5 million deaths per week. Yet more than half of those 66 million deaths happened from mid-September to early December of 1918. That is really 33 million deaths in 10 to 12 weeks! That's 3.3 MILLION deaths PER WEEK in the late fall and early winter of 1918! And remember that the world population at the time was less than 1/3rd of what it is today (which is 6.8 billion people). The numbers are just staggering, and I had to keep reading them and figuring out the numbers and it still is a staggering thought. So many died in so short a time! Epidemiological evidence from the work of Dr. Loring Miner seems to show that the new influenza virus originated in Haskell County, Kansas early in the winter of 1918. Dr. Miner documented early cases of the new influenza that showed disturbing mortality rates in a very short period of time. The virus then went to a huge army base in the eastern part of the state as troops were gathered in preparation for their deployment to Europe for WWI. From that army base, soliders were sent to France, soldiers were transferred to other bases in the United States....and the disease began sweeping through North America, Europe, South America, Asia, Africa, and the entire world. Some situations requiring fast decision making in chaotic circumstances were carried out well. Other situations were not handled as well. The ins and outs of these crossing paths of decisions, deaths mounting rapidly, politics, mililtary directives, and newly formed medical laboratories make up the rest of the book. The story is staggering, but gripping. In answer to the question at the beginning of this review, the answer is ""no, the medical scientists did not find a solution during the time of the 1918 thru 1920 influenza pandemic"". They learned alot, yes. They also learned that the only way to be protected from the disease was through isolation from it. Medical practices helping and treating the ill were improved, but a vaccine was never been found. The only reason the killing influenza stopped killing was because it mutated away from the more virulent form into a milder form. So the question immediately to ask is ""what happens if the virus mutates back to the virulent form?"". And that is the question we are left with at the end of the book. In the concluding chapter, the author raises these issues and concludes tentatively that in pandemic times, an authorized power (government, World Health Organization, army, someone) must have the authority to act and to act quickly, and their decisions must trump individual freedoms. Mandatory vaccinations, mandatory quaranatine, mandatory travel restrictions are the things that must be done to protect the larger population. The ""needs of the many outweigh the needs of the one"", if I may quote a Star Trek movie. In times of such overwhelming medical need, quick decisions must be made and sometimes they must be harsh."
46,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2201886-mike,4,"[Since that book deals with epidemic disease, also. In the present there is a virulent influenza outbreak and in the past there is the plague sweeping through England. This book deals with the deadliest outbreak of virulent influenza so far which, at the time, was often thought to be a form of plague (because of extreme cyanosis). Neat, tie-in huh? (hide spoiler)]"
47,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4118002-jeanne,4,"The Great Influenza is a sobering story, especially in today’s climate. This well-researched book gives a detailed account of why this deadly pandemic devastated the world. A well-written history."
48,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10978428-jim,4,"The bodies were piling up. The undertakers, themselves falling sick, were overwhelmed. There was no place to put the bodies. Gravediggers were either sick or refused to bury the influenza victims. Caskets were stacking up...then they ran short of caskets. The city morgue filled up. The stench was terrible...this was Philadelphia, October 1918, the time of the so-called ""Spanish flu."" Barry gives us a panoramic view of the most lethal influenza outbreak in history which occurred in 1918-1919. Today we believe that the death toll in the United States was 675,000 out of a population of 105 million. As many as 100 million died worldwide out of a global population of 1.8 billion, more than 5% of the world's population.  Barry follows the movement of the flu virus across the world, starting in rural Kansas, where somehow the virus crossed the animal-human barrier (from chickens?). It erupted in an Army camp in Kansas and moved east with the soldiers and then went on the troopships with them to Europe...It came in three waves, that first wave that hit the soldiers in the spring of 1918 was rather mild. But then in the fall, there was the second wave that was much more virulent--that's when most of the deaths occurred. Then the virus mutated again and there was a third wave which hit places like Australia--which had not been hit so hard by the second wave. Much of the book is involved with the story of the scientists battling the virus. Barry goes into some detail about this and focuses on some key figures. As he explains, a revolution had occurred in American medicine where labs had been organized and work was going on with the expectation that disease could be conquered by modern science. When it came to the great influenza, science failed. We are still living with the consequences of that.  The book was published in 2004 and, in it, Barry warns that we will face another pandemic. It's only a question of when. He states that we are NOT prepared for a pandemic. The events of this year of 2020 shows that he was right."
49,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6949571-thomas-paul,5,"It killed more people in 6 months than the Black Death killed in a century. People who were young and strong were the most likely to die. In the US, 650,000 people died. The average life expectancy in the US went down by 10 years. Worldwide, perhaps 100 million people died. And yet, it was only the flu. Even today, 90 years after the epidemic, it kills 36,000 Americans in a typical year and we are hardly more prepared to face another epidemic.John M. Barry has written a fascinating account of the influenza epidemic of 1918. But the book is a lot more than just a review of the flu. Barry starts out by examining the state of the American health system at the time of the epidemic and how it reached that state. He explores the revolutionary changes to medicine that occurred in the late 19th and early 20th century and the people who led those changes. He shows us why, even today, a cure for influenza is beyond our reach, explaining in layman’s terms how the influenza virus changes to become deadly and changes again to lose that deadliness. He explains how an endemic virus can lead to an epidemic of unimagined proportions.Barry also shows how the demands of World War I on troop movements, the propaganda campaigns to keep morale high, and the failure of leaders to listen to the doctors and researchers led to a killing field of historic size. His account tends to concentrate on Philadelphia because the city was hit extremely hard and much of the research going on was near that city but he does cover other areas around the world hit hard by the virus, although his coverage of the flu outside of the US is sketchy at best. He gives us writings from diaries and newspaper articles to show what was actually happening and how the media tried to downplay the epidemic. He gives us detailed accounts of the research (and the researchers) that was done to fight the epidemic, explains why this research was mostly unsuccessful, and does it all in a way that is easy to understand even if you don’t have a medical degree.Barry likes to use foreshadowing, hints of what is to come, to keep the reader’s interest and it does work, even if it is a bit melodramatic. Even the chapter titles, “The Tinderbox”, “It Begins”, The Race”, provide some melodrama to the story. The book mostly moves at a good pace and I found myself having trouble putting it down. Barry has written a book that everyone should read, whether you are familiar with the epidemic or not. It is a fascinating, terrifying, detailed, and extremely important book."

That seems like it would be a long slog but because there was so little advancement during that time, it is done fairly quickly. As a reader with very limited knowledge of the history of medicine, I found this very interesting. What I didn't know at the beginning of the book was that the better part of the book was spent with the author going off on tangents only peripherally related to the pandemic. There is a great deal of information in this book, too much information. This book could have done with a good editor. The length of the book was about the same length as most of the books I read, and in many cases, much shorter but it didn't feel that way. It felt much longer. Barry's use of metaphor was helpful in explaining his subject and his style of writing wasn't awful as many reviewers have charged but he didn't seem to know when to stop on those threads that he followed out to what felt like oblivion at times. This is the first book I have read devoted to the subject (and may be the last). I could not recommend this book; at least not to anyone just interested in the pandemic. I can only suppose that there are better books on the topic."

53,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68316850-gavin,3,"Rousing history of one of the worst things that has ever happened: the 1918 outbreak of H1N1 flu. It focusses particularly on the great scientists who tried to fight it, none of whom I'd ever heard of. Also a meditation on epistemology, the modern mind, & the redemptive meaning of science for beasts like us.Barry senses that the headline result - one-third of the entire world infected, with 
25-100
 million dead - doesn't get enough of a rise from us. The numbers are numbing. So he couches it in modern shocking terms:
 It killed more people in twenty-four weeks than AIDS has killed in twenty-four years, more in a year than the Black Death killed in a century.
Or ten thousand 9/11s. It's worth belabouring this, because we have a weird habit of paying far more attention to human threats than natural ones, even when natural ones are far worse. (Witness our terrorism prevention budgets compared to our infectious disease control budgets, when the latter is a thousand times more lethal.)So: The 1918 flu was worse than the entire First World War: 40+ million died of flu compared with 17 million dead from war; 500 million lives damaged by flu vs 41 million lives by war. 3% of everyone alive died of flu, including about 8% of young adults(!).Except it's hard to separate the War and the pandemic. The virus was spread everywhere by unprecedented numbers of troops, and by the massive supply convoys it induced, and by the War's other human displacements. We don't know how many of the pneumonia deaths only occurred because of the logistical degradation, poverty and pestilence of wartime. There are terrible nonlinearities involved in overcrowding and global movement of troops. But add millions at least to the overall death toll caused by WWI.The book is in the epic mode, all the way through. (That's not a straightforward compliment.) I liked it, but I understand if it's a bit American for you:
Man might be defined as “modern” largely to the extent that he attempts to control nature. In this relationship with nature, modern humanity has generally been the aggressor, and a daring one at that, altering the flow of rivers, building upon geological faults, and, today, even engineering the genes of existing species. Nature has generally been languid in its response, although contentious once aroused and occasionally displaying a flair for violence.By 1918 humankind was fully modern, and fully scientific, but too busy fighting itself to aggress against nature. Nature, however, chooses its own moments. It chose this moment to aggress against man, and it did not do so prodding languidly. For the first time, modern humanity, a humanity practicing the modern scientific method, would confront nature in its fullest rage.
There's a long prelude describing how terrible medicine was up to the 20th Century. Medicine was ""the withered arm of science"". Therapeutic nihilism (that is, ""we can't really do anything"") was the only rational view, replacing millenia of Galenic woo.
Stengel reviewed dozens of ideas advanced in medical journals. Gargles of various disinfectants. Drugs. Immune sera. Typhoid vaccine. Diphtheria antitoxin. But Stengel’s message was simple: This doesn’t work. That doesn’t work. Nothing worked... Nothing they were doing worked.
Problem is, this rational scepticism created a powerful vacuum: humans need to believe something can heal, and the gap was filled with worse. Some confabulated gremlins from this time haunt us still: homeopathy, chiropractic, naturopathy, Christian Science, and (though Barry doesn't include them) the organic farming movement and psychoanalysis.Few people come off well. Even among the scientists, we get a horrible example of perverse priors and premature updating: an enormous proportion of all scientific resources were devoted to fighting the wrong pathogen, due to a bad guess by an extremely eminent researcher.Because so much of the state was occupied in war, in places there was wholesale social collapse:
In Philadelphia meanwhile fear came and stayed. Death could come from anyone, anytime. People moved away from others on the sidewalk, avoided conversation; if they did speak, they turned their faces away to avoid the other person’s breathing. The impossibility of getting help compounded the isolation. 850 Philadelphia doctors and more nurses were away in the military. More than that number were sick. Philadelphia General Hospital had 126 nurses. Despite all precautions, despite wearing surgical masks and gowns, eight doctors and fifty-four nurses—43 percent of the staff—themselves required hospitalization. Ten nurses at this single hospital died. The Board of Health pleaded for help from retired nurses and doctors if they remembered “even a little” of their profession.When a nurse or doctor or policeman did actually come, they wore their ghostly surgical masks, and people fled them. In every home where someone was ill, people wondered if the person would die. And someone was ill in every home...Starr went to Emergency Hospital #2 at Eighteenth and Cherry Streets. He did have help, if it could be called that, from an elderly physician who had not practiced in years and who brought Starr into touch with the worst of heroic medicine. Starr wouldn’t forget that, the ancient arts of purging, of venesection, the ancient art of opening a patient’s vein. But for the most part he and the other students elsewhere were on their own, with little help even from nurses, who were so desperately needed that in each of ten emergency hospitals supplied by the Red Cross only a single qualified nurse was available to oversee whatever women came as volunteers. And often the volunteers reported for their duty once and, from either fear or exhaustion, did not come again.Nearly 1/4 of all the patients in his hospital died each day. Starr would go home, and when he returned the next day, he would find that between one-quarter and one-fifth of the patients in the hospital had died, replaced by new ones... Virtually all of them, along with their friends and relatives, were terrified that, no matter how mild the symptoms seemed at first, within them moved an alien force, a seething, spreading infection, a live thing with a will that was taking over their bodies — and could be killing them...The city was frozen with fear, frozen into stillness. Starr lived 12 miles from the hospital. The streets were silent on his drive home, silent. They were so silent he took to counting the cars he saw. One night he saw no cars at all. He thought, “The life of the city had almost stopped.”
Everyone can read the collapse of official power in Philadelphia as supporting their politics. Anarchists can point to the benevolent spontaneous order that arose after the corrupt local government failed to act; libertarians can point out that this spontaneous order was all funded by the richest Philadelphians; statists can point out that, without actually-authoritative co-ordination, the effort eventually failed, because people defected against each other, in fear.
The corpses had backed up at undertakers’, filling every area of these establishments and pressing up into living quarters; in hospital morgues overflowing into corridors; in the city morgue overflowing into the street. And they had backed up in homes. They lay on porches, in closets, in corners of the floor, on beds. Children would sneak away from adults to stare at them, to touch them; a wife would lie next to a dead husband, unwilling to move him or leave him. The corpses, reminders of death and bringers of terror or grief, lay under ice at Indian-summer temperatures. Their presence was constant, a horror demoralizing the city; a horror that could not be escaped. Finally the city tried to catch up to them.The police wore their ghostly surgical masks, and people fled them, but the masks had no effect on the viruses and by mid-October thirty-three policemen had died, with many more to follow... More coffins came by rail, guarded by men with guns.
""There is, therefore, but one response possible from us: Force! force to the utmost, force without stint or limit, the righteous and triumphant force which shall make right the law of the world and cast every selfish dominion down in the dust. ""- Woodrow Wilson addressing one of his money-lending mobs.Wilson tends to be viewed pretty positively, just because he won. (""at last the world knows America as the savior of the world!"") But he perverted an entire state and nation to do so, ignored the terrible suffering of his own damn population for years, and refused a conditional peace with Austria in August and with the Kaiser's new parliament in September. (This meant 30-70 extra days of war, which, if this period was as lethal as the rest of the war, means up to 800,000 completely unnecessary deaths, not to mention the continuing waste of resources during the worst epidemic ever). Wilson did great evil, was not much different from the Kaiser, the election aside.
 the military suctioned more and more nurses and physicians into cantonments, aboard ships, into France, until it had extracted nearly all the best young physicians. Medical care for civilians deteriorated rapidly. The doctors who remained in civilian life were largely either incompetent young ones or those over forty-five years of age, the vast majority of whom had been trained in the old ways of medicine. 
Barry's middle chapters are a frightening portrait of how rabidly un-American the US was in 1918. The laws were bad enough - for instance the ban on criticising the government. But then there's the unofficial ""patriotic duties"", punishable by beatings. State-sponsored atavism.
By the summer of 1918, however, Wilson had injected the government into every facet of national life and had created great bureaucratic engines to focus all the nation’s attention and intent on the war.He had created a Food Administration to control and distribute food, a Fuel Administration to ration coal and gasoline, a War Industries Board to oversee the entire economy. He had taken all but physical control over the railroads and had created a federally sponsored river barge line that brought commerce back to life on the Mississippi River, a commerce that had been killed by competition from those railroads. He had built many dozens of military installations, each of which held at least tens of thousands of soldiers or sailors. He had created industries that made America’s shipyards teem with hundreds of thousands of laborers launching hundreds of ships, dug new coal mines to produce coal for the factories that weaned America’s military from British and French weapons and munitions—for, unlike in World War II, America was no arsenal of democracy.He had created a vast propaganda machine, an internal spy network, a bond-selling apparatus... He had even succeeded in stifling speech, in the summer of 1918 arresting and imprisoning — some for prison terms longer than ten years —not just radical labor leaders and editors of German-language newspapers but powerful men, even a congressman.He had injected the government into American life in ways unlike any other in the nation’s history. And the final extension of federal power had come only in the spring of 1918, after the first wave of influenza had begun jumping from camp to camp, when the government expanded the draft from males between the ages of twenty-one and thirty to those between the ages of eighteen and forty-five. Only on May 23, 1918, had Provost Marshal Enoch Crowder, who oversaw the draft, issued his “work or fight” order, stating that anyone not employed in an essential industry would be drafted...Crowder bragged about doing “in a day what the Prussian autocracy had been spending nearly fifty years to perfect...""In mid-August, as the lethal wave of the epidemic was gathering itself, Austria had already inquired about peace terms, an inquiry that Wilson rebuffed utterly. And as the epidemic was gathering full momentum, peace was only weeks away. Bulgaria had signed an armistice on September 29. On September 30, Kaiser Wilhelm had granted parliamentary government to the German nation; that same day Ludendorff had warned his government that Germany must extend peace feelers or disaster—immediate disaster—would follow. German diplomats sent out those feelers. Wilson ignored them. The Central Powers, Germany and her allies, were simultaneously breaking off one from one another and disintegrating internally as well. In the first week of October, Austria and Germany separately sent peace feelers to the Allies, and on October 7, Austria delivered a diplomatic note to Wilson formally seeking peace on any terms Wilson chose. Ten days later — days of battle and deaths — the Austrian note remained unanswered.Earlier Wilson had spoken of a “peace without victory,” believing only such a peace could last. But now he gave no indication that the war would soon be over. Although a rumor that the war had ended sent thrills through the nation, Wilson quickly renounced it. Nor would he relent. He was not now fighting to the death; he was fighting only to kill...If Wilson and his government would not be turned from his end even by the prospect of peace, they would hardly be turned by a virus. And the reluctance, inability, or outright refusal of the American government to shift targets would contribute to the killing. Wilson took no public note of the disease, and the thrust of the government was not diverted. The relief effort for influenza victims would find no assistance in the Food Administration or the Fuel Administration or the Railroad Administration. From neither the White House nor any other senior administration post would there come any leadership, any attempt to set priorities, any attempt to coordinate activities, any attempt to deliver resources....the military would give no help to civilians. Instead it would draw further upon civilian resources. The same day that Welch had stepped out of the autopsy room at Devens and called Gorgas’s office, his warning had been relayed to the army chief of staff, urging that all transfers be frozen unless absolutely necessary and that under no circumstances transfers from infected camps be made... Gorgas’s superiors ignored the warning. There was no interruption of movement between camps whatsoever; not until weeks later, with the camps paralyzed and, literally, tens of thousands of soldiers dead or dying, did the army make any adjustments.
Because the disease was everywhere, ravaging the entire species (and beyond), the book can't cover everything. Very little is said about non-Americans, i.e about 98% of the death and chaos. This is partly because there just isn't a lot of evidence about them, despite their influenza immunity and medical care being even worse. (This is why the top estimates reach 100m deaths, three times the median estimate.) Here is a passage about just a tiny number of them, in the north:
In Alaska, whites protected themselves. Sentries guarded all trails, and every person entering the city was quarantined for five days. Eskimos had no such luck. A senior Red Cross official warned that without “immediate medical assistance the race” could become “extinct.”...The navy provided the collier USS Brutus to carry a relief expedition... They found terrible things. One doctor visited ten tiny villages and found “three wiped out entirely; others average 85% deaths… Survivors generally children… probably 25% frozen to death before help arrived.”The virus probably did not kill all of them directly. But it struck so suddenly it left no one well enough to care for any others, no one to get food, no one to get water. And those who could have survived, surrounded by bodies, bodies of people they loved, might well have preferred to go where their family had gone, might well have wanted to no longer be alone... Two hundred sixty-six people had lived in Okak, and many dogs, dogs nearly wild. When the virus came, it struck so hard so fast people could not care for themselves or feed the dogs. The dogs grew hungry, crazed with hunger, devoured each other, then wildly smashed through windows and doors, and fed... In all of Labrador, at least one-third the total population died. 
---Barry commits at least one big error: he's horrified by the medical schools of the time having ""no standards for admission"":
 In research and education especially, American medicine lagged far behind [European medicine]... At least one hundred US medical schools would accept any man willing to pay tuition... and only a single medical school required its student to have a college degree... the Johns Hopkins itself, not student fees, paid [its] faculty salaries, and it required medical students to have not only a college degree but fluency in French and German and a background of science courses. 
But his enthusiasm for Johns Hopkins introducing the college degree requirement is misplaced. Contemporary US doctors (who all have 3 years of pre-med, or even more college, before they start medical training) are probably no better clinicians than undergraduate doctors in other countries, and are far further in debt. This requirement is probably one reason the American system is so fucked.I suppose Barry is just confusing the open admissions situation with the schools' appallingly low graduation standards, which is certainly one reason eC20th medicine sucked. (Many doctors had never looked down a microscope, never used a stethoscope on a patient, never seen a dissection.)---PS: Mostly unimportant corrections by a virologist here. Reply to these from Barry here."
54,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22063432-tom-mathews,5,"The old adage that 'those who fail to learn from the past are condemned to repeat it' has never been so true. President George W. Bush read this book shortly after it was published and was so impressed by the threat of future pandemics that he commissioned a department whose sole function was to prepare for future pandemics. This involved cooperation by federal, state and international entities (such as the WHO) to set up surveillance networks for potentially deadly diseases and to stockpile drugs and equipment such as mechanical ventilators that could be used in the event of a sharp spike in the number of inpatient hospitalizations. Unfortunately, the current president quickly defunded and essentially disbanded all of President Bush's efforts to prepare for what scientists and even foresighted politicians knew was inevitable. In his book, Barry wrote of the things that people did to protect themselves in 1918-19 and recommendations for what we could do when the next pandemic occurred. There was actually very few differences between the two lists: masks, hand-washing, social distancing and the cancelling of large gatherings being prominent on both lists. Barry asserted that our greatest chance of preventing a full-scale calamity lay in forethought and preparation. We will never know if that would have had much of an impact. When Barry wrote this book he likely couldn't have foreseen the political situation the U.S. finds itself in today but he knew politicians. He knew that in order to avoid boosting the enemy's morale in wartime, our leaders refused to speak honestly about the seriousness of the influenza pandemic and, as a result, millions died. But if he thought that politicians today were any better, he likely wouldn't have written in the afterward of one edition ""On a larger scale, and far more difficult, will be getting governments to tell the truth about the disease. This is perhaps the biggest lesson about 1918 and it is a lesson not yet learned.""I try to avoid revealing spoilers in my reviews but these are unusual times and I think that the best way to close this review is to let Barry do it for me. Here are the closing paragraphs in this magnificent work:
So the final lesson of 1918, a simple one yet one most difficult to execute, is that those who occupy positions of authority must lessen the panic that can alienate all within a society. Society cannot function if it is every man for himself. By definition, civilization cannot survive that. Those in authority must retain the public’s trust. The way to do that is to distort nothing, to put the best face on nothing, to try to manipulate no one. Lincoln said that first, and best. A leader must make whatever horror exists concrete. Only then will people be able to break it apart.

56,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4739424-mal-warwick,5,"A century ago a pandemic disease far more lethal than COVID-19 killed an estimated fifty to one hundred million people around the world—as many as one out of every twenty people then alive. The 1918 flu epidemic erupted during a war that had already killed tens of millions and at a time when medical science was far less accomplished than it is today. Although there are lessons to learn for our response to COVID-19, it’s important to view what happened then in its historical context. And that’s the approach John M. Barry so brilliantly takes in The Great Influenza. This engrossing book may well be one of the very best ever written on medical history.The historical context of the 1918 flu epidemicAs Barry makes clear, medical science had taken big steps forward in the decades before the pandemic erupted, especially in the United States. Half a century earlier, German researchers, and French to a lesser extent, led the world in medical research. However, by the outbreak of World War I, two institutions had spearheaded immense advances in American medicine: Johns Hopkins Hospital and the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research (later Rockefeller University).Johns Hopkins Hospital, founded in 1889, had been established expressly to bring the scientific method into the teaching and practice of medicine in the United States. The Rockefeller Institute set out from day one to become the world’s most important medical research institution, and many observers have expressed the opinion that it succeeded very shortly after its establishment in 1901. Barry traces the evolution of both Johns Hopkins and the Rockefeller (as they were then known) through in-depth sketches of the prominent physicians who led them. Those doctors, the heroes of the tale, played leadership roles in combating the 1918 flu epidemic, advising the military and government at all levels on precautionary measures and researching the origins of the disease and possible treatment. Unfortunately, they made little headway in either respect.Why the disease spread so widely and so quicklyThe doctors’ increasingly strident insistence on warning the public about the epidemic were met with rigid resistance until hundreds of thousands of Americans had already died. The Wilson administration had instituted draconian measures to prevent any news from reaching the public that would turn its attention from the need to support the war effort. Although press censorship was not in force, the nation’s press almost uniformly self-censored, parroting the official line that the disease was not serious while bodies piled up in the morgues. The result then, as it is today in the COVID-19 pandemic, was that those who denied the problem lost the public’s trust. But the biggest reason the influenza spread so widely and so quickly was the insistence of the US Army on transferring troops in large numbers from one base to another in crowded trains and then overseas in crowded ships.The 1918 flu epidemic was “the deadliest pandemic in history”Although up to five percent of the world’s population—and “as many as 8 to 10 percent of all young adults then living—died from the so-called “Spanish influenza,” its impact was not limited to the appalling death toll. Naturally, the pandemic greatly influenced the course of medical research and the adoption of public health measures far more widely than had been the case. But its consequences were far-reaching both in the conduct of World War I and in the shape of the peace that emerged from the conflict. Barry skillfully explores both themes in The Great Influenza.How the epidemic helped defeat GermanyIn April 1918, German commander Erich Ludendorff began “his last great offensive—Germany’s last real chance to win the war. The . . . offensive made great initial gains.” But then it stalled. Barry quotes the diary of a US Army surgeon stationed near the front: “‘The expected third phase of the great German offensive gets put off from day to day . . . I gather that the epidemic of grippe which hit us rather hard in Flanders also hit the Boche worse, and this may have caused the delay.'” In fact, Ludendorff himself “blamed influenza for the loss of initiative and the ultimate failure of the offensive.” No single battle necessarily changes the course of any war (although Midway, Stalingrad, and the Normandy Invasion are all claimed to have done just that in the next war.) But contemporary observers in 1918, and military analysts now, seem to agree that however slim the likelihood that Germany might end up victorious was certainly then lost.How the 1918 flu epidemic helped cause World War IIHistorians agree that the Treaty of Versailles that brought World War I to a close was a disaster. The excessive pain it imposed on Germany is almost universally acknowledged to have led in virtually a straight line to the Second World War. Yet that treaty took the form it did only because, midway through the peace conference, the world’s most popular statesman, Woodrow Wilson, suddenly and unaccountably “abandoned principles he had previously insisted upon. He yielded to [French Prime Minister Georges] Clemenceau everything of significance Clemenceau wanted, virtually all of which Wilson had earlier opposed.” Clemenceau was the primary architect of the harsh provisions incorporated into the treaty.Most accounts of Wilson’s strange turnabout at Versailles ascribe it to a minor stroke he suffered. The President was, in fact, in his sickbed when he made the fateful decision. However, Barry cites powerful evidence that Wilson had not in fact suffered a stroke. He had the flu. “Wilson’s actual symptoms—including high fever, severe coughing, and total prostration, [were] all symptoms that perfectly fit influenza and have no association whatsoever with stroke . . . Indeed, the virus may have contributed to the [severe] stroke” Wilson suffered much later that incapacitated him and led to his death.Where the “Spanish flu” really originatedWithin months of its appearance in the United States, the 1918 flu epidemic quickly went pandemic throughout Western Europe. The “Great War” was in its final months at the time, and rigid press censorship was in force on both sides of the trenches. Thus, even though thousands of American, French, British, and German troops were falling ill throughout the war zone, no news about their plight reached the home front in any one of the combatant countries. Neutral Spain, however, was different. There, alarmist reports about the virulence of the fast-spreading disease were splashed all over front pages. And that was how the epidemic came to be dubbed the “Spanish flu.”In fact, as Barry reports in detail, the deadly strain of H1N1 influenza at the heart of the 1918 flu epidemic almost certainly originated in Haskell County, Kansas, early that year. From there, the disease made its way eastward to a huge army “cantonment” where tens of thousands of troops were preparing to be shipped to France as cannon fodder for “Black Jack” Pershing‘s push against the German lines. Tens of thousands never made it there, falling victim instead to the flu. And, in carrying the disease to Europe, they triggered its spread to both Allied and enemy troops as well as civilian populations throughout Western Europe and ultimately to the rest of the world.How the 1918 flu epidemic was different from COVID-19In two major respects, the pandemic of a century ago differed significantly from what we are experiencing as I write:** Influenza is a respiratory disease that primarily attacks the lungs, nose, and throat. When it kills, it does so primarily through pneumonia. Although COVID-19 was initially feared to be similar in its effects, it is in truth a vascular disease that manifests through the circulatory system. ** It’s difficult for scientists to calculate the mortality (death) rate of a disease. But it is clear that the H1N1 influenza virus that emerged in 1918 was far more lethal than the COVID-19 strains that have been seen to date. Hundreds of thousands are dying today. Eventually, it seems likely that globally millions will do so. But it seems highly unlikely that the death toll will rise into the tens of millions as was the case a century ago.However, there is one significant way in which the two pandemics are similar. History tends to refer to the earlier pandemic as the “1918 flu epidemic,” suggesting that a first, relatively mild strain broke out in the spring of that year, followed by a second, far more lethal strain in the fall. In fact, though, the second wave lasted until 1919—and there was a third wave in 1920. Medical researchers tell us that COVID-19 is almost certain to behave in a similar fashion. As I write, we are experiencing either the first or the second wave of the disease (the experts differ). Yet another outbreak seems certain, with or without the speedy development of a vaccine—polyannish predictions to the contrary notwithstanding."

Outside of these few very well-known accounts, there is almost nothing in literature about it afterwards. They write about horrors that people inflict on people. Apparently they forget the horrors that nature inflicts on people, the horrors that make humans least significant. And yet the pandemic resonated.” Times like these only help us get perspective, Human race suffers from Amnesia and keeps forgetting the one and biggest truth of all. As Nietzsche's said - ""In some remote corner of the universe, poured out and glittering in innumerable solar systems, there once was a star on which clever animals invented knowledge. That was the highest and most mendacious minute of ""world history""—yet only a minute. After nature had drawn a few breaths the star grew cold, and the clever animals had to die."" We are nothing but a speck of dust in the grand scheme of things and times like these keep reminding us that. But times likes also explain why we are most thriving species on the earth today. We have invented these abstract concepts of ""Love"" , ""Compassion"" and ""Hope"" and that's what defines us. At the end this will be over I hope we are able to learn something out of this. This is an amazing read in my mind. The book not just telling the story of the pandemic but the foundations of the medical science in America. The author has done an amazing job covering different aspect of those times and I can certainly draw similarities in the current ongoing situations. It has definitely given me perspective.

The early history of the practice medicine in this country and lack of training of the doctors was jaw dropping.

I keep seeing this book mentioned in the news (today: https://www.deseret.com/utah/2020/8/9...) so maybe I need to dust it off and give it another try. We'll see...2/28/18 REVIEW: Sigh, giving up on this book and marking it DNF. It's bloated and repetitive and verbose and wordy and ... umm, did I mention it's repetitive? I don't know if it's poorly-written or poorly-edited, but there were places were the same thing was said within pages of each other. And boring?!? Honestly, I was looking for a book about the flu to read during flu-season (especially in the year I decided NOT to get the flu shot), and all we get is lengthy biographies about the doctors and people who... well, I'm not even sure how most of them are important to the story. Really, when you pick up a book about a deadly disease you want to read about the deadly disease, and not wait for a couple hundred pages for it to appear or get good. The book is going back on the shelf but I guess I'll leave my bookmark where it is, just in case I get really bored."

Before I get talk about the book itself, I’d like to say a few words about the peril of popular historical analogy. Really, this current Corona virus and the 1918 flu are not equivalent. Different diseases different times different responses. For starters, 1918 was a war economy. If people had chirped about lack of toilet paper or individual rights to be out and about, they would have been swiftly muzzled. Second, the government involvement at the federal level was vastly different. In 1918 the federal government did absolutely nothing, tot even brave words of comfort, for civilians suffers the flu. Today the government is throwing massive amounts of money at the problem even if it is at the behest of business special interests. At least the government is trying something. In fact, the only thing similar is that local governments are bearing the brunt of the response and that said response is a patchwork and that the media is following local government lead, in 1918 largely silent about the danger, in 2020 loudly proclaiming from the rooftops about the dangers. The last difference is the most important, different diseases. The 1918 flu struck quickly with a 48 to 72-hour incubation period and often killed suddenly as short as 12 hours after symptoms largely because the body’s immune system had to mount such a vigorous defense that if killed the body in the process. This corona virus is a two-week incubation period and seems to be more of a slow and more predictable killer.  Hopefully you’re still reading at this point as I will now discuss the book. I like books on pandemics when I can find them. They’re interesting and often draw lessons, usually for apocalypse writers, but unfortunately, real life currently. I chose this book because it’s the popular definitive work on the 1918 flu and that’s where the book falls short. The The organization of this book is just bad. It’s a confusing narrative structure with no real timeline and constant doubling back and forth interspersed with chapters on diseases and the like. It’s extremely repetitive. The writing is uneven. Sometimes it slows admirably and at other times gets bogged down in statistics and detail. The book also becomes awfully dry at times, particularly when discussing diseases themselves in quite detailed fashion. The content is also uneven. There’s lots here which isn’t truly relevant like medical school history and the life stories of doctors whose insolvent with the flu was more administrate than actual work. In short, this book was just a mess and clearly there was no good editing done on it. This book could have been a lot better than it was. So, I give this a 3. It’s interesting and at times, quite readable and even compelling. But, it’s dismally organized and edited. It could have been much better. "
61,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12087691-wendyb,5," A must-read book for the times we live in.Starts out with maybe just a little too much background on some of the doctors involved in the 1918 flu research but still interesting info on the state of medicine at that time.Got really interesting with the info on the start of the flu and the effect on the population.In researching my family background, I discovered my grandparents' first child died in Oct 1918 of the Spanish Flu at just 12 days old. So in some small ways, this history still touches us today."
62,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5364077-connie-g,4,"The great influenza pandemic of 1918-1920 killed between 20 to 100 million people worldwide, more fatalities than any other pandemic in history. Unlike most influenza, this one targeted young people in their 20s and 30s. Although it's called the Spanish flu because the Spanish press had extensive coverage of the disease, it's thought to have originated in Kansas. Soldiers carried the disease as they traveled between crowded military facilities, then crossed the Atlantic on crowded boats to fight in World War I.Author John M. Barry also writes about the advances in medical education and medical research in the United States which occurred just before the pandemic. The Johns Hopkins Medical School and the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research were highlighted. He goes into great detail describing the lives and work of the medical researchers. While the pandemic was raging, researchers were not able to identify the viral pathogen, and many thought that the bacteria causing secondary infections was responsible. The book contains excellent descriptions of how a virus attacks human cells and replicates in the body. The mutation of viruses and the development of vaccines are also discussed.Barry also writes about the way politics and misinformation from public officials exacerbated the pandemic of 1918. Although the book was written in 2004, it has warnings that are important today during the COVID crisis. This timely book is interesting and well researched, although some readers may find there is too much detail about the medical schools and researchers."
63,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2190636-joselito-honestly-and-brilliantly,5,"The 1918 Flu Pandemic coincided with the First World War and it killed more than both the military and civilian casualties of the conflict yet while the war generated an avalanche of literature (poems, songs, music, fiction, films, biographies and autobiographies) not much serious work had been done about this pandemic until this book published in 2004.I read this a few years back and I’ve disposed of my copy already but since it was a gripping, unforgettable read, I could still recall some tidbits of information about this 1918 pandemic in relation with what we are now experiencing during the present one.First of all, and this is what is often found to be the most surprising about whatever virus was it which caused the 1918 pandemic, the most vulnerable was those who were physically fit and at the prime of their lives (think those in their 20’s or 30’s who eat healthy and go to the gym). Contrast this with with most of the present Covid 19 fatalities who are old and who had pre-existing health issues. But why is that? For some reasons, the body’s immune system or antibodies react to the 1918 virus in a weird way. They overreact or overdo things. The analogy is that when a fly (the virus) enters a house (the human body) someone drops an atom bomb (the antibodies) on it to kill the fly and because of it even the house is completely destroyed. So that is why it was the healthy and the strong who mostly died: they were the ones with stronger antibodies.Secondly, the incubation period for the 1918 virus was apparently shorter. I think there was a story in the book about someone talking gaily on a street, apparently healthy, then in just an hour or so would die there in that same place. Or a bus of healthy-looking people stopping before it reaches its destination because its driver (with 6 of its passengers) dropping dead.The 1918 pandemic killed about 100 Million people worldwide. No one knew how it was stopped. Probably it just got tired of killing people."

The book is very dry to read. The writing is repetitive and it drags on and on. Part 1 is the development of American medical science (public health study, John Hopkins Medical School etc...). Part 2 is mostly US politics (Woodrow Wilson, WWI and how wartime censorship was implemented). The rest is about the pandemic. The book should be better titled as ""The Great Influenza and How the US Dealt With It"", because it covers only a little outside the United States.At least 50m people (5% world population) had been wiped out by the pandemic, which is equivalent to 390m people today. There were three waves in the pandemic, the second wave the worst. In US, the condition in East Coast was worse than the west coast. San Francisco managed relatively well among big cities in US. Scientists did not find out the pathogen until many years later. The genome of the virus was sequenced in 2005.What strikes me most is that how the US politics today regarding Covid-19 has much in common with what happened in the 1918-1919 pandemic.

68,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35645863-lena,5,"Beyond five stars. How many books are entertaining, important, engaging and edifying? I can only think of one, this one.  I thought this was going to read like a thriller by Michael Crichton or Dan Brown following a plucky single doctor who fights hard for his patients, makes a breakthrough, and saves the day. That's not this book because that's definitely not what happened. The book starts off with a history of medicine. I had a vague idea about this beginning with Hypocrites and then jumping to those bleeders in Period dramas that announce, ""He's not long for this world."" with much in between. But there wasn't much in between and that's the problem.    While the other sciences moved in leaps and bounds medicine did not. There were lightbulbs and trains and the doctor was still coming to bleed you. Barry gives two reasons for this stagnation. The first is the anathema of autopsy. For the longest time it was simply unthinkable to cut into and examine a human being, it was too close to butchers work. Then there was a religious stigma attached but even in the twentieth century the liberal gods spoke out against it. Hell, even today hardened cops don't like attending autopsies.The second reason is a little trickier to understand - medicine is not logical like the other sciences. Barry gives an excellent example. A doctor in the early 1900s noticed that the face flushed during fever so he reasoned that fever could be a capillary issue. To test his theory he bled his fever patients. They went pale, their temperature dropped, and they were ravenous for food and drink. A cure! He published his finding, which was easily replicated, and was much lauded by the medical community. It was perfectly logical. It was wrong. Due to this reputation for butchery, witchery, and general ineffectiveness, being a doctor was not a respected profession. Medical schools were shockingly bad pass/fail systems where teacher salaries were based on butts in seats. Things changed quickly when they changed and you'll have to read the book to find out. This was the first book I read in 2016 and here I sit on the last evening of the year trying to finish this review. It was not mere procrastination; I was daunted by how much I enjoyed, learned, and was affected by this book. I became a vegetarian for four months and switched out all my beauty products to the more expensive cruelty free lines. And that was not even the point of the book. This entire review and I haven't even mentioned the word flu. Sigh. Just read it. *special thanks to my 2015 Secret Santa Krystal!"
69,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1649751-florence,4,"This is a very frightening book. We usually consider the flu to be a non life threatening disease. Not true in 1918. The disease killed millions in a worldwide pandemic. The actual number of fatalities can never be known because medical systems were so overwhelmed that many people were dying at home without ever seeing a medical professional. The grisly details of how ordinary people suffered are in this comprehensive book. Also covered are scientific descriptions of bacteria and viruses that a reader without a scientific background can comprehend. The pandemic seemed to be a perfect storm. President Woodrow Wilson was myopically focused on victory overseas as the Great War raged on. He made a fateful decision to send ailing troops to Europe, disregarding the advice of military health experts, exponentially expanding the disease to Europe. It took over 20 years to identify the virus that causes influenza. Initially it is transferred from an animal and has the diabolic ability to rapidly mutate to a form that can be spread among humans. Can a pandemic of this scope occur again? Almost certainly."
70,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/241691-kay,3,"""One always tends to overpraise a long book because one has got through it."" – E.M. ForsterIt took me the better part of the summer to listen to this audiobook in my car (I don't drive that much) -- and I confess that it soon became more of a chore than a pleasure. I do wish there had been a competently edited abridged version, for if ever a book cried out for editing, it was this one. Some of the book's strengths, however, include the exhaustive account of how the pandemic started and spread, not to mention the effect it had on society. There was a huge amount of material on how the authorities (mostly didn't) deal with the crisis, one of the key themes of the book being that in order to deal with such a threat that the civil authorities need to be completely honest about it. Point taken, but it was repeated over and over and over.... as were the somewhat melodramatic accounts of how the bodies stacked up, what having the disease was like, what the death toll was, and so on and so forth. Another strength was the intimate portraits of key researchers who rushed to find the cause of -- and a vaccine for -- the particularly virulent strain of influenza. There was a problem, though, in that the book's entire first section was a somewhat tedious historical account of the Johns Hopkins Institute. I'm still not sure why that was necessary (and suspect it wasn't). Granted, it was good to know what the state of medicine was at the turn of the century, but such an overview certainly could have been done more concisely. I also had real issues with the way several medical researchers, and in particular Paul Lewis, were cast into ""roles"" -- with Lewis the tragic figure that the author claimed was ""the last victim"" of the pandemic. Humph!However, I did find it fascinating to read about the details and design of medical research, and in particular how viruses mutated and became more or less deadly. In fact, I wished for a bit more of that information and less of the endless parade of statistics that Barry seemed so inordinately fond of. I came to believe that he had never met a statistic he didn't like (or subsequently use). Again, I was puzzled about why the editors hadn't intervened and winnowed out the repetitious material. Scott Brick, the reader for this book, was one of the biggest irritants, however, and no doubt significantly contributed to my feeling that the book was NEVER going to end. While his voice wasn't an unpleasant one, he seemed to have a very narrow ""range"" of intonation and emphasis. In fact, it sounded like he was overemphasizing just about everything, and he had a particular way of lingering over and stressing the word ""any"" that made me want to shriek after the first few hours. I had a hard time separating my irritation with his reading from my general impatience with the book, which is probably the reason I gave this three stars rather than two -- I'm not entirely sure whose fault it was that I didn't find this as interesting as I'd expected. (Plus, as Forster noted, one DOES tend to overpraise a long book that one finally manages to finish.) If I'd been reading this book rather than listening to it, undoubtedly I would have been able to skim pretty efficiently, slowing down for the parts that interested me the most and just skipping over the repetitive bits. But as a ""captive"" listener, it was pretty tough going. "
71,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/541670-caroline,2,"I had no less than four people come up to me while I was reading this book and tell me how great it was. Apparently it also made quite a splash at USAID when it was published. Maybe that's why three out of the four people who approached me were coworkers.It's possible these endorsements gave me unrealistic expectations, because by the time I finished it I was practically pulling my hair out. Which is a bummer because I was super excited to read The Great Influenza. I love books about medicine and medical history, so it wasn't the subject, it was what story author John Barry chose (tried?) to tell.An anecdote: Occasionally in high school, I would hit a particularly difficult calculus problem and seek out my mechanical engineer father for help. I'd show him the problem, perhaps a particularly pernicious related rate problem. Instead of starting from the problem itself, my dad always wanted to make sure I understood all of the individual concepts required to complete it. The running joke is that if I came to him with a calculus problem, he'd start no later in the material than the formal definition of a derivative and go from there. It would take several chapters worth of content before we arrived at the actual matter at hand. I still enjoy ribbing my dad about his approach to calculus assistance. He's sitting across the room from me right now and when I told him what I was writing he just grinned and declared ""First principles! You must build block by block on first principles!"" Hello, Dad who I've exaggerated for comedic effect, meet John M. Barry.John Barry started this book with Hippocrates and Galen. He then spent 166 pages getting from ancient Greece to the scientific revolution in American medicine that occurred in the early 20th century. He provides painstaking detail surrounding the creation of Johns Hopkins University (to be fair, this was pretty interesting, it's just... not the 1918 influenza pandemic). He introduces a small army of doctors, bacteriologists, and medical researchers, all of whom played a role in dragging medicine into the 20th century via the scientific method.Then, we have a mighty record scratch and Barry decides to spend about 200 pages on the 1918 epidemic itself. The majority of individuals introduced in the first section of the book take a backseat to an almost mind-numbing number of U.S. military cantonments, local and national politicians, and morbidity and mortality statistics. The level of detail is overwhelming and largely made my eyes glaze over. Frustratingly, this part of the book felt almost entirely disconnected from the medical history discussed earlier. Due to the severity of the pandemic, the carefully laboratory work according to the scientific method had to be discarded for shortcuts and best guesses. I figured Barry would highlight this irony and while he mentioned it a time or two, he for the most part just kept barreling forward through the history.Record scratch number two. With the end of the pandemic, we return to a smaller subset of the cast of characters discussed prior to its arrival and follow their lives and research down a number of paths that are only tangentially related (if at all) to influenza. Many of the most important individuals from the first part of the book are discarded without providing any sort of conclusion to their story.The whole thing was immensely aggravating. Whenever I look at a marble sculptures in art museums, I marvel at the fact that a sculptor was able to look at a block of stone, see the figure within, and get rid of the extra to reveal what was there all along. The Great Influenza felt like John M. Barry looking at a block of marble, seeing David, sculpting away, and instead revealing a figure with six arms, two heads, and feet erupting Alien-like from its chest. There are probably two and a half good books contained within, but Barry couldn't see what to get rid of and editor Wendy Wolf certainly didn't take a firm enough hand. I'm genuinely alarmed at the thought of what this book looked like pre-editor after reading the bloated and muddled final result. Here's the kicker: in the acknowledgements, John Barry pulls back the curtain on the process of writing the book and fully reveals his obliviousness. Get a load of this:""This book was initially supposed to be a straightforward story of the deadliest epidemic in human history, told from the perspectives of both scientists who tried to fight it and political leaders who tried to respond to it. I though it would take me two and a half years to write, three at the most. That plan didn't work. Instead this book took seven years to write. It has evolved (and, I hope, grown) into something rather different than originally conceived.""NO JOHN, THE NEW PLAN PLAN DIDN'T WORK. YOU SHOULD HAVE STUCK WITH THE ORIGINAL. Seven years. Holy crud.Other nits to pick: I often felt like Barry had an agenda to push. At various times in the book, he would stake out rather extreme positions and seemed to only approach the history from that angle, with Wilson's approach to World War I and the U.S. military's approach to the pandemic being two of the major examples. Were either perfect? Certainly not, but Barry seemed almost to cast them as the villains of the influenza pandemic, a practice I found unhelpful. I was also distinctly uncomfortable with an insinuation Barry made about the death of Paul A. Lewis. Implying suicide shouldn't be thrown around without evidence, and Barry provided nothing concrete. Not cool, dude.The writing is also nothing to write home about. Barry has an annoying habit of repeating anecdotes throughout the book and if I see the sentence ""It was influenza, only influenza"" one more time, I might scream.It's probably 1.5 stars but I'm rounding up. So why two instead of one? I did learn some things and a number of individual threads in the book were interesting. Highlights include a better understanding of why Johns Hopkins has the reputation it does, what the Hs and Ns are in influenza (ex: the H1N1 strain), and the word enzootic*.In all honesty, though, I'd probably pass on this one. You can learn the bulk of the 1918 influenza-specific stuff more quickly and enjoyably via Wikipedia. *It is to animals what the word ""epidemic"" is to humans, which makes sense given the roots. I'm distinctly less excited about it now, though, having just looked up the pronunciation and realized that it is pronounced en-zoh-AH-tic instead of en-ZOO-tic. I suppose you can't win them all."
72,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3244513-mike,4,"Overall this was a very good book. Expansive, thorough, and at times utterly fascinating. I'm sure people around me are completely sick of me talking about the flu at this point but this is that kind of book that will do that to you. It falls short of getting five stars for a couple of reasons, some of which are about the book but most of which are about me as a reader:1. It's almost too expansive: In Barry's quest to explore every possible nook and cranny of the 1918 Influenza pandemic he leaves no scientific idea or historical actor unearthed and thoroughly discussed. This lends to a skater shot feel to the book as you lurch from one person to another in chronological order with whole chapters about the science of viruses and bacteria popping up here and there to interrupt the forward momentum of the story. I feel like I got a about a dozen very short, somewhat shallow, biographies in this one book and a bit more science that I really wanted. 2. Lack of a supporting personal story or strong main character: When I contrast this book with Steven Johnson's ""Ghost Map"", which is all about John Snow and how he dealt with a cholera outbreak in London in the 19th Century, I find that it didn't hold my attention all the time because I didn't really connect with any of the people in the book or feel like there was a broad narrative that was pulling me along. Sure, he does a good job of showing how the pandemic began, how it peaks, and how it ebbs but the pandemic is far too amorphous for me to really relate to. And while he clearly shows how many of the people in the book react at these different phases I didn't really feel like I got to know any of them with the kind of detail that Johnson pulled out of John Snow.3. Hey, you got your science book in my history book! No, you got your history book in my science book! Wow, they're two great genres that kind of make for a confusing mess when you put them all together: Okay, this gripe is all about me as a reader. I'm WAY more interested in history and politics than science. Unless the science is about robots, zombies, or space ships at a certain point I kind of just zone out. Barry, at times, gets super deep on the science of influenza explaining in great detail how it infects the body and causes no end of problems. While it is a great feat of writing to talk about that sort of thing without losing the reader (to his credit it was never confusing) it doesn't make for a compelling read for me. When Barry talks about history in this book it's completely riveting, I literally couldn't put it down, but then there would be a speed bump science chapter and I'd have to slog through it to get back to the ideas that were the most interesting to me. It made for a frustrating read at times.Over all I would highly recommend this book. It really was quite good, my gripes aside. And, frankly, the historical implications of the book make it worth the read alone (namely that at a crucial junction in the negotiation of the Treaty of Versailles at the end of World War I Pres. Wilson came down with the flu and it, for a bunch of reasons, left him possibly permanently mentally impaired - he believed from that point on that French spies had infiltrated the White House for example - is shocking. Given that that treaty is often held directly responsible for the rise of Nazi Germany, and World War II, and that the principle features of that treaty may have caused the rise of the Nazi's were almost all pushed by the French and opposed by Pres. Wison, until his bought with the flu that is, one is left believing if not for the flu the world could have been very different). If you like science and enjoy history I think this would be a very satisfying reading experience.As an aside, I gave this book to my Grandmother for Christmas in 2009 when she was 91 years old. She and I developed a pattern late in her life of me giving her books that I'd read that I liked for birthdays and Christmas. She was an avid reader and game to read anything, although like me her preferences were more inclined to history, biography, and travel. This was one of the rare books I gave her without reading first. When I asked her, on Christmas 2011, to lend me one of her favorite books she gave me this one. She was born in April of 1918, near the beginning of this book, and I think for her the book explained a lot of things people would mention in her childhood that never made much sense (relatives who died during the flu, particular idioms people would use, or beliefs they had about sickness). She died in March of 2012 just a month shy of 94. In reading this book I am profoundly impressed by her intelligence. This book is not an easy read in spots (there were sections I read twice) and for someone who didn't even finish high school to read this book and not only understand it but enjoy it is a testament to the amazing person she was. This book still has the post-it note she always put on the inside front cover of books she got as gifts with the date, occasion, and person(s) who gave it to her. While she may be gone it makes me happy that she and I could at least share this one last experience together. "

Reading it in the time of Coronavirus is eye-opening. I wish that the shrill shrieking gerbils of the media would provide comparisons ""per population"" for their numbers, and also comparisons with the traditional flu. The 2nd half of the book is especially worthwhile in this time of pandemic.********I highly recommend this book! It reads like a ""who-done-it"", except that you know who did it (the influenza virus) and you are watching the medical scientists struggle to find solutions while the wild-fire of the 1918 influenza pandemic raged all around them. Will they find a solution in time? (see the bottom paragraph for an answer to this question)Before documenting the path of the 1918 influenza, the author lays the groundwork for the transformed medical atmosphere from the late 1800's into the early 1900's in America. This path thus shows the beginnings of the the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research, the Phipps Institute, and Johns Hopkins University. Names of medical pioneers and influenza warriors such as Paul Lewis (who proved that polio was caused by a virus in 1907 and developed a vaccine that was 100% effective in protecting monkeys), William Henry Welch (the single most powerful individual in the history of American medicine, who directed the rise of Johns Hopkins University, and who with John D. Rockefeller Jr. created the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research, arguablly the best scientific research institute in the world), Simon Flexner (first head of the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research, the man who brought the mortality rate for common bacterial meningitis down to 18% in 1919 WITHOUT antibiotics!), Rufus Cole (who made the Rockefeller Institute Hospital a model for the way clinical research is conducted), Army Surgeon General William Gorgas (whose work in abating the transmission of yellow fever and malaria by controlling the mosquitos saved hundreds of thousands of lives, and allowed construction on the Panama Canal), Oswald Avery (whose work on influenza would lead him to one of the most important scientific discoveries in the 20th century, that DNA is the material of which genes and chromosomes are made), Anna Wessel Williams (the leading female bacteriologist in the world who worked hand in hand with William Park trying to develop a serum or vaccine for influenza),William Park (teamed with Anna Wessel Williams, developed the diptheria antitoxin still in use today), andRichard Shope (who as the first to prove that a virus caused influenza) fill the pages of this book. After setting the stage with its influenza warriors and medical laboratories, the author then begins the saga of the influenza virus itself. Influenza struck in the first wave in the winter and spring of 1918, a mild ""three day fever"" form that most recovered from. The second wave hit in the fall of 1918. This wave was the most virulent and deadly. The third wave hit somewhere in the winter / spring of 1919, and was once again a less virulent form. In just 2 years the virus mutated into a super killer, then back into a more mild disease. In raw numbers, the lowest estimate of the worldwide death toll at the time was 20 million. Knowing what we know now, epidemiologists today estimate that influenza caused at least 50 million and possibly 100 million deaths worldwide. All that in a time when the population of the world was 1/3rd of what it is today. The terrifying aspect of the super killer influenza was that it did not strike the traditional victims... the old and the very young, but instead hit hardest in the age group of 20's and 30's. If the upper estimate of 100 million deaths is accurate, then 8 to 10 percent of all young adults then living were killed by the virus.And these deaths happened with blinding speed. The influenza pandemic stretched out over 2 years. But 2/3rds of the deaths occurred in a period of 24 weeks. That is about 66 million deaths in 24 weeks. Averaged out that would be 2.5 million deaths per week. Yet more than half of those 66 million deaths happened from mid-September to early December of 1918. That is really 33 million deaths in 10 to 12 weeks! That's 3.3 MILLION deaths PER WEEK in the late fall and early winter of 1918! And remember that the world population at the time was less than 1/3rd of what it is today (which is 6.8 billion people). The numbers are just staggering, and I had to keep reading them and figuring out the numbers and it still is a staggering thought. So many died in so short a time! Epidemiological evidence from the work of Dr. Loring Miner seems to show that the new influenza virus originated in Haskell County, Kansas early in the winter of 1918. Dr. Miner documented early cases of the new influenza that showed disturbing mortality rates in a very short period of time. The virus then went to a huge army base in the eastern part of the state as troops were gathered in preparation for their deployment to Europe for WWI. From that army base, soliders were sent to France, soldiers were transferred to other bases in the United States....and the disease began sweeping through North America, Europe, South America, Asia, Africa, and the entire world. Some situations requiring fast decision making in chaotic circumstances were carried out well. Other situations were not handled as well. The ins and outs of these crossing paths of decisions, deaths mounting rapidly, politics, mililtary directives, and newly formed medical laboratories make up the rest of the book. The story is staggering, but gripping. In answer to the question at the beginning of this review, the answer is ""no, the medical scientists did not find a solution during the time of the 1918 thru 1920 influenza pandemic"". They learned alot, yes. They also learned that the only way to be protected from the disease was through isolation from it. Medical practices helping and treating the ill were improved, but a vaccine was never been found. The only reason the killing influenza stopped killing was because it mutated away from the more virulent form into a milder form. So the question immediately to ask is ""what happens if the virus mutates back to the virulent form?"". And that is the question we are left with at the end of the book. In the concluding chapter, the author raises these issues and concludes tentatively that in pandemic times, an authorized power (government, World Health Organization, army, someone) must have the authority to act and to act quickly, and their decisions must trump individual freedoms. Mandatory vaccinations, mandatory quaranatine, mandatory travel restrictions are the things that must be done to protect the larger population. The ""needs of the many outweigh the needs of the one"", if I may quote a Star Trek movie. In times of such overwhelming medical need, quick decisions must be made and sometimes they must be harsh."

78,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10978428-jim,4,"The bodies were piling up. The undertakers, themselves falling sick, were overwhelmed. There was no place to put the bodies. Gravediggers were either sick or refused to bury the influenza victims. Caskets were stacking up...then they ran short of caskets. The city morgue filled up. The stench was terrible...this was Philadelphia, October 1918, the time of the so-called ""Spanish flu."" Barry gives us a panoramic view of the most lethal influenza outbreak in history which occurred in 1918-1919. Today we believe that the death toll in the United States was 675,000 out of a population of 105 million. As many as 100 million died worldwide out of a global population of 1.8 billion, more than 5% of the world's population.  Barry follows the movement of the flu virus across the world, starting in rural Kansas, where somehow the virus crossed the animal-human barrier (from chickens?). It erupted in an Army camp in Kansas and moved east with the soldiers and then went on the troopships with them to Europe...It came in three waves, that first wave that hit the soldiers in the spring of 1918 was rather mild. But then in the fall, there was the second wave that was much more virulent--that's when most of the deaths occurred. Then the virus mutated again and there was a third wave which hit places like Australia--which had not been hit so hard by the second wave. Much of the book is involved with the story of the scientists battling the virus. Barry goes into some detail about this and focuses on some key figures. As he explains, a revolution had occurred in American medicine where labs had been organized and work was going on with the expectation that disease could be conquered by modern science. When it came to the great influenza, science failed. We are still living with the consequences of that.  The book was published in 2004 and, in it, Barry warns that we will face another pandemic. It's only a question of when. He states that we are NOT prepared for a pandemic. The events of this year of 2020 shows that he was right."
79,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6949571-thomas-paul,5,"It killed more people in 6 months than the Black Death killed in a century. People who were young and strong were the most likely to die. In the US, 650,000 people died. The average life expectancy in the US went down by 10 years. Worldwide, perhaps 100 million people died. And yet, it was only the flu. Even today, 90 years after the epidemic, it kills 36,000 Americans in a typical year and we are hardly more prepared to face another epidemic.John M. Barry has written a fascinating account of the influenza epidemic of 1918. But the book is a lot more than just a review of the flu. Barry starts out by examining the state of the American health system at the time of the epidemic and how it reached that state. He explores the revolutionary changes to medicine that occurred in the late 19th and early 20th century and the people who led those changes. He shows us why, even today, a cure for influenza is beyond our reach, explaining in layman’s terms how the influenza virus changes to become deadly and changes again to lose that deadliness. He explains how an endemic virus can lead to an epidemic of unimagined proportions.Barry also shows how the demands of World War I on troop movements, the propaganda campaigns to keep morale high, and the failure of leaders to listen to the doctors and researchers led to a killing field of historic size. His account tends to concentrate on Philadelphia because the city was hit extremely hard and much of the research going on was near that city but he does cover other areas around the world hit hard by the virus, although his coverage of the flu outside of the US is sketchy at best. He gives us writings from diaries and newspaper articles to show what was actually happening and how the media tried to downplay the epidemic. He gives us detailed accounts of the research (and the researchers) that was done to fight the epidemic, explains why this research was mostly unsuccessful, and does it all in a way that is easy to understand even if you don’t have a medical degree.Barry likes to use foreshadowing, hints of what is to come, to keep the reader’s interest and it does work, even if it is a bit melodramatic. Even the chapter titles, “The Tinderbox”, “It Begins”, The Race”, provide some melodrama to the story. The book mostly moves at a good pace and I found myself having trouble putting it down. Barry has written a book that everyone should read, whether you are familiar with the epidemic or not. It is a fascinating, terrifying, detailed, and extremely important book."
80,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8298053-colleen-browne,3,"This book starts out with a summary of medicine from Hippocrates to the First World War. That seems like it would be a long slog but because there was so little advancement during that time, it is done fairly quickly. As a reader with very limited knowledge of the history of medicine, I found this very interesting. What I didn't know at the beginning of the book was that the better part of the book was spent with the author going off on tangents only peripherally related to the pandemic. There is a great deal of information in this book, too much information. This book could have done with a good editor. The length of the book was about the same length as most of the books I read, and in many cases, much shorter but it didn't feel that way. It felt much longer. Barry's use of metaphor was helpful in explaining his subject and his style of writing wasn't awful as many reviewers have charged but he didn't seem to know when to stop on those threads that he followed out to what felt like oblivion at times. This is the first book I have read devoted to the subject (and may be the last). I could not recommend this book; at least not to anyone just interested in the pandemic. I can only suppose that there are better books on the topic."

83,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68316850-gavin,3,"Rousing history of one of the worst things that has ever happened: the 1918 outbreak of H1N1 flu. It focusses particularly on the great scientists who tried to fight it, none of whom I'd ever heard of. Also a meditation on epistemology, the modern mind, & the redemptive meaning of science for beasts like us.Barry senses that the headline result - one-third of the entire world infected, with 
25-100
 million dead - doesn't get enough of a rise from us. The numbers are numbing. So he couches it in modern shocking terms:
 It killed more people in twenty-four weeks than AIDS has killed in twenty-four years, more in a year than the Black Death killed in a century.
Or ten thousand 9/11s. It's worth belabouring this, because we have a weird habit of paying far more attention to human threats than natural ones, even when natural ones are far worse. (Witness our terrorism prevention budgets compared to our infectious disease control budgets, when the latter is a thousand times more lethal.)So: The 1918 flu was worse than the entire First World War: 40+ million died of flu compared with 17 million dead from war; 500 million lives damaged by flu vs 41 million lives by war. 3% of everyone alive died of flu, including about 8% of young adults(!).Except it's hard to separate the War and the pandemic. The virus was spread everywhere by unprecedented numbers of troops, and by the massive supply convoys it induced, and by the War's other human displacements. We don't know how many of the pneumonia deaths only occurred because of the logistical degradation, poverty and pestilence of wartime. There are terrible nonlinearities involved in overcrowding and global movement of troops. But add millions at least to the overall death toll caused by WWI.The book is in the epic mode, all the way through. (That's not a straightforward compliment.) I liked it, but I understand if it's a bit American for you:
Man might be defined as “modern” largely to the extent that he attempts to control nature. In this relationship with nature, modern humanity has generally been the aggressor, and a daring one at that, altering the flow of rivers, building upon geological faults, and, today, even engineering the genes of existing species. Nature has generally been languid in its response, although contentious once aroused and occasionally displaying a flair for violence.By 1918 humankind was fully modern, and fully scientific, but too busy fighting itself to aggress against nature. Nature, however, chooses its own moments. It chose this moment to aggress against man, and it did not do so prodding languidly. For the first time, modern humanity, a humanity practicing the modern scientific method, would confront nature in its fullest rage.
There's a long prelude describing how terrible medicine was up to the 20th Century. Medicine was ""the withered arm of science"". Therapeutic nihilism (that is, ""we can't really do anything"") was the only rational view, replacing millenia of Galenic woo.
Stengel reviewed dozens of ideas advanced in medical journals. Gargles of various disinfectants. Drugs. Immune sera. Typhoid vaccine. Diphtheria antitoxin. But Stengel’s message was simple: This doesn’t work. That doesn’t work. Nothing worked... Nothing they were doing worked.
Problem is, this rational scepticism created a powerful vacuum: humans need to believe something can heal, and the gap was filled with worse. Some confabulated gremlins from this time haunt us still: homeopathy, chiropractic, naturopathy, Christian Science, and (though Barry doesn't include them) the organic farming movement and psychoanalysis.Few people come off well. Even among the scientists, we get a horrible example of perverse priors and premature updating: an enormous proportion of all scientific resources were devoted to fighting the wrong pathogen, due to a bad guess by an extremely eminent researcher.Because so much of the state was occupied in war, in places there was wholesale social collapse:
In Philadelphia meanwhile fear came and stayed. Death could come from anyone, anytime. People moved away from others on the sidewalk, avoided conversation; if they did speak, they turned their faces away to avoid the other person’s breathing. The impossibility of getting help compounded the isolation. 850 Philadelphia doctors and more nurses were away in the military. More than that number were sick. Philadelphia General Hospital had 126 nurses. Despite all precautions, despite wearing surgical masks and gowns, eight doctors and fifty-four nurses—43 percent of the staff—themselves required hospitalization. Ten nurses at this single hospital died. The Board of Health pleaded for help from retired nurses and doctors if they remembered “even a little” of their profession.When a nurse or doctor or policeman did actually come, they wore their ghostly surgical masks, and people fled them. In every home where someone was ill, people wondered if the person would die. And someone was ill in every home...Starr went to Emergency Hospital #2 at Eighteenth and Cherry Streets. He did have help, if it could be called that, from an elderly physician who had not practiced in years and who brought Starr into touch with the worst of heroic medicine. Starr wouldn’t forget that, the ancient arts of purging, of venesection, the ancient art of opening a patient’s vein. But for the most part he and the other students elsewhere were on their own, with little help even from nurses, who were so desperately needed that in each of ten emergency hospitals supplied by the Red Cross only a single qualified nurse was available to oversee whatever women came as volunteers. And often the volunteers reported for their duty once and, from either fear or exhaustion, did not come again.Nearly 1/4 of all the patients in his hospital died each day. Starr would go home, and when he returned the next day, he would find that between one-quarter and one-fifth of the patients in the hospital had died, replaced by new ones... Virtually all of them, along with their friends and relatives, were terrified that, no matter how mild the symptoms seemed at first, within them moved an alien force, a seething, spreading infection, a live thing with a will that was taking over their bodies — and could be killing them...The city was frozen with fear, frozen into stillness. Starr lived 12 miles from the hospital. The streets were silent on his drive home, silent. They were so silent he took to counting the cars he saw. One night he saw no cars at all. He thought, “The life of the city had almost stopped.”
Everyone can read the collapse of official power in Philadelphia as supporting their politics. Anarchists can point to the benevolent spontaneous order that arose after the corrupt local government failed to act; libertarians can point out that this spontaneous order was all funded by the richest Philadelphians; statists can point out that, without actually-authoritative co-ordination, the effort eventually failed, because people defected against each other, in fear.
The corpses had backed up at undertakers’, filling every area of these establishments and pressing up into living quarters; in hospital morgues overflowing into corridors; in the city morgue overflowing into the street. And they had backed up in homes. They lay on porches, in closets, in corners of the floor, on beds. Children would sneak away from adults to stare at them, to touch them; a wife would lie next to a dead husband, unwilling to move him or leave him. The corpses, reminders of death and bringers of terror or grief, lay under ice at Indian-summer temperatures. Their presence was constant, a horror demoralizing the city; a horror that could not be escaped. Finally the city tried to catch up to them.The police wore their ghostly surgical masks, and people fled them, but the masks had no effect on the viruses and by mid-October thirty-three policemen had died, with many more to follow... More coffins came by rail, guarded by men with guns.
""There is, therefore, but one response possible from us: Force! force to the utmost, force without stint or limit, the righteous and triumphant force which shall make right the law of the world and cast every selfish dominion down in the dust. ""- Woodrow Wilson addressing one of his money-lending mobs.Wilson tends to be viewed pretty positively, just because he won. (""at last the world knows America as the savior of the world!"") But he perverted an entire state and nation to do so, ignored the terrible suffering of his own damn population for years, and refused a conditional peace with Austria in August and with the Kaiser's new parliament in September. (This meant 30-70 extra days of war, which, if this period was as lethal as the rest of the war, means up to 800,000 completely unnecessary deaths, not to mention the continuing waste of resources during the worst epidemic ever). Wilson did great evil, was not much different from the Kaiser, the election aside.
 the military suctioned more and more nurses and physicians into cantonments, aboard ships, into France, until it had extracted nearly all the best young physicians. Medical care for civilians deteriorated rapidly. The doctors who remained in civilian life were largely either incompetent young ones or those over forty-five years of age, the vast majority of whom had been trained in the old ways of medicine. 
Barry's middle chapters are a frightening portrait of how rabidly un-American the US was in 1918. The laws were bad enough - for instance the ban on criticising the government. But then there's the unofficial ""patriotic duties"", punishable by beatings. State-sponsored atavism.
By the summer of 1918, however, Wilson had injected the government into every facet of national life and had created great bureaucratic engines to focus all the nation’s attention and intent on the war.He had created a Food Administration to control and distribute food, a Fuel Administration to ration coal and gasoline, a War Industries Board to oversee the entire economy. He had taken all but physical control over the railroads and had created a federally sponsored river barge line that brought commerce back to life on the Mississippi River, a commerce that had been killed by competition from those railroads. He had built many dozens of military installations, each of which held at least tens of thousands of soldiers or sailors. He had created industries that made America’s shipyards teem with hundreds of thousands of laborers launching hundreds of ships, dug new coal mines to produce coal for the factories that weaned America’s military from British and French weapons and munitions—for, unlike in World War II, America was no arsenal of democracy.He had created a vast propaganda machine, an internal spy network, a bond-selling apparatus... He had even succeeded in stifling speech, in the summer of 1918 arresting and imprisoning — some for prison terms longer than ten years —not just radical labor leaders and editors of German-language newspapers but powerful men, even a congressman.He had injected the government into American life in ways unlike any other in the nation’s history. And the final extension of federal power had come only in the spring of 1918, after the first wave of influenza had begun jumping from camp to camp, when the government expanded the draft from males between the ages of twenty-one and thirty to those between the ages of eighteen and forty-five. Only on May 23, 1918, had Provost Marshal Enoch Crowder, who oversaw the draft, issued his “work or fight” order, stating that anyone not employed in an essential industry would be drafted...Crowder bragged about doing “in a day what the Prussian autocracy had been spending nearly fifty years to perfect...""In mid-August, as the lethal wave of the epidemic was gathering itself, Austria had already inquired about peace terms, an inquiry that Wilson rebuffed utterly. And as the epidemic was gathering full momentum, peace was only weeks away. Bulgaria had signed an armistice on September 29. On September 30, Kaiser Wilhelm had granted parliamentary government to the German nation; that same day Ludendorff had warned his government that Germany must extend peace feelers or disaster—immediate disaster—would follow. German diplomats sent out those feelers. Wilson ignored them. The Central Powers, Germany and her allies, were simultaneously breaking off one from one another and disintegrating internally as well. In the first week of October, Austria and Germany separately sent peace feelers to the Allies, and on October 7, Austria delivered a diplomatic note to Wilson formally seeking peace on any terms Wilson chose. Ten days later — days of battle and deaths — the Austrian note remained unanswered.Earlier Wilson had spoken of a “peace without victory,” believing only such a peace could last. But now he gave no indication that the war would soon be over. Although a rumor that the war had ended sent thrills through the nation, Wilson quickly renounced it. Nor would he relent. He was not now fighting to the death; he was fighting only to kill...If Wilson and his government would not be turned from his end even by the prospect of peace, they would hardly be turned by a virus. And the reluctance, inability, or outright refusal of the American government to shift targets would contribute to the killing. Wilson took no public note of the disease, and the thrust of the government was not diverted. The relief effort for influenza victims would find no assistance in the Food Administration or the Fuel Administration or the Railroad Administration. From neither the White House nor any other senior administration post would there come any leadership, any attempt to set priorities, any attempt to coordinate activities, any attempt to deliver resources....the military would give no help to civilians. Instead it would draw further upon civilian resources. The same day that Welch had stepped out of the autopsy room at Devens and called Gorgas’s office, his warning had been relayed to the army chief of staff, urging that all transfers be frozen unless absolutely necessary and that under no circumstances transfers from infected camps be made... Gorgas’s superiors ignored the warning. There was no interruption of movement between camps whatsoever; not until weeks later, with the camps paralyzed and, literally, tens of thousands of soldiers dead or dying, did the army make any adjustments.
Because the disease was everywhere, ravaging the entire species (and beyond), the book can't cover everything. Very little is said about non-Americans, i.e about 98% of the death and chaos. This is partly because there just isn't a lot of evidence about them, despite their influenza immunity and medical care being even worse. (This is why the top estimates reach 100m deaths, three times the median estimate.) Here is a passage about just a tiny number of them, in the north:
In Alaska, whites protected themselves. Sentries guarded all trails, and every person entering the city was quarantined for five days. Eskimos had no such luck. A senior Red Cross official warned that without “immediate medical assistance the race” could become “extinct.”...The navy provided the collier USS Brutus to carry a relief expedition... They found terrible things. One doctor visited ten tiny villages and found “three wiped out entirely; others average 85% deaths… Survivors generally children… probably 25% frozen to death before help arrived.”The virus probably did not kill all of them directly. But it struck so suddenly it left no one well enough to care for any others, no one to get food, no one to get water. And those who could have survived, surrounded by bodies, bodies of people they loved, might well have preferred to go where their family had gone, might well have wanted to no longer be alone... Two hundred sixty-six people had lived in Okak, and many dogs, dogs nearly wild. When the virus came, it struck so hard so fast people could not care for themselves or feed the dogs. The dogs grew hungry, crazed with hunger, devoured each other, then wildly smashed through windows and doors, and fed... In all of Labrador, at least one-third the total population died. 
---Barry commits at least one big error: he's horrified by the medical schools of the time having ""no standards for admission"":
 In research and education especially, American medicine lagged far behind [European medicine]... At least one hundred US medical schools would accept any man willing to pay tuition... and only a single medical school required its student to have a college degree... the Johns Hopkins itself, not student fees, paid [its] faculty salaries, and it required medical students to have not only a college degree but fluency in French and German and a background of science courses. 
But his enthusiasm for Johns Hopkins introducing the college degree requirement is misplaced. Contemporary US doctors (who all have 3 years of pre-med, or even more college, before they start medical training) are probably no better clinicians than undergraduate doctors in other countries, and are far further in debt. This requirement is probably one reason the American system is so fucked.I suppose Barry is just confusing the open admissions situation with the schools' appallingly low graduation standards, which is certainly one reason eC20th medicine sucked. (Many doctors had never looked down a microscope, never used a stethoscope on a patient, never seen a dissection.)---PS: Mostly unimportant corrections by a virologist here. Reply to these from Barry here."
84,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22063432-tom-mathews,5,"The old adage that 'those who fail to learn from the past are condemned to repeat it' has never been so true. President George W. Bush read this book shortly after it was published and was so impressed by the threat of future pandemics that he commissioned a department whose sole function was to prepare for future pandemics. This involved cooperation by federal, state and international entities (such as the WHO) to set up surveillance networks for potentially deadly diseases and to stockpile drugs and equipment such as mechanical ventilators that could be used in the event of a sharp spike in the number of inpatient hospitalizations. Unfortunately, the current president quickly defunded and essentially disbanded all of President Bush's efforts to prepare for what scientists and even foresighted politicians knew was inevitable. In his book, Barry wrote of the things that people did to protect themselves in 1918-19 and recommendations for what we could do when the next pandemic occurred. There was actually very few differences between the two lists: masks, hand-washing, social distancing and the cancelling of large gatherings being prominent on both lists. Barry asserted that our greatest chance of preventing a full-scale calamity lay in forethought and preparation. We will never know if that would have had much of an impact. When Barry wrote this book he likely couldn't have foreseen the political situation the U.S. finds itself in today but he knew politicians. He knew that in order to avoid boosting the enemy's morale in wartime, our leaders refused to speak honestly about the seriousness of the influenza pandemic and, as a result, millions died. But if he thought that politicians today were any better, he likely wouldn't have written in the afterward of one edition ""On a larger scale, and far more difficult, will be getting governments to tell the truth about the disease. This is perhaps the biggest lesson about 1918 and it is a lesson not yet learned.""I try to avoid revealing spoilers in my reviews but these are unusual times and I think that the best way to close this review is to let Barry do it for me. Here are the closing paragraphs in this magnificent work:
So the final lesson of 1918, a simple one yet one most difficult to execute, is that those who occupy positions of authority must lessen the panic that can alienate all within a society. Society cannot function if it is every man for himself. By definition, civilization cannot survive that. Those in authority must retain the public’s trust. The way to do that is to distort nothing, to put the best face on nothing, to try to manipulate no one. Lincoln said that first, and best. A leader must make whatever horror exists concrete. Only then will people be able to break it apart.

86,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4739424-mal-warwick,5,"A century ago a pandemic disease far more lethal than COVID-19 killed an estimated fifty to one hundred million people around the world—as many as one out of every twenty people then alive. The 1918 flu epidemic erupted during a war that had already killed tens of millions and at a time when medical science was far less accomplished than it is today. Although there are lessons to learn for our response to COVID-19, it’s important to view what happened then in its historical context. And that’s the approach John M. Barry so brilliantly takes in The Great Influenza. This engrossing book may well be one of the very best ever written on medical history.The historical context of the 1918 flu epidemicAs Barry makes clear, medical science had taken big steps forward in the decades before the pandemic erupted, especially in the United States. Half a century earlier, German researchers, and French to a lesser extent, led the world in medical research. However, by the outbreak of World War I, two institutions had spearheaded immense advances in American medicine: Johns Hopkins Hospital and the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research (later Rockefeller University).Johns Hopkins Hospital, founded in 1889, had been established expressly to bring the scientific method into the teaching and practice of medicine in the United States. The Rockefeller Institute set out from day one to become the world’s most important medical research institution, and many observers have expressed the opinion that it succeeded very shortly after its establishment in 1901. Barry traces the evolution of both Johns Hopkins and the Rockefeller (as they were then known) through in-depth sketches of the prominent physicians who led them. Those doctors, the heroes of the tale, played leadership roles in combating the 1918 flu epidemic, advising the military and government at all levels on precautionary measures and researching the origins of the disease and possible treatment. Unfortunately, they made little headway in either respect.Why the disease spread so widely and so quicklyThe doctors’ increasingly strident insistence on warning the public about the epidemic were met with rigid resistance until hundreds of thousands of Americans had already died. The Wilson administration had instituted draconian measures to prevent any news from reaching the public that would turn its attention from the need to support the war effort. Although press censorship was not in force, the nation’s press almost uniformly self-censored, parroting the official line that the disease was not serious while bodies piled up in the morgues. The result then, as it is today in the COVID-19 pandemic, was that those who denied the problem lost the public’s trust. But the biggest reason the influenza spread so widely and so quickly was the insistence of the US Army on transferring troops in large numbers from one base to another in crowded trains and then overseas in crowded ships.The 1918 flu epidemic was “the deadliest pandemic in history”Although up to five percent of the world’s population—and “as many as 8 to 10 percent of all young adults then living—died from the so-called “Spanish influenza,” its impact was not limited to the appalling death toll. Naturally, the pandemic greatly influenced the course of medical research and the adoption of public health measures far more widely than had been the case. But its consequences were far-reaching both in the conduct of World War I and in the shape of the peace that emerged from the conflict. Barry skillfully explores both themes in The Great Influenza.How the epidemic helped defeat GermanyIn April 1918, German commander Erich Ludendorff began “his last great offensive—Germany’s last real chance to win the war. The . . . offensive made great initial gains.” But then it stalled. Barry quotes the diary of a US Army surgeon stationed near the front: “‘The expected third phase of the great German offensive gets put off from day to day . . . I gather that the epidemic of grippe which hit us rather hard in Flanders also hit the Boche worse, and this may have caused the delay.'” In fact, Ludendorff himself “blamed influenza for the loss of initiative and the ultimate failure of the offensive.” No single battle necessarily changes the course of any war (although Midway, Stalingrad, and the Normandy Invasion are all claimed to have done just that in the next war.) But contemporary observers in 1918, and military analysts now, seem to agree that however slim the likelihood that Germany might end up victorious was certainly then lost.How the 1918 flu epidemic helped cause World War IIHistorians agree that the Treaty of Versailles that brought World War I to a close was a disaster. The excessive pain it imposed on Germany is almost universally acknowledged to have led in virtually a straight line to the Second World War. Yet that treaty took the form it did only because, midway through the peace conference, the world’s most popular statesman, Woodrow Wilson, suddenly and unaccountably “abandoned principles he had previously insisted upon. He yielded to [French Prime Minister Georges] Clemenceau everything of significance Clemenceau wanted, virtually all of which Wilson had earlier opposed.” Clemenceau was the primary architect of the harsh provisions incorporated into the treaty.Most accounts of Wilson’s strange turnabout at Versailles ascribe it to a minor stroke he suffered. The President was, in fact, in his sickbed when he made the fateful decision. However, Barry cites powerful evidence that Wilson had not in fact suffered a stroke. He had the flu. “Wilson’s actual symptoms—including high fever, severe coughing, and total prostration, [were] all symptoms that perfectly fit influenza and have no association whatsoever with stroke . . . Indeed, the virus may have contributed to the [severe] stroke” Wilson suffered much later that incapacitated him and led to his death.Where the “Spanish flu” really originatedWithin months of its appearance in the United States, the 1918 flu epidemic quickly went pandemic throughout Western Europe. The “Great War” was in its final months at the time, and rigid press censorship was in force on both sides of the trenches. Thus, even though thousands of American, French, British, and German troops were falling ill throughout the war zone, no news about their plight reached the home front in any one of the combatant countries. Neutral Spain, however, was different. There, alarmist reports about the virulence of the fast-spreading disease were splashed all over front pages. And that was how the epidemic came to be dubbed the “Spanish flu.”In fact, as Barry reports in detail, the deadly strain of H1N1 influenza at the heart of the 1918 flu epidemic almost certainly originated in Haskell County, Kansas, early that year. From there, the disease made its way eastward to a huge army “cantonment” where tens of thousands of troops were preparing to be shipped to France as cannon fodder for “Black Jack” Pershing‘s push against the German lines. Tens of thousands never made it there, falling victim instead to the flu. And, in carrying the disease to Europe, they triggered its spread to both Allied and enemy troops as well as civilian populations throughout Western Europe and ultimately to the rest of the world.How the 1918 flu epidemic was different from COVID-19In two major respects, the pandemic of a century ago differed significantly from what we are experiencing as I write:** Influenza is a respiratory disease that primarily attacks the lungs, nose, and throat. When it kills, it does so primarily through pneumonia. Although COVID-19 was initially feared to be similar in its effects, it is in truth a vascular disease that manifests through the circulatory system. ** It’s difficult for scientists to calculate the mortality (death) rate of a disease. But it is clear that the H1N1 influenza virus that emerged in 1918 was far more lethal than the COVID-19 strains that have been seen to date. Hundreds of thousands are dying today. Eventually, it seems likely that globally millions will do so. But it seems highly unlikely that the death toll will rise into the tens of millions as was the case a century ago.However, there is one significant way in which the two pandemics are similar. History tends to refer to the earlier pandemic as the “1918 flu epidemic,” suggesting that a first, relatively mild strain broke out in the spring of that year, followed by a second, far more lethal strain in the fall. In fact, though, the second wave lasted until 1919—and there was a third wave in 1920. Medical researchers tell us that COVID-19 is almost certain to behave in a similar fashion. As I write, we are experiencing either the first or the second wave of the disease (the experts differ). Yet another outbreak seems certain, with or without the speedy development of a vaccine—polyannish predictions to the contrary notwithstanding."

Outside of these few very well-known accounts, there is almost nothing in literature about it afterwards. They write about horrors that people inflict on people. Apparently they forget the horrors that nature inflicts on people, the horrors that make humans least significant. And yet the pandemic resonated.” Times like these only help us get perspective, Human race suffers from Amnesia and keeps forgetting the one and biggest truth of all. As Nietzsche's said - ""In some remote corner of the universe, poured out and glittering in innumerable solar systems, there once was a star on which clever animals invented knowledge. That was the highest and most mendacious minute of ""world history""—yet only a minute. After nature had drawn a few breaths the star grew cold, and the clever animals had to die."" We are nothing but a speck of dust in the grand scheme of things and times like these keep reminding us that. But times likes also explain why we are most thriving species on the earth today. We have invented these abstract concepts of ""Love"" , ""Compassion"" and ""Hope"" and that's what defines us. At the end this will be over I hope we are able to learn something out of this. This is an amazing read in my mind. The book not just telling the story of the pandemic but the foundations of the medical science in America. The author has done an amazing job covering different aspect of those times and I can certainly draw similarities in the current ongoing situations. It has definitely given me perspective. Help me interpret the media ( social/news) and conceive a bigger picture. "

The early history of the practice medicine in this country and lack of training of the doctors was jaw dropping. During WWI, academic instruction in general suffered due to total commitment to the war effort. ""In view of the comparatively short time during which most of the student-soldiers will remain in college and the exacting military duties awaiting them, academic instruction must necessarily be modified along the lines of direct military value.""I appreciated the great detail used in explaining the scientific rigor in trying to understand the disease that was plaguing the country and world. All the dead ends and false leads with persistent desperate scientists trying to find the answers in the midst of horror.""These things become easy to discern in hindsight. But how does one know when to persist, when to continue to try to make an experiment work, when to make adjustments - and when finally to abandon a line of thought as mistaken or incapable of solution with present techniques?How does one know when to do either?""With headlines starting to appear again about the danger from the Swine Flu which we might face in the fall, this book should be widely read and attention paid."

We'll see...2/28/18 REVIEW: Sigh, giving up on this book and marking it DNF. It's bloated and repetitive and verbose and wordy and ... umm, did I mention it's repetitive? I don't know if it's poorly-written or poorly-edited, but there were places were the same thing was said within pages of each other. And boring?!? Honestly, I was looking for a book about the flu to read during flu-season (especially in the year I decided NOT to get the flu shot), and all we get is lengthy biographies about the doctors and people who... well, I'm not even sure how most of them are important to the story. Really, when you pick up a book about a deadly disease you want to read about the deadly disease, and not wait for a couple hundred pages for it to appear or get good. The book is going back on the shelf but I guess I'll leave my bookmark where it is, just in case I get really bored."
90,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72479728-bryan-alkire,3,"Turned out to be ok, but given my high expectations for the book, ultimately disappointing. Before I get talk about the book itself, I’d like to say a few words about the peril of popular historical analogy. Really, this current Corona virus and the 1918 flu are not equivalent. Different diseases different times different responses. For starters, 1918 was a war economy. If people had chirped about lack of toilet paper or individual rights to be out and about, they would have been swiftly muzzled. Second, the government involvement at the federal level was vastly different. In 1918 the federal government did absolutely nothing, tot even brave words of comfort, for civilians suffers the flu. Today the government is throwing massive amounts of money at the problem even if it is at the behest of business special interests. At least the government is trying something. In fact, the only thing similar is that local governments are bearing the brunt of the response and that said response is a patchwork and that the media is following local government lead, in 1918 largely silent about the danger, in 2020 loudly proclaiming from the rooftops about the dangers. The last difference is the most important, different diseases. The 1918 flu struck quickly with a 48 to 72-hour incubation period and often killed suddenly as short as 12 hours after symptoms largely because the body’s immune system had to mount such a vigorous defense that if killed the body in the process. This corona virus is a two-week incubation period and seems to be more of a slow and more predictable killer.  Hopefully you’re still reading at this point as I will now discuss the book. I like books on pandemics when I can find them. They’re interesting and often draw lessons, usually for apocalypse writers, but unfortunately, real life currently. I chose this book because it’s the popular definitive work on the 1918 flu and that’s where the book falls short. The The organization of this book is just bad. It’s a confusing narrative structure with no real timeline and constant doubling back and forth interspersed with chapters on diseases and the like. It’s extremely repetitive. The writing is uneven. Sometimes it slows admirably and at other times gets bogged down in statistics and detail. The book also becomes awfully dry at times, particularly when discussing diseases themselves in quite detailed fashion. The content is also uneven. There’s lots here which isn’t truly relevant like medical school history and the life stories of doctors whose insolvent with the flu was more administrate than actual work. In short, this book was just a mess and clearly there was no good editing done on it. This book could have been a lot better than it was. So, I give this a 3. It’s interesting and at times, quite readable and even compelling. But, it’s dismally organized and edited. It could have been much better. "
91,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12087691-wendyb,5," A must-read book for the times we live in.Starts out with maybe just a little too much background on some of the doctors involved in the 1918 flu research but still interesting info on the state of medicine at that time.Got really interesting with the info on the start of the flu and the effect on the population.In researching my family background, I discovered my grandparents' first child died in Oct 1918 of the Spanish Flu at just 12 days old. So in some small ways, this history still touches us today."
92,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5364077-connie-g,4,"The great influenza pandemic of 1918-1920 killed between 20 to 100 million people worldwide, more fatalities than any other pandemic in history. Unlike most influenza, this one targeted young people in their 20s and 30s. Although it's called the Spanish flu because the Spanish press had extensive coverage of the disease, it's thought to have originated in Kansas. Soldiers carried the disease as they traveled between crowded military facilities, then crossed the Atlantic on crowded boats to fight in World War I.Author John M. Barry also writes about the advances in medical education and medical research in the United States which occurred just before the pandemic. The Johns Hopkins Medical School and the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research were highlighted. He goes into great detail describing the lives and work of the medical researchers. While the pandemic was raging, researchers were not able to identify the viral pathogen, and many thought that the bacteria causing secondary infections was responsible. The book contains excellent descriptions of how a virus attacks human cells and replicates in the body. The mutation of viruses and the development of vaccines are also discussed.Barry also writes about the way politics and misinformation from public officials exacerbated the pandemic of 1918. Although the book was written in 2004, it has warnings that are important today during the COVID crisis. This timely book is interesting and well researched, although some readers may find there is too much detail about the medical schools and researchers."
93,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2190636-joselito-honestly-and-brilliantly,5,"The 1918 Flu Pandemic coincided with the First World War and it killed more than both the military and civilian casualties of the conflict yet while the war generated an avalanche of literature (poems, songs, music, fiction, films, biographies and autobiographies) not much serious work had been done about this pandemic until this book published in 2004.I read this a few years back and I’ve disposed of my copy already but since it was a gripping, unforgettable read, I could still recall some tidbits of information about this 1918 pandemic in relation with what we are now experiencing during the present one.First of all, and this is what is often found to be the most surprising about whatever virus was it which caused the 1918 pandemic, the most vulnerable was those who were physically fit and at the prime of their lives (think those in their 20’s or 30’s who eat healthy and go to the gym). Contrast this with with most of the present Covid 19 fatalities who are old and who had pre-existing health issues. But why is that? For some reasons, the body’s immune system or antibodies react to the 1918 virus in a weird way. They overreact or overdo things. The analogy is that when a fly (the virus) enters a house (the human body) someone drops an atom bomb (the antibodies) on it to kill the fly and because of it even the house is completely destroyed. So that is why it was the healthy and the strong who mostly died: they were the ones with stronger antibodies.Secondly, the incubation period for the 1918 virus was apparently shorter. I think there was a story in the book about someone talking gaily on a street, apparently healthy, then in just an hour or so would die there in that same place. Or a bus of healthy-looking people stopping before it reaches its destination because its driver (with 6 of its passengers) dropping dead.The 1918 pandemic killed about 100 Million people worldwide. No one knew how it was stopped. Probably it just got tired of killing people."

The book is very dry to read. The writing is repetitive and it drags on and on. Part 1 is the development of American medical science (public health study, John Hopkins Medical School etc...). Part 2 is mostly US politics (Woodrow Wilson, WWI and how wartime censorship was implemented). The rest is about the pandemic. The book should be better titled as ""The Great Influenza and How the US Dealt With It"", because it covers only a little outside the United States.At least 50m people (5% world population) had been wiped out by the pandemic, which is equivalent to 390m people today. There were three waves in the pandemic, the second wave the worst. In US, the condition in East Coast was worse than the west coast. San Francisco managed relatively well among big cities in US. Scientists did not find out the pathogen until many years later. The genome of the virus was sequenced in 2005.What strikes me most is that how the US politics today regarding Covid-19 has much in common with what happened in the 1918-1919 pandemic.

98,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35645863-lena,5,"Beyond five stars. How many books are entertaining, important, engaging and edifying? I can only think of one, this one.  I thought this was going to read like a thriller by Michael Crichton or Dan Brown following a plucky single doctor who fights hard for his patients, makes a breakthrough, and saves the day. That's not this book because that's definitely not what happened. The book starts off with a history of medicine. I had a vague idea about this beginning with Hypocrites and then jumping to those bleeders in Period dramas that announce, ""He's not long for this world."" with much in between. But there wasn't much in between and that's the problem.    While the other sciences moved in leaps and bounds medicine did not. There were lightbulbs and trains and the doctor was still coming to bleed you. Barry gives two reasons for this stagnation. The first is the anathema of autopsy. For the longest time it was simply unthinkable to cut into and examine a human being, it was too close to butchers work. Then there was a religious stigma attached but even in the twentieth century the liberal gods spoke out against it. Hell, even today hardened cops don't like attending autopsies.The second reason is a little trickier to understand - medicine is not logical like the other sciences. Barry gives an excellent example. A doctor in the early 1900s noticed that the face flushed during fever so he reasoned that fever could be a capillary issue. To test his theory he bled his fever patients. They went pale, their temperature dropped, and they were ravenous for food and drink. A cure! He published his finding, which was easily replicated, and was much lauded by the medical community. It was perfectly logical. It was wrong. Due to this reputation for butchery, witchery, and general ineffectiveness, being a doctor was not a respected profession. Medical schools were shockingly bad pass/fail systems where teacher salaries were based on butts in seats. Things changed quickly when they changed and you'll have to read the book to find out. This was the first book I read in 2016 and here I sit on the last evening of the year trying to finish this review. It was not mere procrastination; I was daunted by how much I enjoyed, learned, and was affected by this book. I became a vegetarian for four months and switched out all my beauty products to the more expensive cruelty free lines. And that was not even the point of the book. This entire review and I haven't even mentioned the word flu. Sigh. Just read it. *special thanks to my 2015 Secret Santa Krystal!"
99,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1649751-florence,4,"This is a very frightening book. We usually consider the flu to be a non life threatening disease. Not true in 1918. The disease killed millions in a worldwide pandemic. The actual number of fatalities can never be known because medical systems were so overwhelmed that many people were dying at home without ever seeing a medical professional. The grisly details of how ordinary people suffered are in this comprehensive book. Also covered are scientific descriptions of bacteria and viruses that a reader without a scientific background can comprehend. The pandemic seemed to be a perfect storm. President Woodrow Wilson was myopically focused on victory overseas as the Great War raged on. He made a fateful decision to send ailing troops to Europe, disregarding the advice of military health experts, exponentially expanding the disease to Europe. It took over 20 years to identify the virus that causes influenza. Initially it is transferred from an animal and has the diabolic ability to rapidly mutate to a form that can be spread among humans. Can a pandemic of this scope occur again? Almost certainly."
100,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/241691-kay,3,"""One always tends to overpraise a long book because one has got through it."" – E.M. ForsterIt took me the better part of the summer to listen to this audiobook in my car (I don't drive that much) -- and I confess that it soon became more of a chore than a pleasure. I do wish there had been a competently edited abridged version, for if ever a book cried out for editing, it was this one. Some of the book's strengths, however, include the exhaustive account of how the pandemic started and spread, not to mention the effect it had on society. There was a huge amount of material on how the authorities (mostly didn't) deal with the crisis, one of the key themes of the book being that in order to deal with such a threat that the civil authorities need to be completely honest about it. Point taken, but it was repeated over and over and over.... as were the somewhat melodramatic accounts of how the bodies stacked up, what having the disease was like, what the death toll was, and so on and so forth. Another strength was the intimate portraits of key researchers who rushed to find the cause of -- and a vaccine for -- the particularly virulent strain of influenza. There was a problem, though, in that the book's entire first section was a somewhat tedious historical account of the Johns Hopkins Institute. I'm still not sure why that was necessary (and suspect it wasn't). Granted, it was good to know what the state of medicine was at the turn of the century, but such an overview certainly could have been done more concisely. I also had real issues with the way several medical researchers, and in particular Paul Lewis, were cast into ""roles"" -- with Lewis the tragic figure that the author claimed was ""the last victim"" of the pandemic. Humph!However, I did find it fascinating to read about the details and design of medical research, and in particular how viruses mutated and became more or less deadly. In fact, I wished for a bit more of that information and less of the endless parade of statistics that Barry seemed so inordinately fond of. I came to believe that he had never met a statistic he didn't like (or subsequently use). Again, I was puzzled about why the editors hadn't intervened and winnowed out the repetitious material. Scott Brick, the reader for this book, was one of the biggest irritants, however, and no doubt significantly contributed to my feeling that the book was NEVER going to end. While his voice wasn't an unpleasant one, he seemed to have a very narrow ""range"" of intonation and emphasis. In fact, it sounded like he was overemphasizing just about everything, and he had a particular way of lingering over and stressing the word ""any"" that made me want to shriek after the first few hours. I had a hard time separating my irritation with his reading from my general impatience with the book, which is probably the reason I gave this three stars rather than two -- I'm not entirely sure whose fault it was that I didn't find this as interesting as I'd expected. (Plus, as Forster noted, one DOES tend to overpraise a long book that one finally manages to finish.) If I'd been reading this book rather than listening to it, undoubtedly I would have been able to skim pretty efficiently, slowing down for the parts that interested me the most and just skipping over the repetitive bits. But as a ""captive"" listener, it was pretty tough going. "
101,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/541670-caroline,2,"I had no less than four people come up to me while I was reading this book and tell me how great it was. Apparently it also made quite a splash at USAID when it was published. Maybe that's why three out of the four people who approached me were coworkers.It's possible these endorsements gave me unrealistic expectations, because by the time I finished it I was practically pulling my hair out. Which is a bummer because I was super excited to read The Great Influenza. I love books about medicine and medical history, so it wasn't the subject, it was what story author John Barry chose (tried?) to tell.An anecdote: Occasionally in high school, I would hit a particularly difficult calculus problem and seek out my mechanical engineer father for help. I'd show him the problem, perhaps a particularly pernicious related rate problem. Instead of starting from the problem itself, my dad always wanted to make sure I understood all of the individual concepts required to complete it. The running joke is that if I came to him with a calculus problem, he'd start no later in the material than the formal definition of a derivative and go from there. It would take several chapters worth of content before we arrived at the actual matter at hand. I still enjoy ribbing my dad about his approach to calculus assistance. He's sitting across the room from me right now and when I told him what I was writing he just grinned and declared ""First principles! You must build block by block on first principles!"" Hello, Dad who I've exaggerated for comedic effect, meet John M. Barry.John Barry started this book with Hippocrates and Galen. He then spent 166 pages getting from ancient Greece to the scientific revolution in American medicine that occurred in the early 20th century. He provides painstaking detail surrounding the creation of Johns Hopkins University (to be fair, this was pretty interesting, it's just... not the 1918 influenza pandemic). He introduces a small army of doctors, bacteriologists, and medical researchers, all of whom played a role in dragging medicine into the 20th century via the scientific method.Then, we have a mighty record scratch and Barry decides to spend about 200 pages on the 1918 epidemic itself. The majority of individuals introduced in the first section of the book take a backseat to an almost mind-numbing number of U.S. military cantonments, local and national politicians, and morbidity and mortality statistics. The level of detail is overwhelming and largely made my eyes glaze over. Frustratingly, this part of the book felt almost entirely disconnected from the medical history discussed earlier. Due to the severity of the pandemic, the carefully laboratory work according to the scientific method had to be discarded for shortcuts and best guesses. I figured Barry would highlight this irony and while he mentioned it a time or two, he for the most part just kept barreling forward through the history.Record scratch number two. With the end of the pandemic, we return to a smaller subset of the cast of characters discussed prior to its arrival and follow their lives and research down a number of paths that are only tangentially related (if at all) to influenza. Many of the most important individuals from the first part of the book are discarded without providing any sort of conclusion to their story.The whole thing was immensely aggravating. Whenever I look at a marble sculptures in art museums, I marvel at the fact that a sculptor was able to look at a block of stone, see the figure within, and get rid of the extra to reveal what was there all along. The Great Influenza felt like John M. Barry looking at a block of marble, seeing David, sculpting away, and instead revealing a figure with six arms, two heads, and feet erupting Alien-like from its chest. There are probably two and a half good books contained within, but Barry couldn't see what to get rid of and editor Wendy Wolf certainly didn't take a firm enough hand. I'm genuinely alarmed at the thought of what this book looked like pre-editor after reading the bloated and muddled final result. Here's the kicker: in the acknowledgements, John Barry pulls back the curtain on the process of writing the book and fully reveals his obliviousness. Get a load of this:""This book was initially supposed to be a straightforward story of the deadliest epidemic in human history, told from the perspectives of both scientists who tried to fight it and political leaders who tried to respond to it. I though it would take me two and a half years to write, three at the most. That plan didn't work. Instead this book took seven years to write. It has evolved (and, I hope, grown) into something rather different than originally conceived.""NO JOHN, THE NEW PLAN PLAN DIDN'T WORK. YOU SHOULD HAVE STUCK WITH THE ORIGINAL. Seven years. Holy crud.Other nits to pick: I often felt like Barry had an agenda to push. At various times in the book, he would stake out rather extreme positions and seemed to only approach the history from that angle, with Wilson's approach to World War I and the U.S. military's approach to the pandemic being two of the major examples. Were either perfect? Certainly not, but Barry seemed almost to cast them as the villains of the influenza pandemic, a practice I found unhelpful. I was also distinctly uncomfortable with an insinuation Barry made about the death of Paul A. Lewis. Implying suicide shouldn't be thrown around without evidence, and Barry provided nothing concrete. Not cool, dude.The writing is also nothing to write home about. Barry has an annoying habit of repeating anecdotes throughout the book and if I see the sentence ""It was influenza, only influenza"" one more time, I might scream.It's probably 1.5 stars but I'm rounding up. So why two instead of one? I did learn some things and a number of individual threads in the book were interesting. Highlights include a better understanding of why Johns Hopkins has the reputation it does, what the Hs and Ns are in influenza (ex: the H1N1 strain), and the word enzootic*.In all honesty, though, I'd probably pass on this one. You can learn the bulk of the 1918 influenza-specific stuff more quickly and enjoyably via Wikipedia. *It is to animals what the word ""epidemic"" is to humans, which makes sense given the roots. I'm distinctly less excited about it now, though, having just looked up the pronunciation and realized that it is pronounced en-zoh-AH-tic instead of en-ZOO-tic. I suppose you can't win them all."
102,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3244513-mike,4,"Overall this was a very good book. Expansive, thorough, and at times utterly fascinating. I'm sure people around me are completely sick of me talking about the flu at this point but this is that kind of book that will do that to you. It falls short of getting five stars for a couple of reasons, some of which are about the book but most of which are about me as a reader:1. It's almost too expansive: In Barry's quest to explore every possible nook and cranny of the 1918 Influenza pandemic he leaves no scientific idea or historical actor unearthed and thoroughly discussed. This lends to a skater shot feel to the book as you lurch from one person to another in chronological order with whole chapters about the science of viruses and bacteria popping up here and there to interrupt the forward momentum of the story. I feel like I got a about a dozen very short, somewhat shallow, biographies in this one book and a bit more science that I really wanted. 2. Lack of a supporting personal story or strong main character: When I contrast this book with Steven Johnson's ""Ghost Map"", which is all about John Snow and how he dealt with a cholera outbreak in London in the 19th Century, I find that it didn't hold my attention all the time because I didn't really connect with any of the people in the book or feel like there was a broad narrative that was pulling me along. Sure, he does a good job of showing how the pandemic began, how it peaks, and how it ebbs but the pandemic is far too amorphous for me to really relate to. And while he clearly shows how many of the people in the book react at these different phases I didn't really feel like I got to know any of them with the kind of detail that Johnson pulled out of John Snow.3. Hey, you got your science book in my history book! No, you got your history book in my science book! Wow, they're two great genres that kind of make for a confusing mess when you put them all together: Okay, this gripe is all about me as a reader. I'm WAY more interested in history and politics than science. Unless the science is about robots, zombies, or space ships at a certain point I kind of just zone out. Barry, at times, gets super deep on the science of influenza explaining in great detail how it infects the body and causes no end of problems. While it is a great feat of writing to talk about that sort of thing without losing the reader (to his credit it was never confusing) it doesn't make for a compelling read for me. When Barry talks about history in this book it's completely riveting, I literally couldn't put it down, but then there would be a speed bump science chapter and I'd have to slog through it to get back to the ideas that were the most interesting to me. It made for a frustrating read at times.Over all I would highly recommend this book. It really was quite good, my gripes aside. And, frankly, the historical implications of the book make it worth the read alone (namely that at a crucial junction in the negotiation of the Treaty of Versailles at the end of World War I Pres. Wilson came down with the flu and it, for a bunch of reasons, left him possibly permanently mentally impaired - he believed from that point on that French spies had infiltrated the White House for example - is shocking. Given that that treaty is often held directly responsible for the rise of Nazi Germany, and World War II, and that the principle features of that treaty may have caused the rise of the Nazi's were almost all pushed by the French and opposed by Pres. Wison, until his bought with the flu that is, one is left believing if not for the flu the world could have been very different). If you like science and enjoy history I think this would be a very satisfying reading experience.As an aside, I gave this book to my Grandmother for Christmas in 2009 when she was 91 years old. She and I developed a pattern late in her life of me giving her books that I'd read that I liked for birthdays and Christmas. She was an avid reader and game to read anything, although like me her preferences were more inclined to history, biography, and travel. This was one of the rare books I gave her without reading first. When I asked her, on Christmas 2011, to lend me one of her favorite books she gave me this one. She was born in April of 1918, near the beginning of this book, and I think for her the book explained a lot of things people would mention in her childhood that never made much sense (relatives who died during the flu, particular idioms people would use, or beliefs they had about sickness). She died in March of 2012 just a month shy of 94. In reading this book I am profoundly impressed by her intelligence. This book is not an easy read in spots (there were sections I read twice) and for someone who didn't even finish high school to read this book and not only understand it but enjoy it is a testament to the amazing person she was. This book still has the post-it note she always put on the inside front cover of books she got as gifts with the date, occasion, and person(s) who gave it to her. While she may be gone it makes me happy that she and I could at least share this one last experience together. "
103,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/82228946-nightlights,5,"Thought about giving this book four stars for minor repetition but last few chapters, and the afterword was so profound that it made everything even out.Early in the chapters, a mini-memoir of prominent scientists felt a bit excessive. But once you finish this book, a different perspective arises. The sacrifice Paul Lewis made just broke my heart. 🥺😞 (((Stay Safe Everyone)))"
104,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1923002-mara,3,"Read it for a biotech class in college and really enjoyed it- I mean, it shined pretty brightly compared to my biochem textbook"
105,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/611813-melinda,4,"Re-reading again in 2020 in the middle of the coronavirus outbreak.This is an excellent book. Reading it in the time of Coronavirus is eye-opening. I wish that the shrill shrieking gerbils of the media would provide comparisons ""per population"" for their numbers, and also comparisons with the traditional flu. The 2nd half of the book is especially worthwhile in this time of pandemic.********I highly recommend this book! It reads like a ""who-done-it"", except that you know who did it (the influenza virus) and you are watching the medical scientists struggle to find solutions while the wild-fire of the 1918 influenza pandemic raged all around them. Will they find a solution in time? (see the bottom paragraph for an answer to this question)Before documenting the path of the 1918 influenza, the author lays the groundwork for the transformed medical atmosphere from the late 1800's into the early 1900's in America. This path thus shows the beginnings of the the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research, the Phipps Institute, and Johns Hopkins University. Names of medical pioneers and influenza warriors such as Paul Lewis (who proved that polio was caused by a virus in 1907 and developed a vaccine that was 100% effective in protecting monkeys), William Henry Welch (the single most powerful individual in the history of American medicine, who directed the rise of Johns Hopkins University, and who with John D. Rockefeller Jr. created the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research, arguablly the best scientific research institute in the world), Simon Flexner (first head of the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research, the man who brought the mortality rate for common bacterial meningitis down to 18% in 1919 WITHOUT antibiotics!), Rufus Cole (who made the Rockefeller Institute Hospital a model for the way clinical research is conducted), Army Surgeon General William Gorgas (whose work in abating the transmission of yellow fever and malaria by controlling the mosquitos saved hundreds of thousands of lives, and allowed construction on the Panama Canal), Oswald Avery (whose work on influenza would lead him to one of the most important scientific discoveries in the 20th century, that DNA is the material of which genes and chromosomes are made), Anna Wessel Williams (the leading female bacteriologist in the world who worked hand in hand with William Park trying to develop a serum or vaccine for influenza),William Park (teamed with Anna Wessel Williams, developed the diptheria antitoxin still in use today), andRichard Shope (who as the first to prove that a virus caused influenza) fill the pages of this book. After setting the stage with its influenza warriors and medical laboratories, the author then begins the saga of the influenza virus itself. Influenza struck in the first wave in the winter and spring of 1918, a mild ""three day fever"" form that most recovered from. The second wave hit in the fall of 1918. This wave was the most virulent and deadly. The third wave hit somewhere in the winter / spring of 1919, and was once again a less virulent form. In just 2 years the virus mutated into a super killer, then back into a more mild disease. In raw numbers, the lowest estimate of the worldwide death toll at the time was 20 million. Knowing what we know now, epidemiologists today estimate that influenza caused at least 50 million and possibly 100 million deaths worldwide. All that in a time when the population of the world was 1/3rd of what it is today. The terrifying aspect of the super killer influenza was that it did not strike the traditional victims... the old and the very young, but instead hit hardest in the age group of 20's and 30's. If the upper estimate of 100 million deaths is accurate, then 8 to 10 percent of all young adults then living were killed by the virus.And these deaths happened with blinding speed. The influenza pandemic stretched out over 2 years. But 2/3rds of the deaths occurred in a period of 24 weeks. That is about 66 million deaths in 24 weeks. Averaged out that would be 2.5 million deaths per week. Yet more than half of those 66 million deaths happened from mid-September to early December of 1918. That is really 33 million deaths in 10 to 12 weeks! That's 3.3 MILLION deaths PER WEEK in the late fall and early winter of 1918! And remember that the world population at the time was less than 1/3rd of what it is today (which is 6.8 billion people). The numbers are just staggering, and I had to keep reading them and figuring out the numbers and it still is a staggering thought. So many died in so short a time! Epidemiological evidence from the work of Dr. Loring Miner seems to show that the new influenza virus originated in Haskell County, Kansas early in the winter of 1918. Dr. Miner documented early cases of the new influenza that showed disturbing mortality rates in a very short period of time. The virus then went to a huge army base in the eastern part of the state as troops were gathered in preparation for their deployment to Europe for WWI. From that army base, soliders were sent to France, soldiers were transferred to other bases in the United States....and the disease began sweeping through North America, Europe, South America, Asia, Africa, and the entire world. Some situations requiring fast decision making in chaotic circumstances were carried out well. Other situations were not handled as well. The ins and outs of these crossing paths of decisions, deaths mounting rapidly, politics, mililtary directives, and newly formed medical laboratories make up the rest of the book. The story is staggering, but gripping. In answer to the question at the beginning of this review, the answer is ""no, the medical scientists did not find a solution during the time of the 1918 thru 1920 influenza pandemic"". They learned alot, yes. They also learned that the only way to be protected from the disease was through isolation from it. Medical practices helping and treating the ill were improved, but a vaccine was never been found. The only reason the killing influenza stopped killing was because it mutated away from the more virulent form into a milder form. So the question immediately to ask is ""what happens if the virus mutates back to the virulent form?"". And that is the question we are left with at the end of the book. In the concluding chapter, the author raises these issues and concludes tentatively that in pandemic times, an authorized power (government, World Health Organization, army, someone) must have the authority to act and to act quickly, and their decisions must trump individual freedoms. Mandatory vaccinations, mandatory quaranatine, mandatory travel restrictions are the things that must be done to protect the larger population. The ""needs of the many outweigh the needs of the one"", if I may quote a Star Trek movie. In times of such overwhelming medical need, quick decisions must be made and sometimes they must be harsh."
106,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2201886-mike,4,"[Since that book deals with epidemic disease, also. In the present there is a virulent influenza outbreak and in the past there is the plague sweeping through England. This book deals with the deadliest outbreak of virulent influenza so far which, at the time, was often thought to be a form of plague (because of extreme cyanosis). Neat, tie-in huh? (hide spoiler)]"
107,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4118002-jeanne,4,"The Great Influenza is a sobering story, especially in today’s climate. This well-researched book gives a detailed account of why this deadly pandemic devastated the world. A well-written history."
108,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10978428-jim,4,"The bodies were piling up. The undertakers, themselves falling sick, were overwhelmed. There was no place to put the bodies. Gravediggers were either sick or refused to bury the influenza victims. Caskets were stacking up...then they ran short of caskets. The city morgue filled up. The stench was terrible...this was Philadelphia, October 1918, the time of the so-called ""Spanish flu."" Barry gives us a panoramic view of the most lethal influenza outbreak in history which occurred in 1918-1919. Today we believe that the death toll in the United States was 675,000 out of a population of 105 million. As many as 100 million died worldwide out of a global population of 1.8 billion, more than 5% of the world's population.  Barry follows the movement of the flu virus across the world, starting in rural Kansas, where somehow the virus crossed the animal-human barrier (from chickens?). It erupted in an Army camp in Kansas and moved east with the soldiers and then went on the troopships with them to Europe...It came in three waves, that first wave that hit the soldiers in the spring of 1918 was rather mild. But then in the fall, there was the second wave that was much more virulent--that's when most of the deaths occurred. Then the virus mutated again and there was a third wave which hit places like Australia--which had not been hit so hard by the second wave. Much of the book is involved with the story of the scientists battling the virus. Barry goes into some detail about this and focuses on some key figures. As he explains, a revolution had occurred in American medicine where labs had been organized and work was going on with the expectation that disease could be conquered by modern science. When it came to the great influenza, science failed. We are still living with the consequences of that.  The book was published in 2004 and, in it, Barry warns that we will face another pandemic. It's only a question of when. He states that we are NOT prepared for a pandemic. The events of this year of 2020 shows that he was right."
109,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6949571-thomas-paul,5,"It killed more people in 6 months than the Black Death killed in a century. People who were young and strong were the most likely to die. In the US, 650,000 people died. The average life expectancy in the US went down by 10 years. Worldwide, perhaps 100 million people died. And yet, it was only the flu. Even today, 90 years after the epidemic, it kills 36,000 Americans in a typical year and we are hardly more prepared to face another epidemic.John M. Barry has written a fascinating account of the influenza epidemic of 1918. But the book is a lot more than just a review of the flu. Barry starts out by examining the state of the American health system at the time of the epidemic and how it reached that state. He explores the revolutionary changes to medicine that occurred in the late 19th and early 20th century and the people who led those changes. He shows us why, even today, a cure for influenza is beyond our reach, explaining in layman’s terms how the influenza virus changes to become deadly and changes again to lose that deadliness. He explains how an endemic virus can lead to an epidemic of unimagined proportions.Barry also shows how the demands of World War I on troop movements, the propaganda campaigns to keep morale high, and the failure of leaders to listen to the doctors and researchers led to a killing field of historic size. His account tends to concentrate on Philadelphia because the city was hit extremely hard and much of the research going on was near that city but he does cover other areas around the world hit hard by the virus, although his coverage of the flu outside of the US is sketchy at best. He gives us writings from diaries and newspaper articles to show what was actually happening and how the media tried to downplay the epidemic. He gives us detailed accounts of the research (and the researchers) that was done to fight the epidemic, explains why this research was mostly unsuccessful, and does it all in a way that is easy to understand even if you don’t have a medical degree.Barry likes to use foreshadowing, hints of what is to come, to keep the reader’s interest and it does work, even if it is a bit melodramatic. Even the chapter titles, “The Tinderbox”, “It Begins”, The Race”, provide some melodrama to the story. The book mostly moves at a good pace and I found myself having trouble putting it down. Barry has written a book that everyone should read, whether you are familiar with the epidemic or not. It is a fascinating, terrifying, detailed, and extremely important book."
110,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8298053-colleen-browne,3,"This book starts out with a summary of medicine from Hippocrates to the First World War. That seems like it would be a long slog but because there was so little advancement during that time, it is done fairly quickly. As a reader with very limited knowledge of the history of medicine, I found this very interesting. What I didn't know at the beginning of the book was that the better part of the book was spent with the author going off on tangents only peripherally related to the pandemic. There is a great deal of information in this book, too much information. This book could have done with a good editor. The length of the book was about the same length as most of the books I read, and in many cases, much shorter but it didn't feel that way. It felt much longer. Barry's use of metaphor was helpful in explaining his subject and his style of writing wasn't awful as many reviewers have charged but he didn't seem to know when to stop on those threads that he followed out to what felt like oblivion at times. This is the first book I have read devoted to the subject (and may be the last). I could not recommend this book; at least not to anyone just interested in the pandemic. I can only suppose that there are better books on the topic."

113,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68316850-gavin,3,"Rousing history of one of the worst things that has ever happened: the 1918 outbreak of H1N1 flu. It focusses particularly on the great scientists who tried to fight it, none of whom I'd ever heard of. Also a meditation on epistemology, the modern mind, & the redemptive meaning of science for beasts like us.Barry senses that the headline result - one-third of the entire world infected, with 
25-100
 million dead - doesn't get enough of a rise from us. The numbers are numbing. So he couches it in modern shocking terms:
 It killed more people in twenty-four weeks than AIDS has killed in twenty-four years, more in a year than the Black Death killed in a century.
Or ten thousand 9/11s. It's worth belabouring this, because we have a weird habit of paying far more attention to human threats than natural ones, even when natural ones are far worse. (Witness our terrorism prevention budgets compared to our infectious disease control budgets, when the latter is a thousand times more lethal.)So: The 1918 flu was worse than the entire First World War: 40+ million died of flu compared with 17 million dead from war; 500 million lives damaged by flu vs 41 million lives by war. 3% of everyone alive died of flu, including about 8% of young adults(!).Except it's hard to separate the War and the pandemic. The virus was spread everywhere by unprecedented numbers of troops, and by the massive supply convoys it induced, and by the War's other human displacements. We don't know how many of the pneumonia deaths only occurred because of the logistical degradation, poverty and pestilence of wartime. There are terrible nonlinearities involved in overcrowding and global movement of troops. But add millions at least to the overall death toll caused by WWI.The book is in the epic mode, all the way through. (That's not a straightforward compliment.) I liked it, but I understand if it's a bit American for you:
Man might be defined as “modern” largely to the extent that he attempts to control nature. In this relationship with nature, modern humanity has generally been the aggressor, and a daring one at that, altering the flow of rivers, building upon geological faults, and, today, even engineering the genes of existing species. Nature has generally been languid in its response, although contentious once aroused and occasionally displaying a flair for violence.By 1918 humankind was fully modern, and fully scientific, but too busy fighting itself to aggress against nature. Nature, however, chooses its own moments. It chose this moment to aggress against man, and it did not do so prodding languidly. For the first time, modern humanity, a humanity practicing the modern scientific method, would confront nature in its fullest rage.
There's a long prelude describing how terrible medicine was up to the 20th Century. Medicine was ""the withered arm of science"". Therapeutic nihilism (that is, ""we can't really do anything"") was the only rational view, replacing millenia of Galenic woo.
Stengel reviewed dozens of ideas advanced in medical journals. Gargles of various disinfectants. Drugs. Immune sera. Typhoid vaccine. Diphtheria antitoxin. But Stengel’s message was simple: This doesn’t work. That doesn’t work. Nothing worked... Nothing they were doing worked.
Problem is, this rational scepticism created a powerful vacuum: humans need to believe something can heal, and the gap was filled with worse. Some confabulated gremlins from this time haunt us still: homeopathy, chiropractic, naturopathy, Christian Science, and (though Barry doesn't include them) the organic farming movement and psychoanalysis.Few people come off well. Even among the scientists, we get a horrible example of perverse priors and premature updating: an enormous proportion of all scientific resources were devoted to fighting the wrong pathogen, due to a bad guess by an extremely eminent researcher.Because so much of the state was occupied in war, in places there was wholesale social collapse:
In Philadelphia meanwhile fear came and stayed. Death could come from anyone, anytime. People moved away from others on the sidewalk, avoided conversation; if they did speak, they turned their faces away to avoid the other person’s breathing. The impossibility of getting help compounded the isolation. 850 Philadelphia doctors and more nurses were away in the military. More than that number were sick. Philadelphia General Hospital had 126 nurses. Despite all precautions, despite wearing surgical masks and gowns, eight doctors and fifty-four nurses—43 percent of the staff—themselves required hospitalization. Ten nurses at this single hospital died. The Board of Health pleaded for help from retired nurses and doctors if they remembered “even a little” of their profession.When a nurse or doctor or policeman did actually come, they wore their ghostly surgical masks, and people fled them. In every home where someone was ill, people wondered if the person would die. And someone was ill in every home...Starr went to Emergency Hospital #2 at Eighteenth and Cherry Streets. He did have help, if it could be called that, from an elderly physician who had not practiced in years and who brought Starr into touch with the worst of heroic medicine. Starr wouldn’t forget that, the ancient arts of purging, of venesection, the ancient art of opening a patient’s vein. But for the most part he and the other students elsewhere were on their own, with little help even from nurses, who were so desperately needed that in each of ten emergency hospitals supplied by the Red Cross only a single qualified nurse was available to oversee whatever women came as volunteers. And often the volunteers reported for their duty once and, from either fear or exhaustion, did not come again.Nearly 1/4 of all the patients in his hospital died each day. Starr would go home, and when he returned the next day, he would find that between one-quarter and one-fifth of the patients in the hospital had died, replaced by new ones... Virtually all of them, along with their friends and relatives, were terrified that, no matter how mild the symptoms seemed at first, within them moved an alien force, a seething, spreading infection, a live thing with a will that was taking over their bodies — and could be killing them...The city was frozen with fear, frozen into stillness. Starr lived 12 miles from the hospital. The streets were silent on his drive home, silent. They were so silent he took to counting the cars he saw. One night he saw no cars at all. He thought, “The life of the city had almost stopped.”
Everyone can read the collapse of official power in Philadelphia as supporting their politics. Anarchists can point to the benevolent spontaneous order that arose after the corrupt local government failed to act; libertarians can point out that this spontaneous order was all funded by the richest Philadelphians; statists can point out that, without actually-authoritative co-ordination, the effort eventually failed, because people defected against each other, in fear.
The corpses had backed up at undertakers’, filling every area of these establishments and pressing up into living quarters; in hospital morgues overflowing into corridors; in the city morgue overflowing into the street. And they had backed up in homes. They lay on porches, in closets, in corners of the floor, on beds. Children would sneak away from adults to stare at them, to touch them; a wife would lie next to a dead husband, unwilling to move him or leave him. The corpses, reminders of death and bringers of terror or grief, lay under ice at Indian-summer temperatures. Their presence was constant, a horror demoralizing the city; a horror that could not be escaped. Finally the city tried to catch up to them.The police wore their ghostly surgical masks, and people fled them, but the masks had no effect on the viruses and by mid-October thirty-three policemen had died, with many more to follow... More coffins came by rail, guarded by men with guns.
""There is, therefore, but one response possible from us: Force! force to the utmost, force without stint or limit, the righteous and triumphant force which shall make right the law of the world and cast every selfish dominion down in the dust. ""- Woodrow Wilson addressing one of his money-lending mobs.Wilson tends to be viewed pretty positively, just because he won. (""at last the world knows America as the savior of the world!"") But he perverted an entire state and nation to do so, ignored the terrible suffering of his own damn population for years, and refused a conditional peace with Austria in August and with the Kaiser's new parliament in September. (This meant 30-70 extra days of war, which, if this period was as lethal as the rest of the war, means up to 800,000 completely unnecessary deaths, not to mention the continuing waste of resources during the worst epidemic ever). Wilson did great evil, was not much different from the Kaiser, the election aside.
 the military suctioned more and more nurses and physicians into cantonments, aboard ships, into France, until it had extracted nearly all the best young physicians. Medical care for civilians deteriorated rapidly. The doctors who remained in civilian life were largely either incompetent young ones or those over forty-five years of age, the vast majority of whom had been trained in the old ways of medicine. 
Barry's middle chapters are a frightening portrait of how rabidly un-American the US was in 1918. The laws were bad enough - for instance the ban on criticising the government. But then there's the unofficial ""patriotic duties"", punishable by beatings. State-sponsored atavism.
By the summer of 1918, however, Wilson had injected the government into every facet of national life and had created great bureaucratic engines to focus all the nation’s attention and intent on the war.He had created a Food Administration to control and distribute food, a Fuel Administration to ration coal and gasoline, a War Industries Board to oversee the entire economy. He had taken all but physical control over the railroads and had created a federally sponsored river barge line that brought commerce back to life on the Mississippi River, a commerce that had been killed by competition from those railroads. He had built many dozens of military installations, each of which held at least tens of thousands of soldiers or sailors. He had created industries that made America’s shipyards teem with hundreds of thousands of laborers launching hundreds of ships, dug new coal mines to produce coal for the factories that weaned America’s military from British and French weapons and munitions—for, unlike in World War II, America was no arsenal of democracy.He had created a vast propaganda machine, an internal spy network, a bond-selling apparatus... He had even succeeded in stifling speech, in the summer of 1918 arresting and imprisoning — some for prison terms longer than ten years —not just radical labor leaders and editors of German-language newspapers but powerful men, even a congressman.He had injected the government into American life in ways unlike any other in the nation’s history. And the final extension of federal power had come only in the spring of 1918, after the first wave of influenza had begun jumping from camp to camp, when the government expanded the draft from males between the ages of twenty-one and thirty to those between the ages of eighteen and forty-five. Only on May 23, 1918, had Provost Marshal Enoch Crowder, who oversaw the draft, issued his “work or fight” order, stating that anyone not employed in an essential industry would be drafted...Crowder bragged about doing “in a day what the Prussian autocracy had been spending nearly fifty years to perfect...""In mid-August, as the lethal wave of the epidemic was gathering itself, Austria had already inquired about peace terms, an inquiry that Wilson rebuffed utterly. And as the epidemic was gathering full momentum, peace was only weeks away. Bulgaria had signed an armistice on September 29. On September 30, Kaiser Wilhelm had granted parliamentary government to the German nation; that same day Ludendorff had warned his government that Germany must extend peace feelers or disaster—immediate disaster—would follow. German diplomats sent out those feelers. Wilson ignored them. The Central Powers, Germany and her allies, were simultaneously breaking off one from one another and disintegrating internally as well. In the first week of October, Austria and Germany separately sent peace feelers to the Allies, and on October 7, Austria delivered a diplomatic note to Wilson formally seeking peace on any terms Wilson chose. Ten days later — days of battle and deaths — the Austrian note remained unanswered.Earlier Wilson had spoken of a “peace without victory,” believing only such a peace could last. But now he gave no indication that the war would soon be over. Although a rumor that the war had ended sent thrills through the nation, Wilson quickly renounced it. Nor would he relent. He was not now fighting to the death; he was fighting only to kill...If Wilson and his government would not be turned from his end even by the prospect of peace, they would hardly be turned by a virus. And the reluctance, inability, or outright refusal of the American government to shift targets would contribute to the killing. Wilson took no public note of the disease, and the thrust of the government was not diverted. The relief effort for influenza victims would find no assistance in the Food Administration or the Fuel Administration or the Railroad Administration. From neither the White House nor any other senior administration post would there come any leadership, any attempt to set priorities, any attempt to coordinate activities, any attempt to deliver resources....the military would give no help to civilians. Instead it would draw further upon civilian resources. The same day that Welch had stepped out of the autopsy room at Devens and called Gorgas’s office, his warning had been relayed to the army chief of staff, urging that all transfers be frozen unless absolutely necessary and that under no circumstances transfers from infected camps be made... Gorgas’s superiors ignored the warning. There was no interruption of movement between camps whatsoever; not until weeks later, with the camps paralyzed and, literally, tens of thousands of soldiers dead or dying, did the army make any adjustments.
Because the disease was everywhere, ravaging the entire species (and beyond), the book can't cover everything. Very little is said about non-Americans, i.e about 98% of the death and chaos. This is partly because there just isn't a lot of evidence about them, despite their influenza immunity and medical care being even worse. (This is why the top estimates reach 100m deaths, three times the median estimate.) Here is a passage about just a tiny number of them, in the north:
In Alaska, whites protected themselves. Sentries guarded all trails, and every person entering the city was quarantined for five days. Eskimos had no such luck. A senior Red Cross official warned that without “immediate medical assistance the race” could become “extinct.”...The navy provided the collier USS Brutus to carry a relief expedition... They found terrible things. One doctor visited ten tiny villages and found “three wiped out entirely; others average 85% deaths… Survivors generally children… probably 25% frozen to death before help arrived.”The virus probably did not kill all of them directly. But it struck so suddenly it left no one well enough to care for any others, no one to get food, no one to get water. And those who could have survived, surrounded by bodies, bodies of people they loved, might well have preferred to go where their family had gone, might well have wanted to no longer be alone... Two hundred sixty-six people had lived in Okak, and many dogs, dogs nearly wild. When the virus came, it struck so hard so fast people could not care for themselves or feed the dogs. The dogs grew hungry, crazed with hunger, devoured each other, then wildly smashed through windows and doors, and fed... In all of Labrador, at least one-third the total population died. 
---Barry commits at least one big error: he's horrified by the medical schools of the time having ""no standards for admission"":
 In research and education especially, American medicine lagged far behind [European medicine]... At least one hundred US medical schools would accept any man willing to pay tuition... and only a single medical school required its student to have a college degree... the Johns Hopkins itself, not student fees, paid [its] faculty salaries, and it required medical students to have not only a college degree but fluency in French and German and a background of science courses. 
But his enthusiasm for Johns Hopkins introducing the college degree requirement is misplaced. Contemporary US doctors (who all have 3 years of pre-med, or even more college, before they start medical training) are probably no better clinicians than undergraduate doctors in other countries, and are far further in debt. This requirement is probably one reason the American system is so fucked.I suppose Barry is just confusing the open admissions situation with the schools' appallingly low graduation standards, which is certainly one reason eC20th medicine sucked. (Many doctors had never looked down a microscope, never used a stethoscope on a patient, never seen a dissection.)---PS: Mostly unimportant corrections by a virologist here.

Bush read this book shortly after it was published and was so impressed by the threat of future pandemics that he commissioned a department whose sole function was to prepare for future pandemics. This involved cooperation by federal, state and international entities (such as the WHO) to set up surveillance networks for potentially deadly diseases and to stockpile drugs and equipment such as mechanical ventilators that could be used in the event of a sharp spike in the number of inpatient hospitalizations. Unfortunately, the current president quickly defunded and essentially disbanded all of President Bush's efforts to prepare for what scientists and even foresighted politicians knew was inevitable. In his book, Barry wrote of the things that people did to protect themselves in 1918-19 and recommendations for what we could do when the next pandemic occurred. There was actually very few differences between the two lists: masks, hand-washing, social distancing and the cancelling of large gatherings being prominent on both lists. Barry asserted that our greatest chance of preventing a full-scale calamity lay in forethought and preparation. We will never know if that would have had much of an impact. When Barry wrote this book he likely couldn't have foreseen the political situation the U.S. finds itself in today but he knew politicians. He knew that in order to avoid boosting the enemy's morale in wartime, our leaders refused to speak honestly about the seriousness of the influenza pandemic and, as a result, millions died. But if he thought that politicians today were any better, he likely wouldn't have written in the afterward of one edition ""On a larger scale, and far more difficult, will be getting governments to tell the truth about the disease. This is perhaps the biggest lesson about 1918 and it is a lesson not yet learned.""I try to avoid revealing spoilers in my reviews but these are unusual times and I think that the best way to close this review is to let Barry do it for me. Here are the closing paragraphs in this magnificent work:
So the final lesson of 1918, a simple one yet one most difficult to execute, is that those who occupy positions of authority must lessen the panic that can alienate all within a society. Society cannot function if it is every man for himself. By definition, civilization cannot survive that. Those in authority must retain the public’s trust. The way to do that is to distort nothing, to put the best face on nothing, to try to manipulate no one. Lincoln said that first, and best. A leader must make whatever horror exists concrete. Only then will people be able to break it apart.

116,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4739424-mal-warwick,5,"A century ago a pandemic disease far more lethal than COVID-19 killed an estimated fifty to one hundred million people around the world—as many as one out of every twenty people then alive. The 1918 flu epidemic erupted during a war that had already killed tens of millions and at a time when medical science was far less accomplished than it is today. Although there are lessons to learn for our response to COVID-19, it’s important to view what happened then in its historical context. And that’s the approach John M. Barry so brilliantly takes in The Great Influenza. This engrossing book may well be one of the very best ever written on medical history.The historical context of the 1918 flu epidemicAs Barry makes clear, medical science had taken big steps forward in the decades before the pandemic erupted, especially in the United States. Half a century earlier, German researchers, and French to a lesser extent, led the world in medical research. However, by the outbreak of World War I, two institutions had spearheaded immense advances in American medicine: Johns Hopkins Hospital and the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research (later Rockefeller University).Johns Hopkins Hospital, founded in 1889, had been established expressly to bring the scientific method into the teaching and practice of medicine in the United States. The Rockefeller Institute set out from day one to become the world’s most important medical research institution, and many observers have expressed the opinion that it succeeded very shortly after its establishment in 1901. Barry traces the evolution of both Johns Hopkins and the Rockefeller (as they were then known) through in-depth sketches of the prominent physicians who led them. Those doctors, the heroes of the tale, played leadership roles in combating the 1918 flu epidemic, advising the military and government at all levels on precautionary measures and researching the origins of the disease and possible treatment. Unfortunately, they made little headway in either respect.Why the disease spread so widely and so quicklyThe doctors’ increasingly strident insistence on warning the public about the epidemic were met with rigid resistance until hundreds of thousands of Americans had already died. The Wilson administration had instituted draconian measures to prevent any news from reaching the public that would turn its attention from the need to support the war effort. Although press censorship was not in force, the nation’s press almost uniformly self-censored, parroting the official line that the disease was not serious while bodies piled up in the morgues. The result then, as it is today in the COVID-19 pandemic, was that those who denied the problem lost the public’s trust. But the biggest reason the influenza spread so widely and so quickly was the insistence of the US Army on transferring troops in large numbers from one base to another in crowded trains and then overseas in crowded ships.The 1918 flu epidemic was “the deadliest pandemic in history”Although up to five percent of the world’s population—and “as many as 8 to 10 percent of all young adults then living—died from the so-called “Spanish influenza,” its impact was not limited to the appalling death toll. Naturally, the pandemic greatly influenced the course of medical research and the adoption of public health measures far more widely than had been the case. But its consequences were far-reaching both in the conduct of World War I and in the shape of the peace that emerged from the conflict. Barry skillfully explores both themes in The Great Influenza.How the epidemic helped defeat GermanyIn April 1918, German commander Erich Ludendorff began “his last great offensive—Germany’s last real chance to win the war. The . . . offensive made great initial gains.” But then it stalled. Barry quotes the diary of a US Army surgeon stationed near the front: “‘The expected third phase of the great German offensive gets put off from day to day . . . I gather that the epidemic of grippe which hit us rather hard in Flanders also hit the Boche worse, and this may have caused the delay.'” In fact, Ludendorff himself “blamed influenza for the loss of initiative and the ultimate failure of the offensive.” No single battle necessarily changes the course of any war (although Midway, Stalingrad, and the Normandy Invasion are all claimed to have done just that in the next war.) But contemporary observers in 1918, and military analysts now, seem to agree that however slim the likelihood that Germany might end up victorious was certainly then lost.How the 1918 flu epidemic helped cause World War IIHistorians agree that the Treaty of Versailles that brought World War I to a close was a disaster. The excessive pain it imposed on Germany is almost universally acknowledged to have led in virtually a straight line to the Second World War. Yet that treaty took the form it did only because, midway through the peace conference, the world’s most popular statesman, Woodrow Wilson, suddenly and unaccountably “abandoned principles he had previously insisted upon. He yielded to [French Prime Minister Georges] Clemenceau everything of significance Clemenceau wanted, virtually all of which Wilson had earlier opposed.” Clemenceau was the primary architect of the harsh provisions incorporated into the treaty.Most accounts of Wilson’s strange turnabout at Versailles ascribe it to a minor stroke he suffered. The President was, in fact, in his sickbed when he made the fateful decision. However, Barry cites powerful evidence that Wilson had not in fact suffered a stroke. He had the flu. “Wilson’s actual symptoms—including high fever, severe coughing, and total prostration, [were] all symptoms that perfectly fit influenza and have no association whatsoever with stroke . . . Indeed, the virus may have contributed to the [severe] stroke” Wilson suffered much later that incapacitated him and led to his death.Where the “Spanish flu” really originatedWithin months of its appearance in the United States, the 1918 flu epidemic quickly went pandemic throughout Western Europe. The “Great War” was in its final months at the time, and rigid press censorship was in force on both sides of the trenches. Thus, even though thousands of American, French, British, and German troops were falling ill throughout the war zone, no news about their plight reached the home front in any one of the combatant countries. Neutral Spain, however, was different. There, alarmist reports about the virulence of the fast-spreading disease were splashed all over front pages. And that was how the epidemic came to be dubbed the “Spanish flu.”In fact, as Barry reports in detail, the deadly strain of H1N1 influenza at the heart of the 1918 flu epidemic almost certainly originated in Haskell County, Kansas, early that year. From there, the disease made its way eastward to a huge army “cantonment” where tens of thousands of troops were preparing to be shipped to France as cannon fodder for “Black Jack” Pershing‘s push against the German lines. Tens of thousands never made it there, falling victim instead to the flu. And, in carrying the disease to Europe, they triggered its spread to both Allied and enemy troops as well as civilian populations throughout Western Europe and ultimately to the rest of the world.How the 1918 flu epidemic was different from COVID-19In two major respects, the pandemic of a century ago differed significantly from what we are experiencing as I write:** Influenza is a respiratory disease that primarily attacks the lungs, nose, and throat. When it kills, it does so primarily through pneumonia. Although COVID-19 was initially feared to be similar in its effects, it is in truth a vascular disease that manifests through the circulatory system. ** It’s difficult for scientists to calculate the mortality (death) rate of a disease. But it is clear that the H1N1 influenza virus that emerged in 1918 was far more lethal than the COVID-19 strains that have been seen to date. Hundreds of thousands are dying today. Eventually, it seems likely that globally millions will do so. But it seems highly unlikely that the death toll will rise into the tens of millions as was the case a century ago.However, there is one significant way in which the two pandemics are similar. History tends to refer to the earlier pandemic as the “1918 flu epidemic,” suggesting that a first, relatively mild strain broke out in the spring of that year, followed by a second, far more lethal strain in the fall. In fact, though, the second wave lasted until 1919—and there was a third wave in 1920. Medical researchers tell us that COVID-19 is almost certain to behave in a similar fashion. As I write, we are experiencing either the first or the second wave of the disease (the experts differ). Yet another outbreak seems certain, with or without the speedy development of a vaccine—polyannish predictions to the contrary notwithstanding."

Outside of these few very well-known accounts, there is almost nothing in literature about it afterwards. They write about horrors that people inflict on people. Apparently they forget the horrors that nature inflicts on people, the horrors that make humans least significant. And yet the pandemic resonated.” Times like these only help us get perspective, Human race suffers from Amnesia and keeps forgetting the one and biggest truth of all. As Nietzsche's said - ""In some remote corner of the universe, poured out and glittering in innumerable solar systems, there once was a star on which clever animals invented knowledge. That was the highest and most mendacious minute of ""world history""—yet only a minute. After nature had drawn a few breaths the star grew cold, and the clever animals had to die."" We are nothing but a speck of dust in the grand scheme of things and times like these keep reminding us that. But times likes also explain why we are most thriving species on the earth today. We have invented these abstract concepts of ""Love"" , ""Compassion"" and ""Hope"" and that's what defines us. At the end this will be over I hope we are able to learn something out of this. This is an amazing read in my mind. The book not just telling the story of the pandemic but the foundations of the medical science in America. The author has done an amazing job covering different aspect of those times and I can certainly draw similarities in the current ongoing situations. It has definitely given me perspective.

The early history of the practice medicine in this country and lack of training of the doctors was jaw dropping.

""In view of the comparatively short time during which most of the student-soldiers will remain in college and the exacting military duties awaiting them, academic instruction must necessarily be modified along the lines of direct military value.""I appreciated the great detail used in explaining the scientific rigor in trying to understand the disease that was plaguing the country and world. All the dead ends and false leads with persistent desperate scientists trying to find the answers in the midst of horror.""These things become easy to discern in hindsight.

I don't know if it's poorly-written or poorly-edited, but there were places were the same thing was said within pages of each other. And boring?!? Honestly, I was looking for a book about the flu to read during flu-season (especially in the year I decided NOT to get the flu shot), and all we get is lengthy biographies about the doctors and people who... well, I'm not even sure how most of them are important to the story. Really, when you pick up a book about a deadly disease you want to read about the deadly disease, and not wait for a couple hundred pages for it to appear or get good. The book is going back on the shelf but I guess I'll leave my bookmark where it is, just in case I get really bored."
120,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72479728-bryan-alkire,3,"Turned out to be ok, but given my high expectations for the book, ultimately disappointing. Before I get talk about the book itself, I’d like to say a few words about the peril of popular historical analogy. Really, this current Corona virus and the 1918 flu are not equivalent. Different diseases different times different responses. For starters, 1918 was a war economy. If people had chirped about lack of toilet paper or individual rights to be out and about, they would have been swiftly muzzled. Second, the government involvement at the federal level was vastly different. In 1918 the federal government did absolutely nothing, tot even brave words of comfort, for civilians suffers the flu. Today the government is throwing massive amounts of money at the problem even if it is at the behest of business special interests. At least the government is trying something. In fact, the only thing similar is that local governments are bearing the brunt of the response and that said response is a patchwork and that the media is following local government lead, in 1918 largely silent about the danger, in 2020 loudly proclaiming from the rooftops about the dangers. The last difference is the most important, different diseases. The 1918 flu struck quickly with a 48 to 72-hour incubation period and often killed suddenly as short as 12 hours after symptoms largely because the body’s immune system had to mount such a vigorous defense that if killed the body in the process. This corona virus is a two-week incubation period and seems to be more of a slow and more predictable killer.  Hopefully you’re still reading at this point as I will now discuss the book. I like books on pandemics when I can find them. They’re interesting and often draw lessons, usually for apocalypse writers, but unfortunately, real life currently. I chose this book because it’s the popular definitive work on the 1918 flu and that’s where the book falls short. The The organization of this book is just bad. It’s a confusing narrative structure with no real timeline and constant doubling back and forth interspersed with chapters on diseases and the like. It’s extremely repetitive. The writing is uneven. Sometimes it slows admirably and at other times gets bogged down in statistics and detail. The book also becomes awfully dry at times, particularly when discussing diseases themselves in quite detailed fashion. The content is also uneven. There’s lots here which isn’t truly relevant like medical school history and the life stories of doctors whose insolvent with the flu was more administrate than actual work. In short, this book was just a mess and clearly there was no good editing done on it. This book could have been a lot better than it was. So, I give this a 3. It’s interesting and at times, quite readable and even compelling. But, it’s dismally organized and edited. It could have been much better. "
121,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12087691-wendyb,5," A must-read book for the times we live in.Starts out with maybe just a little too much background on some of the doctors involved in the 1918 flu research but still interesting info on the state of medicine at that time.Got really interesting with the info on the start of the flu and the effect on the population.In researching my family background, I discovered my grandparents' first child died in Oct 1918 of the Spanish Flu at just 12 days old. So in some small ways, this history still touches us today."

Unlike most influenza, this one targeted young people in their 20s and 30s. Although it's called the Spanish flu because the Spanish press had extensive coverage of the disease, it's thought to have originated in Kansas. Soldiers carried the disease as they traveled between crowded military facilities, then crossed the Atlantic on crowded boats to fight in World War I.Author John M. Barry also writes about the advances in medical education and medical research in the United States which occurred just before the pandemic. The Johns Hopkins Medical School and the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research were highlighted. He goes into great detail describing the lives and work of the medical researchers. While the pandemic was raging, researchers were not able to identify the viral pathogen, and many thought that the bacteria causing secondary infections was responsible. The book contains excellent descriptions of how a virus attacks human cells and replicates in the body. The mutation of viruses and the development of vaccines are also discussed.Barry also writes about the way politics and misinformation from public officials exacerbated the pandemic of 1918. Although the book was written in 2004, it has warnings that are important today during the COVID crisis. This timely book is interesting and well researched, although some readers may find there is too much detail about the medical schools and researchers."
123,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2190636-joselito-honestly-and-brilliantly,5,"The 1918 Flu Pandemic coincided with the First World War and it killed more than both the military and civilian casualties of the conflict yet while the war generated an avalanche of literature (poems, songs, music, fiction, films, biographies and autobiographies) not much serious work had been done about this pandemic until this book published in 2004.I read this a few years back and I’ve disposed of my copy already but since it was a gripping, unforgettable read, I could still recall some tidbits of information about this 1918 pandemic in relation with what we are now experiencing during the present one.First of all, and this is what is often found to be the most surprising about whatever virus was it which caused the 1918 pandemic, the most vulnerable was those who were physically fit and at the prime of their lives (think those in their 20’s or 30’s who eat healthy and go to the gym). Contrast this with with most of the present Covid 19 fatalities who are old and who had pre-existing health issues. But why is that? For some reasons, the body’s immune system or antibodies react to the 1918 virus in a weird way. They overreact or overdo things. The analogy is that when a fly (the virus) enters a house (the human body) someone drops an atom bomb (the antibodies) on it to kill the fly and because of it even the house is completely destroyed. So that is why it was the healthy and the strong who mostly died: they were the ones with stronger antibodies.Secondly, the incubation period for the 1918 virus was apparently shorter. I think there was a story in the book about someone talking gaily on a street, apparently healthy, then in just an hour or so would die there in that same place. Or a bus of healthy-looking people stopping before it reaches its destination because its driver (with 6 of its passengers) dropping dead.The 1918 pandemic killed about 100 Million people worldwide. No one knew how it was stopped. Probably it just got tired of killing people."

There were three waves in the pandemic, the second wave the worst. In US, the condition in East Coast was worse than the west coast. San Francisco managed relatively well among big cities in US. Scientists did not find out the pathogen until many years later. The genome of the virus was sequenced in 2005.What strikes me most is that how the US politics today regarding Covid-19 has much in common with what happened in the 1918-1919 pandemic.

I thought this was going to read like a thriller by Michael Crichton or Dan Brown following a plucky single doctor who fights hard for his patients, makes a breakthrough, and saves the day. That's not this book because that's definitely not what happened. The book starts off with a history of medicine. I had a vague idea about this beginning with Hypocrites and then jumping to those bleeders in Period dramas that announce, ""He's not long for this world."" with much in between. But there wasn't much in between and that's the problem.    While the other sciences moved in leaps and bounds medicine did not. There were lightbulbs and trains and the doctor was still coming to bleed you. Barry gives two reasons for this stagnation. The first is the anathema of autopsy. For the longest time it was simply unthinkable to cut into and examine a human being, it was too close to butchers work. Then there was a religious stigma attached but even in the twentieth century the liberal gods spoke out against it. Hell, even today hardened cops don't like attending autopsies.The second reason is a little trickier to understand - medicine is not logical like the other sciences. Barry gives an excellent example. A doctor in the early 1900s noticed that the face flushed during fever so he reasoned that fever could be a capillary issue. To test his theory he bled his fever patients. They went pale, their temperature dropped, and they were ravenous for food and drink. A cure! He published his finding, which was easily replicated, and was much lauded by the medical community. It was perfectly logical. It was wrong. Due to this reputation for butchery, witchery, and general ineffectiveness, being a doctor was not a respected profession. Medical schools were shockingly bad pass/fail systems where teacher salaries were based on butts in seats. Things changed quickly when they changed and you'll have to read the book to find out. This was the first book I read in 2016 and here I sit on the last evening of the year trying to finish this review. It was not mere procrastination; I was daunted by how much I enjoyed, learned, and was affected by this book. I became a vegetarian for four months and switched out all my beauty products to the more expensive cruelty free lines. And that was not even the point of the book. This entire review and I haven't even mentioned the word flu. Sigh. Just read it. *special thanks to my 2015 Secret Santa Krystal!"
129,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1649751-florence,4,"This is a very frightening book. We usually consider the flu to be a non life threatening disease. Not true in 1918. The disease killed millions in a worldwide pandemic. The actual number of fatalities can never be known because medical systems were so overwhelmed that many people were dying at home without ever seeing a medical professional. The grisly details of how ordinary people suffered are in this comprehensive book. Also covered are scientific descriptions of bacteria and viruses that a reader without a scientific background can comprehend. The pandemic seemed to be a perfect storm. President Woodrow Wilson was myopically focused on victory overseas as the Great War raged on. He made a fateful decision to send ailing troops to Europe, disregarding the advice of military health experts, exponentially expanding the disease to Europe. It took over 20 years to identify the virus that causes influenza. Initially it is transferred from an animal and has the diabolic ability to rapidly mutate to a form that can be spread among humans. Can a pandemic of this scope occur again? Almost certainly."
130,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/241691-kay,3,"""One always tends to overpraise a long book because one has got through it."" – E.M. ForsterIt took me the better part of the summer to listen to this audiobook in my car (I don't drive that much) -- and I confess that it soon became more of a chore than a pleasure. I do wish there had been a competently edited abridged version, for if ever a book cried out for editing, it was this one. Some of the book's strengths, however, include the exhaustive account of how the pandemic started and spread, not to mention the effect it had on society. There was a huge amount of material on how the authorities (mostly didn't) deal with the crisis, one of the key themes of the book being that in order to deal with such a threat that the civil authorities need to be completely honest about it. Point taken, but it was repeated over and over and over.... as were the somewhat melodramatic accounts of how the bodies stacked up, what having the disease was like, what the death toll was, and so on and so forth. Another strength was the intimate portraits of key researchers who rushed to find the cause of -- and a vaccine for -- the particularly virulent strain of influenza. There was a problem, though, in that the book's entire first section was a somewhat tedious historical account of the Johns Hopkins Institute. I'm still not sure why that was necessary (and suspect it wasn't). Granted, it was good to know what the state of medicine was at the turn of the century, but such an overview certainly could have been done more concisely. I also had real issues with the way several medical researchers, and in particular Paul Lewis, were cast into ""roles"" -- with Lewis the tragic figure that the author claimed was ""the last victim"" of the pandemic. Humph!However, I did find it fascinating to read about the details and design of medical research, and in particular how viruses mutated and became more or less deadly. In fact, I wished for a bit more of that information and less of the endless parade of statistics that Barry seemed so inordinately fond of. I came to believe that he had never met a statistic he didn't like (or subsequently use). Again, I was puzzled about why the editors hadn't intervened and winnowed out the repetitious material. Scott Brick, the reader for this book, was one of the biggest irritants, however, and no doubt significantly contributed to my feeling that the book was NEVER going to end. While his voice wasn't an unpleasant one, he seemed to have a very narrow ""range"" of intonation and emphasis. In fact, it sounded like he was overemphasizing just about everything, and he had a particular way of lingering over and stressing the word ""any"" that made me want to shriek after the first few hours. I had a hard time separating my irritation with his reading from my general impatience with the book, which is probably the reason I gave this three stars rather than two -- I'm not entirely sure whose fault it was that I didn't find this as interesting as I'd expected. (Plus, as Forster noted, one DOES tend to overpraise a long book that one finally manages to finish.) If I'd been reading this book rather than listening to it, undoubtedly I would have been able to skim pretty efficiently, slowing down for the parts that interested me the most and just skipping over the repetitive bits. But as a ""captive"" listener, it was pretty tough going. "
131,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/541670-caroline,2,"I had no less than four people come up to me while I was reading this book and tell me how great it was. Apparently it also made quite a splash at USAID when it was published. Maybe that's why three out of the four people who approached me were coworkers.It's possible these endorsements gave me unrealistic expectations, because by the time I finished it I was practically pulling my hair out. Which is a bummer because I was super excited to read The Great Influenza. I love books about medicine and medical history, so it wasn't the subject, it was what story author John Barry chose (tried?) to tell.An anecdote: Occasionally in high school, I would hit a particularly difficult calculus problem and seek out my mechanical engineer father for help. I'd show him the problem, perhaps a particularly pernicious related rate problem. Instead of starting from the problem itself, my dad always wanted to make sure I understood all of the individual concepts required to complete it. The running joke is that if I came to him with a calculus problem, he'd start no later in the material than the formal definition of a derivative and go from there. It would take several chapters worth of content before we arrived at the actual matter at hand. I still enjoy ribbing my dad about his approach to calculus assistance. He's sitting across the room from me right now and when I told him what I was writing he just grinned and declared ""First principles! You must build block by block on first principles!"" Hello, Dad who I've exaggerated for comedic effect, meet John M. Barry.John Barry started this book with Hippocrates and Galen. He then spent 166 pages getting from ancient Greece to the scientific revolution in American medicine that occurred in the early 20th century. He provides painstaking detail surrounding the creation of Johns Hopkins University (to be fair, this was pretty interesting, it's just... not the 1918 influenza pandemic). He introduces a small army of doctors, bacteriologists, and medical researchers, all of whom played a role in dragging medicine into the 20th century via the scientific method.Then, we have a mighty record scratch and Barry decides to spend about 200 pages on the 1918 epidemic itself. The majority of individuals introduced in the first section of the book take a backseat to an almost mind-numbing number of U.S. military cantonments, local and national politicians, and morbidity and mortality statistics. The level of detail is overwhelming and largely made my eyes glaze over. Frustratingly, this part of the book felt almost entirely disconnected from the medical history discussed earlier. Due to the severity of the pandemic, the carefully laboratory work according to the scientific method had to be discarded for shortcuts and best guesses. I figured Barry would highlight this irony and while he mentioned it a time or two, he for the most part just kept barreling forward through the history.Record scratch number two. With the end of the pandemic, we return to a smaller subset of the cast of characters discussed prior to its arrival and follow their lives and research down a number of paths that are only tangentially related (if at all) to influenza. Many of the most important individuals from the first part of the book are discarded without providing any sort of conclusion to their story.The whole thing was immensely aggravating. Whenever I look at a marble sculptures in art museums, I marvel at the fact that a sculptor was able to look at a block of stone, see the figure within, and get rid of the extra to reveal what was there all along. The Great Influenza felt like John M. Barry looking at a block of marble, seeing David, sculpting away, and instead revealing a figure with six arms, two heads, and feet erupting Alien-like from its chest. There are probably two and a half good books contained within, but Barry couldn't see what to get rid of and editor Wendy Wolf certainly didn't take a firm enough hand. I'm genuinely alarmed at the thought of what this book looked like pre-editor after reading the bloated and muddled final result. Here's the kicker: in the acknowledgements, John Barry pulls back the curtain on the process of writing the book and fully reveals his obliviousness. Get a load of this:""This book was initially supposed to be a straightforward story of the deadliest epidemic in human history, told from the perspectives of both scientists who tried to fight it and political leaders who tried to respond to it. I though it would take me two and a half years to write, three at the most. That plan didn't work. Instead this book took seven years to write. It has evolved (and, I hope, grown) into something rather different than originally conceived.""NO JOHN, THE NEW PLAN PLAN DIDN'T WORK. YOU SHOULD HAVE STUCK WITH THE ORIGINAL. Seven years. Holy crud.Other nits to pick: I often felt like Barry had an agenda to push. At various times in the book, he would stake out rather extreme positions and seemed to only approach the history from that angle, with Wilson's approach to World War I and the U.S. military's approach to the pandemic being two of the major examples. Were either perfect? Certainly not, but Barry seemed almost to cast them as the villains of the influenza pandemic, a practice I found unhelpful. I was also distinctly uncomfortable with an insinuation Barry made about the death of Paul A. Lewis. Implying suicide shouldn't be thrown around without evidence, and Barry provided nothing concrete. Not cool, dude.The writing is also nothing to write home about. Barry has an annoying habit of repeating anecdotes throughout the book and if I see the sentence ""It was influenza, only influenza"" one more time, I might scream.It's probably 1.5 stars but I'm rounding up. So why two instead of one? I did learn some things and a number of individual threads in the book were interesting. Highlights include a better understanding of why Johns Hopkins has the reputation it does, what the Hs and Ns are in influenza (ex: the H1N1 strain), and the word enzootic*.In all honesty, though, I'd probably pass on this one. You can learn the bulk of the 1918 influenza-specific stuff more quickly and enjoyably via Wikipedia. *It is to animals what the word ""epidemic"" is to humans, which makes sense given the roots. I'm distinctly less excited about it now, though, having just looked up the pronunciation and realized that it is pronounced en-zoh-AH-tic instead of en-ZOO-tic. I suppose you can't win them all."
132,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3244513-mike,4,"Overall this was a very good book. Expansive, thorough, and at times utterly fascinating. I'm sure people around me are completely sick of me talking about the flu at this point but this is that kind of book that will do that to you. It falls short of getting five stars for a couple of reasons, some of which are about the book but most of which are about me as a reader:1. It's almost too expansive: In Barry's quest to explore every possible nook and cranny of the 1918 Influenza pandemic he leaves no scientific idea or historical actor unearthed and thoroughly discussed. This lends to a skater shot feel to the book as you lurch from one person to another in chronological order with whole chapters about the science of viruses and bacteria popping up here and there to interrupt the forward momentum of the story. I feel like I got a about a dozen very short, somewhat shallow, biographies in this one book and a bit more science that I really wanted. 2. Lack of a supporting personal story or strong main character: When I contrast this book with Steven Johnson's ""Ghost Map"", which is all about John Snow and how he dealt with a cholera outbreak in London in the 19th Century, I find that it didn't hold my attention all the time because I didn't really connect with any of the people in the book or feel like there was a broad narrative that was pulling me along. Sure, he does a good job of showing how the pandemic began, how it peaks, and how it ebbs but the pandemic is far too amorphous for me to really relate to. And while he clearly shows how many of the people in the book react at these different phases I didn't really feel like I got to know any of them with the kind of detail that Johnson pulled out of John Snow.3. Hey, you got your science book in my history book! No, you got your history book in my science book! Wow, they're two great genres that kind of make for a confusing mess when you put them all together: Okay, this gripe is all about me as a reader. I'm WAY more interested in history and politics than science. Unless the science is about robots, zombies, or space ships at a certain point I kind of just zone out. Barry, at times, gets super deep on the science of influenza explaining in great detail how it infects the body and causes no end of problems. While it is a great feat of writing to talk about that sort of thing without losing the reader (to his credit it was never confusing) it doesn't make for a compelling read for me. When Barry talks about history in this book it's completely riveting, I literally couldn't put it down, but then there would be a speed bump science chapter and I'd have to slog through it to get back to the ideas that were the most interesting to me. It made for a frustrating read at times.Over all I would highly recommend this book. It really was quite good, my gripes aside. And, frankly, the historical implications of the book make it worth the read alone (namely that at a crucial junction in the negotiation of the Treaty of Versailles at the end of World War I Pres. Wilson came down with the flu and it, for a bunch of reasons, left him possibly permanently mentally impaired - he believed from that point on that French spies had infiltrated the White House for example - is shocking. Given that that treaty is often held directly responsible for the rise of Nazi Germany, and World War II, and that the principle features of that treaty may have caused the rise of the Nazi's were almost all pushed by the French and opposed by Pres. Wison, until his bought with the flu that is, one is left believing if not for the flu the world could have been very different). If you like science and enjoy history I think this would be a very satisfying reading experience.As an aside, I gave this book to my Grandmother for Christmas in 2009 when she was 91 years old. She and I developed a pattern late in her life of me giving her books that I'd read that I liked for birthdays and Christmas. She was an avid reader and game to read anything, although like me her preferences were more inclined to history, biography, and travel. This was one of the rare books I gave her without reading first. When I asked her, on Christmas 2011, to lend me one of her favorite books she gave me this one. She was born in April of 1918, near the beginning of this book, and I think for her the book explained a lot of things people would mention in her childhood that never made much sense (relatives who died during the flu, particular idioms people would use, or beliefs they had about sickness). She died in March of 2012 just a month shy of 94. In reading this book I am profoundly impressed by her intelligence. This book is not an easy read in spots (there were sections I read twice) and for someone who didn't even finish high school to read this book and not only understand it but enjoy it is a testament to the amazing person she was. This book still has the post-it note she always put on the inside front cover of books she got as gifts with the date, occasion, and person(s) who gave it to her. While she may be gone it makes me happy that she and I could at least share this one last experience together. "
133,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/82228946-nightlights,5,"Thought about giving this book four stars for minor repetition but last few chapters, and the afterword was so profound that it made everything even out.Early in the chapters, a mini-memoir of prominent scientists felt a bit excessive. But once you finish this book, a different perspective arises. The sacrifice Paul Lewis made just broke my heart. 🥺😞 (((Stay Safe Everyone)))"
134,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1923002-mara,3,"Read it for a biotech class in college and really enjoyed it- I mean, it shined pretty brightly compared to my biochem textbook"
135,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/611813-melinda,4,"Re-reading again in 2020 in the middle of the coronavirus outbreak.This is an excellent book. Reading it in the time of Coronavirus is eye-opening. I wish that the shrill shrieking gerbils of the media would provide comparisons ""per population"" for their numbers, and also comparisons with the traditional flu. The 2nd half of the book is especially worthwhile in this time of pandemic.********I highly recommend this book! It reads like a ""who-done-it"", except that you know who did it (the influenza virus) and you are watching the medical scientists struggle to find solutions while the wild-fire of the 1918 influenza pandemic raged all around them. Will they find a solution in time? (see the bottom paragraph for an answer to this question)Before documenting the path of the 1918 influenza, the author lays the groundwork for the transformed medical atmosphere from the late 1800's into the early 1900's in America. This path thus shows the beginnings of the the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research, the Phipps Institute, and Johns Hopkins University. Names of medical pioneers and influenza warriors such as Paul Lewis (who proved that polio was caused by a virus in 1907 and developed a vaccine that was 100% effective in protecting monkeys), William Henry Welch (the single most powerful individual in the history of American medicine, who directed the rise of Johns Hopkins University, and who with John D. Rockefeller Jr. created the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research, arguablly the best scientific research institute in the world), Simon Flexner (first head of the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research, the man who brought the mortality rate for common bacterial meningitis down to 18% in 1919 WITHOUT antibiotics!), Rufus Cole (who made the Rockefeller Institute Hospital a model for the way clinical research is conducted), Army Surgeon General William Gorgas (whose work in abating the transmission of yellow fever and malaria by controlling the mosquitos saved hundreds of thousands of lives, and allowed construction on the Panama Canal), Oswald Avery (whose work on influenza would lead him to one of the most important scientific discoveries in the 20th century, that DNA is the material of which genes and chromosomes are made), Anna Wessel Williams (the leading female bacteriologist in the world who worked hand in hand with William Park trying to develop a serum or vaccine for influenza),William Park (teamed with Anna Wessel Williams, developed the diptheria antitoxin still in use today), andRichard Shope (who as the first to prove that a virus caused influenza) fill the pages of this book. After setting the stage with its influenza warriors and medical laboratories, the author then begins the saga of the influenza virus itself. Influenza struck in the first wave in the winter and spring of 1918, a mild ""three day fever"" form that most recovered from. The second wave hit in the fall of 1918. This wave was the most virulent and deadly. The third wave hit somewhere in the winter / spring of 1919, and was once again a less virulent form. In just 2 years the virus mutated into a super killer, then back into a more mild disease. In raw numbers, the lowest estimate of the worldwide death toll at the time was 20 million. Knowing what we know now, epidemiologists today estimate that influenza caused at least 50 million and possibly 100 million deaths worldwide. All that in a time when the population of the world was 1/3rd of what it is today. The terrifying aspect of the super killer influenza was that it did not strike the traditional victims... the old and the very young, but instead hit hardest in the age group of 20's and 30's. If the upper estimate of 100 million deaths is accurate, then 8 to 10 percent of all young adults then living were killed by the virus.And these deaths happened with blinding speed. The influenza pandemic stretched out over 2 years. But 2/3rds of the deaths occurred in a period of 24 weeks. That is about 66 million deaths in 24 weeks. Averaged out that would be 2.5 million deaths per week. Yet more than half of those 66 million deaths happened from mid-September to early December of 1918. That is really 33 million deaths in 10 to 12 weeks! That's 3.3 MILLION deaths PER WEEK in the late fall and early winter of 1918! And remember that the world population at the time was less than 1/3rd of what it is today (which is 6.8 billion people). The numbers are just staggering, and I had to keep reading them and figuring out the numbers and it still is a staggering thought. So many died in so short a time! Epidemiological evidence from the work of Dr. Loring Miner seems to show that the new influenza virus originated in Haskell County, Kansas early in the winter of 1918. Dr. Miner documented early cases of the new influenza that showed disturbing mortality rates in a very short period of time. The virus then went to a huge army base in the eastern part of the state as troops were gathered in preparation for their deployment to Europe for WWI. From that army base, soliders were sent to France, soldiers were transferred to other bases in the United States....and the disease began sweeping through North America, Europe, South America, Asia, Africa, and the entire world. Some situations requiring fast decision making in chaotic circumstances were carried out well. Other situations were not handled as well. The ins and outs of these crossing paths of decisions, deaths mounting rapidly, politics, mililtary directives, and newly formed medical laboratories make up the rest of the book. The story is staggering, but gripping. In answer to the question at the beginning of this review, the answer is ""no, the medical scientists did not find a solution during the time of the 1918 thru 1920 influenza pandemic"". They learned alot, yes. They also learned that the only way to be protected from the disease was through isolation from it. Medical practices helping and treating the ill were improved, but a vaccine was never been found. The only reason the killing influenza stopped killing was because it mutated away from the more virulent form into a milder form. So the question immediately to ask is ""what happens if the virus mutates back to the virulent form?"". And that is the question we are left with at the end of the book. In the concluding chapter, the author raises these issues and concludes tentatively that in pandemic times, an authorized power (government, World Health Organization, army, someone) must have the authority to act and to act quickly, and their decisions must trump individual freedoms. Mandatory vaccinations, mandatory quaranatine, mandatory travel restrictions are the things that must be done to protect the larger population. The ""needs of the many outweigh the needs of the one"", if I may quote a Star Trek movie. In times of such overwhelming medical need, quick decisions must be made and sometimes they must be harsh."
136,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2201886-mike,4,"[Since that book deals with epidemic disease, also. In the present there is a virulent influenza outbreak and in the past there is the plague sweeping through England. This book deals with the deadliest outbreak of virulent influenza so far which, at the time, was often thought to be a form of plague (because of extreme cyanosis). Neat, tie-in huh? (hide spoiler)]"
137,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4118002-jeanne,4,"The Great Influenza is a sobering story, especially in today’s climate. This well-researched book gives a detailed account of why this deadly pandemic devastated the world. A well-written history."
138,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10978428-jim,4,"The bodies were piling up. The undertakers, themselves falling sick, were overwhelmed. There was no place to put the bodies. Gravediggers were either sick or refused to bury the influenza victims. Caskets were stacking up...then they ran short of caskets. The city morgue filled up. The stench was terrible...this was Philadelphia, October 1918, the time of the so-called ""Spanish flu."" Barry gives us a panoramic view of the most lethal influenza outbreak in history which occurred in 1918-1919. Today we believe that the death toll in the United States was 675,000 out of a population of 105 million. As many as 100 million died worldwide out of a global population of 1.8 billion, more than 5% of the world's population.  Barry follows the movement of the flu virus across the world, starting in rural Kansas, where somehow the virus crossed the animal-human barrier (from chickens?). It erupted in an Army camp in Kansas and moved east with the soldiers and then went on the troopships with them to Europe...It came in three waves, that first wave that hit the soldiers in the spring of 1918 was rather mild. But then in the fall, there was the second wave that was much more virulent--that's when most of the deaths occurred. Then the virus mutated again and there was a third wave which hit places like Australia--which had not been hit so hard by the second wave. Much of the book is involved with the story of the scientists battling the virus. Barry goes into some detail about this and focuses on some key figures. As he explains, a revolution had occurred in American medicine where labs had been organized and work was going on with the expectation that disease could be conquered by modern science. When it came to the great influenza, science failed. We are still living with the consequences of that.  The book was published in 2004 and, in it, Barry warns that we will face another pandemic. It's only a question of when. He states that we are NOT prepared for a pandemic. The events of this year of 2020 shows that he was right."
139,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6949571-thomas-paul,5,"It killed more people in 6 months than the Black Death killed in a century. People who were young and strong were the most likely to die. In the US, 650,000 people died. The average life expectancy in the US went down by 10 years. Worldwide, perhaps 100 million people died. And yet, it was only the flu. Even today, 90 years after the epidemic, it kills 36,000 Americans in a typical year and we are hardly more prepared to face another epidemic.John M. Barry has written a fascinating account of the influenza epidemic of 1918. But the book is a lot more than just a review of the flu. Barry starts out by examining the state of the American health system at the time of the epidemic and how it reached that state. He explores the revolutionary changes to medicine that occurred in the late 19th and early 20th century and the people who led those changes. He shows us why, even today, a cure for influenza is beyond our reach, explaining in layman’s terms how the influenza virus changes to become deadly and changes again to lose that deadliness. He explains how an endemic virus can lead to an epidemic of unimagined proportions.Barry also shows how the demands of World War I on troop movements, the propaganda campaigns to keep morale high, and the failure of leaders to listen to the doctors and researchers led to a killing field of historic size. His account tends to concentrate on Philadelphia because the city was hit extremely hard and much of the research going on was near that city but he does cover other areas around the world hit hard by the virus, although his coverage of the flu outside of the US is sketchy at best. He gives us writings from diaries and newspaper articles to show what was actually happening and how the media tried to downplay the epidemic. He gives us detailed accounts of the research (and the researchers) that was done to fight the epidemic, explains why this research was mostly unsuccessful, and does it all in a way that is easy to understand even if you don’t have a medical degree.Barry likes to use foreshadowing, hints of what is to come, to keep the reader’s interest and it does work, even if it is a bit melodramatic. Even the chapter titles, “The Tinderbox”, “It Begins”, The Race”, provide some melodrama to the story. The book mostly moves at a good pace and I found myself having trouble putting it down. Barry has written a book that everyone should read, whether you are familiar with the epidemic or not. It is a fascinating, terrifying, detailed, and extremely important book."
140,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8298053-colleen-browne,3,"This book starts out with a summary of medicine from Hippocrates to the First World War. That seems like it would be a long slog but because there was so little advancement during that time, it is done fairly quickly. As a reader with very limited knowledge of the history of medicine, I found this very interesting. What I didn't know at the beginning of the book was that the better part of the book was spent with the author going off on tangents only peripherally related to the pandemic. There is a great deal of information in this book, too much information. This book could have done with a good editor. The length of the book was about the same length as most of the books I read, and in many cases, much shorter but it didn't feel that way. It felt much longer. Barry's use of metaphor was helpful in explaining his subject and his style of writing wasn't awful as many reviewers have charged but he didn't seem to know when to stop on those threads that he followed out to what felt like oblivion at times. This is the first book I have read devoted to the subject (and may be the last). I could not recommend this book; at least not to anyone just interested in the pandemic. I can only suppose that there are better books on the topic."

It focusses particularly on the great scientists who tried to fight it, none of whom I'd ever heard of. Also a meditation on epistemology, the modern mind, & the redemptive meaning of science for beasts like us.Barry senses that the headline result - one-third of the entire world infected, with 
25-100
 million dead - doesn't get enough of a rise from us. The numbers are numbing. So he couches it in modern shocking terms:
 It killed more people in twenty-four weeks than AIDS has killed in twenty-four years, more in a year than the Black Death killed in a century.
Or ten thousand 9/11s. It's worth belabouring this, because we have a weird habit of paying far more attention to human threats than natural ones, even when natural ones are far worse. (Witness our terrorism prevention budgets compared to our infectious disease control budgets, when the latter is a thousand times more lethal.)So: The 1918 flu was worse than the entire First World War: 40+ million died of flu compared with 17 million dead from war; 500 million lives damaged by flu vs 41 million lives by war. 3% of everyone alive died of flu, including about 8% of young adults(!).Except it's hard to separate the War and the pandemic. The virus was spread everywhere by unprecedented numbers of troops, and by the massive supply convoys it induced, and by the War's other human displacements. We don't know how many of the pneumonia deaths only occurred because of the logistical degradation, poverty and pestilence of wartime. There are terrible nonlinearities involved in overcrowding and global movement of troops. But add millions at least to the overall death toll caused by WWI.The book is in the epic mode, all the way through. (That's not a straightforward compliment.) I liked it, but I understand if it's a bit American for you:
Man might be defined as “modern” largely to the extent that he attempts to control nature. In this relationship with nature, modern humanity has generally been the aggressor, and a daring one at that, altering the flow of rivers, building upon geological faults, and, today, even engineering the genes of existing species. Nature has generally been languid in its response, although contentious once aroused and occasionally displaying a flair for violence.By 1918 humankind was fully modern, and fully scientific, but too busy fighting itself to aggress against nature. Nature, however, chooses its own moments. It chose this moment to aggress against man, and it did not do so prodding languidly. For the first time, modern humanity, a humanity practicing the modern scientific method, would confront nature in its fullest rage.
There's a long prelude describing how terrible medicine was up to the 20th Century. Medicine was ""the withered arm of science"". Therapeutic nihilism (that is, ""we can't really do anything"") was the only rational view, replacing millenia of Galenic woo.
Stengel reviewed dozens of ideas advanced in medical journals. Gargles of various disinfectants. Drugs. Immune sera. Typhoid vaccine. Diphtheria antitoxin. But Stengel’s message was simple: This doesn’t work. That doesn’t work. Nothing worked... Nothing they were doing worked.
Problem is, this rational scepticism created a powerful vacuum: humans need to believe something can heal, and the gap was filled with worse. Some confabulated gremlins from this time haunt us still: homeopathy, chiropractic, naturopathy, Christian Science, and (though Barry doesn't include them) the organic farming movement and psychoanalysis.Few people come off well. Even among the scientists, we get a horrible example of perverse priors and premature updating: an enormous proportion of all scientific resources were devoted to fighting the wrong pathogen, due to a bad guess by an extremely eminent researcher.Because so much of the state was occupied in war, in places there was wholesale social collapse:
In Philadelphia meanwhile fear came and stayed. Death could come from anyone, anytime. People moved away from others on the sidewalk, avoided conversation; if they did speak, they turned their faces away to avoid the other person’s breathing. The impossibility of getting help compounded the isolation. 850 Philadelphia doctors and more nurses were away in the military. More than that number were sick. Philadelphia General Hospital had 126 nurses. Despite all precautions, despite wearing surgical masks and gowns, eight doctors and fifty-four nurses—43 percent of the staff—themselves required hospitalization. Ten nurses at this single hospital died. The Board of Health pleaded for help from retired nurses and doctors if they remembered “even a little” of their profession.When a nurse or doctor or policeman did actually come, they wore their ghostly surgical masks, and people fled them. In every home where someone was ill, people wondered if the person would die. And someone was ill in every home...Starr went to Emergency Hospital #2 at Eighteenth and Cherry Streets. He did have help, if it could be called that, from an elderly physician who had not practiced in years and who brought Starr into touch with the worst of heroic medicine. Starr wouldn’t forget that, the ancient arts of purging, of venesection, the ancient art of opening a patient’s vein. But for the most part he and the other students elsewhere were on their own, with little help even from nurses, who were so desperately needed that in each of ten emergency hospitals supplied by the Red Cross only a single qualified nurse was available to oversee whatever women came as volunteers. And often the volunteers reported for their duty once and, from either fear or exhaustion, did not come again.Nearly 1/4 of all the patients in his hospital died each day. Starr would go home, and when he returned the next day, he would find that between one-quarter and one-fifth of the patients in the hospital had died, replaced by new ones... Virtually all of them, along with their friends and relatives, were terrified that, no matter how mild the symptoms seemed at first, within them moved an alien force, a seething, spreading infection, a live thing with a will that was taking over their bodies — and could be killing them...The city was frozen with fear, frozen into stillness. Starr lived 12 miles from the hospital. The streets were silent on his drive home, silent. They were so silent he took to counting the cars he saw. One night he saw no cars at all. He thought, “The life of the city had almost stopped.”
Everyone can read the collapse of official power in Philadelphia as supporting their politics. Anarchists can point to the benevolent spontaneous order that arose after the corrupt local government failed to act; libertarians can point out that this spontaneous order was all funded by the richest Philadelphians; statists can point out that, without actually-authoritative co-ordination, the effort eventually failed, because people defected against each other, in fear.
The corpses had backed up at undertakers’, filling every area of these establishments and pressing up into living quarters; in hospital morgues overflowing into corridors; in the city morgue overflowing into the street. And they had backed up in homes. They lay on porches, in closets, in corners of the floor, on beds. Children would sneak away from adults to stare at them, to touch them; a wife would lie next to a dead husband, unwilling to move him or leave him. The corpses, reminders of death and bringers of terror or grief, lay under ice at Indian-summer temperatures. Their presence was constant, a horror demoralizing the city; a horror that could not be escaped. Finally the city tried to catch up to them.The police wore their ghostly surgical masks, and people fled them, but the masks had no effect on the viruses and by mid-October thirty-three policemen had died, with many more to follow... More coffins came by rail, guarded by men with guns.
""There is, therefore, but one response possible from us: Force! force to the utmost, force without stint or limit, the righteous and triumphant force which shall make right the law of the world and cast every selfish dominion down in the dust. ""- Woodrow Wilson addressing one of his money-lending mobs.Wilson tends to be viewed pretty positively, just because he won. (""at last the world knows America as the savior of the world!"") But he perverted an entire state and nation to do so, ignored the terrible suffering of his own damn population for years, and refused a conditional peace with Austria in August and with the Kaiser's new parliament in September. (This meant 30-70 extra days of war, which, if this period was as lethal as the rest of the war, means up to 800,000 completely unnecessary deaths, not to mention the continuing waste of resources during the worst epidemic ever). Wilson did great evil, was not much different from the Kaiser, the election aside.
 the military suctioned more and more nurses and physicians into cantonments, aboard ships, into France, until it had extracted nearly all the best young physicians. Medical care for civilians deteriorated rapidly. The doctors who remained in civilian life were largely either incompetent young ones or those over forty-five years of age, the vast majority of whom had been trained in the old ways of medicine. 
Barry's middle chapters are a frightening portrait of how rabidly un-American the US was in 1918. The laws were bad enough - for instance the ban on criticising the government. But then there's the unofficial ""patriotic duties"", punishable by beatings. State-sponsored atavism.
By the summer of 1918, however, Wilson had injected the government into every facet of national life and had created great bureaucratic engines to focus all the nation’s attention and intent on the war.He had created a Food Administration to control and distribute food, a Fuel Administration to ration coal and gasoline, a War Industries Board to oversee the entire economy. He had taken all but physical control over the railroads and had created a federally sponsored river barge line that brought commerce back to life on the Mississippi River, a commerce that had been killed by competition from those railroads. He had built many dozens of military installations, each of which held at least tens of thousands of soldiers or sailors. He had created industries that made America’s shipyards teem with hundreds of thousands of laborers launching hundreds of ships, dug new coal mines to produce coal for the factories that weaned America’s military from British and French weapons and munitions—for, unlike in World War II, America was no arsenal of democracy.He had created a vast propaganda machine, an internal spy network, a bond-selling apparatus... He had even succeeded in stifling speech, in the summer of 1918 arresting and imprisoning — some for prison terms longer than ten years —not just radical labor leaders and editors of German-language newspapers but powerful men, even a congressman.He had injected the government into American life in ways unlike any other in the nation’s history. And the final extension of federal power had come only in the spring of 1918, after the first wave of influenza had begun jumping from camp to camp, when the government expanded the draft from males between the ages of twenty-one and thirty to those between the ages of eighteen and forty-five. Only on May 23, 1918, had Provost Marshal Enoch Crowder, who oversaw the draft, issued his “work or fight” order, stating that anyone not employed in an essential industry would be drafted...Crowder bragged about doing “in a day what the Prussian autocracy had been spending nearly fifty years to perfect...""In mid-August, as the lethal wave of the epidemic was gathering itself, Austria had already inquired about peace terms, an inquiry that Wilson rebuffed utterly. And as the epidemic was gathering full momentum, peace was only weeks away. Bulgaria had signed an armistice on September 29. On September 30, Kaiser Wilhelm had granted parliamentary government to the German nation; that same day Ludendorff had warned his government that Germany must extend peace feelers or disaster—immediate disaster—would follow. German diplomats sent out those feelers. Wilson ignored them. The Central Powers, Germany and her allies, were simultaneously breaking off one from one another and disintegrating internally as well. In the first week of October, Austria and Germany separately sent peace feelers to the Allies, and on October 7, Austria delivered a diplomatic note to Wilson formally seeking peace on any terms Wilson chose. Ten days later — days of battle and deaths — the Austrian note remained unanswered.Earlier Wilson had spoken of a “peace without victory,” believing only such a peace could last. But now he gave no indication that the war would soon be over. Although a rumor that the war had ended sent thrills through the nation, Wilson quickly renounced it. Nor would he relent. He was not now fighting to the death; he was fighting only to kill...If Wilson and his government would not be turned from his end even by the prospect of peace, they would hardly be turned by a virus. And the reluctance, inability, or outright refusal of the American government to shift targets would contribute to the killing. Wilson took no public note of the disease, and the thrust of the government was not diverted. The relief effort for influenza victims would find no assistance in the Food Administration or the Fuel Administration or the Railroad Administration. From neither the White House nor any other senior administration post would there come any leadership, any attempt to set priorities, any attempt to coordinate activities, any attempt to deliver resources....the military would give no help to civilians. Instead it would draw further upon civilian resources. The same day that Welch had stepped out of the autopsy room at Devens and called Gorgas’s office, his warning had been relayed to the army chief of staff, urging that all transfers be frozen unless absolutely necessary and that under no circumstances transfers from infected camps be made... Gorgas’s superiors ignored the warning. There was no interruption of movement between camps whatsoever; not until weeks later, with the camps paralyzed and, literally, tens of thousands of soldiers dead or dying, did the army make any adjustments.
Because the disease was everywhere, ravaging the entire species (and beyond), the book can't cover everything. Very little is said about non-Americans, i.e about 98% of the death and chaos. This is partly because there just isn't a lot of evidence about them, despite their influenza immunity and medical care being even worse. (This is why the top estimates reach 100m deaths, three times the median estimate.) Here is a passage about just a tiny number of them, in the north:
In Alaska, whites protected themselves. Sentries guarded all trails, and every person entering the city was quarantined for five days. Eskimos had no such luck. A senior Red Cross official warned that without “immediate medical assistance the race” could become “extinct.”...The navy provided the collier USS Brutus to carry a relief expedition... They found terrible things. One doctor visited ten tiny villages and found “three wiped out entirely; others average 85% deaths… Survivors generally children… probably 25% frozen to death before help arrived.”The virus probably did not kill all of them directly. But it struck so suddenly it left no one well enough to care for any others, no one to get food, no one to get water. And those who could have survived, surrounded by bodies, bodies of people they loved, might well have preferred to go where their family had gone, might well have wanted to no longer be alone... Two hundred sixty-six people had lived in Okak, and many dogs, dogs nearly wild. When the virus came, it struck so hard so fast people could not care for themselves or feed the dogs. The dogs grew hungry, crazed with hunger, devoured each other, then wildly smashed through windows and doors, and fed... In all of Labrador, at least one-third the total population died. 
---Barry commits at least one big error: he's horrified by the medical schools of the time having ""no standards for admission"":
 In research and education especially, American medicine lagged far behind [European medicine]... At least one hundred US medical schools would accept any man willing to pay tuition... and only a single medical school required its student to have a college degree... the Johns Hopkins itself, not student fees, paid [its] faculty salaries, and it required medical students to have not only a college degree but fluency in French and German and a background of science courses. 
But his enthusiasm for Johns Hopkins introducing the college degree requirement is misplaced. Contemporary US doctors (who all have 3 years of pre-med, or even more college, before they start medical training) are probably no better clinicians than undergraduate doctors in other countries, and are far further in debt. This requirement is probably one reason the American system is so fucked.I suppose Barry is just confusing the open admissions situation with the schools' appallingly low graduation standards, which is certainly one reason eC20th medicine sucked. (Many doctors had never looked down a microscope, never used a stethoscope on a patient, never seen a dissection.)---PS: Mostly unimportant corrections by a virologist here. Reply to these from Barry here."
144,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22063432-tom-mathews,5,"The old adage that 'those who fail to learn from the past are condemned to repeat it' has never been so true. President George W. Bush read this book shortly after it was published and was so impressed by the threat of future pandemics that he commissioned a department whose sole function was to prepare for future pandemics. This involved cooperation by federal, state and international entities (such as the WHO) to set up surveillance networks for potentially deadly diseases and to stockpile drugs and equipment such as mechanical ventilators that could be used in the event of a sharp spike in the number of inpatient hospitalizations. Unfortunately, the current president quickly defunded and essentially disbanded all of President Bush's efforts to prepare for what scientists and even foresighted politicians knew was inevitable. In his book, Barry wrote of the things that people did to protect themselves in 1918-19 and recommendations for what we could do when the next pandemic occurred. There was actually very few differences between the two lists: masks, hand-washing, social distancing and the cancelling of large gatherings being prominent on both lists. Barry asserted that our greatest chance of preventing a full-scale calamity lay in forethought and preparation. We will never know if that would have had much of an impact. When Barry wrote this book he likely couldn't have foreseen the political situation the U.S. finds itself in today but he knew politicians. He knew that in order to avoid boosting the enemy's morale in wartime, our leaders refused to speak honestly about the seriousness of the influenza pandemic and, as a result, millions died. But if he thought that politicians today were any better, he likely wouldn't have written in the afterward of one edition ""On a larger scale, and far more difficult, will be getting governments to tell the truth about the disease. This is perhaps the biggest lesson about 1918 and it is a lesson not yet learned.""I try to avoid revealing spoilers in my reviews but these are unusual times and I think that the best way to close this review is to let Barry do it for me. Here are the closing paragraphs in this magnificent work:
So the final lesson of 1918, a simple one yet one most difficult to execute, is that those who occupy positions of authority must lessen the panic that can alienate all within a society. Society cannot function if it is every man for himself. By definition, civilization cannot survive that. Those in authority must retain the public’s trust. The way to do that is to distort nothing, to put the best face on nothing, to try to manipulate no one. Lincoln said that first, and best. A leader must make whatever horror exists concrete. Only then will people be able to break it apart.

146,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4739424-mal-warwick,5,"A century ago a pandemic disease far more lethal than COVID-19 killed an estimated fifty to one hundred million people around the world—as many as one out of every twenty people then alive. The 1918 flu epidemic erupted during a war that had already killed tens of millions and at a time when medical science was far less accomplished than it is today. Although there are lessons to learn for our response to COVID-19, it’s important to view what happened then in its historical context. And that’s the approach John M. Barry so brilliantly takes in The Great Influenza. This engrossing book may well be one of the very best ever written on medical history.The historical context of the 1918 flu epidemicAs Barry makes clear, medical science had taken big steps forward in the decades before the pandemic erupted, especially in the United States. Half a century earlier, German researchers, and French to a lesser extent, led the world in medical research. However, by the outbreak of World War I, two institutions had spearheaded immense advances in American medicine: Johns Hopkins Hospital and the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research (later Rockefeller University).Johns Hopkins Hospital, founded in 1889, had been established expressly to bring the scientific method into the teaching and practice of medicine in the United States. The Rockefeller Institute set out from day one to become the world’s most important medical research institution, and many observers have expressed the opinion that it succeeded very shortly after its establishment in 1901. Barry traces the evolution of both Johns Hopkins and the Rockefeller (as they were then known) through in-depth sketches of the prominent physicians who led them. Those doctors, the heroes of the tale, played leadership roles in combating the 1918 flu epidemic, advising the military and government at all levels on precautionary measures and researching the origins of the disease and possible treatment. Unfortunately, they made little headway in either respect.Why the disease spread so widely and so quicklyThe doctors’ increasingly strident insistence on warning the public about the epidemic were met with rigid resistance until hundreds of thousands of Americans had already died. The Wilson administration had instituted draconian measures to prevent any news from reaching the public that would turn its attention from the need to support the war effort. Although press censorship was not in force, the nation’s press almost uniformly self-censored, parroting the official line that the disease was not serious while bodies piled up in the morgues. The result then, as it is today in the COVID-19 pandemic, was that those who denied the problem lost the public’s trust. But the biggest reason the influenza spread so widely and so quickly was the insistence of the US Army on transferring troops in large numbers from one base to another in crowded trains and then overseas in crowded ships.The 1918 flu epidemic was “the deadliest pandemic in history”Although up to five percent of the world’s population—and “as many as 8 to 10 percent of all young adults then living—died from the so-called “Spanish influenza,” its impact was not limited to the appalling death toll. Naturally, the pandemic greatly influenced the course of medical research and the adoption of public health measures far more widely than had been the case. But its consequences were far-reaching both in the conduct of World War I and in the shape of the peace that emerged from the conflict. Barry skillfully explores both themes in The Great Influenza.How the epidemic helped defeat GermanyIn April 1918, German commander Erich Ludendorff began “his last great offensive—Germany’s last real chance to win the war. The . . . offensive made great initial gains.” But then it stalled. Barry quotes the diary of a US Army surgeon stationed near the front: “‘The expected third phase of the great German offensive gets put off from day to day . . . I gather that the epidemic of grippe which hit us rather hard in Flanders also hit the Boche worse, and this may have caused the delay.'” In fact, Ludendorff himself “blamed influenza for the loss of initiative and the ultimate failure of the offensive.” No single battle necessarily changes the course of any war (although Midway, Stalingrad, and the Normandy Invasion are all claimed to have done just that in the next war.) But contemporary observers in 1918, and military analysts now, seem to agree that however slim the likelihood that Germany might end up victorious was certainly then lost.How the 1918 flu epidemic helped cause World War IIHistorians agree that the Treaty of Versailles that brought World War I to a close was a disaster. The excessive pain it imposed on Germany is almost universally acknowledged to have led in virtually a straight line to the Second World War. Yet that treaty took the form it did only because, midway through the peace conference, the world’s most popular statesman, Woodrow Wilson, suddenly and unaccountably “abandoned principles he had previously insisted upon. He yielded to [French Prime Minister Georges] Clemenceau everything of significance Clemenceau wanted, virtually all of which Wilson had earlier opposed.” Clemenceau was the primary architect of the harsh provisions incorporated into the treaty.Most accounts of Wilson’s strange turnabout at Versailles ascribe it to a minor stroke he suffered. The President was, in fact, in his sickbed when he made the fateful decision. However, Barry cites powerful evidence that Wilson had not in fact suffered a stroke. He had the flu. “Wilson’s actual symptoms—including high fever, severe coughing, and total prostration, [were] all symptoms that perfectly fit influenza and have no association whatsoever with stroke . . . Indeed, the virus may have contributed to the [severe] stroke” Wilson suffered much later that incapacitated him and led to his death.Where the “Spanish flu” really originatedWithin months of its appearance in the United States, the 1918 flu epidemic quickly went pandemic throughout Western Europe. The “Great War” was in its final months at the time, and rigid press censorship was in force on both sides of the trenches. Thus, even though thousands of American, French, British, and German troops were falling ill throughout the war zone, no news about their plight reached the home front in any one of the combatant countries. Neutral Spain, however, was different. There, alarmist reports about the virulence of the fast-spreading disease were splashed all over front pages. And that was how the epidemic came to be dubbed the “Spanish flu.”In fact, as Barry reports in detail, the deadly strain of H1N1 influenza at the heart of the 1918 flu epidemic almost certainly originated in Haskell County, Kansas, early that year. From there, the disease made its way eastward to a huge army “cantonment” where tens of thousands of troops were preparing to be shipped to France as cannon fodder for “Black Jack” Pershing‘s push against the German lines. Tens of thousands never made it there, falling victim instead to the flu. And, in carrying the disease to Europe, they triggered its spread to both Allied and enemy troops as well as civilian populations throughout Western Europe and ultimately to the rest of the world.How the 1918 flu epidemic was different from COVID-19In two major respects, the pandemic of a century ago differed significantly from what we are experiencing as I write:** Influenza is a respiratory disease that primarily attacks the lungs, nose, and throat. When it kills, it does so primarily through pneumonia. Although COVID-19 was initially feared to be similar in its effects, it is in truth a vascular disease that manifests through the circulatory system. ** It’s difficult for scientists to calculate the mortality (death) rate of a disease. But it is clear that the H1N1 influenza virus that emerged in 1918 was far more lethal than the COVID-19 strains that have been seen to date. Hundreds of thousands are dying today. Eventually, it seems likely that globally millions will do so. But it seems highly unlikely that the death toll will rise into the tens of millions as was the case a century ago.However, there is one significant way in which the two pandemics are similar. History tends to refer to the earlier pandemic as the “1918 flu epidemic,” suggesting that a first, relatively mild strain broke out in the spring of that year, followed by a second, far more lethal strain in the fall. In fact, though, the second wave lasted until 1919—and there was a third wave in 1920. Medical researchers tell us that COVID-19 is almost certain to behave in a similar fashion. As I write, we are experiencing either the first or the second wave of the disease (the experts differ). Yet another outbreak seems certain, with or without the speedy development of a vaccine—polyannish predictions to the contrary notwithstanding."

Outside of these few very well-known accounts, there is almost nothing in literature about it afterwards. They write about horrors that people inflict on people. Apparently they forget the horrors that nature inflicts on people, the horrors that make humans least significant. And yet the pandemic resonated.” Times like these only help us get perspective, Human race suffers from Amnesia and keeps forgetting the one and biggest truth of all. As Nietzsche's said - ""In some remote corner of the universe, poured out and glittering in innumerable solar systems, there once was a star on which clever animals invented knowledge. That was the highest and most mendacious minute of ""world history""—yet only a minute. After nature had drawn a few breaths the star grew cold, and the clever animals had to die."" We are nothing but a speck of dust in the grand scheme of things and times like these keep reminding us that. But times likes also explain why we are most thriving species on the earth today.

Really, when you pick up a book about a deadly disease you want to read about the deadly disease, and not wait for a couple hundred pages for it to appear or get good.

150,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72479728-bryan-alkire,3,"Turned out to be ok, but given my high expectations for the book, ultimately disappointing. Before I get talk about the book itself, I’d like to say a few words about the peril of popular historical analogy. Really, this current Corona virus and the 1918 flu are not equivalent. Different diseases different times different responses. For starters, 1918 was a war economy. If people had chirped about lack of toilet paper or individual rights to be out and about, they would have been swiftly muzzled. Second, the government involvement at the federal level was vastly different. In 1918 the federal government did absolutely nothing, tot even brave words of comfort, for civilians suffers the flu. Today the government is throwing massive amounts of money at the problem even if it is at the behest of business special interests. At least the government is trying something. In fact, the only thing similar is that local governments are bearing the brunt of the response and that said response is a patchwork and that the media is following local government lead, in 1918 largely silent about the danger, in 2020 loudly proclaiming from the rooftops about the dangers. The last difference is the most important, different diseases. The 1918 flu struck quickly with a 48 to 72-hour incubation period and often killed suddenly as short as 12 hours after symptoms largely because the body’s immune system had to mount such a vigorous defense that if killed the body in the process. This corona virus is a two-week incubation period and seems to be more of a slow and more predictable killer.  Hopefully you’re still reading at this point as I will now discuss the book. I like books on pandemics when I can find them. They’re interesting and often draw lessons, usually for apocalypse writers, but unfortunately, real life currently. I chose this book because it’s the popular definitive work on the 1918 flu and that’s where the book falls short. The The organization of this book is just bad. It’s a confusing narrative structure with no real timeline and constant doubling back and forth interspersed with chapters on diseases and the like. It’s extremely repetitive. The writing is uneven. Sometimes it slows admirably and at other times gets bogged down in statistics and detail. The book also becomes awfully dry at times, particularly when discussing diseases themselves in quite detailed fashion. The content is also uneven. There’s lots here which isn’t truly relevant like medical school history and the life stories of doctors whose insolvent with the flu was more administrate than actual work. In short, this book was just a mess and clearly there was no good editing done on it. This book could have been a lot better than it was. So, I give this a 3. It’s interesting and at times, quite readable and even compelling. But, it’s dismally organized and edited. It could have been much better. "

So in some small ways, this history still touches us today."
152,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5364077-connie-g,4,"The great influenza pandemic of 1918-1920 killed between 20 to 100 million people worldwide, more fatalities than any other pandemic in history. Unlike most influenza, this one targeted young people in their 20s and 30s. Although it's called the Spanish flu because the Spanish press had extensive coverage of the disease, it's thought to have originated in Kansas. Soldiers carried the disease as they traveled between crowded military facilities, then crossed the Atlantic on crowded boats to fight in World War I.Author John M. Barry also writes about the advances in medical education and medical research in the United States which occurred just before the pandemic. The Johns Hopkins Medical School and the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research were highlighted. He goes into great detail describing the lives and work of the medical researchers. While the pandemic was raging, researchers were not able to identify the viral pathogen, and many thought that the bacteria causing secondary infections was responsible. The book contains excellent descriptions of how a virus attacks human cells and replicates in the body. The mutation of viruses and the development of vaccines are also discussed.Barry also writes about the way politics and misinformation from public officials exacerbated the pandemic of 1918. Although the book was written in 2004, it has warnings that are important today during the COVID crisis. This timely book is interesting and well researched, although some readers may find there is too much detail about the medical schools and researchers."
153,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2190636-joselito-honestly-and-brilliantly,5,"The 1918 Flu Pandemic coincided with the First World War and it killed more than both the military and civilian casualties of the conflict yet while the war generated an avalanche of literature (poems, songs, music, fiction, films, biographies and autobiographies) not much serious work had been done about this pandemic until this book published in 2004.I read this a few years back and I’ve disposed of my copy already but since it was a gripping, unforgettable read, I could still recall some tidbits of information about this 1918 pandemic in relation with what we are now experiencing during the present one.First of all, and this is what is often found to be the most surprising about whatever virus was it which caused the 1918 pandemic, the most vulnerable was those who were physically fit and at the prime of their lives (think those in their 20’s or 30’s who eat healthy and go to the gym). Contrast this with with most of the present Covid 19 fatalities who are old and who had pre-existing health issues. But why is that? For some reasons, the body’s immune system or antibodies react to the 1918 virus in a weird way. They overreact or overdo things. The analogy is that when a fly (the virus) enters a house (the human body) someone drops an atom bomb (the antibodies) on it to kill the fly and because of it even the house is completely destroyed. So that is why it was the healthy and the strong who mostly died: they were the ones with stronger antibodies.Secondly, the incubation period for the 1918 virus was apparently shorter. I think there was a story in the book about someone talking gaily on a street, apparently healthy, then in just an hour or so would die there in that same place. Or a bus of healthy-looking people stopping before it reaches its destination because its driver (with 6 of its passengers) dropping dead.The 1918 pandemic killed about 100 Million people worldwide. No one knew how it was stopped. Probably it just got tired of killing people."

The book is very dry to read. The writing is repetitive and it drags on and on. Part 1 is the development of American medical science (public health study, John Hopkins Medical School etc...). Part 2 is mostly US politics (Woodrow Wilson, WWI and how wartime censorship was implemented). The rest is about the pandemic. The book should be better titled as ""The Great Influenza and How the US Dealt With It"", because it covers only a little outside the United States.At least 50m people (5% world population) had been wiped out by the pandemic, which is equivalent to 390m people today. There were three waves in the pandemic, the second wave the worst. In US, the condition in East Coast was worse than the west coast. San Francisco managed relatively well among big cities in US. Scientists did not find out the pathogen until many years later. The genome of the virus was sequenced in 2005.What strikes me most is that how the US politics today regarding Covid-19 has much in common with what happened in the 1918-1919 pandemic.

158,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35645863-lena,5,"Beyond five stars. How many books are entertaining, important, engaging and edifying? I can only think of one, this one.  I thought this was going to read like a thriller by Michael Crichton or Dan Brown following a plucky single doctor who fights hard for his patients, makes a breakthrough, and saves the day. That's not this book because that's definitely not what happened. The book starts off with a history of medicine. I had a vague idea about this beginning with Hypocrites and then jumping to those bleeders in Period dramas that announce, ""He's not long for this world."" with much in between. But there wasn't much in between and that's the problem.    While the other sciences moved in leaps and bounds medicine did not. There were lightbulbs and trains and the doctor was still coming to bleed you. Barry gives two reasons for this stagnation. The first is the anathema of autopsy. For the longest time it was simply unthinkable to cut into and examine a human being, it was too close to butchers work. Then there was a religious stigma attached but even in the twentieth century the liberal gods spoke out against it. Hell, even today hardened cops don't like attending autopsies.The second reason is a little trickier to understand - medicine is not logical like the other sciences. Barry gives an excellent example. A doctor in the early 1900s noticed that the face flushed during fever so he reasoned that fever could be a capillary issue. To test his theory he bled his fever patients. They went pale, their temperature dropped, and they were ravenous for food and drink. A cure! He published his finding, which was easily replicated, and was much lauded by the medical community. It was perfectly logical. It was wrong. Due to this reputation for butchery, witchery, and general ineffectiveness, being a doctor was not a respected profession. Medical schools were shockingly bad pass/fail systems where teacher salaries were based on butts in seats. Things changed quickly when they changed and you'll have to read the book to find out. This was the first book I read in 2016 and here I sit on the last evening of the year trying to finish this review. It was not mere procrastination; I was daunted by how much I enjoyed, learned, and was affected by this book. I became a vegetarian for four months and switched out all my beauty products to the more expensive cruelty free lines. And that was not even the point of the book. This entire review and I haven't even mentioned the word flu. Sigh. Just read it. *special thanks to my 2015 Secret Santa Krystal!"
159,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1649751-florence,4,"This is a very frightening book. We usually consider the flu to be a non life threatening disease. Not true in 1918. The disease killed millions in a worldwide pandemic. The actual number of fatalities can never be known because medical systems were so overwhelmed that many people were dying at home without ever seeing a medical professional. The grisly details of how ordinary people suffered are in this comprehensive book. Also covered are scientific descriptions of bacteria and viruses that a reader without a scientific background can comprehend. The pandemic seemed to be a perfect storm. President Woodrow Wilson was myopically focused on victory overseas as the Great War raged on. He made a fateful decision to send ailing troops to Europe, disregarding the advice of military health experts, exponentially expanding the disease to Europe. It took over 20 years to identify the virus that causes influenza. Initially it is transferred from an animal and has the diabolic ability to rapidly mutate to a form that can be spread among humans. Can a pandemic of this scope occur again? Almost certainly."
160,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/241691-kay,3,"""One always tends to overpraise a long book because one has got through it."" – E.M. ForsterIt took me the better part of the summer to listen to this audiobook in my car (I don't drive that much) -- and I confess that it soon became more of a chore than a pleasure. I do wish there had been a competently edited abridged version, for if ever a book cried out for editing, it was this one. Some of the book's strengths, however, include the exhaustive account of how the pandemic started and spread, not to mention the effect it had on society. There was a huge amount of material on how the authorities (mostly didn't) deal with the crisis, one of the key themes of the book being that in order to deal with such a threat that the civil authorities need to be completely honest about it. Point taken, but it was repeated over and over and over.... as were the somewhat melodramatic accounts of how the bodies stacked up, what having the disease was like, what the death toll was, and so on and so forth. Another strength was the intimate portraits of key researchers who rushed to find the cause of -- and a vaccine for -- the particularly virulent strain of influenza. There was a problem, though, in that the book's entire first section was a somewhat tedious historical account of the Johns Hopkins Institute. I'm still not sure why that was necessary (and suspect it wasn't). Granted, it was good to know what the state of medicine was at the turn of the century, but such an overview certainly could have been done more concisely. I also had real issues with the way several medical researchers, and in particular Paul Lewis, were cast into ""roles"" -- with Lewis the tragic figure that the author claimed was ""the last victim"" of the pandemic. Humph!However, I did find it fascinating to read about the details and design of medical research, and in particular how viruses mutated and became more or less deadly. In fact, I wished for a bit more of that information and less of the endless parade of statistics that Barry seemed so inordinately fond of. I came to believe that he had never met a statistic he didn't like (or subsequently use). Again, I was puzzled about why the editors hadn't intervened and winnowed out the repetitious material. Scott Brick, the reader for this book, was one of the biggest irritants, however, and no doubt significantly contributed to my feeling that the book was NEVER going to end. While his voice wasn't an unpleasant one, he seemed to have a very narrow ""range"" of intonation and emphasis. In fact, it sounded like he was overemphasizing just about everything, and he had a particular way of lingering over and stressing the word ""any"" that made me want to shriek after the first few hours. I had a hard time separating my irritation with his reading from my general impatience with the book, which is probably the reason I gave this three stars rather than two -- I'm not entirely sure whose fault it was that I didn't find this as interesting as I'd expected. (Plus, as Forster noted, one DOES tend to overpraise a long book that one finally manages to finish.) If I'd been reading this book rather than listening to it, undoubtedly I would have been able to skim pretty efficiently, slowing down for the parts that interested me the most and just skipping over the repetitive bits. But as a ""captive"" listener, it was pretty tough going. "
161,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/541670-caroline,2,"I had no less than four people come up to me while I was reading this book and tell me how great it was. Apparently it also made quite a splash at USAID when it was published. Maybe that's why three out of the four people who approached me were coworkers.It's possible these endorsements gave me unrealistic expectations, because by the time I finished it I was practically pulling my hair out. Which is a bummer because I was super excited to read The Great Influenza. I love books about medicine and medical history, so it wasn't the subject, it was what story author John Barry chose (tried?) to tell.An anecdote: Occasionally in high school, I would hit a particularly difficult calculus problem and seek out my mechanical engineer father for help. I'd show him the problem, perhaps a particularly pernicious related rate problem. Instead of starting from the problem itself, my dad always wanted to make sure I understood all of the individual concepts required to complete it. The running joke is that if I came to him with a calculus problem, he'd start no later in the material than the formal definition of a derivative and go from there. It would take several chapters worth of content before we arrived at the actual matter at hand. I still enjoy ribbing my dad about his approach to calculus assistance. He's sitting across the room from me right now and when I told him what I was writing he just grinned and declared ""First principles! You must build block by block on first principles!"" Hello, Dad who I've exaggerated for comedic effect, meet John M. Barry.John Barry started this book with Hippocrates and Galen. He then spent 166 pages getting from ancient Greece to the scientific revolution in American medicine that occurred in the early 20th century. He provides painstaking detail surrounding the creation of Johns Hopkins University (to be fair, this was pretty interesting, it's just... not the 1918 influenza pandemic). He introduces a small army of doctors, bacteriologists, and medical researchers, all of whom played a role in dragging medicine into the 20th century via the scientific method.Then, we have a mighty record scratch and Barry decides to spend about 200 pages on the 1918 epidemic itself. The majority of individuals introduced in the first section of the book take a backseat to an almost mind-numbing number of U.S. military cantonments, local and national politicians, and morbidity and mortality statistics. The level of detail is overwhelming and largely made my eyes glaze over. Frustratingly, this part of the book felt almost entirely disconnected from the medical history discussed earlier. Due to the severity of the pandemic, the carefully laboratory work according to the scientific method had to be discarded for shortcuts and best guesses. I figured Barry would highlight this irony and while he mentioned it a time or two, he for the most part just kept barreling forward through the history.Record scratch number two. With the end of the pandemic, we return to a smaller subset of the cast of characters discussed prior to its arrival and follow their lives and research down a number of paths that are only tangentially related (if at all) to influenza. Many of the most important individuals from the first part of the book are discarded without providing any sort of conclusion to their story.The whole thing was immensely aggravating. Whenever I look at a marble sculptures in art museums, I marvel at the fact that a sculptor was able to look at a block of stone, see the figure within, and get rid of the extra to reveal what was there all along. The Great Influenza felt like John M. Barry looking at a block of marble, seeing David, sculpting away, and instead revealing a figure with six arms, two heads, and feet erupting Alien-like from its chest. There are probably two and a half good books contained within, but Barry couldn't see what to get rid of and editor Wendy Wolf certainly didn't take a firm enough hand. I'm genuinely alarmed at the thought of what this book looked like pre-editor after reading the bloated and muddled final result. Here's the kicker: in the acknowledgements, John Barry pulls back the curtain on the process of writing the book and fully reveals his obliviousness. Get a load of this:""This book was initially supposed to be a straightforward story of the deadliest epidemic in human history, told from the perspectives of both scientists who tried to fight it and political leaders who tried to respond to it. I though it would take me two and a half years to write, three at the most. That plan didn't work. Instead this book took seven years to write. It has evolved (and, I hope, grown) into something rather different than originally conceived.""NO JOHN, THE NEW PLAN PLAN DIDN'T WORK. YOU SHOULD HAVE STUCK WITH THE ORIGINAL. Seven years. Holy crud.Other nits to pick: I often felt like Barry had an agenda to push. At various times in the book, he would stake out rather extreme positions and seemed to only approach the history from that angle, with Wilson's approach to World War I and the U.S. military's approach to the pandemic being two of the major examples. Were either perfect? Certainly not, but Barry seemed almost to cast them as the villains of the influenza pandemic, a practice I found unhelpful. I was also distinctly uncomfortable with an insinuation Barry made about the death of Paul A. Lewis. Implying suicide shouldn't be thrown around without evidence, and Barry provided nothing concrete. Not cool, dude.The writing is also nothing to write home about. Barry has an annoying habit of repeating anecdotes throughout the book and if I see the sentence ""It was influenza, only influenza"" one more time, I might scream.It's probably 1.5 stars but I'm rounding up. So why two instead of one? I did learn some things and a number of individual threads in the book were interesting. Highlights include a better understanding of why Johns Hopkins has the reputation it does, what the Hs and Ns are in influenza (ex: the H1N1 strain), and the word enzootic*.In all honesty, though, I'd probably pass on this one. You can learn the bulk of the 1918 influenza-specific stuff more quickly and enjoyably via Wikipedia. *It is to animals what the word ""epidemic"" is to humans, which makes sense given the roots. I'm distinctly less excited about it now, though, having just looked up the pronunciation and realized that it is pronounced en-zoh-AH-tic instead of en-ZOO-tic. I suppose you can't win them all."
162,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3244513-mike,4,"Overall this was a very good book. Expansive, thorough, and at times utterly fascinating. I'm sure people around me are completely sick of me talking about the flu at this point but this is that kind of book that will do that to you. It falls short of getting five stars for a couple of reasons, some of which are about the book but most of which are about me as a reader:1. It's almost too expansive: In Barry's quest to explore every possible nook and cranny of the 1918 Influenza pandemic he leaves no scientific idea or historical actor unearthed and thoroughly discussed. This lends to a skater shot feel to the book as you lurch from one person to another in chronological order with whole chapters about the science of viruses and bacteria popping up here and there to interrupt the forward momentum of the story. I feel like I got a about a dozen very short, somewhat shallow, biographies in this one book and a bit more science that I really wanted. 2. Lack of a supporting personal story or strong main character: When I contrast this book with Steven Johnson's ""Ghost Map"", which is all about John Snow and how he dealt with a cholera outbreak in London in the 19th Century, I find that it didn't hold my attention all the time because I didn't really connect with any of the people in the book or feel like there was a broad narrative that was pulling me along. Sure, he does a good job of showing how the pandemic began, how it peaks, and how it ebbs but the pandemic is far too amorphous for me to really relate to. And while he clearly shows how many of the people in the book react at these different phases I didn't really feel like I got to know any of them with the kind of detail that Johnson pulled out of John Snow.3. Hey, you got your science book in my history book! No, you got your history book in my science book! Wow, they're two great genres that kind of make for a confusing mess when you put them all together: Okay, this gripe is all about me as a reader. I'm WAY more interested in history and politics than science. Unless the science is about robots, zombies, or space ships at a certain point I kind of just zone out. Barry, at times, gets super deep on the science of influenza explaining in great detail how it infects the body and causes no end of problems. While it is a great feat of writing to talk about that sort of thing without losing the reader (to his credit it was never confusing) it doesn't make for a compelling read for me. When Barry talks about history in this book it's completely riveting, I literally couldn't put it down, but then there would be a speed bump science chapter and I'd have to slog through it to get back to the ideas that were the most interesting to me. It made for a frustrating read at times.Over all I would highly recommend this book. It really was quite good, my gripes aside. And, frankly, the historical implications of the book make it worth the read alone (namely that at a crucial junction in the negotiation of the Treaty of Versailles at the end of World War I Pres. Wilson came down with the flu and it, for a bunch of reasons, left him possibly permanently mentally impaired - he believed from that point on that French spies had infiltrated the White House for example - is shocking. Given that that treaty is often held directly responsible for the rise of Nazi Germany, and World War II, and that the principle features of that treaty may have caused the rise of the Nazi's were almost all pushed by the French and opposed by Pres. Wison, until his bought with the flu that is, one is left believing if not for the flu the world could have been very different). If you like science and enjoy history I think this would be a very satisfying reading experience.As an aside, I gave this book to my Grandmother for Christmas in 2009 when she was 91 years old. She and I developed a pattern late in her life of me giving her books that I'd read that I liked for birthdays and Christmas. She was an avid reader and game to read anything, although like me her preferences were more inclined to history, biography, and travel. This was one of the rare books I gave her without reading first. When I asked her, on Christmas 2011, to lend me one of her favorite books she gave me this one. She was born in April of 1918, near the beginning of this book, and I think for her the book explained a lot of things people would mention in her childhood that never made much sense (relatives who died during the flu, particular idioms people would use, or beliefs they had about sickness). She died in March of 2012 just a month shy of 94. In reading this book I am profoundly impressed by her intelligence. This book is not an easy read in spots (there were sections I read twice) and for someone who didn't even finish high school to read this book and not only understand it but enjoy it is a testament to the amazing person she was. This book still has the post-it note she always put on the inside front cover of books she got as gifts with the date, occasion, and person(s) who gave it to her. While she may be gone it makes me happy that she and I could at least share this one last experience together. "

165,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/611813-melinda,4,"Re-reading again in 2020 in the middle of the coronavirus outbreak.This is an excellent book. Reading it in the time of Coronavirus is eye-opening. I wish that the shrill shrieking gerbils of the media would provide comparisons ""per population"" for their numbers, and also comparisons with the traditional flu. The 2nd half of the book is especially worthwhile in this time of pandemic.********I highly recommend this book! It reads like a ""who-done-it"", except that you know who did it (the influenza virus) and you are watching the medical scientists struggle to find solutions while the wild-fire of the 1918 influenza pandemic raged all around them. Will they find a solution in time? (see the bottom paragraph for an answer to this question)Before documenting the path of the 1918 influenza, the author lays the groundwork for the transformed medical atmosphere from the late 1800's into the early 1900's in America. This path thus shows the beginnings of the the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research, the Phipps Institute, and Johns Hopkins University. Names of medical pioneers and influenza warriors such as Paul Lewis (who proved that polio was caused by a virus in 1907 and developed a vaccine that was 100% effective in protecting monkeys), William Henry Welch (the single most powerful individual in the history of American medicine, who directed the rise of Johns Hopkins University, and who with John D. Rockefeller Jr. created the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research, arguablly the best scientific research institute in the world), Simon Flexner (first head of the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research, the man who brought the mortality rate for common bacterial meningitis down to 18% in 1919 WITHOUT antibiotics!), Rufus Cole (who made the Rockefeller Institute Hospital a model for the way clinical research is conducted), Army Surgeon General William Gorgas (whose work in abating the transmission of yellow fever and malaria by controlling the mosquitos saved hundreds of thousands of lives, and allowed construction on the Panama Canal), Oswald Avery (whose work on influenza would lead him to one of the most important scientific discoveries in the 20th century, that DNA is the material of which genes and chromosomes are made), Anna Wessel Williams (the leading female bacteriologist in the world who worked hand in hand with William Park trying to develop a serum or vaccine for influenza),William Park (teamed with Anna Wessel Williams, developed the diptheria antitoxin still in use today), andRichard Shope (who as the first to prove that a virus caused influenza) fill the pages of this book. After setting the stage with its influenza warriors and medical laboratories, the author then begins the saga of the influenza virus itself. Influenza struck in the first wave in the winter and spring of 1918, a mild ""three day fever"" form that most recovered from. The second wave hit in the fall of 1918. This wave was the most virulent and deadly. The third wave hit somewhere in the winter / spring of 1919, and was once again a less virulent form. In just 2 years the virus mutated into a super killer, then back into a more mild disease. In raw numbers, the lowest estimate of the worldwide death toll at the time was 20 million. Knowing what we know now, epidemiologists today estimate that influenza caused at least 50 million and possibly 100 million deaths worldwide. All that in a time when the population of the world was 1/3rd of what it is today. The terrifying aspect of the super killer influenza was that it did not strike the traditional victims... the old and the very young, but instead hit hardest in the age group of 20's and 30's. If the upper estimate of 100 million deaths is accurate, then 8 to 10 percent of all young adults then living were killed by the virus.And these deaths happened with blinding speed. The influenza pandemic stretched out over 2 years. But 2/3rds of the deaths occurred in a period of 24 weeks. That is about 66 million deaths in 24 weeks. Averaged out that would be 2.5 million deaths per week. Yet more than half of those 66 million deaths happened from mid-September to early December of 1918. That is really 33 million deaths in 10 to 12 weeks! That's 3.3 MILLION deaths PER WEEK in the late fall and early winter of 1918! And remember that the world population at the time was less than 1/3rd of what it is today (which is 6.8 billion people). The numbers are just staggering, and I had to keep reading them and figuring out the numbers and it still is a staggering thought. So many died in so short a time! Epidemiological evidence from the work of Dr. Loring Miner seems to show that the new influenza virus originated in Haskell County, Kansas early in the winter of 1918. Dr. Miner documented early cases of the new influenza that showed disturbing mortality rates in a very short period of time. The virus then went to a huge army base in the eastern part of the state as troops were gathered in preparation for their deployment to Europe for WWI. From that army base, soliders were sent to France, soldiers were transferred to other bases in the United States....and the disease began sweeping through North America, Europe, South America, Asia, Africa, and the entire world. Some situations requiring fast decision making in chaotic circumstances were carried out well. Other situations were not handled as well. The ins and outs of these crossing paths of decisions, deaths mounting rapidly, politics, mililtary directives, and newly formed medical laboratories make up the rest of the book. The story is staggering, but gripping. In answer to the question at the beginning of this review, the answer is ""no, the medical scientists did not find a solution during the time of the 1918 thru 1920 influenza pandemic"". They learned alot, yes. They also learned that the only way to be protected from the disease was through isolation from it. Medical practices helping and treating the ill were improved, but a vaccine was never been found. The only reason the killing influenza stopped killing was because it mutated away from the more virulent form into a milder form. So the question immediately to ask is ""what happens if the virus mutates back to the virulent form?"". And that is the question we are left with at the end of the book. In the concluding chapter, the author raises these issues and concludes tentatively that in pandemic times, an authorized power (government, World Health Organization, army, someone) must have the authority to act and to act quickly, and their decisions must trump individual freedoms. Mandatory vaccinations, mandatory quaranatine, mandatory travel restrictions are the things that must be done to protect the larger population. The ""needs of the many outweigh the needs of the one"", if I may quote a Star Trek movie. In times of such overwhelming medical need, quick decisions must be made and sometimes they must be harsh."

In the present there is a virulent influenza outbreak and in the past there is the plague sweeping through England.

168,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10978428-jim,4,"The bodies were piling up. The undertakers, themselves falling sick, were overwhelmed. There was no place to put the bodies. Gravediggers were either sick or refused to bury the influenza victims. Caskets were stacking up...then they ran short of caskets. The city morgue filled up. The stench was terrible...this was Philadelphia, October 1918, the time of the so-called ""Spanish flu."" Barry gives us a panoramic view of the most lethal influenza outbreak in history which occurred in 1918-1919. Today we believe that the death toll in the United States was 675,000 out of a population of 105 million. As many as 100 million died worldwide out of a global population of 1.8 billion, more than 5% of the world's population.  Barry follows the movement of the flu virus across the world, starting in rural Kansas, where somehow the virus crossed the animal-human barrier (from chickens?). It erupted in an Army camp in Kansas and moved east with the soldiers and then went on the troopships with them to Europe...It came in three waves, that first wave that hit the soldiers in the spring of 1918 was rather mild. But then in the fall, there was the second wave that was much more virulent--that's when most of the deaths occurred. Then the virus mutated again and there was a third wave which hit places like Australia--which had not been hit so hard by the second wave. Much of the book is involved with the story of the scientists battling the virus. Barry goes into some detail about this and focuses on some key figures. As he explains, a revolution had occurred in American medicine where labs had been organized and work was going on with the expectation that disease could be conquered by modern science. When it came to the great influenza, science failed. We are still living with the consequences of that.  The book was published in 2004 and, in it, Barry warns that we will face another pandemic. It's only a question of when. He states that we are NOT prepared for a pandemic. The events of this year of 2020 shows that he was right."
169,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6949571-thomas-paul,5,"It killed more people in 6 months than the Black Death killed in a century. People who were young and strong were the most likely to die. In the US, 650,000 people died. The average life expectancy in the US went down by 10 years. Worldwide, perhaps 100 million people died. And yet, it was only the flu. Even today, 90 years after the epidemic, it kills 36,000 Americans in a typical year and we are hardly more prepared to face another epidemic.John M. Barry has written a fascinating account of the influenza epidemic of 1918. But the book is a lot more than just a review of the flu. Barry starts out by examining the state of the American health system at the time of the epidemic and how it reached that state. He explores the revolutionary changes to medicine that occurred in the late 19th and early 20th century and the people who led those changes. He shows us why, even today, a cure for influenza is beyond our reach, explaining in layman’s terms how the influenza virus changes to become deadly and changes again to lose that deadliness. He explains how an endemic virus can lead to an epidemic of unimagined proportions.Barry also shows how the demands of World War I on troop movements, the propaganda campaigns to keep morale high, and the failure of leaders to listen to the doctors and researchers led to a killing field of historic size. His account tends to concentrate on Philadelphia because the city was hit extremely hard and much of the research going on was near that city but he does cover other areas around the world hit hard by the virus, although his coverage of the flu outside of the US is sketchy at best. He gives us writings from diaries and newspaper articles to show what was actually happening and how the media tried to downplay the epidemic. He gives us detailed accounts of the research (and the researchers) that was done to fight the epidemic, explains why this research was mostly unsuccessful, and does it all in a way that is easy to understand even if you don’t have a medical degree.Barry likes to use foreshadowing, hints of what is to come, to keep the reader’s interest and it does work, even if it is a bit melodramatic. Even the chapter titles, “The Tinderbox”, “It Begins”, The Race”, provide some melodrama to the story. The book mostly moves at a good pace and I found myself having trouble putting it down. Barry has written a book that everyone should read, whether you are familiar with the epidemic or not. It is a fascinating, terrifying, detailed, and extremely important book."
170,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8298053-colleen-browne,3,"This book starts out with a summary of medicine from Hippocrates to the First World War. That seems like it would be a long slog but because there was so little advancement during that time, it is done fairly quickly. As a reader with very limited knowledge of the history of medicine, I found this very interesting. What I didn't know at the beginning of the book was that the better part of the book was spent with the author going off on tangents only peripherally related to the pandemic. There is a great deal of information in this book, too much information. This book could have done with a good editor. The length of the book was about the same length as most of the books I read, and in many cases, much shorter but it didn't feel that way. It felt much longer. Barry's use of metaphor was helpful in explaining his subject and his style of writing wasn't awful as many reviewers have charged but he didn't seem to know when to stop on those threads that he followed out to what felt like oblivion at times. This is the first book I have read devoted to the subject (and may be the last). I could not recommend this book; at least not to anyone just interested in the pandemic. I can only suppose that there are better books on the topic."

173,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68316850-gavin,3,"Rousing history of one of the worst things that has ever happened: the 1918 outbreak of H1N1 flu. It focusses particularly on the great scientists who tried to fight it, none of whom I'd ever heard of. Also a meditation on epistemology, the modern mind, & the redemptive meaning of science for beasts like us.Barry senses that the headline result - one-third of the entire world infected, with 
25-100
 million dead - doesn't get enough of a rise from us. The numbers are numbing. So he couches it in modern shocking terms:
 It killed more people in twenty-four weeks than AIDS has killed in twenty-four years, more in a year than the Black Death killed in a century.
Or ten thousand 9/11s. It's worth belabouring this, because we have a weird habit of paying far more attention to human threats than natural ones, even when natural ones are far worse. (Witness our terrorism prevention budgets compared to our infectious disease control budgets, when the latter is a thousand times more lethal.)So: The 1918 flu was worse than the entire First World War: 40+ million died of flu compared with 17 million dead from war; 500 million lives damaged by flu vs 41 million lives by war. 3% of everyone alive died of flu, including about 8% of young adults(!).Except it's hard to separate the War and the pandemic. The virus was spread everywhere by unprecedented numbers of troops, and by the massive supply convoys it induced, and by the War's other human displacements. We don't know how many of the pneumonia deaths only occurred because of the logistical degradation, poverty and pestilence of wartime. There are terrible nonlinearities involved in overcrowding and global movement of troops. But add millions at least to the overall death toll caused by WWI.The book is in the epic mode, all the way through. (That's not a straightforward compliment.) I liked it, but I understand if it's a bit American for you:
Man might be defined as “modern” largely to the extent that he attempts to control nature. In this relationship with nature, modern humanity has generally been the aggressor, and a daring one at that, altering the flow of rivers, building upon geological faults, and, today, even engineering the genes of existing species. Nature has generally been languid in its response, although contentious once aroused and occasionally displaying a flair for violence.By 1918 humankind was fully modern, and fully scientific, but too busy fighting itself to aggress against nature. Nature, however, chooses its own moments. It chose this moment to aggress against man, and it did not do so prodding languidly. For the first time, modern humanity, a humanity practicing the modern scientific method, would confront nature in its fullest rage.
There's a long prelude describing how terrible medicine was up to the 20th Century. Medicine was ""the withered arm of science"". Therapeutic nihilism (that is, ""we can't really do anything"") was the only rational view, replacing millenia of Galenic woo.
Stengel reviewed dozens of ideas advanced in medical journals. Gargles of various disinfectants. Drugs. Immune sera. Typhoid vaccine. Diphtheria antitoxin. But Stengel’s message was simple: This doesn’t work. That doesn’t work. Nothing worked... Nothing they were doing worked.
Problem is, this rational scepticism created a powerful vacuum: humans need to believe something can heal, and the gap was filled with worse. Some confabulated gremlins from this time haunt us still: homeopathy, chiropractic, naturopathy, Christian Science, and (though Barry doesn't include them) the organic farming movement and psychoanalysis.Few people come off well. Even among the scientists, we get a horrible example of perverse priors and premature updating: an enormous proportion of all scientific resources were devoted to fighting the wrong pathogen, due to a bad guess by an extremely eminent researcher.Because so much of the state was occupied in war, in places there was wholesale social collapse:
In Philadelphia meanwhile fear came and stayed. Death could come from anyone, anytime. People moved away from others on the sidewalk, avoided conversation; if they did speak, they turned their faces away to avoid the other person’s breathing. The impossibility of getting help compounded the isolation. 850 Philadelphia doctors and more nurses were away in the military. More than that number were sick. Philadelphia General Hospital had 126 nurses. Despite all precautions, despite wearing surgical masks and gowns, eight doctors and fifty-four nurses—43 percent of the staff—themselves required hospitalization. Ten nurses at this single hospital died. The Board of Health pleaded for help from retired nurses and doctors if they remembered “even a little” of their profession.When a nurse or doctor or policeman did actually come, they wore their ghostly surgical masks, and people fled them. In every home where someone was ill, people wondered if the person would die. And someone was ill in every home...Starr went to Emergency Hospital #2 at Eighteenth and Cherry Streets. He did have help, if it could be called that, from an elderly physician who had not practiced in years and who brought Starr into touch with the worst of heroic medicine. Starr wouldn’t forget that, the ancient arts of purging, of venesection, the ancient art of opening a patient’s vein. But for the most part he and the other students elsewhere were on their own, with little help even from nurses, who were so desperately needed that in each of ten emergency hospitals supplied by the Red Cross only a single qualified nurse was available to oversee whatever women came as volunteers. And often the volunteers reported for their duty once and, from either fear or exhaustion, did not come again.Nearly 1/4 of all the patients in his hospital died each day. Starr would go home, and when he returned the next day, he would find that between one-quarter and one-fifth of the patients in the hospital had died, replaced by new ones... Virtually all of them, along with their friends and relatives, were terrified that, no matter how mild the symptoms seemed at first, within them moved an alien force, a seething, spreading infection, a live thing with a will that was taking over their bodies — and could be killing them...The city was frozen with fear, frozen into stillness. Starr lived 12 miles from the hospital. The streets were silent on his drive home, silent. They were so silent he took to counting the cars he saw. One night he saw no cars at all. He thought, “The life of the city had almost stopped.”
Everyone can read the collapse of official power in Philadelphia as supporting their politics. Anarchists can point to the benevolent spontaneous order that arose after the corrupt local government failed to act; libertarians can point out that this spontaneous order was all funded by the richest Philadelphians; statists can point out that, without actually-authoritative co-ordination, the effort eventually failed, because people defected against each other, in fear.
The corpses had backed up at undertakers’, filling every area of these establishments and pressing up into living quarters; in hospital morgues overflowing into corridors; in the city morgue overflowing into the street. And they had backed up in homes. They lay on porches, in closets, in corners of the floor, on beds. Children would sneak away from adults to stare at them, to touch them; a wife would lie next to a dead husband, unwilling to move him or leave him. The corpses, reminders of death and bringers of terror or grief, lay under ice at Indian-summer temperatures. Their presence was constant, a horror demoralizing the city; a horror that could not be escaped. Finally the city tried to catch up to them.The police wore their ghostly surgical masks, and people fled them, but the masks had no effect on the viruses and by mid-October thirty-three policemen had died, with many more to follow... More coffins came by rail, guarded by men with guns.
""There is, therefore, but one response possible from us: Force! force to the utmost, force without stint or limit, the righteous and triumphant force which shall make right the law of the world and cast every selfish dominion down in the dust. ""- Woodrow Wilson addressing one of his money-lending mobs.Wilson tends to be viewed pretty positively, just because he won. (""at last the world knows America as the savior of the world!"") But he perverted an entire state and nation to do so, ignored the terrible suffering of his own damn population for years, and refused a conditional peace with Austria in August and with the Kaiser's new parliament in September. (This meant 30-70 extra days of war, which, if this period was as lethal as the rest of the war, means up to 800,000 completely unnecessary deaths, not to mention the continuing waste of resources during the worst epidemic ever). Wilson did great evil, was not much different from the Kaiser, the election aside.
 the military suctioned more and more nurses and physicians into cantonments, aboard ships, into France, until it had extracted nearly all the best young physicians. Medical care for civilians deteriorated rapidly. The doctors who remained in civilian life were largely either incompetent young ones or those over forty-five years of age, the vast majority of whom had been trained in the old ways of medicine. 
Barry's middle chapters are a frightening portrait of how rabidly un-American the US was in 1918. The laws were bad enough - for instance the ban on criticising the government. But then there's the unofficial ""patriotic duties"", punishable by beatings. State-sponsored atavism.
By the summer of 1918, however, Wilson had injected the government into every facet of national life and had created great bureaucratic engines to focus all the nation’s attention and intent on the war.He had created a Food Administration to control and distribute food, a Fuel Administration to ration coal and gasoline, a War Industries Board to oversee the entire economy. He had taken all but physical control over the railroads and had created a federally sponsored river barge line that brought commerce back to life on the Mississippi River, a commerce that had been killed by competition from those railroads. He had built many dozens of military installations, each of which held at least tens of thousands of soldiers or sailors. He had created industries that made America’s shipyards teem with hundreds of thousands of laborers launching hundreds of ships, dug new coal mines to produce coal for the factories that weaned America’s military from British and French weapons and munitions—for, unlike in World War II, America was no arsenal of democracy.He had created a vast propaganda machine, an internal spy network, a bond-selling apparatus... He had even succeeded in stifling speech, in the summer of 1918 arresting and imprisoning — some for prison terms longer than ten years —not just radical labor leaders and editors of German-language newspapers but powerful men, even a congressman.He had injected the government into American life in ways unlike any other in the nation’s history. And the final extension of federal power had come only in the spring of 1918, after the first wave of influenza had begun jumping from camp to camp, when the government expanded the draft from males between the ages of twenty-one and thirty to those between the ages of eighteen and forty-five. Only on May 23, 1918, had Provost Marshal Enoch Crowder, who oversaw the draft, issued his “work or fight” order, stating that anyone not employed in an essential industry would be drafted...Crowder bragged about doing “in a day what the Prussian autocracy had been spending nearly fifty years to perfect...""In mid-August, as the lethal wave of the epidemic was gathering itself, Austria had already inquired about peace terms, an inquiry that Wilson rebuffed utterly. And as the epidemic was gathering full momentum, peace was only weeks away. Bulgaria had signed an armistice on September 29. On September 30, Kaiser Wilhelm had granted parliamentary government to the German nation; that same day Ludendorff had warned his government that Germany must extend peace feelers or disaster—immediate disaster—would follow. German diplomats sent out those feelers. Wilson ignored them. The Central Powers, Germany and her allies, were simultaneously breaking off one from one another and disintegrating internally as well. In the first week of October, Austria and Germany separately sent peace feelers to the Allies, and on October 7, Austria delivered a diplomatic note to Wilson formally seeking peace on any terms Wilson chose. Ten days later — days of battle and deaths — the Austrian note remained unanswered.Earlier Wilson had spoken of a “peace without victory,” believing only such a peace could last. But now he gave no indication that the war would soon be over. Although a rumor that the war had ended sent thrills through the nation, Wilson quickly renounced it. Nor would he relent. He was not now fighting to the death; he was fighting only to kill...If Wilson and his government would not be turned from his end even by the prospect of peace, they would hardly be turned by a virus. And the reluctance, inability, or outright refusal of the American government to shift targets would contribute to the killing. Wilson took no public note of the disease, and the thrust of the government was not diverted. The relief effort for influenza victims would find no assistance in the Food Administration or the Fuel Administration or the Railroad Administration. From neither the White House nor any other senior administration post would there come any leadership, any attempt to set priorities, any attempt to coordinate activities, any attempt to deliver resources....the military would give no help to civilians. Instead it would draw further upon civilian resources. The same day that Welch had stepped out of the autopsy room at Devens and called Gorgas’s office, his warning had been relayed to the army chief of staff, urging that all transfers be frozen unless absolutely necessary and that under no circumstances transfers from infected camps be made... Gorgas’s superiors ignored the warning. There was no interruption of movement between camps whatsoever; not until weeks later, with the camps paralyzed and, literally, tens of thousands of soldiers dead or dying, did the army make any adjustments.
Because the disease was everywhere, ravaging the entire species (and beyond), the book can't cover everything. Very little is said about non-Americans, i.e about 98% of the death and chaos. This is partly because there just isn't a lot of evidence about them, despite their influenza immunity and medical care being even worse. (This is why the top estimates reach 100m deaths, three times the median estimate.) Here is a passage about just a tiny number of them, in the north:
In Alaska, whites protected themselves. Sentries guarded all trails, and every person entering the city was quarantined for five days. Eskimos had no such luck. A senior Red Cross official warned that without “immediate medical assistance the race” could become “extinct.”...The navy provided the collier USS Brutus to carry a relief expedition... They found terrible things. One doctor visited ten tiny villages and found “three wiped out entirely; others average 85% deaths… Survivors generally children… probably 25% frozen to death before help arrived.”The virus probably did not kill all of them directly. But it struck so suddenly it left no one well enough to care for any others, no one to get food, no one to get water. And those who could have survived, surrounded by bodies, bodies of people they loved, might well have preferred to go where their family had gone, might well have wanted to no longer be alone... Two hundred sixty-six people had lived in Okak, and many dogs, dogs nearly wild. When the virus came, it struck so hard so fast people could not care for themselves or feed the dogs. The dogs grew hungry, crazed with hunger, devoured each other, then wildly smashed through windows and doors, and fed... In all of Labrador, at least one-third the total population died. 
---Barry commits at least one big error: he's horrified by the medical schools of the time having ""no standards for admission"":
 In research and education especially, American medicine lagged far behind [European medicine]... At least one hundred US medical schools would accept any man willing to pay tuition... and only a single medical school required its student to have a college degree... the Johns Hopkins itself, not student fees, paid [its] faculty salaries, and it required medical students to have not only a college degree but fluency in French and German and a background of science courses. 
But his enthusiasm for Johns Hopkins introducing the college degree requirement is misplaced. Contemporary US doctors (who all have 3 years of pre-med, or even more college, before they start medical training) are probably no better clinicians than undergraduate doctors in other countries, and are far further in debt. This requirement is probably one reason the American system is so fucked.I suppose Barry is just confusing the open admissions situation with the schools' appallingly low graduation standards, which is certainly one reason eC20th medicine sucked. (Many doctors had never looked down a microscope, never used a stethoscope on a patient, never seen a dissection.)---PS: Mostly unimportant corrections by a virologist here. Reply to these from Barry here."
174,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22063432-tom-mathews,5,"The old adage that 'those who fail to learn from the past are condemned to repeat it' has never been so true. President George W. Bush read this book shortly after it was published and was so impressed by the threat of future pandemics that he commissioned a department whose sole function was to prepare for future pandemics. This involved cooperation by federal, state and international entities (such as the WHO) to set up surveillance networks for potentially deadly diseases and to stockpile drugs and equipment such as mechanical ventilators that could be used in the event of a sharp spike in the number of inpatient hospitalizations. Unfortunately, the current president quickly defunded and essentially disbanded all of President Bush's efforts to prepare for what scientists and even foresighted politicians knew was inevitable. In his book, Barry wrote of the things that people did to protect themselves in 1918-19 and recommendations for what we could do when the next pandemic occurred. There was actually very few differences between the two lists: masks, hand-washing, social distancing and the cancelling of large gatherings being prominent on both lists. Barry asserted that our greatest chance of preventing a full-scale calamity lay in forethought and preparation. We will never know if that would have had much of an impact. When Barry wrote this book he likely couldn't have foreseen the political situation the U.S. finds itself in today but he knew politicians. He knew that in order to avoid boosting the enemy's morale in wartime, our leaders refused to speak honestly about the seriousness of the influenza pandemic and, as a result, millions died. But if he thought that politicians today were any better, he likely wouldn't have written in the afterward of one edition ""On a larger scale, and far more difficult, will be getting governments to tell the truth about the disease. This is perhaps the biggest lesson about 1918 and it is a lesson not yet learned.""I try to avoid revealing spoilers in my reviews but these are unusual times and I think that the best way to close this review is to let Barry do it for me. Here are the closing paragraphs in this magnificent work:
So the final lesson of 1918, a simple one yet one most difficult to execute, is that those who occupy positions of authority must lessen the panic that can alienate all within a society. Society cannot function if it is every man for himself. By definition, civilization cannot survive that. Those in authority must retain the public’s trust. The way to do that is to distort nothing, to put the best face on nothing, to try to manipulate no one. Lincoln said that first, and best. A leader must make whatever horror exists concrete. Only then will people be able to break it apart.

176,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4739424-mal-warwick,5,"A century ago a pandemic disease far more lethal than COVID-19 killed an estimated fifty to one hundred million people around the world—as many as one out of every twenty people then alive. The 1918 flu epidemic erupted during a war that had already killed tens of millions and at a time when medical science was far less accomplished than it is today. Although there are lessons to learn for our response to COVID-19, it’s important to view what happened then in its historical context. And that’s the approach John M. Barry so brilliantly takes in The Great Influenza. This engrossing book may well be one of the very best ever written on medical history.The historical context of the 1918 flu epidemicAs Barry makes clear, medical science had taken big steps forward in the decades before the pandemic erupted, especially in the United States. Half a century earlier, German researchers, and French to a lesser extent, led the world in medical research. However, by the outbreak of World War I, two institutions had spearheaded immense advances in American medicine: Johns Hopkins Hospital and the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research (later Rockefeller University).Johns Hopkins Hospital, founded in 1889, had been established expressly to bring the scientific method into the teaching and practice of medicine in the United States. The Rockefeller Institute set out from day one to become the world’s most important medical research institution, and many observers have expressed the opinion that it succeeded very shortly after its establishment in 1901. Barry traces the evolution of both Johns Hopkins and the Rockefeller (as they were then known) through in-depth sketches of the prominent physicians who led them. Those doctors, the heroes of the tale, played leadership roles in combating the 1918 flu epidemic, advising the military and government at all levels on precautionary measures and researching the origins of the disease and possible treatment. Unfortunately, they made little headway in either respect.Why the disease spread so widely and so quicklyThe doctors’ increasingly strident insistence on warning the public about the epidemic were met with rigid resistance until hundreds of thousands of Americans had already died. The Wilson administration had instituted draconian measures to prevent any news from reaching the public that would turn its attention from the need to support the war effort. Although press censorship was not in force, the nation’s press almost uniformly self-censored, parroting the official line that the disease was not serious while bodies piled up in the morgues. The result then, as it is today in the COVID-19 pandemic, was that those who denied the problem lost the public’s trust. But the biggest reason the influenza spread so widely and so quickly was the insistence of the US Army on transferring troops in large numbers from one base to another in crowded trains and then overseas in crowded ships.The 1918 flu epidemic was “the deadliest pandemic in history”Although up to five percent of the world’s population—and “as many as 8 to 10 percent of all young adults then living—died from the so-called “Spanish influenza,” its impact was not limited to the appalling death toll. Naturally, the pandemic greatly influenced the course of medical research and the adoption of public health measures far more widely than had been the case. But its consequences were far-reaching both in the conduct of World War I and in the shape of the peace that emerged from the conflict. Barry skillfully explores both themes in The Great Influenza.How the epidemic helped defeat GermanyIn April 1918, German commander Erich Ludendorff began “his last great offensive—Germany’s last real chance to win the war. The . . . offensive made great initial gains.” But then it stalled. Barry quotes the diary of a US Army surgeon stationed near the front: “‘The expected third phase of the great German offensive gets put off from day to day . . . I gather that the epidemic of grippe which hit us rather hard in Flanders also hit the Boche worse, and this may have caused the delay.'” In fact, Ludendorff himself “blamed influenza for the loss of initiative and the ultimate failure of the offensive.” No single battle necessarily changes the course of any war (although Midway, Stalingrad, and the Normandy Invasion are all claimed to have done just that in the next war.) But contemporary observers in 1918, and military analysts now, seem to agree that however slim the likelihood that Germany might end up victorious was certainly then lost.How the 1918 flu epidemic helped cause World War IIHistorians agree that the Treaty of Versailles that brought World War I to a close was a disaster. The excessive pain it imposed on Germany is almost universally acknowledged to have led in virtually a straight line to the Second World War. Yet that treaty took the form it did only because, midway through the peace conference, the world’s most popular statesman, Woodrow Wilson, suddenly and unaccountably “abandoned principles he had previously insisted upon. He yielded to [French Prime Minister Georges] Clemenceau everything of significance Clemenceau wanted, virtually all of which Wilson had earlier opposed.” Clemenceau was the primary architect of the harsh provisions incorporated into the treaty.Most accounts of Wilson’s strange turnabout at Versailles ascribe it to a minor stroke he suffered. The President was, in fact, in his sickbed when he made the fateful decision. However, Barry cites powerful evidence that Wilson had not in fact suffered a stroke. He had the flu. “Wilson’s actual symptoms—including high fever, severe coughing, and total prostration, [were] all symptoms that perfectly fit influenza and have no association whatsoever with stroke . . . Indeed, the virus may have contributed to the [severe] stroke” Wilson suffered much later that incapacitated him and led to his death.Where the “Spanish flu” really originatedWithin months of its appearance in the United States, the 1918 flu epidemic quickly went pandemic throughout Western Europe. The “Great War” was in its final months at the time, and rigid press censorship was in force on both sides of the trenches. Thus, even though thousands of American, French, British, and German troops were falling ill throughout the war zone, no news about their plight reached the home front in any one of the combatant countries. Neutral Spain, however, was different. There, alarmist reports about the virulence of the fast-spreading disease were splashed all over front pages. And that was how the epidemic came to be dubbed the “Spanish flu.”In fact, as Barry reports in detail, the deadly strain of H1N1 influenza at the heart of the 1918 flu epidemic almost certainly originated in Haskell County, Kansas, early that year. From there, the disease made its way eastward to a huge army “cantonment” where tens of thousands of troops were preparing to be shipped to France as cannon fodder for “Black Jack” Pershing‘s push against the German lines. Tens of thousands never made it there, falling victim instead to the flu. And, in carrying the disease to Europe, they triggered its spread to both Allied and enemy troops as well as civilian populations throughout Western Europe and ultimately to the rest of the world.How the 1918 flu epidemic was different from COVID-19In two major respects, the pandemic of a century ago differed significantly from what we are experiencing as I write:** Influenza is a respiratory disease that primarily attacks the lungs, nose, and throat. When it kills, it does so primarily through pneumonia. Although COVID-19 was initially feared to be similar in its effects, it is in truth a vascular disease that manifests through the circulatory system. ** It’s difficult for scientists to calculate the mortality (death) rate of a disease. But it is clear that the H1N1 influenza virus that emerged in 1918 was far more lethal than the COVID-19 strains that have been seen to date. Hundreds of thousands are dying today. Eventually, it seems likely that globally millions will do so. But it seems highly unlikely that the death toll will rise into the tens of millions as was the case a century ago.However, there is one significant way in which the two pandemics are similar. History tends to refer to the earlier pandemic as the “1918 flu epidemic,” suggesting that a first, relatively mild strain broke out in the spring of that year, followed by a second, far more lethal strain in the fall. In fact, though, the second wave lasted until 1919—and there was a third wave in 1920. Medical researchers tell us that COVID-19 is almost certain to behave in a similar fashion. As I write, we are experiencing either the first or the second wave of the disease (the experts differ). Yet another outbreak seems certain, with or without the speedy development of a vaccine—polyannish predictions to the contrary notwithstanding."

Outside of these few very well-known accounts, there is almost nothing in literature about it afterwards. They write about horrors that people inflict on people. Apparently they forget the horrors that nature inflicts on people, the horrors that make humans least significant. And yet the pandemic resonated.” Times like these only help us get perspective, Human race suffers from Amnesia and keeps forgetting the one and biggest truth of all. As Nietzsche's said - ""In some remote corner of the universe, poured out and glittering in innumerable solar systems, there once was a star on which clever animals invented knowledge. That was the highest and most mendacious minute of ""world history""—yet only a minute. After nature had drawn a few breaths the star grew cold, and the clever animals had to die."" We are nothing but a speck of dust in the grand scheme of things and times like these keep reminding us that. But times likes also explain why we are most thriving species on the earth today. We have invented these abstract concepts of ""Love"" , ""Compassion"" and ""Hope"" and that's what defines us. At the end this will be over I hope we are able to learn something out of this. This is an amazing read in my mind. The book not just telling the story of the pandemic but the foundations of the medical science in America. The author has done an amazing job covering different aspect of those times and I can certainly draw similarities in the current ongoing situations. It has definitely given me perspective. Help me interpret the media ( social/news) and conceive a bigger picture. "

The early history of the practice medicine in this country and lack of training of the doctors was jaw dropping. During WWI, academic instruction in general suffered due to total commitment to the war effort. ""In view of the comparatively short time during which most of the student-soldiers will remain in college and the exacting military duties awaiting them, academic instruction must necessarily be modified along the lines of direct military value.""I appreciated the great detail used in explaining the scientific rigor in trying to understand the disease that was plaguing the country and world.

I don't know if it's poorly-written or poorly-edited, but there were places were the same thing was said within pages of each other. And boring?!? Honestly, I was looking for a book about the flu to read during flu-season (especially in the year I decided NOT to get the flu shot), and all we get is lengthy biographies about the doctors and people who... well, I'm not even sure how most of them are important to the story. Really, when you pick up a book about a deadly disease you want to read about the deadly disease, and not wait for a couple hundred pages for it to appear or get good. The book is going back on the shelf but I guess I'll leave my bookmark where it is, just in case I get really bored."
180,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72479728-bryan-alkire,3,"Turned out to be ok, but given my high expectations for the book, ultimately disappointing. Before I get talk about the book itself, I’d like to say a few words about the peril of popular historical analogy. Really, this current Corona virus and the 1918 flu are not equivalent. Different diseases different times different responses. For starters, 1918 was a war economy. If people had chirped about lack of toilet paper or individual rights to be out and about, they would have been swiftly muzzled. Second, the government involvement at the federal level was vastly different. In 1918 the federal government did absolutely nothing, tot even brave words of comfort, for civilians suffers the flu. Today the government is throwing massive amounts of money at the problem even if it is at the behest of business special interests. At least the government is trying something. In fact, the only thing similar is that local governments are bearing the brunt of the response and that said response is a patchwork and that the media is following local government lead, in 1918 largely silent about the danger, in 2020 loudly proclaiming from the rooftops about the dangers. The last difference is the most important, different diseases. The 1918 flu struck quickly with a 48 to 72-hour incubation period and often killed suddenly as short as 12 hours after symptoms largely because the body’s immune system had to mount such a vigorous defense that if killed the body in the process. This corona virus is a two-week incubation period and seems to be more of a slow and more predictable killer.  Hopefully you’re still reading at this point as I will now discuss the book. I like books on pandemics when I can find them. They’re interesting and often draw lessons, usually for apocalypse writers, but unfortunately, real life currently. I chose this book because it’s the popular definitive work on the 1918 flu and that’s where the book falls short. The The organization of this book is just bad. It’s a confusing narrative structure with no real timeline and constant doubling back and forth interspersed with chapters on diseases and the like. It’s extremely repetitive. The writing is uneven. Sometimes it slows admirably and at other times gets bogged down in statistics and detail. The book also becomes awfully dry at times, particularly when discussing diseases themselves in quite detailed fashion. The content is also uneven. There’s lots here which isn’t truly relevant like medical school history and the life stories of doctors whose insolvent with the flu was more administrate than actual work. In short, this book was just a mess and clearly there was no good editing done on it. This book could have been a lot better than it was. So, I give this a 3. It’s interesting and at times, quite readable and even compelling. But, it’s dismally organized and edited. It could have been much better. "
181,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12087691-wendyb,5," A must-read book for the times we live in.Starts out with maybe just a little too much background on some of the doctors involved in the 1918 flu research but still interesting info on the state of medicine at that time.Got really interesting with the info on the start of the flu and the effect on the population.In researching my family background, I discovered my grandparents' first child died in Oct 1918 of the Spanish Flu at just 12 days old.

182,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5364077-connie-g,4,"The great influenza pandemic of 1918-1920 killed between 20 to 100 million people worldwide, more fatalities than any other pandemic in history. Unlike most influenza, this one targeted young people in their 20s and 30s. Although it's called the Spanish flu because the Spanish press had extensive coverage of the disease, it's thought to have originated in Kansas. Soldiers carried the disease as they traveled between crowded military facilities, then crossed the Atlantic on crowded boats to fight in World War I.Author John M. Barry also writes about the advances in medical education and medical research in the United States which occurred just before the pandemic. The Johns Hopkins Medical School and the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research were highlighted. He goes into great detail describing the lives and work of the medical researchers. While the pandemic was raging, researchers were not able to identify the viral pathogen, and many thought that the bacteria causing secondary infections was responsible. The book contains excellent descriptions of how a virus attacks human cells and replicates in the body. The mutation of viruses and the development of vaccines are also discussed.Barry also writes about the way politics and misinformation from public officials exacerbated the pandemic of 1918. Although the book was written in 2004, it has warnings that are important today during the COVID crisis. This timely book is interesting and well researched, although some readers may find there is too much detail about the medical schools and researchers."
183,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2190636-joselito-honestly-and-brilliantly,5,"The 1918 Flu Pandemic coincided with the First World War and it killed more than both the military and civilian casualties of the conflict yet while the war generated an avalanche of literature (poems, songs, music, fiction, films, biographies and autobiographies) not much serious work had been done about this pandemic until this book published in 2004.I read this a few years back and I’ve disposed of my copy already but since it was a gripping, unforgettable read, I could still recall some tidbits of information about this 1918 pandemic in relation with what we are now experiencing during the present one.First of all, and this is what is often found to be the most surprising about whatever virus was it which caused the 1918 pandemic, the most vulnerable was those who were physically fit and at the prime of their lives (think those in their 20’s or 30’s who eat healthy and go to the gym). Contrast this with with most of the present Covid 19 fatalities who are old and who had pre-existing health issues. But why is that? For some reasons, the body’s immune system or antibodies react to the 1918 virus in a weird way. They overreact or overdo things. The analogy is that when a fly (the virus) enters a house (the human body) someone drops an atom bomb (the antibodies) on it to kill the fly and because of it even the house is completely destroyed. So that is why it was the healthy and the strong who mostly died: they were the ones with stronger antibodies.Secondly, the incubation period for the 1918 virus was apparently shorter. I think there was a story in the book about someone talking gaily on a street, apparently healthy, then in just an hour or so would die there in that same place. Or a bus of healthy-looking people stopping before it reaches its destination because its driver (with 6 of its passengers) dropping dead.The 1918 pandemic killed about 100 Million people worldwide. No one knew how it was stopped. Probably it just got tired of killing people."

The book is very dry to read. The writing is repetitive and it drags on and on. Part 1 is the development of American medical science (public health study, John Hopkins Medical School etc...). Part 2 is mostly US politics (Woodrow Wilson, WWI and how wartime censorship was implemented). The rest is about the pandemic. The book should be better titled as ""The Great Influenza and How the US Dealt With It"", because it covers only a little outside the United States.At least 50m people (5% world population) had been wiped out by the pandemic, which is equivalent to 390m people today. There were three waves in the pandemic, the second wave the worst. In US, the condition in East Coast was worse than the west coast. San Francisco managed relatively well among big cities in US. Scientists did not find out the pathogen until many years later. The genome of the virus was sequenced in 2005.What strikes me most is that how the US politics today regarding Covid-19 has much in common with what happened in the 1918-1919 pandemic.

188,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35645863-lena,5,"Beyond five stars. How many books are entertaining, important, engaging and edifying? I can only think of one, this one.  I thought this was going to read like a thriller by Michael Crichton or Dan Brown following a plucky single doctor who fights hard for his patients, makes a breakthrough, and saves the day. That's not this book because that's definitely not what happened. The book starts off with a history of medicine. I had a vague idea about this beginning with Hypocrites and then jumping to those bleeders in Period dramas that announce, ""He's not long for this world."" with much in between. But there wasn't much in between and that's the problem.    While the other sciences moved in leaps and bounds medicine did not. There were lightbulbs and trains and the doctor was still coming to bleed you. Barry gives two reasons for this stagnation. The first is the anathema of autopsy. For the longest time it was simply unthinkable to cut into and examine a human being, it was too close to butchers work. Then there was a religious stigma attached but even in the twentieth century the liberal gods spoke out against it. Hell, even today hardened cops don't like attending autopsies.The second reason is a little trickier to understand - medicine is not logical like the other sciences. Barry gives an excellent example. A doctor in the early 1900s noticed that the face flushed during fever so he reasoned that fever could be a capillary issue. To test his theory he bled his fever patients. They went pale, their temperature dropped, and they were ravenous for food and drink. A cure! He published his finding, which was easily replicated, and was much lauded by the medical community. It was perfectly logical. It was wrong. Due to this reputation for butchery, witchery, and general ineffectiveness, being a doctor was not a respected profession. Medical schools were shockingly bad pass/fail systems where teacher salaries were based on butts in seats. Things changed quickly when they changed and you'll have to read the book to find out. This was the first book I read in 2016 and here I sit on the last evening of the year trying to finish this review. It was not mere procrastination; I was daunted by how much I enjoyed, learned, and was affected by this book. I became a vegetarian for four months and switched out all my beauty products to the more expensive cruelty free lines. And that was not even the point of the book. This entire review and I haven't even mentioned the word flu. Sigh. Just read it. *special thanks to my 2015 Secret Santa Krystal!"
189,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1649751-florence,4,"This is a very frightening book. We usually consider the flu to be a non life threatening disease. Not true in 1918. The disease killed millions in a worldwide pandemic. The actual number of fatalities can never be known because medical systems were so overwhelmed that many people were dying at home without ever seeing a medical professional. The grisly details of how ordinary people suffered are in this comprehensive book. Also covered are scientific descriptions of bacteria and viruses that a reader without a scientific background can comprehend. The pandemic seemed to be a perfect storm. President Woodrow Wilson was myopically focused on victory overseas as the Great War raged on. He made a fateful decision to send ailing troops to Europe, disregarding the advice of military health experts, exponentially expanding the disease to Europe. It took over 20 years to identify the virus that causes influenza. Initially it is transferred from an animal and has the diabolic ability to rapidly mutate to a form that can be spread among humans. Can a pandemic of this scope occur again? Almost certainly."
190,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/241691-kay,3,"""One always tends to overpraise a long book because one has got through it."" – E.M. ForsterIt took me the better part of the summer to listen to this audiobook in my car (I don't drive that much) -- and I confess that it soon became more of a chore than a pleasure. I do wish there had been a competently edited abridged version, for if ever a book cried out for editing, it was this one. Some of the book's strengths, however, include the exhaustive account of how the pandemic started and spread, not to mention the effect it had on society. There was a huge amount of material on how the authorities (mostly didn't) deal with the crisis, one of the key themes of the book being that in order to deal with such a threat that the civil authorities need to be completely honest about it. Point taken, but it was repeated over and over and over.... as were the somewhat melodramatic accounts of how the bodies stacked up, what having the disease was like, what the death toll was, and so on and so forth. Another strength was the intimate portraits of key researchers who rushed to find the cause of -- and a vaccine for -- the particularly virulent strain of influenza. There was a problem, though, in that the book's entire first section was a somewhat tedious historical account of the Johns Hopkins Institute. I'm still not sure why that was necessary (and suspect it wasn't). Granted, it was good to know what the state of medicine was at the turn of the century, but such an overview certainly could have been done more concisely. I also had real issues with the way several medical researchers, and in particular Paul Lewis, were cast into ""roles"" -- with Lewis the tragic figure that the author claimed was ""the last victim"" of the pandemic. Humph!However, I did find it fascinating to read about the details and design of medical research, and in particular how viruses mutated and became more or less deadly. In fact, I wished for a bit more of that information and less of the endless parade of statistics that Barry seemed so inordinately fond of. I came to believe that he had never met a statistic he didn't like (or subsequently use). Again, I was puzzled about why the editors hadn't intervened and winnowed out the repetitious material. Scott Brick, the reader for this book, was one of the biggest irritants, however, and no doubt significantly contributed to my feeling that the book was NEVER going to end. While his voice wasn't an unpleasant one, he seemed to have a very narrow ""range"" of intonation and emphasis. In fact, it sounded like he was overemphasizing just about everything, and he had a particular way of lingering over and stressing the word ""any"" that made me want to shriek after the first few hours. I had a hard time separating my irritation with his reading from my general impatience with the book, which is probably the reason I gave this three stars rather than two -- I'm not entirely sure whose fault it was that I didn't find this as interesting as I'd expected. (Plus, as Forster noted, one DOES tend to overpraise a long book that one finally manages to finish.) If I'd been reading this book rather than listening to it, undoubtedly I would have been able to skim pretty efficiently, slowing down for the parts that interested me the most and just skipping over the repetitive bits. But as a ""captive"" listener, it was pretty tough going. "
191,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/541670-caroline,2,"I had no less than four people come up to me while I was reading this book and tell me how great it was. Apparently it also made quite a splash at USAID when it was published. Maybe that's why three out of the four people who approached me were coworkers.It's possible these endorsements gave me unrealistic expectations, because by the time I finished it I was practically pulling my hair out. Which is a bummer because I was super excited to read The Great Influenza. I love books about medicine and medical history, so it wasn't the subject, it was what story author John Barry chose (tried?) to tell.An anecdote: Occasionally in high school, I would hit a particularly difficult calculus problem and seek out my mechanical engineer father for help. I'd show him the problem, perhaps a particularly pernicious related rate problem. Instead of starting from the problem itself, my dad always wanted to make sure I understood all of the individual concepts required to complete it. The running joke is that if I came to him with a calculus problem, he'd start no later in the material than the formal definition of a derivative and go from there. It would take several chapters worth of content before we arrived at the actual matter at hand. I still enjoy ribbing my dad about his approach to calculus assistance. He's sitting across the room from me right now and when I told him what I was writing he just grinned and declared ""First principles! You must build block by block on first principles!"" Hello, Dad who I've exaggerated for comedic effect, meet John M. Barry.John Barry started this book with Hippocrates and Galen. He then spent 166 pages getting from ancient Greece to the scientific revolution in American medicine that occurred in the early 20th century. He provides painstaking detail surrounding the creation of Johns Hopkins University (to be fair, this was pretty interesting, it's just... not the 1918 influenza pandemic). He introduces a small army of doctors, bacteriologists, and medical researchers, all of whom played a role in dragging medicine into the 20th century via the scientific method.Then, we have a mighty record scratch and Barry decides to spend about 200 pages on the 1918 epidemic itself. The majority of individuals introduced in the first section of the book take a backseat to an almost mind-numbing number of U.S. military cantonments, local and national politicians, and morbidity and mortality statistics. The level of detail is overwhelming and largely made my eyes glaze over. Frustratingly, this part of the book felt almost entirely disconnected from the medical history discussed earlier. Due to the severity of the pandemic, the carefully laboratory work according to the scientific method had to be discarded for shortcuts and best guesses. I figured Barry would highlight this irony and while he mentioned it a time or two, he for the most part just kept barreling forward through the history.Record scratch number two. With the end of the pandemic, we return to a smaller subset of the cast of characters discussed prior to its arrival and follow their lives and research down a number of paths that are only tangentially related (if at all) to influenza. Many of the most important individuals from the first part of the book are discarded without providing any sort of conclusion to their story.The whole thing was immensely aggravating. Whenever I look at a marble sculptures in art museums, I marvel at the fact that a sculptor was able to look at a block of stone, see the figure within, and get rid of the extra to reveal what was there all along. The Great Influenza felt like John M. Barry looking at a block of marble, seeing David, sculpting away, and instead revealing a figure with six arms, two heads, and feet erupting Alien-like from its chest. There are probably two and a half good books contained within, but Barry couldn't see what to get rid of and editor Wendy Wolf certainly didn't take a firm enough hand. I'm genuinely alarmed at the thought of what this book looked like pre-editor after reading the bloated and muddled final result. Here's the kicker: in the acknowledgements, John Barry pulls back the curtain on the process of writing the book and fully reveals his obliviousness. Get a load of this:""This book was initially supposed to be a straightforward story of the deadliest epidemic in human history, told from the perspectives of both scientists who tried to fight it and political leaders who tried to respond to it. I though it would take me two and a half years to write, three at the most. That plan didn't work. Instead this book took seven years to write. It has evolved (and, I hope, grown) into something rather different than originally conceived.""NO JOHN, THE NEW PLAN PLAN DIDN'T WORK. YOU SHOULD HAVE STUCK WITH THE ORIGINAL. Seven years. Holy crud.Other nits to pick: I often felt like Barry had an agenda to push. At various times in the book, he would stake out rather extreme positions and seemed to only approach the history from that angle, with Wilson's approach to World War I and the U.S. military's approach to the pandemic being two of the major examples. Were either perfect? Certainly not, but Barry seemed almost to cast them as the villains of the influenza pandemic, a practice I found unhelpful. I was also distinctly uncomfortable with an insinuation Barry made about the death of Paul A. Lewis. Implying suicide shouldn't be thrown around without evidence, and Barry provided nothing concrete. Not cool, dude.The writing is also nothing to write home about. Barry has an annoying habit of repeating anecdotes throughout the book and if I see the sentence ""It was influenza, only influenza"" one more time, I might scream.It's probably 1.5 stars but I'm rounding up. So why two instead of one? I did learn some things and a number of individual threads in the book were interesting. Highlights include a better understanding of why Johns Hopkins has the reputation it does, what the Hs and Ns are in influenza (ex: the H1N1 strain), and the word enzootic*.In all honesty, though, I'd probably pass on this one. You can learn the bulk of the 1918 influenza-specific stuff more quickly and enjoyably via Wikipedia. *It is to animals what the word ""epidemic"" is to humans, which makes sense given the roots. I'm distinctly less excited about it now, though, having just looked up the pronunciation and realized that it is pronounced en-zoh-AH-tic instead of en-ZOO-tic. I suppose you can't win them all."
192,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3244513-mike,4,"Overall this was a very good book. Expansive, thorough, and at times utterly fascinating. I'm sure people around me are completely sick of me talking about the flu at this point but this is that kind of book that will do that to you. It falls short of getting five stars for a couple of reasons, some of which are about the book but most of which are about me as a reader:1. It's almost too expansive: In Barry's quest to explore every possible nook and cranny of the 1918 Influenza pandemic he leaves no scientific idea or historical actor unearthed and thoroughly discussed. This lends to a skater shot feel to the book as you lurch from one person to another in chronological order with whole chapters about the science of viruses and bacteria popping up here and there to interrupt the forward momentum of the story. I feel like I got a about a dozen very short, somewhat shallow, biographies in this one book and a bit more science that I really wanted. 2. Lack of a supporting personal story or strong main character: When I contrast this book with Steven Johnson's ""Ghost Map"", which is all about John Snow and how he dealt with a cholera outbreak in London in the 19th Century, I find that it didn't hold my attention all the time because I didn't really connect with any of the people in the book or feel like there was a broad narrative that was pulling me along. Sure, he does a good job of showing how the pandemic began, how it peaks, and how it ebbs but the pandemic is far too amorphous for me to really relate to. And while he clearly shows how many of the people in the book react at these different phases I didn't really feel like I got to know any of them with the kind of detail that Johnson pulled out of John Snow.3. Hey, you got your science book in my history book! No, you got your history book in my science book! Wow, they're two great genres that kind of make for a confusing mess when you put them all together: Okay, this gripe is all about me as a reader. I'm WAY more interested in history and politics than science. Unless the science is about robots, zombies, or space ships at a certain point I kind of just zone out. Barry, at times, gets super deep on the science of influenza explaining in great detail how it infects the body and causes no end of problems. While it is a great feat of writing to talk about that sort of thing without losing the reader (to his credit it was never confusing) it doesn't make for a compelling read for me. When Barry talks about history in this book it's completely riveting, I literally couldn't put it down, but then there would be a speed bump science chapter and I'd have to slog through it to get back to the ideas that were the most interesting to me. It made for a frustrating read at times.Over all I would highly recommend this book. It really was quite good, my gripes aside. And, frankly, the historical implications of the book make it worth the read alone (namely that at a crucial junction in the negotiation of the Treaty of Versailles at the end of World War I Pres. Wilson came down with the flu and it, for a bunch of reasons, left him possibly permanently mentally impaired - he believed from that point on that French spies had infiltrated the White House for example - is shocking. Given that that treaty is often held directly responsible for the rise of Nazi Germany, and World War II, and that the principle features of that treaty may have caused the rise of the Nazi's were almost all pushed by the French and opposed by Pres. Wison, until his bought with the flu that is, one is left believing if not for the flu the world could have been very different). If you like science and enjoy history I think this would be a very satisfying reading experience.As an aside, I gave this book to my Grandmother for Christmas in 2009 when she was 91 years old. She and I developed a pattern late in her life of me giving her books that I'd read that I liked for birthdays and Christmas. She was an avid reader and game to read anything, although like me her preferences were more inclined to history, biography, and travel. This was one of the rare books I gave her without reading first. When I asked her, on Christmas 2011, to lend me one of her favorite books she gave me this one. She was born in April of 1918, near the beginning of this book, and I think for her the book explained a lot of things people would mention in her childhood that never made much sense (relatives who died during the flu, particular idioms people would use, or beliefs they had about sickness). She died in March of 2012 just a month shy of 94. In reading this book I am profoundly impressed by her intelligence. This book is not an easy read in spots (there were sections I read twice) and for someone who didn't even finish high school to read this book and not only understand it but enjoy it is a testament to the amazing person she was. This book still has the post-it note she always put on the inside front cover of books she got as gifts with the date, occasion, and person(s) who gave it to her. While she may be gone it makes me happy that she and I could at least share this one last experience together. "

195,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/611813-melinda,4,"Re-reading again in 2020 in the middle of the coronavirus outbreak.This is an excellent book. Reading it in the time of Coronavirus is eye-opening. I wish that the shrill shrieking gerbils of the media would provide comparisons ""per population"" for their numbers, and also comparisons with the traditional flu. The 2nd half of the book is especially worthwhile in this time of pandemic.********I highly recommend this book! It reads like a ""who-done-it"", except that you know who did it (the influenza virus) and you are watching the medical scientists struggle to find solutions while the wild-fire of the 1918 influenza pandemic raged all around them. Will they find a solution in time? (see the bottom paragraph for an answer to this question)Before documenting the path of the 1918 influenza, the author lays the groundwork for the transformed medical atmosphere from the late 1800's into the early 1900's in America. This path thus shows the beginnings of the the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research, the Phipps Institute, and Johns Hopkins University. Names of medical pioneers and influenza warriors such as Paul Lewis (who proved that polio was caused by a virus in 1907 and developed a vaccine that was 100% effective in protecting monkeys), William Henry Welch (the single most powerful individual in the history of American medicine, who directed the rise of Johns Hopkins University, and who with John D. Rockefeller Jr. created the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research, arguablly the best scientific research institute in the world), Simon Flexner (first head of the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research, the man who brought the mortality rate for common bacterial meningitis down to 18% in 1919 WITHOUT antibiotics!), Rufus Cole (who made the Rockefeller Institute Hospital a model for the way clinical research is conducted), Army Surgeon General William Gorgas (whose work in abating the transmission of yellow fever and malaria by controlling the mosquitos saved hundreds of thousands of lives, and allowed construction on the Panama Canal), Oswald Avery (whose work on influenza would lead him to one of the most important scientific discoveries in the 20th century, that DNA is the material of which genes and chromosomes are made), Anna Wessel Williams (the leading female bacteriologist in the world who worked hand in hand with William Park trying to develop a serum or vaccine for influenza),William Park (teamed with Anna Wessel Williams, developed the diptheria antitoxin still in use today), andRichard Shope (who as the first to prove that a virus caused influenza) fill the pages of this book. After setting the stage with its influenza warriors and medical laboratories, the author then begins the saga of the influenza virus itself. Influenza struck in the first wave in the winter and spring of 1918, a mild ""three day fever"" form that most recovered from. The second wave hit in the fall of 1918. This wave was the most virulent and deadly. The third wave hit somewhere in the winter / spring of 1919, and was once again a less virulent form. In just 2 years the virus mutated into a super killer, then back into a more mild disease. In raw numbers, the lowest estimate of the worldwide death toll at the time was 20 million. Knowing what we know now, epidemiologists today estimate that influenza caused at least 50 million and possibly 100 million deaths worldwide. All that in a time when the population of the world was 1/3rd of what it is today. The terrifying aspect of the super killer influenza was that it did not strike the traditional victims... the old and the very young, but instead hit hardest in the age group of 20's and 30's. If the upper estimate of 100 million deaths is accurate, then 8 to 10 percent of all young adults then living were killed by the virus.And these deaths happened with blinding speed. The influenza pandemic stretched out over 2 years. But 2/3rds of the deaths occurred in a period of 24 weeks. That is about 66 million deaths in 24 weeks. Averaged out that would be 2.5 million deaths per week. Yet more than half of those 66 million deaths happened from mid-September to early December of 1918. That is really 33 million deaths in 10 to 12 weeks! That's 3.3 MILLION deaths PER WEEK in the late fall and early winter of 1918! And remember that the world population at the time was less than 1/3rd of what it is today (which is 6.8 billion people). The numbers are just staggering, and I had to keep reading them and figuring out the numbers and it still is a staggering thought. So many died in so short a time! Epidemiological evidence from the work of Dr. Loring Miner seems to show that the new influenza virus originated in Haskell County, Kansas early in the winter of 1918. Dr. Miner documented early cases of the new influenza that showed disturbing mortality rates in a very short period of time. The virus then went to a huge army base in the eastern part of the state as troops were gathered in preparation for their deployment to Europe for WWI. From that army base, soliders were sent to France, soldiers were transferred to other bases in the United States....and the disease began sweeping through North America, Europe, South America, Asia, Africa, and the entire world. Some situations requiring fast decision making in chaotic circumstances were carried out well. Other situations were not handled as well. The ins and outs of these crossing paths of decisions, deaths mounting rapidly, politics, mililtary directives, and newly formed medical laboratories make up the rest of the book. The story is staggering, but gripping. In answer to the question at the beginning of this review, the answer is ""no, the medical scientists did not find a solution during the time of the 1918 thru 1920 influenza pandemic"". They learned alot, yes. They also learned that the only way to be protected from the disease was through isolation from it. Medical practices helping and treating the ill were improved, but a vaccine was never been found. The only reason the killing influenza stopped killing was because it mutated away from the more virulent form into a milder form. So the question immediately to ask is ""what happens if the virus mutates back to the virulent form?"". And that is the question we are left with at the end of the book. In the concluding chapter, the author raises these issues and concludes tentatively that in pandemic times, an authorized power (government, World Health Organization, army, someone) must have the authority to act and to act quickly, and their decisions must trump individual freedoms. Mandatory vaccinations, mandatory quaranatine, mandatory travel restrictions are the things that must be done to protect the larger population. The ""needs of the many outweigh the needs of the one"", if I may quote a Star Trek movie. In times of such overwhelming medical need, quick decisions must be made and sometimes they must be harsh."

In the present there is a virulent influenza outbreak and in the past there is the plague sweeping through England. This book deals with the deadliest outbreak of virulent influenza so far which, at the time, was often thought to be a form of plague (because of extreme cyanosis). Neat, tie-in huh? (hide spoiler)]"
197,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4118002-jeanne,4,"The Great Influenza is a sobering story, especially in today’s climate. This well-researched book gives a detailed account of why this deadly pandemic devastated the world. A well-written history."
198,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10978428-jim,4,"The bodies were piling up. The undertakers, themselves falling sick, were overwhelmed. There was no place to put the bodies. Gravediggers were either sick or refused to bury the influenza victims. Caskets were stacking up...then they ran short of caskets. The city morgue filled up. The stench was terrible...this was Philadelphia, October 1918, the time of the so-called ""Spanish flu."" Barry gives us a panoramic view of the most lethal influenza outbreak in history which occurred in 1918-1919. Today we believe that the death toll in the United States was 675,000 out of a population of 105 million. As many as 100 million died worldwide out of a global population of 1.8 billion, more than 5% of the world's population.  Barry follows the movement of the flu virus across the world, starting in rural Kansas, where somehow the virus crossed the animal-human barrier (from chickens?). It erupted in an Army camp in Kansas and moved east with the soldiers and then went on the troopships with them to Europe...It came in three waves, that first wave that hit the soldiers in the spring of 1918 was rather mild. But then in the fall, there was the second wave that was much more virulent--that's when most of the deaths occurred. Then the virus mutated again and there was a third wave which hit places like Australia--which had not been hit so hard by the second wave. Much of the book is involved with the story of the scientists battling the virus. Barry goes into some detail about this and focuses on some key figures. As he explains, a revolution had occurred in American medicine where labs had been organized and work was going on with the expectation that disease could be conquered by modern science. When it came to the great influenza, science failed. We are still living with the consequences of that.  The book was published in 2004 and, in it, Barry warns that we will face another pandemic. It's only a question of when. He states that we are NOT prepared for a pandemic. The events of this year of 2020 shows that he was right."
199,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6949571-thomas-paul,5,"It killed more people in 6 months than the Black Death killed in a century. People who were young and strong were the most likely to die. In the US, 650,000 people died. The average life expectancy in the US went down by 10 years. Worldwide, perhaps 100 million people died. And yet, it was only the flu. Even today, 90 years after the epidemic, it kills 36,000 Americans in a typical year and we are hardly more prepared to face another epidemic.John M. Barry has written a fascinating account of the influenza epidemic of 1918. But the book is a lot more than just a review of the flu. Barry starts out by examining the state of the American health system at the time of the epidemic and how it reached that state. He explores the revolutionary changes to medicine that occurred in the late 19th and early 20th century and the people who led those changes. He shows us why, even today, a cure for influenza is beyond our reach, explaining in layman’s terms how the influenza virus changes to become deadly and changes again to lose that deadliness. He explains how an endemic virus can lead to an epidemic of unimagined proportions.Barry also shows how the demands of World War I on troop movements, the propaganda campaigns to keep morale high, and the failure of leaders to listen to the doctors and researchers led to a killing field of historic size. His account tends to concentrate on Philadelphia because the city was hit extremely hard and much of the research going on was near that city but he does cover other areas around the world hit hard by the virus, although his coverage of the flu outside of the US is sketchy at best. He gives us writings from diaries and newspaper articles to show what was actually happening and how the media tried to downplay the epidemic. He gives us detailed accounts of the research (and the researchers) that was done to fight the epidemic, explains why this research was mostly unsuccessful, and does it all in a way that is easy to understand even if you don’t have a medical degree.Barry likes to use foreshadowing, hints of what is to come, to keep the reader’s interest and it does work, even if it is a bit melodramatic. Even the chapter titles, “The Tinderbox”, “It Begins”, The Race”, provide some melodrama to the story. The book mostly moves at a good pace and I found myself having trouble putting it down. Barry has written a book that everyone should read, whether you are familiar with the epidemic or not. It is a fascinating, terrifying, detailed, and extremely important book."
200,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8298053-colleen-browne,3,"This book starts out with a summary of medicine from Hippocrates to the First World War. That seems like it would be a long slog but because there was so little advancement during that time, it is done fairly quickly. As a reader with very limited knowledge of the history of medicine, I found this very interesting. What I didn't know at the beginning of the book was that the better part of the book was spent with the author going off on tangents only peripherally related to the pandemic. There is a great deal of information in this book, too much information. This book could have done with a good editor. The length of the book was about the same length as most of the books I read, and in many cases, much shorter but it didn't feel that way. It felt much longer. Barry's use of metaphor was helpful in explaining his subject and his style of writing wasn't awful as many reviewers have charged but he didn't seem to know when to stop on those threads that he followed out to what felt like oblivion at times. This is the first book I have read devoted to the subject (and may be the last). I could not recommend this book; at least not to anyone just interested in the pandemic. I can only suppose that there are better books on the topic."

203,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68316850-gavin,3,"Rousing history of one of the worst things that has ever happened: the 1918 outbreak of H1N1 flu. It focusses particularly on the great scientists who tried to fight it, none of whom I'd ever heard of. Also a meditation on epistemology, the modern mind, & the redemptive meaning of science for beasts like us.Barry senses that the headline result - one-third of the entire world infected, with 
25-100
 million dead - doesn't get enough of a rise from us. The numbers are numbing. So he couches it in modern shocking terms:
 It killed more people in twenty-four weeks than AIDS has killed in twenty-four years, more in a year than the Black Death killed in a century.
Or ten thousand 9/11s. It's worth belabouring this, because we have a weird habit of paying far more attention to human threats than natural ones, even when natural ones are far worse. (Witness our terrorism prevention budgets compared to our infectious disease control budgets, when the latter is a thousand times more lethal.)So: The 1918 flu was worse than the entire First World War: 40+ million died of flu compared with 17 million dead from war; 500 million lives damaged by flu vs 41 million lives by war. 3% of everyone alive died of flu, including about 8% of young adults(!).Except it's hard to separate the War and the pandemic. The virus was spread everywhere by unprecedented numbers of troops, and by the massive supply convoys it induced, and by the War's other human displacements. We don't know how many of the pneumonia deaths only occurred because of the logistical degradation, poverty and pestilence of wartime. There are terrible nonlinearities involved in overcrowding and global movement of troops. But add millions at least to the overall death toll caused by WWI.The book is in the epic mode, all the way through. (That's not a straightforward compliment.) I liked it, but I understand if it's a bit American for you:
Man might be defined as “modern” largely to the extent that he attempts to control nature. In this relationship with nature, modern humanity has generally been the aggressor, and a daring one at that, altering the flow of rivers, building upon geological faults, and, today, even engineering the genes of existing species. Nature has generally been languid in its response, although contentious once aroused and occasionally displaying a flair for violence.By 1918 humankind was fully modern, and fully scientific, but too busy fighting itself to aggress against nature. Nature, however, chooses its own moments. It chose this moment to aggress against man, and it did not do so prodding languidly. For the first time, modern humanity, a humanity practicing the modern scientific method, would confront nature in its fullest rage.
There's a long prelude describing how terrible medicine was up to the 20th Century. Medicine was ""the withered arm of science"". Therapeutic nihilism (that is, ""we can't really do anything"") was the only rational view, replacing millenia of Galenic woo.
Stengel reviewed dozens of ideas advanced in medical journals. Gargles of various disinfectants. Drugs. Immune sera. Typhoid vaccine. Diphtheria antitoxin. But Stengel’s message was simple: This doesn’t work. That doesn’t work. Nothing worked... Nothing they were doing worked.
Problem is, this rational scepticism created a powerful vacuum: humans need to believe something can heal, and the gap was filled with worse. Some confabulated gremlins from this time haunt us still: homeopathy, chiropractic, naturopathy, Christian Science, and (though Barry doesn't include them) the organic farming movement and psychoanalysis.Few people come off well. Even among the scientists, we get a horrible example of perverse priors and premature updating: an enormous proportion of all scientific resources were devoted to fighting the wrong pathogen, due to a bad guess by an extremely eminent researcher.Because so much of the state was occupied in war, in places there was wholesale social collapse:
In Philadelphia meanwhile fear came and stayed. Death could come from anyone, anytime. People moved away from others on the sidewalk, avoided conversation; if they did speak, they turned their faces away to avoid the other person’s breathing. The impossibility of getting help compounded the isolation. 850 Philadelphia doctors and more nurses were away in the military. More than that number were sick. Philadelphia General Hospital had 126 nurses. Despite all precautions, despite wearing surgical masks and gowns, eight doctors and fifty-four nurses—43 percent of the staff—themselves required hospitalization. Ten nurses at this single hospital died. The Board of Health pleaded for help from retired nurses and doctors if they remembered “even a little” of their profession.When a nurse or doctor or policeman did actually come, they wore their ghostly surgical masks, and people fled them. In every home where someone was ill, people wondered if the person would die. And someone was ill in every home...Starr went to Emergency Hospital #2 at Eighteenth and Cherry Streets. He did have help, if it could be called that, from an elderly physician who had not practiced in years and who brought Starr into touch with the worst of heroic medicine. Starr wouldn’t forget that, the ancient arts of purging, of venesection, the ancient art of opening a patient’s vein. But for the most part he and the other students elsewhere were on their own, with little help even from nurses, who were so desperately needed that in each of ten emergency hospitals supplied by the Red Cross only a single qualified nurse was available to oversee whatever women came as volunteers. And often the volunteers reported for their duty once and, from either fear or exhaustion, did not come again.Nearly 1/4 of all the patients in his hospital died each day. Starr would go home, and when he returned the next day, he would find that between one-quarter and one-fifth of the patients in the hospital had died, replaced by new ones... Virtually all of them, along with their friends and relatives, were terrified that, no matter how mild the symptoms seemed at first, within them moved an alien force, a seething, spreading infection, a live thing with a will that was taking over their bodies — and could be killing them...The city was frozen with fear, frozen into stillness. Starr lived 12 miles from the hospital. The streets were silent on his drive home, silent. They were so silent he took to counting the cars he saw. One night he saw no cars at all. He thought, “The life of the city had almost stopped.”
Everyone can read the collapse of official power in Philadelphia as supporting their politics. Anarchists can point to the benevolent spontaneous order that arose after the corrupt local government failed to act; libertarians can point out that this spontaneous order was all funded by the richest Philadelphians; statists can point out that, without actually-authoritative co-ordination, the effort eventually failed, because people defected against each other, in fear.
The corpses had backed up at undertakers’, filling every area of these establishments and pressing up into living quarters; in hospital morgues overflowing into corridors; in the city morgue overflowing into the street. And they had backed up in homes. They lay on porches, in closets, in corners of the floor, on beds. Children would sneak away from adults to stare at them, to touch them; a wife would lie next to a dead husband, unwilling to move him or leave him. The corpses, reminders of death and bringers of terror or grief, lay under ice at Indian-summer temperatures. Their presence was constant, a horror demoralizing the city; a horror that could not be escaped. Finally the city tried to catch up to them.The police wore their ghostly surgical masks, and people fled them, but the masks had no effect on the viruses and by mid-October thirty-three policemen had died, with many more to follow... More coffins came by rail, guarded by men with guns.
""There is, therefore, but one response possible from us: Force! force to the utmost, force without stint or limit, the righteous and triumphant force which shall make right the law of the world and cast every selfish dominion down in the dust. ""- Woodrow Wilson addressing one of his money-lending mobs.Wilson tends to be viewed pretty positively, just because he won. (""at last the world knows America as the savior of the world!"") But he perverted an entire state and nation to do so, ignored the terrible suffering of his own damn population for years, and refused a conditional peace with Austria in August and with the Kaiser's new parliament in September. (This meant 30-70 extra days of war, which, if this period was as lethal as the rest of the war, means up to 800,000 completely unnecessary deaths, not to mention the continuing waste of resources during the worst epidemic ever). Wilson did great evil, was not much different from the Kaiser, the election aside.
 the military suctioned more and more nurses and physicians into cantonments, aboard ships, into France, until it had extracted nearly all the best young physicians. Medical care for civilians deteriorated rapidly. The doctors who remained in civilian life were largely either incompetent young ones or those over forty-five years of age, the vast majority of whom had been trained in the old ways of medicine. 
Barry's middle chapters are a frightening portrait of how rabidly un-American the US was in 1918. The laws were bad enough - for instance the ban on criticising the government. But then there's the unofficial ""patriotic duties"", punishable by beatings. State-sponsored atavism.
By the summer of 1918, however, Wilson had injected the government into every facet of national life and had created great bureaucratic engines to focus all the nation’s attention and intent on the war.He had created a Food Administration to control and distribute food, a Fuel Administration to ration coal and gasoline, a War Industries Board to oversee the entire economy. He had taken all but physical control over the railroads and had created a federally sponsored river barge line that brought commerce back to life on the Mississippi River, a commerce that had been killed by competition from those railroads. He had built many dozens of military installations, each of which held at least tens of thousands of soldiers or sailors. He had created industries that made America’s shipyards teem with hundreds of thousands of laborers launching hundreds of ships, dug new coal mines to produce coal for the factories that weaned America’s military from British and French weapons and munitions—for, unlike in World War II, America was no arsenal of democracy.He had created a vast propaganda machine, an internal spy network, a bond-selling apparatus... He had even succeeded in stifling speech, in the summer of 1918 arresting and imprisoning — some for prison terms longer than ten years —not just radical labor leaders and editors of German-language newspapers but powerful men, even a congressman.He had injected the government into American life in ways unlike any other in the nation’s history. And the final extension of federal power had come only in the spring of 1918, after the first wave of influenza had begun jumping from camp to camp, when the government expanded the draft from males between the ages of twenty-one and thirty to those between the ages of eighteen and forty-five. Only on May 23, 1918, had Provost Marshal Enoch Crowder, who oversaw the draft, issued his “work or fight” order, stating that anyone not employed in an essential industry would be drafted...Crowder bragged about doing “in a day what the Prussian autocracy had been spending nearly fifty years to perfect...""In mid-August, as the lethal wave of the epidemic was gathering itself, Austria had already inquired about peace terms, an inquiry that Wilson rebuffed utterly. And as the epidemic was gathering full momentum, peace was only weeks away. Bulgaria had signed an armistice on September 29. On September 30, Kaiser Wilhelm had granted parliamentary government to the German nation; that same day Ludendorff had warned his government that Germany must extend peace feelers or disaster—immediate disaster—would follow. German diplomats sent out those feelers. Wilson ignored them. The Central Powers, Germany and her allies, were simultaneously breaking off one from one another and disintegrating internally as well. In the first week of October, Austria and Germany separately sent peace feelers to the Allies, and on October 7, Austria delivered a diplomatic note to Wilson formally seeking peace on any terms Wilson chose. Ten days later — days of battle and deaths — the Austrian note remained unanswered.Earlier Wilson had spoken of a “peace without victory,” believing only such a peace could last. But now he gave no indication that the war would soon be over. Although a rumor that the war had ended sent thrills through the nation, Wilson quickly renounced it. Nor would he relent. He was not now fighting to the death; he was fighting only to kill...If Wilson and his government would not be turned from his end even by the prospect of peace, they would hardly be turned by a virus. And the reluctance, inability, or outright refusal of the American government to shift targets would contribute to the killing. Wilson took no public note of the disease, and the thrust of the government was not diverted. The relief effort for influenza victims would find no assistance in the Food Administration or the Fuel Administration or the Railroad Administration. From neither the White House nor any other senior administration post would there come any leadership, any attempt to set priorities, any attempt to coordinate activities, any attempt to deliver resources....the military would give no help to civilians. Instead it would draw further upon civilian resources. The same day that Welch had stepped out of the autopsy room at Devens and called Gorgas’s office, his warning had been relayed to the army chief of staff, urging that all transfers be frozen unless absolutely necessary and that under no circumstances transfers from infected camps be made... Gorgas’s superiors ignored the warning. There was no interruption of movement between camps whatsoever; not until weeks later, with the camps paralyzed and, literally, tens of thousands of soldiers dead or dying, did the army make any adjustments.
Because the disease was everywhere, ravaging the entire species (and beyond), the book can't cover everything. Very little is said about non-Americans, i.e about 98% of the death and chaos. This is partly because there just isn't a lot of evidence about them, despite their influenza immunity and medical care being even worse. (This is why the top estimates reach 100m deaths, three times the median estimate.) Here is a passage about just a tiny number of them, in the north:
In Alaska, whites protected themselves. Sentries guarded all trails, and every person entering the city was quarantined for five days. Eskimos had no such luck. A senior Red Cross official warned that without “immediate medical assistance the race” could become “extinct.”...The navy provided the collier USS Brutus to carry a relief expedition... They found terrible things. One doctor visited ten tiny villages and found “three wiped out entirely; others average 85% deaths… Survivors generally children… probably 25% frozen to death before help arrived.”The virus probably did not kill all of them directly. But it struck so suddenly it left no one well enough to care for any others, no one to get food, no one to get water. And those who could have survived, surrounded by bodies, bodies of people they loved, might well have preferred to go where their family had gone, might well have wanted to no longer be alone... Two hundred sixty-six people had lived in Okak, and many dogs, dogs nearly wild. When the virus came, it struck so hard so fast people could not care for themselves or feed the dogs. The dogs grew hungry, crazed with hunger, devoured each other, then wildly smashed through windows and doors, and fed... In all of Labrador, at least one-third the total population died. 
---Barry commits at least one big error: he's horrified by the medical schools of the time having ""no standards for admission"":
 In research and education especially, American medicine lagged far behind [European medicine]... At least one hundred US medical schools would accept any man willing to pay tuition... and only a single medical school required its student to have a college degree... the Johns Hopkins itself, not student fees, paid [its] faculty salaries, and it required medical students to have not only a college degree but fluency in French and German and a background of science courses. 
But his enthusiasm for Johns Hopkins introducing the college degree requirement is misplaced. Contemporary US doctors (who all have 3 years of pre-med, or even more college, before they start medical training) are probably no better clinicians than undergraduate doctors in other countries, and are far further in debt. This requirement is probably one reason the American system is so fucked.I suppose Barry is just confusing the open admissions situation with the schools' appallingly low graduation standards, which is certainly one reason eC20th medicine sucked. (Many doctors had never looked down a microscope, never used a stethoscope on a patient, never seen a dissection.)---PS: Mostly unimportant corrections by a virologist here.

Bush read this book shortly after it was published and was so impressed by the threat of future pandemics that he commissioned a department whose sole function was to prepare for future pandemics. This involved cooperation by federal, state and international entities (such as the WHO) to set up surveillance networks for potentially deadly diseases and to stockpile drugs and equipment such as mechanical ventilators that could be used in the event of a sharp spike in the number of inpatient hospitalizations. Unfortunately, the current president quickly defunded and essentially disbanded all of President Bush's efforts to prepare for what scientists and even foresighted politicians knew was inevitable. In his book, Barry wrote of the things that people did to protect themselves in 1918-19 and recommendations for what we could do when the next pandemic occurred. There was actually very few differences between the two lists: masks, hand-washing, social distancing and the cancelling of large gatherings being prominent on both lists. Barry asserted that our greatest chance of preventing a full-scale calamity lay in forethought and preparation. We will never know if that would have had much of an impact. When Barry wrote this book he likely couldn't have foreseen the political situation the U.S. finds itself in today but he knew politicians. He knew that in order to avoid boosting the enemy's morale in wartime, our leaders refused to speak honestly about the seriousness of the influenza pandemic and, as a result, millions died. But if he thought that politicians today were any better, he likely wouldn't have written in the afterward of one edition ""On a larger scale, and far more difficult, will be getting governments to tell the truth about the disease. This is perhaps the biggest lesson about 1918 and it is a lesson not yet learned.""I try to avoid revealing spoilers in my reviews but these are unusual times and I think that the best way to close this review is to let Barry do it for me. Here are the closing paragraphs in this magnificent work:
So the final lesson of 1918, a simple one yet one most difficult to execute, is that those who occupy positions of authority must lessen the panic that can alienate all within a society. Society cannot function if it is every man for himself. By definition, civilization cannot survive that. Those in authority must retain the public’s trust. The way to do that is to distort nothing, to put the best face on nothing, to try to manipulate no one. Lincoln said that first, and best. A leader must make whatever horror exists concrete. Only then will people be able to break it apart.

206,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4739424-mal-warwick,5,"A century ago a pandemic disease far more lethal than COVID-19 killed an estimated fifty to one hundred million people around the world—as many as one out of every twenty people then alive. The 1918 flu epidemic erupted during a war that had already killed tens of millions and at a time when medical science was far less accomplished than it is today. Although there are lessons to learn for our response to COVID-19, it’s important to view what happened then in its historical context. And that’s the approach John M. Barry so brilliantly takes in The Great Influenza. This engrossing book may well be one of the very best ever written on medical history.The historical context of the 1918 flu epidemicAs Barry makes clear, medical science had taken big steps forward in the decades before the pandemic erupted, especially in the United States. Half a century earlier, German researchers, and French to a lesser extent, led the world in medical research. However, by the outbreak of World War I, two institutions had spearheaded immense advances in American medicine: Johns Hopkins Hospital and the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research (later Rockefeller University).Johns Hopkins Hospital, founded in 1889, had been established expressly to bring the scientific method into the teaching and practice of medicine in the United States. The Rockefeller Institute set out from day one to become the world’s most important medical research institution, and many observers have expressed the opinion that it succeeded very shortly after its establishment in 1901. Barry traces the evolution of both Johns Hopkins and the Rockefeller (as they were then known) through in-depth sketches of the prominent physicians who led them. Those doctors, the heroes of the tale, played leadership roles in combating the 1918 flu epidemic, advising the military and government at all levels on precautionary measures and researching the origins of the disease and possible treatment. Unfortunately, they made little headway in either respect.Why the disease spread so widely and so quicklyThe doctors’ increasingly strident insistence on warning the public about the epidemic were met with rigid resistance until hundreds of thousands of Americans had already died. The Wilson administration had instituted draconian measures to prevent any news from reaching the public that would turn its attention from the need to support the war effort. Although press censorship was not in force, the nation’s press almost uniformly self-censored, parroting the official line that the disease was not serious while bodies piled up in the morgues. The result then, as it is today in the COVID-19 pandemic, was that those who denied the problem lost the public’s trust. But the biggest reason the influenza spread so widely and so quickly was the insistence of the US Army on transferring troops in large numbers from one base to another in crowded trains and then overseas in crowded ships.The 1918 flu epidemic was “the deadliest pandemic in history”Although up to five percent of the world’s population—and “as many as 8 to 10 percent of all young adults then living—died from the so-called “Spanish influenza,” its impact was not limited to the appalling death toll. Naturally, the pandemic greatly influenced the course of medical research and the adoption of public health measures far more widely than had been the case. But its consequences were far-reaching both in the conduct of World War I and in the shape of the peace that emerged from the conflict. Barry skillfully explores both themes in The Great Influenza.How the epidemic helped defeat GermanyIn April 1918, German commander Erich Ludendorff began “his last great offensive—Germany’s last real chance to win the war. The . . . offensive made great initial gains.” But then it stalled. Barry quotes the diary of a US Army surgeon stationed near the front: “‘The expected third phase of the great German offensive gets put off from day to day . . . I gather that the epidemic of grippe which hit us rather hard in Flanders also hit the Boche worse, and this may have caused the delay.'” In fact, Ludendorff himself “blamed influenza for the loss of initiative and the ultimate failure of the offensive.” No single battle necessarily changes the course of any war (although Midway, Stalingrad, and the Normandy Invasion are all claimed to have done just that in the next war.) But contemporary observers in 1918, and military analysts now, seem to agree that however slim the likelihood that Germany might end up victorious was certainly then lost.How the 1918 flu epidemic helped cause World War IIHistorians agree that the Treaty of Versailles that brought World War I to a close was a disaster. The excessive pain it imposed on Germany is almost universally acknowledged to have led in virtually a straight line to the Second World War. Yet that treaty took the form it did only because, midway through the peace conference, the world’s most popular statesman, Woodrow Wilson, suddenly and unaccountably “abandoned principles he had previously insisted upon. He yielded to [French Prime Minister Georges] Clemenceau everything of significance Clemenceau wanted, virtually all of which Wilson had earlier opposed.” Clemenceau was the primary architect of the harsh provisions incorporated into the treaty.Most accounts of Wilson’s strange turnabout at Versailles ascribe it to a minor stroke he suffered. The President was, in fact, in his sickbed when he made the fateful decision. However, Barry cites powerful evidence that Wilson had not in fact suffered a stroke. He had the flu. “Wilson’s actual symptoms—including high fever, severe coughing, and total prostration, [were] all symptoms that perfectly fit influenza and have no association whatsoever with stroke . . . Indeed, the virus may have contributed to the [severe] stroke” Wilson suffered much later that incapacitated him and led to his death.Where the “Spanish flu” really originatedWithin months of its appearance in the United States, the 1918 flu epidemic quickly went pandemic throughout Western Europe. The “Great War” was in its final months at the time, and rigid press censorship was in force on both sides of the trenches. Thus, even though thousands of American, French, British, and German troops were falling ill throughout the war zone, no news about their plight reached the home front in any one of the combatant countries. Neutral Spain, however, was different. There, alarmist reports about the virulence of the fast-spreading disease were splashed all over front pages. And that was how the epidemic came to be dubbed the “Spanish flu.”In fact, as Barry reports in detail, the deadly strain of H1N1 influenza at the heart of the 1918 flu epidemic almost certainly originated in Haskell County, Kansas, early that year. From there, the disease made its way eastward to a huge army “cantonment” where tens of thousands of troops were preparing to be shipped to France as cannon fodder for “Black Jack” Pershing‘s push against the German lines. Tens of thousands never made it there, falling victim instead to the flu. And, in carrying the disease to Europe, they triggered its spread to both Allied and enemy troops as well as civilian populations throughout Western Europe and ultimately to the rest of the world.How the 1918 flu epidemic was different from COVID-19In two major respects, the pandemic of a century ago differed significantly from what we are experiencing as I write:** Influenza is a respiratory disease that primarily attacks the lungs, nose, and throat. When it kills, it does so primarily through pneumonia. Although COVID-19 was initially feared to be similar in its effects, it is in truth a vascular disease that manifests through the circulatory system. ** It’s difficult for scientists to calculate the mortality (death) rate of a disease. But it is clear that the H1N1 influenza virus that emerged in 1918 was far more lethal than the COVID-19 strains that have been seen to date. Hundreds of thousands are dying today. Eventually, it seems likely that globally millions will do so. But it seems highly unlikely that the death toll will rise into the tens of millions as was the case a century ago.However, there is one significant way in which the two pandemics are similar. History tends to refer to the earlier pandemic as the “1918 flu epidemic,” suggesting that a first, relatively mild strain broke out in the spring of that year, followed by a second, far more lethal strain in the fall. In fact, though, the second wave lasted until 1919—and there was a third wave in 1920. Medical researchers tell us that COVID-19 is almost certain to behave in a similar fashion. As I write, we are experiencing either the first or the second wave of the disease (the experts differ). Yet another outbreak seems certain, with or without the speedy development of a vaccine—polyannish predictions to the contrary notwithstanding."

Outside of these few very well-known accounts, there is almost nothing in literature about it afterwards. They write about horrors that people inflict on people. Apparently they forget the horrors that nature inflicts on people, the horrors that make humans least significant. And yet the pandemic resonated.” Times like these only help us get perspective, Human race suffers from Amnesia and keeps forgetting the one and biggest truth of all. As Nietzsche's said - ""In some remote corner of the universe, poured out and glittering in innumerable solar systems, there once was a star on which clever animals invented knowledge. That was the highest and most mendacious minute of ""world history""—yet only a minute. After nature had drawn a few breaths the star grew cold, and the clever animals had to die."" We are nothing but a speck of dust in the grand scheme of things and times like these keep reminding us that. But times likes also explain why we are most thriving species on the earth today. We have invented these abstract concepts of ""Love"" , ""Compassion"" and ""Hope"" and that's what defines us. At the end this will be over I hope we are able to learn something out of this. This is an amazing read in my mind. The book not just telling the story of the pandemic but the foundations of the medical science in America. The author has done an amazing job covering different aspect of those times and I can certainly draw similarities in the current ongoing situations. It has definitely given me perspective.

The early history of the practice medicine in this country and lack of training of the doctors was jaw dropping.

""In view of the comparatively short time during which most of the student-soldiers will remain in college and the exacting military duties awaiting them, academic instruction must necessarily be modified along the lines of direct military value.""I appreciated the great detail used in explaining the scientific rigor in trying to understand the disease that was plaguing the country and world. All the dead ends and false leads with persistent desperate scientists trying to find the answers in the midst of horror.""These things become easy to discern in hindsight.

I don't know if it's poorly-written or poorly-edited, but there were places were the same thing was said within pages of each other. And boring?!? Honestly, I was looking for a book about the flu to read during flu-season (especially in the year I decided NOT to get the flu shot), and all we get is lengthy biographies about the doctors and people who... well, I'm not even sure how most of them are important to the story. Really, when you pick up a book about a deadly disease you want to read about the deadly disease, and not wait for a couple hundred pages for it to appear or get good. The book is going back on the shelf but I guess I'll leave my bookmark where it is, just in case I get really bored."
210,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72479728-bryan-alkire,3,"Turned out to be ok, but given my high expectations for the book, ultimately disappointing. Before I get talk about the book itself, I’d like to say a few words about the peril of popular historical analogy. Really, this current Corona virus and the 1918 flu are not equivalent. Different diseases different times different responses. For starters, 1918 was a war economy. If people had chirped about lack of toilet paper or individual rights to be out and about, they would have been swiftly muzzled. Second, the government involvement at the federal level was vastly different. In 1918 the federal government did absolutely nothing, tot even brave words of comfort, for civilians suffers the flu. Today the government is throwing massive amounts of money at the problem even if it is at the behest of business special interests. At least the government is trying something. In fact, the only thing similar is that local governments are bearing the brunt of the response and that said response is a patchwork and that the media is following local government lead, in 1918 largely silent about the danger, in 2020 loudly proclaiming from the rooftops about the dangers. The last difference is the most important, different diseases. The 1918 flu struck quickly with a 48 to 72-hour incubation period and often killed suddenly as short as 12 hours after symptoms largely because the body’s immune system had to mount such a vigorous defense that if killed the body in the process. This corona virus is a two-week incubation period and seems to be more of a slow and more predictable killer.  Hopefully you’re still reading at this point as I will now discuss the book. I like books on pandemics when I can find them. They’re interesting and often draw lessons, usually for apocalypse writers, but unfortunately, real life currently. I chose this book because it’s the popular definitive work on the 1918 flu and that’s where the book falls short. The The organization of this book is just bad. It’s a confusing narrative structure with no real timeline and constant doubling back and forth interspersed with chapters on diseases and the like. It’s extremely repetitive. The writing is uneven. Sometimes it slows admirably and at other times gets bogged down in statistics and detail. The book also becomes awfully dry at times, particularly when discussing diseases themselves in quite detailed fashion. The content is also uneven. There’s lots here which isn’t truly relevant like medical school history and the life stories of doctors whose insolvent with the flu was more administrate than actual work. In short, this book was just a mess and clearly there was no good editing done on it. This book could have been a lot better than it was. So, I give this a 3. It’s interesting and at times, quite readable and even compelling. But, it’s dismally organized and edited. It could have been much better. "

Unlike most influenza, this one targeted young people in their 20s and 30s. Although it's called the Spanish flu because the Spanish press had extensive coverage of the disease, it's thought to have originated in Kansas. Soldiers carried the disease as they traveled between crowded military facilities, then crossed the Atlantic on crowded boats to fight in World War I.Author John M. Barry also writes about the advances in medical education and medical research in the United States which occurred just before the pandemic. The Johns Hopkins Medical School and the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research were highlighted. He goes into great detail describing the lives and work of the medical researchers. While the pandemic was raging, researchers were not able to identify the viral pathogen, and many thought that the bacteria causing secondary infections was responsible. The book contains excellent descriptions of how a virus attacks human cells and replicates in the body. The mutation of viruses and the development of vaccines are also discussed.Barry also writes about the way politics and misinformation from public officials exacerbated the pandemic of 1918. Although the book was written in 2004, it has warnings that are important today during the COVID crisis. This timely book is interesting and well researched, although some readers may find there is too much detail about the medical schools and researchers."
213,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2190636-joselito-honestly-and-brilliantly,5,"The 1918 Flu Pandemic coincided with the First World War and it killed more than both the military and civilian casualties of the conflict yet while the war generated an avalanche of literature (poems, songs, music, fiction, films, biographies and autobiographies) not much serious work had been done about this pandemic until this book published in 2004.I read this a few years back and I’ve disposed of my copy already but since it was a gripping, unforgettable read, I could still recall some tidbits of information about this 1918 pandemic in relation with what we are now experiencing during the present one.First of all, and this is what is often found to be the most surprising about whatever virus was it which caused the 1918 pandemic, the most vulnerable was those who were physically fit and at the prime of their lives (think those in their 20’s or 30’s who eat healthy and go to the gym). Contrast this with with most of the present Covid 19 fatalities who are old and who had pre-existing health issues. But why is that? For some reasons, the body’s immune system or antibodies react to the 1918 virus in a weird way. They overreact or overdo things. The analogy is that when a fly (the virus) enters a house (the human body) someone drops an atom bomb (the antibodies) on it to kill the fly and because of it even the house is completely destroyed. So that is why it was the healthy and the strong who mostly died: they were the ones with stronger antibodies.Secondly, the incubation period for the 1918 virus was apparently shorter. I think there was a story in the book about someone talking gaily on a street, apparently healthy, then in just an hour or so would die there in that same place. Or a bus of healthy-looking people stopping before it reaches its destination because its driver (with 6 of its passengers) dropping dead.The 1918 pandemic killed about 100 Million people worldwide. No one knew how it was stopped. Probably it just got tired of killing people."

The book is very dry to read. The writing is repetitive and it drags on and on. Part 1 is the development of American medical science (public health study, John Hopkins Medical School etc...).

There were three waves in the pandemic, the second wave the worst. In US, the condition in East Coast was worse than the west coast. San Francisco managed relatively well among big cities in US. Scientists did not find out the pathogen until many years later. The genome of the virus was sequenced in 2005.What strikes me most is that how the US politics today regarding Covid-19 has much in common with what happened in the 1918-1919 pandemic.

I thought this was going to read like a thriller by Michael Crichton or Dan Brown following a plucky single doctor who fights hard for his patients, makes a breakthrough, and saves the day. That's not this book because that's definitely not what happened. The book starts off with a history of medicine. I had a vague idea about this beginning with Hypocrites and then jumping to those bleeders in Period dramas that announce, ""He's not long for this world."" with much in between. But there wasn't much in between and that's the problem.    While the other sciences moved in leaps and bounds medicine did not. There were lightbulbs and trains and the doctor was still coming to bleed you. Barry gives two reasons for this stagnation. The first is the anathema of autopsy. For the longest time it was simply unthinkable to cut into and examine a human being, it was too close to butchers work. Then there was a religious stigma attached but even in the twentieth century the liberal gods spoke out against it. Hell, even today hardened cops don't like attending autopsies.The second reason is a little trickier to understand - medicine is not logical like the other sciences. Barry gives an excellent example. A doctor in the early 1900s noticed that the face flushed during fever so he reasoned that fever could be a capillary issue. To test his theory he bled his fever patients. They went pale, their temperature dropped, and they were ravenous for food and drink. A cure! He published his finding, which was easily replicated, and was much lauded by the medical community. It was perfectly logical. It was wrong. Due to this reputation for butchery, witchery, and general ineffectiveness, being a doctor was not a respected profession. Medical schools were shockingly bad pass/fail systems where teacher salaries were based on butts in seats. Things changed quickly when they changed and you'll have to read the book to find out. This was the first book I read in 2016 and here I sit on the last evening of the year trying to finish this review. It was not mere procrastination; I was daunted by how much I enjoyed, learned, and was affected by this book. I became a vegetarian for four months and switched out all my beauty products to the more expensive cruelty free lines. And that was not even the point of the book. This entire review and I haven't even mentioned the word flu. Sigh. Just read it. *special thanks to my 2015 Secret Santa Krystal!"
219,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1649751-florence,4,"This is a very frightening book. We usually consider the flu to be a non life threatening disease. Not true in 1918. The disease killed millions in a worldwide pandemic. The actual number of fatalities can never be known because medical systems were so overwhelmed that many people were dying at home without ever seeing a medical professional. The grisly details of how ordinary people suffered are in this comprehensive book. Also covered are scientific descriptions of bacteria and viruses that a reader without a scientific background can comprehend. The pandemic seemed to be a perfect storm. President Woodrow Wilson was myopically focused on victory overseas as the Great War raged on. He made a fateful decision to send ailing troops to Europe, disregarding the advice of military health experts, exponentially expanding the disease to Europe. It took over 20 years to identify the virus that causes influenza. Initially it is transferred from an animal and has the diabolic ability to rapidly mutate to a form that can be spread among humans. Can a pandemic of this scope occur again? Almost certainly."

ForsterIt took me the better part of the summer to listen to this audiobook in my car (I don't drive that much) -- and I confess that it soon became more of a chore than a pleasure. I do wish there had been a competently edited abridged version, for if ever a book cried out for editing, it was this one. Some of the book's strengths, however, include the exhaustive account of how the pandemic started and spread, not to mention the effect it had on society. There was a huge amount of material on how the authorities (mostly didn't) deal with the crisis, one of the key themes of the book being that in order to deal with such a threat that the civil authorities need to be completely honest about it. Point taken, but it was repeated over and over and over.... as were the somewhat melodramatic accounts of how the bodies stacked up, what having the disease was like, what the death toll was, and so on and so forth. Another strength was the intimate portraits of key researchers who rushed to find the cause of -- and a vaccine for -- the particularly virulent strain of influenza. There was a problem, though, in that the book's entire first section was a somewhat tedious historical account of the Johns Hopkins Institute. I'm still not sure why that was necessary (and suspect it wasn't). Granted, it was good to know what the state of medicine was at the turn of the century, but such an overview certainly could have been done more concisely. I also had real issues with the way several medical researchers, and in particular Paul Lewis, were cast into ""roles"" -- with Lewis the tragic figure that the author claimed was ""the last victim"" of the pandemic. Humph!However, I did find it fascinating to read about the details and design of medical research, and in particular how viruses mutated and became more or less deadly. In fact, I wished for a bit more of that information and less of the endless parade of statistics that Barry seemed so inordinately fond of. I came to believe that he had never met a statistic he didn't like (or subsequently use). Again, I was puzzled about why the editors hadn't intervened and winnowed out the repetitious material. Scott Brick, the reader for this book, was one of the biggest irritants, however, and no doubt significantly contributed to my feeling that the book was NEVER going to end. While his voice wasn't an unpleasant one, he seemed to have a very narrow ""range"" of intonation and emphasis. In fact, it sounded like he was overemphasizing just about everything, and he had a particular way of lingering over and stressing the word ""any"" that made me want to shriek after the first few hours. I had a hard time separating my irritation with his reading from my general impatience with the book, which is probably the reason I gave this three stars rather than two -- I'm not entirely sure whose fault it was that I didn't find this as interesting as I'd expected. (Plus, as Forster noted, one DOES tend to overpraise a long book that one finally manages to finish.) If I'd been reading this book rather than listening to it, undoubtedly I would have been able to skim pretty efficiently, slowing down for the parts that interested me the most and just skipping over the repetitive bits. But as a ""captive"" listener, it was pretty tough going. "
221,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/541670-caroline,2,"I had no less than four people come up to me while I was reading this book and tell me how great it was. Apparently it also made quite a splash at USAID when it was published. Maybe that's why three out of the four people who approached me were coworkers.It's possible these endorsements gave me unrealistic expectations, because by the time I finished it I was practically pulling my hair out. Which is a bummer because I was super excited to read The Great Influenza. I love books about medicine and medical history, so it wasn't the subject, it was what story author John Barry chose (tried?) to tell.An anecdote: Occasionally in high school, I would hit a particularly difficult calculus problem and seek out my mechanical engineer father for help. I'd show him the problem, perhaps a particularly pernicious related rate problem. Instead of starting from the problem itself, my dad always wanted to make sure I understood all of the individual concepts required to complete it. The running joke is that if I came to him with a calculus problem, he'd start no later in the material than the formal definition of a derivative and go from there. It would take several chapters worth of content before we arrived at the actual matter at hand. I still enjoy ribbing my dad about his approach to calculus assistance. He's sitting across the room from me right now and when I told him what I was writing he just grinned and declared ""First principles! You must build block by block on first principles!"" Hello, Dad who I've exaggerated for comedic effect, meet John M. Barry.John Barry started this book with Hippocrates and Galen. He then spent 166 pages getting from ancient Greece to the scientific revolution in American medicine that occurred in the early 20th century. He provides painstaking detail surrounding the creation of Johns Hopkins University (to be fair, this was pretty interesting, it's just... not the 1918 influenza pandemic). He introduces a small army of doctors, bacteriologists, and medical researchers, all of whom played a role in dragging medicine into the 20th century via the scientific method.Then, we have a mighty record scratch and Barry decides to spend about 200 pages on the 1918 epidemic itself. The majority of individuals introduced in the first section of the book take a backseat to an almost mind-numbing number of U.S. military cantonments, local and national politicians, and morbidity and mortality statistics. The level of detail is overwhelming and largely made my eyes glaze over. Frustratingly, this part of the book felt almost entirely disconnected from the medical history discussed earlier. Due to the severity of the pandemic, the carefully laboratory work according to the scientific method had to be discarded for shortcuts and best guesses. I figured Barry would highlight this irony and while he mentioned it a time or two, he for the most part just kept barreling forward through the history.Record scratch number two. With the end of the pandemic, we return to a smaller subset of the cast of characters discussed prior to its arrival and follow their lives and research down a number of paths that are only tangentially related (if at all) to influenza. Many of the most important individuals from the first part of the book are discarded without providing any sort of conclusion to their story.The whole thing was immensely aggravating. Whenever I look at a marble sculptures in art museums, I marvel at the fact that a sculptor was able to look at a block of stone, see the figure within, and get rid of the extra to reveal what was there all along. The Great Influenza felt like John M. Barry looking at a block of marble, seeing David, sculpting away, and instead revealing a figure with six arms, two heads, and feet erupting Alien-like from its chest. There are probably two and a half good books contained within, but Barry couldn't see what to get rid of and editor Wendy Wolf certainly didn't take a firm enough hand. I'm genuinely alarmed at the thought of what this book looked like pre-editor after reading the bloated and muddled final result. Here's the kicker: in the acknowledgements, John Barry pulls back the curtain on the process of writing the book and fully reveals his obliviousness. Get a load of this:""This book was initially supposed to be a straightforward story of the deadliest epidemic in human history, told from the perspectives of both scientists who tried to fight it and political leaders who tried to respond to it. I though it would take me two and a half years to write, three at the most. That plan didn't work. Instead this book took seven years to write. It has evolved (and, I hope, grown) into something rather different than originally conceived.""NO JOHN, THE NEW PLAN PLAN DIDN'T WORK. YOU SHOULD HAVE STUCK WITH THE ORIGINAL. Seven years. Holy crud.Other nits to pick: I often felt like Barry had an agenda to push. At various times in the book, he would stake out rather extreme positions and seemed to only approach the history from that angle, with Wilson's approach to World War I and the U.S. military's approach to the pandemic being two of the major examples. Were either perfect? Certainly not, but Barry seemed almost to cast them as the villains of the influenza pandemic, a practice I found unhelpful. I was also distinctly uncomfortable with an insinuation Barry made about the death of Paul A. Lewis. Implying suicide shouldn't be thrown around without evidence, and Barry provided nothing concrete. Not cool, dude.The writing is also nothing to write home about. Barry has an annoying habit of repeating anecdotes throughout the book and if I see the sentence ""It was influenza, only influenza"" one more time, I might scream.It's probably 1.5 stars but I'm rounding up. So why two instead of one? I did learn some things and a number of individual threads in the book were interesting. Highlights include a better understanding of why Johns Hopkins has the reputation it does, what the Hs and Ns are in influenza (ex: the H1N1 strain), and the word enzootic*.In all honesty, though, I'd probably pass on this one. You can learn the bulk of the 1918 influenza-specific stuff more quickly and enjoyably via Wikipedia. *It is to animals what the word ""epidemic"" is to humans, which makes sense given the roots. I'm distinctly less excited about it now, though, having just looked up the pronunciation and realized that it is pronounced en-zoh-AH-tic instead of en-ZOO-tic. I suppose you can't win them all."
222,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3244513-mike,4,"Overall this was a very good book. Expansive, thorough, and at times utterly fascinating. I'm sure people around me are completely sick of me talking about the flu at this point but this is that kind of book that will do that to you. It falls short of getting five stars for a couple of reasons, some of which are about the book but most of which are about me as a reader:1. It's almost too expansive: In Barry's quest to explore every possible nook and cranny of the 1918 Influenza pandemic he leaves no scientific idea or historical actor unearthed and thoroughly discussed. This lends to a skater shot feel to the book as you lurch from one person to another in chronological order with whole chapters about the science of viruses and bacteria popping up here and there to interrupt the forward momentum of the story. I feel like I got a about a dozen very short, somewhat shallow, biographies in this one book and a bit more science that I really wanted. 2. Lack of a supporting personal story or strong main character: When I contrast this book with Steven Johnson's ""Ghost Map"", which is all about John Snow and how he dealt with a cholera outbreak in London in the 19th Century, I find that it didn't hold my attention all the time because I didn't really connect with any of the people in the book or feel like there was a broad narrative that was pulling me along. Sure, he does a good job of showing how the pandemic began, how it peaks, and how it ebbs but the pandemic is far too amorphous for me to really relate to. And while he clearly shows how many of the people in the book react at these different phases I didn't really feel like I got to know any of them with the kind of detail that Johnson pulled out of John Snow.3. Hey, you got your science book in my history book! No, you got your history book in my science book! Wow, they're two great genres that kind of make for a confusing mess when you put them all together: Okay, this gripe is all about me as a reader. I'm WAY more interested in history and politics than science. Unless the science is about robots, zombies, or space ships at a certain point I kind of just zone out. Barry, at times, gets super deep on the science of influenza explaining in great detail how it infects the body and causes no end of problems. While it is a great feat of writing to talk about that sort of thing without losing the reader (to his credit it was never confusing) it doesn't make for a compelling read for me. When Barry talks about history in this book it's completely riveting, I literally couldn't put it down, but then there would be a speed bump science chapter and I'd have to slog through it to get back to the ideas that were the most interesting to me. It made for a frustrating read at times.Over all I would highly recommend this book. It really was quite good, my gripes aside. And, frankly, the historical implications of the book make it worth the read alone (namely that at a crucial junction in the negotiation of the Treaty of Versailles at the end of World War I Pres. Wilson came down with the flu and it, for a bunch of reasons, left him possibly permanently mentally impaired - he believed from that point on that French spies had infiltrated the White House for example - is shocking. Given that that treaty is often held directly responsible for the rise of Nazi Germany, and World War II, and that the principle features of that treaty may have caused the rise of the Nazi's were almost all pushed by the French and opposed by Pres. Wison, until his bought with the flu that is, one is left believing if not for the flu the world could have been very different). If you like science and enjoy history I think this would be a very satisfying reading experience.As an aside, I gave this book to my Grandmother for Christmas in 2009 when she was 91 years old. She and I developed a pattern late in her life of me giving her books that I'd read that I liked for birthdays and Christmas. She was an avid reader and game to read anything, although like me her preferences were more inclined to history, biography, and travel. This was one of the rare books I gave her without reading first. When I asked her, on Christmas 2011, to lend me one of her favorite books she gave me this one. She was born in April of 1918, near the beginning of this book, and I think for her the book explained a lot of things people would mention in her childhood that never made much sense (relatives who died during the flu, particular idioms people would use, or beliefs they had about sickness). She died in March of 2012 just a month shy of 94. In reading this book I am profoundly impressed by her intelligence. This book is not an easy read in spots (there were sections I read twice) and for someone who didn't even finish high school to read this book and not only understand it but enjoy it is a testament to the amazing person she was. This book still has the post-it note she always put on the inside front cover of books she got as gifts with the date, occasion, and person(s) who gave it to her. While she may be gone it makes me happy that she and I could at least share this one last experience together. "
223,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/82228946-nightlights,5,"Thought about giving this book four stars for minor repetition but last few chapters, and the afterword was so profound that it made everything even out.Early in the chapters, a mini-memoir of prominent scientists felt a bit excessive. But once you finish this book, a different perspective arises. The sacrifice Paul Lewis made just broke my heart. 🥺😞 (((Stay Safe Everyone)))"
224,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1923002-mara,3,"Read it for a biotech class in college and really enjoyed it- I mean, it shined pretty brightly compared to my biochem textbook"
225,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/611813-melinda,4,"Re-reading again in 2020 in the middle of the coronavirus outbreak.This is an excellent book. Reading it in the time of Coronavirus is eye-opening. I wish that the shrill shrieking gerbils of the media would provide comparisons ""per population"" for their numbers, and also comparisons with the traditional flu. The 2nd half of the book is especially worthwhile in this time of pandemic.********I highly recommend this book! It reads like a ""who-done-it"", except that you know who did it (the influenza virus) and you are watching the medical scientists struggle to find solutions while the wild-fire of the 1918 influenza pandemic raged all around them. Will they find a solution in time? (see the bottom paragraph for an answer to this question)Before documenting the path of the 1918 influenza, the author lays the groundwork for the transformed medical atmosphere from the late 1800's into the early 1900's in America. This path thus shows the beginnings of the the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research, the Phipps Institute, and Johns Hopkins University. Names of medical pioneers and influenza warriors such as Paul Lewis (who proved that polio was caused by a virus in 1907 and developed a vaccine that was 100% effective in protecting monkeys), William Henry Welch (the single most powerful individual in the history of American medicine, who directed the rise of Johns Hopkins University, and who with John D. Rockefeller Jr. created the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research, arguablly the best scientific research institute in the world), Simon Flexner (first head of the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research, the man who brought the mortality rate for common bacterial meningitis down to 18% in 1919 WITHOUT antibiotics!), Rufus Cole (who made the Rockefeller Institute Hospital a model for the way clinical research is conducted), Army Surgeon General William Gorgas (whose work in abating the transmission of yellow fever and malaria by controlling the mosquitos saved hundreds of thousands of lives, and allowed construction on the Panama Canal), Oswald Avery (whose work on influenza would lead him to one of the most important scientific discoveries in the 20th century, that DNA is the material of which genes and chromosomes are made), Anna Wessel Williams (the leading female bacteriologist in the world who worked hand in hand with William Park trying to develop a serum or vaccine for influenza),William Park (teamed with Anna Wessel Williams, developed the diptheria antitoxin still in use today), andRichard Shope (who as the first to prove that a virus caused influenza) fill the pages of this book. After setting the stage with its influenza warriors and medical laboratories, the author then begins the saga of the influenza virus itself. Influenza struck in the first wave in the winter and spring of 1918, a mild ""three day fever"" form that most recovered from. The second wave hit in the fall of 1918. This wave was the most virulent and deadly. The third wave hit somewhere in the winter / spring of 1919, and was once again a less virulent form. In just 2 years the virus mutated into a super killer, then back into a more mild disease. In raw numbers, the lowest estimate of the worldwide death toll at the time was 20 million. Knowing what we know now, epidemiologists today estimate that influenza caused at least 50 million and possibly 100 million deaths worldwide. All that in a time when the population of the world was 1/3rd of what it is today. The terrifying aspect of the super killer influenza was that it did not strike the traditional victims... the old and the very young, but instead hit hardest in the age group of 20's and 30's. If the upper estimate of 100 million deaths is accurate, then 8 to 10 percent of all young adults then living were killed by the virus.And these deaths happened with blinding speed. The influenza pandemic stretched out over 2 years. But 2/3rds of the deaths occurred in a period of 24 weeks. That is about 66 million deaths in 24 weeks. Averaged out that would be 2.5 million deaths per week. Yet more than half of those 66 million deaths happened from mid-September to early December of 1918. That is really 33 million deaths in 10 to 12 weeks! That's 3.3 MILLION deaths PER WEEK in the late fall and early winter of 1918! And remember that the world population at the time was less than 1/3rd of what it is today (which is 6.8 billion people). The numbers are just staggering, and I had to keep reading them and figuring out the numbers and it still is a staggering thought. So many died in so short a time! Epidemiological evidence from the work of Dr. Loring Miner seems to show that the new influenza virus originated in Haskell County, Kansas early in the winter of 1918. Dr. Miner documented early cases of the new influenza that showed disturbing mortality rates in a very short period of time. The virus then went to a huge army base in the eastern part of the state as troops were gathered in preparation for their deployment to Europe for WWI. From that army base, soliders were sent to France, soldiers were transferred to other bases in the United States....and the disease began sweeping through North America, Europe, South America, Asia, Africa, and the entire world. Some situations requiring fast decision making in chaotic circumstances were carried out well. Other situations were not handled as well. The ins and outs of these crossing paths of decisions, deaths mounting rapidly, politics, mililtary directives, and newly formed medical laboratories make up the rest of the book. The story is staggering, but gripping. In answer to the question at the beginning of this review, the answer is ""no, the medical scientists did not find a solution during the time of the 1918 thru 1920 influenza pandemic"". They learned alot, yes. They also learned that the only way to be protected from the disease was through isolation from it. Medical practices helping and treating the ill were improved, but a vaccine was never been found. The only reason the killing influenza stopped killing was because it mutated away from the more virulent form into a milder form. So the question immediately to ask is ""what happens if the virus mutates back to the virulent form?"". And that is the question we are left with at the end of the book. In the concluding chapter, the author raises these issues and concludes tentatively that in pandemic times, an authorized power (government, World Health Organization, army, someone) must have the authority to act and to act quickly, and their decisions must trump individual freedoms. Mandatory vaccinations, mandatory quaranatine, mandatory travel restrictions are the things that must be done to protect the larger population. The ""needs of the many outweigh the needs of the one"", if I may quote a Star Trek movie. In times of such overwhelming medical need, quick decisions must be made and sometimes they must be harsh."
226,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2201886-mike,4,"[Since that book deals with epidemic disease, also. In the present there is a virulent influenza outbreak and in the past there is the plague sweeping through England. This book deals with the deadliest outbreak of virulent influenza so far which, at the time, was often thought to be a form of plague (because of extreme cyanosis). Neat, tie-in huh? (hide spoiler)]"
227,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4118002-jeanne,4,"The Great Influenza is a sobering story, especially in today’s climate. This well-researched book gives a detailed account of why this deadly pandemic devastated the world. A well-written history."
228,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10978428-jim,4,"The bodies were piling up. The undertakers, themselves falling sick, were overwhelmed. There was no place to put the bodies. Gravediggers were either sick or refused to bury the influenza victims. Caskets were stacking up...then they ran short of caskets. The city morgue filled up. The stench was terrible...this was Philadelphia, October 1918, the time of the so-called ""Spanish flu."" Barry gives us a panoramic view of the most lethal influenza outbreak in history which occurred in 1918-1919. Today we believe that the death toll in the United States was 675,000 out of a population of 105 million. As many as 100 million died worldwide out of a global population of 1.8 billion, more than 5% of the world's population.  Barry follows the movement of the flu virus across the world, starting in rural Kansas, where somehow the virus crossed the animal-human barrier (from chickens?). It erupted in an Army camp in Kansas and moved east with the soldiers and then went on the troopships with them to Europe...It came in three waves, that first wave that hit the soldiers in the spring of 1918 was rather mild. But then in the fall, there was the second wave that was much more virulent--that's when most of the deaths occurred. Then the virus mutated again and there was a third wave which hit places like Australia--which had not been hit so hard by the second wave. Much of the book is involved with the story of the scientists battling the virus. Barry goes into some detail about this and focuses on some key figures. As he explains, a revolution had occurred in American medicine where labs had been organized and work was going on with the expectation that disease could be conquered by modern science. When it came to the great influenza, science failed. We are still living with the consequences of that.  The book was published in 2004 and, in it, Barry warns that we will face another pandemic. It's only a question of when. He states that we are NOT prepared for a pandemic. The events of this year of 2020 shows that he was right."
229,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6949571-thomas-paul,5,"It killed more people in 6 months than the Black Death killed in a century. People who were young and strong were the most likely to die. In the US, 650,000 people died. The average life expectancy in the US went down by 10 years. Worldwide, perhaps 100 million people died. And yet, it was only the flu. Even today, 90 years after the epidemic, it kills 36,000 Americans in a typical year and we are hardly more prepared to face another epidemic.John M. Barry has written a fascinating account of the influenza epidemic of 1918. But the book is a lot more than just a review of the flu. Barry starts out by examining the state of the American health system at the time of the epidemic and how it reached that state. He explores the revolutionary changes to medicine that occurred in the late 19th and early 20th century and the people who led those changes. He shows us why, even today, a cure for influenza is beyond our reach, explaining in layman’s terms how the influenza virus changes to become deadly and changes again to lose that deadliness. He explains how an endemic virus can lead to an epidemic of unimagined proportions.Barry also shows how the demands of World War I on troop movements, the propaganda campaigns to keep morale high, and the failure of leaders to listen to the doctors and researchers led to a killing field of historic size. His account tends to concentrate on Philadelphia because the city was hit extremely hard and much of the research going on was near that city but he does cover other areas around the world hit hard by the virus, although his coverage of the flu outside of the US is sketchy at best. He gives us writings from diaries and newspaper articles to show what was actually happening and how the media tried to downplay the epidemic. He gives us detailed accounts of the research (and the researchers) that was done to fight the epidemic, explains why this research was mostly unsuccessful, and does it all in a way that is easy to understand even if you don’t have a medical degree.Barry likes to use foreshadowing, hints of what is to come, to keep the reader’s interest and it does work, even if it is a bit melodramatic. Even the chapter titles, “The Tinderbox”, “It Begins”, The Race”, provide some melodrama to the story. The book mostly moves at a good pace and I found myself having trouble putting it down. Barry has written a book that everyone should read, whether you are familiar with the epidemic or not. It is a fascinating, terrifying, detailed, and extremely important book."
230,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8298053-colleen-browne,3,"This book starts out with a summary of medicine from Hippocrates to the First World War. That seems like it would be a long slog but because there was so little advancement during that time, it is done fairly quickly. As a reader with very limited knowledge of the history of medicine, I found this very interesting. What I didn't know at the beginning of the book was that the better part of the book was spent with the author going off on tangents only peripherally related to the pandemic. There is a great deal of information in this book, too much information. This book could have done with a good editor. The length of the book was about the same length as most of the books I read, and in many cases, much shorter but it didn't feel that way. It felt much longer. Barry's use of metaphor was helpful in explaining his subject and his style of writing wasn't awful as many reviewers have charged but he didn't seem to know when to stop on those threads that he followed out to what felt like oblivion at times. This is the first book I have read devoted to the subject (and may be the last). I could not recommend this book; at least not to anyone just interested in the pandemic. I can only suppose that there are better books on the topic."

233,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68316850-gavin,3,"Rousing history of one of the worst things that has ever happened: the 1918 outbreak of H1N1 flu. It focusses particularly on the great scientists who tried to fight it, none of whom I'd ever heard of. Also a meditation on epistemology, the modern mind, & the redemptive meaning of science for beasts like us.Barry senses that the headline result - one-third of the entire world infected, with 
25-100
 million dead - doesn't get enough of a rise from us. The numbers are numbing. So he couches it in modern shocking terms:
 It killed more people in twenty-four weeks than AIDS has killed in twenty-four years, more in a year than the Black Death killed in a century.
Or ten thousand 9/11s. It's worth belabouring this, because we have a weird habit of paying far more attention to human threats than natural ones, even when natural ones are far worse. (Witness our terrorism prevention budgets compared to our infectious disease control budgets, when the latter is a thousand times more lethal.)So: The 1918 flu was worse than the entire First World War: 40+ million died of flu compared with 17 million dead from war; 500 million lives damaged by flu vs 41 million lives by war. 3% of everyone alive died of flu, including about 8% of young adults(!).Except it's hard to separate the War and the pandemic. The virus was spread everywhere by unprecedented numbers of troops, and by the massive supply convoys it induced, and by the War's other human displacements. We don't know how many of the pneumonia deaths only occurred because of the logistical degradation, poverty and pestilence of wartime. There are terrible nonlinearities involved in overcrowding and global movement of troops. But add millions at least to the overall death toll caused by WWI.The book is in the epic mode, all the way through. (That's not a straightforward compliment.) I liked it, but I understand if it's a bit American for you:
Man might be defined as “modern” largely to the extent that he attempts to control nature. In this relationship with nature, modern humanity has generally been the aggressor, and a daring one at that, altering the flow of rivers, building upon geological faults, and, today, even engineering the genes of existing species. Nature has generally been languid in its response, although contentious once aroused and occasionally displaying a flair for violence.By 1918 humankind was fully modern, and fully scientific, but too busy fighting itself to aggress against nature. Nature, however, chooses its own moments. It chose this moment to aggress against man, and it did not do so prodding languidly. For the first time, modern humanity, a humanity practicing the modern scientific method, would confront nature in its fullest rage.
There's a long prelude describing how terrible medicine was up to the 20th Century. Medicine was ""the withered arm of science"". Therapeutic nihilism (that is, ""we can't really do anything"") was the only rational view, replacing millenia of Galenic woo.
Stengel reviewed dozens of ideas advanced in medical journals. Gargles of various disinfectants. Drugs. Immune sera. Typhoid vaccine. Diphtheria antitoxin. But Stengel’s message was simple: This doesn’t work. That doesn’t work. Nothing worked... Nothing they were doing worked.
Problem is, this rational scepticism created a powerful vacuum: humans need to believe something can heal, and the gap was filled with worse. Some confabulated gremlins from this time haunt us still: homeopathy, chiropractic, naturopathy, Christian Science, and (though Barry doesn't include them) the organic farming movement and psychoanalysis.Few people come off well. Even among the scientists, we get a horrible example of perverse priors and premature updating: an enormous proportion of all scientific resources were devoted to fighting the wrong pathogen, due to a bad guess by an extremely eminent researcher.Because so much of the state was occupied in war, in places there was wholesale social collapse:
In Philadelphia meanwhile fear came and stayed. Death could come from anyone, anytime. People moved away from others on the sidewalk, avoided conversation; if they did speak, they turned their faces away to avoid the other person’s breathing. The impossibility of getting help compounded the isolation. 850 Philadelphia doctors and more nurses were away in the military. More than that number were sick. Philadelphia General Hospital had 126 nurses. Despite all precautions, despite wearing surgical masks and gowns, eight doctors and fifty-four nurses—43 percent of the staff—themselves required hospitalization. Ten nurses at this single hospital died. The Board of Health pleaded for help from retired nurses and doctors if they remembered “even a little” of their profession.When a nurse or doctor or policeman did actually come, they wore their ghostly surgical masks, and people fled them. In every home where someone was ill, people wondered if the person would die. And someone was ill in every home...Starr went to Emergency Hospital #2 at Eighteenth and Cherry Streets. He did have help, if it could be called that, from an elderly physician who had not practiced in years and who brought Starr into touch with the worst of heroic medicine. Starr wouldn’t forget that, the ancient arts of purging, of venesection, the ancient art of opening a patient’s vein. But for the most part he and the other students elsewhere were on their own, with little help even from nurses, who were so desperately needed that in each of ten emergency hospitals supplied by the Red Cross only a single qualified nurse was available to oversee whatever women came as volunteers. And often the volunteers reported for their duty once and, from either fear or exhaustion, did not come again.Nearly 1/4 of all the patients in his hospital died each day. Starr would go home, and when he returned the next day, he would find that between one-quarter and one-fifth of the patients in the hospital had died, replaced by new ones... Virtually all of them, along with their friends and relatives, were terrified that, no matter how mild the symptoms seemed at first, within them moved an alien force, a seething, spreading infection, a live thing with a will that was taking over their bodies — and could be killing them...The city was frozen with fear, frozen into stillness. Starr lived 12 miles from the hospital. The streets were silent on his drive home, silent. They were so silent he took to counting the cars he saw. One night he saw no cars at all. He thought, “The life of the city had almost stopped.”
Everyone can read the collapse of official power in Philadelphia as supporting their politics. Anarchists can point to the benevolent spontaneous order that arose after the corrupt local government failed to act; libertarians can point out that this spontaneous order was all funded by the richest Philadelphians; statists can point out that, without actually-authoritative co-ordination, the effort eventually failed, because people defected against each other, in fear.
The corpses had backed up at undertakers’, filling every area of these establishments and pressing up into living quarters; in hospital morgues overflowing into corridors; in the city morgue overflowing into the street. And they had backed up in homes. They lay on porches, in closets, in corners of the floor, on beds. Children would sneak away from adults to stare at them, to touch them; a wife would lie next to a dead husband, unwilling to move him or leave him. The corpses, reminders of death and bringers of terror or grief, lay under ice at Indian-summer temperatures. Their presence was constant, a horror demoralizing the city; a horror that could not be escaped. Finally the city tried to catch up to them.The police wore their ghostly surgical masks, and people fled them, but the masks had no effect on the viruses and by mid-October thirty-three policemen had died, with many more to follow... More coffins came by rail, guarded by men with guns.
""There is, therefore, but one response possible from us: Force! force to the utmost, force without stint or limit, the righteous and triumphant force which shall make right the law of the world and cast every selfish dominion down in the dust. ""- Woodrow Wilson addressing one of his money-lending mobs.Wilson tends to be viewed pretty positively, just because he won. (""at last the world knows America as the savior of the world!"") But he perverted an entire state and nation to do so, ignored the terrible suffering of his own damn population for years, and refused a conditional peace with Austria in August and with the Kaiser's new parliament in September. (This meant 30-70 extra days of war, which, if this period was as lethal as the rest of the war, means up to 800,000 completely unnecessary deaths, not to mention the continuing waste of resources during the worst epidemic ever). Wilson did great evil, was not much different from the Kaiser, the election aside.
 the military suctioned more and more nurses and physicians into cantonments, aboard ships, into France, until it had extracted nearly all the best young physicians. Medical care for civilians deteriorated rapidly. The doctors who remained in civilian life were largely either incompetent young ones or those over forty-five years of age, the vast majority of whom had been trained in the old ways of medicine. 
Barry's middle chapters are a frightening portrait of how rabidly un-American the US was in 1918. The laws were bad enough - for instance the ban on criticising the government. But then there's the unofficial ""patriotic duties"", punishable by beatings. State-sponsored atavism.
By the summer of 1918, however, Wilson had injected the government into every facet of national life and had created great bureaucratic engines to focus all the nation’s attention and intent on the war.He had created a Food Administration to control and distribute food, a Fuel Administration to ration coal and gasoline, a War Industries Board to oversee the entire economy. He had taken all but physical control over the railroads and had created a federally sponsored river barge line that brought commerce back to life on the Mississippi River, a commerce that had been killed by competition from those railroads. He had built many dozens of military installations, each of which held at least tens of thousands of soldiers or sailors. He had created industries that made America’s shipyards teem with hundreds of thousands of laborers launching hundreds of ships, dug new coal mines to produce coal for the factories that weaned America’s military from British and French weapons and munitions—for, unlike in World War II, America was no arsenal of democracy.He had created a vast propaganda machine, an internal spy network, a bond-selling apparatus... He had even succeeded in stifling speech, in the summer of 1918 arresting and imprisoning — some for prison terms longer than ten years —not just radical labor leaders and editors of German-language newspapers but powerful men, even a congressman.He had injected the government into American life in ways unlike any other in the nation’s history. And the final extension of federal power had come only in the spring of 1918, after the first wave of influenza had begun jumping from camp to camp, when the government expanded the draft from males between the ages of twenty-one and thirty to those between the ages of eighteen and forty-five. Only on May 23, 1918, had Provost Marshal Enoch Crowder, who oversaw the draft, issued his “work or fight” order, stating that anyone not employed in an essential industry would be drafted...Crowder bragged about doing “in a day what the Prussian autocracy had been spending nearly fifty years to perfect...""In mid-August, as the lethal wave of the epidemic was gathering itself, Austria had already inquired about peace terms, an inquiry that Wilson rebuffed utterly. And as the epidemic was gathering full momentum, peace was only weeks away. Bulgaria had signed an armistice on September 29. On September 30, Kaiser Wilhelm had granted parliamentary government to the German nation; that same day Ludendorff had warned his government that Germany must extend peace feelers or disaster—immediate disaster—would follow. German diplomats sent out those feelers. Wilson ignored them. The Central Powers, Germany and her allies, were simultaneously breaking off one from one another and disintegrating internally as well. In the first week of October, Austria and Germany separately sent peace feelers to the Allies, and on October 7, Austria delivered a diplomatic note to Wilson formally seeking peace on any terms Wilson chose. Ten days later — days of battle and deaths — the Austrian note remained unanswered.Earlier Wilson had spoken of a “peace without victory,” believing only such a peace could last. But now he gave no indication that the war would soon be over. Although a rumor that the war had ended sent thrills through the nation, Wilson quickly renounced it. Nor would he relent. He was not now fighting to the death; he was fighting only to kill...If Wilson and his government would not be turned from his end even by the prospect of peace, they would hardly be turned by a virus. And the reluctance, inability, or outright refusal of the American government to shift targets would contribute to the killing. Wilson took no public note of the disease, and the thrust of the government was not diverted. The relief effort for influenza victims would find no assistance in the Food Administration or the Fuel Administration or the Railroad Administration. From neither the White House nor any other senior administration post would there come any leadership, any attempt to set priorities, any attempt to coordinate activities, any attempt to deliver resources....the military would give no help to civilians. Instead it would draw further upon civilian resources. The same day that Welch had stepped out of the autopsy room at Devens and called Gorgas’s office, his warning had been relayed to the army chief of staff, urging that all transfers be frozen unless absolutely necessary and that under no circumstances transfers from infected camps be made... Gorgas’s superiors ignored the warning. There was no interruption of movement between camps whatsoever; not until weeks later, with the camps paralyzed and, literally, tens of thousands of soldiers dead or dying, did the army make any adjustments.
Because the disease was everywhere, ravaging the entire species (and beyond), the book can't cover everything. Very little is said about non-Americans, i.e about 98% of the death and chaos. This is partly because there just isn't a lot of evidence about them, despite their influenza immunity and medical care being even worse. (This is why the top estimates reach 100m deaths, three times the median estimate.) Here is a passage about just a tiny number of them, in the north:
In Alaska, whites protected themselves. Sentries guarded all trails, and every person entering the city was quarantined for five days. Eskimos had no such luck. A senior Red Cross official warned that without “immediate medical assistance the race” could become “extinct.”...The navy provided the collier USS Brutus to carry a relief expedition... They found terrible things. One doctor visited ten tiny villages and found “three wiped out entirely; others average 85% deaths… Survivors generally children… probably 25% frozen to death before help arrived.”The virus probably did not kill all of them directly. But it struck so suddenly it left no one well enough to care for any others, no one to get food, no one to get water. And those who could have survived, surrounded by bodies, bodies of people they loved, might well have preferred to go where their family had gone, might well have wanted to no longer be alone... Two hundred sixty-six people had lived in Okak, and many dogs, dogs nearly wild. When the virus came, it struck so hard so fast people could not care for themselves or feed the dogs. The dogs grew hungry, crazed with hunger, devoured each other, then wildly smashed through windows and doors, and fed... In all of Labrador, at least one-third the total population died. 
---Barry commits at least one big error: he's horrified by the medical schools of the time having ""no standards for admission"":
 In research and education especially, American medicine lagged far behind [European medicine]... At least one hundred US medical schools would accept any man willing to pay tuition... and only a single medical school required its student to have a college degree... the Johns Hopkins itself, not student fees, paid [its] faculty salaries, and it required medical students to have not only a college degree but fluency in French and German and a background of science courses. 
But his enthusiasm for Johns Hopkins introducing the college degree requirement is misplaced. Contemporary US doctors (who all have 3 years of pre-med, or even more college, before they start medical training) are probably no better clinicians than undergraduate doctors in other countries, and are far further in debt. This requirement is probably one reason the American system is so fucked.I suppose Barry is just confusing the open admissions situation with the schools' appallingly low graduation standards, which is certainly one reason eC20th medicine sucked. (Many doctors had never looked down a microscope, never used a stethoscope on a patient, never seen a dissection.)---PS: Mostly unimportant corrections by a virologist here.

234,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22063432-tom-mathews,5,"The old adage that 'those who fail to learn from the past are condemned to repeat it' has never been so true. President George W. Bush read this book shortly after it was published and was so impressed by the threat of future pandemics that he commissioned a department whose sole function was to prepare for future pandemics. This involved cooperation by federal, state and international entities (such as the WHO) to set up surveillance networks for potentially deadly diseases and to stockpile drugs and equipment such as mechanical ventilators that could be used in the event of a sharp spike in the number of inpatient hospitalizations. Unfortunately, the current president quickly defunded and essentially disbanded all of President Bush's efforts to prepare for what scientists and even foresighted politicians knew was inevitable. In his book, Barry wrote of the things that people did to protect themselves in 1918-19 and recommendations for what we could do when the next pandemic occurred. There was actually very few differences between the two lists: masks, hand-washing, social distancing and the cancelling of large gatherings being prominent on both lists. Barry asserted that our greatest chance of preventing a full-scale calamity lay in forethought and preparation. We will never know if that would have had much of an impact. When Barry wrote this book he likely couldn't have foreseen the political situation the U.S. finds itself in today but he knew politicians. He knew that in order to avoid boosting the enemy's morale in wartime, our leaders refused to speak honestly about the seriousness of the influenza pandemic and, as a result, millions died. But if he thought that politicians today were any better, he likely wouldn't have written in the afterward of one edition ""On a larger scale, and far more difficult, will be getting governments to tell the truth about the disease. This is perhaps the biggest lesson about 1918 and it is a lesson not yet learned.""I try to avoid revealing spoilers in my reviews but these are unusual times and I think that the best way to close this review is to let Barry do it for me. Here are the closing paragraphs in this magnificent work:
So the final lesson of 1918, a simple one yet one most difficult to execute, is that those who occupy positions of authority must lessen the panic that can alienate all within a society. Society cannot function if it is every man for himself. By definition, civilization cannot survive that. Those in authority must retain the public’s trust. The way to do that is to distort nothing, to put the best face on nothing, to try to manipulate no one. Lincoln said that first, and best. A leader must make whatever horror exists concrete. Only then will people be able to break it apart.

236,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4739424-mal-warwick,5,"A century ago a pandemic disease far more lethal than COVID-19 killed an estimated fifty to one hundred million people around the world—as many as one out of every twenty people then alive. The 1918 flu epidemic erupted during a war that had already killed tens of millions and at a time when medical science was far less accomplished than it is today. Although there are lessons to learn for our response to COVID-19, it’s important to view what happened then in its historical context. And that’s the approach John M. Barry so brilliantly takes in The Great Influenza. This engrossing book may well be one of the very best ever written on medical history.The historical context of the 1918 flu epidemicAs Barry makes clear, medical science had taken big steps forward in the decades before the pandemic erupted, especially in the United States. Half a century earlier, German researchers, and French to a lesser extent, led the world in medical research. However, by the outbreak of World War I, two institutions had spearheaded immense advances in American medicine: Johns Hopkins Hospital and the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research (later Rockefeller University).Johns Hopkins Hospital, founded in 1889, had been established expressly to bring the scientific method into the teaching and practice of medicine in the United States. The Rockefeller Institute set out from day one to become the world’s most important medical research institution, and many observers have expressed the opinion that it succeeded very shortly after its establishment in 1901. Barry traces the evolution of both Johns Hopkins and the Rockefeller (as they were then known) through in-depth sketches of the prominent physicians who led them. Those doctors, the heroes of the tale, played leadership roles in combating the 1918 flu epidemic, advising the military and government at all levels on precautionary measures and researching the origins of the disease and possible treatment. Unfortunately, they made little headway in either respect.Why the disease spread so widely and so quicklyThe doctors’ increasingly strident insistence on warning the public about the epidemic were met with rigid resistance until hundreds of thousands of Americans had already died. The Wilson administration had instituted draconian measures to prevent any news from reaching the public that would turn its attention from the need to support the war effort. Although press censorship was not in force, the nation’s press almost uniformly self-censored, parroting the official line that the disease was not serious while bodies piled up in the morgues. The result then, as it is today in the COVID-19 pandemic, was that those who denied the problem lost the public’s trust. But the biggest reason the influenza spread so widely and so quickly was the insistence of the US Army on transferring troops in large numbers from one base to another in crowded trains and then overseas in crowded ships.The 1918 flu epidemic was “the deadliest pandemic in history”Although up to five percent of the world’s population—and “as many as 8 to 10 percent of all young adults then living—died from the so-called “Spanish influenza,” its impact was not limited to the appalling death toll. Naturally, the pandemic greatly influenced the course of medical research and the adoption of public health measures far more widely than had been the case. But its consequences were far-reaching both in the conduct of World War I and in the shape of the peace that emerged from the conflict. Barry skillfully explores both themes in The Great Influenza.How the epidemic helped defeat GermanyIn April 1918, German commander Erich Ludendorff began “his last great offensive—Germany’s last real chance to win the war. The . . . offensive made great initial gains.” But then it stalled. Barry quotes the diary of a US Army surgeon stationed near the front: “‘The expected third phase of the great German offensive gets put off from day to day . . . I gather that the epidemic of grippe which hit us rather hard in Flanders also hit the Boche worse, and this may have caused the delay.'” In fact, Ludendorff himself “blamed influenza for the loss of initiative and the ultimate failure of the offensive.” No single battle necessarily changes the course of any war (although Midway, Stalingrad, and the Normandy Invasion are all claimed to have done just that in the next war.) But contemporary observers in 1918, and military analysts now, seem to agree that however slim the likelihood that Germany might end up victorious was certainly then lost.How the 1918 flu epidemic helped cause World War IIHistorians agree that the Treaty of Versailles that brought World War I to a close was a disaster. The excessive pain it imposed on Germany is almost universally acknowledged to have led in virtually a straight line to the Second World War. Yet that treaty took the form it did only because, midway through the peace conference, the world’s most popular statesman, Woodrow Wilson, suddenly and unaccountably “abandoned principles he had previously insisted upon. He yielded to [French Prime Minister Georges] Clemenceau everything of significance Clemenceau wanted, virtually all of which Wilson had earlier opposed.” Clemenceau was the primary architect of the harsh provisions incorporated into the treaty.Most accounts of Wilson’s strange turnabout at Versailles ascribe it to a minor stroke he suffered. The President was, in fact, in his sickbed when he made the fateful decision. However, Barry cites powerful evidence that Wilson had not in fact suffered a stroke. He had the flu. “Wilson’s actual symptoms—including high fever, severe coughing, and total prostration, [were] all symptoms that perfectly fit influenza and have no association whatsoever with stroke . . . Indeed, the virus may have contributed to the [severe] stroke” Wilson suffered much later that incapacitated him and led to his death.Where the “Spanish flu” really originatedWithin months of its appearance in the United States, the 1918 flu epidemic quickly went pandemic throughout Western Europe. The “Great War” was in its final months at the time, and rigid press censorship was in force on both sides of the trenches. Thus, even though thousands of American, French, British, and German troops were falling ill throughout the war zone, no news about their plight reached the home front in any one of the combatant countries. Neutral Spain, however, was different. There, alarmist reports about the virulence of the fast-spreading disease were splashed all over front pages. And that was how the epidemic came to be dubbed the “Spanish flu.”In fact, as Barry reports in detail, the deadly strain of H1N1 influenza at the heart of the 1918 flu epidemic almost certainly originated in Haskell County, Kansas, early that year. From there, the disease made its way eastward to a huge army “cantonment” where tens of thousands of troops were preparing to be shipped to France as cannon fodder for “Black Jack” Pershing‘s push against the German lines. Tens of thousands never made it there, falling victim instead to the flu. And, in carrying the disease to Europe, they triggered its spread to both Allied and enemy troops as well as civilian populations throughout Western Europe and ultimately to the rest of the world.How the 1918 flu epidemic was different from COVID-19In two major respects, the pandemic of a century ago differed significantly from what we are experiencing as I write:** Influenza is a respiratory disease that primarily attacks the lungs, nose, and throat. When it kills, it does so primarily through pneumonia. Although COVID-19 was initially feared to be similar in its effects, it is in truth a vascular disease that manifests through the circulatory system. ** It’s difficult for scientists to calculate the mortality (death) rate of a disease. But it is clear that the H1N1 influenza virus that emerged in 1918 was far more lethal than the COVID-19 strains that have been seen to date. Hundreds of thousands are dying today. Eventually, it seems likely that globally millions will do so. But it seems highly unlikely that the death toll will rise into the tens of millions as was the case a century ago.However, there is one significant way in which the two pandemics are similar. History tends to refer to the earlier pandemic as the “1918 flu epidemic,” suggesting that a first, relatively mild strain broke out in the spring of that year, followed by a second, far more lethal strain in the fall. In fact, though, the second wave lasted until 1919—and there was a third wave in 1920. Medical researchers tell us that COVID-19 is almost certain to behave in a similar fashion. As I write, we are experiencing either the first or the second wave of the disease (the experts differ). Yet another outbreak seems certain, with or without the speedy development of a vaccine—polyannish predictions to the contrary notwithstanding."

Outside of these few very well-known accounts, there is almost nothing in literature about it afterwards. They write about horrors that people inflict on people. Apparently they forget the horrors that nature inflicts on people, the horrors that make humans least significant. And yet the pandemic resonated.” Times like these only help us get perspective, Human race suffers from Amnesia and keeps forgetting the one and biggest truth of all. As Nietzsche's said - ""In some remote corner of the universe, poured out and glittering in innumerable solar systems, there once was a star on which clever animals invented knowledge. That was the highest and most mendacious minute of ""world history""—yet only a minute. After nature had drawn a few breaths the star grew cold, and the clever animals had to die."" We are nothing but a speck of dust in the grand scheme of things and times like these keep reminding us that. But times likes also explain why we are most thriving species on the earth today. We have invented these abstract concepts of ""Love"" , ""Compassion"" and ""Hope"" and that's what defines us. At the end this will be over I hope we are able to learn something out of this. This is an amazing read in my mind. The book not just telling the story of the pandemic but the foundations of the medical science in America. The author has done an amazing job covering different aspect of those times and I can certainly draw similarities in the current ongoing situations. It has definitely given me perspective.

The early history of the practice medicine in this country and lack of training of the doctors was jaw dropping.

""In view of the comparatively short time during which most of the student-soldiers will remain in college and the exacting military duties awaiting them, academic instruction must necessarily be modified along the lines of direct military value.""I appreciated the great detail used in explaining the scientific rigor in trying to understand the disease that was plaguing the country and world.

We'll see...2/28/18 REVIEW: Sigh, giving up on this book and marking it DNF. It's bloated and repetitive and verbose and wordy and ... umm, did I mention it's repetitive? I don't know if it's poorly-written or poorly-edited, but there were places were the same thing was said within pages of each other. And boring?!? Honestly, I was looking for a book about the flu to read during flu-season (especially in the year I decided NOT to get the flu shot), and all we get is lengthy biographies about the doctors and people who... well, I'm not even sure how most of them are important to the story. Really, when you pick up a book about a deadly disease you want to read about the deadly disease, and not wait for a couple hundred pages for it to appear or get good. The book is going back on the shelf but I guess I'll leave my bookmark where it is, just in case I get really bored."
240,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72479728-bryan-alkire,3,"Turned out to be ok, but given my high expectations for the book, ultimately disappointing. Before I get talk about the book itself, I’d like to say a few words about the peril of popular historical analogy. Really, this current Corona virus and the 1918 flu are not equivalent. Different diseases different times different responses. For starters, 1918 was a war economy. If people had chirped about lack of toilet paper or individual rights to be out and about, they would have been swiftly muzzled. Second, the government involvement at the federal level was vastly different. In 1918 the federal government did absolutely nothing, tot even brave words of comfort, for civilians suffers the flu. Today the government is throwing massive amounts of money at the problem even if it is at the behest of business special interests. At least the government is trying something. In fact, the only thing similar is that local governments are bearing the brunt of the response and that said response is a patchwork and that the media is following local government lead, in 1918 largely silent about the danger, in 2020 loudly proclaiming from the rooftops about the dangers. The last difference is the most important, different diseases. The 1918 flu struck quickly with a 48 to 72-hour incubation period and often killed suddenly as short as 12 hours after symptoms largely because the body’s immune system had to mount such a vigorous defense that if killed the body in the process. This corona virus is a two-week incubation period and seems to be more of a slow and more predictable killer.  Hopefully you’re still reading at this point as I will now discuss the book. I like books on pandemics when I can find them. They’re interesting and often draw lessons, usually for apocalypse writers, but unfortunately, real life currently. I chose this book because it’s the popular definitive work on the 1918 flu and that’s where the book falls short. The The organization of this book is just bad. It’s a confusing narrative structure with no real timeline and constant doubling back and forth interspersed with chapters on diseases and the like. It’s extremely repetitive. The writing is uneven. Sometimes it slows admirably and at other times gets bogged down in statistics and detail. The book also becomes awfully dry at times, particularly when discussing diseases themselves in quite detailed fashion. The content is also uneven. There’s lots here which isn’t truly relevant like medical school history and the life stories of doctors whose insolvent with the flu was more administrate than actual work. In short, this book was just a mess and clearly there was no good editing done on it. This book could have been a lot better than it was. So, I give this a 3. It’s interesting and at times, quite readable and even compelling. But, it’s dismally organized and edited. It could have been much better. "
241,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12087691-wendyb,5," A must-read book for the times we live in.Starts out with maybe just a little too much background on some of the doctors involved in the 1918 flu research but still interesting info on the state of medicine at that time.Got really interesting with the info on the start of the flu and the effect on the population.In researching my family background, I discovered my grandparents' first child died in Oct 1918 of the Spanish Flu at just 12 days old. So in some small ways, this history still touches us today."
242,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5364077-connie-g,4,"The great influenza pandemic of 1918-1920 killed between 20 to 100 million people worldwide, more fatalities than any other pandemic in history. Unlike most influenza, this one targeted young people in their 20s and 30s. Although it's called the Spanish flu because the Spanish press had extensive coverage of the disease, it's thought to have originated in Kansas. Soldiers carried the disease as they traveled between crowded military facilities, then crossed the Atlantic on crowded boats to fight in World War I.Author John M. Barry also writes about the advances in medical education and medical research in the United States which occurred just before the pandemic. The Johns Hopkins Medical School and the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research were highlighted. He goes into great detail describing the lives and work of the medical researchers. While the pandemic was raging, researchers were not able to identify the viral pathogen, and many thought that the bacteria causing secondary infections was responsible. The book contains excellent descriptions of how a virus attacks human cells and replicates in the body. The mutation of viruses and the development of vaccines are also discussed.Barry also writes about the way politics and misinformation from public officials exacerbated the pandemic of 1918. Although the book was written in 2004, it has warnings that are important today during the COVID crisis. This timely book is interesting and well researched, although some readers may find there is too much detail about the medical schools and researchers."
243,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2190636-joselito-honestly-and-brilliantly,5,"The 1918 Flu Pandemic coincided with the First World War and it killed more than both the military and civilian casualties of the conflict yet while the war generated an avalanche of literature (poems, songs, music, fiction, films, biographies and autobiographies) not much serious work had been done about this pandemic until this book published in 2004.I read this a few years back and I’ve disposed of my copy already but since it was a gripping, unforgettable read, I could still recall some tidbits of information about this 1918 pandemic in relation with what we are now experiencing during the present one.First of all, and this is what is often found to be the most surprising about whatever virus was it which caused the 1918 pandemic, the most vulnerable was those who were physically fit and at the prime of their lives (think those in their 20’s or 30’s who eat healthy and go to the gym). Contrast this with with most of the present Covid 19 fatalities who are old and who had pre-existing health issues. But why is that? For some reasons, the body’s immune system or antibodies react to the 1918 virus in a weird way. They overreact or overdo things. The analogy is that when a fly (the virus) enters a house (the human body) someone drops an atom bomb (the antibodies) on it to kill the fly and because of it even the house is completely destroyed. So that is why it was the healthy and the strong who mostly died: they were the ones with stronger antibodies.Secondly, the incubation period for the 1918 virus was apparently shorter. I think there was a story in the book about someone talking gaily on a street, apparently healthy, then in just an hour or so would die there in that same place. Or a bus of healthy-looking people stopping before it reaches its destination because its driver (with 6 of its passengers) dropping dead.The 1918 pandemic killed about 100 Million people worldwide. No one knew how it was stopped. Probably it just got tired of killing people."

The book is very dry to read. The writing is repetitive and it drags on and on. Part 1 is the development of American medical science (public health study, John Hopkins Medical School etc...). Part 2 is mostly US politics (Woodrow Wilson, WWI and how wartime censorship was implemented). The rest is about the pandemic. The book should be better titled as ""The Great Influenza and How the US Dealt With It"", because it covers only a little outside the United States.At least 50m people (5% world population) had been wiped out by the pandemic, which is equivalent to 390m people today. There were three waves in the pandemic, the second wave the worst. In US, the condition in East Coast was worse than the west coast. San Francisco managed relatively well among big cities in US. Scientists did not find out the pathogen until many years later. The genome of the virus was sequenced in 2005.What strikes me most is that how the US politics today regarding Covid-19 has much in common with what happened in the 1918-1919 pandemic.

248,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35645863-lena,5,"Beyond five stars. How many books are entertaining, important, engaging and edifying? I can only think of one, this one.  I thought this was going to read like a thriller by Michael Crichton or Dan Brown following a plucky single doctor who fights hard for his patients, makes a breakthrough, and saves the day. That's not this book because that's definitely not what happened. The book starts off with a history of medicine. I had a vague idea about this beginning with Hypocrites and then jumping to those bleeders in Period dramas that announce, ""He's not long for this world."" with much in between. But there wasn't much in between and that's the problem.    While the other sciences moved in leaps and bounds medicine did not. There were lightbulbs and trains and the doctor was still coming to bleed you. Barry gives two reasons for this stagnation. The first is the anathema of autopsy. For the longest time it was simply unthinkable to cut into and examine a human being, it was too close to butchers work. Then there was a religious stigma attached but even in the twentieth century the liberal gods spoke out against it. Hell, even today hardened cops don't like attending autopsies.The second reason is a little trickier to understand - medicine is not logical like the other sciences. Barry gives an excellent example. A doctor in the early 1900s noticed that the face flushed during fever so he reasoned that fever could be a capillary issue. To test his theory he bled his fever patients. They went pale, their temperature dropped, and they were ravenous for food and drink. A cure! He published his finding, which was easily replicated, and was much lauded by the medical community. It was perfectly logical. It was wrong. Due to this reputation for butchery, witchery, and general ineffectiveness, being a doctor was not a respected profession. Medical schools were shockingly bad pass/fail systems where teacher salaries were based on butts in seats. Things changed quickly when they changed and you'll have to read the book to find out. This was the first book I read in 2016 and here I sit on the last evening of the year trying to finish this review. It was not mere procrastination; I was daunted by how much I enjoyed, learned, and was affected by this book. I became a vegetarian for four months and switched out all my beauty products to the more expensive cruelty free lines. And that was not even the point of the book. This entire review and I haven't even mentioned the word flu. Sigh. Just read it. *special thanks to my 2015 Secret Santa Krystal!"
249,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1649751-florence,4,"This is a very frightening book. We usually consider the flu to be a non life threatening disease. Not true in 1918. The disease killed millions in a worldwide pandemic. The actual number of fatalities can never be known because medical systems were so overwhelmed that many people were dying at home without ever seeing a medical professional. The grisly details of how ordinary people suffered are in this comprehensive book. Also covered are scientific descriptions of bacteria and viruses that a reader without a scientific background can comprehend. The pandemic seemed to be a perfect storm. President Woodrow Wilson was myopically focused on victory overseas as the Great War raged on. He made a fateful decision to send ailing troops to Europe, disregarding the advice of military health experts, exponentially expanding the disease to Europe. It took over 20 years to identify the virus that causes influenza. Initially it is transferred from an animal and has the diabolic ability to rapidly mutate to a form that can be spread among humans. Can a pandemic of this scope occur again? Almost certainly."
250,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/241691-kay,3,"""One always tends to overpraise a long book because one has got through it."" – E.M. ForsterIt took me the better part of the summer to listen to this audiobook in my car (I don't drive that much) -- and I confess that it soon became more of a chore than a pleasure. I do wish there had been a competently edited abridged version, for if ever a book cried out for editing, it was this one. Some of the book's strengths, however, include the exhaustive account of how the pandemic started and spread, not to mention the effect it had on society. There was a huge amount of material on how the authorities (mostly didn't) deal with the crisis, one of the key themes of the book being that in order to deal with such a threat that the civil authorities need to be completely honest about it. Point taken, but it was repeated over and over and over.... as were the somewhat melodramatic accounts of how the bodies stacked up, what having the disease was like, what the death toll was, and so on and so forth. Another strength was the intimate portraits of key researchers who rushed to find the cause of -- and a vaccine for -- the particularly virulent strain of influenza. There was a problem, though, in that the book's entire first section was a somewhat tedious historical account of the Johns Hopkins Institute. I'm still not sure why that was necessary (and suspect it wasn't). Granted, it was good to know what the state of medicine was at the turn of the century, but such an overview certainly could have been done more concisely. I also had real issues with the way several medical researchers, and in particular Paul Lewis, were cast into ""roles"" -- with Lewis the tragic figure that the author claimed was ""the last victim"" of the pandemic. Humph!However, I did find it fascinating to read about the details and design of medical research, and in particular how viruses mutated and became more or less deadly. In fact, I wished for a bit more of that information and less of the endless parade of statistics that Barry seemed so inordinately fond of. I came to believe that he had never met a statistic he didn't like (or subsequently use). Again, I was puzzled about why the editors hadn't intervened and winnowed out the repetitious material. Scott Brick, the reader for this book, was one of the biggest irritants, however, and no doubt significantly contributed to my feeling that the book was NEVER going to end. While his voice wasn't an unpleasant one, he seemed to have a very narrow ""range"" of intonation and emphasis. In fact, it sounded like he was overemphasizing just about everything, and he had a particular way of lingering over and stressing the word ""any"" that made me want to shriek after the first few hours. I had a hard time separating my irritation with his reading from my general impatience with the book, which is probably the reason I gave this three stars rather than two -- I'm not entirely sure whose fault it was that I didn't find this as interesting as I'd expected. (Plus, as Forster noted, one DOES tend to overpraise a long book that one finally manages to finish.) If I'd been reading this book rather than listening to it, undoubtedly I would have been able to skim pretty efficiently, slowing down for the parts that interested me the most and just skipping over the repetitive bits. But as a ""captive"" listener, it was pretty tough going. "
251,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/541670-caroline,2,"I had no less than four people come up to me while I was reading this book and tell me how great it was. Apparently it also made quite a splash at USAID when it was published. Maybe that's why three out of the four people who approached me were coworkers.It's possible these endorsements gave me unrealistic expectations, because by the time I finished it I was practically pulling my hair out. Which is a bummer because I was super excited to read The Great Influenza. I love books about medicine and medical history, so it wasn't the subject, it was what story author John Barry chose (tried?) to tell.An anecdote: Occasionally in high school, I would hit a particularly difficult calculus problem and seek out my mechanical engineer father for help. I'd show him the problem, perhaps a particularly pernicious related rate problem. Instead of starting from the problem itself, my dad always wanted to make sure I understood all of the individual concepts required to complete it. The running joke is that if I came to him with a calculus problem, he'd start no later in the material than the formal definition of a derivative and go from there. It would take several chapters worth of content before we arrived at the actual matter at hand. I still enjoy ribbing my dad about his approach to calculus assistance. He's sitting across the room from me right now and when I told him what I was writing he just grinned and declared ""First principles! You must build block by block on first principles!"" Hello, Dad who I've exaggerated for comedic effect, meet John M. Barry.John Barry started this book with Hippocrates and Galen. He then spent 166 pages getting from ancient Greece to the scientific revolution in American medicine that occurred in the early 20th century. He provides painstaking detail surrounding the creation of Johns Hopkins University (to be fair, this was pretty interesting, it's just... not the 1918 influenza pandemic). He introduces a small army of doctors, bacteriologists, and medical researchers, all of whom played a role in dragging medicine into the 20th century via the scientific method.Then, we have a mighty record scratch and Barry decides to spend about 200 pages on the 1918 epidemic itself. The majority of individuals introduced in the first section of the book take a backseat to an almost mind-numbing number of U.S. military cantonments, local and national politicians, and morbidity and mortality statistics. The level of detail is overwhelming and largely made my eyes glaze over. Frustratingly, this part of the book felt almost entirely disconnected from the medical history discussed earlier. Due to the severity of the pandemic, the carefully laboratory work according to the scientific method had to be discarded for shortcuts and best guesses. I figured Barry would highlight this irony and while he mentioned it a time or two, he for the most part just kept barreling forward through the history.Record scratch number two. With the end of the pandemic, we return to a smaller subset of the cast of characters discussed prior to its arrival and follow their lives and research down a number of paths that are only tangentially related (if at all) to influenza. Many of the most important individuals from the first part of the book are discarded without providing any sort of conclusion to their story.The whole thing was immensely aggravating. Whenever I look at a marble sculptures in art museums, I marvel at the fact that a sculptor was able to look at a block of stone, see the figure within, and get rid of the extra to reveal what was there all along. The Great Influenza felt like John M. Barry looking at a block of marble, seeing David, sculpting away, and instead revealing a figure with six arms, two heads, and feet erupting Alien-like from its chest. There are probably two and a half good books contained within, but Barry couldn't see what to get rid of and editor Wendy Wolf certainly didn't take a firm enough hand. I'm genuinely alarmed at the thought of what this book looked like pre-editor after reading the bloated and muddled final result. Here's the kicker: in the acknowledgements, John Barry pulls back the curtain on the process of writing the book and fully reveals his obliviousness. Get a load of this:""This book was initially supposed to be a straightforward story of the deadliest epidemic in human history, told from the perspectives of both scientists who tried to fight it and political leaders who tried to respond to it. I though it would take me two and a half years to write, three at the most. That plan didn't work. Instead this book took seven years to write. It has evolved (and, I hope, grown) into something rather different than originally conceived.""NO JOHN, THE NEW PLAN PLAN DIDN'T WORK. YOU SHOULD HAVE STUCK WITH THE ORIGINAL. Seven years. Holy crud.Other nits to pick: I often felt like Barry had an agenda to push. At various times in the book, he would stake out rather extreme positions and seemed to only approach the history from that angle, with Wilson's approach to World War I and the U.S. military's approach to the pandemic being two of the major examples. Were either perfect? Certainly not, but Barry seemed almost to cast them as the villains of the influenza pandemic, a practice I found unhelpful. I was also distinctly uncomfortable with an insinuation Barry made about the death of Paul A. Lewis. Implying suicide shouldn't be thrown around without evidence, and Barry provided nothing concrete. Not cool, dude.The writing is also nothing to write home about. Barry has an annoying habit of repeating anecdotes throughout the book and if I see the sentence ""It was influenza, only influenza"" one more time, I might scream.It's probably 1.5 stars but I'm rounding up. So why two instead of one? I did learn some things and a number of individual threads in the book were interesting. Highlights include a better understanding of why Johns Hopkins has the reputation it does, what the Hs and Ns are in influenza (ex: the H1N1 strain), and the word enzootic*.In all honesty, though, I'd probably pass on this one. You can learn the bulk of the 1918 influenza-specific stuff more quickly and enjoyably via Wikipedia. *It is to animals what the word ""epidemic"" is to humans, which makes sense given the roots. I'm distinctly less excited about it now, though, having just looked up the pronunciation and realized that it is pronounced en-zoh-AH-tic instead of en-ZOO-tic. I suppose you can't win them all."
252,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3244513-mike,4,"Overall this was a very good book. Expansive, thorough, and at times utterly fascinating. I'm sure people around me are completely sick of me talking about the flu at this point but this is that kind of book that will do that to you. It falls short of getting five stars for a couple of reasons, some of which are about the book but most of which are about me as a reader:1. It's almost too expansive: In Barry's quest to explore every possible nook and cranny of the 1918 Influenza pandemic he leaves no scientific idea or historical actor unearthed and thoroughly discussed. This lends to a skater shot feel to the book as you lurch from one person to another in chronological order with whole chapters about the science of viruses and bacteria popping up here and there to interrupt the forward momentum of the story. I feel like I got a about a dozen very short, somewhat shallow, biographies in this one book and a bit more science that I really wanted. 2. Lack of a supporting personal story or strong main character: When I contrast this book with Steven Johnson's ""Ghost Map"", which is all about John Snow and how he dealt with a cholera outbreak in London in the 19th Century, I find that it didn't hold my attention all the time because I didn't really connect with any of the people in the book or feel like there was a broad narrative that was pulling me along. Sure, he does a good job of showing how the pandemic began, how it peaks, and how it ebbs but the pandemic is far too amorphous for me to really relate to. And while he clearly shows how many of the people in the book react at these different phases I didn't really feel like I got to know any of them with the kind of detail that Johnson pulled out of John Snow.3. Hey, you got your science book in my history book! No, you got your history book in my science book! Wow, they're two great genres that kind of make for a confusing mess when you put them all together: Okay, this gripe is all about me as a reader. I'm WAY more interested in history and politics than science. Unless the science is about robots, zombies, or space ships at a certain point I kind of just zone out. Barry, at times, gets super deep on the science of influenza explaining in great detail how it infects the body and causes no end of problems. While it is a great feat of writing to talk about that sort of thing without losing the reader (to his credit it was never confusing) it doesn't make for a compelling read for me. When Barry talks about history in this book it's completely riveting, I literally couldn't put it down, but then there would be a speed bump science chapter and I'd have to slog through it to get back to the ideas that were the most interesting to me. It made for a frustrating read at times.Over all I would highly recommend this book. It really was quite good, my gripes aside. And, frankly, the historical implications of the book make it worth the read alone (namely that at a crucial junction in the negotiation of the Treaty of Versailles at the end of World War I Pres. Wilson came down with the flu and it, for a bunch of reasons, left him possibly permanently mentally impaired - he believed from that point on that French spies had infiltrated the White House for example - is shocking. Given that that treaty is often held directly responsible for the rise of Nazi Germany, and World War II, and that the principle features of that treaty may have caused the rise of the Nazi's were almost all pushed by the French and opposed by Pres. Wison, until his bought with the flu that is, one is left believing if not for the flu the world could have been very different). If you like science and enjoy history I think this would be a very satisfying reading experience.As an aside, I gave this book to my Grandmother for Christmas in 2009 when she was 91 years old. She and I developed a pattern late in her life of me giving her books that I'd read that I liked for birthdays and Christmas. She was an avid reader and game to read anything, although like me her preferences were more inclined to history, biography, and travel. This was one of the rare books I gave her without reading first. When I asked her, on Christmas 2011, to lend me one of her favorite books she gave me this one. She was born in April of 1918, near the beginning of this book, and I think for her the book explained a lot of things people would mention in her childhood that never made much sense (relatives who died during the flu, particular idioms people would use, or beliefs they had about sickness). She died in March of 2012 just a month shy of 94. In reading this book I am profoundly impressed by her intelligence. This book is not an easy read in spots (there were sections I read twice) and for someone who didn't even finish high school to read this book and not only understand it but enjoy it is a testament to the amazing person she was. This book still has the post-it note she always put on the inside front cover of books she got as gifts with the date, occasion, and person(s) who gave it to her. While she may be gone it makes me happy that she and I could at least share this one last experience together. "

255,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/611813-melinda,4,"Re-reading again in 2020 in the middle of the coronavirus outbreak.This is an excellent book. Reading it in the time of Coronavirus is eye-opening. I wish that the shrill shrieking gerbils of the media would provide comparisons ""per population"" for their numbers, and also comparisons with the traditional flu. The 2nd half of the book is especially worthwhile in this time of pandemic.********I highly recommend this book! It reads like a ""who-done-it"", except that you know who did it (the influenza virus) and you are watching the medical scientists struggle to find solutions while the wild-fire of the 1918 influenza pandemic raged all around them. Will they find a solution in time? (see the bottom paragraph for an answer to this question)Before documenting the path of the 1918 influenza, the author lays the groundwork for the transformed medical atmosphere from the late 1800's into the early 1900's in America. This path thus shows the beginnings of the the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research, the Phipps Institute, and Johns Hopkins University. Names of medical pioneers and influenza warriors such as Paul Lewis (who proved that polio was caused by a virus in 1907 and developed a vaccine that was 100% effective in protecting monkeys), William Henry Welch (the single most powerful individual in the history of American medicine, who directed the rise of Johns Hopkins University, and who with John D. Rockefeller Jr. created the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research, arguablly the best scientific research institute in the world), Simon Flexner (first head of the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research, the man who brought the mortality rate for common bacterial meningitis down to 18% in 1919 WITHOUT antibiotics!), Rufus Cole (who made the Rockefeller Institute Hospital a model for the way clinical research is conducted), Army Surgeon General William Gorgas (whose work in abating the transmission of yellow fever and malaria by controlling the mosquitos saved hundreds of thousands of lives, and allowed construction on the Panama Canal), Oswald Avery (whose work on influenza would lead him to one of the most important scientific discoveries in the 20th century, that DNA is the material of which genes and chromosomes are made), Anna Wessel Williams (the leading female bacteriologist in the world who worked hand in hand with William Park trying to develop a serum or vaccine for influenza),William Park (teamed with Anna Wessel Williams, developed the diptheria antitoxin still in use today), andRichard Shope (who as the first to prove that a virus caused influenza) fill the pages of this book. After setting the stage with its influenza warriors and medical laboratories, the author then begins the saga of the influenza virus itself. Influenza struck in the first wave in the winter and spring of 1918, a mild ""three day fever"" form that most recovered from. The second wave hit in the fall of 1918. This wave was the most virulent and deadly. The third wave hit somewhere in the winter / spring of 1919, and was once again a less virulent form. In just 2 years the virus mutated into a super killer, then back into a more mild disease. In raw numbers, the lowest estimate of the worldwide death toll at the time was 20 million. Knowing what we know now, epidemiologists today estimate that influenza caused at least 50 million and possibly 100 million deaths worldwide. All that in a time when the population of the world was 1/3rd of what it is today. The terrifying aspect of the super killer influenza was that it did not strike the traditional victims... the old and the very young, but instead hit hardest in the age group of 20's and 30's. If the upper estimate of 100 million deaths is accurate, then 8 to 10 percent of all young adults then living were killed by the virus.And these deaths happened with blinding speed. The influenza pandemic stretched out over 2 years. But 2/3rds of the deaths occurred in a period of 24 weeks. That is about 66 million deaths in 24 weeks. Averaged out that would be 2.5 million deaths per week. Yet more than half of those 66 million deaths happened from mid-September to early December of 1918. That is really 33 million deaths in 10 to 12 weeks! That's 3.3 MILLION deaths PER WEEK in the late fall and early winter of 1918! And remember that the world population at the time was less than 1/3rd of what it is today (which is 6.8 billion people). The numbers are just staggering, and I had to keep reading them and figuring out the numbers and it still is a staggering thought. So many died in so short a time! Epidemiological evidence from the work of Dr. Loring Miner seems to show that the new influenza virus originated in Haskell County, Kansas early in the winter of 1918. Dr. Miner documented early cases of the new influenza that showed disturbing mortality rates in a very short period of time. The virus then went to a huge army base in the eastern part of the state as troops were gathered in preparation for their deployment to Europe for WWI. From that army base, soliders were sent to France, soldiers were transferred to other bases in the United States....and the disease began sweeping through North America, Europe, South America, Asia, Africa, and the entire world. Some situations requiring fast decision making in chaotic circumstances were carried out well. Other situations were not handled as well. The ins and outs of these crossing paths of decisions, deaths mounting rapidly, politics, mililtary directives, and newly formed medical laboratories make up the rest of the book. The story is staggering, but gripping. In answer to the question at the beginning of this review, the answer is ""no, the medical scientists did not find a solution during the time of the 1918 thru 1920 influenza pandemic"". They learned alot, yes. They also learned that the only way to be protected from the disease was through isolation from it. Medical practices helping and treating the ill were improved, but a vaccine was never been found. The only reason the killing influenza stopped killing was because it mutated away from the more virulent form into a milder form. So the question immediately to ask is ""what happens if the virus mutates back to the virulent form?"". And that is the question we are left with at the end of the book. In the concluding chapter, the author raises these issues and concludes tentatively that in pandemic times, an authorized power (government, World Health Organization, army, someone) must have the authority to act and to act quickly, and their decisions must trump individual freedoms. Mandatory vaccinations, mandatory quaranatine, mandatory travel restrictions are the things that must be done to protect the larger population. The ""needs of the many outweigh the needs of the one"", if I may quote a Star Trek movie. In times of such overwhelming medical need, quick decisions must be made and sometimes they must be harsh."
256,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2201886-mike,4,"[Since that book deals with epidemic disease, also. In the present there is a virulent influenza outbreak and in the past there is the plague sweeping through England. This book deals with the deadliest outbreak of virulent influenza so far which, at the time, was often thought to be a form of plague (because of extreme cyanosis). Neat, tie-in huh? (hide spoiler)]"
257,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4118002-jeanne,4,"The Great Influenza is a sobering story, especially in today’s climate. This well-researched book gives a detailed account of why this deadly pandemic devastated the world. A well-written history."
258,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10978428-jim,4,"The bodies were piling up. The undertakers, themselves falling sick, were overwhelmed. There was no place to put the bodies. Gravediggers were either sick or refused to bury the influenza victims. Caskets were stacking up...then they ran short of caskets. The city morgue filled up. The stench was terrible...this was Philadelphia, October 1918, the time of the so-called ""Spanish flu."" Barry gives us a panoramic view of the most lethal influenza outbreak in history which occurred in 1918-1919. Today we believe that the death toll in the United States was 675,000 out of a population of 105 million. As many as 100 million died worldwide out of a global population of 1.8 billion, more than 5% of the world's population.  Barry follows the movement of the flu virus across the world, starting in rural Kansas, where somehow the virus crossed the animal-human barrier (from chickens?). It erupted in an Army camp in Kansas and moved east with the soldiers and then went on the troopships with them to Europe...It came in three waves, that first wave that hit the soldiers in the spring of 1918 was rather mild. But then in the fall, there was the second wave that was much more virulent--that's when most of the deaths occurred. Then the virus mutated again and there was a third wave which hit places like Australia--which had not been hit so hard by the second wave. Much of the book is involved with the story of the scientists battling the virus. Barry goes into some detail about this and focuses on some key figures. As he explains, a revolution had occurred in American medicine where labs had been organized and work was going on with the expectation that disease could be conquered by modern science. When it came to the great influenza, science failed. We are still living with the consequences of that.  The book was published in 2004 and, in it, Barry warns that we will face another pandemic. It's only a question of when. He states that we are NOT prepared for a pandemic. The events of this year of 2020 shows that he was right."

People who were young and strong were the most likely to die. In the US, 650,000 people died. The average life expectancy in the US went down by 10 years. Worldwide, perhaps 100 million people died. And yet, it was only the flu. Even today, 90 years after the epidemic, it kills 36,000 Americans in a typical year and we are hardly more prepared to face another epidemic.John M. Barry has written a fascinating account of the influenza epidemic of 1918. But the book is a lot more than just a review of the flu. Barry starts out by examining the state of the American health system at the time of the epidemic and how it reached that state. He explores the revolutionary changes to medicine that occurred in the late 19th and early 20th century and the people who led those changes. He shows us why, even today, a cure for influenza is beyond our reach, explaining in layman’s terms how the influenza virus changes to become deadly and changes again to lose that deadliness. He explains how an endemic virus can lead to an epidemic of unimagined proportions.Barry also shows how the demands of World War I on troop movements, the propaganda campaigns to keep morale high, and the failure of leaders to listen to the doctors and researchers led to a killing field of historic size. His account tends to concentrate on Philadelphia because the city was hit extremely hard and much of the research going on was near that city but he does cover other areas around the world hit hard by the virus, although his coverage of the flu outside of the US is sketchy at best. He gives us writings from diaries and newspaper articles to show what was actually happening and how the media tried to downplay the epidemic. He gives us detailed accounts of the research (and the researchers) that was done to fight the epidemic, explains why this research was mostly unsuccessful, and does it all in a way that is easy to understand even if you don’t have a medical degree.Barry likes to use foreshadowing, hints of what is to come, to keep the reader’s interest and it does work, even if it is a bit melodramatic. Even the chapter titles, “The Tinderbox”, “It Begins”, The Race”, provide some melodrama to the story. The book mostly moves at a good pace and I found myself having trouble putting it down. Barry has written a book that everyone should read, whether you are familiar with the epidemic or not. It is a fascinating, terrifying, detailed, and extremely important book."
260,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8298053-colleen-browne,3,"This book starts out with a summary of medicine from Hippocrates to the First World War. That seems like it would be a long slog but because there was so little advancement during that time, it is done fairly quickly. As a reader with very limited knowledge of the history of medicine, I found this very interesting. What I didn't know at the beginning of the book was that the better part of the book was spent with the author going off on tangents only peripherally related to the pandemic. There is a great deal of information in this book, too much information. This book could have done with a good editor. The length of the book was about the same length as most of the books I read, and in many cases, much shorter but it didn't feel that way. It felt much longer. Barry's use of metaphor was helpful in explaining his subject and his style of writing wasn't awful as many reviewers have charged but he didn't seem to know when to stop on those threads that he followed out to what felt like oblivion at times. This is the first book I have read devoted to the subject (and may be the last). I could not recommend this book; at least not to anyone just interested in the pandemic. I can only suppose that there are better books on the topic."

263,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68316850-gavin,3,"Rousing history of one of the worst things that has ever happened: the 1918 outbreak of H1N1 flu. It focusses particularly on the great scientists who tried to fight it, none of whom I'd ever heard of. Also a meditation on epistemology, the modern mind, & the redemptive meaning of science for beasts like us.Barry senses that the headline result - one-third of the entire world infected, with 
25-100
 million dead - doesn't get enough of a rise from us. The numbers are numbing. So he couches it in modern shocking terms:
 It killed more people in twenty-four weeks than AIDS has killed in twenty-four years, more in a year than the Black Death killed in a century.
Or ten thousand 9/11s. It's worth belabouring this, because we have a weird habit of paying far more attention to human threats than natural ones, even when natural ones are far worse. (Witness our terrorism prevention budgets compared to our infectious disease control budgets, when the latter is a thousand times more lethal.)So: The 1918 flu was worse than the entire First World War: 40+ million died of flu compared with 17 million dead from war; 500 million lives damaged by flu vs 41 million lives by war. 3% of everyone alive died of flu, including about 8% of young adults(!).Except it's hard to separate the War and the pandemic. The virus was spread everywhere by unprecedented numbers of troops, and by the massive supply convoys it induced, and by the War's other human displacements. We don't know how many of the pneumonia deaths only occurred because of the logistical degradation, poverty and pestilence of wartime. There are terrible nonlinearities involved in overcrowding and global movement of troops. But add millions at least to the overall death toll caused by WWI.The book is in the epic mode, all the way through. (That's not a straightforward compliment.) I liked it, but I understand if it's a bit American for you:
Man might be defined as “modern” largely to the extent that he attempts to control nature. In this relationship with nature, modern humanity has generally been the aggressor, and a daring one at that, altering the flow of rivers, building upon geological faults, and, today, even engineering the genes of existing species. Nature has generally been languid in its response, although contentious once aroused and occasionally displaying a flair for violence.By 1918 humankind was fully modern, and fully scientific, but too busy fighting itself to aggress against nature. Nature, however, chooses its own moments. It chose this moment to aggress against man, and it did not do so prodding languidly. For the first time, modern humanity, a humanity practicing the modern scientific method, would confront nature in its fullest rage.
There's a long prelude describing how terrible medicine was up to the 20th Century. Medicine was ""the withered arm of science"". Therapeutic nihilism (that is, ""we can't really do anything"") was the only rational view, replacing millenia of Galenic woo.
Stengel reviewed dozens of ideas advanced in medical journals. Gargles of various disinfectants. Drugs. Immune sera. Typhoid vaccine. Diphtheria antitoxin. But Stengel’s message was simple: This doesn’t work. That doesn’t work. Nothing worked... Nothing they were doing worked.
Problem is, this rational scepticism created a powerful vacuum: humans need to believe something can heal, and the gap was filled with worse. Some confabulated gremlins from this time haunt us still: homeopathy, chiropractic, naturopathy, Christian Science, and (though Barry doesn't include them) the organic farming movement and psychoanalysis.Few people come off well. Even among the scientists, we get a horrible example of perverse priors and premature updating: an enormous proportion of all scientific resources were devoted to fighting the wrong pathogen, due to a bad guess by an extremely eminent researcher.Because so much of the state was occupied in war, in places there was wholesale social collapse:
In Philadelphia meanwhile fear came and stayed. Death could come from anyone, anytime. People moved away from others on the sidewalk, avoided conversation; if they did speak, they turned their faces away to avoid the other person’s breathing. The impossibility of getting help compounded the isolation. 850 Philadelphia doctors and more nurses were away in the military. More than that number were sick. Philadelphia General Hospital had 126 nurses. Despite all precautions, despite wearing surgical masks and gowns, eight doctors and fifty-four nurses—43 percent of the staff—themselves required hospitalization. Ten nurses at this single hospital died. The Board of Health pleaded for help from retired nurses and doctors if they remembered “even a little” of their profession.When a nurse or doctor or policeman did actually come, they wore their ghostly surgical masks, and people fled them. In every home where someone was ill, people wondered if the person would die. And someone was ill in every home...Starr went to Emergency Hospital #2 at Eighteenth and Cherry Streets. He did have help, if it could be called that, from an elderly physician who had not practiced in years and who brought Starr into touch with the worst of heroic medicine. Starr wouldn’t forget that, the ancient arts of purging, of venesection, the ancient art of opening a patient’s vein. But for the most part he and the other students elsewhere were on their own, with little help even from nurses, who were so desperately needed that in each of ten emergency hospitals supplied by the Red Cross only a single qualified nurse was available to oversee whatever women came as volunteers. And often the volunteers reported for their duty once and, from either fear or exhaustion, did not come again.Nearly 1/4 of all the patients in his hospital died each day. Starr would go home, and when he returned the next day, he would find that between one-quarter and one-fifth of the patients in the hospital had died, replaced by new ones... Virtually all of them, along with their friends and relatives, were terrified that, no matter how mild the symptoms seemed at first, within them moved an alien force, a seething, spreading infection, a live thing with a will that was taking over their bodies — and could be killing them...The city was frozen with fear, frozen into stillness. Starr lived 12 miles from the hospital. The streets were silent on his drive home, silent. They were so silent he took to counting the cars he saw. One night he saw no cars at all. He thought, “The life of the city had almost stopped.”
Everyone can read the collapse of official power in Philadelphia as supporting their politics. Anarchists can point to the benevolent spontaneous order that arose after the corrupt local government failed to act; libertarians can point out that this spontaneous order was all funded by the richest Philadelphians; statists can point out that, without actually-authoritative co-ordination, the effort eventually failed, because people defected against each other, in fear.
The corpses had backed up at undertakers’, filling every area of these establishments and pressing up into living quarters; in hospital morgues overflowing into corridors; in the city morgue overflowing into the street. And they had backed up in homes. They lay on porches, in closets, in corners of the floor, on beds. Children would sneak away from adults to stare at them, to touch them; a wife would lie next to a dead husband, unwilling to move him or leave him. The corpses, reminders of death and bringers of terror or grief, lay under ice at Indian-summer temperatures. Their presence was constant, a horror demoralizing the city; a horror that could not be escaped. Finally the city tried to catch up to them.The police wore their ghostly surgical masks, and people fled them, but the masks had no effect on the viruses and by mid-October thirty-three policemen had died, with many more to follow... More coffins came by rail, guarded by men with guns.
""There is, therefore, but one response possible from us: Force! force to the utmost, force without stint or limit, the righteous and triumphant force which shall make right the law of the world and cast every selfish dominion down in the dust. ""- Woodrow Wilson addressing one of his money-lending mobs.Wilson tends to be viewed pretty positively, just because he won. (""at last the world knows America as the savior of the world!"") But he perverted an entire state and nation to do so, ignored the terrible suffering of his own damn population for years, and refused a conditional peace with Austria in August and with the Kaiser's new parliament in September. (This meant 30-70 extra days of war, which, if this period was as lethal as the rest of the war, means up to 800,000 completely unnecessary deaths, not to mention the continuing waste of resources during the worst epidemic ever). Wilson did great evil, was not much different from the Kaiser, the election aside.
 the military suctioned more and more nurses and physicians into cantonments, aboard ships, into France, until it had extracted nearly all the best young physicians. Medical care for civilians deteriorated rapidly. The doctors who remained in civilian life were largely either incompetent young ones or those over forty-five years of age, the vast majority of whom had been trained in the old ways of medicine. 
Barry's middle chapters are a frightening portrait of how rabidly un-American the US was in 1918. The laws were bad enough - for instance the ban on criticising the government. But then there's the unofficial ""patriotic duties"", punishable by beatings. State-sponsored atavism.
By the summer of 1918, however, Wilson had injected the government into every facet of national life and had created great bureaucratic engines to focus all the nation’s attention and intent on the war.He had created a Food Administration to control and distribute food, a Fuel Administration to ration coal and gasoline, a War Industries Board to oversee the entire economy. He had taken all but physical control over the railroads and had created a federally sponsored river barge line that brought commerce back to life on the Mississippi River, a commerce that had been killed by competition from those railroads. He had built many dozens of military installations, each of which held at least tens of thousands of soldiers or sailors. He had created industries that made America’s shipyards teem with hundreds of thousands of laborers launching hundreds of ships, dug new coal mines to produce coal for the factories that weaned America’s military from British and French weapons and munitions—for, unlike in World War II, America was no arsenal of democracy.He had created a vast propaganda machine, an internal spy network, a bond-selling apparatus... He had even succeeded in stifling speech, in the summer of 1918 arresting and imprisoning — some for prison terms longer than ten years —not just radical labor leaders and editors of German-language newspapers but powerful men, even a congressman.He had injected the government into American life in ways unlike any other in the nation’s history. And the final extension of federal power had come only in the spring of 1918, after the first wave of influenza had begun jumping from camp to camp, when the government expanded the draft from males between the ages of twenty-one and thirty to those between the ages of eighteen and forty-five. Only on May 23, 1918, had Provost Marshal Enoch Crowder, who oversaw the draft, issued his “work or fight” order, stating that anyone not employed in an essential industry would be drafted...Crowder bragged about doing “in a day what the Prussian autocracy had been spending nearly fifty years to perfect...""In mid-August, as the lethal wave of the epidemic was gathering itself, Austria had already inquired about peace terms, an inquiry that Wilson rebuffed utterly. And as the epidemic was gathering full momentum, peace was only weeks away. Bulgaria had signed an armistice on September 29. On September 30, Kaiser Wilhelm had granted parliamentary government to the German nation; that same day Ludendorff had warned his government that Germany must extend peace feelers or disaster—immediate disaster—would follow. German diplomats sent out those feelers. Wilson ignored them. The Central Powers, Germany and her allies, were simultaneously breaking off one from one another and disintegrating internally as well. In the first week of October, Austria and Germany separately sent peace feelers to the Allies, and on October 7, Austria delivered a diplomatic note to Wilson formally seeking peace on any terms Wilson chose. Ten days later — days of battle and deaths — the Austrian note remained unanswered.Earlier Wilson had spoken of a “peace without victory,” believing only such a peace could last. But now he gave no indication that the war would soon be over. Although a rumor that the war had ended sent thrills through the nation, Wilson quickly renounced it. Nor would he relent. He was not now fighting to the death; he was fighting only to kill...If Wilson and his government would not be turned from his end even by the prospect of peace, they would hardly be turned by a virus. And the reluctance, inability, or outright refusal of the American government to shift targets would contribute to the killing. Wilson took no public note of the disease, and the thrust of the government was not diverted. The relief effort for influenza victims would find no assistance in the Food Administration or the Fuel Administration or the Railroad Administration. From neither the White House nor any other senior administration post would there come any leadership, any attempt to set priorities, any attempt to coordinate activities, any attempt to deliver resources....the military would give no help to civilians. Instead it would draw further upon civilian resources. The same day that Welch had stepped out of the autopsy room at Devens and called Gorgas’s office, his warning had been relayed to the army chief of staff, urging that all transfers be frozen unless absolutely necessary and that under no circumstances transfers from infected camps be made... Gorgas’s superiors ignored the warning. There was no interruption of movement between camps whatsoever; not until weeks later, with the camps paralyzed and, literally, tens of thousands of soldiers dead or dying, did the army make any adjustments.
Because the disease was everywhere, ravaging the entire species (and beyond), the book can't cover everything. Very little is said about non-Americans, i.e about 98% of the death and chaos. This is partly because there just isn't a lot of evidence about them, despite their influenza immunity and medical care being even worse. (This is why the top estimates reach 100m deaths, three times the median estimate.) Here is a passage about just a tiny number of them, in the north:
In Alaska, whites protected themselves. Sentries guarded all trails, and every person entering the city was quarantined for five days. Eskimos had no such luck. A senior Red Cross official warned that without “immediate medical assistance the race” could become “extinct.”...The navy provided the collier USS Brutus to carry a relief expedition... They found terrible things. One doctor visited ten tiny villages and found “three wiped out entirely; others average 85% deaths… Survivors generally children… probably 25% frozen to death before help arrived.”The virus probably did not kill all of them directly. But it struck so suddenly it left no one well enough to care for any others, no one to get food, no one to get water. And those who could have survived, surrounded by bodies, bodies of people they loved, might well have preferred to go where their family had gone, might well have wanted to no longer be alone... Two hundred sixty-six people had lived in Okak, and many dogs, dogs nearly wild. When the virus came, it struck so hard so fast people could not care for themselves or feed the dogs. The dogs grew hungry, crazed with hunger, devoured each other, then wildly smashed through windows and doors, and fed... In all of Labrador, at least one-third the total population died. 
---Barry commits at least one big error: he's horrified by the medical schools of the time having ""no standards for admission"":
 In research and education especially, American medicine lagged far behind [European medicine]... At least one hundred US medical schools would accept any man willing to pay tuition... and only a single medical school required its student to have a college degree... the Johns Hopkins itself, not student fees, paid [its] faculty salaries, and it required medical students to have not only a college degree but fluency in French and German and a background of science courses. 
But his enthusiasm for Johns Hopkins introducing the college degree requirement is misplaced. Contemporary US doctors (who all have 3 years of pre-med, or even more college, before they start medical training) are probably no better clinicians than undergraduate doctors in other countries, and are far further in debt. This requirement is probably one reason the American system is so fucked.I suppose Barry is just confusing the open admissions situation with the schools' appallingly low graduation standards, which is certainly one reason eC20th medicine sucked. (Many doctors had never looked down a microscope, never used a stethoscope on a patient, never seen a dissection.)---PS: Mostly unimportant corrections by a virologist here. Reply to these from Barry here."
264,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22063432-tom-mathews,5,"The old adage that 'those who fail to learn from the past are condemned to repeat it' has never been so true. President George W. Bush read this book shortly after it was published and was so impressed by the threat of future pandemics that he commissioned a department whose sole function was to prepare for future pandemics. This involved cooperation by federal, state and international entities (such as the WHO) to set up surveillance networks for potentially deadly diseases and to stockpile drugs and equipment such as mechanical ventilators that could be used in the event of a sharp spike in the number of inpatient hospitalizations. Unfortunately, the current president quickly defunded and essentially disbanded all of President Bush's efforts to prepare for what scientists and even foresighted politicians knew was inevitable. In his book, Barry wrote of the things that people did to protect themselves in 1918-19 and recommendations for what we could do when the next pandemic occurred. There was actually very few differences between the two lists: masks, hand-washing, social distancing and the cancelling of large gatherings being prominent on both lists. Barry asserted that our greatest chance of preventing a full-scale calamity lay in forethought and preparation. We will never know if that would have had much of an impact. When Barry wrote this book he likely couldn't have foreseen the political situation the U.S. finds itself in today but he knew politicians. He knew that in order to avoid boosting the enemy's morale in wartime, our leaders refused to speak honestly about the seriousness of the influenza pandemic and, as a result, millions died. But if he thought that politicians today were any better, he likely wouldn't have written in the afterward of one edition ""On a larger scale, and far more difficult, will be getting governments to tell the truth about the disease. This is perhaps the biggest lesson about 1918 and it is a lesson not yet learned.""I try to avoid revealing spoilers in my reviews but these are unusual times and I think that the best way to close this review is to let Barry do it for me. Here are the closing paragraphs in this magnificent work:
So the final lesson of 1918, a simple one yet one most difficult to execute, is that those who occupy positions of authority must lessen the panic that can alienate all within a society. Society cannot function if it is every man for himself. By definition, civilization cannot survive that. Those in authority must retain the public’s trust. The way to do that is to distort nothing, to put the best face on nothing, to try to manipulate no one. Lincoln said that first, and best. A leader must make whatever horror exists concrete. Only then will people be able to break it apart.

266,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4739424-mal-warwick,5,"A century ago a pandemic disease far more lethal than COVID-19 killed an estimated fifty to one hundred million people around the world—as many as one out of every twenty people then alive. The 1918 flu epidemic erupted during a war that had already killed tens of millions and at a time when medical science was far less accomplished than it is today. Although there are lessons to learn for our response to COVID-19, it’s important to view what happened then in its historical context. And that’s the approach John M. Barry so brilliantly takes in The Great Influenza. This engrossing book may well be one of the very best ever written on medical history.The historical context of the 1918 flu epidemicAs Barry makes clear, medical science had taken big steps forward in the decades before the pandemic erupted, especially in the United States. Half a century earlier, German researchers, and French to a lesser extent, led the world in medical research. However, by the outbreak of World War I, two institutions had spearheaded immense advances in American medicine: Johns Hopkins Hospital and the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research (later Rockefeller University).Johns Hopkins Hospital, founded in 1889, had been established expressly to bring the scientific method into the teaching and practice of medicine in the United States. The Rockefeller Institute set out from day one to become the world’s most important medical research institution, and many observers have expressed the opinion that it succeeded very shortly after its establishment in 1901. Barry traces the evolution of both Johns Hopkins and the Rockefeller (as they were then known) through in-depth sketches of the prominent physicians who led them. Those doctors, the heroes of the tale, played leadership roles in combating the 1918 flu epidemic, advising the military and government at all levels on precautionary measures and researching the origins of the disease and possible treatment. Unfortunately, they made little headway in either respect.Why the disease spread so widely and so quicklyThe doctors’ increasingly strident insistence on warning the public about the epidemic were met with rigid resistance until hundreds of thousands of Americans had already died. The Wilson administration had instituted draconian measures to prevent any news from reaching the public that would turn its attention from the need to support the war effort. Although press censorship was not in force, the nation’s press almost uniformly self-censored, parroting the official line that the disease was not serious while bodies piled up in the morgues. The result then, as it is today in the COVID-19 pandemic, was that those who denied the problem lost the public’s trust. But the biggest reason the influenza spread so widely and so quickly was the insistence of the US Army on transferring troops in large numbers from one base to another in crowded trains and then overseas in crowded ships.The 1918 flu epidemic was “the deadliest pandemic in history”Although up to five percent of the world’s population—and “as many as 8 to 10 percent of all young adults then living—died from the so-called “Spanish influenza,” its impact was not limited to the appalling death toll. Naturally, the pandemic greatly influenced the course of medical research and the adoption of public health measures far more widely than had been the case. But its consequences were far-reaching both in the conduct of World War I and in the shape of the peace that emerged from the conflict. Barry skillfully explores both themes in The Great Influenza.How the epidemic helped defeat GermanyIn April 1918, German commander Erich Ludendorff began “his last great offensive—Germany’s last real chance to win the war. The . . . offensive made great initial gains.” But then it stalled. Barry quotes the diary of a US Army surgeon stationed near the front: “‘The expected third phase of the great German offensive gets put off from day to day . . . I gather that the epidemic of grippe which hit us rather hard in Flanders also hit the Boche worse, and this may have caused the delay.'” In fact, Ludendorff himself “blamed influenza for the loss of initiative and the ultimate failure of the offensive.” No single battle necessarily changes the course of any war (although Midway, Stalingrad, and the Normandy Invasion are all claimed to have done just that in the next war.) But contemporary observers in 1918, and military analysts now, seem to agree that however slim the likelihood that Germany might end up victorious was certainly then lost.How the 1918 flu epidemic helped cause World War IIHistorians agree that the Treaty of Versailles that brought World War I to a close was a disaster. The excessive pain it imposed on Germany is almost universally acknowledged to have led in virtually a straight line to the Second World War. Yet that treaty took the form it did only because, midway through the peace conference, the world’s most popular statesman, Woodrow Wilson, suddenly and unaccountably “abandoned principles he had previously insisted upon. He yielded to [French Prime Minister Georges] Clemenceau everything of significance Clemenceau wanted, virtually all of which Wilson had earlier opposed.” Clemenceau was the primary architect of the harsh provisions incorporated into the treaty.Most accounts of Wilson’s strange turnabout at Versailles ascribe it to a minor stroke he suffered. The President was, in fact, in his sickbed when he made the fateful decision. However, Barry cites powerful evidence that Wilson had not in fact suffered a stroke. He had the flu. “Wilson’s actual symptoms—including high fever, severe coughing, and total prostration, [were] all symptoms that perfectly fit influenza and have no association whatsoever with stroke . . . Indeed, the virus may have contributed to the [severe] stroke” Wilson suffered much later that incapacitated him and led to his death.Where the “Spanish flu” really originatedWithin months of its appearance in the United States, the 1918 flu epidemic quickly went pandemic throughout Western Europe. The “Great War” was in its final months at the time, and rigid press censorship was in force on both sides of the trenches. Thus, even though thousands of American, French, British, and German troops were falling ill throughout the war zone, no news about their plight reached the home front in any one of the combatant countries. Neutral Spain, however, was different. There, alarmist reports about the virulence of the fast-spreading disease were splashed all over front pages. And that was how the epidemic came to be dubbed the “Spanish flu.”In fact, as Barry reports in detail, the deadly strain of H1N1 influenza at the heart of the 1918 flu epidemic almost certainly originated in Haskell County, Kansas, early that year. From there, the disease made its way eastward to a huge army “cantonment” where tens of thousands of troops were preparing to be shipped to France as cannon fodder for “Black Jack” Pershing‘s push against the German lines. Tens of thousands never made it there, falling victim instead to the flu. And, in carrying the disease to Europe, they triggered its spread to both Allied and enemy troops as well as civilian populations throughout Western Europe and ultimately to the rest of the world.How the 1918 flu epidemic was different from COVID-19In two major respects, the pandemic of a century ago differed significantly from what we are experiencing as I write:** Influenza is a respiratory disease that primarily attacks the lungs, nose, and throat. When it kills, it does so primarily through pneumonia. Although COVID-19 was initially feared to be similar in its effects, it is in truth a vascular disease that manifests through the circulatory system. ** It’s difficult for scientists to calculate the mortality (death) rate of a disease. But it is clear that the H1N1 influenza virus that emerged in 1918 was far more lethal than the COVID-19 strains that have been seen to date. Hundreds of thousands are dying today. Eventually, it seems likely that globally millions will do so. But it seems highly unlikely that the death toll will rise into the tens of millions as was the case a century ago.However, there is one significant way in which the two pandemics are similar. History tends to refer to the earlier pandemic as the “1918 flu epidemic,” suggesting that a first, relatively mild strain broke out in the spring of that year, followed by a second, far more lethal strain in the fall. In fact, though, the second wave lasted until 1919—and there was a third wave in 1920. Medical researchers tell us that COVID-19 is almost certain to behave in a similar fashion. As I write, we are experiencing either the first or the second wave of the disease (the experts differ). Yet another outbreak seems certain, with or without the speedy development of a vaccine—polyannish predictions to the contrary notwithstanding."

Outside of these few very well-known accounts, there is almost nothing in literature about it afterwards. They write about horrors that people inflict on people. Apparently they forget the horrors that nature inflicts on people, the horrors that make humans least significant. And yet the pandemic resonated.” Times like these only help us get perspective, Human race suffers from Amnesia and keeps forgetting the one and biggest truth of all. As Nietzsche's said - ""In some remote corner of the universe, poured out and glittering in innumerable solar systems, there once was a star on which clever animals invented knowledge. That was the highest and most mendacious minute of ""world history""—yet only a minute. After nature had drawn a few breaths the star grew cold, and the clever animals had to die."" We are nothing but a speck of dust in the grand scheme of things and times like these keep reminding us that. But times likes also explain why we are most thriving species on the earth today. We have invented these abstract concepts of ""Love"" , ""Compassion"" and ""Hope"" and that's what defines us. At the end this will be over I hope we are able to learn something out of this. This is an amazing read in my mind. The book not just telling the story of the pandemic but the foundations of the medical science in America. The author has done an amazing job covering different aspect of those times and I can certainly draw similarities in the current ongoing situations. It has definitely given me perspective. Help me interpret the media ( social/news) and conceive a bigger picture. "

The early history of the practice medicine in this country and lack of training of the doctors was jaw dropping. During WWI, academic instruction in general suffered due to total commitment to the war effort. ""In view of the comparatively short time during which most of the student-soldiers will remain in college and the exacting military duties awaiting them, academic instruction must necessarily be modified along the lines of direct military value.""I appreciated the great detail used in explaining the scientific rigor in trying to understand the disease that was plaguing the country and world.

I don't know if it's poorly-written or poorly-edited, but there were places were the same thing was said within pages of each other. And boring?!? Honestly, I was looking for a book about the flu to read during flu-season (especially in the year I decided NOT to get the flu shot), and all we get is lengthy biographies about the doctors and people who... well, I'm not even sure how most of them are important to the story. Really, when you pick up a book about a deadly disease you want to read about the deadly disease, and not wait for a couple hundred pages for it to appear or get good. The book is going back on the shelf but I guess I'll leave my bookmark where it is, just in case I get really bored."
270,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72479728-bryan-alkire,3,"Turned out to be ok, but given my high expectations for the book, ultimately disappointing. Before I get talk about the book itself, I’d like to say a few words about the peril of popular historical analogy. Really, this current Corona virus and the 1918 flu are not equivalent. Different diseases different times different responses. For starters, 1918 was a war economy. If people had chirped about lack of toilet paper or individual rights to be out and about, they would have been swiftly muzzled. Second, the government involvement at the federal level was vastly different. In 1918 the federal government did absolutely nothing, tot even brave words of comfort, for civilians suffers the flu. Today the government is throwing massive amounts of money at the problem even if it is at the behest of business special interests. At least the government is trying something. In fact, the only thing similar is that local governments are bearing the brunt of the response and that said response is a patchwork and that the media is following local government lead, in 1918 largely silent about the danger, in 2020 loudly proclaiming from the rooftops about the dangers. The last difference is the most important, different diseases. The 1918 flu struck quickly with a 48 to 72-hour incubation period and often killed suddenly as short as 12 hours after symptoms largely because the body’s immune system had to mount such a vigorous defense that if killed the body in the process. This corona virus is a two-week incubation period and seems to be more of a slow and more predictable killer.  Hopefully you’re still reading at this point as I will now discuss the book. I like books on pandemics when I can find them. They’re interesting and often draw lessons, usually for apocalypse writers, but unfortunately, real life currently. I chose this book because it’s the popular definitive work on the 1918 flu and that’s where the book falls short. The The organization of this book is just bad. It’s a confusing narrative structure with no real timeline and constant doubling back and forth interspersed with chapters on diseases and the like. It’s extremely repetitive. The writing is uneven. Sometimes it slows admirably and at other times gets bogged down in statistics and detail. The book also becomes awfully dry at times, particularly when discussing diseases themselves in quite detailed fashion. The content is also uneven. There’s lots here which isn’t truly relevant like medical school history and the life stories of doctors whose insolvent with the flu was more administrate than actual work. In short, this book was just a mess and clearly there was no good editing done on it. This book could have been a lot better than it was. So, I give this a 3. It’s interesting and at times, quite readable and even compelling. But, it’s dismally organized and edited. It could have been much better. "
271,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12087691-wendyb,5," A must-read book for the times we live in.Starts out with maybe just a little too much background on some of the doctors involved in the 1918 flu research but still interesting info on the state of medicine at that time.Got really interesting with the info on the start of the flu and the effect on the population.In researching my family background, I discovered my grandparents' first child died in Oct 1918 of the Spanish Flu at just 12 days old.

272,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5364077-connie-g,4,"The great influenza pandemic of 1918-1920 killed between 20 to 100 million people worldwide, more fatalities than any other pandemic in history. Unlike most influenza, this one targeted young people in their 20s and 30s. Although it's called the Spanish flu because the Spanish press had extensive coverage of the disease, it's thought to have originated in Kansas. Soldiers carried the disease as they traveled between crowded military facilities, then crossed the Atlantic on crowded boats to fight in World War I.Author John M. Barry also writes about the advances in medical education and medical research in the United States which occurred just before the pandemic. The Johns Hopkins Medical School and the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research were highlighted. He goes into great detail describing the lives and work of the medical researchers. While the pandemic was raging, researchers were not able to identify the viral pathogen, and many thought that the bacteria causing secondary infections was responsible. The book contains excellent descriptions of how a virus attacks human cells and replicates in the body. The mutation of viruses and the development of vaccines are also discussed.Barry also writes about the way politics and misinformation from public officials exacerbated the pandemic of 1918. Although the book was written in 2004, it has warnings that are important today during the COVID crisis. This timely book is interesting and well researched, although some readers may find there is too much detail about the medical schools and researchers."
273,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2190636-joselito-honestly-and-brilliantly,5,"The 1918 Flu Pandemic coincided with the First World War and it killed more than both the military and civilian casualties of the conflict yet while the war generated an avalanche of literature (poems, songs, music, fiction, films, biographies and autobiographies) not much serious work had been done about this pandemic until this book published in 2004.I read this a few years back and I’ve disposed of my copy already but since it was a gripping, unforgettable read, I could still recall some tidbits of information about this 1918 pandemic in relation with what we are now experiencing during the present one.First of all, and this is what is often found to be the most surprising about whatever virus was it which caused the 1918 pandemic, the most vulnerable was those who were physically fit and at the prime of their lives (think those in their 20’s or 30’s who eat healthy and go to the gym). Contrast this with with most of the present Covid 19 fatalities who are old and who had pre-existing health issues. But why is that? For some reasons, the body’s immune system or antibodies react to the 1918 virus in a weird way. They overreact or overdo things. The analogy is that when a fly (the virus) enters a house (the human body) someone drops an atom bomb (the antibodies) on it to kill the fly and because of it even the house is completely destroyed. So that is why it was the healthy and the strong who mostly died: they were the ones with stronger antibodies.Secondly, the incubation period for the 1918 virus was apparently shorter. I think there was a story in the book about someone talking gaily on a street, apparently healthy, then in just an hour or so would die there in that same place. Or a bus of healthy-looking people stopping before it reaches its destination because its driver (with 6 of its passengers) dropping dead.The 1918 pandemic killed about 100 Million people worldwide. No one knew how it was stopped. Probably it just got tired of killing people."

The book is very dry to read. The writing is repetitive and it drags on and on. Part 1 is the development of American medical science (public health study, John Hopkins Medical School etc...). Part 2 is mostly US politics (Woodrow Wilson, WWI and how wartime censorship was implemented). The rest is about the pandemic. The book should be better titled as ""The Great Influenza and How the US Dealt With It"", because it covers only a little outside the United States.At least 50m people (5% world population) had been wiped out by the pandemic, which is equivalent to 390m people today. There were three waves in the pandemic, the second wave the worst. In US, the condition in East Coast was worse than the west coast. San Francisco managed relatively well among big cities in US. Scientists did not find out the pathogen until many years later. The genome of the virus was sequenced in 2005.What strikes me most is that how the US politics today regarding Covid-19 has much in common with what happened in the 1918-1919 pandemic.

278,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35645863-lena,5,"Beyond five stars. How many books are entertaining, important, engaging and edifying? I can only think of one, this one.  I thought this was going to read like a thriller by Michael Crichton or Dan Brown following a plucky single doctor who fights hard for his patients, makes a breakthrough, and saves the day. That's not this book because that's definitely not what happened. The book starts off with a history of medicine. I had a vague idea about this beginning with Hypocrites and then jumping to those bleeders in Period dramas that announce, ""He's not long for this world."" with much in between. But there wasn't much in between and that's the problem.    While the other sciences moved in leaps and bounds medicine did not. There were lightbulbs and trains and the doctor was still coming to bleed you. Barry gives two reasons for this stagnation. The first is the anathema of autopsy. For the longest time it was simply unthinkable to cut into and examine a human being, it was too close to butchers work. Then there was a religious stigma attached but even in the twentieth century the liberal gods spoke out against it. Hell, even today hardened cops don't like attending autopsies.The second reason is a little trickier to understand - medicine is not logical like the other sciences. Barry gives an excellent example. A doctor in the early 1900s noticed that the face flushed during fever so he reasoned that fever could be a capillary issue. To test his theory he bled his fever patients. They went pale, their temperature dropped, and they were ravenous for food and drink. A cure! He published his finding, which was easily replicated, and was much lauded by the medical community. It was perfectly logical. It was wrong. Due to this reputation for butchery, witchery, and general ineffectiveness, being a doctor was not a respected profession. Medical schools were shockingly bad pass/fail systems where teacher salaries were based on butts in seats. Things changed quickly when they changed and you'll have to read the book to find out. This was the first book I read in 2016 and here I sit on the last evening of the year trying to finish this review. It was not mere procrastination; I was daunted by how much I enjoyed, learned, and was affected by this book. I became a vegetarian for four months and switched out all my beauty products to the more expensive cruelty free lines. And that was not even the point of the book. This entire review and I haven't even mentioned the word flu. Sigh. Just read it. *special thanks to my 2015 Secret Santa Krystal!"
279,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1649751-florence,4,"This is a very frightening book. We usually consider the flu to be a non life threatening disease. Not true in 1918. The disease killed millions in a worldwide pandemic. The actual number of fatalities can never be known because medical systems were so overwhelmed that many people were dying at home without ever seeing a medical professional. The grisly details of how ordinary people suffered are in this comprehensive book. Also covered are scientific descriptions of bacteria and viruses that a reader without a scientific background can comprehend. The pandemic seemed to be a perfect storm. President Woodrow Wilson was myopically focused on victory overseas as the Great War raged on. He made a fateful decision to send ailing troops to Europe, disregarding the advice of military health experts, exponentially expanding the disease to Europe. It took over 20 years to identify the virus that causes influenza. Initially it is transferred from an animal and has the diabolic ability to rapidly mutate to a form that can be spread among humans. Can a pandemic of this scope occur again? Almost certainly."
280,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/241691-kay,3,"""One always tends to overpraise a long book because one has got through it."" – E.M. ForsterIt took me the better part of the summer to listen to this audiobook in my car (I don't drive that much) -- and I confess that it soon became more of a chore than a pleasure. I do wish there had been a competently edited abridged version, for if ever a book cried out for editing, it was this one. Some of the book's strengths, however, include the exhaustive account of how the pandemic started and spread, not to mention the effect it had on society. There was a huge amount of material on how the authorities (mostly didn't) deal with the crisis, one of the key themes of the book being that in order to deal with such a threat that the civil authorities need to be completely honest about it. Point taken, but it was repeated over and over and over.... as were the somewhat melodramatic accounts of how the bodies stacked up, what having the disease was like, what the death toll was, and so on and so forth. Another strength was the intimate portraits of key researchers who rushed to find the cause of -- and a vaccine for -- the particularly virulent strain of influenza. There was a problem, though, in that the book's entire first section was a somewhat tedious historical account of the Johns Hopkins Institute. I'm still not sure why that was necessary (and suspect it wasn't). Granted, it was good to know what the state of medicine was at the turn of the century, but such an overview certainly could have been done more concisely. I also had real issues with the way several medical researchers, and in particular Paul Lewis, were cast into ""roles"" -- with Lewis the tragic figure that the author claimed was ""the last victim"" of the pandemic. Humph!However, I did find it fascinating to read about the details and design of medical research, and in particular how viruses mutated and became more or less deadly. In fact, I wished for a bit more of that information and less of the endless parade of statistics that Barry seemed so inordinately fond of. I came to believe that he had never met a statistic he didn't like (or subsequently use). Again, I was puzzled about why the editors hadn't intervened and winnowed out the repetitious material. Scott Brick, the reader for this book, was one of the biggest irritants, however, and no doubt significantly contributed to my feeling that the book was NEVER going to end. While his voice wasn't an unpleasant one, he seemed to have a very narrow ""range"" of intonation and emphasis. In fact, it sounded like he was overemphasizing just about everything, and he had a particular way of lingering over and stressing the word ""any"" that made me want to shriek after the first few hours. I had a hard time separating my irritation with his reading from my general impatience with the book, which is probably the reason I gave this three stars rather than two -- I'm not entirely sure whose fault it was that I didn't find this as interesting as I'd expected. (Plus, as Forster noted, one DOES tend to overpraise a long book that one finally manages to finish.) If I'd been reading this book rather than listening to it, undoubtedly I would have been able to skim pretty efficiently, slowing down for the parts that interested me the most and just skipping over the repetitive bits. But as a ""captive"" listener, it was pretty tough going. "
281,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/541670-caroline,2,"I had no less than four people come up to me while I was reading this book and tell me how great it was. Apparently it also made quite a splash at USAID when it was published. Maybe that's why three out of the four people who approached me were coworkers.It's possible these endorsements gave me unrealistic expectations, because by the time I finished it I was practically pulling my hair out. Which is a bummer because I was super excited to read The Great Influenza. I love books about medicine and medical history, so it wasn't the subject, it was what story author John Barry chose (tried?) to tell.An anecdote: Occasionally in high school, I would hit a particularly difficult calculus problem and seek out my mechanical engineer father for help. I'd show him the problem, perhaps a particularly pernicious related rate problem. Instead of starting from the problem itself, my dad always wanted to make sure I understood all of the individual concepts required to complete it. The running joke is that if I came to him with a calculus problem, he'd start no later in the material than the formal definition of a derivative and go from there. It would take several chapters worth of content before we arrived at the actual matter at hand. I still enjoy ribbing my dad about his approach to calculus assistance. He's sitting across the room from me right now and when I told him what I was writing he just grinned and declared ""First principles! You must build block by block on first principles!"" Hello, Dad who I've exaggerated for comedic effect, meet John M. Barry.John Barry started this book with Hippocrates and Galen. He then spent 166 pages getting from ancient Greece to the scientific revolution in American medicine that occurred in the early 20th century. He provides painstaking detail surrounding the creation of Johns Hopkins University (to be fair, this was pretty interesting, it's just... not the 1918 influenza pandemic). He introduces a small army of doctors, bacteriologists, and medical researchers, all of whom played a role in dragging medicine into the 20th century via the scientific method.Then, we have a mighty record scratch and Barry decides to spend about 200 pages on the 1918 epidemic itself. The majority of individuals introduced in the first section of the book take a backseat to an almost mind-numbing number of U.S. military cantonments, local and national politicians, and morbidity and mortality statistics. The level of detail is overwhelming and largely made my eyes glaze over. Frustratingly, this part of the book felt almost entirely disconnected from the medical history discussed earlier. Due to the severity of the pandemic, the carefully laboratory work according to the scientific method had to be discarded for shortcuts and best guesses. I figured Barry would highlight this irony and while he mentioned it a time or two, he for the most part just kept barreling forward through the history.Record scratch number two. With the end of the pandemic, we return to a smaller subset of the cast of characters discussed prior to its arrival and follow their lives and research down a number of paths that are only tangentially related (if at all) to influenza. Many of the most important individuals from the first part of the book are discarded without providing any sort of conclusion to their story.The whole thing was immensely aggravating. Whenever I look at a marble sculptures in art museums, I marvel at the fact that a sculptor was able to look at a block of stone, see the figure within, and get rid of the extra to reveal what was there all along. The Great Influenza felt like John M. Barry looking at a block of marble, seeing David, sculpting away, and instead revealing a figure with six arms, two heads, and feet erupting Alien-like from its chest. There are probably two and a half good books contained within, but Barry couldn't see what to get rid of and editor Wendy Wolf certainly didn't take a firm enough hand. I'm genuinely alarmed at the thought of what this book looked like pre-editor after reading the bloated and muddled final result. Here's the kicker: in the acknowledgements, John Barry pulls back the curtain on the process of writing the book and fully reveals his obliviousness. Get a load of this:""This book was initially supposed to be a straightforward story of the deadliest epidemic in human history, told from the perspectives of both scientists who tried to fight it and political leaders who tried to respond to it. I though it would take me two and a half years to write, three at the most. That plan didn't work. Instead this book took seven years to write. It has evolved (and, I hope, grown) into something rather different than originally conceived.""NO JOHN, THE NEW PLAN PLAN DIDN'T WORK. YOU SHOULD HAVE STUCK WITH THE ORIGINAL. Seven years. Holy crud.Other nits to pick: I often felt like Barry had an agenda to push. At various times in the book, he would stake out rather extreme positions and seemed to only approach the history from that angle, with Wilson's approach to World War I and the U.S. military's approach to the pandemic being two of the major examples. Were either perfect? Certainly not, but Barry seemed almost to cast them as the villains of the influenza pandemic, a practice I found unhelpful. I was also distinctly uncomfortable with an insinuation Barry made about the death of Paul A. Lewis. Implying suicide shouldn't be thrown around without evidence, and Barry provided nothing concrete. Not cool, dude.The writing is also nothing to write home about. Barry has an annoying habit of repeating anecdotes throughout the book and if I see the sentence ""It was influenza, only influenza"" one more time, I might scream.It's probably 1.5 stars but I'm rounding up. So why two instead of one? I did learn some things and a number of individual threads in the book were interesting. Highlights include a better understanding of why Johns Hopkins has the reputation it does, what the Hs and Ns are in influenza (ex: the H1N1 strain), and the word enzootic*.In all honesty, though, I'd probably pass on this one. You can learn the bulk of the 1918 influenza-specific stuff more quickly and enjoyably via Wikipedia. *It is to animals what the word ""epidemic"" is to humans, which makes sense given the roots. I'm distinctly less excited about it now, though, having just looked up the pronunciation and realized that it is pronounced en-zoh-AH-tic instead of en-ZOO-tic. I suppose you can't win them all."
282,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3244513-mike,4,"Overall this was a very good book. Expansive, thorough, and at times utterly fascinating. I'm sure people around me are completely sick of me talking about the flu at this point but this is that kind of book that will do that to you. It falls short of getting five stars for a couple of reasons, some of which are about the book but most of which are about me as a reader:1. It's almost too expansive: In Barry's quest to explore every possible nook and cranny of the 1918 Influenza pandemic he leaves no scientific idea or historical actor unearthed and thoroughly discussed. This lends to a skater shot feel to the book as you lurch from one person to another in chronological order with whole chapters about the science of viruses and bacteria popping up here and there to interrupt the forward momentum of the story. I feel like I got a about a dozen very short, somewhat shallow, biographies in this one book and a bit more science that I really wanted. 2. Lack of a supporting personal story or strong main character: When I contrast this book with Steven Johnson's ""Ghost Map"", which is all about John Snow and how he dealt with a cholera outbreak in London in the 19th Century, I find that it didn't hold my attention all the time because I didn't really connect with any of the people in the book or feel like there was a broad narrative that was pulling me along. Sure, he does a good job of showing how the pandemic began, how it peaks, and how it ebbs but the pandemic is far too amorphous for me to really relate to. And while he clearly shows how many of the people in the book react at these different phases I didn't really feel like I got to know any of them with the kind of detail that Johnson pulled out of John Snow.3. Hey, you got your science book in my history book! No, you got your history book in my science book! Wow, they're two great genres that kind of make for a confusing mess when you put them all together: Okay, this gripe is all about me as a reader. I'm WAY more interested in history and politics than science. Unless the science is about robots, zombies, or space ships at a certain point I kind of just zone out. Barry, at times, gets super deep on the science of influenza explaining in great detail how it infects the body and causes no end of problems. While it is a great feat of writing to talk about that sort of thing without losing the reader (to his credit it was never confusing) it doesn't make for a compelling read for me. When Barry talks about history in this book it's completely riveting, I literally couldn't put it down, but then there would be a speed bump science chapter and I'd have to slog through it to get back to the ideas that were the most interesting to me. It made for a frustrating read at times.Over all I would highly recommend this book. It really was quite good, my gripes aside. And, frankly, the historical implications of the book make it worth the read alone (namely that at a crucial junction in the negotiation of the Treaty of Versailles at the end of World War I Pres. Wilson came down with the flu and it, for a bunch of reasons, left him possibly permanently mentally impaired - he believed from that point on that French spies had infiltrated the White House for example - is shocking. Given that that treaty is often held directly responsible for the rise of Nazi Germany, and World War II, and that the principle features of that treaty may have caused the rise of the Nazi's were almost all pushed by the French and opposed by Pres. Wison, until his bought with the flu that is, one is left believing if not for the flu the world could have been very different). If you like science and enjoy history I think this would be a very satisfying reading experience.As an aside, I gave this book to my Grandmother for Christmas in 2009 when she was 91 years old. She and I developed a pattern late in her life of me giving her books that I'd read that I liked for birthdays and Christmas. She was an avid reader and game to read anything, although like me her preferences were more inclined to history, biography, and travel. This was one of the rare books I gave her without reading first. When I asked her, on Christmas 2011, to lend me one of her favorite books she gave me this one. She was born in April of 1918, near the beginning of this book, and I think for her the book explained a lot of things people would mention in her childhood that never made much sense (relatives who died during the flu, particular idioms people would use, or beliefs they had about sickness). She died in March of 2012 just a month shy of 94. In reading this book I am profoundly impressed by her intelligence. This book is not an easy read in spots (there were sections I read twice) and for someone who didn't even finish high school to read this book and not only understand it but enjoy it is a testament to the amazing person she was. This book still has the post-it note she always put on the inside front cover of books she got as gifts with the date, occasion, and person(s) who gave it to her. While she may be gone it makes me happy that she and I could at least share this one last experience together. "

285,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/611813-melinda,4,"Re-reading again in 2020 in the middle of the coronavirus outbreak.This is an excellent book. Reading it in the time of Coronavirus is eye-opening. I wish that the shrill shrieking gerbils of the media would provide comparisons ""per population"" for their numbers, and also comparisons with the traditional flu. The 2nd half of the book is especially worthwhile in this time of pandemic.********I highly recommend this book! It reads like a ""who-done-it"", except that you know who did it (the influenza virus) and you are watching the medical scientists struggle to find solutions while the wild-fire of the 1918 influenza pandemic raged all around them. Will they find a solution in time? (see the bottom paragraph for an answer to this question)Before documenting the path of the 1918 influenza, the author lays the groundwork for the transformed medical atmosphere from the late 1800's into the early 1900's in America. This path thus shows the beginnings of the the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research, the Phipps Institute, and Johns Hopkins University. Names of medical pioneers and influenza warriors such as Paul Lewis (who proved that polio was caused by a virus in 1907 and developed a vaccine that was 100% effective in protecting monkeys), William Henry Welch (the single most powerful individual in the history of American medicine, who directed the rise of Johns Hopkins University, and who with John D. Rockefeller Jr. created the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research, arguablly the best scientific research institute in the world), Simon Flexner (first head of the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research, the man who brought the mortality rate for common bacterial meningitis down to 18% in 1919 WITHOUT antibiotics!), Rufus Cole (who made the Rockefeller Institute Hospital a model for the way clinical research is conducted), Army Surgeon General William Gorgas (whose work in abating the transmission of yellow fever and malaria by controlling the mosquitos saved hundreds of thousands of lives, and allowed construction on the Panama Canal), Oswald Avery (whose work on influenza would lead him to one of the most important scientific discoveries in the 20th century, that DNA is the material of which genes and chromosomes are made), Anna Wessel Williams (the leading female bacteriologist in the world who worked hand in hand with William Park trying to develop a serum or vaccine for influenza),William Park (teamed with Anna Wessel Williams, developed the diptheria antitoxin still in use today), andRichard Shope (who as the first to prove that a virus caused influenza) fill the pages of this book. After setting the stage with its influenza warriors and medical laboratories, the author then begins the saga of the influenza virus itself. Influenza struck in the first wave in the winter and spring of 1918, a mild ""three day fever"" form that most recovered from. The second wave hit in the fall of 1918. This wave was the most virulent and deadly. The third wave hit somewhere in the winter / spring of 1919, and was once again a less virulent form. In just 2 years the virus mutated into a super killer, then back into a more mild disease. In raw numbers, the lowest estimate of the worldwide death toll at the time was 20 million. Knowing what we know now, epidemiologists today estimate that influenza caused at least 50 million and possibly 100 million deaths worldwide. All that in a time when the population of the world was 1/3rd of what it is today. The terrifying aspect of the super killer influenza was that it did not strike the traditional victims... the old and the very young, but instead hit hardest in the age group of 20's and 30's. If the upper estimate of 100 million deaths is accurate, then 8 to 10 percent of all young adults then living were killed by the virus.And these deaths happened with blinding speed. The influenza pandemic stretched out over 2 years. But 2/3rds of the deaths occurred in a period of 24 weeks. That is about 66 million deaths in 24 weeks. Averaged out that would be 2.5 million deaths per week. Yet more than half of those 66 million deaths happened from mid-September to early December of 1918. That is really 33 million deaths in 10 to 12 weeks! That's 3.3 MILLION deaths PER WEEK in the late fall and early winter of 1918! And remember that the world population at the time was less than 1/3rd of what it is today (which is 6.8 billion people). The numbers are just staggering, and I had to keep reading them and figuring out the numbers and it still is a staggering thought. So many died in so short a time! Epidemiological evidence from the work of Dr. Loring Miner seems to show that the new influenza virus originated in Haskell County, Kansas early in the winter of 1918. Dr. Miner documented early cases of the new influenza that showed disturbing mortality rates in a very short period of time. The virus then went to a huge army base in the eastern part of the state as troops were gathered in preparation for their deployment to Europe for WWI. From that army base, soliders were sent to France, soldiers were transferred to other bases in the United States....and the disease began sweeping through North America, Europe, South America, Asia, Africa, and the entire world. Some situations requiring fast decision making in chaotic circumstances were carried out well. Other situations were not handled as well. The ins and outs of these crossing paths of decisions, deaths mounting rapidly, politics, mililtary directives, and newly formed medical laboratories make up the rest of the book. The story is staggering, but gripping. In answer to the question at the beginning of this review, the answer is ""no, the medical scientists did not find a solution during the time of the 1918 thru 1920 influenza pandemic"". They learned alot, yes. They also learned that the only way to be protected from the disease was through isolation from it. Medical practices helping and treating the ill were improved, but a vaccine was never been found. The only reason the killing influenza stopped killing was because it mutated away from the more virulent form into a milder form. So the question immediately to ask is ""what happens if the virus mutates back to the virulent form?"". And that is the question we are left with at the end of the book. In the concluding chapter, the author raises these issues and concludes tentatively that in pandemic times, an authorized power (government, World Health Organization, army, someone) must have the authority to act and to act quickly, and their decisions must trump individual freedoms. Mandatory vaccinations, mandatory quaranatine, mandatory travel restrictions are the things that must be done to protect the larger population. The ""needs of the many outweigh the needs of the one"", if I may quote a Star Trek movie. In times of such overwhelming medical need, quick decisions must be made and sometimes they must be harsh."

In the present there is a virulent influenza outbreak and in the past there is the plague sweeping through England.

287,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4118002-jeanne,4,"The Great Influenza is a sobering story, especially in today’s climate. This well-researched book gives a detailed account of why this deadly pandemic devastated the world. A well-written history."
288,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10978428-jim,4,"The bodies were piling up. The undertakers, themselves falling sick, were overwhelmed. There was no place to put the bodies. Gravediggers were either sick or refused to bury the influenza victims. Caskets were stacking up...then they ran short of caskets. The city morgue filled up. The stench was terrible...this was Philadelphia, October 1918, the time of the so-called ""Spanish flu."" Barry gives us a panoramic view of the most lethal influenza outbreak in history which occurred in 1918-1919. Today we believe that the death toll in the United States was 675,000 out of a population of 105 million. As many as 100 million died worldwide out of a global population of 1.8 billion, more than 5% of the world's population.  Barry follows the movement of the flu virus across the world, starting in rural Kansas, where somehow the virus crossed the animal-human barrier (from chickens?). It erupted in an Army camp in Kansas and moved east with the soldiers and then went on the troopships with them to Europe...It came in three waves, that first wave that hit the soldiers in the spring of 1918 was rather mild. But then in the fall, there was the second wave that was much more virulent--that's when most of the deaths occurred. Then the virus mutated again and there was a third wave which hit places like Australia--which had not been hit so hard by the second wave. Much of the book is involved with the story of the scientists battling the virus. Barry goes into some detail about this and focuses on some key figures. As he explains, a revolution had occurred in American medicine where labs had been organized and work was going on with the expectation that disease could be conquered by modern science. When it came to the great influenza, science failed. We are still living with the consequences of that.  The book was published in 2004 and, in it, Barry warns that we will face another pandemic. It's only a question of when. He states that we are NOT prepared for a pandemic. The events of this year of 2020 shows that he was right."
289,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6949571-thomas-paul,5,"It killed more people in 6 months than the Black Death killed in a century. People who were young and strong were the most likely to die. In the US, 650,000 people died. The average life expectancy in the US went down by 10 years. Worldwide, perhaps 100 million people died. And yet, it was only the flu. Even today, 90 years after the epidemic, it kills 36,000 Americans in a typical year and we are hardly more prepared to face another epidemic.John M. Barry has written a fascinating account of the influenza epidemic of 1918. But the book is a lot more than just a review of the flu. Barry starts out by examining the state of the American health system at the time of the epidemic and how it reached that state. He explores the revolutionary changes to medicine that occurred in the late 19th and early 20th century and the people who led those changes. He shows us why, even today, a cure for influenza is beyond our reach, explaining in layman’s terms how the influenza virus changes to become deadly and changes again to lose that deadliness. He explains how an endemic virus can lead to an epidemic of unimagined proportions.Barry also shows how the demands of World War I on troop movements, the propaganda campaigns to keep morale high, and the failure of leaders to listen to the doctors and researchers led to a killing field of historic size. His account tends to concentrate on Philadelphia because the city was hit extremely hard and much of the research going on was near that city but he does cover other areas around the world hit hard by the virus, although his coverage of the flu outside of the US is sketchy at best. He gives us writings from diaries and newspaper articles to show what was actually happening and how the media tried to downplay the epidemic. He gives us detailed accounts of the research (and the researchers) that was done to fight the epidemic, explains why this research was mostly unsuccessful, and does it all in a way that is easy to understand even if you don’t have a medical degree.Barry likes to use foreshadowing, hints of what is to come, to keep the reader’s interest and it does work, even if it is a bit melodramatic. Even the chapter titles, “The Tinderbox”, “It Begins”, The Race”, provide some melodrama to the story. The book mostly moves at a good pace and I found myself having trouble putting it down. Barry has written a book that everyone should read, whether you are familiar with the epidemic or not. It is a fascinating, terrifying, detailed, and extremely important book."
290,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8298053-colleen-browne,3,"This book starts out with a summary of medicine from Hippocrates to the First World War. That seems like it would be a long slog but because there was so little advancement during that time, it is done fairly quickly. As a reader with very limited knowledge of the history of medicine, I found this very interesting. What I didn't know at the beginning of the book was that the better part of the book was spent with the author going off on tangents only peripherally related to the pandemic. There is a great deal of information in this book, too much information. This book could have done with a good editor. The length of the book was about the same length as most of the books I read, and in many cases, much shorter but it didn't feel that way. It felt much longer. Barry's use of metaphor was helpful in explaining his subject and his style of writing wasn't awful as many reviewers have charged but he didn't seem to know when to stop on those threads that he followed out to what felt like oblivion at times. This is the first book I have read devoted to the subject (and may be the last). I could not recommend this book; at least not to anyone just interested in the pandemic. I can only suppose that there are better books on the topic."

293,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68316850-gavin,3,"Rousing history of one of the worst things that has ever happened: the 1918 outbreak of H1N1 flu. It focusses particularly on the great scientists who tried to fight it, none of whom I'd ever heard of. Also a meditation on epistemology, the modern mind, & the redemptive meaning of science for beasts like us.Barry senses that the headline result - one-third of the entire world infected, with 
25-100
 million dead - doesn't get enough of a rise from us. The numbers are numbing. So he couches it in modern shocking terms:
 It killed more people in twenty-four weeks than AIDS has killed in twenty-four years, more in a year than the Black Death killed in a century.
Or ten thousand 9/11s. It's worth belabouring this, because we have a weird habit of paying far more attention to human threats than natural ones, even when natural ones are far worse. (Witness our terrorism prevention budgets compared to our infectious disease control budgets, when the latter is a thousand times more lethal.)So: The 1918 flu was worse than the entire First World War: 40+ million died of flu compared with 17 million dead from war; 500 million lives damaged by flu vs 41 million lives by war. 3% of everyone alive died of flu, including about 8% of young adults(!).Except it's hard to separate the War and the pandemic. The virus was spread everywhere by unprecedented numbers of troops, and by the massive supply convoys it induced, and by the War's other human displacements. We don't know how many of the pneumonia deaths only occurred because of the logistical degradation, poverty and pestilence of wartime. There are terrible nonlinearities involved in overcrowding and global movement of troops. But add millions at least to the overall death toll caused by WWI.The book is in the epic mode, all the way through. (That's not a straightforward compliment.) I liked it, but I understand if it's a bit American for you:
Man might be defined as “modern” largely to the extent that he attempts to control nature. In this relationship with nature, modern humanity has generally been the aggressor, and a daring one at that, altering the flow of rivers, building upon geological faults, and, today, even engineering the genes of existing species. Nature has generally been languid in its response, although contentious once aroused and occasionally displaying a flair for violence.By 1918 humankind was fully modern, and fully scientific, but too busy fighting itself to aggress against nature. Nature, however, chooses its own moments. It chose this moment to aggress against man, and it did not do so prodding languidly. For the first time, modern humanity, a humanity practicing the modern scientific method, would confront nature in its fullest rage.
There's a long prelude describing how terrible medicine was up to the 20th Century. Medicine was ""the withered arm of science"". Therapeutic nihilism (that is, ""we can't really do anything"") was the only rational view, replacing millenia of Galenic woo.
Stengel reviewed dozens of ideas advanced in medical journals. Gargles of various disinfectants. Drugs. Immune sera. Typhoid vaccine. Diphtheria antitoxin. But Stengel’s message was simple: This doesn’t work. That doesn’t work. Nothing worked... Nothing they were doing worked.
Problem is, this rational scepticism created a powerful vacuum: humans need to believe something can heal, and the gap was filled with worse. Some confabulated gremlins from this time haunt us still: homeopathy, chiropractic, naturopathy, Christian Science, and (though Barry doesn't include them) the organic farming movement and psychoanalysis.Few people come off well. Even among the scientists, we get a horrible example of perverse priors and premature updating: an enormous proportion of all scientific resources were devoted to fighting the wrong pathogen, due to a bad guess by an extremely eminent researcher.Because so much of the state was occupied in war, in places there was wholesale social collapse:
In Philadelphia meanwhile fear came and stayed. Death could come from anyone, anytime. People moved away from others on the sidewalk, avoided conversation; if they did speak, they turned their faces away to avoid the other person’s breathing. The impossibility of getting help compounded the isolation. 850 Philadelphia doctors and more nurses were away in the military. More than that number were sick. Philadelphia General Hospital had 126 nurses. Despite all precautions, despite wearing surgical masks and gowns, eight doctors and fifty-four nurses—43 percent of the staff—themselves required hospitalization. Ten nurses at this single hospital died. The Board of Health pleaded for help from retired nurses and doctors if they remembered “even a little” of their profession.When a nurse or doctor or policeman did actually come, they wore their ghostly surgical masks, and people fled them. In every home where someone was ill, people wondered if the person would die. And someone was ill in every home...Starr went to Emergency Hospital #2 at Eighteenth and Cherry Streets. He did have help, if it could be called that, from an elderly physician who had not practiced in years and who brought Starr into touch with the worst of heroic medicine. Starr wouldn’t forget that, the ancient arts of purging, of venesection, the ancient art of opening a patient’s vein. But for the most part he and the other students elsewhere were on their own, with little help even from nurses, who were so desperately needed that in each of ten emergency hospitals supplied by the Red Cross only a single qualified nurse was available to oversee whatever women came as volunteers. And often the volunteers reported for their duty once and, from either fear or exhaustion, did not come again.Nearly 1/4 of all the patients in his hospital died each day. Starr would go home, and when he returned the next day, he would find that between one-quarter and one-fifth of the patients in the hospital had died, replaced by new ones... Virtually all of them, along with their friends and relatives, were terrified that, no matter how mild the symptoms seemed at first, within them moved an alien force, a seething, spreading infection, a live thing with a will that was taking over their bodies — and could be killing them...The city was frozen with fear, frozen into stillness. Starr lived 12 miles from the hospital. The streets were silent on his drive home, silent. They were so silent he took to counting the cars he saw. One night he saw no cars at all. He thought, “The life of the city had almost stopped.”
Everyone can read the collapse of official power in Philadelphia as supporting their politics. Anarchists can point to the benevolent spontaneous order that arose after the corrupt local government failed to act; libertarians can point out that this spontaneous order was all funded by the richest Philadelphians; statists can point out that, without actually-authoritative co-ordination, the effort eventually failed, because people defected against each other, in fear.
The corpses had backed up at undertakers’, filling every area of these establishments and pressing up into living quarters; in hospital morgues overflowing into corridors; in the city morgue overflowing into the street. And they had backed up in homes. They lay on porches, in closets, in corners of the floor, on beds. Children would sneak away from adults to stare at them, to touch them; a wife would lie next to a dead husband, unwilling to move him or leave him. The corpses, reminders of death and bringers of terror or grief, lay under ice at Indian-summer temperatures. Their presence was constant, a horror demoralizing the city; a horror that could not be escaped. Finally the city tried to catch up to them.The police wore their ghostly surgical masks, and people fled them, but the masks had no effect on the viruses and by mid-October thirty-three policemen had died, with many more to follow... More coffins came by rail, guarded by men with guns.
""There is, therefore, but one response possible from us: Force! force to the utmost, force without stint or limit, the righteous and triumphant force which shall make right the law of the world and cast every selfish dominion down in the dust. ""- Woodrow Wilson addressing one of his money-lending mobs.Wilson tends to be viewed pretty positively, just because he won. (""at last the world knows America as the savior of the world!"") But he perverted an entire state and nation to do so, ignored the terrible suffering of his own damn population for years, and refused a conditional peace with Austria in August and with the Kaiser's new parliament in September. (This meant 30-70 extra days of war, which, if this period was as lethal as the rest of the war, means up to 800,000 completely unnecessary deaths, not to mention the continuing waste of resources during the worst epidemic ever). Wilson did great evil, was not much different from the Kaiser, the election aside.
 the military suctioned more and more nurses and physicians into cantonments, aboard ships, into France, until it had extracted nearly all the best young physicians. Medical care for civilians deteriorated rapidly. The doctors who remained in civilian life were largely either incompetent young ones or those over forty-five years of age, the vast majority of whom had been trained in the old ways of medicine. 
Barry's middle chapters are a frightening portrait of how rabidly un-American the US was in 1918. The laws were bad enough - for instance the ban on criticising the government. But then there's the unofficial ""patriotic duties"", punishable by beatings. State-sponsored atavism.
By the summer of 1918, however, Wilson had injected the government into every facet of national life and had created great bureaucratic engines to focus all the nation’s attention and intent on the war.He had created a Food Administration to control and distribute food, a Fuel Administration to ration coal and gasoline, a War Industries Board to oversee the entire economy. He had taken all but physical control over the railroads and had created a federally sponsored river barge line that brought commerce back to life on the Mississippi River, a commerce that had been killed by competition from those railroads. He had built many dozens of military installations, each of which held at least tens of thousands of soldiers or sailors. He had created industries that made America’s shipyards teem with hundreds of thousands of laborers launching hundreds of ships, dug new coal mines to produce coal for the factories that weaned America’s military from British and French weapons and munitions—for, unlike in World War II, America was no arsenal of democracy.He had created a vast propaganda machine, an internal spy network, a bond-selling apparatus... He had even succeeded in stifling speech, in the summer of 1918 arresting and imprisoning — some for prison terms longer than ten years —not just radical labor leaders and editors of German-language newspapers but powerful men, even a congressman.He had injected the government into American life in ways unlike any other in the nation’s history. And the final extension of federal power had come only in the spring of 1918, after the first wave of influenza had begun jumping from camp to camp, when the government expanded the draft from males between the ages of twenty-one and thirty to those between the ages of eighteen and forty-five. Only on May 23, 1918, had Provost Marshal Enoch Crowder, who oversaw the draft, issued his “work or fight” order, stating that anyone not employed in an essential industry would be drafted...Crowder bragged about doing “in a day what the Prussian autocracy had been spending nearly fifty years to perfect...""In mid-August, as the lethal wave of the epidemic was gathering itself, Austria had already inquired about peace terms, an inquiry that Wilson rebuffed utterly. And as the epidemic was gathering full momentum, peace was only weeks away. Bulgaria had signed an armistice on September 29. On September 30, Kaiser Wilhelm had granted parliamentary government to the German nation; that same day Ludendorff had warned his government that Germany must extend peace feelers or disaster—immediate disaster—would follow. German diplomats sent out those feelers. Wilson ignored them. The Central Powers, Germany and her allies, were simultaneously breaking off one from one another and disintegrating internally as well. In the first week of October, Austria and Germany separately sent peace feelers to the Allies, and on October 7, Austria delivered a diplomatic note to Wilson formally seeking peace on any terms Wilson chose. Ten days later — days of battle and deaths — the Austrian note remained unanswered.Earlier Wilson had spoken of a “peace without victory,” believing only such a peace could last. But now he gave no indication that the war would soon be over. Although a rumor that the war had ended sent thrills through the nation, Wilson quickly renounced it. Nor would he relent. He was not now fighting to the death; he was fighting only to kill...If Wilson and his government would not be turned from his end even by the prospect of peace, they would hardly be turned by a virus. And the reluctance, inability, or outright refusal of the American government to shift targets would contribute to the killing. Wilson took no public note of the disease, and the thrust of the government was not diverted. The relief effort for influenza victims would find no assistance in the Food Administration or the Fuel Administration or the Railroad Administration. From neither the White House nor any other senior administration post would there come any leadership, any attempt to set priorities, any attempt to coordinate activities, any attempt to deliver resources....the military would give no help to civilians. Instead it would draw further upon civilian resources. The same day that Welch had stepped out of the autopsy room at Devens and called Gorgas’s office, his warning had been relayed to the army chief of staff, urging that all transfers be frozen unless absolutely necessary and that under no circumstances transfers from infected camps be made... Gorgas’s superiors ignored the warning. There was no interruption of movement between camps whatsoever; not until weeks later, with the camps paralyzed and, literally, tens of thousands of soldiers dead or dying, did the army make any adjustments.
Because the disease was everywhere, ravaging the entire species (and beyond), the book can't cover everything. Very little is said about non-Americans, i.e about 98% of the death and chaos. This is partly because there just isn't a lot of evidence about them, despite their influenza immunity and medical care being even worse. (This is why the top estimates reach 100m deaths, three times the median estimate.) Here is a passage about just a tiny number of them, in the north:
In Alaska, whites protected themselves. Sentries guarded all trails, and every person entering the city was quarantined for five days. Eskimos had no such luck. A senior Red Cross official warned that without “immediate medical assistance the race” could become “extinct.”...The navy provided the collier USS Brutus to carry a relief expedition... They found terrible things. One doctor visited ten tiny villages and found “three wiped out entirely; others average 85% deaths… Survivors generally children… probably 25% frozen to death before help arrived.”The virus probably did not kill all of them directly. But it struck so suddenly it left no one well enough to care for any others, no one to get food, no one to get water. And those who could have survived, surrounded by bodies, bodies of people they loved, might well have preferred to go where their family had gone, might well have wanted to no longer be alone... Two hundred sixty-six people had lived in Okak, and many dogs, dogs nearly wild. When the virus came, it struck so hard so fast people could not care for themselves or feed the dogs. The dogs grew hungry, crazed with hunger, devoured each other, then wildly smashed through windows and doors, and fed... In all of Labrador, at least one-third the total population died. 
---Barry commits at least one big error: he's horrified by the medical schools of the time having ""no standards for admission"":
 In research and education especially, American medicine lagged far behind [European medicine]... At least one hundred US medical schools would accept any man willing to pay tuition... and only a single medical school required its student to have a college degree... the Johns Hopkins itself, not student fees, paid [its] faculty salaries, and it required medical students to have not only a college degree but fluency in French and German and a background of science courses. 
But his enthusiasm for Johns Hopkins introducing the college degree requirement is misplaced. Contemporary US doctors (who all have 3 years of pre-med, or even more college, before they start medical training) are probably no better clinicians than undergraduate doctors in other countries, and are far further in debt. This requirement is probably one reason the American system is so fucked.I suppose Barry is just confusing the open admissions situation with the schools' appallingly low graduation standards, which is certainly one reason eC20th medicine sucked. (Many doctors had never looked down a microscope, never used a stethoscope on a patient, never seen a dissection.)---PS: Mostly unimportant corrections by a virologist here. Reply to these from Barry here."
294,0143036491,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22063432-tom-mathews,5,"The old adage that 'those who fail to learn from the past are condemned to repeat it' has never been so true. President George W. Bush read this book shortly after it was published and was so impressed by the threat of future pandemics that he commissioned a department whose sole function was to prepare for future pandemics. This involved cooperation by federal, state and international entities (such as the WHO) to set up surveillance networks for potentially deadly diseases and to stockpile drugs and equipment such as mechanical ventilators that could be used in the event of a sharp spike in the number of inpatient hospitalizations. Unfortunately, the current president quickly defunded and essentially disbanded all of President Bush's efforts to prepare for what scientists and even foresighted politicians knew was inevitable. In his book, Barry wrote of the things that people did to protect themselves in 1918-19 and recommendations for what we could do when the next pandemic occurred. There was actually very few differences between the two lists: masks, hand-washing, social distancing and the cancelling of large gatherings being prominent on both lists. Barry asserted that our greatest chance of preventing a full-scale calamity lay in forethought and preparation. We will never know if that would have had much of an impact. When Barry wrote this book he likely couldn't have foreseen the political situation the U.S. finds itself in today but he knew politicians. He knew that in order to avoid boosting the enemy's morale in wartime, our leaders refused to speak honestly about the seriousness of the influenza pandemic and, as a result, millions died. But if he thought that politicians today were any better, he likely wouldn't have written in the afterward of one edition ""On a larger scale, and far more difficult, will be getting governments to tell the truth about the disease. This is perhaps the biggest lesson about 1918 and it is a lesson not yet learned.""I try to avoid revealing spoilers in my reviews but these are unusual times and I think that the best way to close this review is to let Barry do it for me. Here are the closing paragraphs in this magnificent work:
So the final lesson of 1918, a simple one yet one most difficult to execute, is that those who occupy positions of authority must lessen the panic that can alienate all within a society. Society cannot function if it is every man for himself. By definition, civilization cannot survive that. Those in authority must retain the public’s trust. The way to do that is to distort nothing, to put the best face on nothing, to try to manipulate no one. Lincoln said that first, and best. A leader must make whatever horror exists concrete. Only then will people be able to break it apart.

As tempting as it is to adapt a nihilistic, blaming stance about the current pandemic. I think it far better to [a] educate ourselves, and [b] vote for a rational, evidence based public-health policy that learns from the past and adopts to meet the challenges of the situation at hand.Let’s let the sciences and the humanities do their job of understanding and informing us of what went wrong before, so we can get it right(er) this time.Viruses are scary and secretive little boogers. But their not a complete mystery. And the misery they cause is (at this point in human history) manageable and even preventable with a little research, oversight, cooperation and leadership.There probably isn’t a lot of profit to be made. Vaccines are not typically big money makers. So don’t hold your breath waiting for the invisible hand of the free market to save us on this issue.TechBros will not disrupt this situation. There ain’t no app for this and there never will be. And the old model of nation states enmeshed in competitive zero-sum power struggles is also a fail. But a little public health funding, and some global scale cooperation and were suddenly looking SOOO much much better than we currently do.That’s not saying much, but it’s a nice start.If an ounce of prevention equals a pound of cure. Let’s pound the shit out of the next global pandemic. I’m quite certain none of us would like to experience this nightmare again. Five stars ⭐️ no SARS 😷"

The 1918 flu epidemic erupted during a war that had already killed tens of millions and at a time when medical science was far less accomplished than it is today. Although there are lessons to learn for our response to COVID-19, it’s important to view what happened then in its historical context. And that’s the approach John M. Barry so brilliantly takes in The Great Influenza. This engrossing book may well be one of the very best ever written on medical history.The historical context of the 1918 flu epidemicAs Barry makes clear, medical science had taken big steps forward in the decades before the pandemic erupted, especially in the United States. Half a century earlier, German researchers, and French to a lesser extent, led the world in medical research. However, by the outbreak of World War I, two institutions had spearheaded immense advances in American medicine: Johns Hopkins Hospital and the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research (later Rockefeller University).Johns Hopkins Hospital, founded in 1889, had been established expressly to bring the scientific method into the teaching and practice of medicine in the United States. The Rockefeller Institute set out from day one to become the world’s most important medical research institution, and many observers have expressed the opinion that it succeeded very shortly after its establishment in 1901. Barry traces the evolution of both Johns Hopkins and the Rockefeller (as they were then known) through in-depth sketches of the prominent physicians who led them. Those doctors, the heroes of the tale, played leadership roles in combating the 1918 flu epidemic, advising the military and government at all levels on precautionary measures and researching the origins of the disease and possible treatment. Unfortunately, they made little headway in either respect.Why the disease spread so widely and so quicklyThe doctors’ increasingly strident insistence on warning the public about the epidemic were met with rigid resistance until hundreds of thousands of Americans had already died. The Wilson administration had instituted draconian measures to prevent any news from reaching the public that would turn its attention from the need to support the war effort. Although press censorship was not in force, the nation’s press almost uniformly self-censored, parroting the official line that the disease was not serious while bodies piled up in the morgues. The result then, as it is today in the COVID-19 pandemic, was that those who denied the problem lost the public’s trust. But the biggest reason the influenza spread so widely and so quickly was the insistence of the US Army on transferring troops in large numbers from one base to another in crowded trains and then overseas in crowded ships.The 1918 flu epidemic was “the deadliest pandemic in history”Although up to five percent of the world’s population—and “as many as 8 to 10 percent of all young adults then living—died from the so-called “Spanish influenza,” its impact was not limited to the appalling death toll. Naturally, the pandemic greatly influenced the course of medical research and the adoption of public health measures far more widely than had been the case. But its consequences were far-reaching both in the conduct of World War I and in the shape of the peace that emerged from the conflict. Barry skillfully explores both themes in The Great Influenza.How the epidemic helped defeat GermanyIn April 1918, German commander Erich Ludendorff began “his last great offensive—Germany’s last real chance to win the war. The . . . offensive made great initial gains.” But then it stalled. Barry quotes the diary of a US Army surgeon stationed near the front: “‘The expected third phase of the great German offensive gets put off from day to day . . . I gather that the epidemic of grippe which hit us rather hard in Flanders also hit the Boche worse, and this may have caused the delay.'” In fact, Ludendorff himself “blamed influenza for the loss of initiative and the ultimate failure of the offensive.” No single battle necessarily changes the course of any war (although Midway, Stalingrad, and the Normandy Invasion are all claimed to have done just that in the next war.) But contemporary observers in 1918, and military analysts now, seem to agree that however slim the likelihood that Germany might end up victorious was certainly then lost.How the 1918 flu epidemic helped cause World War IIHistorians agree that the Treaty of Versailles that brought World War I to a close was a disaster. The excessive pain it imposed on Germany is almost universally acknowledged to have led in virtually a straight line to the Second World War. Yet that treaty took the form it did only because, midway through the peace conference, the world’s most popular statesman, Woodrow Wilson, suddenly and unaccountably “abandoned principles he had previously insisted upon. He yielded to [French Prime Minister Georges] Clemenceau everything of significance Clemenceau wanted, virtually all of which Wilson had earlier opposed.” Clemenceau was the primary architect of the harsh provisions incorporated into the treaty.Most accounts of Wilson’s strange turnabout at Versailles ascribe it to a minor stroke he suffered. The President was, in fact, in his sickbed when he made the fateful decision. However, Barry cites powerful evidence that Wilson had not in fact suffered a stroke. He had the flu. “Wilson’s actual symptoms—including high fever, severe coughing, and total prostration, [were] all symptoms that perfectly fit influenza and have no association whatsoever with stroke . . . Indeed, the virus may have contributed to the [severe] stroke” Wilson suffered much later that incapacitated him and led to his death.Where the “Spanish flu” really originatedWithin months of its appearance in the United States, the 1918 flu epidemic quickly went pandemic throughout Western Europe. The “Great War” was in its final months at the time, and rigid press censorship was in force on both sides of the trenches. Thus, even though thousands of American, French, British, and German troops were falling ill throughout the war zone, no news about their plight reached the home front in any one of the combatant countries. Neutral Spain, however, was different. There, alarmist reports about the virulence of the fast-spreading disease were splashed all over front pages. And that was how the epidemic came to be dubbed the “Spanish flu.”In fact, as Barry reports in detail, the deadly strain of H1N1 influenza at the heart of the 1918 flu epidemic almost certainly originated in Haskell County, Kansas, early that year. From there, the disease made its way eastward to a huge army “cantonment” where tens of thousands of troops were preparing to be shipped to France as cannon fodder for “Black Jack” Pershing‘s push against the German lines. Tens of thousands never made it there, falling victim instead to the flu. And, in carrying the disease to Europe, they triggered its spread to both Allied and enemy troops as well as civilian populations throughout Western Europe and ultimately to the rest of the world.How the 1918 flu epidemic was different from COVID-19In two major respects, the pandemic of a century ago differed significantly from what we are experiencing as I write:** Influenza is a respiratory disease that primarily attacks the lungs, nose, and throat. When it kills, it does so primarily through pneumonia. Although COVID-19 was initially feared to be similar in its effects, it is in truth a vascular disease that manifests through the circulatory system. ** It’s difficult for scientists to calculate the mortality (death) rate of a disease. But it is clear that the H1N1 influenza virus that emerged in 1918 was far more lethal than the COVID-19 strains that have been seen to date. Hundreds of thousands are dying today. Eventually, it seems likely that globally millions will do so. But it seems highly unlikely that the death toll will rise into the tens of millions as was the case a century ago.However, there is one significant way in which the two pandemics are similar. History tends to refer to the earlier pandemic as the “1918 flu epidemic,” suggesting that a first, relatively mild strain broke out in the spring of that year, followed by a second, far more lethal strain in the fall. In fact, though, the second wave lasted until 1919—and there was a third wave in 1920. Medical researchers tell us that COVID-19 is almost certain to behave in a similar fashion. As I write, we are experiencing either the first or the second wave of the disease (the experts differ). Yet another outbreak seems certain, with or without the speedy development of a vaccine—polyannish predictions to the contrary notwithstanding."

Outside of these few very well-known accounts, there is almost nothing in literature about it afterwards. They write about horrors that people inflict on people. Apparently they forget the horrors that nature inflicts on people, the horrors that make humans least significant. And yet the pandemic resonated.” Times like these only help us get perspective, Human race suffers from Amnesia and keeps forgetting the one and biggest truth of all. As Nietzsche's said - ""In some remote corner of the universe, poured out and glittering in innumerable solar systems, there once was a star on which clever animals invented knowledge. That was the highest and most mendacious minute of ""world history""—yet only a minute. After nature had drawn a few breaths the star grew cold, and the clever animals had to die."" We are nothing but a speck of dust in the grand scheme of things and times like these keep reminding us that. But times likes also explain why we are most thriving species on the earth today. We have invented these abstract concepts of ""Love"" , ""Compassion"" and ""Hope"" and that's what defines us. At the end this will be over I hope we are able to learn something out of this. This is an amazing read in my mind. The book not just telling the story of the pandemic but the foundations of the medical science in America. The author has done an amazing job covering different aspect of those times and I can certainly draw similarities in the current ongoing situations. It has definitely given me perspective. Help me interpret the media ( social/news) and conceive a bigger picture. "

The early history of the practice medicine in this country and lack of training of the doctors was jaw dropping. During WWI, academic instruction in general suffered due to total commitment to the war effort. ""In view of the comparatively short time during which most of the student-soldiers will remain in college and the exacting military duties awaiting them, academic instruction must necessarily be modified along the lines of direct military value.""I appreciated the great detail used in explaining the scientific rigor in trying to understand the disease that was plaguing the country and world. All the dead ends and false leads with persistent desperate scientists trying to find the answers in the midst of horror.""These things become easy to discern in hindsight. But how does one know when to persist, when to continue to try to make an experiment work, when to make adjustments - and when finally to abandon a line of thought as mistaken or incapable of solution with present techniques?How does one know when to do either?""With headlines starting to appear again about the danger from the Swine Flu which we might face in the fall, this book should be widely read and attention paid."

I keep seeing this book mentioned in the news (today: https://www.deseret.com/utah/2020/8/9...) so maybe I need to dust it off and give it another try. We'll see...2/28/18 REVIEW: Sigh, giving up on this book and marking it DNF. It's bloated and repetitive and verbose and wordy and ... umm, did I mention it's repetitive? I don't know if it's poorly-written or poorly-edited, but there were places were the same thing was said within pages of each other. And boring?!? Honestly, I was looking for a book about the flu to read during flu-season (especially in the year I decided NOT to get the flu shot), and all we get is lengthy biographies about the doctors and people who... well, I'm not even sure how most of them are important to the story. Really, when you pick up a book about a deadly disease you want to read about the deadly disease, and not wait for a couple hundred pages for it to appear or get good. The book is going back on the shelf but I guess I'll leave my bookmark where it is, just in case I get really bored."
