Yes, top-secret Cold War atomic spaceship designs that were scientifically sound but too far ahead of their time to ever see the light of day are totally sweet. However, I found to my chagrin that despite the promising premise, this book is strictly for hardcore math and science nerds, and is not to be touched by humanities and other garden-variety nerds such as yours truly. Anyone expecting an Arthur C. Clarke-ian level of scientific approachability will be sorely disappointed, as it's basically a 300-page litany of advanced physics and engineering principles being discussed in the abstract, Cold War-era US Air Force budgetary procurement procedures, and rosters of what physicists worked at which lab in what year. Oh, how I wanted to like this book... and oh, how I loathe abandoning any book unfinished... but this one was so unbearably dry that I had to slam it shut after only 100 pages. Gack.If you really know your math and sciences and think spaceships are cool, this is probably the book for you. But if you're like me and are just a regular old nerd who thinks spaceships are cool, you are S.O.L.Abort mission... abort mission..."
1,0805072845,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2665750-sarah,3,"The more I read about nuclear weapons and the culture surrounding them in the 1950s and 1960s, the more I feel it's a miracle that I'm here to read and write and think about them at all. Without even getting into Mutual Assured Destruction, here are some ideas for ridiculous uses of nuclear bombs other than (directly) using them as weapons which were recounted in this book:- melting oil out of the Alberta tar sands- digging a sea-level Panama Canal- mass-producing tritium to build even more nuclear bombs- lighting a cigarette (by using a parabolic mirror to focus energy from the fireball of a nuclear explosion 12 miles away)*- exploding a whole bunch in rapid succession as sort of a ""nyah-nyah, you can't tell us what to do"" gesture*- throwing them off the back of a spaceship and exploding them to provide propulsion(* = idea was actually carried out)The last, of course, is the center of the story. It's more than a little unsettling to read about the starry-eyed optimism of this group of physicists, and the way they threw themselves into drawing spring-and-damper diagrams to solve problems like designing shock absorbers for their 4,000-ton spacecraft while largely ignoring ""minor"" issues like fallout. (Freeman Dyson estimated that radiation would kill about 10 people for each Orion mission launched, but that the existing bomb tests in the 50s and 60s were probably killing about 1000 people per year. Even Orion crew members wouldn't have been safe - even if they had plenty of shielding on the back end of the spaceship between them and the bombs, nuclear explosions in atmosphere would cause the air to side-scatter radiation into the ship, which would also be engulfed by the fireballs produced. Minor details, minor details.)All that said, though, it is kind of interesting to wonder whether Orion might represent a viable method of protecting the Earth from a catastrophic collision with an asteroid or comet. Instead of using nuclear bombs to try and blow the thing up, you could just steer it off to a new course instead. And if you could use regular chemical rockets to launch the bombs and get them to intercept the target far enough from the Earth, you might avoid the worst of the side effects. There really aren't that many high-thrust, high-specific-impulse propulsion solutions out there. But I do think it would take the threat of planetwide apocalypse to make the idea reasonable.Man, humanity scares me sometimes."
2,0805072845,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7149595-dan-cowden,5,"From the late '50s to the mid '60s a group of scientists and engineers, never numbering more than 50, and spending barely $10 million over seven years, developed what remains the only efficient method of putting large cargoes into space or of sending large scale missions to explore other planets. Their method? Explode nuclear bombs a short distance from the spacecraft and ride the shockwave like a surfboard. The science & engineering behind it were never shot down, and in fact consistently cited as sound.The fact that it used nuclear explosions, however, meant that it was both highly classified and politically impractical to use.The author of this book, George Dyson, is the son of one of the group's founding minds, physicist Freeman Dyson, and some 40 years after his father left the project, George Dyson went about systematically reconstructing how the project began, developed, and died, conducting hundreds of interviews of the surviving scientists & engineers, as well as combing archives and journals for those details which have been declassified (with the amusing result that when NASA reopened studies on the concept in 1999, they asked the younger Dyson for nearly 1,800 pages of Project Orion reports which they could not find in Government vaults). Project Orion was founded by many of the scientists who were heavily involved in the nuclear arms race following WWII, the big brains at Los Alamos & Livermore who tried to create ever more powerful, efficient, and smaller nuclear warheads. Eventually, they wanted to use them for something other than destruction, and quickly realized that they would make an extremely efficient propulsion source for a spacecraft. A 4,000-ton Orion-style spacecraft was expected to place well over 1,000 tons of payload into Earth Orbit. These giants of science were no doubt naive in their idealism and optimism, but nevertheless managed to hit upon a vastly more efficient means of leaving Earth's gravity well than all the billions spent leading up to Apollo -- which they correctly prophesied would become a technological dead-end where space development was concerned. If ideas of sending a manned mission to Saturn in the mid-60s or even mid-70s seem far-fetched today, at the time many people were riding the post-WWII high when anything imaginable seemed possible...a state of mind which seems quite foreign to people today.This book is not terribly technical; no major math is required, and only a very basic understanding of science. It is much more about the power of a few bright individuals left to develop an idea in a nurturing environment and then about the unthinking power of a bureaucracy to stifle something for which it has no immediate use...even if there may be a use for it in the future."
3,0805072845,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3171124-chris,3,"There was a serious proposal, starting in 1945, for the US to build a gigantic nuclear-powered spaceship. Top scientists worked on the plan for secret in years, but it was eventually abandoned. This book is the story of that project, and what could have been. The solar system would have been our lake, decades ago. From the book: ""To visualize Orion, imagine an enormous one-cylinder external combustion engine, a single piston reciprocating within the combustion chamber of empty space. The ship itself, egg-shaped and the height of a twenty-story building, is the piston, armored by a 1,000-ton pusher plate, attached by shock-absorbing legs. The first hundred explosions, fired at half-second intervals, with a total yield equivalent to some 100,000 tons of TNT, would lift the ship from sea level to 125,000 feet.""What a missed opportunity. There's a little documentary footage on Youtube about this project now too, if you're curious.The book is by George Dyson, the son of Freeman Dyson, one of the researchers who worked on the project. It's a well-written, fascinating account of where we might have gone by now."

However, if you have the knowledge to appreciate the ideas and concepts introduced throughout this book, you're in for a real treat, it's your chance to sail through the minds of some of the greatest scientists and engineers that ever lived, and each of them has his own set ideas that will leave you positively stunned."

7,0805072845,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22859487-h-honsinger,5,"This book details, in fascinating and human fashion, one of the great ""what ifs"" of the space age. For several years, in the 1950's and into the early 1960's, a group of nuclear scientists and engineers pursued the very real possibility of launching spacecraft the size of naval vessels using nuclear weapons, and then using more nuclear weapons to propel them around the solar system. This technology, which as far as we know is perfectly feasible, would have allowed ships large enough for a hundred or more scientists to cruise with quite cushy accommodations among the moons of Saturn by 1970.Unfortunately (from the perspective of the author), various treaties banning the detonation of nuclear weapons in space, combined with concerns about health risks posed to the people of Earth caused by the fallout from the bombs, killed the project.The author, George Dyson, is the son of one of the key brains behind the project, the brilliant and influential physicist, Freeman Dyson (ever heard of a ""Dyson Sphere? It's even mentioned in a Star Trek TNG episode). His perspective on the project is not entirely objective, but the reader will forgive that as the clear storytelling allows the reader to share the enthusiasm of the project scientists who believed that they quite literally held in their hands the key to opening up the solar system to human exploration. This could have been a dry, technical exposition of the physics and engineering problems posed by the concept and how they were worked through one by one. It is not. And, it could have been an emotion-charged tale that began with cheer leading for the exciting project and then whining about the narrow-minded bureaucrats who killed it. It is not that, either.Rather, this book--in clear but detailed language--shows the reader an exciting vista of what could have been, tells the fascinating story of the brilliant scientists who worked to open up that vista, and then tells the frustrating but entirely logical story of why that vista was never explored. I enjoyed the book very much--so much that I have read it twice and will probably read it again when I get my own third book finished. This book is a must for anyone interested in space exploration."
8,0805072845,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3265556-converse,3," Project Orion was quite possibly a crazy idea. Conceived of in the late 1950s, Project Orion proposed the propulsion of a space ship by exploding a large number (hundreds) of small (by nuclear standards) fission bombs with the power of up to about 5 kilotons TNT, about the quarter of the size of the Hiroshima bomb. These bombs would be ejected from the space ship and explode behind it. The bombs would vaporize a propellent (which could be just about anything) that would strike a thick steel plate at the bottom of the space ship. This strike would make the ship move. The acceleration would be moderated for the crew by having a set of shock absorbers between the plate and the actual ship. Bombs would be released at intervals of less than a second apart. If desired to launch from earth (!) smaller bombs could be used until the ship reaches beyond the atomsphere or the magnetosphere.   Project Orion was mainly a paper project, developed at General Atomics (still in existence) in California. A very small model propelled by conventional explosives was developed and a film of its launch used for public relations purposes. No actual nuclear explosions were done to advance the project, much to the disappointment of those working on the project. The project suffered from remaining an Air Force project after NASA came into existence, because military applications, although conceivable, always seemed rather forced. The ideas merits only really appear when applied to the problem of how to explore the solar system in a few years, the benefits with regards to putting things into orbit around the Earth are not obvious. In 1965, when it became clear to the Air Force that NASA was not willing to share in the funding, the project died. One reason that NASA didn't support the idea may be that it had a competing idea of using a nuclear reactor to heat hydrogen, the hydrogen then being the propellent. The 1963 ban on atmospheric testing was also a problem, though the notion of hoisting Orion into space on a conventional rocket was explored.   The author's father, physicist Freeman Dyson, worked on this project for a year as a consultant. "
9,0805072845,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44544-r,4,"What would you say to the idea of a spacecraft pushed along by bombs exploding behind it? What if you were told that with atomic bombs the spacecraft could be the size and weight of an oceangoing battleship?Project Orion is a history written by the son of noted Physicist Freeman Dyson. His father was on the research team at General Atomics in the early 1960s that showed such a spacecraft could very likely be built. A filmed test with conventional explosives showed a model vehicle popping upwards. They even held talks with the Coca Cola company to see if very reliable soda can dispenser mechanisms could be adapted to eject microbombs. In the end, the problems of fallout, nuclear proliferation due to the manufacture of thousands of tiny atomic bomblets and the signing of the atmospheric test ban treaty killed the full scale concept.In recent years the idea has occasionally been revived for a mission to Mars, where the nuclear pusher engine would only be used outside of earth's atmosphere."
10,0805072845,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8463644-ed-terrell,4,"My father had taken me outdoors, in the late evening. The year was 1957. He pointed to the sky and asked if I could see the flashing light of the recently launched Russian satellite. The fascination with space, that I felt, has never left me. Project Orion delves in a delightful way into the people, engineering and physics that covered a span of 6 years. And what a project it was: a spaceship powered by atomic bombs surpassing Jules Verne's ""From Earth to the Moon""! Dyson's father, Freeman Dyson, an imminent physicist, was among those scientists. They came from Los Alamos to the beaches of Southern California, to Point Loma, to Torrey Pines and to La Jolla. The project, initiated in 1958, a time when the only space traveler was a dog named Laika, proposed a vehicle weighing 4000 tons that could travel to all the planets in our solar system in a high degree of comfort. Dyson brings an insider's view into the goings on and shares their dreams of space with us, the children of Sputnik."
11,0805072845,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1530294-grover,4,"What an insane idea: create a gigantic spaceship powered by nuclear explosions. Insane enough it just might have worked, were it not that public sentiment turned against all things nuclear, especially exploding bombs in the atmosphere.I found the book a fascinating read and a good look into the ""nuclear culture"" of the late 50s and early 60s, where exploding nuclear devices in the atmosphere was no big deal, and atomic power had limitless possibilities. Another reviewer mentioned that the book was only for nerds who knew their math and physics, and a liberal arts person would have great trouble reading it. I'm FAR from a math whiz—math is the reason I went into Fine Arts—and I found the book easy to read and understand. I'm writing this review about a week after returning the book to the library, and as I recall, there were no equations at all in the text.A wildly crazy idea, yes, and one that might be resurrected in the near future. "
12,0805072845,http://goodreads.com/user/show/95178-eric-k,3,"A detailed history of a fascinating and little known subject, the long-since-abandoned nuclear pulse propulsion project, which would use the kinetic shockwave generated by hydrogen fusion (read: thermonuclear bombs) to ""push"" spacecraft at speeds of up to 0.12c.This is not science fiction -- it is and was all well within the technological / industrial capability of the USA since the late 1950s.The author, Dyson the younger, grew up hearing about this from his famous father, Freeman, and has lots of intriguing anecdotes and insidery access of the ideas and men behind the idea. However, his historiographical acumen doesn't quite match his enthusiasm, making for a stunted read of a wildly compelling topic. Perhaps someday a better writer will take Dyson's work as a primary source for a literary retelling of Project Orion -- therein lies a bestseller."
13,0805072845,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6830314-mark-foskey,3,"It is an amazing thing that a group of first-rate physicists and engineers once took seriously the idea of a capsule the size of a yacht being lofted into space by hundreds of atomic bombs, but they did. A lot of them never quit taking it seriously. My impressions:1. Fallout is a showstopper for the ground-launched version. 2. Launching hundreds of nuclear bombs into space from earth, by whatever means, seems pretty dangerous. Politically it would never fly, and I agree with the public on this one.3. It's still the only plausible way of sending people to the outer solar system, if we ever decide we need to do that.The book was interesting but it didn't sparkle. If you want to know about the Orion project then it's indispensible, but I wanted it to be a book I could enjoy more."
14,0805072845,http://goodreads.com/user/show/928523-michael-pryor,4,"Fascinating stuff. Construct a 4,000 tonne spaceship which is propelled by hundreds of small nuclear bombs? In the late 1950s, this was close to being a reality. Eye-opening stuff, this book is full of tech detail, but it's the people invovled who are the most interesting - full of boundless thinking, wide horizons and intelligence, not only able to think outside the box but able to kick the box aside and leap for the stars. Most of them gradually had the 'Hold on a second' epiphany and re-evaluated their work and the possible proliferation of nukes, but they still retain a wistful image of an early 21st century world where ORION is taking us to the outer planets, supporting a large moon base and pointing the way to the universe."

On the chalkboard it looks something like...let's go visit saturn's rings in a gigantic spaceship and come back real quick. Seriously. Be book focuses a bit more on the science, engineering, and mathematical problems and solutions of the endeavor than your average reader wants to get into...but then again, your average reader isn't picking up this book. The most detailed account of Project Orion you can get without high level government security clearance. Quite technical though, made me want to read a novel instead. "

Methodical yet gripping in unfolding the personal and technical story of as unlikely a project as you'll ever see: propelling an ocean-liner sized spacecraft with nuclear bombs. The best character, by far, is Jerry Astl, in the chapter ""C-4"". A former resistance fighter, aeronautical engineer and explosives expert, his stories from World War 2 add spice to the stories of testing Project Orion. And he's a hoot.The most affecting part to me was Freeman Dyson's narrative of having to choose between Orion and the Partial Test Ban Treaty, both of which he thought could be the savior of humanity on different timescales. Well worth reading. "

The book is poorly written, focusing overlymuch on personal anecdotes and lots of unnecessary background details about the scientists who worked on this project. While an examination of the genesis and development of the project makes sense given its still classified nature, the achronological writing style ruins this.
