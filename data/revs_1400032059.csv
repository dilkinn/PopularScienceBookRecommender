0,1400032059,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25375513-rick-riordan,5,"My favorite recent history book, Mann surveys the breadth and complexity of indigenous cultures in the Americas before the arrival of Columbus. Some of this research was familiar to me. When I taught American history in the 2000s, I would start with such 'snapshots' of Cahokia, the Olmecs, the Serpent Mound, the Maya, the great trade networks that connected the continent. But even that information was hard to find. Good luck finding even a mention of it in the school textbooks. Despite having some knowledge, I was blown away, again, by how populated and cultivated the American landscape was before the cataclysmic arrival of Europeans and their diseases. This book blows up many stubborn, out-dated theories like the singular Bering land-bridge migration, the idea that the land was 'mostly empty' when Europeans arrived, and the idea that most indigenous peoples were 'simple' hunter gatherers. It also gives us a good look at just how stubborn and resistant traditional Euro-American scholarship has been to accepting any new information that didn't fit established theories about the indigenous peoples. None of this will comes as a surprise to indigenous readers themselves, I'm sure, but for me, it was a refreshing, amazing read. I knew nothing about the vast, sophisticated terraforming societies of sub-Amazonian South America, or the pre-Incan empires, or the way that hunter-gatherer people intentionally crafted the landscape to better serve their needs. Mann gave me a tantalizing glimpse into a complex, beautiful pre-Columbian world."
1,1400032059,http://goodreads.com/user/show/173140-brendan,2,"The survey of current thinking on the population of the americas via that Beringia land bridge and the subsequent summary of the evolutions of early american society is interesting.But the repeated comparisons between american society and eurasian society are really fraught and often belabored. The comparisons between the two hemisphere's agriculture and domesticable animals are fine, but the assertion that Aztec (apparently it's more politically correct to call them Mexica) philosophy was as rich as medieval europe's is ludicrous, especially given that such a huge volume of Aztec codices have been preserved and deciphered. The Aztecs did some respectable philosophical work, but Mann's exaggerations aside, they didn't come close to rivaling the work done in ancient Greece, to say nothing of the subsequent 2,000 years of philosophy in Europe (with a nod towards Middle Eastern contributions as well) that took place between the death of Aristotle and the discovery of the new world. Today, it may be possible to take a mesoamerican philosophy course in some university departments, but there are very few (if any) lasting or novel contributions to the the broader discipline of philosophy to be found in Aztec (or Mayan, or Incan) philosophy. There's no shame in that: it has been said that all philosophy is but a footnote to Plato. So why feel the need to exaggerate and mislead readers by making politically correct assertions that have no basis in reality?Also, the distinction the author draws between guilt and responsibility (i.e. 'we' should not feel guilty that Cortes introduced smallpox and wiped out 95% of american indians, but 'we' have some responsibility for this) is way too underdeveloped to be taken seriously. I don't necessarily think that the discussion is even necessary, but it is not an uncommon discussion in US politics, and Mann consciously decides to wade into these waters. First, he never defines 'we,' though it seems he means whites of european descent residing in the new world (and maybe Europeans back in Europe who benefitted from mercantilism/colonialism? It's not clear). And then he never explains how responsibility can be justly divided among descendants; how someone of, say, direct Cortez lineage might have a different level of 'responsibility' than a descendant of an Irish family with no seafaring anscestors and no pedigree in the New World until the late 19th century. And if they have the same 'responsibility,' then does a modern day Chinese or Indian immigrant to the new world also have some responsibility? All unclear, and the absence of even any contemplation of these points leaves the book's attempts at constructing a morality of European/American Indian interaction disappointingly hollow. Mann decided the topic was worthy enough to merit some discussion; it is unfortunate he failed to do the topic any justice."
2,1400032059,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1742824-jason-koivu,5,"This was like a coloring book of pre-Pilgrim North America for me in that it filled in a lot of unanswered questions and brilliantly illuminated some areas of my knowledge that were mere outlines. It stays within the lines and makes my early attempts at coloring in the past look like spidery, seizure-induced scrawlings.Being originally from New England, I'm well aware that there were inhabitants here long before the Europeans arrived. Early on in school we were inundated with stories of Samoset and Squanto, the first Native Americans to make contact with the Plymouth Colony pilgrims, and how in 1621 they strolled into the transplanted Englishmen's village and a big party broke out, thus began the tradition of Thanksgiving. I was (mis)taught in a Massachusetts classroom where heritage and history are king, so much was made of this. We were led to believe the story by elementary schoolteachers who probably wholeheartedly believed it themselves. What about the Virginia Colony of 1607 and their contact with the native inhabitants? It failed, so sweep it under the rug. Something tells me this version of America's founding by Europeans was not the one being taught in Virginia at the time...Never was explained how the two natives could speak English (from Englishmen fishing off of the Maine coast and, in Squanto's case, from abduction and internment for seven years in England) or anything that happened in the Americas prior to the pilgrims landing. Oh sure there was talk of Incas and Mayans and their all important maize. But the extent, the sheer size of the native tribes, clans, and cosmopolitan societies of the Americas, north and south, and how Europe brought it all down upon their heads, none of this was discussed. Why? Because even during the late 1970s and early 80s when the movement to turn the Native Americans into mystical caretakers of Mother Earth, there was still a prejudicial sense of 'white is right' prevalent, at least in the neighborhood I grew up in. The other reason is a plain lack of knowledge. My simple teachers simply did not know. They can't wholly be blamed. The information wasn't readily available or flat-out wasn't available. School books were traditional and outdated. The grey-area material was swept under the rug. Now there is less grey-area material - advances in technology and archaeological practices have greatly advanced our knowledge of the past in just a few short decades - but there's still plenty of unknown patches of time in the western hemisphere. In 1491 Mann does not shy away from them. Having said that, it should be noted that this is not just about North America. No, in fact more time is spent on everything below it. Through discovered texts and deciphered inscriptions there's just more known about Mesoamerica than the other areas, so yes, there are pages upon pages about those Incas and Mayans. In general what I love about 1491 is that it doesn't take the Indians' side or the Europeans'. It doesn't try to cast a glowing angelic light upon the native inhabitants to transform them into woodland spirits whose only concern was the preservation of the trees and the birds, etc blah blah blah (Earth Day is quaint and misguided, but I digress...), nor does Mann attempt to attack or defend the actions of the Europeans. All is more of a statement of fact or, if lacking concrete evidence, a statement of possibility based on sound theory.Sure, this distills oceans of scholarly study down to a more manageable duck pond, but it never tries to pretend it is doing otherwise. Mann is no pretender to vaunted erudition. He's a journalist who's done some research. He's a guy who realized his own grade school education was lacking, and when he found out the moldy stuff he was taught way back when was still being taught to his son he decided to do something about it. I'm glad for it."
3,1400032059,http://goodreads.com/user/show/228648-douglas-hunter,4,"As someone who writes professionally in this area (unabashed plug: watch for God's Mercies, Doubleday Canada, in October 07) I have high praise for this title, a long-overdue assessment of native culture and civilization before (and at) contact with Europeans. I'm still reading it, but I've been impressed so far.[I've now finished, see below.] Anyone who enjoyed it should also consider Elaine Dewar's Bones, which explores the archaeological controversy of how long people have been in the New World. (She wholeheartedly supports the ""a really, really long time"" camp.)My only critique of 1491, and it is minor, is that the author I feel overstates the case that Europeans (mainly English) did not enjoy a military superiority over the natives, that their powder weapons were ineffective. This is a rather generous reading of native military capability. The English army did away with the longbow in 1598, and for all their problems, powder weapons were a clear advantage. Frenchman Samuel de Champlain used just three harquebus to devastating effect against the Iroquois (Haudenosaunee) in 1609, and in his trade and colonization monopoly, secured in 1612 under the Prince de Cond√©, the terms specifically forbid anyone to trade powder weapons with the natives, under penalty of a 10,000 livre fine and corporal punishment. One of the key factors in European inability not to immediately conquer or eradicate native populations by force was the sheer lack of firepower. (They also needed them as trade partners.) These commercial ventures (English and French in particular) didn't have the full might of their states behind them in the early contact period. Had England or France made up their mind to truly ""conquer"" these shores and their peoples, they would have marched through them much like de Soto did in the southeastern US in the mid 16th century, for good or for ill (pretty well for ill). But an idea the author does well to advance is the fact that coastal nations or tribes that made contact with the newcomers often came to decide that they should secure a strategic advantage and enlist the newcomers' aid in fighting their own enemies. It was a complicated time, and 1491 is a worthy overview. Having now finished, I'll still recommend it. For those interested in precontact cultures north of 49 (as in half of North America) the lack of material about French Canada is a little disappointing. There's nothing about the much-debated vanishing of the Iroquoian-speaking residents of the St. Lawrence (at Hochelaga and Stadacona) who were there in large numbers in palisade villages when Cartier first visited in the 1530s, but had vanished utterly by the time Champlain showed up in 1603. But that's nitpicky, considering the enormous scope of this work. "
4,1400032059,http://goodreads.com/user/show/175635-trevor,5,"You know ‚Äì in fourteen-hundred-and-ninety-two Columbus sailed the ocean blue. So, 1491 was a particularly interesting year for the inhabitants of the Americas. This is a remarkably similar story to that told in Dark Emu. It is almost as if everything I‚Äôve ever known about pre-European settlement in Australia and the Americas has been, well, utter rubbish. Which is more than a little annoying.What is very interesting here is that we seem to have grossly under-estimated both the population of the Americas prior to European arrival and also the extent of farming ‚Äì including farming in the Amazon basin, a particularly interesting part of this book. The author suggests that the local Indian populations in the Amazon effectively created the forest to meet human needs and that this was then able to support a much larger population than we would otherwise have estimated and one much more ‚Äòadvanced‚Äô than we assume too.All of this has consequences and implications, of course, because we could and should learn a lot from peoples who have farmed the land for thousands of years before we arrived and who did so in ways that appear to have been much more sustainable than anything we have achieved since. This book covers far too much ‚Äì in fact, so much so that after a while my head was almost spinning. We travel across both continents. Sometimes there is so much detail involving the pre-European arrival political struggles and murders that it pays to remember that if the Indians had invaded the UK at around this same time they‚Äôd have come just after the War of the Roses. You know, what I‚Äôm saying is that Europe was in no position to criticise other countries and their monarchies for their internecine murders and battles. The thing that has shifted how I understand this history involves a kind of key provided by this book to understanding what happened. Basically Europeans were filthy since we lived with lots of animals and so we brought horrible, horrible diseases to the Americas. The local populations had no defence against such diseases and also had a remarkably narrow gene pool (are pools narrow? Maybe it was a shallow pool.) Either way, it seems that up to 95% of the local populations were killed by diseases like small pox. We can hardly imagine what that would mean. The debate still rages about whether the Europeans intentionally spread these diseases (although, another book I have read on this said that James the First referred to small pox as a gift from God ‚Äì so, it wasn‚Äôt as if we were particularly upset about the inferno that we allowed to sweep before us as we arrived in the New World. What is clear is that not only did the population collapse, entire civilisations were brought to their knees. And as we arrived we often assumed that what we found was what had been, with us completely unaware we were witnessing societies suffering under dire stress. The author makes it very clear that what we were seeing was a grossly distorted vision of what had previously existed. I‚Äôve never fully understood the implications of this. Let‚Äôs say, for the sake of argument, that some disease came to Melbourne, where I live, a city of about 5 million people, and it wiped out 95% of everyone. Obviously, all of the normal things you might expect to be going on in a city would come to a screaming halt. You would be unlikely to be able to catch a tram, for instance, or buy milk at the local supermarket if 19 in every 20 people suddenly stopped living. And the people left would be without nearly everyone they have known and loved ‚Äì so, not particularly happy, if you know what I mean. But that would only be the beginning of the problems. Let‚Äôs say none of the animals died in this catastrophe. The estimate is that 62% of households in Melbourne have pets, and there are 20 dogs per 100 people, which would mean all of a sudden there would be 20 dogs for every five people. If their owners are dead, then presumably many of these dogs would be pretty hungry and some of them would be out and about looking for food, probably in packs. If you arrived a year or so after the catastrophe, Melbourne would look like a pretty frightening place with lots of hungry and presumably angry dogs walking the streets. You might wonder what the hell was the matter with these people that they had so many damn dogs and didn‚Äôt even bother to look after them.This is effectively what is suggested to have happened with bison. That is, that the removal of humans from farm lands across the continent provided bison with an ideal situation to go through a population explosion. And this then left the Europeans who arrived assuming the Indians spent all of their time hunting bison without ever seeming to diminish the population of them, whereas the bison were actually just taking advantage of the Indian farms that were now no longer farms due to the Indians having died off due to disease. There is a bit of Bill Bryson‚Äôs A Walk in the Woods where he talks of the extinction of various types of birds that had swarmed in such profusion when Europeans arrived that the Europeans basically went nuts killing and eating them. This is presented as proof of European disregard for nature ‚Äì something that is self-evidently true, by the way. But in this case the birds were also an oddity. Because the Indian farmers had died, the corn harvests were left in the fields, the amount of food available for these birds exploded and with that so too did their populations. What Europeans witnessed and considered normal were in fact a consequence of removing humans from what had been a human-made landscape. And once you do that, other animals take the opportunity to flourish. This book has shifted how I understand the pre-European Americas ‚Äì if you are from the Americas, you should read this, not only because it is a fascinating read, but also because it will serve as a useful reminder of a cultural heritage you still have responsibilities for. Just as we Australians can never be reconciled with the land until we help to heal the wound we have made by our terrible and tragic history, so too the Americas have a debt that needs to be repayed."
5,1400032059,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10571559-hana,2,"See updated alternative reading recommendations below.Well, I finally finished it. There were some interesting factoids, such as the theory that much of the Amazon rainforest was planted by humans, but even then the data were not marshaled in a convincing, coherent fashion. Over all, the book was badly organized, the chapter and section headings provided no clue to their purpose, the text jumped wildly across continents and thousands of years for no logical reason and technical terms were too often introduced but never defined (I had to look up MFAC in the index to discover it meant Maritime Foundation of Andean Civilization). By far the best part of the book were the aerial photographs that clearly showed the size and complexity of South America's ancient farms and cities. The maps were useful as well, but aides such as a pronunciation guide or a timeline were among the many missing elements.And it's not just the organization of the book that is a challenge; the writing style is difficult as well. One sentence goes on for 27 lines. The author mixes metaphors with such abandon that I often despaired of untangling the meaning: ""Peru is the cow-catcher on the train of continental drift. Leading South America's slow, grinding march toward Australia, its coastline hits the ocean floor and crumples up like a carpet shoved into a chair-leg.""I simply cannot fathom why so many people thought this book was so wonderful. I will have to look elsewhere for a coherent analysis of this topic. Updated Recommendations:For an excellent analysis of some of the earliest evidence of human habitation in North America, consider Settlement Of The Americas A New Prehistory--it is more scholarly as well as being much more readable and interesting. Timothy Egan's Short Nights of the Shadow Catcher: The Epic Life and Immortal Photographs of Edward Curtis is an interesting introduction to one of the most definitive chronicles of Native American cultures in North America. Curtis' entire multi-volume original work is available online at this Northwestern University site.I have not read this one yet, but I hear good things about The Last Days of the Incas from my friends at the History Book Club.The 1491 factoid about the Amazon rainforests having been heavily cultivated for extended periods of time seems likely to be correct. See this fascinating article about the rainforest's maroon people from National Geographic."
6,1400032059,http://goodreads.com/user/show/274193-jason,4,"Very well written, a good mixture of factual evidence and narrative. The main take home point here should be known to everyone, especially Americans. There is a reason why there was a period of 128 years between Colombus' landing and a permanent European settlement in North America. Namely, there were millions of Native Americans there who thought Europeans were dirty, amusing creatures who had interesting objects but were not fit for being neighbors. Attempted European settlers were continuously driven out. When one tribe finally took pity on the English settlement of Plymouth, it was only because a smallpox epidemic had killed vast numbers of the them off, and they were concerned about being run over by their enemies, who had not yet suffered this fate. It is likely that were it not for the outbreaks of smallpox, preceding many of the first European scouts moving westward, that America would have never been a country. Oh yeah, and concerning South America, there is evidence that much, possibly 70-80%, of the Amazon forest is man-made. This is definitely a well researched & eye opening book that will challenge the idea that Native Americans were a sparse people who had no effect on their environment and let things be on their own. The only reason people think that most Native Americans were purely nomadic hunters was because the smallpox had killed off most of the 'urbanized' settlements that required agriculture."
7,1400032059,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6603759-misericordia-the-serendipity-aegis,5,"I'm astonished at how many people mention in their reviews that they are surprised at how rich and varied and impressive the cultures of the Americas were until a certain point. Many of them actually live on the said continents. How do you even live on a continent and know little about its history? What, did anyone think the Aztec were a bunch of barbarians? Did anyone think Columbus arrived to find an unpopulated part of the world? Maybe because said history gets understated treatment (if not outright dismissal) in history education? I think this is a prime example of history getting bent (in the best tradition illustrated in 1984) to reach certain ends.This book is not so much innovative (quite a lot of all this had been published way before in professional research literature, 'traduit' to lots of languages). What it does is make this particular corner of history accessible to laymen.Some points controversial, of course, as is usual with research in shady regions of history. Still, some are actually plenty good.Full review to follow. "
8,1400032059,http://goodreads.com/user/show/216786-ken-ichi,3,"In brief: I felt this was an adequate, often fascinating summary of human habitation of the Americas prior to the arrival of Europeans as understood by present-day historians and scientists. I was happy to see that Mann highlighted controversial areas without simply adopting one side of any given controversy, and in general it seemed like a balanced, well-researched book. That said, there were numerous peccadillos.Mann starts with the basic assertion that the West's primary mistake in our conception of American Indians is that we have generally seen them as unchanging features in a primeval wilderness. This, he argues, is dehumanizing, regardless of whether you prefer to prefix ""savage"" with ""noble,"" because a people incapable of change seems incapable of will, of thought, of ingenuity.He attempts to dismantle this notion by presenting research supporting 3 broad ideas:1) pre-Columbian population estimates are now assumed to be much higher than previously thought (i.e. between the time of first contact and the colony at Plymouth, humanity in the Americans witnessed a massive die-off)2) humans were present in North America for tens of thousand of years, and the complexity of their societies were comparable with with Eurasian counterparts3) Indians could and did exert influence over the natural worldOn the whole, I think Mann made convincing arguments for the broad stokes. However, there were a number of things that set me off, most of them centering around my suspicion that Mann was trying harder to convince than reveal. Maybe this stems from his journalistic rather than academic background, but I constantly felt cajoled when what I wanted to feel was ""of course!""First of all there was the general lack of methods. Reconstructing history is a tricky business fraught with error, so when you're trying to communicate a challenging and controversial notion like the number of American Indians who died as a result of European diseases, I think you need to go into excruciating detail about how population numbers are derived. To his credit, Mann touches on it, but he treats the issue of error as a sort of footnote, noting one scientist who thinks the degree of error makes the numbers meaningless. Throughout the book I found myself asking, ""But how do we know that?"" and was generally disappointed by the number and quality of the citations (sources often include interviews, personal communication, and secondary sources that themselves lack citation). To provide another example, on p. 234 he describes how Olmecs deformed the pliant skulls of their infants to make them look a certain way... only to admit archaeologists only assume they did this based on their artwork. No ellipsis can adequately contain my stupefaction at the absurdity of that claim. Have you seen Mesoamerican artwork? Have you seen any human artwork prior to Enlightenment Europe? Not exactly the height of realism. Perusing his source, it seems that the figurines looked deformed, and intentional deformation was apparently documented elsewhere in Mesoamerica, but the citation trail goes Spanish there, so I'm lost. If there were first-hand accounts of similar practices, you need to describe them. In the text. Because shaping baby skulls is WEIRD by our standards.There were other portions that just seemed irrational and/or unscientific. His attempt to equate human sacrifice among the Mexica (aka Aztecs) and 17th century executions in Britain was a bit ridiculous, as fellow Goodreads user Stefan pointed out (p. 134). On p. 172 he actually describes error ranges for carbon dating as ""typographical clutter"" [muffled howl of rage]. On p. 291 he writes, ""Indians [...] began systematically replanting large belts of woodland, transforming them into orchards for fruit and mast."" He cites Krummer (an Atlantic Monthly article about chestnut restoration) and himself, neither of which mention Indian planting. You get the picture.Finally, I found his constant comparisons to Europe and the general sense of hand-wringing and guilt a bit trying, and that's coming from a self-avowed Western liberal hand-wringer. Two back-to-back quotes sum this up nicely:""The complexity of a society's technology has little to do with its level of social complexity‚Äìsomething that we, in our era of rapidly changing seemingly overwhelming technology, have trouble grasping."" (p. 250)""But where Europe had the profoundly different civilizations of China and Islam to steal from, Mesoamerica was alone in the world."" (p. 251)The sagacity of the former idea and the absurd implication that cultural and technological interchange in Eurasia was both one-way and morally wrong perfectly describe 2/3 of the Ueda-Mann Venn diagram.But like I said, on the whole pretty good. I found the penultimate bit about defining our relationship to nature and the final section about the role American Indian concepts of freedom and individuality may have influenced the founding of the United States super intriguing, worth books of their own. Maybe that's where he's going with 1493.

9,1400032059,http://goodreads.com/user/show/666892-felicia,5,"Fascinating exploration of what we know of the ""New World"" before Columbus arrived. I knew pretty much nothing about the Incas, the Mayans, the Aztecs, and all the other societies that actually were possibly BIGGER than Europe in 1492, and dwarfed it in centuries before. It's also an interesting survey of these societies and their environments, of how the Indians and the ""pristine"" environments are a bit of a myth. The scope of the book covers so many different culture, puts everything into a context I never imagined before.The author obviously loves what he does, and relishes research and it definitely makes potentially dry material come to life. Opened my eyes to a subject I knew nothing about, so I highly recommend!!!!"
10,1400032059,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2366515-n-k-jemisin,5,"Mindblowing. Everyone should read this book. It's amazing to me how much historians got wrong -- and what this book illuminates is why historians get such things wrong. Some of it is flat-out racism and ethnocentrism -- historians' tendency to dismiss oral tradition as crap, for example, when it turns out most Indian groups have done a good job of keeping track of their own past. Some of it, however, was simply lost knowledge that's only now being rediscovered, with the aid of modern technology and research methods. Changed the way I view the world. Truly stunning stuff."
11,1400032059,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31384949-ian,3,"This book has already been widely reviewed. Many other reviewers have outlined the basic 3 premises that the book advances. The book is extremely well-researched. The author has spoken with numerous experts and covered an enormous amount of territory, and on the whole he presents fairly convincing arguments. Most people do I think accept that the Indian population of the Americas experienced a catastrophic crash after 1492, due primarily to the introduction of Old World diseases, but Mann presents this simple fact from another angle. He points out that the earliest European explorers described a heavily populated continent, with numerous towns and even cities. A century or so later their successors described an empty wilderness. Even the huge forests, vast herds of bison and the unimaginably large flocks of passenger pigeons, all of which we tend to associate with early post-colonial North America, were, Mann argues, developments that took place only after the Indian population was drastically reduced post 1492. The author also seeks to change our view of Indian civilisations, arguing persuasively that many Indian societies developed highly complex and effective agricultures as well as independently developing writing, and that in both cases they may have been amongst the earliest in the World to do so.Unfortunately at times the author falls into the trap of overstating his case. He praises Mesoamerican philosophy, and compares it to that of Ancient Greece and China. In support of his argument he provides some rather unimpressive evidence from the Mexica (aka the Aztecs), consisting largely of creation myths and some simplistic questions such as ""In the Beyond, are we still dead or do we live?"" Perhaps realising the thinness of his evidence, the author asserts that ""Cut short by Cortes, Mexica philosophy did not have the chance to reach as far as Greek or Chinese philosophy."" This is speculative. As the author himself sets out, dozens if not scores of Indian civilisations had risen and fallen over millennia, and there is no reason to suppose that the fate of the Mexica or the Inca would have been any different, had the Europeans not arrived. Moreover the author finishes the book with a last chapter in which he seems to argue that worldwide ideas of political liberty derive mainly from the Haudenosaunee (The League of the Iroquois). I am not seeking to denigrate the Haudenosaunee, which was an impressive achievement, and I realise the author would be seeking to finish with a flourish, but I find this claim to be a wild exaggeration, totally ignoring the extent to which Ancient Greek ideas of democracy, liberty and equality before the law influenced the 18th Century Enlightenment, and the extent to which the political philosophy of the Enlightenment was inextricably linked with the Scientific Revolution and the challenges it posed to tradition and faith. Regrettably the book's very last paragraph contains two statements that I found to be simply absurd, and for me this rather soured the rest of the arguments the author advanced."
12,1400032059,http://goodreads.com/user/show/867938-tripp,5,"Author Charles Mann's purpose is to debunk three commonly held ideas about the Americas before Columbus: that the continents were sparsely populated, that the social and technical development was limited and that the locals left the environment untouched.In discussing scholarly debates on these subjects, he convincingly argues that the population, before the decimation of disease, was quite high. The debate is just how many people there were rather than whether the continents were pristine unoccupied lands waiting for the taking. The major factor here is the spread of Old World disease.On the question of social and cultural development, he argues that Peru and Mesoamerica should be counted among the birthplaces of human culture. While they didn't develop in the same way as Asian or European societies, they represent great achievements that best took advantage of their situation.His final point is that the locals were extensive modifiers of the environment. In fact he goes so far as to say that the Amazon as we know it is the result of thousands of years of human engineering.All of these arguments have their foes and Mann gives them room in the book as well. It's a fair, easy to read book that will likely educate and entertain all but specialists."
13,1400032059,http://goodreads.com/user/show/79757330-philip-allan,3,"As a white man educated in the 1970s and 80s, I am aware of the limitations of the western-view of world history I was taught. As a result, I am always on the lookout for books that might offer me a different perspective, and was delighted when several Goodreads friends recommended 1491 to me. As a survey of pre-Columbian America, it does not disappoint. Mann combines first hand reportage with a survey of the current evidence to reveal a Lost World. Some aspects of the narrative were familiar ‚Äì the travails of the Mayan civilisations, for example, but others were not. The density of the indigenous population of North America before the arrival of European diseases, for example, came as a surprise to this reader, as did the extraordinary idea that the large forests of the Amazon and Eastern United States might be the result of centuries of landscape management by their residents. All in all, this is a fascinating book that is unafraid to debunk most of our perceived views about the New World. Charles Mann‚Äôs work is not without faults, however. His unquestioning approval of Native American culture leads him to overlook some of the more brutal practices of aggressive cultures such as the Inca and Aztecs ‚Äì human sacrifice being the most obvious example. He also displays evidence in such an even-handed way (on the one hand, on the other hand) that at times I found myself longing to hear what he actually thought. Mann also uses a device of setting up a particular view point over a number of pages, only to tear it down with new evidence once the reader has absorbed his initial argument. This approach is effective the first time it is used, but becomes irritating as the book progresses and it is repeated again and again. That said, 1491 is a very valuable contribution to a little understood part of human history."
14,1400032059,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1202617-stefan,1,"This book could be good. Unfortunately the author seems determined in every part of his ""research"" to interject his own opinion without duly backing it up. I stopped reading it somewhere around page 100, where the author makes the comparison between ritual human sacrifice by the Aztecs and executions in European countries. By taking the executions in England for a 100 year period, then adjusting for the size of the English population compared to the estimated possible population of the Aztecs, and comparing that yearly execution total with what Cortez estimated, Mann concludes that Europeans were more bloodthirsty. Despite my issues with the math behind these comparisons, I'm still left wondering what Mann's point is.That becomes my issue with the book. Mann presents a lot of good factual arguments, but then includes hints of his own opinions that don't really contribute to Mann's argument that New World cultures surpass what has been previously estimated, assumed, and ingrained into our own culture."
15,1400032059,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1874239-bruce,5,"Let me start by noting that Mann is a journalist, rather than a historian or cultural anthropologist. This results in a work that is extremely accessible to the non specialist reader and lacking in jargon. So much of our notions of what North America was like before Europeans arrived are the result of our own impact on the continent. The notion of an empty continent populated by either ""noble savages"" or aborigines comes from the fact that the population was decimated by western diseases within a 100 years of our arrival. Mann shows that Native American cultures were highly civilized and complex, with enormous centers of population and highly organized agricultural and political societies. He shows that when Europeans came to North America, they were not seeing a ""state of nature"" but rather a continent that had already been significantly changed by the agricultural practices of its inhabitants. We tend to think of small villages of teepees or cave dwellings. But Mann shows that the populations of the America were equivalent to those of Europe in 1500, and that there were large, organized communiteis throughout the continent. Some of the largest of these, such as the cities of the mound people of the plains, or Tenochtitlan in South America, were enormous in scale, and highly civilized. There was so much here before we arrived, and its important to remember this. "
16,1400032059,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57274851-ash,3,"It‚Äôs been a while since I‚Äôve read a work of nonfiction, and I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever read one for pleasure and not as a school requirement. I chose this as my first because I‚Äôve always wanted to learn more about American Indian history. I knew before picking up 1492 that I received a woefully inadequate education on the subject in school and I‚Äôm eager to make up for that.I can‚Äôt speak to the accuracy of 1492, so this review will focus only on how readable it was and how much I enjoyed it. Charles C. Mann‚Äôs writing style is very journalistic; unsurprising, given his career as, well, a journalist. As someone who regularly binges longreads from my favorite online publications, this style worked for me. It‚Äôs not a book you stay up all night reading in a marathon binge session; rather, it‚Äôs a book you digest slowly and thoroughly to squeeze out every last drop of information.It‚Äôs evident from the beginning that Mann has opinions. He focuses on the theories that he believes are closest to the truth. Some have more hard evidence to support them than others; Mann is honest when he presents a theory that‚Äôs based more on speculation, and he outlines some of the critics‚Äô main arguments. However, this clearly wasn‚Äôt meant to be an unbiased presentation of data; the purpose, rather, is to convince readers that pre-Columbian American Indian societies were more complex than history books have usually given them credit for. I knew that going into the book and didn‚Äôt have a problem with how it was carried out.I found the majority of the information in this book interesting, but there were sections here and there that didn‚Äôt captivate me. There were also several instances where I thought Mann could have explained a concept more straightforwardly and in fewer words than he did. I rate 1492 three stars because at times it was too dense for me, but I would still highly recommend it to anyone wanting to learn more about American Indian history."
17,1400032059,http://goodreads.com/user/show/832416-nick,3,"Confession: I never finished this, leaving about 50 pages (about 15%)on the table. With non-fiction books that are based around a particular theory I feel like as long as I read enough to internalize the argument and really understand some of the evidence I can stop reading when I get bored. If I missed some revelation on page 420 somebody let me know.The key takeaway here: American societies were almost certainly older, larger, more technically advanced and more complex than they are given credit for. While this is basically a no brainer for most of us, actually reading all of the evidence and the history of the discovery is really interesting.Another takeaway: Archeology is NOT an exact science. In fact, it seems to basically consist of making a discovery and then claiming your discovery is unimpeachable fact until someone else discovers something older that makes your discovery obsolete. Its like a crappy metaphor for life.Finally: Interesting factoid. It seems like no one can come to a consensus on how corn originated as a crop. The genetic ancestors of the plant are so small and nutrient deficient that they cant figure out how the South Americans managed to cultivate it into the powerful food staple it is today. Probably alien intervention if you ask me.."

19,1400032059,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29075798-adam,5,"Review of the audiobook narrated by Darrell Dennis.I find pre-Columbian history of the Americas fascinating so this book was right up my alley. It did jump around a little more than I liked, but overall this is a great presentation of all of the contemporary findings and generally accepted conclusions (as of 2005) on both the state of culture in the Americas before 1492 and the affect that European settlement/conquering had on said culture beginning in 1492.The first part tells the story of what the Americas were like immediately before Columbus' journey. Told mostly through the first person accounts of the Europeans who witnessed with their own eyes, Mann uses those observations to paint a snapshot of the lives and cultures of Native Americans at that fateful time. Most notable is the contrasting of chronicles of the very first who explored (seeing a continent teeming with people) with those who came later (seeing a mostly empty and undisturbed environment) thanks to the diseases the Europeans brought to the Americas which swept ahead of them.The second and third parts are interesting as well, exploring archaeological research, various dating technologies, agricultural advancements (many foods which are now associated with countries, such as tomatoes and Italy, were originally cultured by Native Americans) and the history of a number of different cultures, including the Clovis, Olmec and Maya. Overall this is a great book for anyone interested in American Indian or pre-Columbian history.History doesn't have the same narration demands as the fiction that I spend most of my time listening to as there typically aren't an array of different characters that need to be given distinct voices. The difficulty in narrating this book is with the pronunciations of all of the different places and people(s), which Darrell Dennis does flawlessly. In looking him up after finishing the book I see that he is a Native American (First Nations) actor. Retrospectively, this does give his narration more credibility than I had been attributing it as he does sound like your average reader.Final verdict: 4.5 star story, 4.5 star narration, 4.5 stars overall"
20,1400032059,http://goodreads.com/user/show/113969-aili,3,"So the major thing to note here is that this is a history of the inhabitants of pre-Columbian Western Hemisphere... written by a feature journalist. It has a lot of straight history, but also a lot of information gleaned from non-standard or new techniques, such as archaeology, forensic science, and linguistics. Oh, and actually talking to folks who identify as indigenous -- who are, lots of them, still around.A fair amount of the material was familiar to me from taking Colonial Latin America (taught by the awesome Prof. Cope) in college and from reading Guns, Germs, and Steel [and it's clear that the author totally hearts Jared Diamond]. But even with that background, there was enough new/interesting stuff to keep me entertained.The downside is also the upside: as a journalist, the author is prone to kind of florid prose, which I found distracting but others (I hear) find exciting.He also jumps around a lot -- it was unclear from the chapter titles what themes would be covered, or where, or who. The thread within a given chapter can jump from maps of the Amazon Basin to a Short History of the Fall of the Inkan [sic] Empire to How to Make Tortillas in Oaxaca, Mexico. The lack of overall structure meant that the author has to keep explicitly stating his extremely general goal: ""I just wanna write about these folks because the current history paradigm totally fails to."" Because otherwise you might forget it or wonder why he's spending 10 pages discussing a somewhat arbitrarily-chosen Mayan civil war in extreme detail.His intention is laudable, but having such a general goal means that there's no clear build-up to a conclusion. So it's very easy to flip or page through this book, but it's kind of boring to read it straight through."
21,1400032059,http://goodreads.com/user/show/163833-ian,5,"Mann is not a historian, but rather is a journalist. And for that reason, this book does read like a history text (like Guns, Germs, and Steel). But it is exceptionally researched and fantastic.Mann describes North and South America in a way that traditional textbooks and contemporary rhetoric never acknowledges. He combats the old-fashioned and anti-academic beliefs that pervade our Eurocentric version of world history (summed up in what he calls ""Holmberg's Mistake,"" a reading I give my students at the start of our U.S. Literature class). Marvin Harris tries to ""de-mystify the world's mysteries,"" and Mann does that with the ""New"" World's mysteries in this text.He tells the true story of the Pilgrims, Jamestown, the Mayas, the Aztecs (or Triple Alliance), and the Incas. He also introduces most readers to Hopewell Indians, Mississippian Indians like the Cahokians, and other groups that built powerful empires and established incredibly technologically-advanced cultures prior to European contact - all without the help of steel, guns, trade with Asia, or beasts of burden. The unfortunate aspect of Mann's book, though, is that it will likely be out of date fairly soon. Much of his information is current scholarship; the investigation of pre-Columbus North and South America is ever-changing. But that just means there will be more to read in the near future (hopefully)."
22,1400032059,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,5,"This is an excellent book that describes the civilizations in North, Central, and South America before (and shortly after) the arrival of Columbus. Many facets of these civilizations are quite impressive. For example, the agricultural method of inter-planting different species of crops in a plot of land was a wonderful approach for keeping farms fertile over long periods of time, even millennia. This farming method was much better--and more efficient--than the European method of rotating crops. Some of the ""forests"" of the Amazon are actually the remnants of ancient orchards, where people could just ""live off of the land"" by picking fruits off of trees. Indians in North America would burn off the underbrush in forests every year, creating forests that were more akin to parks than wilderness.The most impressive part of the book was the last chapter, a recounting of the Haudenosaunee (Iroquois) Indians. They lived as a single social class. They could not fathom the European class system. They didn't understand why servants and slaves didn't simply ""walk away"" to freedom. Their approach to freedom and independence had a great influence on founding fathers of the United States, and to this day, around the world."
23,1400032059,http://goodreads.com/user/show/184521-john,5,"I am rethinking my review and giving this the highest rating. This book has really stayed with me in the months since I read it. I'm always a sucker for prehistory stuff, people speculating on history and social structure and motivations for doing things when all you have to go on are oral history and some artifacts but nothing written down. And there is so much we don't know about the Native Americans, even though we act as if we do. This book reminds the reader that we base all our knowledge about Indian tribes on what they were like when we managed to really sit down and chat with them starting in the mid 1600's on the east coast and really the 1700's for the interior, and we didn't know much about the western tribes even by Lewis and Clark, in 1802. But the european contact affected them much earlier. You can see that even with tribes like the Wampanoag, who the Pilgrims met. The Pilgrims had time to sit in their villages and really write about what they were like, but by that point they had been trading with Europeans for almost a hundred years, european goods were ingrained in their society, and the first waves of disease had already arrived via fishing boats. The society was very different from what it had originally been. And so with plains tribes, this was even more of a big deal. A tribe like the cheyenne or sioux, let's say. We really don't record anything about them until the 1800s. But they started getting things from us, not only traded goods but also diseases, in the 1500s. They traded with tribes who traded with tribes who traded with the spanish. That's 300 years of change! It's not that far fetched to think that maybe in 1830 some of these nomadic plains tribes were living in tipis and surviving only on what they could hunt because 150 years ago their societies were decimated by disease and they were forced to become nomadic hunter-gatherers. But what we learn in school is only what we can prove: the Cheyenne were a small tribe of hunter-gatherers that lived a meager existence on the plains, subsisting mostly on buffalo. This makes it sound like they were always FAR behind the europeans, which might not have been true. Another interesting theory. Remember learning about the thundering herds of buffalo, millions strong, dominating the plains. You just figure it must have always been like that, until the europeans came along. But we ignore that the dominant predator for the buffalo was the native american. And European diseases caused possibly 75% of the native american population to die, round about 1700. So what we really saw in the 1800s was a massive population surge of buffalo, because the only people eating them had vanished.Plus there's all kinds of great writing in here about how advanced the Incans were how they may have had a written language after all, but using knots on rope, which is really cool when you think about it. I think people would find history a lot more interesting if they talked about this kind of stuff in school. Maybe it's just me. "
24,1400032059,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1105306-lois,3,"Sigh, Holmberg didn't 'make a mistake' he used scientific racism. His scientific determinations about Native Americans aren't mistakes. Racism is a form of control and therefore ALWAYS intentional.If an author is unprepared to deal with white folks behaving badly because of racism, he should've picked another continent on which to set this. As it stands this stance is disrespectful to the very people who's history he's supposed to be providing. Racism is never a mistake or oversight. The author's inability to leave Europeans out of a book that doesn't include them is annoying. His inability to hold the perpetrators of this genocide accountable is dangerous. Pulling histories for marginalized peoples out of white folks records is a standard method of study and many of the biographies I've read employ this technique. In the beginning generally the author explains where the info/facts/history comes from, the records of the farm or plantation etc, without making those whites the center of the story. No attempt is made to give the subjects that same dignity in this narrative.Yet for all it's flaws it is a groundbreaking book that ties all of this research together in one place. Just do not give any weight to the author's conclusions. One of the author's main goals here is to expose the mistaken history while protecting white supremacy. It's an intricate dance that ultimately fails.If this interests you aptn.ca (aboriginal peoples television network) made an 8 part series with this same name. It's considerably better as it includes much more info than exists in this book or I'm told 1493. Also it's created by Native Americans/ First Nations so no need to protect white supremacy. This show is also available on Vimeo. I rarely suggest this but in this case, skip the book watch the show. The history is more accurate and Europeans are non-existent, as they should be in 1491 Americas."
25,1400032059,http://goodreads.com/user/show/974210-erik-graff,5,"Tom Miley told me to read his copy of this book while I was visiting him and his family in San Francisco. It was an excellent suggestion. Rarely have I read a book filled with so much information contrary to what I thought I knew.1491 basically summarizes recent researches suggesting that the Americas were populated earlier than previously believed, more densely populated than commonly estimated and more widely civilized.One of the more interesting stories in this book is about the civilization(s) along the Amazon. Like Hadingham's Lines of the Mountain Gods, Mann's account details a breakthrough which occurred as a result of a researcher thinking to simply ask current inhabitants about signs of civilization which might accord with the generally discredited earliest accounts of Europeans following the course of the river. The accounts had mentioned town after town, but when later explorers visited no signs remained. The natives, however, knew of artificial riparian hills, hills of potsherds, enough to indicate both a large and relatively sophisticated population whose other artifacts, made of woods and other organic substances, had long since disintegrated. This further correlated with the peculiar distribution patterns of trees bearing edible fruit, patterns suggestive of an arboreal milpa culture. The rainforest, much of it, might be more a tree garden gone to seed than a primeval jungle.The book contains many stories such as this, stories which are joined by a grand, speculative narrative about the broad scope of human history and pre-history in the Americas before the arrival of the Europeans."
26,1400032059,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25882000-joe,4,"As Mann ‚Äúsuggests‚Äù in his preface many of us have been taught that prior to Christopher Columbus showing up, North and South America were pristine lands, sparsely populated by primitive Indians with unsophisticated cultures, who lived at the mercy of Mother Nature. Combining archaeology, history, science and even some psychology/sociology ‚Äì and as the subtitle suggests ‚Äì The author paints a very different picture of the ‚ÄúNew World‚Äù before it was ‚Äúdiscovered‚Äù. And for the most part 1491 is a fascinating read, dispelling one Pre-Columbian myth after another with ‚Äúnew‚Äù scientific evidence ‚Äì although much of it has been around for awhile but ignored ‚Äì as well as raising some fascinating if troubling questions. For instance ‚Äì if the New World was a more sophisticated, complex, densely populated place than we realized ‚Äì what the hell happened?

As alluded to above one of the fascinating features of this book is that much of the ‚Äúevidence‚Äù utilized to retool our history of the Pre-Columbian world has been around and has either been ignored or considered ‚Äúquirks‚Äù outside the boundaries of contemporary theory. My only fault with this book is that I got lost several times in some of the cultural details as well as the names of the ancient leaders/personages ‚Äì and there is a lot of both in this book.

27,1400032059,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1045774-mehrsa,4,"So much eye-opening research. I know that some of these findings are still being elaborated, but wow. So much devastation by disease, such large populations and complex civilizations. And the thesis at the end was so interesting: that it was Native American political structure that informed the founding fathers in creating our unique constitution that was based on liberty and equality. "
28,1400032059,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14046996-roy-lotz,3,"I should begin by saying that this book is not what I expected, which necessarily entails some disappointment. I was hoping for a more in-depth look at the major pre-Columbian societies and cultures. What this book instead offers is a sort of overview of trends in research in this area, highlighting how these trends contradict the popular image of the Americas before European colonization. This is, of course, also a valuable and worthwhile topic‚Äîand, considering the book‚Äôs popularity, many have found it to be so‚Äîbut I nevertheless must admit that, after putting down the book, I still have only a hazy notion of the actual cultures in question.Mann sets himself to undermine the popular notion of scattered groups of savages in a pristine, ahistorical paradise, living lightly off the land in a perfect harmony with nature. He sets out to show that, first, there were orders of magnitude more people in the Americas than was originally suspected; second, that humans arrived in the Americas far earlier than previously thought; and third, that pre-Colombian societies radically altered their environment. The picture that emerges is of a continent teeming with complex civilizations, each one manipulating the world around them in unique ways.Due to the limited and often indirect evidence available to researchers, and the comparatively nascent state of the field, Mann is unable to give a textbook-like overview of pre-Colombian societies. Our knowledge is simply too fragmentary; there are too many scholarly disagreements. He instead chooses to focus on individual scholars and their lines of research, showing how these converge to suggest the aforementioned new conclusions. The advantage to this method is that his narrative is enlivened with the stories of real research; and it also allows Mann to give a more realistic impression of the state of our knowledge. But the disadvantage is that this book often reads like an extended Nat Geo article‚Äîthe report of a journalist tagging along on research expeditions‚Äîrather than the bird‚Äôs-eye view I was hoping for.Another major drawback is that, by focusing on pioneering research, Mann is unable to give answers that are wholly satisfying, since the field itself has not yet reached a stable consensus. The research he relies on for his section on pre-Colombian population, for example, uses a combination of indirect evidence and simple speculation. Granted, I was convinced even before opening this book that European diseases caused significant depopulation after first contact. But whether the fatality rate was as high as 90%, as he suggests, is difficult to accept without more decisive evidence. Personally I find it hard to believe that one-fifth of the global population (to use his figure) could die off without leaving a far less ambiguous archeological trace. That the research is in this state is not, of course, Mann‚Äôs fault; yet he is not merely reporting the results of different experts in the field, but choosing those whose research most strongly supports this book‚Äôs thesis. This put me naturally on guard, since I know from my brief time studying archaeology how varied scholarly opinion can be in a field where evidence is necessarily scanty, incomplete, and suggestive. This being said, I do want to emphasize that I was convinced of Mann‚Äôs major points; it was only the details that put me in a dubious state of mind.Mann‚Äôs habit of focusing on the research that most forcefully bolsters his conclusions is part of a more general tendency to overstate his case. For example, I find it difficult to accept Mann‚Äôs assertion that the first generation of European colonists did not have a decisive military advantage over their American counterparts (which supports the thesis that disease was the decisive factor in the conquest). Steel blades, guns, and mounted cavalry were all landmarks in military technology in Eurasia, so I do not see why they would not lend an advantage in this context. I also could not swallow Mann‚Äôs argument that American Indian cultures played such a decisive role in the emergence of Western liberalism and individualism. Now, I have little doubt that the example of egalitarian, non-coercive societies did play a role in this development; but Mann makes it seem as if Locke, Montesquieu, and Voltaire were reliant on this example.But I should stop nitpicking a book which is thoughtful, well-written, well-researched, and which dispels many obsolete myths. And, really, it is my fault for choosing a book on new revelations, when I really wanted to learn more about the religion, art, architecture, and science of these vanished civilizations.(I should note one error I caught. Mann says that the Spanish missionary Gaspar de Carvajal was born ‚Äúin the Spanish town of Extremadura.‚Äù But Extremadura is region, or an autonomous community, not a town; Carvajal was born in Trujillo, which is indeed in Extremadura.)"
29,1400032059,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5229326-emma-deplores-goodreads-censorship,5,"This is an important book. The author compiles historical and archaeological research to provide a history of the Americas before (and shortly after) the arrival of Europeans. And it‚Äôs a legit history, in ways I didn‚Äôt realize were even lacking in my previous acquaintance with early American history before reading the book. Compared to most other parts of the world, we know relatively little about the early Americas, but there‚Äôs a lot more information available than is generally taught to the public, and so much of what we do know tends to be couched in these dismissive frameworks where native Americans are some sort of separate species of people, barbarians or noble savages or quasi-mythological beings, depending on your persuasion, all political structures consisting of ‚Äútribes‚Äù and their ‚Äúchiefs‚Äù no matter how large the groups or sophisticated their political organization, everyone ‚Äúliving lightly on the land‚Äù and ‚Äúin tune with nature‚Äù and so on. We know there were actual empires in Mexico and the Andes, and yet we reduce them to barbarians drinking out of skulls or performing human sacrifice (see: the worthless ‚Äúdocumentaries,‚Äù always shot at night in red and black, that my teachers showed in middle school). We don‚Äôt stop to ask about all the trappings of civilization that empires tend to have, or that cultures tend to develop on their way to becoming empires: what sort of political and economic systems did they have? What kinds of technology and writing systems were developed? What about poetry and philosophy? Who were the leaders, innovators and thinkers, and what were their ideas?Much of the achievement of this book, then, is writing a history of the Americas in the same way one writes a history of European or Asian cultures, and in fact, Mann uses numerous helpful comparisons between similar practices in different cultures, stripping away the mythology of native America that gets in the way of viewing people as people. It isn‚Äôt nearly as complete as histories about anywhere in Eurasia, and reading this book drives home the magnitude of how much history and culture has been lost, but there is a ton of information and detail here that I‚Äôd never encountered before. Some of Mann‚Äôs broad points no longer quite seem like ‚Äúnew revelations‚Äù: I think it‚Äôs fairly well-known among educated people at this point that the more hospitable parts of the Americas were heavily populated upon European arrival, then overwhelmingly reduced by disease. But other theses were still new to me: the extent of the land management carried out throughout North and South America, for instance, from regular burning of forests to maintain a particular ecological balance, to the Mayan engineering of potable water by paving over toxic elements in the Yucatan‚Äôs swamps with limestone, to the human-created fertile soil in the Amazon that now covers between a few thousand square miles and 10% of the basin, depending on whose estimates you believe.So I found this to be a really fascinating, enlightening book, told in an engaging style, though I do have a few caveats. The book spends a lot of time on drama amongst scientists, which at first I found out of place, though by the end I realized the importance of including it: our learning about history is by no means finished, and readers who know how the sausage is made are perhaps better qualified to analyze scientific differences of opinion in the future. The book also jumps around a fair bit, organized by very broad topics and then returning to discuss the same cultures in different segments; it‚Äôs best read when you have time to engage with it and flip back to earlier sections to refresh your memory. The section on the Amazon seems less complete and persuasive than the others. And the author‚Äôs obvious desire to turn the information in this book into an ecological lesson, or some kind of rebuke to the environmental movement (hah! The Americas were never pristine after all!) seems forced and unhelpful: the fact that native Americans engaged in more active stewardship and cultivation than previously supposed doesn‚Äôt make the idea of destroying everything for temporary economic gain any better. But this is a small part of the book, perhaps tacked on because the author felt like he was supposed to impart a lesson.Overall though, I think this is a fantastic book despite those few caveats, because it is so eye-opening, a great, accessible source of information that will probably be new to most of its readers, and because it represents a shift in popular thought about North and South American history. It is thorough, well-sourced and engaging, and I definitely recommend it."
30,1400032059,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6401606-goldgato,5,"Fantastic. Non-fiction books of 500+ pages usually make me antsy but this terrific re-rendering of New World history had me glued to the pages. I learned so much that it was, for me, quite mind-boggling.Maize is terribly promiscuous.Northern America, Central America, and South America all had tremendous histories of advanced cultures before Europeans ever knew about these lands. But whereas there was knowledge of the Aztecs, Mayans, and Incas, this book goes even further to explore the many different varieties of communities and civilizations that were unknown. There is an entire chapter on maize and its ability to feed huge cities, for instance, with water conscious efforts in play long before anyone heard of Climate Change.Alas for us, the Spanish invaders destroyed most written documents of the peoples they conquered, so we'll never know everything. Even in the 21st-Century, we are still learning about new cities and buildings long since hidden by the jungle. And then there was the massive wave of death that destroyed most communities as the Europeans and their accompanying germs/viruses moved throughout the land. Heartbreaking. The idea that the New World was simply one vast forest or plain with no inhabitants is forever torn apart with the outstanding research from the author and his team.Along with all the facts and minutiae, Charles Mann also turns a phrase here and there to describe a point. Here is his description of Peru:Peru is the cow-catcher on the train of continental drift. Leading South America's slow, grinding march toward Australia, its coastline hits the ocean floor and crumples up like a carpet shoved into a chair-leg.And there is also a big warning for humans and our manipulation of the land. We have long exceeded the environmental limitation of culture, something the pre-Columbian New World societies already knew about.This is easily one of the best and most cohesive histories I've ever read.Book Season = Year Round (not forever on earth)"

The first half was dull and tedious and didn‚Äôt tell me anything I hadn‚Äôt heard before. The second half, when it got to the details of the Mesoamerican and South American cultures was much more interesting. Thus, I found the organization irritating. The writing is readable, especially the small details which added up to a nice big picture. The content was both irritating and interesting. The cultures themselves were interesting. The science parts discussing history, theory and debates far less so. I‚Äôd heard most of it before in other books. At least the author is a journalist and not a scientist peddling his own pet theory. So, I was disappointed by about half the book and enjoyed the rest. So, I give this a 3. It‚Äôs halfway interesting and halfway readable. Might be better as an introduction to someone interesting but who hasn‚Äôt read about the science in other books.  "
33,1400032059,http://goodreads.com/user/show/267189-todd-n,4,"I was blown away by the Terry Gross interview with the author about his other book, 1493. (Earthworms went extinct in North America during the Ice Age???) So I figured I should start with 1491 and get the full pre-Columbian experience.I was engrossed by this book to the point where my Kindle 2's failing battery became an issue. (I wound up installing an aftermarket battery, which instantly increased my quality of life by 15%)The main thing I learned from this book is that anthropologists are mainly jerks. Their careers seem to go like this: Young anthropologist comes up with theory Y and is attacked by older anthropologists that came up with theory X. Eventually theory Y becomes accepted and they spend the rest of their careers in mainstream academia attacking theory Z proposed by younger anthropologists. And so on.The only thing capable of uniting anthropologists is their shared hatred of amateur anthropologists with their own theories, usually based on common sense and some weird thing found on their farm land.These anthropologists are really an unscientific lot. They seem to actually believe that since nothing older than Clovis settlements were found, nothing older than Clovis is possible. One anthropologist casually suggests that another one could benefit from therapy.It reminded me of a line from a book, maybe by David Lodge, that went something like ""the battles are so fierce because the stakes are so low."" (This is a good general purpose insult that you are welcome to, by the way.)But the thing is that the stakes couldn't be higher. At issue is the very core of the creation myths of USA and all the other countries on two continents. Mr Mann even makes a tantalizing case that the founding fathers were influenced by a confederation of Indian nations as they drafted the Constitution. (Try running that one by one of the Republican candidates, even that fat one that was a history professor.)Also, my son checked out a book about ""Squanto"" at the library for Thanksgiving this week, and it's presence in my house made me uncomfortable. But then again I wasn't quite sure how to explain the 1491 version to an 8-year-old. One example: The whole corn-in-the-fish thing was probably picked up when ""Squanto"" was captured and taken to Europe.The most important thing I learned from 1491, which seems sort of ""duh"" obvious, is that the Indians were their own agents during the post-Columbian period. They weren't passively getting colonized, nor where they innocents. After the initial shock of the meeting, they were making the best deals and the best alliances that they could under very difficult circumstances.It wasn't until disease (from a group of pigs in the Midwest, and some sailors in New England) wiped out about 95% of the native population that the Europeans were able to even think about starting colonies. Before that they were barely tolerated trading partners.They had a civilization that was more advanced in a lot of ways than Europe was at the time, a point the book makes repeatedly until my eyes glazed over. I couldn't keep track of all the civilizations and inventions after a while. The main genius of the Indians seemed to be in agriculture and nutrition. In fact, the Indians were amazed at how short and smelly the Europeans were, something that persists to this day.This is a book that needs to be read twice, though I don't have the time or patience for that. It's most definitely worth reading once."
34,1400032059,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1725471-gordon,5,"Every now and again a book comes along that fundamentally changes my perspective about something big, and this is one of them. There¬¥s a reason why the Pilgrims arrived at Plymouth Rock in Massachusetts in 1620 and found the forests nicely felled, the fields already cleared, and caches of food ready to be stolen. The reason: a huge population of Indians had already done the work on their behalf. The reason why hardly any of them were left is that the local population had been reduced a few short years before by a European-introduced epidemic that killed 95% of them.Take this story and multiply it many times over, and you have the story of contact between Europeans and Indians everywhere in the New World. In fact, as the author points out, it may not even be appropriate to call it the ""new"" world. It seems that the invention of the Neolithic revolution (think farming and villages) had been independently replicated at least twice in the Americas (Central America and the Andes), and at about the same time as it occurred in Mesopotamia. And it also seems that the population of the Americas was probably at least as great if not greater than that of Europe. So, it becomes pretty hard to say which was the new and which was the old world.The author spent years interviewing the scientists uncovering this kind of data and these kinds of new interpretations, and distills the points of view of various schools of thought at odds with one another. Example: Is the Amazon rain forest a wilderness, or is it in fact just the remnant of a forest that had been heavily shaped by millenia of agriculture by the Indians?Since I learned most of what I know about the early history of the Americas back in elementary school in Montreal and in high school in Ottawa several decades ago, I discovered that much of what I knew was, uh, dated. Or to be more accurate, wrong.This book is highly recommended."

36,1400032059,http://goodreads.com/user/show/541343-kenny,4,"As a result of decades of revisionist history (as well as flat-out incorrect but sincere assumptions by scientists), most people have come to see pre-Columbian America as an Edenic wilderness inhabited by pure-hearted indigenous folk living lightly on the land, leaving nary a footprint outside their biodegradable sweatlodges.Yet Mann shows us a densely populated, fiercely impacted hemisphere where no one was indigenous (they all came from somewhere else), much of the land repeatedly went up in smoke in a slash-and-burn regime designed to remake it for man, plants, and animals alike (a good portion of the Amazon rainforest itself is said to be the result of human intervention, planting, and control over millenia), sculpted in incredibly huge and aggressive ways (terrace farming in Peru, the literal creation of the Great Plains in north America by the ""Indians,"" giant figures carved into the dirt seen in their complete form only from the air in the Andes), with vast, heavy-handed populations (many ancient cities in the Americas were not only contemporaneous with those in Europe, they were larger, cleaner, and better managed).The result is that Columbus brought steel and smallpox to the Americas, decimating the local populations through war and disease, which perhaps wiped out as much as 90% of the entire human population of the hemisphere in just a few years. Columbus' men received syphillis in return, and cannot be blamed for the smallpox (no one even knew how disease was transmitted back then). They can also be excused from attempting to dominate the local cultures. After all, that is what the Inka, Maya, Olmec, and a score of other civilizations Mann discusses in the book had been doing to each other for nigh onto 10,000 years. The only difference is that we have the history of the conquest (thanks to the Spaniards themselves), not just a few worn sandstone steles covered in vines to place the popular blame on the Euro-conquerors.What happened in the Americas happened everywhere else in the world by people no different from those they found in the western hemisphere. Thus it has always been and likely thus it will always be. "
37,1400032059,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25147317-fred-sphere,5,"Very interesting and nearly always enjoyable. Mann builds on the Guns Germs & Steel thesis, and adds descriptions of the widely varied cultures of Pre-Columbian America.Mann, summarizing and popularizing the latest archeological and anthropological work, concludes that the American population in 1491 really was in the tens of millions, with complex and (mostly) very sophisticated societies with dense populations filling places like Mesoamerica and the Amazon basin. Mann states the emerging consensus shows the introduction of disease by European explorers and conquistadors unwittingly brought on the greatest human disaster in history: perhaps 20% of the world population died over a couple of centuries. If true, the loss to all humanity is a staggering tragedy, and also leads to the common mistake of viewing Americans as innocent, childlike nomads and hunter-gatherers.Yes, Americans never put the wheel to any practical use. But they were responsible, for example, for independently developing several systems of writing, and in agriculture they were second to none. Mann describes the cultivation of maize as an astonishing act of slo-mo genetic modification. As no close relative of maize now exists in the wild, it's hard to imagine how they did it.Americans are described as enthusiastic cultivators not just of artificial crops, but artificial landscapes as well. In yet another controversial conclusion, Mann describes how vast tracts of land in both the North American east and South America's Amazon were transformed into gardens for the optimization of desirable animals (in the north) and plants (like nut-bearing trees in the Amazon). Fire was the usual tool for terraforming.It's not just the underbrush that goes up in the smoke of the yearly burnoffs. Many fictions, polite or impolite, regarding the Americans as saintly or savage simpletons are incinerated by the facts Mann has marshaled. As we piece together a clearer picture of what these people were up to, they begin to appear to be exactly what they were: ordinary humans doing ordinary human activities with ordinary amounts of human wisdom in pursuit of ordinary human ambitions. "
38,1400032059,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1184083-paige,5,"This book is a fascinating window into the cultures of the Americas before the arrival of Columbus. Author Charles Mann, an award-winning writer for Science and The Atlantic Monthly, debunks many widely held notions about the inhabitants of the Western Hemisphere. With a contagious excitement, Mann shares recent discoveries of archeologists, historians and geographers, many of which up-end previously accepted beliefs. Mann presents new research showing that the population numbers of America‚Äôs First Nations were vastly underestimated. Many tribes were decimated by smallpox and other diseases shortly before Columbus arrived. Rather than living nomadic lives in a pristine wilderness, many early Native Americans built and resided in some of the world‚Äôs biggest and most opulent cities. For example, early societies in Bolivia created rich artificial environments with vast geometrical earthworks, manmade causeways and canals, moats and palisades. Amazon residents practiced sophisticated crop engineering.He also brings to light research showing that the tribes of what is now the Northeast U.S. had a politically sophisticated confederation governed by democratic principles. Another widely held belief ‚Äì that early inhabitants of the Americas arrived by crossing the Bering Strait land bridge from Siberia to Alaska ‚Äì is also held up for scrutiny because of new evidence of early human habitation in Chile.Mann brings to light a vast body of research from diverse fields, but does so in a style that is quite readable. As a science writer, he is careful to present opposing arguments on controversial topics, but paints a compelling picture of the early Americas as being more sophisticated and more widely settled than we had previously imagined."
39,1400032059,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24011982-cynda,3,"Charles C Mann attempts to publish information not widely available before, such as higher population counts of the natives of the New World than previously considered. Mann admits he is no professional historian. He respects his readers may giving them explanations and appendices. All his respect made his writing a bit tedious. Dare to make an argument and to be corrected by further research. I could tell Mann is more than an amateur and less than a professional historian because1. He uses phrases that are less clear and more idiomatic, such as ""I call Cahokia a city as to have a stick to beat it with, but it was not a city in any modern sense"" (Pg 259).2. Knopf (the publisher) publishes books less serious than the university presses.Mann writes an important book, one that explains populations, that explains how the natives altered the ecosystem for their benefit, that explains the over-abundance of bison bison and more."
40,1400032059,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4272181-micyukcha,4,"What an interesting and provocative book. It is through and through a history book, recording findings and dates, but the moral backdrop and the unsaid 'what if' make it something more.Without spoiling too much, the book goes against the Noble Savage notion and instead listens (not affirms) to archaeological, geographical, linguistic evidence and belief to the contrary. A very agnostic book, it explores evidence that shows the Native Americans/Indians were a populous people before 1491. They not only lived off the land but indeed shaped it. They had large cities, cultivated crops and mastered ecosystems.This seemingly small fork in the road does a number of what you might think of the impact of European ""discovery"" might be. Eg, the ""discovery"" killed a lot of humans (even more than you thought or were told in high school American history), it removed culture (not brought it) and it will change how you see ""save Planet Earth"" or ""protect the Amazon rainforest"".If you knew the Americas weren‚Äôt some virgin raw land, but rather, what if it was a cultivated land that supported as many people as Europe? That those people who were here before Columbus had civilization, cities, governments, representation, ruling by consensus, kings, diplomacy, book keeping systems, a unique concept of time and other forms of culture that made America truly a different world. Even the ‚Äúnatural‚Äù woods and wildlife parts, those parts that the English, Spanish, Dutch, French and Portuguese wrote about as ‚Äúnatural‚Äù discoveries, would not be so.There are so many detailed tidbits about locations, dates and people I can't possibly recall in the long future but the big takes I have from the book are: 1) how far back the history of the Native Americans/Indians goes (essentially a cradle of pre-civilization) and 2) how the Mesoamerican way of life, which was so radically different from other early civilizations (eg skipping traditional agriculture, different definitions of personal property and liberty) might've produced a totally different perspective and philosophy today is something the world has lost due to smallpox and other horrible things. That's sad. But good book."
41,1400032059,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8079403-max,4,"Mann highlights recent findings about pre-Columbian Indian cultures that undercut popularized perceptions. The Indians were far more numerous, more structured and more sophisticated than commonly thought. They had highly developed agriculture, commerce and social organizations. They significantly impacted their environments which they shaped to their needs. Thus the concept that the New World was unspoiled prior to Columbus is mistaken. The Americas had been teeming with people prior to contact with Europeans whose diseases decimated the Indians. When the Pilgrims landed at Plymouth in 1620 one of the first people they met was an Indian who spoke perfect English. He had been captured by a British trading ship and taken to Europe to be sold as a slave ultimately to escape and return home. He taught the Pilgrims how to use fish for fertilizer, ironically, a technique he had learned in Europe. Mann points out British ships had been active along the New England Coast for 100 years before the Pilgrims arrived. The English sporadically captured and killed the local Indians who had never allowed them to stay. Why then were the Pilgrims welcomed? 90% of the local Indians had died from diseases acquired from earlier European contact. The Pilgrims settled in one of their abandoned villages. In their weakened state these coastal Indians bargained with the Pilgrims for help against their inland enemies. Prior to the epidemic European traders had reported the New England coast was densely packed with Indians. Mann‚Äôs underlying point with this story applies to most of the history we read of the early settlers. The Indians they met were far different than those before Columbus. Their accounts of the Indians lead us into false assumptions about pre-Columbian Indian cultures. Indian societies had been shattered from the very first meetings with Europeans. Since the Indians lacked immunity to European diseases, devastating epidemics had spread rapidly across the Americas in advance of most settlers.Disease was responsible for the Inca‚Äôs destruction at the hands of Pissarro. Smallpox had spread to the Incas from Indian contact with Spaniards in Mexico taking out most of the population including the emperor and military leaders. The survivors fell into destabilizing infighting to see who would take over. Thus Pissarro faced a gravely weakened foe. Cortez‚Äôs destruction of the Aztecs was due to epidemic disease and the help of the Aztecs enemies who now found their foe vulnerable. Desoto‚Äôs tromp through the American South started pandemics that devastated the Indians. A century later the next explorers found scattered nomadic hunters in the place of the numerous Indian cities and villages reported by De Soto. Disease and factionalism doomed the Indians more than superior weapons on the part of Europeans. Much was lost about who these people were. Mann gives us an updated portrait of the pre-Columbian Indians. They created complex agricultural systems to support magnificent cities and rich cultures. The Indians developed many varieties of maize, their staple, through extensive crossbreeding. They cultivated squash, tomatoes, beans, potatoes, manioc, peanuts, cotton and tobacco. The Indians developed writing, mathematics including the concept of zero and unique calendars. That they never made use of the wheel even for pottery, water power or irrigation much less for transportation is a mystery for people so advanced in other respects.The first major culture in Mesoamerica was the Olmec starting around 1500 BC giving way to the Mayan around 400 AD until its collapse in the 9th century AD. What made these pre‚ÄìColumbian cultures rise and collapse? Constant warfare which the author compares to the early Greek states was significant. But fundamental to Mann was that their agricultural systems ultimately failed. Mayan cities grew large, with dense populations dependent on good harvests. In the end, too many trees were cut, too much land was washed away and when drought or difficult conditions hit, the land could not support the people. Mann offers a similar scenario for Cahokia, the largest Indian city north of the Rio Grande near present day St. Louis. This home of the Mississippian culture thrived from the 7th century until its decline in the 12th. Depletion of resources including wholesale deforestation and resultant devastating floods led to the civilization‚Äôs collapse. Indians regularly used fire to shape their environment altering the natural distribution of species. The New World Columbus found was not a pristine wilderness and the Indians were not sentimental caretakers. The land had been exploited for centuries by large populations. The thick forests most North American frontiersmen encountered and the huge herds of buffalo and flocks of pigeons did not exist in 1491. De Soto had seen Indians everywhere but no bison. With the demise of large Indian populations that culled them, the buffalo, pigeons and other species proliferated. The very first settlers could ride wagons through the forests because the Indians had regularly burned away the underbrush. With most of the Indians gone, the underbrush grew out and forests became the untamed ones later settlers wrote about. Invasive plants from Europe spread faster than the Europeans. The bluegrass frontier people found in Kentucky actually had simply outraced the settlers from the East Coast. It had been brought over from Europe. Even the Amazon wilderness had been reshaped by the Indians. Many areas had been densely populated. The Indians purposely enriched the soil to grow crops and propagated their favorite fruit trees. Amazon cultures had largely disappeared due to European diseases before any but a handful of Europeans saw them. What most Europeans saw were the remnants that escaped the epidemics into the jungle living hand to mouth looking like the savages the Europeans expected to find. Thus even this so called primeval forest was no such thing. Its natural abundance of fruit was not natural at all but the result of centuries of human intervention. Mann transformed my views of the pre-Columbian Indians and their land. While I am sure in another few years the ‚Äúfacts‚Äù will change again, any idea I had of a pristine Eden inhabited by humans living in harmony with nature is gone. Not that Mann is unkind in his treatment of the Indians. To the contrary he extolls their accomplishments. But any mystical aura has been shattered. All of humankind seems very much alike. "

What I especially liked about the writing is the summation of the historical research regarding this. Theories that rose and later rejected up to the current discussion. It is also evident that he is doing his best to be fair and to present dissenting opinions, making this a richer book.What I enjoyed learning was how different technologies were used. That you can't judge a culture just by comparing technology levels. That often a differing emphasis will create differing technologies. That there is a blindside when it comes to this. One statement from the book I remember is that you can't find what you are not looking for.No doubt that there is so much mor to learn about this period and their peoples and that theories will continue to rise and fall."

Alas, it is only some of the terms Charles Mann digs up discussing pre-Columbian agriculture. (Digs up, get it? Never mind.)I‚Äôve done my share of wandering the Yucatan. Unlike the civilizations of Rome or Egypt, you just know there is a much more profound mystery surrounding the Maya, Inca and even the North American cultures pre-invasion. Vast cities, astounding architecture, math, astrology and human sacrifice‚Äîwhat more could you ask for? Unfortunately what we know is filtered through the eyes and attitude of European xenophobia.This treatise is designed to change the idea that the Americas before Columbus was a vast wilderness populated by inconsequential natives easily ignored. In fact, when ‚Äòthe Italian from Spain‚Äô did show up, the population was equal if not greater than that of Europe‚Äîperhaps in the tens of millions.The scope is vast, the research detailed‚Äîcombining recent sociological statistics with legend and scholarship from an array of sources. This is the first ‚Äòchunk‚Äô of information I have read on the civilizations of the Mississippi flood plain and how the massive earth mounds correlate, in a way, to the Anasazi. Very interesting. The author also goes into detail on the cat-fights emanating from other experts in the field‚Äîa little like Jared Diamonds ‚ÄúCollapse.‚ÄùMann takes into account the immense sweep of geological time and the empires that have come and gone in only a span of twenty millennia and the seemingly abrupt changes that have occurred to so many. There are fascinating tales of places like the great Inca city of Tenochtitlan‚Äîin its heyday, it was larger than Paris‚Äîand Tawantinsuyu on the shore of Lake Titicaca in the high Andes, a marvel of architecture and economic prosperity.His prose is concise but sometimes overly technical. As he connects the dots of cultural myths between the Colorado Plateau (particularly the Hopi) and those of Central Peru some amazing revelations emerge.

44,1400032059,http://goodreads.com/user/show/930189-avis-black,1,"I lost patience with this book with the section entitled Holmberg's Mistake. Charles Mann's contention is that the native indians of the Beni, an area in Bolivia, deliberately created a surprisingly complex region of plant biodiversitiy. So far, so good. Then Mann complains about the anthropological work of Allan Holmberg, conducted in the 1940s. Holmberg, in his ethnography Nomads of the Longbow, portrayed the indians of the Beni as being, in essense, a bunch of feckless losers. Since the indians of Holmberg's day were obviously not as impressive as those talented farmers many hundreds of years ago, this bothers Mann very much, and anyway, Mann says the indians of the 1940s weren't even the descendants of those earlier people, but a bunch of later interlopers. Mann labels this Holmberg's Mistake, and lays out the contention that Holmberg's portrayal is not valid. It's at this point that Mann lost me. How is Holmberg's work a mistake? How is his book invalid? Holmberg wasn't trying to create a picture of the earlier indians, but describing the people he saw during his period of research. Mann makes me think of a social worker charged with the investigation of a report of child abuse, who, upon entering the household, sees a kid with two black eyes and parent with a bloody fist. The social worker then turns to the wall and sees a picture of the house's owners two generations ago, looking spruce in nice clothes. The social worker then says, ""The people who used to live here look very respectable. Therefore, what I'm seeing now can't be valid. No problem here, have a nice day."" And that's why I quit reading the book. Mann is a member of the Doily-on-the-Furniture School of Anthropology. Their modus opperandi for conducting intellectual warfare is: If you don't like it, dress it up, create misdirection, or cover it up, but for God's sake, don't admit unpleasantness exists because denial feels so much better."

Too many points to enumerate here, but it will completely shift your frames of reference and alter the lenses with which you view this history.That said, I will say that about the first third or so, I found it hard to remain consistently interested. There is overwhelming detail about individuals, battles, etc. of the different pre-Columbian civilizations, and sometimes far too much detail concerning agriculture or specific food items. I think some of this may have been more engaging for me if I had read it in print form, with maps, genealogies, etc., like we typically have in history books.Sometimes for the uninformed it's hard to know which ideas are truly accepted, and which are really from the fringe. The author does a good job of presenting the different sides to the theories at times, but not always. Additionally, there's a large part of me that finds it difficult to absorb and truly believe what seem like fairly grandiose stories derived solely from archaeological digs.

This book is a nice counterbalance to all the racism and woolly-headed romanticism about the unspoiled Eden that supposedly greeted the first European explorers. There‚Äôs a lot of controversial stuff in here because so many people hold such deeply held beliefs about these things and don‚Äôt want to give them up.I think it makes sense that during their thousands of years here, the inhabitants of the Americas made a much bigger impact on the landscape then we give them credit for. When Columbus‚Äôs ships first landed in the Bahamas, it was not a meeting of an old world and a new world, it was the meeting of two old worlds, a mixing of two long-separated realms, the consequences of which we are still dealing with to this day.This book also does a nice job of calling to our attention the debt that world civilization owes to the first peoples of the Americas, from a number of important food crops to the very concept of individual liberty. It also brings to our attention the massive missed opportunity that European diseases and racism brought about. How much more could the pre-Columbian civilizations of North and South America have contributed to the modern world were it not for those things? We will never know.There‚Äôs so much information in this book, that it kind of dragged in places, but considering its importance, I won‚Äôt complain too much.I look forward to the sequel, 1493, which will, no doubt, pick up where this book left off."

Sounds pretty dry right? What he produced is mind blowing, and for two reasons. Firstly because the facts themselves are both nearly unbelievable and exhaustively supported. Secondly because the facts bare almost no resemblance to anything I learned about the subject in school.I‚Äôll relate the basics of a few of the most incredible ones.The populations of Native North Americans that European colonists interacted with were the survivors of a continent-wide holocaust that wiped out 90-95% of their population. Smallpox spread through the interior of the content faster than Europeans explored it, leaving empty civilizations in its wake. One of the reasons there wasn‚Äôt a permanent European settlement on the eastern seaboard until over 100 years after Columbus is that until that point, the coast was too crowded with people already living there. The colonists set up in the ruins of towns that were entirely wiped out by disease. Squanto (Tisquantum) the Indian who school children will be hearing about a lot in the next week, attached himself to the Plymoth colony only after escaping from captivity in Europe and returning to his home to find everyone dead. The same plague swept through Meso- and South America, but the Spanish explored faster, so we know more about the civilizations that lived there.Native North Americans are described as hunter gatherers, because that‚Äôs what people revert to after civilization collapses. When their cultures were intact, the land of entire eastern US was intensely managed by them through a combination of direct agriculture, regular burning to clear underbrush and encourage game species normally found in the plains to spread into the woodland, and selective planting. At least 10% of the Amazon Rainforest was planted by the people who lived there. Rather than clearing land for agriculture, they created forest gardens, and this arboreal agriculture supported large complex civilizations that we know almost nothing about.There are giant causeways made of earth and full of shards of pottery spreading through miles of flood plain in the Beni in Bolivia. They were only discovered in the 1960s. There was evidently a large civilization living there that we know nothing about. That‚Äôs the level of discovery that‚Äôs still possible in this subject: advanced civilizations that are new to science.Ultimately, the thing that affected me the most that I will remember forever is the idea of ‚Äúearth as garden.‚Äù Mankind has changed irrevocably every land it has settled. Even in the Americas, traditionally thought of as a nearly untouched wilderness until Europeans arrived, was intensely modified and cultivated by the people who lived there. Much of what today we think of as wilderness was in its time planted deliberately by people. The ethics of environmentalism constantly stumble over defining what ‚Äúnatural‚Äù is. I propose that there is no such thing. The whole earth is a garden. It‚Äôs enough to try to keep it that way."
50,1400032059,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4828849-michael-burnam-fink,5,"Most of us have the same hazy ideas of Indians that have been drilled into us from preschool: Small bands of hunter-gathers, living lightly on an edenic pristine wilderness. Mann ably summarizes the past fifty years of archaeological scholarship to show that this picture is wrong in every particular. Pre-contact Indians were largely agrarian, settled in cities as big as any in Europe, had a rich religious tradition that left massive monumental sites, and conducted wars and politics with hegemonic fury. They met the initial groups of European explorers as equals and more than equals, despite their lack of metal tools or domesticated animals. A century later, they were almost all dead, taken by waves of disease that may have had mortality rates of over 95%. Think of a room of 20 people. Now think of a room with 19 corpses and one survivor. The Indian of popular imagination is a post-apocalyptic survivor, living in an landscape of ecological collapse where previously marginal species like buffalo and the passenger pigeon spread like wild.The status of the Indian is a political hot potato, since every American state rests on an initial act of massive genocide. The idea of a continent untouched by human hands is fundamental to modern environmentalism. Mann speaks clearly and deliberately to these ends. The exact arrival of Indians to the Americans is uncertain. The Clovis culture of 12000 years ago is well documented, but they may not have been the first. Indian civilizations changed the land deliberately, creating a continent wide-orchard. They also suffered their own ecological collapses, particularly the Maya and the Cahokia mound builders seem to have had political systems that fractured under environmental strains. The Amazon river basis may have supported a flourishing urban culture that succumbed to the same waves of epidemics.Any book with ambitions as grand as a complete history of the Indian people is bound to be incomplete. Mann lavishes chapters on the uniqueness of domesticated maize, but leaves its actual domestication a mystery. Comparisons to familiar examples from European history are sometimes useful, and sometimes miss the mark. The pueblo cultures of the American southwest are unfortunately slighted, along with the Pacific Northwest. And as always, some of the most interesting cultures left behind nothing in the way of written records, either from a lack of an alphabet, or deliberate destruction by colonizers. Still, Mann has provide a precious counter to popular understanding, and a view of the cultures of 1491 as active participants in their own destiny, soon to be struck down by a fluke of biology rather than any innate flaw."
51,1400032059,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75748905-elizabeth,4,"1491 by Charles Mann is a celebration of a vibrant, sophisticated culture that has largely been overlooked in classrooms, textbooks, and public knowledge. In a pithy footnote, Mann says:
‚ÄúNative American history merits more than nine pages.‚Äù
So much of how society sees Native Americans is mired with misunderstanding, and this book has opened my eyes to how much I didn‚Äôt know about their rich history. Yes, I was taught in grade school about the different tribes that populated the Americas (and we‚Äôre all familiar with the stories of Pocahontas or Squanto and the Pilgrims, stories which have been taught without their deserved complexity and insight), but the degree to which we glossed over just how advanced these varied civilizations were is just shocking. I just think about the attention that the places like Mesopotamia, Egypt, China, and Greece receive when the Incan civilization was bigger than Ming Dynasty China or any European state in 1491.Mann acknowledges that over time there have been political reasons that have shaped the narrative of Native Americans, once savages to a people cruelly ravaged by the arrival of Europeans. What I truly appreciate is how Mann emphasizes that this ideological tug-of-war has failed to address the way the world has stripped these people of agency‚Äîand in doing so, their history. It is at once saddening and awe-inspiring to get a glimpse at the sheer assortment of people living in the Americas before Europeans arrived. Though much has been lost through the lack of recorded history, archeologists, scholars, and anthropologists have reconstructed a history that shows Indians had their own array of political leaders, artisans, intellectuals, mathematicians, farmers, nomads, and everything in between. Just as with any great civilizations, they experienced war, political machinations, trade disputes, and the like. But it was that sweeping evil‚Äîdisease‚Äîthat played an undeniable role in erasing the stronghold of indigenous populations inhabiting the Americas. Despite this, 1491 provides unquestionable proof that the natives left an indelible mark on the continent. It is easy to think that what we do not see does not exist, but by god, we should never settle for that. We should never subject a diverse people to a one-dimensional, facile stereotype in the dominating presence of Western ethnocentrism, and the Native American people are one of many that deserve the thoughtful, respectful attention which their history warrants. Mann‚Äôs 1491 does just that with a truly enlightening, comprehensive history of the Americas before the colonization of the Europeans."
52,1400032059,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2119128-relstuart,4,"Popular history has been that America before Columbus was sparsely populated with the tribes here living in harmony with nature with little impact on the land. Archeology in the last several decades has raised significant challenges to this view. There is evidence that the population was much higher than previously thought and that many tribes had significant impact on the land around them through farming, building, or other means. Particularly in the Central and South America we have evidence of large cities and societies that in some ways rivaled or exceeded those on the other side of the Atlantic.  These societies fell through warfare or many right before European based exploration, evidence seems to suggest plague and disease removed huge swathes of the Native American population. Scientists theorize that germs from the first few Europeans spread through the land much faster than the Europeans did and that is why when they arrives there was lots of open uninhabited land for them to move into. The chapter on re-examining some of the animal populations and our ideas about them was interesting. The carrier pigeons and the Buffalo were two species that at one time had millions upon millions of members roaming in North America. Now the carrier is extinct and the Buffalo reduced far below its previous millions. While there is plenty of evidence of Indians eating the Buffalo there is little evidence of them eating the carrier pigeon which seems to indicate a fowl population way out of sync with its former numbers leading to its extinction. The buffalo seems to also have a lesser role in some tribes than initially thought as some tribes farmed and had established cities and depended much less on a nomadic lifestyle following the buffalo. In sum, this book reviews some of the myths still commonly taught today about America before Columbus and looks at some of the information we now have and what this clearer history means. "

Mann, a Journalist preparation of known archeological and anthropological work form the last 80 years is a fascinating treatment of what the western hemisphere was like prior to the arrival of Columbus. It sheds new light on what most of us were taught in high school about the migration of native ancestors the American Indian crossing the Bering Strait 12,000 years ago and that America was a vast wilderness inhabited by small nomadic bands of natives. The book describes the vast empires of the Mayans, Inca and Aztecs and their development of irrigation, agriculture (to include genetic engineering with maize), and mathematics. For example cities‚Äìsuch as Tenochtitl√°n, the Aztec capital‚Äìwere far greater in population than any contemporary European city. Tenochtitl√°n, unlike any capital in Europe at that time, had running water, beautiful botanical gardens, and immaculately clean streets. Another fact brought to light was the earliest cities in the Western Hemisphere were thriving before the Egyptians built the great pyramids.Having spent time in Ecuador and the western most expanse of the Amazon, and touring the City of Teotihuacan near Mexico city and the Mayan ruins of Tulum and Costa Maya, as well as a fascination with the Indians of North America, Canada and Alaska, I found this book enthralling. I will certainly keep it as a permanent part of my library and plan to re-read it."

The fact that native Americans had large cities in Amazonia and elsewhere should really not surprise us, since there were large cities in other tropical areas, like Angkor Wat, but it is not the history most of us learned in school. It was also interesting to me that Anna Roosevelt, Theodore's grand-daughter played a key part in establishing that cities did exist in Amazonia, since I am endlessly fascinated by TR, and because he led an early, epic, and nearly fatal expedition to the Amazon. But once the main ideas have been laid down in the book, it drags, in my opinion. It seems the author was looking for ways to fill pages after a certain point, and this kind of writing where original points are repeated, perhaps amplified, but nothing new presented, wears me down. Hence the three star review, which is maybe a bit harsh, but honestly by the last third of the book I was simply waiting for it to end, even though the first half was relatively interesting."

The author's main points are that Native Americans were more sophisticated and more populous than Europeans have historically believed. Also, according to many researchers, the Americas were settled thousands of years earlier than previously thought. I have always been interested in learning more about Native American history, and the topics discussed in the book are intriguing. However, due to my unfamiliarity with Mesoamerican terminology, names, and the geography of central and South-America, I had trouble following the author. He would discuss several different cultures and time-frames in a single chapter in order to stay with his topic.

61,1400032059,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24373332-jacques-coulardeau,5,"A GENOCIDAL PANDEMIC TSUNAMIThat‚Äôs the book we had wanted to read for a very long time. It is absolutely needed in our attempt to understand what the Americas were before they became the Americas with Christopher Columbus sailing into them that he only thought were the West Indies, if not simply India per se. Our whole assessment of this New World before Columbus is based on what the conquistadors reported and what they wanted us to believe and it was altogether a big pack of many things that had nothing to do with what the Americas were before the arrival of the Europeans.The Europeans brought along, meatal weapons and tools, horses and pigs, and several epidemics that were lethal, fatal, deadly for the Indians, as the author explains, because of the Indians‚Äô particular genetic endowment concerning their immune system, their resistance, and reactivity to new germs. Not only had they never encountered smallpox, hepatitis A, and a few more, in their entire life on this earth and for many thousand years if not several ten thousand years, with apparently a genetic similarity with some native tribes from Siberia, but I will not take this as the answer to the mystery of this genetic handicap that became a deficiency, because the Indians did not react to a new germ by mobilizing their immune system and their natural defenses. They seemed to just close-down all access, lock up all doors, and in a way just let themselves be taken away by the various diseases. They may even have developed some kind of fatalism in front of this apparently inescapable and unavoidable cataclysm.From the very first contact on the first day, the germs were transmitted ‚Äì though of course, no one knew about it ‚Äì and the high level of Indian mobility at the time caused the germs to be transmitted over vast areas in a question of days and when the diseases came out after incubation, it was too late. Within a few weeks or months, the infested population was put to rest in proportions that we cannot even know, except that all signals and signs we can find on the ground ‚Äòarchaeological or cultural) indicate that the New World was densely populated before and that Indians lived in big urbanized units that were comparable to European cities as for their population. Estimations of fatalities vary between 50 and 90%. I would say they must have been very comparable to the Black Death in Europe in the 14th century: 50% of the population was eradicated by the plague, but over longer periods of time, over ten or twenty years. With Indians, we are speaking of the same level of casualties but in just a couple of months in each case.The author insists all along on the tremendous social, demographic, economic, political, and cultural catastrophe, a disaster for the whole continent. We cannot think that at first, the Europeans knew about this collateral effect after their arrival. But only at first, because very fast they seemed to have taken measures to compensate the collateral genocide that was thus unwillingly committed, and the Spaniards started importing Black slaves from Spain at first because they had had Black slaves in Spain for a few decades before Christopher Columbus crossing the Atlantic Ocean. And then they started importing them directly from Africa. The triangular Transatlantic slave trade was started. Then they must have known they were spreading diseases that existed in Europe, even if in Europe they were either limited to children with no real danger or to a small proportion of adults.The main argument here is that what at the time people told about the Americas and the Indians was nothing but the description of a devastated country, continent, devastated by a pandemic tsunami. The testimonies the Conquistadors could get from the survivors were the stories of people traumatized by the event trying, at times desperately, to survive under the forceful if not brutal military colonial domination imposed by Spain and Portugal. At best they must have been nostalgic. But if we want to be realistic they were hyper-traumatized by the turn of events that ‚Äúproved,‚Äù if it needed to be proved, that all they believed in before, gods, mythologies, religions, social contract, education, you name it you have it, was all wrong since their gods, among other spiritual forces, were given the absolute lie. How could they go on believing in the Maize God or the Sun God or whatever other God or Goddess, when it was so obvious all these gods just let them die in utter suffering and helplessness? After such an event, Post Traumatic Colonial Stress Syndrome, if not PT-Genocidal-SS, has to be the result. Could you believe what such traumatized people would say about what it was before the ‚ÄúFall‚Äù? The author calls this the Holmberg‚Äôs Mistake, the belief that what they saw when arriving was the reality of before. They saw a highly sophisticated society in absolute disruption, and thus they could not see the high sophistication that was the Indians‚Äô reality before this pandemic tsunami. So, they believed the New World was wild, savage, totally uncivilized, ^primeval for the ‚Äúromantic‚Äù thinkers like Montaigne or later Chateaubriand. They believed the disruption they saw was the natural state of this continent. Yet the author launches himself into a reconstruction of the past from what we can have at our disposal: archaeological finds and excavations, artifacts from before the colonization, all sorts of artifacts and objects, stories, mythologies that the memory of the survivors could provide. And then you have to enter into this book with care and slow reading because every word brings up a debate, every page requires a critical approach, every chapter is a mine of various minerals, all mixed-up and intertwined, obsidian, jade, and turquoise, or even gold and silver. The first thing you must do is sort out all the details and information and try to see things in an historical, what I call, with a few others, phylogenic perspective. I do not believe in retrospective reconstruction, and here it is difficult to ban that retrospective approach that is generally considered as narrowing the reality in my field of research, i.e. linguistics. So, we have to make do with it and try to compensate for the shortcoming of it with a good phylogenic approach that has to descend from the past to the present and not ascend from the present to the past. We have to wonder about what is potentially contained in what we have collected about the past, knowing that history will always only realize the potentials contained in the real situation, though of course, an event like Christopher Columbus can disrupt such potentials and their phylogeny. Yet I believe the potentials survive the catastrophe and it can come back into the picture several centuries later.But one more fundamental idea is to be set here. What is often called the Clovis First Theory, a speculative ideological construction I would at best call the Clovis First hypothesis, is debunked scientifically in this book, even if it is not completely eliminated or reduced to what it is, a minor hypothesis concerning the arrival of Homo Sapiens in the Americas. The Clovis First hypothesis states that all Native Americans arrived in the Americas as a whole from Siberia via Beringia after the peak of the Ice Age around 15,000 BC at the very most (some versions of this speculative approach do not go beyond 12,000 BC or even less). Clovis is in New Mexico, and some say it had a very short lifespan: ‚ÄúThey first appeared in America around 9,200 B.C. and vanished 500 years later, around 8,700 B.C.‚Äù (HowStuffWorks.com) Note the magical words ‚Äúappeared‚Äù and ‚Äúvanished,‚Äù as if it were some kind of prestidigitation act, from some supernatural power I guess. The doors that are still closed or only partly open are complex. First, some Homo Sapiens arrived long before the peak of the Ice Age (19,000 BC). At least three hypotheses about Homo Sapiens arriving in the Americas have to be taken into account. From Siberia, or lower south including Japan, but by ‚Äúboat‚Äù, hence arriving on the Canadian or Washington coast, south of the ice caps, and then going down the coast both by ‚Äúboat‚Äù or on foot. And that would have happened before 19,000 BC. The second hypothesis we have to keep in mind concerns Monte Verde in Chile that is being excavated and they have reached the layer around 20-25,000 BC. And there would be a third layer that would go beyond 30,000 BC. This brings up the idea that another migrating route must have existed in the southern Pacific. Apparently, DNA contacts have been traced with the Polynesians in the Marquesas Islands and other islands east of New Zealand. It is not clear when and if it is only from Chile to these islands or from these islands to Chile. Homo Sapiens reached Australia around 45,000 BC and New Zealand soon after though all archaeological artifacts about this old migration have been locked up by the New Zealand government for an unspecified length of time. These Australian Aborigines also reached Madagascar since the original native language is not African but is connected to the Australian Aborigines‚Äô language. So, they knew how to navigate long-distance on the Pacific Ocean, and we know it is tricky as all Polynesians who do it will tell you, agreeing as for that with the writer and sailor Joseph Conrad. There might also have been some connection with Africa, which would explain some Olmec carved giant heads that are typical of African face physiology, but also the migration of some plants from Africa to Latin America, among others tobacco. But the book insists, though maybe not clearly enough, on the existence of a split between a northern culture that imported maize and tobacco, for example, from the south (the case of Cahokia is fascinating), and southern culture centered on Amazonia as the devising area of the famous milpa agriculture and the terra preta soil, and the integration of ground charcoal in the soil, implying a ‚Äúslash-and-char‚Äù agriculture and rejecting the slash-and-burn agriculture to after the importation of metal axes and tools that only came with the Spaniards after Christophe Columbus. He insists too that this shift to steel tools enabled the rescue of Indian agriculture, though not in the best direction, by slash-and-burn because metal exes and tools enabled Indians to clear vast forest areas they could not clear before. He maybe should insist more on the fact that the food needs had tremendously decreased after the epidemics and that this slash-and-burn agriculture was more needed by the incoming colonizers who imported African slaves to do the work the Indians could not do since they were dying like flies, and I am sure they were nothing but parasites for the colonizers, human (if not beastlike) parasites, cultural parasites, religious parasites, in one word barbaric heretics. On these questions, this book is essential, even if it does not systematize this critical approach to devise a new way to develop these Americas by integrating Indians and Indian traditions. The recent (July 10, 2020) US Supreme Court decision on the five tribes in Arizona whose basic treaties with the Federal government were signed at the end of the 19th century, reasserting the full validity of these treaties is going the right way, even if there is a lot more work to do. And we remember the justice decision at the beginning of Obama‚Äôs first term in office granting reparation money to all Indian reservations. The re-emergence of Indian culture and Indian tribes is coming in the USA, just as much as in many South American and Mesoamerican countries (Mexico and the Maya train, Bolivia and their Indian president Evo Morales, and the struggles of Indians in Amazonia, particularly Brazil.You have understood I guess I consider this book as a turning point in the historical approach of the original reality of the Americas and American Indians. A turning point that reaches a point of no return: the question is not whether it is true or not. The question is how can we go further and understand what is emerging in this New World torn apart by the hegemonic role of the USA for centuries, a hegemonic role that is bursting at the seams of its suit due to the over-bloated (mentally and corporally) and over-fed (obese and probably diabetic) reality. Now I have given a general assessment, it is high time to consider some details, some specific elements, and there is a lot of food for thought there. That is the next task of all readers.Dr. Jacques COULARDEAU"

63,1400032059,http://goodreads.com/user/show/293178-caroline,5,"Rarely has a non-fiction book engrossed me so. This is an intensely interesting read, summarising cogently many decades of archaeological, anthropological, botanical, biological and historical debate.It is incredible to me that the age-old myth about the Americas as being a virtually empty 'pristine wilderness' is still promulgated: a land inhabited by tribes who lived so lightly on the land that they had no civilisations, no cities, none of the hallmarks of what we would call 'civilisation', people who had lived the same way for hundreds and thousands of years, with little change of evolution. As Mann argues in this book, almost every part of that statement is utterly wrong. And yet even today it is the myth that seems to have taken root. And to a large extent part of the reason that myth has been promulgated and believed is because it lets Europeans off the hook, so to speak - it makes Columbus and Cortes and the Pilgrim Fathers justified in retrospect, because if the land was empty, the argument went, it was okay to move in. Right?Except the land wasn't empty. Far from it. There is a great amount of evidence that shows that the Americas may once have been the most populated part of the globe. When Europe was still mostly an empty, ice-choked expanse, people were living in the Americas in cities, thousands of people, even millions. Thinks of the Maya, the Incas, the Aztecs. And what happened to them, that by the time of the European colonisation, the land was seen as empty?In this book Mann explores the impact of European diseases on the people of the Americas, and it's incredibly sobering to read. Scientists have estimated that the death tolls could have reached up to 95% of the population, that by the time Cortes and his man made their way through the Americas, the diseases they brought with them could have spread so far ahead that whole populations, whole civilisations could have been wiped out. It's hard to imagine. You can understand how any civilisation could collapse with such a catastrophic epidemic.He also argues that the pristine wilderness reported in so many early accounts was precisely a result of the wiping out of the native peoples. If you remove an apex predator, species lower on the food chain thrive. He argues that the reason early accounts report of immense herds of buffalo, massive flocks of passenger pigeon, was not because this was the way the continent had always been, but because this was Nature's reaction to the removal of these species' predators and competitors. So when ecologists talk about the damage colonisation did to the ecosystem, they may be harking back to something that never existed in the first place. The native peoples shaped the landscape around in much the same way we do now - perhaps with more of a long-term view and with more balance and stability - but they left their traces, just the same.I could not put this down. When textbooks talk about the ancient civilisations in China, Mesopotamia, Egypt, the Indus Valley, it seems criminal that they pass over Mesoamerica in just a few paragraphs. This should be required reading."
64,1400032059,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155693-alex,4,"What we think of when we think of the pre-Columbian Americas -- a wilderness lightly occupied by primitive tribes -- was in fact only the tiny remnants of a sophisticated and highly evolved society which had been ravaged by European disease, largely before Europeans could ever make contact with them.That is the provocative thesis of this thoughtful and thorough look at what existed in this hemisphere before 1491, and what happened to it in 1492. While it sounds like a tired politically correct, multi-culturalal revisionism, it isn't -- it's a fascinating and honest search for a clear-eyed history of the continent. It is also a sweeping, well-research chronicle of the macro elements that mold history --- in the spirit of Jared Diamond's ""Guns, Germs and Steel."" Not only will it change the way you look at America's history, but it will change your view of how history unfolds.Aside from the history of the various empires which existed in pre-Columbian America -- Mayans, Azteks, Incans, and many you've never heard of -- Mann also looks at the biology, technology, and anthropology behind the history. Among some interesting points he hits on are the development of corn (the first feat of genetic engineering, he claims), why Indians were so vulnerable to European germs (it's more complicated than you think), and how Indian culture influenced the development of the colonies and, he alleges, American ideas of freedom and democracy.Mann isn't an academic, and he largely is just collecting information that other scientists have uncovered. The purpose of the book is not to uncover new facts, but to gather them in a way they haven't before to show how the newest available research so vividly contradicts our ingrained ideas about how the Americas were settled.That said, Mann is sometimes a bit too zealous in pushing his case, occassionally making leaps in logic that aren't backed up with the evidence. He also could have spent more time dealing with some of the reactions non-academics would have reading the book. I had some fairly unsophisticated questions myself -- ""Hey, if the Indians were so well-developed, why weren't there any huge cities in the north?"" ""If they were so technological, why didn't they 'discover' Europe?""But the bottom line is, this book is a must for anyone interested in the world's history. Highly recommended."

The main thesis of the book is that pre-Columbian American societies were far more advanced and populous than recorded by European colonists/invaders/priests. The successive waves of epidemics brought by European contact decimated the Americas to such an extent that these societies caved into anarchy and ruin, which was seen as their original condition by the new arrivals.So far, nothing really new -- the interesting part is that the author believes that some of the weirder bits of natural history since the Conquest (passenger pigeon & American buffalo population explosions and extinctions, for example) are due to food chain gaps caused by the catastrophic human population drops in the 16th and 17th centuries. Sections about pre-Columbian human cultivation of the Amazon rainforests were fascinating.One star off for an overly simplistic view of 15th - 16th century European motives and actions, and for a patronizing & corny (heh heh) scene with a Mexican maize farmer.This book is very easy to read and digest, aimed at the general reader rather than the history nerd.

It was filled with so much interesting information, sprawling two entire continents, and (despite the title), centuries. Which led the book to be rather wandering at times (why it was so easy to put down and go days before picking it back up), but still, as soon as it was in my hands again, I was following people around, telling them stories from its pages.Mann spends a lot of time comparing American cultures to the more well studied civilizations of Europe, the Middle East, and sometimes China. A hard task given how little we still know about early American cultures compared to the others. But now ultimately the point. He makes a case briefly that part of what accelerated the development of Western civilization was the frequent cross-pollination of ideas from diverse cultures around the Mediterranean. What this book establishes for me is, how tragic the loss to modern humanity, that so few of the gifts of American civilization had time to pollinate anything at all before they were all but extinguished by disease and war. That, and the importance of a written language.Fascinating. So highly recommended. "

It was simply amazing! I wonder what the world would be like if Columbus never sailed or if Europeans waited to come to the Americas. This book gave a lot of details regarding what Europeans saw when they first came to an unvisited area. Cortez was simply amazed when he saw Tenochtitlan - the Aztec city had clean streets, cleaner than those in Spain! The Maya had created three different calendars - one of which is more precise than the calendar we use today. All these new cultures, all these new plants and animals, all these new ideas.

I sometimes felt like I was reading a textbook, and while I may not necessarily mind that sometimes, it is definitely not something I look forward to when I make a purchase for the ostensible purpose of ""pleasure"" reading.The reader can sense Mann's excitement in regard to the discovery of new evidence supporting his theories (and indeed, the evidence is convincing), but it's often hard to be as excited as Mann seems to be when the information is presented in such a droll manner.In all, the value of this book is in th perspective it provides and it does a serviceable job of that.

This book paints a much broader picture with current scholarship/research and such an easy tone that is a great pleasure to read. I really, really recommend this book to everyone. Read it more than once. It's vital knowledge written with passion and good humor and an eye toward historical justice."

Mann has meticulously researched recent discoveries which paint a very different picture of the 'new continent' prior to its development by European colonists. I remember being taught that pre-Columbian America was populated by savages who were virtually unchanged since the Stone Age. New archeological finds suggest a vastly more populated and complex continent whose populations altered and even improved their environment. Highly recommended."

74,1400032059,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1879990-adam,4,"Charles Mann wants us to reconsider Native Americans. Despite decades of research showing that Indians were more populous, socially complex, more ecologically consequential, and here much longer than previously thought, most people continue to hold the old view, which was largely informed by racism. Mann tackles each question in turn. He attacks the Clovis-first hypothesis and argues in favor of the Pleistocene overkill hypothesis. He argues for a High Count pre-contact population. He spends a lot of time demonstrating that polities in Central and South America were on par with Greek city states or feudal Europe in terms of internecine politics and war. The jist of all this, especially the last bit, is that we should respect Native Americans more because they were more widely settled, agricultural, and civilized than we give them credit for. As much as Mann is in the right in his facts, this line of reasoning leaves the real accomplishments and complexities of hunter-gatherer groups in the cold. By implication, we should continue viewing them as savages unworthy of respect. Of course, Mann is too polite and respectful overall to have meant this, but it is strongly implied simply through the absence of complementary discussion of how awesome these cultures were.Mann covers a lot of things that have been of interest to me. However, as I'm interested in them, I've read about them in more detail elsewhere. The reason I ended up reading the book was because so many permaculturists cite it as a justification and highest application of their art. Permaculture wants to mimic natural ecosystems to create highly efficient functional systems that can benefit human users while maintaining ecosystem services. At this stage it's not clear how well this can be done. Only a few large-scale permaculture farms exist, and they have not been thoroughly (ie scientifically) examined for their capacities in ecosystem services. More contentious still is the notion of altering ‚Äúwild‚Äù ecosystems to suit human needs in a non-destructive way. I know of no one who's actually done this, but it is something permaculture theory (such as it is) predicts to be possible. What does all this have to do with Native Americans? They are at the center of the biggest memes in American environmental thought: the wilderness myth. Native Americans are ecologically neutral. They lived lightly on the land and took only what they needed, using every part of the animal, etc, and left the whole landscape an untouched, Edenic forest primeval for Europeans to plunder. William Cronon brilliantly elucidated the contradiction inherent in this logic. Native Americans could not have made intensive use of their home for a long period of time without becoming active agents in the ecosystem. It was no wilderness, then, but an intentionally shaped and heavily used landscape. Mann's other points drive this home: the landscape yielded so much more than Native populations could harvest when Europeans began to record observations not because they were living lightly, but because their populations had been reduced up to 95% from the numbers that ate the millions of bison and took the mast before passenger pigeons could reach plague proportions and caught the salmon before they got so thick you could walk across them. Thus Mann paints a picture of the Americas as two-continent experiment in large-scale permaculture (though he never uses the term). There are a lot of similarities between the two models. Natives organized their landscapes in zones from the settlement to wilderness, including heavily used annual gardens in river valleys and open nut and fruit orchards nearby, with prairies and open woodland patches maintained with fire for grazing animals to hunt. Hunting was calculated to reduce breeding populations near Zone 1 type sites, killing pregnant females (something Krech cited as evidence of Natives' ecological incompetence) and young. They even encouraged beneficial animals, installing birdhouse gourds as nest sites for the Purple Martens who ate the flies breeding on village rubbish heaps (this last bit from Noah's Garden). Much of Eastern North America and the Amazon was supposedly managed as a food forest, one of permaculture's most charismatic and popular ideas. On the one hand, the permaculturists are right to cite 1491. It does show quite clearly that humans can manage ecosystems for their own needs in a way that doesn't undermine the whole ecosystem or make it impossible for most species to survive. That gives them a much better track record than us, certainly. If I'm a little hesitant to advocate global permaculture on a scale like the Indians practiced, it's only because there are some key differences between them and us that we tend to overlook. Permaculturists retain a Western worldview, and inherit from it many deep-seated ideas about land use that aren't easily eradicated (the wilderness myth, for one). For instance, many permies speak of creating systems that mimic ecosystems, when they are in every case simply altering existing ecosystems. Indian cultures evolved in tandem with their environments over many centuries. Of particular importance is cuisine. Native cultures utilized animals and plants available to them to create coherent and varied cuisines, which they learned to savor. Permies invariably raise plants and animals from the Eurasian domesticate set, which includes many of the invasive weeds that are ruining American ecosystems. They aren't integrated into the complex food webs, especially as larval food plants for beetles and butterflies, that most of the biodiversity in North America is premised in. So it remains an open question how well we can hope to create a whole artificial ecosystem with modern American permaculture. Permaculturists definitely downplay the role of invasive species more than they ought to, and in many cases continue to cavalierly introduce new ones, the same process that destroyed the American Chestnut and so many other key elements of our natural heritage. Mann does a nice job of focusing on the scientific debates involved in each of these questions, but definitely slants to one side in every case. Only occasionally did I feel he went beyond the evidence, and in that case he was careful to put the supposition in the mouth of one of his informants. A scientist working in the Amazon claimed that not only the river villages and orchards, but the whole Amazon rainforest, was designed and sculpted by Indian communities to serve their ends. This may well be the case, but it was clearly not supported by the evidence yet.To further his general agenda, Mann does a nice job of pairing every accomplishment and foible of each side with one of the other. Aztec human sacrifice is discussed alongside the contemporary mania for public hangings in Europe. The Inca had no writing system, but no Eurasian ever came up with rope bridges ‚Äì or produced an equitably distributed food surplus! In the same vein, it was novel to me to focus on the huge cultural consequences of the plagues. The products of cultural exchange are clearly hugely fruitful ‚Äì Mexican food combines the best of Aztec cuisine and the best of Spanish food (ie cheese). But most of the American cultures that interacted with Europeans had already lost much of their vigor and diversity to the plagues. We will never know what Wisconsin cuisine would be like now had the Winnebago and Menominee taught early settlers a greater appreciation for wild rice and hickory nuts. East Coast Indians learned to use European ships to independently operate expanded seaboard trading networks.Mann makes much of the apparent miracle involved in corn's evolution and diversification. He presents the teosinte and maize (of Mangelsdorf) theories as equals, though by the time he wrote the book apparently the mystery had largely been solved with genetics (teosinte won, though since the new scheme recognizes maize and teosinte as one species, Zea mays, I suppose you could still say maize is its own ancestor). It's still quite astonishing, though. Teosinte is nothing like corn and required many simultaneous mutations to reach a proto-corn subspecies. The further divergence of corn into the 5 main groups (pop, flint, flour, dent, and sweet) across the Americas was one of the most mutually transformative relationships between domesticate, culture, and landscape since the dog.

75,1400032059,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3363047-karel-baloun,5,"The native American societies ‚Äúwere bigger than previously believed, older and more sophisticated than previously believed, and they had a greater impact on the environment.‚Äù (p xiv) Mann proves each of these points in engrossing, elaborate, memorable stories. At over 400 pages, the book is a substantial commitment, but all fresh and unique.The genocide led by the diseases of the colonizers, was much more devastating than imagined, horribly killing perhaps 20-25% of all living humans within a few decades. Fortunately, this important book that fills in the largest blank space in history, is a great pleasure to read. Wish it had existed when I was a kid!The US constitution and American culture of freedom and individual rights was deeply influenced by the native tribes that lived near and indeed coexisted with the early new englanders. It is hard to understate this influence, as a key explanation of the vast psychological gap with Europe.Mayan heiroglyphs were only deciphered in the 1990s, which kind of explains why I didn‚Äôt know that this even had happened. Mann reverts so much of what we ‚Äúknew‚Äù, I‚Äôm surprising ways.Agriculture was independently discovered here, twice, perhaps not long after Jericho/Levant, around the same time as Sumer. Math and Astronomy were as advanced around 1000AD as anywhere, in a distinct alphabet of which almost all samples are lost. At least 14 major languages existed, and the first crossings were ling before the Bering Land Bridge of 18,000 yrs ago. In 1000AD, the city of Tiwanaku in Bolivia was both larger and more prosperous than Paris or London.The southern Maya destroyed each other through wars between competing cities, which didn‚Äôt leave enough resources to maintain their engineered water supply. More peaceful Mayan cities in the north survived through trade, though much the traditional culture collapsed with the lost legitimacy of the priesthood. Climate crises had indeed already weakened and consolidated some of these ancient civilizations, but European diseases wiped out 80-90% of the natives, with 5 or more waves of diseases.‚ÄúIf they want to return as much of the landscape as possible to its state in 1491, they will have to create the worlds largest gardens.

Instead, using the best tools they have and all the knowledge they can gather, they work to create future environments.

76,1400032059,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5734751-li-sian,5,"This should be required reading for everyone living in the Americas. Mann covers a vast amount of geography over a vast period of time, and while this occasionally gave me whiplash - where and when is he talking about now? - it probably speaks to the lack of popular non-fiction on this topic that he felt the need to shoehorn in that much scope. (On the other hand, prove me wrong! I'm open to recommendations on pre-Columbus America.) There's a lot of archaeology and back-and-forth on what archaeologists know, what they don't know, and what they can't agree on, which Mann made reasonably entertaining. One of the most engaging and poignant passages in the book, however, I found to be on Mexica art and poetry: According to Le√≥n-Portilla, one exit from this philosophical blind alley was seen by the fifteenth-century poet Ayocuan Cuetzpaltzin, who described it metaphorically, as poets will, by invoking the coyolli bird, known for its bell-like song:He goes his way singing, offering flowers.And his words rain down Like jade and quetzal plumes.Is this what pleases the Giver of Life?Is that the only truth on earth?Ayocuan's remarks cannot be fully understood out of the Nahuatl context, Le√≥n-Portilla argued. ""Flowers and song"" was a standard double epithet for poetry, the highest art; ""jade and quetzal feathers"" was a synecdoche for great value, in the way that Europeans might refer to ""gold and silver"". The song of the bird, spontaneously produced, stands for aesthetic inspiration. Ayocuan was suggesting, Le√≥n-Portilla said, that there is a time when humankind can touch the enduring truths that underlie our fleeting lives. That time is at the moment of artistic creation. ""From whence come the flowers [the artistic creations] that enrapture man?"" asks the poet. ""The songs that intoxicate, the lovely songs?"" And he answers: ""Only from His [that is, Om√©teotl's] home do they come, from the innermost part of heaven."" Through art alone, the Mexica said, can human beings approach the real.Cut short by Cort√©s, Mexica philsoophy did not have the chance to reach as far as Greek or Chinese philosophy... Now envision this kind of fertile back-and-forth happening in a hundred ways with a hundred cultures - the gifts from four centuries of intellectual exchange. One can hardly imagine anything more valuable. Think of the fruitful impact on Europe and its descendants from contacting Asia. Imagine the effect of these places and people from a second Asia. Along with the unparalleled loss of life, that is what vanished when smallpox came ashore."
77,1400032059,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1889783-emily,5,"I am about to embark on my third trip to Mexico in 13 months (for various coincidental reasons), so it feels like a good moment to revisit this book. I learned so much when I first read it, and have always been disappointed not to find newer books that build on it in the same readable vein. The experience of having visited some of these archaeological sites--standing in the middle of what was once a bustling city, but with the barest signage to indicate what the inhabitants' lives might have been like--heightens the sense of neglect that this book was calling out. In short, I wanted to restock my imagination before going back (a repeat visit to the Museum of Anthropology in Mexico City would be even more effective, but is not on the present itinerary). This is certainly a book that deserves my ""five stars of having permanently changed the way I look at something.""Here's what I originally wrote when the book came out in 2005, which was part of a longer blog post and starts kind of mid-thought:The author, Charles Mann, as a journalist, has no particular stake in the scholarly debate, and presents both sides of each argument in turn. You come away from it having learned about archaeological and anthropological method as well as the new theories. The author also writes well about his various adventures researching the book, which include a plane running out of fuel and a truly disgusting sounding meal.The first major section deals with the population of the Americas. It opens with a great anecdote: about an early 20th century anthropologist who studied a primitive group called the Siriono, whom he called ""among the most culturally backward peoples of the world."" The problem was that he had it all wrong:The Siriono were among the most culturally impoverished people in the world. But this was not because they were unchanged holdovers from humankind's ancient past, but because smallpox and influenza laid waste to their villages in the 1920s. Before the epidemics at least three thousand Siriono, and probably many more, lived in eastern Bolivia. By Holmberg's time fewer then 150 remained--a loss of more than 95 percent in less than a generation. [...] Even as the epidemics hit, the group was fighting the white cattle ranchers who were taking over the region. The Bolivian military aided the incursion by hunting down the Siriono and throwing them into what were, in effect, prison camps. [...] It was as if [Holmberg] had come across refugees from a Nazi concentration camp, and concluded that they belonged to a culture that had always been barefoot and starving. (9)This same error seems to have been made time and time again in the study of pre-Columbian America. Scholars believe that the very first contacts between explorers and Indians (before Europeans were attempting to colonize) exposed the Indians to diseases--smallpox, mostly--that killed as much as 95% of the population. When the 17th century colonists showed up and saw small bands of Indians foraging and camping, they were seeing the traumatized, disoriented remnants of much larger societies, not some idealized nature-loving innocents.The problem then becomes mathematical. If you say that the post-Columbian population of the Americas was X and hypothesize that 96% of the population was killed by disease (therefore, the pre-Columbian population = X/.04) you are going to come up with a vastly higher figure for the pre-Columbian population than you would if you assumed that only, say, 94% were killed. This has led to the accusation that archaeologists are creating millions of people out of thin air. Mann then discusses the study of these epidemics, for example, why they spread so quickly and had such high death rates. (On major explanation is that the Indians, having few domesticated animals--cf. the work of Jared Diamond--were much more susceptible to diseases that crossed from livestock to people than were the Europeans who brought the germs over, who'd been living among pigs and goats for centuries.)The second part of the book talks about Indian technology and, particularly, agriculture. It explains, for example, that Europeans and Indian societies made different use of tension and compression in engineering. When Europeans encountered an Indian rope bridge, which relies of course on tension, they were terrified because they had never seen bridges that didn't rely on visible arched supports (compression). The Indians did not use the wheel because they had no suitable domestic animals and slippery surfaces, not because they were simple-minded. Many of their tools and records were created of materials that rotted away quickly in the damp climate.But the most interesting discussion has to do with agriculture. Mann describes how the Indians appear to have created maize (corn), possibly the world's most useful crop, almost from scratch. ""Maize's closest relative is a mountain grass called teosinte that looks nothing like it [and] is not a practical food source."" (194) Somehow, Indians hybridized an edible version that doesn't ""shatter"" (its seed waits on the stem to be collected by humans), a process controlled by 16 genes in maize and teosinte, unlike wheat and barley in which that behavior is controlled by a single gene. No one seems to understand how they did it. Moreover, scholars now believe that parts of the ""natural"" American landscape were intentionally created by Indians--the Great Plains, for example, created over many hundreds of years by Indian fires in order to encourage a population of buffalo. In the Amazon, where the soil is so poor that it has been called ""wet desert,"" Indians started using swidden (also known as slash-and-burn) techniques to avoid exhausting any single area of soil, and they fostered seemingly random combinations of plants and animals that bolstered soil quality. Huge areas of the Amazon may be, in a sense, man-made.The book contains many more interesting little points that I won't bother to type out, and, despite its occasionally rambling feel, it does a good job of arguing a central point: Americans have, for centuries, used what they ""knew"" about the Indians to either excoriate or mythologize them. The new research makes it ever harder to reduce the Indians to soulful wanderers, innocent hunter-gatherers, or ruthless heathens; instead, it begins to reveal fascinating societies that rivalled those of contemporary Europe in population and sophistication."
78,1400032059,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11280858-amanda-van-parys,5,"Wow. It's sad that we do not pay more attention to the history of the Americas pre-colonialism. It is also sad that we (I can only speak for North America since I am unsure about what is taught in South America) do not know more. The lack of written evidence of the immensity, magnitude, and advancement of the Native American peoples does not mean it was not there. The Native Americans before colonialism were vast in population and rich in culture and technology. Unlike Europeans, they didn't have outside influence to provide them with all their so-called ""advancements"" and ""inventions"". They came up with everything on their own: government, the wheel, irrigation, terraforming, agriculture (3 of 5 of the world's major crops were developed in the Americas), the number 0... among many others. This was a fascinating and much-needed read! I feel this is one of those books that should be required reading in U.S. high schools or colleges - we would all be better served with this than the 8 pages in an American history textbook with outdated and completely non-useful information!"

And there's still so much we don't - and may never - know. The idea that the Americas were almost empty of humans by the 15th century never made sense to me - WHY was it empty considering its size and areas of great natural plenty? This books debunks that idea and provides hard archaeological science to back it up. The story that emerges is one of inadvertent and nonetheless appalling genocide - the emptying of two continents - and the rise of new peoples. Astonishing and heart-breaking. "
80,1400032059,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4708829-carole,5,"This is a startling read. The author relates new findings and interpretations by a variety of experts in different fields which provides radically different possible interpretations of the nature of life in the Americas before Columbus. The findings are presented in layman's language. Mann is a skilled journalist, after all. But you have to stop and take a deep breath every so often to absorb the information. I admire how he has presented all this. He has summarized it in three simple theses. He goes back to these repeatedly to keep a semblance of order. He also readily admits when some theories cannot be proved or are widely disputed. This is often the case. But this is a remarkable read, more accessible than I expected. It will change the way you think about 1492."

A great primer which shares some fascinating contemporary research and neatly frames the big issues about the pre-colonial history of the Americas.Whereas I used to think about human history as largely known or understandable, this book showed me that there are potentially infinite sagas of unknown history, some of which will never be recovered. The book presents the existential tragedy of the accidental (and later, intentional) genocide of the peoples of two continents. This idea has fundamentally changed how I think about the world."
83,1400032059,http://goodreads.com/user/show/595788-alex-telander,4,"If I were to ask you what you know on the subject of the people that lived in the Americas before the arrival of Columbus and how they got there, you‚Äôd likely tell me they came over from Asia during the last ice age and proceeded to populate North, Central and South America in their small numbers and lived a nominal existence, traveling in tribes, forming their small civilizations, such as the Incas, Aztecs and Mayans, which eventually disappeared and then their lives were changed for the better when Columbus arrived in 1492, and brought the western world of civilization to the Americas. Charles C. Mann noted essentially this when he read his son‚Äôs history books and saw that the supposed accurate history hadn‚Äôt changed since he‚Äôd been in high school, which didn‚Äôt seem right. And so began years of research and learning that has gone on to change the way the western world sees the history of the Americas pre-Columbus. While the book was revolutionary when it was released, went on to win awards and make a lot of ‚Äúbest of‚Äù lists, there is still a lot of educating of the world to be done with this true history; hopefully this book will help that cause.In 1491 Mann seeks to reveal the last thirty years of archaeological and anthropological research and discoveries with the hope that it will change and alter all the commonly held assumptions mentioned above. He does this in a well thought out way, revealing all the evidence and theory on particular subjects, like the whole population of people in the Americas, as well as the sizes and extents of the various empires that formed, and then proving what is the correct one and why, such as the astonishing fact that in 1491 there were likely more people living in the Americas than in Europe! He goes into detail on the Aztec and Mayan civilizations, revealing their true extensiveness and reach and the affect they had on the people, their development and knowledge, and simple things, like why they had invented the wheel but didn‚Äôt use it as a means of transportation, because the rocky or jungle terrain made traveling by wheel wouldn‚Äôt be inefficient. As to the supposed fact that the peopling of the Americas took place around twelve or thirteen thousand years ago with the Bering Strait land bridge, the evidence says otherwise, with some pointing to the mere existence of the peoples in the Americas before this period, as well as the crucial cutoff date with the end of the ice age not correctly coinciding with the people reaching South America according to the timeline; basically the evidence simply proves otherwise.By the end of the book, the reader has come to the incredible realization that most of what they learned in school about the Americas is completely wrong, and that this supposedly undiscovered continent went on to do amazing things for the rest of the world, such as providing it with three-fifths of the world‚Äôs grown goods, including corn (or maize), peppers, potatoes, tomatoes and squash. In fact the term ‚Äúnew world‚Äù may have been somewhat of a misnomer, as it seems possible the settling of the Americas may have happened before western civilization.Much as Guns, Germs and Steel was revolutionary in changing our outlook on the way the world is, 1491 has the same affect on how the world views the Americas, what its true history was, the immense effect it had on the world after Columbus, and how the idea that these people were simple and primitive is just ridiculous. The book is by no means an easy read, but once the reader makes it through, the fulfillment is well worthwhile and enlightening to say the least.Originally written on March 17, 2012 ¬©Alex C.

84,1400032059,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4430507-megan-olsen,3,"Fascinating and well-written, but not quite what I was expecting. It was much more academic than I had expected, reading more like a scholar's contribution to a field of study within academia than a book intended for a lay (albeit interested) audience. I couldn't tell if it was just the uninflected delivery of my audiobook narrator, but it got dry at times. I'd catch myself zoning out, and then I'd stop, skip back a bit & start the section over. When I made the (sometimes large) effort to pay attention, the subject matter was fascinating.Things I found interesting:~Challenging the assumption that the Europeans overtook the native populations because they had more advanced technology. Guns, yes. But Mann illustrates how the bow and arrow was actually a more precise weapon, faster reloading, better short and long range, and offering the attacker more stealth. The Native Americans had developed much better standards of personal and civic hygiene, moccasins (more comfortable than boots), canoes (much more nimble than the European boats); used llamas to traverses winding mountain passes where the European horses were rendered useless. And along these lines, the different philosophies (Euro vs. Inca) on the societal role of metal, and how gun development precipitated from that.~A fascinating discussion on just why the native population was so susceptible to European diseases, due to being more genetically homogenous than Europeans. The outbreak stories, and scientific discussion, that Mann gives us is extremely interesting.~Dead mummies (panaqa) had political influence in ""Inka"" society. Totally. Sweet.~The insights into what actually 'went down' at our idealized version of the First Thanksgiving. :)~It was interesting, but also a little convoluted and confusing, to read/listen about the possible origin or migration date of the New World peoples. He mentions -- and then promptly dismisses -- the Book of Mormon's theory, but it seems like he didn't really understand that the BOM has peoples migrating in multiple waves, tens of thousands of years apart. Knowing this, it was pretty interesting to hear what modern scholarship has to say. I don't know if others would find this section as interesting, however.~Native tendencies toward democracy (at least in the North -- the Five Nations), female rights, and the European settlers' positive, even envious, reaction to this. :)~The khipu (knotted strings) writing system. Cool!~The wheel in the New World~The fall of the Triple AllianceTo sum it up, I would probably mention this book to someone who was already very interested in the pre-Columbian Native peoples, or to someone who was writing their thesis on that subject. But if someone casually asked me, 'Read any nonfiction lately? I'm looking for a new book."" I would probably NOT start by suggesting this. Very interesting, but very academic. "
85,1400032059,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7672919-jerome,4,"Although recent years have yielded significant progress in understanding how ""Indians"" lived throughout the Americas before 1492 and Columbus, only isolated bits of the story have reached the popular press. Far too many people still hold to one of two myths of the Indians, or have little conception at all of pre-Columbian America.The first popular myth is that the Indians were a bunch of primitive savages just keeping the land warm until superior Europeans showed up. It's sad to read reviews here that assert that because Indians used stone tools they were therefore ""stone age"", with the implication that their culture was no further advanced than that early period.The second myth makes the Indians into proto-flower-children, naively and simply in tune with their environment.Both myths are based on stereotyping and are condescending to the pre-Colombians. How could people spread over two continents and many millennia be briefly summarized? They can't be! The Americas saw the development of a broad range of cultures, just like every other inhabited area of the world. Some cultures overstressed their environment and soon collapsed. Others created stable conditions under which they could survive for generations. (Which is not the same as saying they didn't impact nature.) But even the latter could be brought down by climate change, political instability, disease (especially European), or contact with outsiders (Indian or European).Great cities arose in mesoamerica and the Andes, and also in other areas when the right conditions prevailed. And sophisticated cultures existed even where city building wasn't favored.This book takes the reader through a vibrant overview of centuries of Indian culture both before and shortly after Columbus landed. Much of the narrative is based on work-in-progress by archaeologists and historians, and will certainly become dated with time, but it is an important update to the common, current understanding of the subject.For those not enthralled by one of the myths I mention above, most Americans recall our history along the lines of Scene 1: The Pilgrims land and encounter Indians who teach them how to grow corn; they then have a big Thanksgiving party together. Scene 2: Americans moving inland encounter savage Indians who need to be exterminated or moved to reservations to make the continent safe for manifest destiny. Scene 3: The few remaining Indians are victims of brutal European suppression, and we need to buy jewelry and pottery from them to make ourselves feel better about the situation.This book is a welcome update to our thinking about the Americas before Columbus. It's also one of the best books I've read in long time, and I highly recommend it."

It's a really solid book, based on extensive research and reporting scholarly disputes and the evolution of interpretations of the evidence, combined with anecdata of Mann's own encounters with both researchers and the descendants of the researched. (Incidentally, he reports that the latter generally identify with and use the term ""Indians"" to refer to themselves, so he follows their lead.)I took three main points away from the book. First, that the series of plagues inflicted on the peoples of the Americas by Europeans was one of the most catastrophic events in human history. The lowest estimate of population decrease due to disease in what is now Latin America (home to two large and well-developed polities) in the 16th century is a whopping 90%. Disease spread much faster than Europeans, who often arrived (like the Pilgrims) into territory where the indigenous human activity had simply died off. It's difficult to grasp the scale of the catastrophe.Second, immense amounts of important human culture have therefore simply been lost. I was aware of the fact that only four Mayan manuscripts survive. I wasn't aware that there are also eight from the √ëudzahui (Mixtec) culture, including the brilliant story of 8-Deer Jaguar Claw, which is surely ready for dramatization. I had certainly never heard of the Cahokia Mounds, in southern Illinois just across the Mississippi from St Louis, Missouri, which sound utterly fantastic. So little is known; so much has been destroyed.Third, Mann makes the daring suggestion that American concepts of liberty and freedom actually owe much more to the influence of the Haudenosaunee confederacy (aka the Iroquois) than is generally relised. He quotes John Adams reminiscing about his relationship with local Indian chiefs in mid-18th-century Massachusetts, and points out that the ideals of personal freedom from oppression were practiced much more by Indians than by Europeans. He goes a step further, and wonders if it's coincidence that slavery was generally practiced by Indians south of what became the Mason-Dixon line, but not by those to its north. I'm not sure about the latter point, but the rest of it is a very attractive concept.Anyway, a book that thoroughly illuminated my own ignorance."
87,1400032059,http://goodreads.com/user/show/889092-benjamin,5,"Excellent collation of research on Indian history that has sparked controversy not only in the discipline of history but sustainable ecology - it trenchantly organizes and presents evidence not completely unknown to myself, but not presented for collective impact on the knowledgeable generalist until now. Viewed as a whole, it cogently elaborates the controversies and agendas driving various parties, Indian and white, archaelologist and environmentalist, seeking to influence not only how people view the history of the Americas prior to 1491, but the future, too. Easily the most incendiary critique originates in his presentation of evidence suggesting that, contra to myths of primeval landscapes unblemished by man that originated in the wake of demographic collapse, all of the Americas, including the Amazon, swarmed with peoples that managed and altered the landscape to their desires. This conceit undermines the supposition that a human presence in environments like the Amazon can only prove deleterious - while the evidence suggests that the Amazon, along with other environments, were thrown out kilter in the massive die off of Indian populations that managed them for their own use. The populations encountered in later epochs of intense European settlement, relatively savage and few in number, should not be considered definitive iterations of Indian culture and accomplishment anymore than Rome's medieval squalor in wake of the Empire's collapse should be considered the sum total of Rome's achievement. Mann instead recontextualizes them as the indomitable but traumatized remnnants of cultures and peoples immolated by small pox, typhoid, and other diseases to the point that they could not sustain their former way of life, leading to ecologocal disruption across the Americas and altering a formerly human managed landscape into the ""primeval continent of forest"" encountered by British colonists so influential in shaping America's image not only of itself, but of its Indian peoples, even as the myth continues to exert influence on America's vigorous environmental movement. This book explores far more of interest than I could ever present, but hopefully this little salvo grants some intimation of what awaits the curious reader."

The kind that praises the Inca‚Äîsorry, Inka‚Äîfor establishing an empire in every sense of the word‚Äîafter all, ``empire'' isn't a bad word to liberals; it's just advanced civilisation‚Ä†‚Äîand can only bring itself to condemning them to the extent that they can be compared to Stalinist Russia or Maoist China as they exist in liberal discourse (but not, mostly, reality).Mann's ideology can't be separated from the rest of the book because it doesn't just exist as constant, harmful background radiation‚Äîit leads him to be fundamentally incapable or unwilling to separate established, well-founded archaeo-anthropology from things that are extremely tentative, just emerging, or outright fringe‚Äîlike all journalists, he sure spends a lot of money flying out to places for no reason, but never manages to convey any information beyond the level of he-said, she-said‚Äîand to attack proponents of any theory he doesn't like as close-minded racists regardless of their actual credibility. And because he a is journalist, even incidental trivia usually manages to be false‚Äîe.g. everything he knows about the history of zero, which returns a few times for obvious reasons, is plagued by the usual exhausting myths.Not every point Mann is trying to make is bad or even controversial‚Äîseparating the bad from the good just requires that you do all of his work for him as you read.Journalists really need to stop writing books.----------------‚Ä† And ``civilisation'' is, of course, explicitly defined as social stratification. That's a disorder that's much older than Americans, though."

Fitting all the data, Mann put together a portrait of Indians that is probably largely unfamiliar to those of us who relied on accounts told by the perpetrators and winners of the genocide that took place after 1492. His account is fairly dry at times. It felt as if he wanted to get every detail in the book but wasn't quite sure how to weave it into a story.So, if you require passion in a book, this probably isn't the best match. However, if you are interested in correcting the incorrect assumptions you may have been holding onto, this is worth the read. It is clear that Jared Diamond was a huge influence for this author. His work was highlighted so often, I found myself wishing Diamond would write a book that narrows its focus to the history of Native Americans. I really enjoyed Guns, Germs, and Steel and could easily imagine Diamond researching a bit more about Native Americans in order to writing an engaging book solely about their plight. I heard that Mann wrote a scathing review of Harari's Sapiens. This really surprised me because sapiens was, in my opinion, one of the best books of 2015. Mann could have benefitted from adopting Harari's writing style. Regardless of his style, Mann does an excellent job of setting the record straight, as well as explaining the many roadblocks that resulted in the misrepresentation of Indians. I could not help but go back to every memory I had of Squanto, and at times I just sat in disbelief, remembering story hour in my elementary school library. Even though other books clued me into the fact that Indians had a rich culture that was not at all inline with what American children are taught, this book really helped drive than home. If you enjoyed this book, I highly recommend Dee Brown's 1970's book, Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee. It relies on historical tellings instead of the science Mann is privy to, but it was an excellent read. "
