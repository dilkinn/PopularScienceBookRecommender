Absolutely. I love Martin Gardner.But I am so angry that all these years later his writing comes off as prescient and timely and topical.Sorry if this is all a bit disjointed, I'm still fuming. Read this and we can fume together."
2,0486203948,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61519-aerin,4,"(Original review date: 23 January 2013) How do you tell a scientist from a crank?It's a difficult assessment, but it turns out that there are subtle but important linguistic clues.For example, a crank might say:""To know of the earth's concavity... is to know God, while to believe in the earth's convexity is to deny Him and all his works. All that is opposed to Koreshanity is antichrist.""- Koresh (b. Cyrus Reed Teed), self-proclaimed messiah, who believed that we live on the inside of a hollow sphere.""Either you believe in me and learn, or you must be treated as an enemy.""- Hans Hörbiger, who believed that our current moon is the sixth of its kind, all previous moons having been sucked into the Earth like manic tetherballs.""When I look into the vastness of space and see the marvelous workings of its contents... I sometimes think that I was born ten or twenty thousand years ahead of time... [My] mind responds to every question and the problems that stagger the so-called wise men are as kindergarten stuff to [me].""- Alfred William Lawson, Supreme Head and First Knowlegian of the University of Lawsonomy, who believed that two types of microscopic creatures live in the human brain and control our behavior: the virtuous ""menorgs"", and the devious ""disorgs"".""We believe our work to be of God; we are actuated by no selfish or mercenary motive. We depreciate personal antagonisms of every kind, but we proclaim a ceaseless antagonism to that great evil, the French Metric System... It is the Battle of the Standards. May our banner be ever upheld in the cause of Truth, Freedom, and Universal Brotherhood, founded upon a just weight and just measure, which alone are acceptable to the Lord.""- The International Institute for Preserving and Perfecting Weights and Measures, who believed that the English measurement system was handed down by God and revealed in the Great Pyramid, while the metric system is an atheistic abomination.""What kept [the lonely eagle] from [eating all the inferior chickens] was a small hope. The hope, namely, that among the many cackling chicks there might be, one day, a little eagle capable like himself, to look from his lofty perch into the far distance, in order to detect new worlds, new thoughts, and new forms of living.""- William Reich, founder of orgonomy, who believed that all living things are infused with a blue-colored life force called orgone energy, and that all neuroses can be cured by a really good orgasm.""The Creation of dianetics is a milestone for Man comparable to his discovery of fire and superior to his inventions of the wheel and arch.""- L. Ron Hubbard (aka The Master), founder of Dianetics and Scientology, who believed that all psychiatric conditions are caused by perceptual recordings made while we were zygotes, which can only be ""processed"" by a lengthy system of ""auditing"". See also: Xenu.While a scientist might say:""A true genius admits that he knows nothing.""- Albert Einstein, who believed that E = mc2.It's surprising how entertaining and relevant this book remains, 60 years after it was first published. Though many of the titular fads and fallacies are now (thankfully) defunct, many others are still going strong. People will always be gullible.With chapters on everything from flying saucers to Atlantis to food fads and wacky sexual theories, the book does a decent job of running the gamut of crackpottery. And Martin Gardner is an engaging escort through all the insanity, injecting just the right amount of sarcasm where appropriate, but often just letting the cranks speak for themselves. (Though hardly a crank, my favorite quote in the whole book comes from Alfred Kinsey, in defense of premature ejaculators: ""It would be difficult to find another situation in which an individual who was quick and intense in his responses was labeled anything but superior."" HA HA HA, whatever dude.)The book does drag in places (how many inane medical ""theories"" do we really need to delve into?), but it hits more than it misses. Especially worthwhile are the chapters on flat & hollow earth theories, sexual ideologies, and Scientology (then called ""Dianetics"" and only two years old - Gardner thought the fad was on its way out)."
3,0486203948,http://goodreads.com/user/show/127341-g026r,3,"An interesting and enjoyable read, but like the somewhat similarly themed 
Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds
 it suffers from a few noteworthy issues.The first is the lack of references. Quotes occur often, but the exact location they are drawn from is not always attributed. Now, I will admit that I'm unlikely to track down any of the works mentioned (OK, maybe some of the Hollow Earth ones), but at the same time a reference as to where and when a quote was stated would make the book seem a bit less light and allow a somewhat better chronological structuring of the surveyed cranks' changes in opinions.The second is that, nearly 60 years after the first edition and more than 50 since the second, the book is quite simply dated. Many cultural references that would have been common knowledge in 1952 whiz by without nary a spark in the memory. The same goes for various fads that are referenced with the expectation that the reader knows what they are, but not covered in more detail.In summary: interesting, but desperately in need of an editor to go through and add explanatory notes for those of us who weren't alive in the early '50s or commentary for when various facets of the information presented have changed drastically.Amusing side-note: the number of science fiction authors and editors, often fairly recognizable names, who show up in here as proponents of the various beliefs is certainly something."
4,0486203948,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52152494-catalin-negru,5,"Target audience: The primary target are common people, with little or no scientific literacy. The secondary target are people in love with mysticism.About the author: According to Wikipedia, was an American popular mathematics and popular science writer, with interests also encompassing scientific skepticism, micromagic, philosophy, religion, and literature - especially the writings of Lewis Carroll, L. Frank Baum, and G. K. Chesterton. Gardner was best known for creating and sustaining interest in recreational mathematics - and by extension, mathematics in general - throughout the latter half of the 20th century, principally through his ""Mathematical Games"" columns. These appeared for twenty-five years inScientific American, and his subsequent books collecting them.Structure of the book: The book is 384 pages long, which are divided into 26 chapters plus other additional parts (notes, preface and so one).Overview: Basically, the book debunks what it characterizes as pseudo-science and the pseudo-scientists who propagate it. And, unfortunately, the subjects and examples are many; evidence of 373 pages. Yes, the book is long. If you like science, you won’t get bored. However, if you are fan of mysticism, this is a hard pill to swallow; it will shred your dearest beliefs.Gardner starts by describing/defining “cranks” and “pseudo-scientists”, so that people with low scientific literacy can recognize them. Then he patiently takes theories and personalities, one by one, puts them in groups, describes them and then dismisses them point by point using logic, scientific arguments and common sense. Flat-earth theory, hollow-earth theory, anti-vaccine, flying saucer, vegetarianism, L. Ron Hubbard, Atlantis and Lemuria – you name it. Occasionally he also uses historical examples of previous failures or a welcome portion of humor. As a science fan, I was familiar with the myth of Atlantis or pyramidology, but that does not mean I did not enjoy those parts. There is always something new to be learned. This book was originally written in 1952. We are in now 2019 (or more). Why do I say this? Because, as a reader, you are pretty shocked about how current are certain pseudo-scientific theories and how hard mindsets can change. Yes, we are in the age of artificial intelligence, smart cars, green energy and voyages to Mars. Yet, homeopathy, astrology, scientology and other are non-sense are still thriving. How is that possible? The answer is simple, but not obvious: while mankind’s knowledge is expanding faster than the individual knowledge. “Cross-pollenisation between sciences” (as Neil deGrasse Tyson likes to say) and the passing of information from one man to another – they all take time.Quote: There is no evidence whatever that meat plays a significant role in causing bodily disorders, least of all cancer, which some vegetarians, trace to meat by means of wildly distorted statistics.Strong points: Well research and a sense of humor and a good structure.Weak points: I felt that Garner offered too much attention to certain subjects, such as Ron L. Hubbard and his philosophy. I don’t think such frauds deserve so much attention."
5,0486203948,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7575177-matthew-mccrady,5,"Although the book is quite old, it still has much to offer the modern skeptic, since many of the ""fads and fallacies"" of sixty years ago are still around. Scientology is a case in point. At the time Gardner was writing, it was in its birth pangs and was called Dianetics. He didn't take it very seriously, thinking that it had already spent itself. What he has to say about L. Ron Hubbard is interesting, though I am sure more is known today. Gardner accepts Hubbard's war hero status without question, although as I understand it, today there are questions about his service. Still Gardner doesn't flinch from pointing out the flaws in Hubbard's own life, character, and work. He also tackles pseudosciences such as parapsychology and paranormal research (currently enjoying a revival on reality TV). The chapters on the history of medical quackery are especially interesting. I'd have liked a longer chapter on the tangle of fallacies around sexuality, but perhaps that was deemed of questionable taste at the time the book was published. Anyway, Mary Roach has done an admirable job of filling in those historical gaps with her book ""Boink"". "
6,0486203948,http://goodreads.com/user/show/123081-david-gross,4,"A romp through the curious worlds occupied by influential crank scientists — worlds in which the earth is flat or hollow, and invisible orgone radiation will help us undo our prenatal mental implants and fend off the saucer people. You’ll recognize many of the names (L. Ron Hubbard, Wilhelm Reich, Immanuel Velikovsky) and be first introduced to many others. Gardner acknowledges that there is a broad grey area between crank science and orthodox science where wild (but perhaps true) theories live, and that often orthodox science is just plain wrong, but he insists that there is a well-defined and identifiable arena for cranks. He shows no overt sympathy for these loonies, but his affection for their eccentricities shines through. The book was published in the 1950s, and so is slightly dated, but I wouldn't let this stop you."
7,0486203948,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34138597-nick,0,"(Haven't read this cover-to-cover, I just pick it up every now and again.)Martin Gardner is remembered today for his work as one of the first successful ""pop scientists."" You could say he was the Carl Sagan of the 40's and 50's, but the comparison ends at the surface; Gardner was a polymath who attained academic recognition slowly, through his writing, whereas Sagan followed a more or less traditional path to the top of the ivory tower, and from there began preaching. In temperament, where Sagan strives for profundity--small blue marble, billions and billions, the anti-armament Kumbayas of his PBS series Cosmos--Gardner was content with acerbity. Sagan was a Christ figure, Gardner was the bad boy shooting spitballs into supercolliders. Sagan attempted to convert the masses to scientism; Gardner mocked those not on board. Sagan=MLK, Gardner=Malcolm X.I prefer Gardner. This little book of essays exists only to take pot shots at the pseudoscience industry, which flourished in the 50's. Scientology is taken on here (back when it was seen as merely the latest fad within Hubbard's larger ""Dianetics"" movement), as are the bizarre Nazi cosmologies of Hans Horbinger and others. (Hitler so favored Horbinger's theory--that the entire universe was once a large ball of ice, which has since been broken up and melted into varying stages, which compose the elements--that he once proposed building a museum that would dramatize the fundamentalist cosmology on the first floor, the big bang on the second, and Horbinger's on the third and final floor! Nuts, right?)Of particular interest to me was the chapter on Alfred Lawson, one of the most overlooked figures in Iowa history and the history of quack science in general. ""Fads and Fallacies"" was a useful source when I was writing a paper on Mr. Lawson, whose story involves failed careers in baseball, fiction-writing, aviation, and economics, before founding his own (tax-exempt) cult/commune, the Des Moines University of Lawsonomy, a few miles from where I live in Des Moines, Iowa. The University was devoted entirely to inculcating in its ""students"" (most of whom lived on-campus) a complete knowledge of Lawson's teachings, previously espoused in several dozen self-published volumes. The proposed course of study lasted 30 years. It took so long because one could only graduate (and become, in Lawsonomic terms, a ""Knowledgian"") after they had memorized every word Lawson ever put to paper. The University opened in 1943 and closed shortly after Lawson's death in 1954. Lawson was the only Knowledgian, and remained so until more than a decade after his death, when one of his foremost followers, a man named Merle Hayden, began giving out the title at Lawsonomy reunions in the 70's. (Hayden now lives on a farm on a highway outside Racine, Wisconsin, in a house adrift with accumulated paraphernalia--Lawsonomic books and newspapers, paperwork from the University, photographs of Lawson and he smiling side by side, inquisitive letters from those who were children in Des Moines when the University stood, who walked along its fence and wondered what went on inside, all of which Hayden answers--filling the house like floodwater to the attic, on the exterior of which is written, handpainted in neat white capitals over the aging shingles: ""PRACTICE NATURAL LAW""; now and then lost tourists cross it, their children point it out to them across the corn fields, and most of them drive on, anxious to get to the Dells; once every year or two, one of these cars stops for gas, or coffee, and the stories begin again...)Sorry about that. Anyway. One other essay that stands out is the one on chiropractors, who I have always considered to be quacks but who seem to have gained mainstream acceptance since this was published. The shift from chiropractice (chiropractition? are either of these words?) as New Age contemporary of L. Ron Hubbard and alchemists to chiropractice as contemporary of Dr. Scholl and OBGYNs is yet further proof that pseudoscience is alive and well today. It is also proof that Gardner's work must be continued, and we are in need of someone to pick up the torch. Richard Dawkins doesn't cut it; he is a fine biologist but a mean man, of insufficient warmth to appeal to anyone not already in agreement, and so lacking in imagination--perhaps inherently but I suspect willfully--to interpret religious doctrine in any other way than, like the Fundamentalists he so despises, literally. Gardner had great affection for the bears he poked. He understood the appeal of a worldview which rejects reason, and reveled in it, viewing the bizarre movements he wrote about as a sort of performance art, appreciating their metaphors as would any student of world religion those of Hinduism and Christianity. We need a scientist who is capable of great cognitive dissonance and is unashamed of it. In our present divided culture, which has politicized science and religion and set them opposed, scientists of just such imagination have tuned out entirely, preferring to play in the lab than settle the territory disputes our gang-like libs and cons have waged. In wait of such a person, I'll be picking up Gardner every now and again."
8,0486203948,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3498889-cheryl,0,"No doubt important in its time, but dated to the point of irrelevancy (to me and anyone with whom I interact) now. That's all."

10,0486203948,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2559542-pete-jones,2,"I bought this book because as a kid I used to subscribe to “Scientific American”, primarily because of Martin Gardner’s articles on mathematical games. But this is nothing like those pieces. Much of the time it comes across as a rabid foaming at the mouth book describing the 1950’s and the preceding century as a world full of pseudo-scientists leading a world full of sheep back into the dark ages. It’s so over the top that I believe anyone who hadn’t lived through those times would find it hard to believe that if that was the state of the world at that time, that we even live in the “modern times” we do today. He rails at pseudo-scientists who believe the world is flat; or hollow and we live inside the sphere. Interestingly, though he steps into to the argument between those who accept the age of the earth from geology and those who believe in the six day time frame in the book of Genesis he does provide a theory by zoologist Philip Gosse. It is a very clever supposition that the world might have actually been created a couple of minutes ago. Gardner says of it Gosse’s book Omphalos, “Not the least of its remarkable virtues is that although it won not a single convert, it presented a theory so logically perfect, and so in accord with geological facts that no amount of scientific evidence will ever be able to refute it.” You’ll have to read the book to understand.Gardner covers everything from dowsing rods, ESP, anti-gravity shields, Atlantis and Lemuris, dianetics, curing poor eyesight via muscle training called “central fixation” rather than glasses, to phrenology. These are just a sampling of the topics covered in the 26 chapters, each covering different subject matters. It seems ironic that throughout the book it comes across that he is attacking the pseudo-scientists the same way they are defending themselves; by attempting to shout more things that appear to support their point of view than the other side. There is no mention of using scientific methods to prove or refute the theories.Two chapters stand out above the others as a sign of the times in which this book was written and brings one to question whether much of this is motivated by the author’s personal views. Chapter 12 called “Lysenkoism” deals with Lamarckianism. Lamarckianism differs from the theory of evolution in that it posits that changes over time occur as the inheritance of acquired characteristic, rather than via the survival of the fittest. Gardner provides a history of this theory and then dedicates most of the remainder of the chapter on the rejection of Darwin’s work by the Communist Party of the USSR as bourgeois idealism. The Soviets believe Lamarckianism supports the idea that “Russian children can be taught that the Revolution has “shattered” the hereditary structure of the Soviet people—that each new generation growing up in the new environment will be a finer stock than the last.”The term Lysenkoism is derived from Trofim Lysenko a “former peasant and plant-breeder” who rose as one of the most influential proponents of this view. Much of the chapter that follows is a description of what happened to scientists in the USSR who didn’t toe the party line.Towards the end of the chapter Gardner states:“It may be that the steady deterioration of Soviet biology will be followed by a similar deterioration in other sciences. We know now how greatly the Nazi efforts to make an atom bomb were bungled by the control of political Neanderthals. There is reasonable ground for hope that a similar state of affairs may, to some degree, hamper Soviet war research.”He then brings up the Scopes trial in the United States, stating that though this provides a dramatic lesson for the free works…our sins in this respect have not been very grave.Chapter 13, called “Apologist for Hate” follows. It is a clear condemnation of the theories that support Nordic and Aryan race superiority. Because of the recent end of the WWII and the beginnings of the civil rights movement in the United States, some of the Gardner’s statements come across with less scientific force and with more with vehemence against who support the superiority of whites. Though his points are well presented and supported, it sometimes reads more like an editorial than a book of non-fiction. Though I lived through those times, and back then blacks were Negroes, it still sticks in my craw when I hear that term.Overall the book is interesting, more as a novelty than a scientific exposition on quack theories. But then again as he states in his book, most serious scientists don’t think the topics are worth their effort to refute."
11,0486203948,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8464281-darnell,4,"This book was a lot of fun. It's not an in-depth criticism of the topics covered, instead functioning more like a friend reading something you both agree is ridiculous and reading aloud the best parts. Less dated that you might expect for a book written in 1952, both in the author's attitude and in the topics covered."
12,0486203948,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19115189-dj,4,"So this book was more fun than I would have expected. This is basically a book that debunks various things that are on the fringe or are pseudoscience. The fun part of this book is that it was written in the late fifties or early sixties (I know I could look it up, but I am being lazy.). The number of things that are brought up that are still relevant in the modern-day sixty years later is amazing. The other wild thing about this book is it doesn't dance around saying it is full of it just coming out and saying things about how wrong it is and why. Much less politeness than the modern books on the topic. To start with it has the best explanation I have ever seen as to why a weather balloon might be thought to be an alien craft. If the book had done nothing else than that I would have been thankful to have been able to read it. It also goes over Homeopathy letting you have an idea just how old this 'alternative' medicine has been floating around. The verdict is the same as most of the modern works. If you dilute the ingredient that many times, there is no ingredient in the cure. Chiropractic Medicine is brought up and one of the most interesting experiments in regards to testing the veracity of an 'alternate' medicine is brought up. Although it would be expensive. It was suggested you go to a practitioner and get a diagnosis and then go to another and so on until you get two that match. For me, the chapter had another reason for interest, since it mentioned Palmer Chiropractic Jr. College, which happens to be in Davenport Ia. The place I just happened to be born. The school had a pretty good garden and Palmer gave a number of the exhibits for the cities museum. The best one that came up as far as I was concerned was Dianetics/Church of Scientology. It also had the worst prediction of the entire book. The author went into a review of L. Ron Hubbard's life and career as a Sci-Fi writer, without a great deal of buttering up. Then at the end of the chapter, he said that he thought that this fad had run its course. As anyone around now can say, that doesn't seem to be the case. It seems to be a bit bigger than ever. A great book and somewhat of an eye-opener. "
13,0486203948,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7290805-sheryl-tribble,3,"Took longer to get into than other books by Gardner I have read. Felt very ""list like"" for a long time, just a rundown of items that fit that chapter's subject but about halfway through it felt a bit more like it had been considered by a human mind. He still didn't give you a good feel for the people he was talking about, but shared more of himself, I guess.I am now wondering if Scully from The X-Files was named after Frank Scully, author of the hoax book Behind the Flying Saucers.And I had to crack up when he called George McCready Price ""the last and greatest of the anti-evolutionists"" -- Price now has plenty of competition."
14,0486203948,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1232586-ian,5,"I read this as a kid and it's stayed with me ever since. Gardner's takedowns of various pseudosciences, from now-long-forgotten crackpottery like Fletcherism to others, like Dianetics and its current incarnation, Scientology, which continue to plague us to this day, are the perfect thing for a budding skeptic to hone their critical thinking skills on, skills that are needed more than ever in a world in which delusions like birtherism, climate change denial, ""intelligent design"" creationism, ""alternative"" medicine, and the like are just as prevalent (if not more so thanks to the Internet)."
15,0486203948,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8769112-craig,2,"Too many descriptions of fads and pseudo-scientists who have long since faded away. Too many references to ideas and people ""in the news"" that were completely unfamiliar to me. The opening chapter on the nature of pseudo-science was interesting, but most of the following summaries of specifics were dull and repetitious."
16,0486203948,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19836459-jerry-petersen,1,"Way outdatedThis book goes back to 1957, so is badly in need of an update. It does, however, prove the adage, the more things change the more they stay the same.

17,0486203948,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2122765-robert,5,"This is the classic work on pseudoscience. Gardner is also an insightful and amusing writer.

18,0486203948,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1097517-barry-cunningham,4,"Still interesting This book, though a little dated in its examples and details, is still a classic and worth a read.This is actually at least the third time that I’ve read it. The first time was sometime in the late 1950s when I was still in elementary school. Much of it was above my head then, so I think I didn’t finish it then, getting bogged down someplace in the orgones.I read it again around 1970 during my senior year at MIT. It was a good reminder to me at that time of what science was about and that however cool and trendy the psychic hoogie-moogie, astrology, and occultism of my friends early in the Aquarian Age seemed, ultimately it had to be self delusion or fraud.The bits that are now the most dated are simply the refutations of the fallacies being debunked; 70 more years of scientific progress makes it much easier find disproofs, especially in the fields of genetics, biology, planetary science, and physics."
19,0486203948,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10047973-stephen,4,"A justified classic of scientific skepticism, and don't let the mid-20th-c. publication date fool you: a large chunk of the titular fads and fallacies Gardner describes are still limping along into $CURRENT_YEAR, and in several cases are stronger than ever. (Especially depressing are the cases of homeopathy, anti-vaccine hysteria, UFOs, creationism, and Scientology, all of which Gardner believed would peter out relatively quickly.)Caveats: Gardner was a decent and liberal-minded man but some of the terminology of the Fifties is just not. Perhaps a bigger problem, though, is that Gardner is rather inconsistent with his citations - he freely name-drops books and articles for further information reading, but there's no structured bibliography which makes reference harder.Overall, 4.5 stars, rounded down because of the aforementioned blemishes."
20,0486203948,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11003362-david,3,"Ordered this book on a whim off a list on the back of the Malleus Maleficarum, another Dover book. It's sometimes funny to read old non-fiction books, especially if they involve ""current"" events. Surprisingly, some of the fads and fallacies are still around today. Gardener's chapter on Scientology kind of left it hanging like it was about to go away, and look at them now. I love reading about crack-pot ideas (see the above Maleficarum!), and it was nice to see someone calling bullshit on some of this stuff 60 years ago. A pretty fun, but dated read."
21,0486203948,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47349422-nuno,3,"Interesting and whitty book, but some views are probably outdated as it was written more than 50 years ago."
22,0486203948,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5963979-jim-razinha,5,"This classic, from the godfather of skepticism, was a must for my Year of Nostalgic Re-reads. My original copy was lost to a fire in 2013, which while replaceable, also took all of my margin notes, which sadly were not. This time through I made all new ones. Where to start? I was always amazed at how Gardner was so polite in his skewering. (He was less so when answering responses from the ""offended"", not in this book, but in others...) But, I am most impressed with the incredible access to sources Gardner had, and that he seemed to have read. I have no idea how he was able to track down, and obtain, pre-Internet and pre-connected world, such obscure texts. But he did.One anecdote related to one of Gardner's targets: 15 years ago, a friend asked if I had ever heard of Immanuel Velikovsky. I was surprised anyone else had heard of him! Anyway, the friend gave me a copy of Worlds in Collision. Suddenly, I had access to an obscure text!From flat earthers, to Wilhelm Reich's orgone, to medical cults like chiropractic, Gardner spared none of the cranks he examined. I think my favorite was his cover of L. Ron Hubbard's dianetics, the precursor of Scientology. I'll highlight here something from the introduction, and then something from the conclusion. Gardner says that a crank's - a ""sincere pseudo-scientist's"" - paranoid tendencies are likely to be exhibited as:1. He considers himself a genius.2. He regards his colleagues, without exception, as ignorant blockheads.3. He believes himself unjustly persecuted and discriminated against.4. He has strong compulsions to focus his attacks on the greatest scientists and the best-established theories.5. He often has a tendency to write in a complex jargon, in many cases making use of terms and phrases he himself has coined.I leave the original gender as is. Gardner, however intelligent, was still a product of his times. And from the conclusion...The spectacular recent successes of pseudo-science have a value also in publicizing aspects of our culture that are much in need of improvement. We need better science education in our schools. [emphasis mine] We need more and better popularizer of science. Remembering this was published in 1952...and in the 63 years since it is only worse, with the Deepak Choprahs of today peddling twaddle, and Senators Inhofes abandoning reason... Nevertheless, we were/are fortunate to have had Carl Sagan, Bill Nye, Michio Kaku, and to some extent Brian Greene to help popularize science in that span.As to why we should continue to endure pseudo-science nonsense, Gardner puts it well:By all means let the Don Quixotes of science be heard. But let them be heard in a manner befitting their position on the spectrum of unorthodoxy, and let that position be determined by those who,alone are qualified to do so.Required reading for all skeptics."
23,0486203948,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47975-robu-sensei,3,"In this pioneering work of skepticism, Martin Gardner, best known as the Mathematical Games columnist for Scientific American, discusses a vast array of pseudoscientific beliefs ranging from silly but harmless to downright evil and dangerous.Frankly, I was slightly surprised that this book is considered a classic in the skeptical literature. Perhaps it was the first of its kind; perhaps the author was taking some risks denouncing popular pseudoscience so baldly during the 1950s. Though he does a fine job describing the cranks and charlatans of that era, Gardner offers comparatively little analysis, i.e., explaining why these ideas are nonscientific. Not that he never gives such explanations, but he doesn't go to the depth that, say the Great Randi or Michael Shermer do in their books on general skepticism.On the other hand, his warning signs that identify cranks are a valuable addition to the treasury of skeptics' reference lists, including Carl Sagan's Baloney Detection Kit (from The Demon-haunted World) and Isaac Asimov's Six Security Beliefs. Also of interest is to compare the frontiers of science, and pseudoscience, at the time of publication with the present day. For example, Gardner cites the expansion of the universe as an example of a genuinely scientific idea still under debate (!!). Some popular present-day crazy beliefs (read: Scientology) were just getting started then, and many of the most worrisome fads of that time are now practically unheard of."
24,0486203948,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18293816-bill-leach,4,"In this book, written in 1952 and updated in 1957, Gardner examines pseudo-science and the many strange movements that developed in the late 1800's and early twentieth century. While Gardner cautions that the ideas of some earlier scientists were rejected by the scientific community but turned out to be valid, he makes it clear that most of the ""modern"" fads are driven by cranks and have no likelihood of validity. The first chapter reviewing the characteristics of pseudo-science is quite entertaining and very much worth reading.Twenty-five subsequent chapters cover many of the fads and fallacies of the times, including flat earthers, flying saucers, dowsing, Atlantis, the Great Pyramid, and ESP. While many of these seem to have disappeared, there are many that still live on perhaps even stronger today. Examples would be homeopathy, osteopathy which evolved into chiropracty, dianetics which evolved into scientology, and the never ending efforts of the religious to refute the science (especially evolution and geology) that conflicts with their teachings. Food fads are stronger than ever - possibly fueling by electronic communication. It is interesting to compare pseudo-science at the middle of the twentieth century to today. It seems that it is just as prevalent. While science has advanced significantly since then, it is not clear that it has had any impact on pseudo-science. Wonder cures seem as prevalent today as then. Earlier, there seemed to be more movements to form organizations around these ideas - that is less so today, probably because electronic communication allows social groups to form without the need for a formal organization."
25,0486203948,http://goodreads.com/user/show/92292-jlawrence,4,"Good, clean, fun debunking. Part of the enjoyment is the outlandishness of some of the theories debunked -- for instance, genius bees from Mars flying UFOs! Or two kinds of tiny creatures who live in our brains and make us creative and logical (these are the Menorgs) or disorganized (the Disorgs) -- yes, the guy who came up with the following had followers and was the inventor of the passenger airplane to boot! Gardner obviously enjoys when the pseudoscience he punctures is unintentionally hilarious. But it's also enlightening to see Gardner essay and attack certain movements that are still with us -- the book was written in the 50s -- especially Dianetics (just newly born then, the aliens hadn't been introduced yet) and the anti-evolution propaganda of the time."
26,0486203948,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2379275-greg,4,"Over 50 years old and still fantastic reading. Interesting not just for what it says but for what it doesn't say. The section on crank medicien has homeopathy naturopathy (both of which could have been written last year) chirporactic and osteopathy, the later two now being a little more respectable, osteopathy having almost totally thrown off the pseudoscience and magical thinking and many chiropractic practitioners having done the sameThere is a section on dianetics, which was pretty new at the time and ends with the comment that the fad seems to have passed and that Hubbard is brokem but is trying a new thing that Hubbard calls ""Scientology"""
27,0486203948,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8819277-bill,4,"In 1957, Martin Gardner wrote a book debunking just about every major pseudoscience cluttering popular culture. Over 50 years later, his analysis of dianetics, UFOs, ESP, etc. are as cogent or moreso as they were during the Eisenhower administration. He lays out the modus operandi of the crank/'misunderstood genius' in clear unmistakable terms.His first and last chapters urge that America do a better job in educating people in the sciences so that they are not conned by these scams, and that press and publishers stop printing so much hokum. He was likely disappointed by the internet when he passed away in 2010."
28,0486203948,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15717830-george-anderson,5,"I noted Martine Gardner's death this month at the age of 95. He first published this book in 1952 and I have reread this book many times over the years as well as given away copies to friends. Basically, he managed to capture what he thought were the biggest scams against reason and science. In 2011 we are still watching a cycle of the same subjects. I have read much of what Mr. Gardner wrote over the years and greatly appreciated his efforts at presenting whatever caught his interest- which was a lot.
