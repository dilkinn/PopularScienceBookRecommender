0,0241304849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3536004-jenna,5,"I don't think it's possible for Michio Kaku to write a book that I don't absolutely love. Dark matter, antimatter, space travel, black holes, laser-propelled nanoships, quantum physics. String theory!! What is there not to love?? Much of this book is speculation and yet as always with Mr. Kaku's books, I learned quite a lot. He uses physics to speculate where we might be in the future, both near and far. He discusses inter-planetary travel and terra-forming other planets, not just in our own solar system but beyond. He discusses the future of our earth, our solar system, our galaxy, the universe. How might an advanced Type IV civilization survive the Big Crunch, when our universe collapses? How can we apply String Theory to the notion of a multiverse and the possibility of leaving this universe for another younger one? Before that happens, how might we seed this universe with intelligent life, becoming pure energy beings in the process and darting about from star to star?These and so many other topics are discussed and speculated upon in The Future of Humanity. Anyone interested in astrophysics, technology, or just the future should find this book fascinating. At times it almost seems like science fiction, and so I think any sci-fi lovers who tend to not read non-fiction might even love this book.As Michio Kaku says, if we don't destroy ourselves in our transition from a Level 0 to Level 1 civilization, the universe is ours to explore! We will learn to harness the energy of stars, entire galaxies, and black holes. We will transform ourselves into just about anything we wish. We will go where we want and create what we will. We will, in effect, become gods:
""Our destiny is to become the gods that we once feared and worshipped.""

Her Noodly Majesty laughs at any tangle of wires less complex than a Flying Spaghetti Monster... even if decent Pastafarians can’t spot Russell’s teapot, in which AI has stewed for decades."
2,0241304849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20408288-will-m,5,"  In other words, our destiny is to become the gods that we once feared and worshipped. Science will give us the means by which we can shape the universe in our image. The question is whether we will have the wisdom of Solomon to accompany this vast celestial power.  I haven't read a non-fiction novel in more than 2 years. I don't even remember how I stumbled upon this novel. I even tried searching my browsing history to try and figure things out but apparently I just randomly searched it on amazon kindle to check if it was on sale. I guess it would either be here on goodreads or on reddit considering I've been spending an unhealthy amount of time there lately.Astrophysics, Cosmology, Terraforming, Science Fiction, or anything about Space you can throw at me and I will catch it with utmost eagerness. These topics have been a huge interest of mine ever since and whilst I don't dwell much on it or try to really dig deep and learn the stuff, I am keen to slowly learn the stuff. I never hated Physics, in fact, I actually enjoyed it but not enough to really consider having a future in astrophysics. My love for Chemistry and Biology prevailed and in result here I am, about to start my second year in medicine in a few weeks. Regrets? Not really, but books like this really make me rethink my life decisions even by a little bit.I am beyond grateful for discovering this book. I was supposed to read a Sci-Fi novel about Space but ended up choosing this instead. Another major factor was that it was readily available in my local bookstore, in hardcover, so I grabbed it right away. Never in my life have I looked forward to reading a non-fiction book. Even Stephen King's On Writing took me a few days to read (4 I think?) but this barely made 3 days. If it wasn't for my tooth extraction and post-op pain, I would've devoured this in a day. I lost track of time and my attention span suddenly was amazing while reading this novel. I haven't experienced this in years. Michio Kaku tackled on multiple important topics in this novel. As the title says, it's major focus lie on Terraforming, Interstellar travel, theories on the universe, theories on physics and the likes, and well, the future of humanity. Don't we all love a good Sci-Fi book, movie, or TV Series here and there? Well, this novel briefly yet successfully explains the rationale regarding most of the Sci-Fi things you've encountered. You see, Science Fiction, while fiction, is an author's way of depicting what could happen in the future. While not all of them are plausible or scientifically correct, some if not most of them are actually possible. I will not discuss anything in detail or at all in this review cause most of the topics are briefly discussed and I don't wanna be a spoiler to anyone. If you're familiar with The Flash, Dark Matter, and well, most of the books, movies, and TV series out there about time travel and space, this novel explains what happens when you mess with the universe. I was most impressed with how he explained the multiverse, and how it was actually at parr with The Flash/DC's explanation. Well, DC is known to be heavily Science-inclined as compared to Marvel and I'm glad that they didn't get it wrong this time. I am also fascinated with the theories of what could happen in the future. I'm glad he tackled on possible fates for the universe and not just humanity itself. I didn't know most of the projects out there today and I am fascinated and interested to know more about them.The problem with not reading much Science Non-Fiction novels is that I'm not sure how good this novel actually is, especially for voracious readers of the genre and most especially of those in the academe and scientists. I may not be the best source to know if this novel is reliable scientifically, but I can say that the author provided adequate explanations to strengthen his claims. I have yet to read the Elon Musk book out 3 years ago that is still sitting on my shelf collecting dusk with no acceptable reason why. While I am not the biggest fan of Mars (thanks to my hatred for John Carter of Mars when I was younger), I am immensely interested in Terraforming. I do believe that we will achieve it in the near future with billionaires and scientists working on it. It's also great how near the end of the novel, String Theory was heavily discussed. I used to be addicted to The Big Bang Theory and how Sheldon Cooper chose String Theory as his main focus of study. I vaguely remember a character said that it's sad that Sheldon chose a field where it's well, a dead end. It was Leonard I think? I'm not sure but it's great how I was finally introduced to it aside from the vague things I got from The Big Bang Theory. Since I've rekindled my love for this genre, I will read more on it. In fact, I've already ordered some books regarding Moon exploration, terraforming, and other books of this amazing author.5/5 Stars. I'm sure this review is not doing this novel justice but this is one of my most utmost and highest recommendations ever. Well, before deciding to read it, if you aren't really interested in the topics that are clearly stated by the title and book description, then steer clear from this cause it's a bit heavy on the science. Might edit my review more if I remember to add something."
3,0241304849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/78485297-mario-the-lone-bookwolf,4,"The starting signal for the unlimited spread of the human species and the essence of science fiction.Please note that I put the original German text at the end of this review. Just if you might be interested.As it was often the case in its history, humanity is at the beginning of a new epoch. With the striking difference that there are for the first time no limits. The purpose of the colonization of space is well suited to illustrate the minuteness of the earth. It is not even a quantum state in relation to the known and unknown totality of things. No matter in which relation one sets the size of the solar system to the potential infinity. More and more dimensions of space open up if one puts it in a historical connection. From a small camp to a larger village to a small town over the city-state and the principality to states and finally the colonization. With the difference that this time no illiterate extremists, but educated experts form the spearhead of the expansion wave. Good, because the deluded ancestors would probably slaughter each other in the cabin fever or out of boredom due to lack of other victims on the travels to infinity.The Sci-Fi component boosts the nitro in the third part, in which the binding genetic adaptation of humans to new worlds of life is discussed. As seen in the first and second chapters with the terraforming of the Moon, Mars, and more distant star systems, adapting the environment is a mammoth task. And economics will have to be written larger in the universe to survive. Even if one has relatively pleasant rock planets in relation to the hostility of the universe and other worlds. The faster and easier way will be to adapt people to their worlds instead of turning everything into a monoculture of new earthes. Still the creation of methane-metabolizing, acid-resistant, and photosynthetic-living people may let sweat drips appear on the face of even the most dedicated bioengineer. But even immortality, dimensional portals and time travel seem to be only a simple question of development time.All eggs in a basket is so anachronistic. And given the diverse natural and self-made potentials for extinction events, it seems logical to go higher and further. Alone because even if one does not sympathize with humanity in general, at least to one's own children and children's children a plan B is owed. And in the face of potentially erratic experiments on Earth, climate collapse, volcanic eruptions, comical catastrophes, alien invasions, financial crises, infertility epidemics and consorts, time is hard.Bad enough that humanity has easily overslept a few thousand years of technological development. Thanks to fanaticism and backlashes. What hypothetically implies that in the best chase scenario humanity could technologically be at the level of the year 7018 or even 12018. It may be, in a parallel world. Even now, in the long-delayed step towards the stars, the state is slowing down in the form of the cancellation of subsidies, space programs and a lack of funding of young talents. In Europe and North America, private companies are entering this empty space, while in China and India, state space programs shed light on the ignorance of the West. Maybe the last ones may be the first in a philosophical sense. But being so ignorant and destructive with the key factor of the future is a disgrace to the West.Moreover, because the supremacy has existed 50 years ago for strategic military reasons to the enforcement of mutually assured destruction, first strike concepts, megadeath, and similar confusions. And since then was dismantled because of the lack of necessity of a third world war. Although these are not a few thousand years lost as in general human development, it is still half a century of wasted potential.Kaku sees himself standing on the shoulders of two groups of titans. Once the theoretical basis in the form of scientists and on the other side, the visionary power of creative minds such as writers, filmmakers and humanities scholars. One would have to search with the magnifying glass to find a forgotten Sci-Fi trope that is not mentioned in the book. Ok, maybe except aliens and interstellar wars. But to get to know the number of concepts, technologies, drives, sciences, etc., some Sci-Fi novels are needed otherwise.So Kaku drives the imagination and fantasy of young professionals from both sectors. Help with finding ideas and brainstorming for new books, films and video games, which arouse first interest in research and science in millions. And impulses and food for thought for aspiring researchers.Futurism comes to its full potential if additional facts from Kaku's other works are included in the considerations and a few bits from encyclopedias are included. The scenario can be compared with ""Physics of the Future"" to be able to make conservative appraisals for the 21st century. If one looks into the distance, one gets into the hypotheses of his works ""The Future of the Mind"" and ""Physics of the Impossible."" Both, the incomprehensibility of human consciousness and the definition of feasibility, may lose the nimbus of impracticability over time.This opens up the space for all thought buildings and utopias. Only the latest scientific findings prove our enormous lack of knowledge. In particular, the various branches of physics, but also anomalies observed in animals, plants and even elements with ever more excellent measuring and observation techniques. Not a door opens behind every supposedly answered question, but on the contrary, more new mysteries are revealed.Even if one day we had explored all the dimensions, layers, and interactions of our universe, it would be possible to jump into unknown spheres at any time. With entirely different blueprints of reality, perception and the laws of nature, so that exploration can begin again at zero. A nice idea.Der Startschuss zur grenzenlosen Ausbreitung der menschlichen Spezies und die Essenz der Science FictionWie schon oft in ihrer Geschichte steht die Menschheit am Anfang einer neuen Epoche. Mit dem eklatanten Unterschied, dass es das erste Mal keine Grenzen mehr gibt. Das Vorhaben der Allkolonialiserung eignet sich gut zur Veranschaulichung der Winzigkeit der Erde. Sie ist nicht einmal ein Quantenzustand in Relation zu der bekannten und unbekannten Gesamtheit der Dinge. Egal, in welche Relation man die Größe des Sonnensystems zu der potentiellen Unendlichkeit setzt. Immer neue Dimensionen von Weite tun sich auf, wenn man es in eine geschichtliche Relation setzt. Aus einem kleinen Lager zu einem größeren Dorf in eine kleine Stadt über den Stadtstaat und das Fürstentum zu Staaten und schließlich der Kolonialisierung. Mit dem Unterschied, dass diesmal keine analphabetischen Extremisten, sondern gebildete Experten die Speerspitze der Expansionswelle bilden. Gut, weil sich die verblendeten Vorfahren auf den Reisen in die Unendlichkeit mangels anderer Opfer wahrscheinlich im Lagerkoller oder aus Langeweile gegenseitig abschlachten würden.Den Nitroboost zündet die Sci Fi Komponente ab dem dritten Kapital, in dem die verbindliche genetische Adaptierung der Menschen auf neue Lebenswelten angeschnitten wird. Wie man im ersten und zweiten Kapitel anhand der Terraformung von Mond, Mars und entfernteren Sternensystemen gesehen hat, ist die Anpassung der Umwelt eine Mammutaufgabe. Und Ökonomie wird im All noch größer geschrieben werden müssen, um zu bestehen. Selbst wenn man, in Relation zur Lebensfeindlichkeit des Alls und anderer Welten, relativ friedliche Gesteinsplaneten hat. Der schnellere und einfachere Weg wird eine Anpassung der Menschen an ihre Lebenswelten sein, anstatt alles immer zu einer Monokultur von neuen Erden zu verwandeln. Noch mag die Erschaffung von Methan metabolisierenden, Säure resistenten und von Photosynthese lebenden Menschen selbst dem engagiertesten Bioingenieur Schweißtropfen auf die Stirn treiben. Aber selbst Unsterblichkeit, Dimensionsportale und Zeitreisen scheinen angesichts dessen auch nur mehr eine nüchterne Frage der Entwicklungszeit zu sein.Alle Eier in einem Korb ist so anachronistisch. Und angesichts der diversen natürlichen und selbst gemachten Potentiale für Extinktionsereignisse scheint es logisch, höher und weiter zu streben. Allein weil man, selbst wenn man mit der Menschheit im allgemeinen nicht sympathisieren sollte, zumindest den eigenen Kindern und Kindeskindern einen Plan B schuldet. Und angesichts von potentiell schief gehenden Experimenten auf Erden, Klimakollaps, Vulkanausbrüchen, komischen Katastrophen, Alieninvasionen, Finanzkrisen, Unfruchtbarkeitsepidemien und Konsorten tut Zeit Not. Schlimm genug, dass die Menschheit locker ein paar Tausend Jahre technologischer Entwicklung verschlafen hat. Fanatismus und Backlashs sei es gedankt. Was hypothetisch im best Chase Szenario im Umkehrschluss bedeutet, dass die Menschheit technologisch auf dem Stand des Jahres 7018 oder gar 12018 sein könnte. Es, in einer Parallelwelt vielleicht ist. Selbst jetzt, im lange verzögerten Schritt zu den Sternen, bremst der Staat in Form der Streichung von Subventionen, Raumfahrtprogrammen und mangelnder Nachwuchsförderung. In Europa und Nordamerika springen private Firmen in die geschlagene Bresche, während in China und Indien staatliche Raumfahrtprogramme Licht auf die Ignoranz des Westens werfen. Vielleicht mögen die Letzen rein philophisch betrachtet die Ersten sein. Aber im Schlüsselfaktor der Zukunft derart ignorant und destruktiv zu sein ist eine Schande für den Westen. Noch dazu, weil die Vorherrschaft vor 50 Jahren aus militärstrategischen Gründen zur Durchsetzung von mutual assured destruction, Erstschlagskonzepten, Megatoten und ähnlichen Verwirrtheiten bestanden hat. Und seitdem aus mangelnder Notwendigkeit eines dritten Weltkriegs demontiert wurde. Das sind zwar keine paar Tausend verlorenen Jahre wie bei der menschlichen Entwicklung, aber trotzdem ein halbes Jahrhundert verschwendeten Potentials.Kaku sieht sich auf den Schultern zweiter Gruppen von Titanen stehen. Einmal die theoretische Grundlage in Form der Wissenschaftlicher und auf der anderen Seite die visionäre Kraft von kreativen Köpfen wie Schriftstellern, Filmemachern und Geisteswissenschaftlern. Man müsste schon mit der Lupe suchen, um eine vergessene Sci Fi Trope zu finden, die nicht Erwähnung findet. Ok, Aliens und interstellare Kriege vielleicht einmal ausgenommen. Aber um die Menge an Konzepten, Technologien, Antrieben, Wissenschaften, usw kennen zu lernen, sind sonst einige Sci Fi Romane vonnöten. So treibt Kaku die Imagination und Fantasie von Nachwuchskräften aus beiden Sektoren an. Inspiration und Ideenfindung für neue Bücher, Filme und Videospiele, die in Millionen erst das Interesse für Forschung und Wissenschaft wecken. Und Impulse und Denkanstöße für angehende Forscher. Zur vollen Entfaltung kommt der Futurismus, wenn man ergänzend Fakten aus Kakus anderen Werken in die Überlegungen mit einfließen lässt und noch eine Prise Enzyklopädien darüber streut. Das Szenario kann etwa für dieses Jahrhundert mit ""Der Physik der Zukunft"" verglichen werden, um konservativ Kolportagen über das 21 Jahrhundert anstellen zu können. Richtet man den Blick in weitere Ferne, kommt man in die Hypothesen seiner Werke ""Die Physik des Bewusstseins"" sowie ""Der Physik des Unmöglichen."" Wobei beides im Laufe der Zeit den Nimbus der Undurchführbarkeit verlieren dürfte. Sowohl die Unverständlichkeit menschliches Bewusstsein als auch die Definition von Machbarkeit.Damit eröffnet sich der Raum für alle Gedankengebäude und Utopien. Alleine die jüngsten wissenschaftlichen Erkenntnisse belegen unser enormes Unwissen. Insbesondere die diversen Teilbereiche der Physik, aber auch die mit immer feineren Mess- und Beobachtungstechniken beobachteten Anomalien in Tieren, Pflanzen, ja selbst schlichten Elementen. Nicht eine Tür öffnet sich hinter jeder vermeintlich beantworteten Frage, sondern es werden im Gegenteil mehr neue Mysterien offenbart.Selbst wenn wir eines Tages alle Dimensionen, Schichten und Wechselwirkungen unseres Universums erforscht haben sollten, könnte sich jederzeit eine Sprungmöglichkeit in unbekannte Sphären öffnen. Mit gänzlich anderen Bauplänen der Realität, der Wahrnehmung und der Naturgesetze, so dass bei der Erforschung wieder bei Null begonnnen werden darf. Eine schöne Vorstellung."

The word lunatic comes from luna, the Latin word for moon."" (Kindle Locations 758-759).""Since the composition of the moon is so similar to Earth’s, the truth may be that mining the interior of the moon is only useful if you are building cities on the moon. It is probably too expensive to bring moon rock back to Earth if it only offers what we already have.""(Kindle Locations 787-789). ""What would happen if you took off your space suit on the moon?

5,0241304849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32383826-kristy-k,4,"This is utterly fascinating and written in a way that was easy to understand. Kaku mixes science with fiction (pulled from pop culture, books, etc) in order to explain what could or couldn’t happen in the future. I was surprised how easy it was to grasp the ideas and loved the examples he gives. His love of science is evident in his writing and very contagious. I have another book of his that I’ve been hesitant to start (I was afraid it’d be over my head), but after reading this I’m eager to dive into it. Highly highly recommend!"
6,0241304849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8101737-peter-tillman,2,"I spent a couple of hours skimming and scanning Prof. Kaku's latest book, and I'm giving up on it. I'm not quite sure why I find his writing style so profoundly irritating. His information is generally correct -- although other reviewers call him out for some bloopers, which I didn't see. I guess it's because his grand ideas of the future of humanity just seem, well, tired and old-hat. He can take something that should be really cool, like the chances of some future civilization developing faster-than-light travel, and make it sound dull. Mind, this may just be me. Lots of other people like the book. But I've tried Kaku's stuff in the past and had similar reactions. So I think I'm just allergic to his writing style. Oh, well. 1.5 stars, courtesy round-up. Your mileage may vary!Emma Sea's neat review has some telling quotes that might give you the flavor of the book: https://www.goodreads.com/review/show..."
7,0241304849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10499865-jack-chaucer,5,"This book is an amazing trip through the universe and beyond, which apparently could happen some distant day. From colonizing Mars to one day laser-porting our consciousness to distant galaxies at the speed of light, the possibilities dreamed up by science fiction writers could become reality, and even be surpassed, if humans can find a way to get out of our own way. Well-written, thoroughly researched and accessible to the average reader, this book will expand minds about what's possible and hopefully inspire action."

Does this mean every time I buy a book on Amazon I am indirectly contributing to space exploration? I like that idea.Just be warned there are a lot of sci fi books and movies mentioned (with spoilers) with the author showing a notable fondness for Star Trek and Isaac Asimov. I understand why he included these references but to be honest at times these references got a bit much.I also found the writing a little inconsistent, going from light and breezy to tackling quite complex theoretical physics, but at no point did I want to stop reading it.My favourite sections were science history, biotechnology and current astrophysics discoveries and laser nanoships.The last 60 pages or so dealt with string theory and try as I may my small brain still struggle to grasp the concept of a 10-dimensional multiverse.This is a meticulous outline of “What If” scenarios grounded in past and current space developments. It was interesting, fun and I definitely learned a few things along the way.Recommended"
9,0241304849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91772720-carrie,5,"4.5 rounded ⬆This is a speculative vision of the future based on current scientific understanding and the likelihood of making science fiction a reality. This book is highly informative and intriguing. Kaku uses current physics theories and theoretical understandings to discuss the possibility of becoming a multi-planetary species and achieving interstellar travel. The author then describes what advances in both scientific understanding and technology is needed to accomplish these feats.The first part of the book did start to feel bogged down as Kaku discussed traveling to many objects in the solar system. However, I had difficulty putting this book down during Part 2 and Part 3, where he discussed traveling outside our solar system.As a science geek and science fiction lover, the topics discussed were fascinating. My reading list got longer, as Kaku mentioned several science fiction stories throughout to help the reader bridge physics and science fiction. Note, however, that there are several places in the book that a reader that is notoverly family with physics concepts may be lost. The section of genetically engineering humans for advanced survival and immorality was both captivating and terrifying at the same time. I wish that Kaku spent more time discussing the ethical and moral dilemmas involved in these scientific advances. "
10,0241304849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6837622-yoly,3,"Well, that was awkward. With Michio Kaku as the author, I was expecting a book more about facts, but I ended up reading a book where the author mixes some bits of science with tons of “some day we…” and TONS of movies and books spoilers :) I think the book was OK, I guess I was expecting something different."

13,0241304849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5686119-book,4,"The Future of Humanity: Terraforming Mars, Interstellar Travel, Immortality, and Our Destiny Beyond Earth by Michio Kaku“The Future of Humanity” is an awe-inspiring exploration of the pioneers who have the energy, vision, and the resources to change the fate of humanity. He also analyzes the advance in technology that will make it possible to leave the Earth and settle elsewhere. Cofounder of string field theory, best-selling author and professor of theoretical physics at the City University of New York, Dr. Michio Kaku takes the reader on a unique journey beyond Earth. This splendid 352-page book includes fourteen chapters broken out by the following three parts: I. Leaving the Earth, II. Voyage to the Stars, and III. Life in the Universe.Positives:1.	A Kaku trademark, great science writing for the general public. Informative, interesting and fun to read.2.	The fascinating topic of the future of humanity in the hands of an expert.3.	Excellent format. The book is broken out logically and in chronological order of future events. Also, each chapter is introduced by chapter-appropriate quotes.4.	An excellent introduction that clearly states the main purpose of the book. “In this book, I will describe the technologies that will take us even farther as we explore the planets and the stars. In part 1, we will discuss the effort to create a permanent moon base and to colonize and terraform Mars. To do this, we will have to exploit the fourth wave of science, which consists of artificial intelligence, nanotechnology, and biotechnology.”5.	Interesting factoids throughout. “The V-2 set a number of world records, shattering all past achievements in terms of speed and range for a rocket. It was the first long-range guided ballistic missile. It was the first rocket to break the sound barrier. And most impressively, it was the first rocket ever to leave the boundary of the atmosphere and enter outer space.”6.	Thought-provoking philosophy. “Since science is the engine of prosperity, nations that turn their backs on science and technology eventually enter a downward spiral.”7.	Excellent look at the pioneers with deep pockets and their dreams for humanity. “Today, it is not the private fortunes of the members of the Baltimore Gun Club fueling this new space race but the checkbooks of moguls like Jeff Bezos. Instead of waiting for NASA to give him permission to build rockets and a launchpad with taxpayer dollars, he founded his own company, Blue Origin, and is building them himself, with his own pocket money.”8.	For the love of astronomy. “Asteroids, in some sense, are like flying gold mines in outer space. For example, in July 2015, one came within a million miles of Earth, or about four times the distance from the Earth to the moon. It was about nine hundred meters (or about three thousand feet) across and was estimated to contain ninety million tons of platinum in its core, worth $5.4 trillion.”9.	Discusses what it will take to live on Mars. “But settlers would have to get used to the gravity on Mars, which is only 40 percent of the gravity on Earth, and, as on the moon, they would have to exercise vigorously to avoid muscle and bone loss.”10.	Discusses potential life-supporting venues besides the planets. “Perhaps the most intriguing of all is Europa, one of the original moons discovered by Galileo. Europa, like some of the other moons of the gas giants, is covered with a thick layer of ice.”11.	Such discussions are not possible without the great contributions from Einstein. “Albert Einstein, recognizing that Newton’s laws could be flawed, showed that Mercury’s orbit could be explained by an entirely new effect, the warping of space-time according to his theory of relativity.)”12.	Robots in space, oh my. “The next push for self-replicating robots came in 1980, when NASA spearheaded a study called Advanced Automation for Space Missions. The study report concluded that self-replicating robots would be crucial to building lunar settlements and identified at least three types of robots that would be needed. Mining robots would collect basic raw materials, construction robots would melt and refine the materials and assemble new parts, and repair robots would mend and maintain themselves and their colleagues without human intervention.”13.	One of the joys of reading Kaku are the numerous references to popular science fiction movies that help readers understand science topics. Movies like Passengers, Interstellar, Arrival and of course the classic 2001 get a lot of love.14.	Discusses a variety of types of spaceships. “The ramjet fusion rocket is another enticing concept. It would look like a giant ice cream cone and would scoop up hydrogen gas in interstellar space, then concentrate it in a fusion reactor to generate energy. Like a jet or a cruise missile, the ramjet rocket would be quite economical. Because jets gulp ordinary air, they do not have to carry their own oxidizer, which reduces cost. Since there is an unlimited amount of hydrogen gas in space for fuel, the spaceship should be able to accelerate forever. As with the solar sail, the engine’s specific impulse is infinite.”15.	Did somebody say wormholes? “In conclusion, negative energy does exist, and if enough negative energy could somehow be collected, we could, in principle, create a wormhole machine or a warp drive engine, fulfilling some of the wildest fantasies of science fiction.”16.	The fascinating topic of aging and immortality. “In fact, there is an influx of Silicon Valley entrepreneurs investing millions to defeat the aging process. Not content to wire up the world, their next goal is to live forever. Sergey Brin, the cofounder of Google, hopes to do nothing less than “cure death.””17.	The quest to find extraterrestrial life. “A new branch of science has recently been born, called exobiology, to study life on distant worlds with ecosystems different from those found on Earth. So far, exobiologists have had difficulty trying to find a path to creating life-forms that are not based on the carbon chemistry that gives us rich and diverse molecules.”18.	A look at the Kardashev scale of civilizations. “His ranking was as follows: 1. A Type I civilization utilizes all the energy of the sunlight that falls on that planet. 2. A Type II civilization utilizes all the energy its sun produces. 3. A Type III civilization utilizes the energy of an entire galaxy.”19.	The search for the theory of everything. “What theory can unify general relativity and the quantum theory at the Planck energy? Einstein spent the last thirty years of his life chasing after a “theory of everything” that could allow him to “read the mind of God,” but he failed. This remains one of the biggest questions facing modern physics.”20.	The three possibilities for the ultimate fate of the universe. “So my point of view combines both the Copernican and anthropic principle. I believe that our universe is not special, as in the Copernican principle, except for two features: that it is very stable and that it is compatible with life as we know it. So instead of having an infinite number of parallel universes floating in the Nirvana of hyperspace, most of them are unstable, and perhaps only a handful of them survive to create life like ours.”Negatives:1.	I would have preferred a better laid out book. I would have added timelines, highlight factoids, and take advantage of linking capability in eBooks. Time to take these books to another level.2.	Limited visual supplementary material for such a great narrative. 3.	Honestly, how many readers even at its most basic will truly understand string theory?4.	Let’s be honest it’s hard to live up to the The Future of the Mind. 5.	In order to reach a broader audience, depth pays a price. In summary, I really enjoyed this book! Kaku is the tour guide you want to teach us about the future of humanity. This is what popular science writing should all be about, inspiring minds to dream big while keeping us grounded in sound science. What makes this book a treat to read is the combination of Kaku’s mastery of the topic, his enthusiasm, his ability to convey complex topics in an accessible manner, and providing readers with excellent examples from popular science fiction movies. Some shortcomings aside, I highly recommend it!Further recommendations: “The Future of the Mind” and “Physics of the Future” by the same author, “Astrophysics for People in a Hurry” by Neil deGrasse Tyson, “Heavens on Earth” by Michael Shermer, “Immortality” by Stephen Cave, “Cosmos” Carl Sagan, “The Big Picture” Sean Carroll, “A Universe From Nothing” by Lawrence Krauss, “The Grand Design” by Stephen Hawking, “The Elegant Universe” by Brian Greene, and “Wonders of the Solar System” and “Wonders of the Universe” by Brian Cox."

I found some of the information incredibly basic so I wouldn't necessarily recommend this book to readers with a lot of science background. However, I think this will appeal to readers with a fairly simple understanding of space who are interested in learning more about the topic."

16,0241304849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36464297-gorab-jain,5,"A science non-fiction based on space exploration. Picked this thinking it would be ""speculative"" non-fiction… and was curious to know how can travelling to distant starts be categorized as non-fiction.This turned out way more than anticipated.Structured pretty well. Starts with the history, on how the first rocket was conceptually conceived and what are the challenges, financial and ethical, for the space program.From setting feet to moon, the pace picks up and we're talking about mining resources from asteroids. A bible for anyone writing a sci-fi based on Mars or Moon [Not for Andy Weir who has utilized both these themes :)]Details on exoplanets, Kuiper belt, habitation on Mars… on building star-ship, various technologies available and scientific details on the upcoming feasibility and the challenges faced. Building robots in space and eventually leading way to von Neumann machines (capable of replicating themselves). Technological advances to explore human frailties and ""fixing"" them to attain conscious immortality, delving into trans-humanism.Then there are speculations about advanced civilizations of higher order and intelligence, existing in higher dimensions. The most fascinating part was the details on connecting the theory of relativity with quantum mechanics and attempt to fill that gap using string theory. Learnt many new concepts and terminologies from this book.The best thing is that EACH and EVERY fancy futuristic travel aspect is scientifically explained with logical details. [On top of it I was reading a Murakami in parallel where NOTHING has any logic whatsoever!]Recommended: For science enthusiasts, for readers who are looking for something to follow up Cosmos - this is the perfect choice."
17,0241304849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/169481-justin,4,"Theoretical physicist Michio Kaku is at his best (at least for layman) when his enthusiasm for creative science, science fiction, and the edges of our knowledge blend into a surprisingly accessible read. That approach comes through much of The Future of Humanity, where his speculative science is sometimes quite compatible with speculative fiction.This one's a little different from Hyperspace; there's less of Kaku's own work and more of his reporting on the work of others, whether as historical overviews or updates on contemporaries. When the book drags, which isn't often, it's because it bogs down in reportage.The ideas here are fun, even if the premise (we have to leave earth or face extinction) is bleak. Some of the science never quite gets there, and some of the timeline estimates feel unfounded (maybe they aren't, but some of them are more clearly explained). Figuring out how to travel the stars feels like an exercise in fiction with Kaku's easy approach to physics, but understanding that these ideas are (mostly) actual considerations adds an odd feeling to it.I imagine this one's as good a read for fans of Arrival or Asimov as it is for fans of Brian Greene. Those looking for harder, more detailed science won't find it here, but will likely still find Kaku's musings engaging.[Based on a NetGalley edition.]"
18,0241304849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16896341-sotiris-makrygiannis,3,"I love Dr Strangelove Mr Kaku :) but this book is proof of the trend observed with Pinker: take a popular topic, research all the news in the last 10 years and make a book about it. Well is good but his youtube videos are even better. Kaku will be remembered for his sweet voice saying: ""in the future"" and that what he is, a dreamer. "
19,0241304849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9135598-casey-wheeler,4,"I received a free Kindle copy of The Future of Humanity by Michio Kaku courtesy of Net Galley and Doubleday Books, the publisher. It was with the understanding that I would post a review to Net Galley, Goodreads, Amazon, Barnes and Noble and my nonfiction book review blog. I also posted it to my Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter and Google Plus pages.I requested this book as I have always had an interest in space and science and where we may go in the future.  This is the first book by Michio Kaku that I have read.The subtitle of this book ""Terraforming, Mars, Interstellar Travel, Immortality and Our Destiny Beyond Earth"" is a good description of the contents of the book. The author starts out describing what will eventually happen to the Earth using other solar systems as examples. He then launches into a number of topics dealing with the subject. The author's writing style is engaging making this an enjoyable read. While the author does project his thoughts on the subject, he also uses the thoughts and theories of several others. Some of his time frames for events are well documented while others are somewhat more nebulous.I recommend this book for anyone who is interested in ways that humanity can survive in the long-term (millions and billions of years). You will not be disappointed."
20,0241304849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17371264-lissa,5,There is really no need to summarize this book as the subtitle pretty much says it all. I will say that I found this book incredibly accessible and completely fascinating. I’m pretty sure I learned more about space travel in this one book than I have in the preceding years of my life. Kaku’s format of using straightforward language and pop-culture references causes this book to never be boring and for me to feel completely over confident in my knowledge of physics and astronomy. I received a digital ARC of this book through NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.

22,0241304849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5917740-nilesh,3,"This is a hastily written popular book with a catchy title but only with a host of rehashed ideas and no novel lines of thoughts or conclusions.The short book starts by excessively focusing on the latest developments in the space travel. For a book with such a wide scope, the initial chapters - that detail the cold war space race, NASA's history, Musk/Bezos' programs and many other technical details of where space travel is today - are wasted and a harbinger of the confusion that permeates all through the book. The author is talking about the future, and as a result, is expected to hedge any forecasts, but its the failure to define the objective that hurts the book the most.As we know, one day, our earth, solar system, galaxy and even the universe will end. The author's future of humanity is linked to how we deal with these catastrophes. For sure, there is some discussion about AI, transhumanism, genetically modified life-spans, a potential man+machine age or even man-made disastrous spirals (pollution, nuclear), but the discussions on these subjects are perfunctory and not even newspaper article length. The author completely skips how this could shape our social, economic or political lives. In their place, he has long discussions on scientific factors that would determine various scenarios for our galaxy, sun and the earth, while relatively short, speculative conclusions on the way humanity or post-human intelligence would escape it. While there is a lot to learn in the book for the uninitiated, most topics covered in the book have more exhaustive and purposeful discussions in other modern popular science books."

Well, I think physics is complex. I found his passion for the subject contagious, and I couldn’t read this book fast enough.Extinction of species is the norm not the exception. Earth has gone through five major extinction cycles, which has wiped out up to 90 percent of all lifeforms. When will the next event happen? How do we ensure our survival?Kaku explores these questions and what it would take for humans to inhabit other worlds, how space affects our bodies, and the role that AI could play in developing other planets.

26,0241304849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4739424-mal-warwick,5,"Climate change. The threat of thermonuclear war. Bioterrorism. Overpopulation. Is it any wonder that most Americans today are pessimistic about the future of the human race? In the face of all these (and so many other) existential threats to the survival of our civilization, who can blame us for wondering whether our grandchildren will live to see the 22nd century? Yet there are those who sail against the prevailing currents of thought and see a future that is endlessly bright. To this brave cadre of optimists we can now add physicist Michio Kaku, who peers hundreds of thousands of years into the future, envisioning human civilization spread throughout the galaxy in his dazzling new book, The Future of Humanity. Read this book, and he will take you on a journey from the moon and Mars to the multiverse.“Either we must leave the Earth or we will perish.”Professor Kaku’s prescription is unambiguous: “Either we must leave the Earth or we will perish. There is no other way.” In this judgment, he has a lot of company. The late Stephen Hawking and Elon Musk, for example, not to mention many other prominent scientists and technologists (and a handful of politicians) who see humanity’s future in the stars. Yet none of these individuals view the future through the rose-colored glasses of faith alone or science fantasy. Their conviction is grounded in solid scientific research. Kaku makes that overwhelmingly clear in his considered, step-by-step presentation of the steady progression of the human race, first back to the moon, Mars, and the asteroids; then to the moons of Jupiter and Saturn; and finally onward to the nearest stars, with stopovers on the comets that swarm by the millions in the vast Oort Cloud that surrounds the solar system. This is truly a journey from the moon and Mars to the multiverse.From the moon and Mars to the multiverseThe Future of Humanity is divided into four parts. In the first, Kaku takes us along to witness the establishment of a permanent base on the moon and the settlement and terraforming of Mars. In part two, we accompany him as humanity moves beyond the solar system to explore the nearby stars. Part three concerns the settlement of extrasolar planets, dwelling on the genetic changes that will be required for humans to adapt to the daunting conditions so likely to be found there.The author’s argument is easy to follow throughout most of his book. His explanations of scientific phenomena are remarkably clear, using an abundance of pithy similes and metaphors. Only in the final chapters when he attempts to explain string theory (his specialization) and the more fanciful imaginings of cosmologists does Professor Kaku’s language become opaque. String theory “contains an infinite number of parallel universes, called the multiverse, each one as valid as the next.” In ten dimensions.Ideas from the greats of science fictionScience fiction fans will encounter a wealth of familiar concepts, from the most mundane (mining the asteroids) to the most spectacular (uploading human consciousness and projecting it with lasers or gravity beams throughout the galaxy). In fact, Kaku makes frequent references to the work of such science fiction luminaries as Olaf Stapledon, Isaac Asimov, and Arthur C. Clarke. Yet, in this book alone, the author floats enough fascinating ideas to put a whole roomful of science fiction writers to shame. And there is no doubting his optimism: “Transhumanism, instead of being a branch of science fiction or a fringe movement, may become an essential part of our very existence.”About the authorMichio Kaku is a theoretical physicist who teaches at the City University of New York. He has made numerous appearances on television and in film, hosted a popular science program on radio, and written fifteen books, including several New York Times bestsellers."
27,0241304849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5469227-d-l-morrese,3,"Will humans colonize other worlds? Will they continue to evolve? Will they survive the inevitable destruction of Earth? These and other questions are posed and addressed in simple (perhaps overly simple) terms in this book. It's a serviceable primer to engage the imagination of kids and adults who may not have considered such questions before, but it's a bit short on details and long on generalities for readers who have. It also irritatingly panders to the common misunderstanding that technological advancement (and biological evolution toward intelligence) progresses inevitably, even predictably over time, which clearly is not the case. There are repeated instances of predictions about technologies we will have hundreds or thousands of years in the future, or about alien civilizations that are thousands of years more advanced than we are. I almost felt I was being talked down to while reading it."
28,0241304849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28482493-angus-mckeogh,4,"Love Kaku’s books about the weirdness of physics in our universe and the unusual applications that entails. Love the idea of our species heading off planet to maintain the species. There was a lengthy bit about genetics which demonstrated the silliness of the current “Non-GMO” fad; Kaku gives the facts, humans have been genetically modifying our food crops through selective breeding for more than 2,000 years (the prime example being corn which can no longer spread its own seed without human intervention). This was probably heading toward a 5-star review but got a little too speculative at the end (because of the subject) and wasn’t very relatable. But very entertaining nonetheless. Thoroughly enjoyed it."

I thoroughly enjoyed how in depth Kaku got, not just laying out the potential opportunities but also fully explaining the science behind the theories. Despite this heavily scientific approach, this book never felt boring or overwhelming. Even if some of the topics were a little far-fetched, it was nevertheless an intriguing and engaging read.—75,000 years ago there was a major volcanic eruption (Topa); considered the biggest eruption in the past 25 million years. Some scientists speculate only 2,000 humans remained and had to repopulate, which is why DNA between people even if they’re not related is surprisingly similarWhen you consider every single creature that has ever lived on the earth such as amoebas, plants, dinosaurs etc., you find that 99.9% have gone extinct, meaning the creatures and living things that are alive today are an extremely small sliver of all the living things that have ever lived on the planetOur earth has gone through 5 major extinction cycles in our history, in which up to 90% of the living species went extinct at a timeBecause our galaxy has 100 billion stars there may be as many as 20 billion Earth sized planets in the Milky Way galaxy. it’s estimated there is 2 billion trillion earth sized planets in the visible universe including galaxies outside our ownThere is actually gravity in space and the feeling/illusion of weightlessness is because everything falls at the same rate so astronauts are falling at the same rate as the spaceshipIn the future, we may use the moon as a gas station, because ice at the South Pole can be used to farm oxygen and hydrogen which are primary components of rocket fuel, and also rare earth metals found there as well which are also able to be made into fuel. Helium 3 is also expected to be on the moon, which can be used for Fusion reactors. There is also talk of finding platinum. All this raises the question of whether it’s legal to mine on the moon and if so who can stake a claim on itIf we built a living space on the moon, at first it would need to be sent supplies from Earth every few weeks. The astronauts could use Internet, cell phones etc. as normal once they set up the proper technology because the delay between earth and the moon is only one second. They could potentially farm oxygen from the soil and water from the ice caps. The bases may be built underground to protect from solar radiation. There will need to be large amounts of solar panels because a moon day lasts an Earth month, so there are 2 weeks of day followed by 2 weeks of nightYour blood boils in the vacuum of space because as pressure drops the boiling point of water also dropsAstroids contain iron, nickel, carbon & cobalt, as well as significant quantities of rare earth metals and valuable metals including irradium, platinum, and rodium. It is believed that we will eventually mine the astroid belt, and many entrepreneurs have already expressed interest in finding ways to do so. 12 astroids have already been identified as key targets for mining, because only a slight nudge to their orbit would bring them closer towards earth and the moon and able to enter into orbit, making mining them much more efficientElon musk‘s goal with space X is to reduce the cost of commercial space travel by 10x. He was the 1st to invent a reusable booster capsule module rather than discarding it after use. His ultimate goal is to make it to Mars. His goal is to send a manned mission to Mars by 2024. He envisions eventually the cost of sending someone to Mars will be $200,000/person round-tripIt only takes 3?days to get to the moon but 9 months to get to Mars. A round trip to Mars would take 2 years. Potential dangers during this deep space trip include excessive exposure to radiation, damage to the ship from solar flares or micro astroids, muscular atrophy from being in reduced gravity so long, and psychological side effectsNASA plans on having a manned mission arrive at Mars by 2033; this plan involves creating a lunar space station from which ships could go to Mars, rather than going directly to Mars like space XLike the moon, explorers on Mars would be able to harvest water, oxygen, and hydrogen from the permafrost and ice to serve as sources for water, oxygen, and fuel. The days on Mars are similar in length to days on earth, but the temperature is extremely cold, barely above the freezing point of water during the day and dropping drastically at night. Like the moon, the gravity is less so explorers would have to exercise daily to avoid muscular atrophy and loss of bone density. Mars has both water ice caps and dry ice/CO2 ice caps. The water ice caps stay consistent year round, but the dry ice caps fluctuate with the seasons and mostly evaporate in the summerFor Mars to become truly habitable, we would need to find a way to slowly heat the atmosphere so liquid water could flow on the surface, allowing for plants to grow outside of contained greenhouses. Terraforming mars is probably centuries away, and may be prohibitively costly. To artificially raise the temperature of the planet, we may inject water vapor and methane into the atmosphere to create a greenhouse effect, or send satellites into orbit over the ice caps to direct concentrated sunlight towards the caps to cause them to melt and release water vapor. Eventually, this warming process would become self-sustaining as well as increase the atmospheric pressure of mars. As plants grow and proliferate, dying plants will enrich the soil, and growing plants will add oxygen to the atmosphereMars cooled down slower than Earth did. Mars no longer has a molten core but rather a solid rock core, so it doesn’t have a magnetic field. This is one of the factors that accelerated Mars’s atmosphere loss. Also, the carbon dioxide is mostly trapped in the ground instead of proliferating in the atmosphere, causing a reverse greenhouse effectSome of the moons of the gas giants are also viewed as potential candidates for human coloniesThe gas giants are theorized to have a thick gaseous atmosphere, a cold liquid hydrogen ocean around the entire planet, and a small, solid hydrogen core because of the extreme pressures. Jupiter is surrounded by radiation, which causes Radio interference. The gravity of Jupiter actually helps protect the earth from being bombarded by astroids because it essentially serves as a vacuum cleanerTitan (a moon of Saturn) is a potential candidate for human colonization, but because it’s so far away it can’t have self-sustaining greenhouse effect, and the lakes of ethane Could combust if it got too hot. But it could be a source of fuel. And it’s one of the few places in our solar system where we would be able to go outside without a spacesuit because it has enough of an atmosphere that our blood wouldn’t boil/we wouldn’t be crushed (we’d still need an oxygen mask). Europa (a moon of Jupiter) has potential for microbial life in its ocean (which sits under the layer of ice that encircles the moon, and was made possible because of friction caused from the extreme tidal forces caused by Jupiter’s gravity)All the gas giants have rings, which are likely caused by moons that got too close to the planet being torn apart by the planet’s gravityTitan and the Kuiper belt would most likely serve as refueling stations or points from which to jump to the next star or planetGraphene/carbon nanotubes will likely be the material used to make infrastructure on other planets, because it’s immensely strong yet incredibly light. We’re not at a point yet where we can mass produce it, because even a small impurity can ruin it, but once we have the technology to do so, it’ll be the best material to use. It could even be used to create skin-tight, lightweight spacesuitsFor Interstellar and planetary colonization to be realistic, we would need automatons—robots with more intelligence than our current ones who can perform a wide variety of tasks such as building cities on planets and moons, which would be easier for a robot (doesn’t need a spacesuit, doesn’t get affected by radiation, isn’t limited by oxygen supply, etc)Getting robots to understand common sense has been extremely difficult and currently prevents them from fully perceiving and navigating the world. Currently robots need human intervention to do most tasks. Modern robots will likely be a combination of top down and bottom up learning; they will have some information already integrated into their systems but they will also have neural networks that will allow them to learn from repetition and gain common sense. Robots would also need to be self replicatingIon engines may make it possible for the trip to Mars to take 40 days rather than 9 monthsPotential energy sources for traveling at the speed of light include light sailing (propelling with lasers), nuclear energy (propelling with nuclear explosions), and antimatter energy. an antimatter rocket would have 100% energy efficiency, whereas nuclear explosion only has 1% because most of the Energy is wasted. However only a very small amount of anti-matter exists naturally, so we would have to manufacture it (currently extremely expensive). Storing the antimatter would be difficult because it would have to be stored in a trap that suspends it in a magnetic field so it’s not able to touch the edges of the container; if it touch the edges it would destroy the containerSomething that would help make getting materials into space much easier and more economical is creating a space elevator that stretches from the surface of the earth out above our atmosphere. Scientists predict that it is theoretically possible to do so, possibly even by 2035, but we would need to find a way to make enough strong enough Materials for this to be feasible. Ideally pure carbon nanotubes would be used, but right now it would be difficult to make as much as would be neededTo travel faster than light at warp speed, we need to find a way to make vast quantities of negative matter or negative energy. We’ve been able to make small amounts of negative energy, but we are nowhere close to producing the amount needed to even consider developing warp drivesSuspended animation/cryogenic freezing to allow longer voyages without needing generations of people to live on a spaceship is currently not possible. While other animals are able to survive in suspended animation because of the levels of glucose in their blood which prevents their blood from freezing, the amount of sugar needed is too high for humansTelomeres are part of our chromosomes that get shorter with aging; when they get too short the cells can no longer divide. If we can prevent that shortening from happening, it would increase our life span because our cells would be able to divide and replicate themselves longer. However, cancer operates in the same way and is essentially immortal, so that would be a riskIf we were able to identify exactly what parts of our genetic make up contribute to aging, we could alter our genes to expand our life expectancyAging is thought to be the accumulation of errors in our genetic make up over time, so if we can prevent those errors from happening because of deteriorating cell replication then we can slow down the aging processIf we were able to somehow make ourselves inmortal, or drastically increase our life expectancy, then we would likely have to deal with extreme overpopulation eventually. Before the Industrial Revolution, the human population of the earth was 300 million or less. It has now grown to 7.5 billion and is anticipated to increase by 1 billion every 12 years. It is estimated that there will be 11.2 billion people on the earth by 2100. However, others argued that our increase in population is slowly going down and will stabilize before we reach a level of overpopulationA primate has never been cloned. If we come to the point where human cloning is possible, it is likely that only a small percentage of the population would do so. It is also speculated that eventually we will find ways to modify our genes or enhance our bodies through cybernetics, but we will likely not take it so far that we drastically modify our appearance. Modifications would likely be improvements to existing issues (ex: eyesight) or ways to improve our social standing, rather than becoming creatures with giant heads and huge eyes and skinny bodies. Our use of cybernetics would prevent us from evolving that drastically. If we were to disperse in colonies across the galaxy, our genetic makeup would remain within 0.1% difference between colonies (same as between humans currently)We may in the next century or so develop ways to laser port our consciousness across the galaxy so our physical bodies could remain in place while our consciousness is able to move at the speed of light to visit other places by being ported it into an avatarEarth like planets need to be accompanied by large gaseous Jupiter like planets to clear out incoming astroids. They also need to be accompanied by a larger moon to stabilize their spin and trajectoryThe drake equation attempts to estimate the probability that we will make contact with intelligent life forms; however there is still a lot of unknowns that prevent us from having an accurate assessment from this equationIf there are intelligent beings on other planets, we can’t assume that they communicate vocally the same way we do. They might communicate through pheromones like bugs, or sonar like batsIntelligent life will likely follow the laws of evolution. An intelligent species will likely be descended from predators, so it will have forward facing eyes. They will also likely have opposable thumbs or some type of grasping appendage. They will also have some form of languageKardishev scale of civilizations: A type 1 civilization (planetary) uses all the energy of the sunlight that falls on the planet. Type 2 civilization (stellar) uses all the energy it’s sun produces. A type 3 civilization (galactic) uses the energy of an entire galaxy. We are currently a type 0.7 civilization because we’re not using the full energy of all the sunlight shining on our planet. We are about a century or two away from becoming a full type 1, and possibly A few thousand years from becoming a type 2. We might not become type 3 for 100,000 years or even up to 1 million because it requires a level of interstellar travel that we’re nowhere close to having. The energy measurements for each type just means and equivalent amount of energy, it doesn’t mean you have to be getting all your energy from the sun. Each next level of civilization is between 10 to 100 billion times more powerful than the previous typeA civilization that has reached type 2 is likely nearly immortal, and most of its energy generating machinery will likely be placed off planet because there will be so much energy being produced that it creates too much heat for the planet to be habitable. They will likely also harvest energy from their sun through a Dyson sphere and because of the vast quantities they are harvesting Will emit infrared radiationThere is another scale of civilization that is calculated based on the amount of information it consumes as proposed by Carl Sagan. Type A civilization consumes 1,000,000 bits of information. Type Z civilization consumes a 10^31 bits of information. We are a type H civilization. By this scale a type two civilization would be able to consume energy through widely distributed Dyson sphere, harvesting from astroids, developing super efficient nano technology, etc. and avoid giving up the levels of infrared radiation that would make it detectable to usOur first encounter with alien civilization will likely be a robotic self replicating probeString theory exists in 10 dimensions. It cancels out quantum corrections, basically meaning it cancels out the fact that quantum things like electrons and protons are able to be in multiple places at once. This quantum cancellation can only happen in 10 dimensions. The pairing for particles in string theory is sparticles, quarks are squarks, etc. String theory assumes an infinite number of universes (Multiverse). String theory says the universe was originally 10 dimensions, then for some reason the other 6 dimensions “curled up” leaving us with only 4 perceivable dimensionsDark matter was discovered because astrophysicist realized that the Milky Way was spinning 10 times faster than Newtonian physics would allow without flying apart, so they realize there must be some invisible thing adding all that extra mass to the galaxy. Dark matter is invisible, but it bends starlight so we’re able to detect it that way. Dark matter has gravity, but can’t be held/interact with matter in any way. It’s electrically neutral and only interacts with gravity. However we’ve never been able to officially prove that dark matter exist yet or create it ourselves in any way. Once we do, it will prove string theoryString theory is the only way would be able to do calculations about the quantum corrections needed for time travel, going through a wormhole, faster than light travel, etcThe universe is expected to eventually end in 1 of 3 ways: the big crunch, the big freeze, or the big rip. The big crunch is when the expansion of the universe slow down, stops, and reverses itself, eventually coalescing in a giant wad of superheated matter and possibly eventually turning into another big bang. For the big freeze, by the laws of entropy eventually the stars will stop shining, the sky will go black and temperature will reach absolute zero wherein matter nearly ceases to move. The big rip refers to the fact that the universe is exponentially expanding far faster than anticipated, and that distant galaxies will eventually speed away from us faster than the speed of light and disappear. Eventually our galaxy and solar system would be torn apart from this rapid expansion. The universe would end in an explosion, a singularity of infinite energyOur sun will exhaust its energy in about 5 billion years; it will expand into a red giant star which will essentially set the earth on fire, mountains will melt, oceans will boil, and the earth will be engulfed. After this, the sun will exhaust all its nuclear fuel and shrink and go cold as a white dwarf and then die as a dark dwarf star. In 4.8 billion years, the Milky Way and Andromeda galaxy’s will collide. There are two black holes will collide and merge and a new galaxy will eventually be formedDark energy is the energy of a vacuum. It acts like antigravity, and it pushes the universe apart. It is different than dark matter. The more the universe expands, the more dark energy there is, which makes the universe expand faster. About 69% of the matter/energy in the universe is contained in dark energy. Dark matter makes up 26%. Atoms of hydrogen and helium make up about 5%. And other higher elements that make up the earth, our bodies, etc. only make up 0.5%A possible way to overcome the eventual death of our universe is by becoming a type 4 civilization that harnesses extragalactic energy like dark energy and is able to reverse the big rip by creating a sphere in which dark energy reverses polarity so that inside the sphere The galaxies continue to survive normally while outside the sphere the universe is continuing to expand rapidly and tear itself apart. Another possible solution is that we find a way to leave our universe and go to one of the other theoretical bubble universes in the Multiverse. They could use negative energy to create a wormhole. The bubble universes are floating in a 10 dimensional arena—Read for the Astronomy prompt for the 2019 OWLs Readathon"

The second reason for listening twice is that it is chock full of info that is easy to miss in an audio format - so I also downloaded the Kindle version...I love Michio Kaku’s books. This one is about fun science of the future. Space travel - where are we, what do we still need to do, where would we go, how would we need to alter ourselves for outer space, what spacecrafts would we use, etc. Fun stuff, all told in an approachable, interesting story format. Kaku loves science fiction and peppers the narrative with movie and book references. Interestingly enough, he judges most of it more science and less fiction. Kaku is a physics professor, thus the physics are very solid; but I have my doubts on some of the biotechnology parts. Nevertheless, a thoroughly enjoyable book that I ended up listening to within about a day."
34,0241304849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8686546-feyzan---the-raven-boy,3,"3.5 starsthe journey of a thousand miles begins with the first stepI don't know what I was thinking when I picked this book up. I don't usually like to read books that are dense with physics and cosmology, but I admire michio kaku so i had to give this one a try. I am not surprised to feel disappointed, however. This book was pretty good on entertainment, and I understand why nerds would love it, but it did nothing for me, except maybe entertain a little. I couldn't take this book seriously as it was brimming with speculations about things that may or may not happen in next 5 billion years. I mean instead of worrying about what will happen in 5 billion years shouldn't we focus on saving our planet from all the man made chaos?I enjoyed the science fiction elements and reading about how tenaciously scientists are trying to make science fiction a new reality for humanity. It was all very interesting to read. The book covered many topics like terraforming, multi-verse, robotics, transhumanism. All these heavy and dense topic were easier to grasp and understand thanks to michio kaku's writing style and movie references. It feels like a new war is in order between the richest people of the world as they compete to colonize Mars and the universe itself. I think these rich people, Instead of spending billions of dollars on space exploration and planning to colonize other planets, should spend some of their foturne and influence to make this planet safe for everyone, Just saying. When I was a kid I used to dream about meeting aliens, going on a mission to space and whatnot. My imaginations used to very elaborated,  I used to imagine alines and robots in a very fanciful way. Robots used to have chips inside of them that could shut them off, if they tried to take over the world. Then I grew up. However, reading this book made me realize that some people are incapable of growing up.
 When self-aware robots do arrive, we must add a fail-safe chip that will shut them off if they have murderous thoughts.
I mean, first of all, no self aware robot is arriving anytime soon. Second of all, no self-aware robot will insert a chip inside of itself (I forgot to mention these robots are supposed to be self-replicating too.) Anyway, you get the idea this book is high on speculation and overflowing with head-scratching logic.
In 2017, a controversy arose between two billionaires, Mark Zuckerberg, founder of Facebook, and Elon Musk of SpaceX and Tesla. Zuckerberg maintained that artificial intelligence was a great generator of wealth and prosperity that will enrich all of society. Musk, however, took a much darker view and stated that AI actually posed an existential risk to all of humanity, that one day our creations may turn on us.
Wow, this exactly what we needed to be discussing right now. 🙄 Zuckerbergs' first concern should be to be make Facebook safe and secure again, not this. And then this book celebrate psychotic maniacs and call them heroes. 
 He confided to me that he takes several hundred pills a day, anticipating his own immortality
I guess, this book isn't meant to be taken seriously. It's just good to get inside the heads of scientists and learn how they operate and how they see the future. This book has imbued me with unnecessary knowledge that I don't know where and how to use. This knowledge is increasing my, already soaring, existential angst that wont rest until I use this knowledge somewhere. Anyway, this book isn't bad. It just wasn't for me. I am sure nerds and Sci-fi fans will love it."

Kaku addresses the possibilities of setting up permanent bases on the moon and terraforming Mars. At some point, humanity will need to move beyond the solar system to settle planets revolving around nearby stars. He also addresses genetic changes people may undergo, how humans will begin to merge with AI/machines, and ways immortality may become possible. It's fascinating stuff that should please both science and sci-fi fans."

It really normalizes the thoughts of leaving Earth and not only exploring beyond, but settling beyond. Even crazier notions of removing our minds from our bodies to travel via laser beams to the exterior of our galaxy into exoskeletons waiting for us is explored. And logically. I recommend this book just for the sake of expanding your thoughts on outer space and the future of where humankind may end up."

Off course It was a pleasant experience because it get me acquainted with a world which I was unfamiliar with. Reading "" The future of humanity"", I thought about many serious subjects and my mind was blowing up with interesting informations about almost everything. From space to physics theories, everything was explained in simple words and that was the beauty of this book. Reading this book gives you a clear insight about the future of us as humans and discusses several probable possibilities in the long life span of humankind during his/her adventure in the space. I recommend those who are new to this genre, to read this work as their first experience, and I promise that it will be their best first experience!📚😊"
39,0241304849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7258380-dan-graser,4,"In his latest work, physicist Michio Kaku has focused on the what the future life of humanity might be as pertains to several possible scenarios. Throughout the work he mostly does a decent job of suggesting how plausible these ideas are, or at the very least, the type of timeframe needed to develop the requisite technological capabilities to achieve them. Beginning with the colonization of Mars, Kaku does a fine job of explaining just how this very popular notion would have to work, the costs involved, where our current capabilities stand, and just who is at the forefront of this quest. As NASA continues to be underfunded, though they do have a Mars program in operation, private funding has taken over much of this territory and the competition created by these developments is changing just how (some, particularly wealthy) humans may leave this planet for good.Next Kaku takes up the idea of interstellar travel. This is one area where the type of technology required is hundreds of years away. This distances to other star systems is staggering, our technology still primitive, and the pace at which we could develop any sort of device traveling remotely close to the speed of light is very difficult to predict. Some hugely interesting ideas are posited but he is quick to note that many of these are at the moment very unrealistic.The intersection of AI and humanity is discussed but not in particularly great detail. I would recommend Max Tegmark on this subject as his picture is a bit more complete. Anyone who has read the literature on this likely already has a more thorough understanding than is presented in this section.Finally and perhaps most significantly, Kaku details what physics tells us about the end of space and time and the possibility to forestall these dire (though billions of years in the future) events with technology developed to harness the gravitational effect of dark matter and dark energy. As we still have no idea as to the workings of either of these this is of course purely speculative but this is the first I've heard of these compelling ideas. As with all of his books, Kaku is an engaging and accessible writer that only occasionally veers into oversimplification or inclusion of ideas purely for their mass appeal, not for their plausibility. This is an effective summary of where we are as pertains to the possible routes humanity might take to ensure, at the level of our entire species, our survival. Wonderful reading all around."

Unlike pessimists like Harari who fear human life becoming meaningless by advances in AI, he imagines using progresses in technology to settle and terraform Mars and elsewhere ! The first section which focuses on near future technologies and space travel was an absolute delight.Also, his vision is not limited to the next decade or 20 years, he also talks about possibilities in the next 100 and 1000 years and even later. Except for the last chapters on wormholes and time-travel which felt weird, enjoyed this joyride. A bit like a spiritual guru the author was expanding my mind’s horizons with his thought-experiments.Will be reading more by this author."

"
43,0241304849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2433243-ayami,4,"Michio Kaku talks about a lot of interesting concepts regarding technology, space exploration and science. It wasn’t a mind-blowing read, though, as the majority of what he talks about has been mentioned in plenty of other non-fiction books out there. However, I won’t penalize the book for introducing themes I happened to be already familiar with. Some physics stuff I found hard to follow but this could be due to the fact, I was listening to it as an audiobook. Some reviewers complained about the onslaught of the pop culture references but I enjoyed them and think they were pretty well incorporated into the text. This could be because I have seen the majority of the movies mentioned, though. "

Topics range from propulsion systems to AI and biological enhancements. While a number of the author's ideas are not particularly convincing, virtually all are interesting."
50,0241304849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6991670-bob,4,"Summary: An exploration of the possibility and necessity of humanity becoming a multi-planetary species, and the revolutions of technology necessary to realize that future.Michio Kaku is a theoretical theorist studying string theory at the City University of New York, and the author of a series of best-selling futurist works based on his knowledge of physics and other fields. He is also a riveting, passionate speaker who believes, along with others like Elon Musk, that we must envision becoming a multi-planetary species. This, the latest of his books, explores that idea, it's necessity, and the technological advances that could make this possible.Kaku argument for the necessity of becoming a multi-planetary species is rooted in the priority of the survival of the human species. He is convinced that, whether through physical causes ranging from cataclysmic volcanoes to asteroids or the final death throes of the sun, our planet will become unlivable for human beings--if we do not accomplish this first through human causation as in nuclear holocaust or global warming. Discussing other great challenges we've faced through history, he writes:But now we face perhaps the greatest challenge of all: to leave the confines of the Earth and soar into outer space. The laws of physics are clear; sooner or later we will face global crises that threaten our very existence. (p.6)In three parts he explores the technologies that can make this possible. The first part explores interplanetary settlement efforts within our solar system, using moon as a base, and Mars as our first settlement, and later possibly settling, or exploiting the resources of the large moons orbiting the gas giants of Jupiter and Saturn. He describes existing efforts by public and private enterprise to return to the moon and create settlements on Mars. This itself is formidable considering exposures to radioactivity and the inhospitable nature of the planet but he argues for the eventual possibility of terra-forming Mars, making it livable and life sustaining. What is fascinating is that much of this is possible by applying and extending our current technology, albeit at great cost.The second part of the book seemed like something out of Star Trek, exploring the technologies of interstellar travel. All of this is beyond our current technologies. As a physicist, he takes us on a tour of possible technologies from nanoships and laser and solar sail propelled vehicles, to ramjet fusion and antimatter engines, and proposes that the warp drive of The Enterprise is possible, and consists not in propelling one faster than light, but literally warping space so that a vessel is pulled through it at hyper light speeds. Nearly all of this requires inordinately great quantities of energy, and presupposes a level of civilization at which we harness, first the energies of the sun, and than galactic levels of energy. This will allow us to explore at least the nearby stars or further into a galaxy of stars where it is increasingly evident that there are many possible habitable planets.The third part explores the reality that the great distances to be traveled, even should we exceed the speed of light, either require multi-generational crews, or advances toward immortality. He explores research on curing aging, on trans-humanism in which humans and machines become increasingly integrated. He discusses the Human Connectome Project, in which human neural networks are mapped, digitized, and potentially could be reproduced light years away, transmitted via laser networks. He also speculates on the existence of other more advanced civilizations. He mentions observations of recurring drops in energy output of star KIC 8462852 by as much as 30 percent positing an object 22 times as large as Jupiter, speculating that one possibility would be a megastructure like a Dyson sphere constructed by an alien civilization.This part also gets into Kaku's area of theoretical physics, string theory, as he explores the possibility of travel through wormholes and stargates and perhaps even escaping the present universe into one of many multiverses, particularly useful when this one burns out.Whew! Kaku's tour of the technologies necessary for interstellar travel is both breathtaking, and staggering. On one hand, much of the technology we use today, even that I am using as I write, was science fiction in my childhood. It is always dangerous to scoff at what seems impossible. The cell phone at my side represents applications of theoretical physics unknown 150 years ago in terms of the miniaturized circuitry and memory, cellular and wi-fi capabilities, GPS tracking, and touch screens. What would have been an object of wonder 150 years ago is now a commonplace of many of our lives. Yet what Kaku describes in this book, particularly in parts two and three, strings together ventures of immense cost, requiring unimaginable amounts of power, huge quantities of rare (and dangerous) resources like anti-matter, as well as scenarios, the survivability of which are in question, all of which to preserve the human species on a multi-planetary scale. Of course Kaku allows millenia for reaching such capabilities.The most credible part of the book for me was the near-term ideas of travel to Mars, perhaps even establishing some form of outpost there. If something of a cataclysmic nature were to occur on Earth in the next couple centuries, such an outpost might preserve civilization, and even re-settle earth. Even this is tremendously costly as well as risky. We must expect lives to be lost, even as they were among other explorers and settlers throughout our history. But it also raised questions of several sorts.Some were questions of priority. Should we think of terra-forming Mars when our own planet's earth, water and air need so much attention? Should we pour huge funds and inordinate amounts of energy into space travel when transport on earth is still carbon-based and polluting? When we are not yet addressing preventable diseases of childhood, and providing quality and affordable health care on a global basis, is it right to pour huge amounts into life-extending technologies that may benefit a select few? Or even as we think about planetary defense, might we focus on technologies for detection and destruction of planet-threatening objects from outer space? All this falls under the question of caring for the planet and people that we have before we think about settling other worlds.Some are more fundamental questions having to do with whether we ought to do these things. I think of this particularly around the discussion of immortality. Kaku fails to deal with the issue of whether it is a good thing for humans with our flawed as well as noble nature to live for ever. Have you ever noticed how, as people age, they become who they always were, to an even greater degree? We may grow both more loving and more neurotic. We may grow more knowledgeable and more petty. The closest he gets to this is when he quotes the late Stephen Hawking who said, ""We only have to look at ourselves to see how intelligent life might develop into something we wouldn't want to meet."" In my own faith tradition, we believe that it is a severe mercy of God that flawed and fallen people don't live endlessly in our bodies and that hope is found not in endless mortal life, but life everlasting beyond bodily death.Finally, I am troubled with the hubristic strains that carry as much attraction for many contemporary hearers as they did for the first couple in the garden, and the tower builders of Babel. Kaku writes:...our destiny is to become the gods we once feared and worshipped. Science will give us the means by which we can shape the universe in our image. The question is whether we will have the wisdom of Solomon to accompany this vast celestial power. (p. 14)""You shall be as gods"" has been a temptation from the very beginning, and is one this book proffers to its readers. Along with that temptation comes tower-building (or space elevator) projects that reflect our pitiful efforts to offset our creaturely vulnerabilities. Will we exchange dependence on the sustenance of the Creator and responsible care for the world we've been given for anxious and costly efforts to preserve ourselves in other worlds, and perhaps neglect the most vulnerable on our own planet? I find the reference to Solomon fascinating, because the record tells us that, while wise, he abandoned the fear of God which is the beginning of wisdom, giving himself to building projects that taxed and enslaved, and that he multiplied wives and experiences. If Ecclesiastes gives us the final verdict on this project, it is all summed up as ""meaningless,"" ""a chasing after the wind,"" and that ""with much wisdom comes much sorrow."" It seems that this is what always comes of trying to make ourselves gods, and trying to stave off death when a universe of wonder and a world of beauty to be cared for beckons us to trust its Maker."

Not to mention some truly stupid claims in here, such as his belief that only human beings (as opposed to other animals) possess an awareness of time. That's incorrect by inspection.And worse - it's boring. It feels less like ""The Future of Humanity"" and more like ""Cliffnotes of the Future of Humanity."" You would be vastly better served reading a science fiction book that explores these ideas of interstellar travel, generation arks, AI, etc. The Martian; The Expanse; etc, etc.BUT one major positive is just how much research this book inspired me into.

So some of the facts contained goes up to things happening in 2017, which is nice.The latter part of the book touching on quantum and string theory, starts going over one's head a bit. Although explained as simple as possible, it does become a bit difficult to follow in audio format. You also need to be really open minded to get your head around some of the concepts / possibilities presented for the future.

This is my first from author Michio Kaku, but won't be my last.Kaku writes with a very engaging style, that holds the reader's attention effortlessly. This is a welcome change to many, many other science books I have read that are plagued by long-winded, esoteric and dry writing.The book is written in an easy-to-follow manner that would be suitable for the layperson who may be not too familiar with science. Kaku is an extremely effective science communicator; he takes complicated ideas, and conveys them in a simple and easy to understand manner. We need many more like him, IMHO.As mentioned, the book's formatting is excellent, as well. It is broken down into 3 main parts:
1) LEAVING THE EARTH2) VOYAGE TO THE STARS3) LIFE IN THE UNIVERSE
Which then break further down into different chapters. Kaku ends most chapters with a really natural segway to the upcoming one. The book has an excellent flow to it.If you were a fan of sci-fi as a kid, or are curious about what the future has in store for the human race, then this book is for you. The Future of Humanity covers (among many others): *The history of rockets; pioneers Goddard and von Braun.*Missions to the moon and Mars; the possibilities of living on either.*The asteroid belt, and possibilities of mining them.*The gas giants, Venus, Titan, and other moons.*Robotics, AI, and self-replicating robots.*Transhumanism*Spaceships; different theoretical technologies, and rocket types.*Black holes, wormholes, and spacetime.*The possibility of life on other worlds.*String theory and multiverses.I thoroughly enjoyed this book, and would most definitely recommend it to anyone interested in astronomy, physics, and the future of humanity in general. It is a big-picture book, with many incredible ideas that are sure to capture your imagination.5 stars, and a spot on my ""Favorites"" shelf."
58,0241304849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25338445-angie-reisetter,3,"Kaku is a great tour guide to the possibilities of the distant future. He imagines what may be possible, or at least what is not ruled out by the laws of physics as we know them. He has the tendency in this book, as he does in his others, to introduce topics with words like ""perhaps"" and ""might"", and then to drop them altogether, so that it sounds like he is telling us what will happen, casting aside minor difficulties like cost and human will. He threads science fiction references throughout his narrative, almost organizing his argument by what he's seen/read in science fiction. That's not a terrible way to go, but he also blurs the line of reality there, asking himself how we reconcile two different views of the future, as if they are not fictional and must be reconciled. The whole thing is very entertaining. But he has a theorist's tendency to discount reality, which is always my criticism of his work. But I did come back for more, and his work is always worth reading. A little inspiration is called for right about now.There seem to be a number of science futures becoming available in the near future, and I've recently read Soonish: Ten Emerging Technologies That'll Improve and/or Ruin Everything, which is very different from this one. I recommend them both as a study in contrasts: Kaku's extends to the limits of what might be possible one day maybe, and Soonish tries to keep it, well, soonish, in the realm of the reasonably possible. They have some topics in common, but they diverge rather dramatically.I got a copy to review from Net Galley."

(ok, a little wordy. What he's saying is it's hard to increasingly acceleration (that's what change in velocity is). You're going to need to accellorate for a while and at a crazy high speed if you want to leave earth for another planet. They are pretty far away.p. 32 - He deals with some of the politics and economics. He talks about it being easier to fund a person going into space vs program itself. As a result, many compromises (as that's more expensive to support life vs. just do unmanned missions).p. 33 - ""It takes $10k to put a pound of anything up in space.""p. 34 - The story of the great imperial fleet of Admiral Zheng 1405 - 1433. I really want to look thi up, b/c this was a big deal as relates to why there are Chinese people in specific places on the earth like Madagascar. Glad to finally get a citation. p. 40 Jules Verne's method of shooting someone to the moon predates rocket fuel. That's a major innovation. Blue Origin - company by Bezo's rocket system is called New ShepardElon Musk's Space X is called Falcon Rocket.p. 41Blue origin is billing it as a tourism voyage with an orientation.p. 43 Beso's vision: ""The whole idea is to perserve the Earth... The goal [is] to be able to evacuate humans. The planet would become a park."" All the waste would be ejected into space. In 2017 he announced his plans: ""Once considered a lonely outpost in space, the moon would become a bustling industrial and commercial hub with permanent manned bases and manufacturing."" p. 44 Moon Express plans on mining the moon.p. 45 The outer space treaty does not contain any language related to real estate ownership of the moon and it's annoying to many people to think of it.p. 47 - The book moves into the other tech that has to exist if you're legit going to go the moon. The first has to do with medical care. Robots need to get better for things like remote-controlled surgery. Similarly a lot more work has to go in withstanding radiation.p. 50 Talks about how the moon was formed through a huge impact billions of years ago. The Earth looked like packman and the Moon a slice. All that changed through gravity.p. 62 - Musk's company's vision to Mars...he's on track to try to send a manned mission to mars by 2024. Typically estimates have said it would cost betwen $400-500b. He's trying to do it for $10bln. He's trying to get the price down per ride to $200k so that it competes with Virgin's galactic SpaceShipTwo. There's also pricing for the Russian rocket International Space Station which is $20-40m. I never knew the price of this stuff. Nice.p. 67 The total failure (which is always fatal) of going into space is about 1.5% (3 failures out of 135) with the fatality count being about 3.3%. With mars, most satellites do not make it there (3/4ths do not).p. 85 - MDRS Mars Desert Research station attempts to make realistic situations to determine the psychological effects of being on MARS.p. 87 - Terraforming in terms of DNA. There is an idea that DNA came from Mars and transformed the earth. p. 93 - They believe that MARS lost its magnetic field (necessary to protect the planet) from heavy bombardment. It's why the core is solid vs. lava like ours.p. 94 - ""The Earth is larger than Mars, so it did not coll down as quickly. The Earth also did not suffer a collapse of its magnetic field caused by giant meteor impacts."" p. 99 - Some people want to break off a piece of Europa and bring it to mars to repopulate the planet with water.p. 103 - Titan has atmosphere and would actually support life, though we'd stll need a few other things. p. 116 - The use of AI to help explore the planets in preparation for human entrance. Or alternatively,we just move our organic body into a computer one so we can enjoy space travel.p. 118 - He introduces Neural Networks p. 121 - Self-replicating robots are necessary in space. this describes what they have to be like.p. 129 He has a theory that humans differ from animals b/c we notice time. I'm not 100% sure I agree. but ok.p. 156 HE talks about the challenge of stopping a rocket ship.p. 158 The space elevator is another option often tossed around.p. 169 Parallax. didn't know that word.p. 170 - Talks about how we find planets with minor dimming of light.p. 178 talks about rogue planets.p. 190 sets up for the idea that medical drives the ability of humans to expand into new territories.Solving aging (telemeers) is about allowing us to go to space.p. 204 Again putting you in a robot might work.p. 206 - They talk about the exoskeleton and where that's at.p. 211 - The chip in glasses to type out a sentence is early stage communication via just neural activity.p. 226- What if alliens are WAY ahead of us? p. 233 - It almost goes backward in talking about what makes Humans the best on earth. It's not b/c we are strong We are actually worthless in strengh and other characteristics.p. 248 A dyson sphere is created around a star to harness the energy that comes off of it.p. 258 They are looking for someone that has done this in the galaxy to see if some other species has left a big footprint like we have on earth. So far, no luck.p. 261 Talks about how DNA can demonstrate the rate of divergence/mutation. It's really slow. Weird would have thought it would be driven by the amount/speed of procreation. p. 323 A great reading list. I'd like to one day take a look at all of these books."
60,0241304849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/912138-alex-givant,5,Excellent book about what we need to do to leave Earth and spread between stars.
61,0241304849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/897-abe,4,"I enjoyed reading that book. While I don't agree with some of the author's views on the future of humanity, the book is very well written in an engaging style. I am now excited to dig more into string theory and super symmetry. "
62,0241304849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22443749-debbie,4,"4.5 starsThe Future of Humanity is a fascinating piece of speculative astrophysics and science which seeks to explore the various ways humanity may expand our civilization across the universe. I thoroughly enjoyed how in depth Kaku got, not just laying out the potential opportunities but also fully explaining the science behind the theories. Despite this heavily scientific approach, this book never felt boring or overwhelming. Even if some of the topics were a little far-fetched, it was nevertheless an intriguing and engaging read.—75,000 years ago there was a major volcanic eruption (Topa); considered the biggest eruption in the past 25 million years. Some scientists speculate only 2,000 humans remained and had to repopulate, which is why DNA between people even if they’re not related is surprisingly similarWhen you consider every single creature that has ever lived on the earth such as amoebas, plants, dinosaurs etc., you find that 99.9% have gone extinct, meaning the creatures and living things that are alive today are an extremely small sliver of all the living things that have ever lived on the planetOur earth has gone through 5 major extinction cycles in our history, in which up to 90% of the living species went extinct at a timeBecause our galaxy has 100 billion stars there may be as many as 20 billion Earth sized planets in the Milky Way galaxy. it’s estimated there is 2 billion trillion earth sized planets in the visible universe including galaxies outside our ownThere is actually gravity in space and the feeling/illusion of weightlessness is because everything falls at the same rate so astronauts are falling at the same rate as the spaceshipIn the future, we may use the moon as a gas station, because ice at the South Pole can be used to farm oxygen and hydrogen which are primary components of rocket fuel, and also rare earth metals found there as well which are also able to be made into fuel. Helium 3 is also expected to be on the moon, which can be used for Fusion reactors. There is also talk of finding platinum. All this raises the question of whether it’s legal to mine on the moon and if so who can stake a claim on itIf we built a living space on the moon, at first it would need to be sent supplies from Earth every few weeks. The astronauts could use Internet, cell phones etc. as normal once they set up the proper technology because the delay between earth and the moon is only one second. They could potentially farm oxygen from the soil and water from the ice caps. The bases may be built underground to protect from solar radiation. There will need to be large amounts of solar panels because a moon day lasts an Earth month, so there are 2 weeks of day followed by 2 weeks of nightYour blood boils in the vacuum of space because as pressure drops the boiling point of water also dropsAstroids contain iron, nickel, carbon & cobalt, as well as significant quantities of rare earth metals and valuable metals including irradium, platinum, and rodium. It is believed that we will eventually mine the astroid belt, and many entrepreneurs have already expressed interest in finding ways to do so. 12 astroids have already been identified as key targets for mining, because only a slight nudge to their orbit would bring them closer towards earth and the moon and able to enter into orbit, making mining them much more efficientElon musk‘s goal with space X is to reduce the cost of commercial space travel by 10x. He was the 1st to invent a reusable booster capsule module rather than discarding it after use. His ultimate goal is to make it to Mars. His goal is to send a manned mission to Mars by 2024. He envisions eventually the cost of sending someone to Mars will be $200,000/person round-tripIt only takes 3?days to get to the moon but 9 months to get to Mars. A round trip to Mars would take 2 years. Potential dangers during this deep space trip include excessive exposure to radiation, damage to the ship from solar flares or micro astroids, muscular atrophy from being in reduced gravity so long, and psychological side effectsNASA plans on having a manned mission arrive at Mars by 2033; this plan involves creating a lunar space station from which ships could go to Mars, rather than going directly to Mars like space XLike the moon, explorers on Mars would be able to harvest water, oxygen, and hydrogen from the permafrost and ice to serve as sources for water, oxygen, and fuel. The days on Mars are similar in length to days on earth, but the temperature is extremely cold, barely above the freezing point of water during the day and dropping drastically at night. Like the moon, the gravity is less so explorers would have to exercise daily to avoid muscular atrophy and loss of bone density. Mars has both water ice caps and dry ice/CO2 ice caps. The water ice caps stay consistent year round, but the dry ice caps fluctuate with the seasons and mostly evaporate in the summerFor Mars to become truly habitable, we would need to find a way to slowly heat the atmosphere so liquid water could flow on the surface, allowing for plants to grow outside of contained greenhouses. Terraforming mars is probably centuries away, and may be prohibitively costly. To artificially raise the temperature of the planet, we may inject water vapor and methane into the atmosphere to create a greenhouse effect, or send satellites into orbit over the ice caps to direct concentrated sunlight towards the caps to cause them to melt and release water vapor. Eventually, this warming process would become self-sustaining as well as increase the atmospheric pressure of mars. As plants grow and proliferate, dying plants will enrich the soil, and growing plants will add oxygen to the atmosphereMars cooled down slower than Earth did. Mars no longer has a molten core but rather a solid rock core, so it doesn’t have a magnetic field. This is one of the factors that accelerated Mars’s atmosphere loss. Also, the carbon dioxide is mostly trapped in the ground instead of proliferating in the atmosphere, causing a reverse greenhouse effectSome of the moons of the gas giants are also viewed as potential candidates for human coloniesThe gas giants are theorized to have a thick gaseous atmosphere, a cold liquid hydrogen ocean around the entire planet, and a small, solid hydrogen core because of the extreme pressures. Jupiter is surrounded by radiation, which causes Radio interference. The gravity of Jupiter actually helps protect the earth from being bombarded by astroids because it essentially serves as a vacuum cleanerTitan (a moon of Saturn) is a potential candidate for human colonization, but because it’s so far away it can’t have self-sustaining greenhouse effect, and the lakes of ethane Could combust if it got too hot. But it could be a source of fuel. And it’s one of the few places in our solar system where we would be able to go outside without a spacesuit because it has enough of an atmosphere that our blood wouldn’t boil/we wouldn’t be crushed (we’d still need an oxygen mask). Europa (a moon of Jupiter) has potential for microbial life in its ocean (which sits under the layer of ice that encircles the moon, and was made possible because of friction caused from the extreme tidal forces caused by Jupiter’s gravity)All the gas giants have rings, which are likely caused by moons that got too close to the planet being torn apart by the planet’s gravityTitan and the Kuiper belt would most likely serve as refueling stations or points from which to jump to the next star or planetGraphene/carbon nanotubes will likely be the material used to make infrastructure on other planets, because it’s immensely strong yet incredibly light. We’re not at a point yet where we can mass produce it, because even a small impurity can ruin it, but once we have the technology to do so, it’ll be the best material to use. It could even be used to create skin-tight, lightweight spacesuitsFor Interstellar and planetary colonization to be realistic, we would need automatons—robots with more intelligence than our current ones who can perform a wide variety of tasks such as building cities on planets and moons, which would be easier for a robot (doesn’t need a spacesuit, doesn’t get affected by radiation, isn’t limited by oxygen supply, etc)Getting robots to understand common sense has been extremely difficult and currently prevents them from fully perceiving and navigating the world. Currently robots need human intervention to do most tasks. Modern robots will likely be a combination of top down and bottom up learning; they will have some information already integrated into their systems but they will also have neural networks that will allow them to learn from repetition and gain common sense. Robots would also need to be self replicatingIon engines may make it possible for the trip to Mars to take 40 days rather than 9 monthsPotential energy sources for traveling at the speed of light include light sailing (propelling with lasers), nuclear energy (propelling with nuclear explosions), and antimatter energy. an antimatter rocket would have 100% energy efficiency, whereas nuclear explosion only has 1% because most of the Energy is wasted. However only a very small amount of anti-matter exists naturally, so we would have to manufacture it (currently extremely expensive). Storing the antimatter would be difficult because it would have to be stored in a trap that suspends it in a magnetic field so it’s not able to touch the edges of the container; if it touch the edges it would destroy the containerSomething that would help make getting materials into space much easier and more economical is creating a space elevator that stretches from the surface of the earth out above our atmosphere. Scientists predict that it is theoretically possible to do so, possibly even by 2035, but we would need to find a way to make enough strong enough Materials for this to be feasible. Ideally pure carbon nanotubes would be used, but right now it would be difficult to make as much as would be neededTo travel faster than light at warp speed, we need to find a way to make vast quantities of negative matter or negative energy. We’ve been able to make small amounts of negative energy, but we are nowhere close to producing the amount needed to even consider developing warp drivesSuspended animation/cryogenic freezing to allow longer voyages without needing generations of people to live on a spaceship is currently not possible. While other animals are able to survive in suspended animation because of the levels of glucose in their blood which prevents their blood from freezing, the amount of sugar needed is too high for humansTelomeres are part of our chromosomes that get shorter with aging; when they get too short the cells can no longer divide. If we can prevent that shortening from happening, it would increase our life span because our cells would be able to divide and replicate themselves longer. However, cancer operates in the same way and is essentially immortal, so that would be a riskIf we were able to identify exactly what parts of our genetic make up contribute to aging, we could alter our genes to expand our life expectancyAging is thought to be the accumulation of errors in our genetic make up over time, so if we can prevent those errors from happening because of deteriorating cell replication then we can slow down the aging processIf we were able to somehow make ourselves inmortal, or drastically increase our life expectancy, then we would likely have to deal with extreme overpopulation eventually. Before the Industrial Revolution, the human population of the earth was 300 million or less. It has now grown to 7.5 billion and is anticipated to increase by 1 billion every 12 years. It is estimated that there will be 11.2 billion people on the earth by 2100. However, others argued that our increase in population is slowly going down and will stabilize before we reach a level of overpopulationA primate has never been cloned. If we come to the point where human cloning is possible, it is likely that only a small percentage of the population would do so. It is also speculated that eventually we will find ways to modify our genes or enhance our bodies through cybernetics, but we will likely not take it so far that we drastically modify our appearance. Modifications would likely be improvements to existing issues (ex: eyesight) or ways to improve our social standing, rather than becoming creatures with giant heads and huge eyes and skinny bodies. Our use of cybernetics would prevent us from evolving that drastically. If we were to disperse in colonies across the galaxy, our genetic makeup would remain within 0.1% difference between colonies (same as between humans currently)We may in the next century or so develop ways to laser port our consciousness across the galaxy so our physical bodies could remain in place while our consciousness is able to move at the speed of light to visit other places by being ported it into an avatarEarth like planets need to be accompanied by large gaseous Jupiter like planets to clear out incoming astroids. They also need to be accompanied by a larger moon to stabilize their spin and trajectoryThe drake equation attempts to estimate the probability that we will make contact with intelligent life forms; however there is still a lot of unknowns that prevent us from having an accurate assessment from this equationIf there are intelligent beings on other planets, we can’t assume that they communicate vocally the same way we do. They might communicate through pheromones like bugs, or sonar like batsIntelligent life will likely follow the laws of evolution. An intelligent species will likely be descended from predators, so it will have forward facing eyes. They will also likely have opposable thumbs or some type of grasping appendage. They will also have some form of languageKardishev scale of civilizations: A type 1 civilization (planetary) uses all the energy of the sunlight that falls on the planet. Type 2 civilization (stellar) uses all the energy it’s sun produces. A type 3 civilization (galactic) uses the energy of an entire galaxy. We are currently a type 0.7 civilization because we’re not using the full energy of all the sunlight shining on our planet. We are about a century or two away from becoming a full type 1, and possibly A few thousand years from becoming a type 2. We might not become type 3 for 100,000 years or even up to 1 million because it requires a level of interstellar travel that we’re nowhere close to having. The energy measurements for each type just means and equivalent amount of energy, it doesn’t mean you have to be getting all your energy from the sun. Each next level of civilization is between 10 to 100 billion times more powerful than the previous typeA civilization that has reached type 2 is likely nearly immortal, and most of its energy generating machinery will likely be placed off planet because there will be so much energy being produced that it creates too much heat for the planet to be habitable. They will likely also harvest energy from their sun through a Dyson sphere and because of the vast quantities they are harvesting Will emit infrared radiationThere is another scale of civilization that is calculated based on the amount of information it consumes as proposed by Carl Sagan. Type A civilization consumes 1,000,000 bits of information. Type Z civilization consumes a 10^31 bits of information. We are a type H civilization. By this scale a type two civilization would be able to consume energy through widely distributed Dyson sphere, harvesting from astroids, developing super efficient nano technology, etc. and avoid giving up the levels of infrared radiation that would make it detectable to usOur first encounter with alien civilization will likely be a robotic self replicating probeString theory exists in 10 dimensions. It cancels out quantum corrections, basically meaning it cancels out the fact that quantum things like electrons and protons are able to be in multiple places at once. This quantum cancellation can only happen in 10 dimensions. The pairing for particles in string theory is sparticles, quarks are squarks, etc. String theory assumes an infinite number of universes (Multiverse). String theory says the universe was originally 10 dimensions, then for some reason the other 6 dimensions “curled up” leaving us with only 4 perceivable dimensionsDark matter was discovered because astrophysicist realized that the Milky Way was spinning 10 times faster than Newtonian physics would allow without flying apart, so they realize there must be some invisible thing adding all that extra mass to the galaxy. Dark matter is invisible, but it bends starlight so we’re able to detect it that way. Dark matter has gravity, but can’t be held/interact with matter in any way. It’s electrically neutral and only interacts with gravity. However we’ve never been able to officially prove that dark matter exist yet or create it ourselves in any way. Once we do, it will prove string theoryString theory is the only way would be able to do calculations about the quantum corrections needed for time travel, going through a wormhole, faster than light travel, etcThe universe is expected to eventually end in 1 of 3 ways: the big crunch, the big freeze, or the big rip. The big crunch is when the expansion of the universe slow down, stops, and reverses itself, eventually coalescing in a giant wad of superheated matter and possibly eventually turning into another big bang. For the big freeze, by the laws of entropy eventually the stars will stop shining, the sky will go black and temperature will reach absolute zero wherein matter nearly ceases to move. The big rip refers to the fact that the universe is exponentially expanding far faster than anticipated, and that distant galaxies will eventually speed away from us faster than the speed of light and disappear. Eventually our galaxy and solar system would be torn apart from this rapid expansion. The universe would end in an explosion, a singularity of infinite energyOur sun will exhaust its energy in about 5 billion years; it will expand into a red giant star which will essentially set the earth on fire, mountains will melt, oceans will boil, and the earth will be engulfed. After this, the sun will exhaust all its nuclear fuel and shrink and go cold as a white dwarf and then die as a dark dwarf star. In 4.8 billion years, the Milky Way and Andromeda galaxy’s will collide. There are two black holes will collide and merge and a new galaxy will eventually be formedDark energy is the energy of a vacuum. It acts like antigravity, and it pushes the universe apart. It is different than dark matter. The more the universe expands, the more dark energy there is, which makes the universe expand faster. About 69% of the matter/energy in the universe is contained in dark energy. Dark matter makes up 26%. Atoms of hydrogen and helium make up about 5%. And other higher elements that make up the earth, our bodies, etc. only make up 0.5%A possible way to overcome the eventual death of our universe is by becoming a type 4 civilization that harnesses extragalactic energy like dark energy and is able to reverse the big rip by creating a sphere in which dark energy reverses polarity so that inside the sphere The galaxies continue to survive normally while outside the sphere the universe is continuing to expand rapidly and tear itself apart. Another possible solution is that we find a way to leave our universe and go to one of the other theoretical bubble universes in the Multiverse. They could use negative energy to create a wormhole. The bubble universes are floating in a 10 dimensional arena—Read for the Astronomy prompt for the 2019 OWLs Readathon"
63,0241304849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2168708-marta,5,"I loved this so much that I listened to it twice. The second reason for listening twice is that it is chock full of info that is easy to miss in an audio format - so I also downloaded the Kindle version...I love Michio Kaku’s books. This one is about fun science of the future. Space travel - where are we, what do we still need to do, where would we go, how would we need to alter ourselves for outer space, what spacecrafts would we use, etc. Fun stuff, all told in an approachable, interesting story format. Kaku loves science fiction and peppers the narrative with movie and book references. Interestingly enough, he judges most of it more science and less fiction. Kaku is a physics professor, thus the physics are very solid; but I have my doubts on some of the biotechnology parts. Nevertheless, a thoroughly enjoyable book that I ended up listening to within about a day."
64,0241304849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8686546-feyzan---the-raven-boy,3,"3.5 starsthe journey of a thousand miles begins with the first stepI don't know what I was thinking when I picked this book up. I don't usually like to read books that are dense with physics and cosmology, but I admire michio kaku so i had to give this one a try. I am not surprised to feel disappointed, however. This book was pretty good on entertainment, and I understand why nerds would love it, but it did nothing for me, except maybe entertain a little. I couldn't take this book seriously as it was brimming with speculations about things that may or may not happen in next 5 billion years. I mean instead of worrying about what will happen in 5 billion years shouldn't we focus on saving our planet from all the man made chaos?I enjoyed the science fiction elements and reading about how tenaciously scientists are trying to make science fiction a new reality for humanity. It was all very interesting to read. The book covered many topics like terraforming, multi-verse, robotics, transhumanism. All these heavy and dense topic were easier to grasp and understand thanks to michio kaku's writing style and movie references. It feels like a new war is in order between the richest people of the world as they compete to colonize Mars and the universe itself. I think these rich people, Instead of spending billions of dollars on space exploration and planning to colonize other planets, should spend some of their foturne and influence to make this planet safe for everyone, Just saying. When I was a kid I used to dream about meeting aliens, going on a mission to space and whatnot. My imaginations used to very elaborated,  I used to imagine alines and robots in a very fanciful way. Robots used to have chips inside of them that could shut them off, if they tried to take over the world. Then I grew up. However, reading this book made me realize that some people are incapable of growing up.
 When self-aware robots do arrive, we must add a fail-safe chip that will shut them off if they have murderous thoughts.
I mean, first of all, no self aware robot is arriving anytime soon. Second of all, no self-aware robot will insert a chip inside of itself (I forgot to mention these robots are supposed to be self-replicating too.) Anyway, you get the idea this book is high on speculation and overflowing with head-scratching logic.
In 2017, a controversy arose between two billionaires, Mark Zuckerberg, founder of Facebook, and Elon Musk of SpaceX and Tesla. Zuckerberg maintained that artificial intelligence was a great generator of wealth and prosperity that will enrich all of society. Musk, however, took a much darker view and stated that AI actually posed an existential risk to all of humanity, that one day our creations may turn on us.
Wow, this exactly what we needed to be discussing right now. 🙄 Zuckerbergs' first concern should be to be make Facebook safe and secure again, not this. And then this book celebrate psychotic maniacs and call them heroes. 
 He confided to me that he takes several hundred pills a day, anticipating his own immortality
I guess, this book isn't meant to be taken seriously. It's just good to get inside the heads of scientists and learn how they operate and how they see the future. This book has imbued me with unnecessary knowledge that I don't know where and how to use. This knowledge is increasing my, already soaring, existential angst that wont rest until I use this knowledge somewhere. Anyway, this book isn't bad. It just wasn't for me. I am sure nerds and Sci-fi fans will love it."
65,0241304849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/77527711-j-c-ahmed,5,"The Future of Humanity, as the title suggests, makes predictions about humanity's future. Kaku addresses the possibilities of setting up permanent bases on the moon and terraforming Mars. At some point, humanity will need to move beyond the solar system to settle planets revolving around nearby stars. He also addresses genetic changes people may undergo, how humans will begin to merge with AI/machines, and ways immortality may become possible. It's fascinating stuff that should please both science and sci-fi fans."
66,0241304849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48491730-diego,5,"This was such an interesting book. It really normalizes the thoughts of leaving Earth and not only exploring beyond, but settling beyond. Even crazier notions of removing our minds from our bodies to travel via laser beams to the exterior of our galaxy into exoskeletons waiting for us is explored. And logically. I recommend this book just for the sake of expanding your thoughts on outer space and the future of where humankind may end up."

68,0241304849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61646219-roya,5,"It was my first experience in reading science books like this one. Off course It was a pleasant experience because it get me acquainted with a world which I was unfamiliar with. Reading "" The future of humanity"", I thought about many serious subjects and my mind was blowing up with interesting informations about almost everything. From space to physics theories, everything was explained in simple words and that was the beauty of this book. Reading this book gives you a clear insight about the future of us as humans and discusses several probable possibilities in the long life span of humankind during his/her adventure in the space. I recommend those who are new to this genre, to read this work as their first experience, and I promise that it will be their best first experience!📚😊"
69,0241304849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7258380-dan-graser,4,"In his latest work, physicist Michio Kaku has focused on the what the future life of humanity might be as pertains to several possible scenarios. Throughout the work he mostly does a decent job of suggesting how plausible these ideas are, or at the very least, the type of timeframe needed to develop the requisite technological capabilities to achieve them. Beginning with the colonization of Mars, Kaku does a fine job of explaining just how this very popular notion would have to work, the costs involved, where our current capabilities stand, and just who is at the forefront of this quest. As NASA continues to be underfunded, though they do have a Mars program in operation, private funding has taken over much of this territory and the competition created by these developments is changing just how (some, particularly wealthy) humans may leave this planet for good.Next Kaku takes up the idea of interstellar travel. This is one area where the type of technology required is hundreds of years away. This distances to other star systems is staggering, our technology still primitive, and the pace at which we could develop any sort of device traveling remotely close to the speed of light is very difficult to predict. Some hugely interesting ideas are posited but he is quick to note that many of these are at the moment very unrealistic.The intersection of AI and humanity is discussed but not in particularly great detail. I would recommend Max Tegmark on this subject as his picture is a bit more complete. Anyone who has read the literature on this likely already has a more thorough understanding than is presented in this section.Finally and perhaps most significantly, Kaku details what physics tells us about the end of space and time and the possibility to forestall these dire (though billions of years in the future) events with technology developed to harness the gravitational effect of dark matter and dark energy. As we still have no idea as to the workings of either of these this is of course purely speculative but this is the first I've heard of these compelling ideas. As with all of his books, Kaku is an engaging and accessible writer that only occasionally veers into oversimplification or inclusion of ideas purely for their mass appeal, not for their plausibility. This is an effective summary of where we are as pertains to the possible routes humanity might take to ensure, at the level of our entire species, our survival. Wonderful reading all around."
70,0241304849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8676317-a-man-called-ove,4,"अनंत से भी आगे !4.5/5 Michio Kaku reminds me of APJ Abdul Kalam in his optimism and enthusiasm about the future. Unlike pessimists like Harari who fear human life becoming meaningless by advances in AI, he imagines using progresses in technology to settle and terraform Mars and elsewhere ! The first section which focuses on near future technologies and space travel was an absolute delight.Also, his vision is not limited to the next decade or 20 years, he also talks about possibilities in the next 100 and 1000 years and even later. Except for the last chapters on wormholes and time-travel which felt weird, enjoyed this joyride. A bit like a spiritual guru the author was expanding my mind’s horizons with his thought-experiments.Will be reading more by this author."
71,0241304849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35088694-carly-friedman,4,"3.5 stars rounded up. I loved the first 2/3 of the book! The last few chapters started to drag, though. The last section on string theory and quantum physics was too advanced for me, unfortunately. Overall, I learned some fascination information about our galaxy, technological innovations, space travel, and threats to our planet. I do recommend it!"
72,0241304849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67214408-sathya,3,"If not for the end chapters where there is just too much discussion on theoretical physics, which does not seem entirely related to the subject matter of the book, or the seemingly very broad thought leaps on how we will become a multi-galactic species in the far future, this is a fascinating read on the near-future impact of space travel and the potential move to Mars. "
73,0241304849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2433243-ayami,4,"Michio Kaku talks about a lot of interesting concepts regarding technology, space exploration and science. It wasn’t a mind-blowing read, though, as the majority of what he talks about has been mentioned in plenty of other non-fiction books out there. However, I won’t penalize the book for introducing themes I happened to be already familiar with. Some physics stuff I found hard to follow but this could be due to the fact, I was listening to it as an audiobook. Some reviewers complained about the onslaught of the pop culture references but I enjoyed them and think they were pretty well incorporated into the text. This could be because I have seen the majority of the movies mentioned, though. "
74,0241304849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31705923-zahan,3,"Interesting content, but I'm not a huge fan of the writing. It’s really surface-level, leaping across one discipline to another. As someone well-familiar with the scientific principles, I almost rather he focus on fewer topics, but cover them more in-depth.Also, he’s often describing implementation for problems so far out that really all we should be talking about is principles and concepts.Good food for thought, but unfortunately not as satisfying as I’d hoped!"
75,0241304849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/106503484-connor-steckly,4,"This book is not too long but seemingly has no scope. The wide range of topics it covers acts as a good introduction to the leading edge (and beyond) technologies that will enable humanity to live on multiple planets and moons across the universe. Although the last two chapters were overly technical, the book overall was fantastic and scratched the surface on a number of topics to look into further. "
76,0241304849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12087691-wendyb,4,"Interesting, easily readable. Covers a lot of territory (no pun intended) in space exploration but not in much depth, just gives an overview of subjects related to rocketry, life in space and the possibilities of humans living on other worlds."

I think this would make a better podcast series, breaking it down into more easily digestible sections. But perhaps I'm just not a serious enough space-nerd to fully enjoy ALL the material presented!"

Topics range from propulsion systems to AI and biological enhancements. While a number of the author's ideas are not particularly convincing, virtually all are interesting."
80,0241304849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6991670-bob,4,"Summary: An exploration of the possibility and necessity of humanity becoming a multi-planetary species, and the revolutions of technology necessary to realize that future.Michio Kaku is a theoretical theorist studying string theory at the City University of New York, and the author of a series of best-selling futurist works based on his knowledge of physics and other fields. He is also a riveting, passionate speaker who believes, along with others like Elon Musk, that we must envision becoming a multi-planetary species. This, the latest of his books, explores that idea, it's necessity, and the technological advances that could make this possible.Kaku argument for the necessity of becoming a multi-planetary species is rooted in the priority of the survival of the human species. He is convinced that, whether through physical causes ranging from cataclysmic volcanoes to asteroids or the final death throes of the sun, our planet will become unlivable for human beings--if we do not accomplish this first through human causation as in nuclear holocaust or global warming. Discussing other great challenges we've faced through history, he writes:But now we face perhaps the greatest challenge of all: to leave the confines of the Earth and soar into outer space. The laws of physics are clear; sooner or later we will face global crises that threaten our very existence. (p.6)In three parts he explores the technologies that can make this possible. The first part explores interplanetary settlement efforts within our solar system, using moon as a base, and Mars as our first settlement, and later possibly settling, or exploiting the resources of the large moons orbiting the gas giants of Jupiter and Saturn. He describes existing efforts by public and private enterprise to return to the moon and create settlements on Mars. This itself is formidable considering exposures to radioactivity and the inhospitable nature of the planet but he argues for the eventual possibility of terra-forming Mars, making it livable and life sustaining. What is fascinating is that much of this is possible by applying and extending our current technology, albeit at great cost.The second part of the book seemed like something out of Star Trek, exploring the technologies of interstellar travel. All of this is beyond our current technologies. As a physicist, he takes us on a tour of possible technologies from nanoships and laser and solar sail propelled vehicles, to ramjet fusion and antimatter engines, and proposes that the warp drive of The Enterprise is possible, and consists not in propelling one faster than light, but literally warping space so that a vessel is pulled through it at hyper light speeds. Nearly all of this requires inordinately great quantities of energy, and presupposes a level of civilization at which we harness, first the energies of the sun, and than galactic levels of energy. This will allow us to explore at least the nearby stars or further into a galaxy of stars where it is increasingly evident that there are many possible habitable planets.The third part explores the reality that the great distances to be traveled, even should we exceed the speed of light, either require multi-generational crews, or advances toward immortality. He explores research on curing aging, on trans-humanism in which humans and machines become increasingly integrated. He discusses the Human Connectome Project, in which human neural networks are mapped, digitized, and potentially could be reproduced light years away, transmitted via laser networks. He also speculates on the existence of other more advanced civilizations. He mentions observations of recurring drops in energy output of star KIC 8462852 by as much as 30 percent positing an object 22 times as large as Jupiter, speculating that one possibility would be a megastructure like a Dyson sphere constructed by an alien civilization.This part also gets into Kaku's area of theoretical physics, string theory, as he explores the possibility of travel through wormholes and stargates and perhaps even escaping the present universe into one of many multiverses, particularly useful when this one burns out.Whew! Kaku's tour of the technologies necessary for interstellar travel is both breathtaking, and staggering. On one hand, much of the technology we use today, even that I am using as I write, was science fiction in my childhood. It is always dangerous to scoff at what seems impossible. The cell phone at my side represents applications of theoretical physics unknown 150 years ago in terms of the miniaturized circuitry and memory, cellular and wi-fi capabilities, GPS tracking, and touch screens. What would have been an object of wonder 150 years ago is now a commonplace of many of our lives. Yet what Kaku describes in this book, particularly in parts two and three, strings together ventures of immense cost, requiring unimaginable amounts of power, huge quantities of rare (and dangerous) resources like anti-matter, as well as scenarios, the survivability of which are in question, all of which to preserve the human species on a multi-planetary scale. Of course Kaku allows millenia for reaching such capabilities.The most credible part of the book for me was the near-term ideas of travel to Mars, perhaps even establishing some form of outpost there. If something of a cataclysmic nature were to occur on Earth in the next couple centuries, such an outpost might preserve civilization, and even re-settle earth. Even this is tremendously costly as well as risky. We must expect lives to be lost, even as they were among other explorers and settlers throughout our history. But it also raised questions of several sorts.Some were questions of priority. Should we think of terra-forming Mars when our own planet's earth, water and air need so much attention? Should we pour huge funds and inordinate amounts of energy into space travel when transport on earth is still carbon-based and polluting? When we are not yet addressing preventable diseases of childhood, and providing quality and affordable health care on a global basis, is it right to pour huge amounts into life-extending technologies that may benefit a select few? Or even as we think about planetary defense, might we focus on technologies for detection and destruction of planet-threatening objects from outer space? All this falls under the question of caring for the planet and people that we have before we think about settling other worlds.Some are more fundamental questions having to do with whether we ought to do these things. I think of this particularly around the discussion of immortality. Kaku fails to deal with the issue of whether it is a good thing for humans with our flawed as well as noble nature to live for ever. Have you ever noticed how, as people age, they become who they always were, to an even greater degree? We may grow both more loving and more neurotic. We may grow more knowledgeable and more petty. The closest he gets to this is when he quotes the late Stephen Hawking who said, ""We only have to look at ourselves to see how intelligent life might develop into something we wouldn't want to meet."" In my own faith tradition, we believe that it is a severe mercy of God that flawed and fallen people don't live endlessly in our bodies and that hope is found not in endless mortal life, but life everlasting beyond bodily death.Finally, I am troubled with the hubristic strains that carry as much attraction for many contemporary hearers as they did for the first couple in the garden, and the tower builders of Babel. Kaku writes:...our destiny is to become the gods we once feared and worshipped. Science will give us the means by which we can shape the universe in our image. The question is whether we will have the wisdom of Solomon to accompany this vast celestial power. (p. 14)""You shall be as gods"" has been a temptation from the very beginning, and is one this book proffers to its readers. Along with that temptation comes tower-building (or space elevator) projects that reflect our pitiful efforts to offset our creaturely vulnerabilities. Will we exchange dependence on the sustenance of the Creator and responsible care for the world we've been given for anxious and costly efforts to preserve ourselves in other worlds, and perhaps neglect the most vulnerable on our own planet? I find the reference to Solomon fascinating, because the record tells us that, while wise, he abandoned the fear of God which is the beginning of wisdom, giving himself to building projects that taxed and enslaved, and that he multiplied wives and experiences. If Ecclesiastes gives us the final verdict on this project, it is all summed up as ""meaningless,"" ""a chasing after the wind,"" and that ""with much wisdom comes much sorrow."" It seems that this is what always comes of trying to make ourselves gods, and trying to stave off death when a universe of wonder and a world of beauty to be cared for beckons us to trust its Maker."

The first and foremost thought I had while reading this book was how shockingly poor my knowledge in astronomy was. The book covers a vast variety of concepts pertaining to universe, space travel, relativity, quantum theory, time travel and other likes written in a lucid fashion."
82,0241304849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1639329-erik,2,"A mile wide, an inch deep. It's simple to the point of being erroneous: He'll spend a single sentence glossing over a profound problem that'll take billions of manhours to resolve. Not to mention some truly stupid claims in here, such as his belief that only human beings (as opposed to other animals) possess an awareness of time. That's incorrect by inspection.And worse - it's boring. It feels less like ""The Future of Humanity"" and more like ""Cliffnotes of the Future of Humanity."" You would be vastly better served reading a science fiction book that explores these ideas of interstellar travel, generation arks, AI, etc. The Martian; The Expanse; etc, etc.BUT one major positive is just how much research this book inspired me into. It has a lot of references to real and underway projects. Following up on these was both fun and informative."
83,0241304849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22189980-belhor,3,"Interesting enough. Kaku is easy to read and I love the fact that he always quotes lots of interesting people in his writing. This book is the second book from Kaku that I've read, and even though I liked his ""Parallel Worlds"" more, this one is also a pretty decent book. I would have liked if he went through a little more details specially in the first chapters. The book gets better when you are almost halfway through."
84,0241304849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21091961-jacques-bezuidenhout,3,"Nice, easy to follow explanation of scientific concepts, and how humans are likely to evolve in future.I might have given the book a higher rating if I didn't already touch on most of the concepts discussed in other books:The Space Barons: Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, and the Quest to Colonize the CosmosHomo Deus: A Brief History of TomorrowA Short History of Nearly EverythingThere is quite a bit of overlap.This book is a nice summary putting the relevant information together and sequencing them chronologically.This book is also fairly new. So some of the facts contained goes up to things happening in 2017, which is nice.The latter part of the book touching on quantum and string theory, starts going over one's head a bit. Although explained as simple as possible, it does become a bit difficult to follow in audio format. You also need to be really open minded to get your head around some of the concepts / possibilities presented for the future. Since most are speculative, and mostly relies on things humans aren't even close to achieving."
85,0241304849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/93786551-nirali-lakdawala,4,"Its an amazing book and it takes you to space and beyond.

86,0241304849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60980219-catherine-cole,5,"Although scientists might think the explanations given to the topics in this book may be a little too ""dumbed-down"" for their liking, they must remember that this book is for general audiences, who may not have the same knowledge or vocabulary as they do, therefore, simple explanations and comparisons to situations the non-scientific population can understand are necessary.This book takes you on a journey from the very first notions of rockets to hypothetic scenarios where you can transport your consciousness in laser beams to planets beyond our galaxy, and even escape the end of this universe.Many fascinating theories for space travel, building stations and ports in moons and asteroids, modifying our bodies to adapt to a non-planetary existence, and the different types of civilizations we might become, make this an eye/mind-opening read. Plus, it is a treasure chest of ideas for science fiction writers, who do not have the limitations of time or budget to make new realities come true on a page."
87,0241304849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73029907-cav,5,"This was an exceptionally well-formatted and written book. I really enjoyed it. This is my first from author Michio Kaku, but won't be my last.Kaku writes with a very engaging style, that holds the reader's attention effortlessly. This is a welcome change to many, many other science books I have read that are plagued by long-winded, esoteric and dry writing.The book is written in an easy-to-follow manner that would be suitable for the layperson who may be not too familiar with science. Kaku is an extremely effective science communicator; he takes complicated ideas, and conveys them in a simple and easy to understand manner. We need many more like him, IMHO.As mentioned, the book's formatting is excellent, as well. It is broken down into 3 main parts:
1) LEAVING THE EARTH2) VOYAGE TO THE STARS3) LIFE IN THE UNIVERSE
Which then break further down into different chapters. Kaku ends most chapters with a really natural segway to the upcoming one. The book has an excellent flow to it.If you were a fan of sci-fi as a kid, or are curious about what the future has in store for the human race, then this book is for you. The Future of Humanity covers (among many others): *The history of rockets; pioneers Goddard and von Braun.*Missions to the moon and Mars; the possibilities of living on either.*The asteroid belt, and possibilities of mining them.*The gas giants, Venus, Titan, and other moons.*Robotics, AI, and self-replicating robots.*Transhumanism*Spaceships; different theoretical technologies, and rocket types.*Black holes, wormholes, and spacetime.*The possibility of life on other worlds.*String theory and multiverses.I thoroughly enjoyed this book, and would most definitely recommend it to anyone interested in astronomy, physics, and the future of humanity in general. It is a big-picture book, with many incredible ideas that are sure to capture your imagination.5 stars, and a spot on my ""Favorites"" shelf."
88,0241304849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25338445-angie-reisetter,3,"Kaku is a great tour guide to the possibilities of the distant future. He imagines what may be possible, or at least what is not ruled out by the laws of physics as we know them. He has the tendency in this book, as he does in his others, to introduce topics with words like ""perhaps"" and ""might"", and then to drop them altogether, so that it sounds like he is telling us what will happen, casting aside minor difficulties like cost and human will. He threads science fiction references throughout his narrative, almost organizing his argument by what he's seen/read in science fiction. That's not a terrible way to go, but he also blurs the line of reality there, asking himself how we reconcile two different views of the future, as if they are not fictional and must be reconciled. The whole thing is very entertaining. But he has a theorist's tendency to discount reality, which is always my criticism of his work. But I did come back for more, and his work is always worth reading. A little inspiration is called for right about now.There seem to be a number of science futures becoming available in the near future, and I've recently read Soonish: Ten Emerging Technologies That'll Improve and/or Ruin Everything, which is very different from this one. I recommend them both as a study in contrasts: Kaku's extends to the limits of what might be possible one day maybe, and Soonish tries to keep it, well, soonish, in the realm of the reasonably possible. They have some topics in common, but they diverge rather dramatically.I got a copy to review from Net Galley."

I'd love it if you'd check me out and consider following/subscribing.You know, there is a crazy need that people have to judge a book by its title. It almost never is the case that that is what a book is on about. Perhaps a more accurate title would be: This is what Star Trek envisions and here's the status on where we're at. In that case, the book is amazing b/c it's quite hard to get that accomplished. If you look at the sea of references in the back and also read it, you'll realize how difficult it was to write something that is this comprehensive, albiet, much of detais of his reference are in the footnotes. p. 2 - He talks about the similarities between humans vs. chimps as a cohort a supposes that some cataclysmic event took out the genetic diversity that once was.p. 20 ""The amount of fuel you need reises exponentially with the change in velocity so that enormous amounts of fuel are needed to give an extra boost to speed."" (ok, a little wordy. What he's saying is it's hard to increasingly acceleration (that's what change in velocity is). You're going to need to accellorate for a while and at a crazy high speed if you want to leave earth for another planet. They are pretty far away.p. 32 - He deals with some of the politics and economics. He talks about it being easier to fund a person going into space vs program itself. As a result, many compromises (as that's more expensive to support life vs. just do unmanned missions).p. 33 - ""It takes $10k to put a pound of anything up in space.""p. 34 - The story of the great imperial fleet of Admiral Zheng 1405 - 1433. I really want to look thi up, b/c this was a big deal as relates to why there are Chinese people in specific places on the earth like Madagascar. Glad to finally get a citation. p. 40 Jules Verne's method of shooting someone to the moon predates rocket fuel. That's a major innovation. Blue Origin - company by Bezo's rocket system is called New ShepardElon Musk's Space X is called Falcon Rocket.p. 41Blue origin is billing it as a tourism voyage with an orientation.p. 43 Beso's vision: ""The whole idea is to perserve the Earth... The goal [is] to be able to evacuate humans. The planet would become a park."" All the waste would be ejected into space. In 2017 he announced his plans: ""Once considered a lonely outpost in space, the moon would become a bustling industrial and commercial hub with permanent manned bases and manufacturing."" p. 44 Moon Express plans on mining the moon.p. 45 The outer space treaty does not contain any language related to real estate ownership of the moon and it's annoying to many people to think of it.p. 47 - The book moves into the other tech that has to exist if you're legit going to go the moon. The first has to do with medical care. Robots need to get better for things like remote-controlled surgery. Similarly a lot more work has to go in withstanding radiation.p. 50 Talks about how the moon was formed through a huge impact billions of years ago. The Earth looked like packman and the Moon a slice. All that changed through gravity.p. 62 - Musk's company's vision to Mars...he's on track to try to send a manned mission to mars by 2024. Typically estimates have said it would cost betwen $400-500b. He's trying to do it for $10bln. He's trying to get the price down per ride to $200k so that it competes with Virgin's galactic SpaceShipTwo. There's also pricing for the Russian rocket International Space Station which is $20-40m. I never knew the price of this stuff. Nice.p. 67 The total failure (which is always fatal) of going into space is about 1.5% (3 failures out of 135) with the fatality count being about 3.3%. With mars, most satellites do not make it there (3/4ths do not).p. 85 - MDRS Mars Desert Research station attempts to make realistic situations to determine the psychological effects of being on MARS.p. 87 - Terraforming in terms of DNA. There is an idea that DNA came from Mars and transformed the earth. p. 93 - They believe that MARS lost its magnetic field (necessary to protect the planet) from heavy bombardment. It's why the core is solid vs. lava like ours.p. 94 - ""The Earth is larger than Mars, so it did not coll down as quickly. The Earth also did not suffer a collapse of its magnetic field caused by giant meteor impacts."" p. 99 - Some people want to break off a piece of Europa and bring it to mars to repopulate the planet with water.p. 103 - Titan has atmosphere and would actually support life, though we'd stll need a few other things. p. 116 - The use of AI to help explore the planets in preparation for human entrance. Or alternatively,we just move our organic body into a computer one so we can enjoy space travel.p. 118 - He introduces Neural Networks p. 121 - Self-replicating robots are necessary in space. this describes what they have to be like.p. 129 He has a theory that humans differ from animals b/c we notice time. I'm not 100% sure I agree. but ok.p. 156 HE talks about the challenge of stopping a rocket ship.p. 158 The space elevator is another option often tossed around.p. 169 Parallax. didn't know that word.p. 170 - Talks about how we find planets with minor dimming of light.p. 178 talks about rogue planets.p. 190 sets up for the idea that medical drives the ability of humans to expand into new territories.Solving aging (telemeers) is about allowing us to go to space.p. 204 Again putting you in a robot might work.p. 206 - They talk about the exoskeleton and where that's at.p. 211 - The chip in glasses to type out a sentence is early stage communication via just neural activity.p. 226- What if alliens are WAY ahead of us? p. 233 - It almost goes backward in talking about what makes Humans the best on earth. It's not b/c we are strong We are actually worthless in strengh and other characteristics.p. 248 A dyson sphere is created around a star to harness the energy that comes off of it.p. 258 They are looking for someone that has done this in the galaxy to see if some other species has left a big footprint like we have on earth. So far, no luck.p. 261 Talks about how DNA can demonstrate the rate of divergence/mutation. It's really slow. Weird would have thought it would be driven by the amount/speed of procreation. p. 323 A great reading list. I'd like to one day take a look at all of these books."

92,0241304849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22443749-debbie,4,"4.5 starsThe Future of Humanity is a fascinating piece of speculative astrophysics and science which seeks to explore the various ways humanity may expand our civilization across the universe. I thoroughly enjoyed how in depth Kaku got, not just laying out the potential opportunities but also fully explaining the science behind the theories. Despite this heavily scientific approach, this book never felt boring or overwhelming. Even if some of the topics were a little far-fetched, it was nevertheless an intriguing and engaging read.—75,000 years ago there was a major volcanic eruption (Topa); considered the biggest eruption in the past 25 million years. Some scientists speculate only 2,000 humans remained and had to repopulate, which is why DNA between people even if they’re not related is surprisingly similarWhen you consider every single creature that has ever lived on the earth such as amoebas, plants, dinosaurs etc., you find that 99.9% have gone extinct, meaning the creatures and living things that are alive today are an extremely small sliver of all the living things that have ever lived on the planetOur earth has gone through 5 major extinction cycles in our history, in which up to 90% of the living species went extinct at a timeBecause our galaxy has 100 billion stars there may be as many as 20 billion Earth sized planets in the Milky Way galaxy. it’s estimated there is 2 billion trillion earth sized planets in the visible universe including galaxies outside our ownThere is actually gravity in space and the feeling/illusion of weightlessness is because everything falls at the same rate so astronauts are falling at the same rate as the spaceshipIn the future, we may use the moon as a gas station, because ice at the South Pole can be used to farm oxygen and hydrogen which are primary components of rocket fuel, and also rare earth metals found there as well which are also able to be made into fuel. Helium 3 is also expected to be on the moon, which can be used for Fusion reactors. There is also talk of finding platinum. All this raises the question of whether it’s legal to mine on the moon and if so who can stake a claim on itIf we built a living space on the moon, at first it would need to be sent supplies from Earth every few weeks. The astronauts could use Internet, cell phones etc. as normal once they set up the proper technology because the delay between earth and the moon is only one second. They could potentially farm oxygen from the soil and water from the ice caps. The bases may be built underground to protect from solar radiation. There will need to be large amounts of solar panels because a moon day lasts an Earth month, so there are 2 weeks of day followed by 2 weeks of nightYour blood boils in the vacuum of space because as pressure drops the boiling point of water also dropsAstroids contain iron, nickel, carbon & cobalt, as well as significant quantities of rare earth metals and valuable metals including irradium, platinum, and rodium. It is believed that we will eventually mine the astroid belt, and many entrepreneurs have already expressed interest in finding ways to do so. 12 astroids have already been identified as key targets for mining, because only a slight nudge to their orbit would bring them closer towards earth and the moon and able to enter into orbit, making mining them much more efficientElon musk‘s goal with space X is to reduce the cost of commercial space travel by 10x. He was the 1st to invent a reusable booster capsule module rather than discarding it after use. His ultimate goal is to make it to Mars. His goal is to send a manned mission to Mars by 2024. He envisions eventually the cost of sending someone to Mars will be $200,000/person round-tripIt only takes 3?days to get to the moon but 9 months to get to Mars. A round trip to Mars would take 2 years. Potential dangers during this deep space trip include excessive exposure to radiation, damage to the ship from solar flares or micro astroids, muscular atrophy from being in reduced gravity so long, and psychological side effectsNASA plans on having a manned mission arrive at Mars by 2033; this plan involves creating a lunar space station from which ships could go to Mars, rather than going directly to Mars like space XLike the moon, explorers on Mars would be able to harvest water, oxygen, and hydrogen from the permafrost and ice to serve as sources for water, oxygen, and fuel. The days on Mars are similar in length to days on earth, but the temperature is extremely cold, barely above the freezing point of water during the day and dropping drastically at night. Like the moon, the gravity is less so explorers would have to exercise daily to avoid muscular atrophy and loss of bone density. Mars has both water ice caps and dry ice/CO2 ice caps. The water ice caps stay consistent year round, but the dry ice caps fluctuate with the seasons and mostly evaporate in the summerFor Mars to become truly habitable, we would need to find a way to slowly heat the atmosphere so liquid water could flow on the surface, allowing for plants to grow outside of contained greenhouses. Terraforming mars is probably centuries away, and may be prohibitively costly. To artificially raise the temperature of the planet, we may inject water vapor and methane into the atmosphere to create a greenhouse effect, or send satellites into orbit over the ice caps to direct concentrated sunlight towards the caps to cause them to melt and release water vapor. Eventually, this warming process would become self-sustaining as well as increase the atmospheric pressure of mars. As plants grow and proliferate, dying plants will enrich the soil, and growing plants will add oxygen to the atmosphereMars cooled down slower than Earth did. Mars no longer has a molten core but rather a solid rock core, so it doesn’t have a magnetic field. This is one of the factors that accelerated Mars’s atmosphere loss. Also, the carbon dioxide is mostly trapped in the ground instead of proliferating in the atmosphere, causing a reverse greenhouse effectSome of the moons of the gas giants are also viewed as potential candidates for human coloniesThe gas giants are theorized to have a thick gaseous atmosphere, a cold liquid hydrogen ocean around the entire planet, and a small, solid hydrogen core because of the extreme pressures. Jupiter is surrounded by radiation, which causes Radio interference. The gravity of Jupiter actually helps protect the earth from being bombarded by astroids because it essentially serves as a vacuum cleanerTitan (a moon of Saturn) is a potential candidate for human colonization, but because it’s so far away it can’t have self-sustaining greenhouse effect, and the lakes of ethane Could combust if it got too hot. But it could be a source of fuel. And it’s one of the few places in our solar system where we would be able to go outside without a spacesuit because it has enough of an atmosphere that our blood wouldn’t boil/we wouldn’t be crushed (we’d still need an oxygen mask). Europa (a moon of Jupiter) has potential for microbial life in its ocean (which sits under the layer of ice that encircles the moon, and was made possible because of friction caused from the extreme tidal forces caused by Jupiter’s gravity)All the gas giants have rings, which are likely caused by moons that got too close to the planet being torn apart by the planet’s gravityTitan and the Kuiper belt would most likely serve as refueling stations or points from which to jump to the next star or planetGraphene/carbon nanotubes will likely be the material used to make infrastructure on other planets, because it’s immensely strong yet incredibly light. We’re not at a point yet where we can mass produce it, because even a small impurity can ruin it, but once we have the technology to do so, it’ll be the best material to use. It could even be used to create skin-tight, lightweight spacesuitsFor Interstellar and planetary colonization to be realistic, we would need automatons—robots with more intelligence than our current ones who can perform a wide variety of tasks such as building cities on planets and moons, which would be easier for a robot (doesn’t need a spacesuit, doesn’t get affected by radiation, isn’t limited by oxygen supply, etc)Getting robots to understand common sense has been extremely difficult and currently prevents them from fully perceiving and navigating the world. Currently robots need human intervention to do most tasks. Modern robots will likely be a combination of top down and bottom up learning; they will have some information already integrated into their systems but they will also have neural networks that will allow them to learn from repetition and gain common sense. Robots would also need to be self replicatingIon engines may make it possible for the trip to Mars to take 40 days rather than 9 monthsPotential energy sources for traveling at the speed of light include light sailing (propelling with lasers), nuclear energy (propelling with nuclear explosions), and antimatter energy. an antimatter rocket would have 100% energy efficiency, whereas nuclear explosion only has 1% because most of the Energy is wasted. However only a very small amount of anti-matter exists naturally, so we would have to manufacture it (currently extremely expensive). Storing the antimatter would be difficult because it would have to be stored in a trap that suspends it in a magnetic field so it’s not able to touch the edges of the container; if it touch the edges it would destroy the containerSomething that would help make getting materials into space much easier and more economical is creating a space elevator that stretches from the surface of the earth out above our atmosphere. Scientists predict that it is theoretically possible to do so, possibly even by 2035, but we would need to find a way to make enough strong enough Materials for this to be feasible. Ideally pure carbon nanotubes would be used, but right now it would be difficult to make as much as would be neededTo travel faster than light at warp speed, we need to find a way to make vast quantities of negative matter or negative energy. We’ve been able to make small amounts of negative energy, but we are nowhere close to producing the amount needed to even consider developing warp drivesSuspended animation/cryogenic freezing to allow longer voyages without needing generations of people to live on a spaceship is currently not possible. While other animals are able to survive in suspended animation because of the levels of glucose in their blood which prevents their blood from freezing, the amount of sugar needed is too high for humansTelomeres are part of our chromosomes that get shorter with aging; when they get too short the cells can no longer divide. If we can prevent that shortening from happening, it would increase our life span because our cells would be able to divide and replicate themselves longer. However, cancer operates in the same way and is essentially immortal, so that would be a riskIf we were able to identify exactly what parts of our genetic make up contribute to aging, we could alter our genes to expand our life expectancyAging is thought to be the accumulation of errors in our genetic make up over time, so if we can prevent those errors from happening because of deteriorating cell replication then we can slow down the aging processIf we were able to somehow make ourselves inmortal, or drastically increase our life expectancy, then we would likely have to deal with extreme overpopulation eventually. Before the Industrial Revolution, the human population of the earth was 300 million or less. It has now grown to 7.5 billion and is anticipated to increase by 1 billion every 12 years. It is estimated that there will be 11.2 billion people on the earth by 2100. However, others argued that our increase in population is slowly going down and will stabilize before we reach a level of overpopulationA primate has never been cloned. If we come to the point where human cloning is possible, it is likely that only a small percentage of the population would do so. It is also speculated that eventually we will find ways to modify our genes or enhance our bodies through cybernetics, but we will likely not take it so far that we drastically modify our appearance. Modifications would likely be improvements to existing issues (ex: eyesight) or ways to improve our social standing, rather than becoming creatures with giant heads and huge eyes and skinny bodies. Our use of cybernetics would prevent us from evolving that drastically. If we were to disperse in colonies across the galaxy, our genetic makeup would remain within 0.1% difference between colonies (same as between humans currently)We may in the next century or so develop ways to laser port our consciousness across the galaxy so our physical bodies could remain in place while our consciousness is able to move at the speed of light to visit other places by being ported it into an avatarEarth like planets need to be accompanied by large gaseous Jupiter like planets to clear out incoming astroids. They also need to be accompanied by a larger moon to stabilize their spin and trajectoryThe drake equation attempts to estimate the probability that we will make contact with intelligent life forms; however there is still a lot of unknowns that prevent us from having an accurate assessment from this equationIf there are intelligent beings on other planets, we can’t assume that they communicate vocally the same way we do. They might communicate through pheromones like bugs, or sonar like batsIntelligent life will likely follow the laws of evolution. An intelligent species will likely be descended from predators, so it will have forward facing eyes. They will also likely have opposable thumbs or some type of grasping appendage. They will also have some form of languageKardishev scale of civilizations: A type 1 civilization (planetary) uses all the energy of the sunlight that falls on the planet. Type 2 civilization (stellar) uses all the energy it’s sun produces. A type 3 civilization (galactic) uses the energy of an entire galaxy. We are currently a type 0.7 civilization because we’re not using the full energy of all the sunlight shining on our planet. We are about a century or two away from becoming a full type 1, and possibly A few thousand years from becoming a type 2. We might not become type 3 for 100,000 years or even up to 1 million because it requires a level of interstellar travel that we’re nowhere close to having. The energy measurements for each type just means and equivalent amount of energy, it doesn’t mean you have to be getting all your energy from the sun. Each next level of civilization is between 10 to 100 billion times more powerful than the previous typeA civilization that has reached type 2 is likely nearly immortal, and most of its energy generating machinery will likely be placed off planet because there will be so much energy being produced that it creates too much heat for the planet to be habitable. They will likely also harvest energy from their sun through a Dyson sphere and because of the vast quantities they are harvesting Will emit infrared radiationThere is another scale of civilization that is calculated based on the amount of information it consumes as proposed by Carl Sagan. Type A civilization consumes 1,000,000 bits of information. Type Z civilization consumes a 10^31 bits of information. We are a type H civilization. By this scale a type two civilization would be able to consume energy through widely distributed Dyson sphere, harvesting from astroids, developing super efficient nano technology, etc. and avoid giving up the levels of infrared radiation that would make it detectable to usOur first encounter with alien civilization will likely be a robotic self replicating probeString theory exists in 10 dimensions. It cancels out quantum corrections, basically meaning it cancels out the fact that quantum things like electrons and protons are able to be in multiple places at once. This quantum cancellation can only happen in 10 dimensions. The pairing for particles in string theory is sparticles, quarks are squarks, etc. String theory assumes an infinite number of universes (Multiverse). String theory says the universe was originally 10 dimensions, then for some reason the other 6 dimensions “curled up” leaving us with only 4 perceivable dimensionsDark matter was discovered because astrophysicist realized that the Milky Way was spinning 10 times faster than Newtonian physics would allow without flying apart, so they realize there must be some invisible thing adding all that extra mass to the galaxy. Dark matter is invisible, but it bends starlight so we’re able to detect it that way. Dark matter has gravity, but can’t be held/interact with matter in any way. It’s electrically neutral and only interacts with gravity. However we’ve never been able to officially prove that dark matter exist yet or create it ourselves in any way. Once we do, it will prove string theoryString theory is the only way would be able to do calculations about the quantum corrections needed for time travel, going through a wormhole, faster than light travel, etcThe universe is expected to eventually end in 1 of 3 ways: the big crunch, the big freeze, or the big rip. The big crunch is when the expansion of the universe slow down, stops, and reverses itself, eventually coalescing in a giant wad of superheated matter and possibly eventually turning into another big bang. For the big freeze, by the laws of entropy eventually the stars will stop shining, the sky will go black and temperature will reach absolute zero wherein matter nearly ceases to move. The big rip refers to the fact that the universe is exponentially expanding far faster than anticipated, and that distant galaxies will eventually speed away from us faster than the speed of light and disappear. Eventually our galaxy and solar system would be torn apart from this rapid expansion. The universe would end in an explosion, a singularity of infinite energyOur sun will exhaust its energy in about 5 billion years; it will expand into a red giant star which will essentially set the earth on fire, mountains will melt, oceans will boil, and the earth will be engulfed. After this, the sun will exhaust all its nuclear fuel and shrink and go cold as a white dwarf and then die as a dark dwarf star. In 4.8 billion years, the Milky Way and Andromeda galaxy’s will collide. There are two black holes will collide and merge and a new galaxy will eventually be formedDark energy is the energy of a vacuum. It acts like antigravity, and it pushes the universe apart. It is different than dark matter. The more the universe expands, the more dark energy there is, which makes the universe expand faster. About 69% of the matter/energy in the universe is contained in dark energy. Dark matter makes up 26%. Atoms of hydrogen and helium make up about 5%. And other higher elements that make up the earth, our bodies, etc. only make up 0.5%A possible way to overcome the eventual death of our universe is by becoming a type 4 civilization that harnesses extragalactic energy like dark energy and is able to reverse the big rip by creating a sphere in which dark energy reverses polarity so that inside the sphere The galaxies continue to survive normally while outside the sphere the universe is continuing to expand rapidly and tear itself apart. Another possible solution is that we find a way to leave our universe and go to one of the other theoretical bubble universes in the Multiverse. They could use negative energy to create a wormhole. The bubble universes are floating in a 10 dimensional arena—Read for the Astronomy prompt for the 2019 OWLs Readathon"

The second reason for listening twice is that it is chock full of info that is easy to miss in an audio format - so I also downloaded the Kindle version...I love Michio Kaku’s books. This one is about fun science of the future. Space travel - where are we, what do we still need to do, where would we go, how would we need to alter ourselves for outer space, what spacecrafts would we use, etc. Fun stuff, all told in an approachable, interesting story format. Kaku loves science fiction and peppers the narrative with movie and book references. Interestingly enough, he judges most of it more science and less fiction. Kaku is a physics professor, thus the physics are very solid; but I have my doubts on some of the biotechnology parts. Nevertheless, a thoroughly enjoyable book that I ended up listening to within about a day."
94,0241304849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8686546-feyzan---the-raven-boy,3,"3.5 starsthe journey of a thousand miles begins with the first stepI don't know what I was thinking when I picked this book up. I don't usually like to read books that are dense with physics and cosmology, but I admire michio kaku so i had to give this one a try. I am not surprised to feel disappointed, however. This book was pretty good on entertainment, and I understand why nerds would love it, but it did nothing for me, except maybe entertain a little. I couldn't take this book seriously as it was brimming with speculations about things that may or may not happen in next 5 billion years. I mean instead of worrying about what will happen in 5 billion years shouldn't we focus on saving our planet from all the man made chaos?I enjoyed the science fiction elements and reading about how tenaciously scientists are trying to make science fiction a new reality for humanity. It was all very interesting to read. The book covered many topics like terraforming, multi-verse, robotics, transhumanism. All these heavy and dense topic were easier to grasp and understand thanks to michio kaku's writing style and movie references. It feels like a new war is in order between the richest people of the world as they compete to colonize Mars and the universe itself. I think these rich people, Instead of spending billions of dollars on space exploration and planning to colonize other planets, should spend some of their foturne and influence to make this planet safe for everyone, Just saying. When I was a kid I used to dream about meeting aliens, going on a mission to space and whatnot. My imaginations used to very elaborated,  I used to imagine alines and robots in a very fanciful way. Robots used to have chips inside of them that could shut them off, if they tried to take over the world. Then I grew up. However, reading this book made me realize that some people are incapable of growing up.
 When self-aware robots do arrive, we must add a fail-safe chip that will shut them off if they have murderous thoughts.
I mean, first of all, no self aware robot is arriving anytime soon. Second of all, no self-aware robot will insert a chip inside of itself (I forgot to mention these robots are supposed to be self-replicating too.) Anyway, you get the idea this book is high on speculation and overflowing with head-scratching logic.
In 2017, a controversy arose between two billionaires, Mark Zuckerberg, founder of Facebook, and Elon Musk of SpaceX and Tesla. Zuckerberg maintained that artificial intelligence was a great generator of wealth and prosperity that will enrich all of society. Musk, however, took a much darker view and stated that AI actually posed an existential risk to all of humanity, that one day our creations may turn on us.
Wow, this exactly what we needed to be discussing right now. 🙄 Zuckerbergs' first concern should be to be make Facebook safe and secure again, not this. And then this book celebrate psychotic maniacs and call them heroes. 
 He confided to me that he takes several hundred pills a day, anticipating his own immortality
I guess, this book isn't meant to be taken seriously. It's just good to get inside the heads of scientists and learn how they operate and how they see the future. This book has imbued me with unnecessary knowledge that I don't know where and how to use. This knowledge is increasing my, already soaring, existential angst that wont rest until I use this knowledge somewhere. Anyway, this book isn't bad. It just wasn't for me. I am sure nerds and Sci-fi fans will love it."

Kaku addresses the possibilities of setting up permanent bases on the moon and terraforming Mars. At some point, humanity will need to move beyond the solar system to settle planets revolving around nearby stars.

It really normalizes the thoughts of leaving Earth and not only exploring beyond, but settling beyond.

Reading "" The future of humanity"", I thought about many serious subjects and my mind was blowing up with interesting informations about almost everything. From space to physics theories, everything was explained in simple words and that was the beauty of this book. Reading this book gives you a clear insight about the future of us as humans and discusses several probable possibilities in the long life span of humankind during his/her adventure in the space.

99,0241304849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7258380-dan-graser,4,"In his latest work, physicist Michio Kaku has focused on the what the future life of humanity might be as pertains to several possible scenarios. Throughout the work he mostly does a decent job of suggesting how plausible these ideas are, or at the very least, the type of timeframe needed to develop the requisite technological capabilities to achieve them. Beginning with the colonization of Mars, Kaku does a fine job of explaining just how this very popular notion would have to work, the costs involved, where our current capabilities stand, and just who is at the forefront of this quest. As NASA continues to be underfunded, though they do have a Mars program in operation, private funding has taken over much of this territory and the competition created by these developments is changing just how (some, particularly wealthy) humans may leave this planet for good.Next Kaku takes up the idea of interstellar travel. This is one area where the type of technology required is hundreds of years away. This distances to other star systems is staggering, our technology still primitive, and the pace at which we could develop any sort of device traveling remotely close to the speed of light is very difficult to predict. Some hugely interesting ideas are posited but he is quick to note that many of these are at the moment very unrealistic.The intersection of AI and humanity is discussed but not in particularly great detail. I would recommend Max Tegmark on this subject as his picture is a bit more complete. Anyone who has read the literature on this likely already has a more thorough understanding than is presented in this section.Finally and perhaps most significantly, Kaku details what physics tells us about the end of space and time and the possibility to forestall these dire (though billions of years in the future) events with technology developed to harness the gravitational effect of dark matter and dark energy. As we still have no idea as to the workings of either of these this is of course purely speculative but this is the first I've heard of these compelling ideas. As with all of his books, Kaku is an engaging and accessible writer that only occasionally veers into oversimplification or inclusion of ideas purely for their mass appeal, not for their plausibility. This is an effective summary of where we are as pertains to the possible routes humanity might take to ensure, at the level of our entire species, our survival. Wonderful reading all around."

Unlike pessimists like Harari who fear human life becoming meaningless by advances in AI, he imagines using progresses in technology to settle and terraform Mars and elsewhere ! The first section which focuses on near future technologies and space travel was an absolute delight.Also, his vision is not limited to the next decade or 20 years, he also talks about possibilities in the next 100 and 1000 years and even later. Except for the last chapters on wormholes and time-travel which felt weird, enjoyed this joyride. A bit like a spiritual guru the author was expanding my mind’s horizons with his thought-experiments.Will be reading more by this author."

However, I won’t penalize the book for introducing themes I happened to be already familiar with. Some physics stuff I found hard to follow but this could be due to the fact, I was listening to it as an audiobook. Some reviewers complained about the onslaught of the pop culture references but I enjoyed them and think they were pretty well incorporated into the text.

110,0241304849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6991670-bob,4,"Summary: An exploration of the possibility and necessity of humanity becoming a multi-planetary species, and the revolutions of technology necessary to realize that future.Michio Kaku is a theoretical theorist studying string theory at the City University of New York, and the author of a series of best-selling futurist works based on his knowledge of physics and other fields. He is also a riveting, passionate speaker who believes, along with others like Elon Musk, that we must envision becoming a multi-planetary species. This, the latest of his books, explores that idea, it's necessity, and the technological advances that could make this possible.Kaku argument for the necessity of becoming a multi-planetary species is rooted in the priority of the survival of the human species. He is convinced that, whether through physical causes ranging from cataclysmic volcanoes to asteroids or the final death throes of the sun, our planet will become unlivable for human beings--if we do not accomplish this first through human causation as in nuclear holocaust or global warming. Discussing other great challenges we've faced through history, he writes:But now we face perhaps the greatest challenge of all: to leave the confines of the Earth and soar into outer space. The laws of physics are clear; sooner or later we will face global crises that threaten our very existence. (p.6)In three parts he explores the technologies that can make this possible. The first part explores interplanetary settlement efforts within our solar system, using moon as a base, and Mars as our first settlement, and later possibly settling, or exploiting the resources of the large moons orbiting the gas giants of Jupiter and Saturn. He describes existing efforts by public and private enterprise to return to the moon and create settlements on Mars. This itself is formidable considering exposures to radioactivity and the inhospitable nature of the planet but he argues for the eventual possibility of terra-forming Mars, making it livable and life sustaining. What is fascinating is that much of this is possible by applying and extending our current technology, albeit at great cost.The second part of the book seemed like something out of Star Trek, exploring the technologies of interstellar travel. All of this is beyond our current technologies. As a physicist, he takes us on a tour of possible technologies from nanoships and laser and solar sail propelled vehicles, to ramjet fusion and antimatter engines, and proposes that the warp drive of The Enterprise is possible, and consists not in propelling one faster than light, but literally warping space so that a vessel is pulled through it at hyper light speeds. Nearly all of this requires inordinately great quantities of energy, and presupposes a level of civilization at which we harness, first the energies of the sun, and than galactic levels of energy. This will allow us to explore at least the nearby stars or further into a galaxy of stars where it is increasingly evident that there are many possible habitable planets.The third part explores the reality that the great distances to be traveled, even should we exceed the speed of light, either require multi-generational crews, or advances toward immortality. He explores research on curing aging, on trans-humanism in which humans and machines become increasingly integrated. He discusses the Human Connectome Project, in which human neural networks are mapped, digitized, and potentially could be reproduced light years away, transmitted via laser networks. He also speculates on the existence of other more advanced civilizations. He mentions observations of recurring drops in energy output of star KIC 8462852 by as much as 30 percent positing an object 22 times as large as Jupiter, speculating that one possibility would be a megastructure like a Dyson sphere constructed by an alien civilization.This part also gets into Kaku's area of theoretical physics, string theory, as he explores the possibility of travel through wormholes and stargates and perhaps even escaping the present universe into one of many multiverses, particularly useful when this one burns out.Whew! Kaku's tour of the technologies necessary for interstellar travel is both breathtaking, and staggering. On one hand, much of the technology we use today, even that I am using as I write, was science fiction in my childhood. It is always dangerous to scoff at what seems impossible. The cell phone at my side represents applications of theoretical physics unknown 150 years ago in terms of the miniaturized circuitry and memory, cellular and wi-fi capabilities, GPS tracking, and touch screens. What would have been an object of wonder 150 years ago is now a commonplace of many of our lives. Yet what Kaku describes in this book, particularly in parts two and three, strings together ventures of immense cost, requiring unimaginable amounts of power, huge quantities of rare (and dangerous) resources like anti-matter, as well as scenarios, the survivability of which are in question, all of which to preserve the human species on a multi-planetary scale. Of course Kaku allows millenia for reaching such capabilities.The most credible part of the book for me was the near-term ideas of travel to Mars, perhaps even establishing some form of outpost there. If something of a cataclysmic nature were to occur on Earth in the next couple centuries, such an outpost might preserve civilization, and even re-settle earth. Even this is tremendously costly as well as risky. We must expect lives to be lost, even as they were among other explorers and settlers throughout our history. But it also raised questions of several sorts.Some were questions of priority. Should we think of terra-forming Mars when our own planet's earth, water and air need so much attention? Should we pour huge funds and inordinate amounts of energy into space travel when transport on earth is still carbon-based and polluting? When we are not yet addressing preventable diseases of childhood, and providing quality and affordable health care on a global basis, is it right to pour huge amounts into life-extending technologies that may benefit a select few? Or even as we think about planetary defense, might we focus on technologies for detection and destruction of planet-threatening objects from outer space? All this falls under the question of caring for the planet and people that we have before we think about settling other worlds.Some are more fundamental questions having to do with whether we ought to do these things. I think of this particularly around the discussion of immortality. Kaku fails to deal with the issue of whether it is a good thing for humans with our flawed as well as noble nature to live for ever. Have you ever noticed how, as people age, they become who they always were, to an even greater degree? We may grow both more loving and more neurotic. We may grow more knowledgeable and more petty. The closest he gets to this is when he quotes the late Stephen Hawking who said, ""We only have to look at ourselves to see how intelligent life might develop into something we wouldn't want to meet."" In my own faith tradition, we believe that it is a severe mercy of God that flawed and fallen people don't live endlessly in our bodies and that hope is found not in endless mortal life, but life everlasting beyond bodily death.Finally, I am troubled with the hubristic strains that carry as much attraction for many contemporary hearers as they did for the first couple in the garden, and the tower builders of Babel. Kaku writes:...our destiny is to become the gods we once feared and worshipped. Science will give us the means by which we can shape the universe in our image. The question is whether we will have the wisdom of Solomon to accompany this vast celestial power. (p. 14)""You shall be as gods"" has been a temptation from the very beginning, and is one this book proffers to its readers. Along with that temptation comes tower-building (or space elevator) projects that reflect our pitiful efforts to offset our creaturely vulnerabilities. Will we exchange dependence on the sustenance of the Creator and responsible care for the world we've been given for anxious and costly efforts to preserve ourselves in other worlds, and perhaps neglect the most vulnerable on our own planet? I find the reference to Solomon fascinating, because the record tells us that, while wise, he abandoned the fear of God which is the beginning of wisdom, giving himself to building projects that taxed and enslaved, and that he multiplied wives and experiences. If Ecclesiastes gives us the final verdict on this project, it is all summed up as ""meaningless,"" ""a chasing after the wind,"" and that ""with much wisdom comes much sorrow."" It seems that this is what always comes of trying to make ourselves gods, and trying to stave off death when a universe of wonder and a world of beauty to be cared for beckons us to trust its Maker."

The first and foremost thought I had while reading this book was how shockingly poor my knowledge in astronomy was. The book covers a vast variety of concepts pertaining to universe, space travel, relativity, quantum theory, time travel and other likes written in a lucid fashion."
112,0241304849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1639329-erik,2,"A mile wide, an inch deep. It's simple to the point of being erroneous: He'll spend a single sentence glossing over a profound problem that'll take billions of manhours to resolve. Not to mention some truly stupid claims in here, such as his belief that only human beings (as opposed to other animals) possess an awareness of time. That's incorrect by inspection.And worse - it's boring. It feels less like ""The Future of Humanity"" and more like ""Cliffnotes of the Future of Humanity."" You would be vastly better served reading a science fiction book that explores these ideas of interstellar travel, generation arks, AI, etc. The Martian; The Expanse; etc, etc.BUT one major positive is just how much research this book inspired me into. It has a lot of references to real and underway projects. Following up on these was both fun and informative."
113,0241304849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22189980-belhor,3,"Interesting enough. Kaku is easy to read and I love the fact that he always quotes lots of interesting people in his writing. This book is the second book from Kaku that I've read, and even though I liked his ""Parallel Worlds"" more, this one is also a pretty decent book. I would have liked if he went through a little more details specially in the first chapters. The book gets better when you are almost halfway through."
114,0241304849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21091961-jacques-bezuidenhout,3,"Nice, easy to follow explanation of scientific concepts, and how humans are likely to evolve in future.I might have given the book a higher rating if I didn't already touch on most of the concepts discussed in other books:The Space Barons: Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, and the Quest to Colonize the CosmosHomo Deus: A Brief History of TomorrowA Short History of Nearly EverythingThere is quite a bit of overlap.This book is a nice summary putting the relevant information together and sequencing them chronologically.This book is also fairly new. So some of the facts contained goes up to things happening in 2017, which is nice.The latter part of the book touching on quantum and string theory, starts going over one's head a bit. Although explained as simple as possible, it does become a bit difficult to follow in audio format. You also need to be really open minded to get your head around some of the concepts / possibilities presented for the future. Since most are speculative, and mostly relies on things humans aren't even close to achieving."
115,0241304849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/93786551-nirali-lakdawala,4,"Its an amazing book and it takes you to space and beyond. The concepts are well explained & the way michio kaku talks about universe, the different ways to travel distance and the way we as a civilization will evolve is just superb."
116,0241304849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60980219-catherine-cole,5,"Although scientists might think the explanations given to the topics in this book may be a little too ""dumbed-down"" for their liking, they must remember that this book is for general audiences, who may not have the same knowledge or vocabulary as they do, therefore, simple explanations and comparisons to situations the non-scientific population can understand are necessary.This book takes you on a journey from the very first notions of rockets to hypothetic scenarios where you can transport your consciousness in laser beams to planets beyond our galaxy, and even escape the end of this universe.Many fascinating theories for space travel, building stations and ports in moons and asteroids, modifying our bodies to adapt to a non-planetary existence, and the different types of civilizations we might become, make this an eye/mind-opening read. Plus, it is a treasure chest of ideas for science fiction writers, who do not have the limitations of time or budget to make new realities come true on a page."
117,0241304849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73029907-cav,5,"This was an exceptionally well-formatted and written book. I really enjoyed it. This is my first from author Michio Kaku, but won't be my last.Kaku writes with a very engaging style, that holds the reader's attention effortlessly. This is a welcome change to many, many other science books I have read that are plagued by long-winded, esoteric and dry writing.The book is written in an easy-to-follow manner that would be suitable for the layperson who may be not too familiar with science. Kaku is an extremely effective science communicator; he takes complicated ideas, and conveys them in a simple and easy to understand manner. We need many more like him, IMHO.As mentioned, the book's formatting is excellent, as well. It is broken down into 3 main parts:
1) LEAVING THE EARTH2) VOYAGE TO THE STARS3) LIFE IN THE UNIVERSE
Which then break further down into different chapters. Kaku ends most chapters with a really natural segway to the upcoming one. The book has an excellent flow to it.If you were a fan of sci-fi as a kid, or are curious about what the future has in store for the human race, then this book is for you. The Future of Humanity covers (among many others): *The history of rockets; pioneers Goddard and von Braun.*Missions to the moon and Mars; the possibilities of living on either.*The asteroid belt, and possibilities of mining them.*The gas giants, Venus, Titan, and other moons.*Robotics, AI, and self-replicating robots.*Transhumanism*Spaceships; different theoretical technologies, and rocket types.*Black holes, wormholes, and spacetime.*The possibility of life on other worlds.*String theory and multiverses.I thoroughly enjoyed this book, and would most definitely recommend it to anyone interested in astronomy, physics, and the future of humanity in general. It is a big-picture book, with many incredible ideas that are sure to capture your imagination.5 stars, and a spot on my ""Favorites"" shelf."
118,0241304849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25338445-angie-reisetter,3,"Kaku is a great tour guide to the possibilities of the distant future. He imagines what may be possible, or at least what is not ruled out by the laws of physics as we know them. He has the tendency in this book, as he does in his others, to introduce topics with words like ""perhaps"" and ""might"", and then to drop them altogether, so that it sounds like he is telling us what will happen, casting aside minor difficulties like cost and human will. He threads science fiction references throughout his narrative, almost organizing his argument by what he's seen/read in science fiction. That's not a terrible way to go, but he also blurs the line of reality there, asking himself how we reconcile two different views of the future, as if they are not fictional and must be reconciled. The whole thing is very entertaining. But he has a theorist's tendency to discount reality, which is always my criticism of his work. But I did come back for more, and his work is always worth reading. A little inspiration is called for right about now.There seem to be a number of science futures becoming available in the near future, and I've recently read Soonish: Ten Emerging Technologies That'll Improve and/or Ruin Everything, which is very different from this one. I recommend them both as a study in contrasts: Kaku's extends to the limits of what might be possible one day maybe, and Soonish tries to keep it, well, soonish, in the realm of the reasonably possible. They have some topics in common, but they diverge rather dramatically.I got a copy to review from Net Galley."
119,0241304849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1667021-may-ling,5,"Summary: Well-Researched almost status update on where we are in creating the future a la sciene fiction.Short Vlog found at Instagram: WhereIsmayLing Youtube: Diary of a Speed Reader . I'd love it if you'd check me out and consider following/subscribing.You know, there is a crazy need that people have to judge a book by its title. It almost never is the case that that is what a book is on about. Perhaps a more accurate title would be: This is what Star Trek envisions and here's the status on where we're at. In that case, the book is amazing b/c it's quite hard to get that accomplished. If you look at the sea of references in the back and also read it, you'll realize how difficult it was to write something that is this comprehensive, albiet, much of detais of his reference are in the footnotes. p. 2 - He talks about the similarities between humans vs. chimps as a cohort a supposes that some cataclysmic event took out the genetic diversity that once was.p. 20 ""The amount of fuel you need reises exponentially with the change in velocity so that enormous amounts of fuel are needed to give an extra boost to speed."" (ok, a little wordy. What he's saying is it's hard to increasingly acceleration (that's what change in velocity is). You're going to need to accellorate for a while and at a crazy high speed if you want to leave earth for another planet. They are pretty far away.p. 32 - He deals with some of the politics and economics. He talks about it being easier to fund a person going into space vs program itself. As a result, many compromises (as that's more expensive to support life vs. just do unmanned missions).p. 33 - ""It takes $10k to put a pound of anything up in space.""p. 34 - The story of the great imperial fleet of Admiral Zheng 1405 - 1433. I really want to look thi up, b/c this was a big deal as relates to why there are Chinese people in specific places on the earth like Madagascar. Glad to finally get a citation. p. 40 Jules Verne's method of shooting someone to the moon predates rocket fuel. That's a major innovation. Blue Origin - company by Bezo's rocket system is called New ShepardElon Musk's Space X is called Falcon Rocket.p. 41Blue origin is billing it as a tourism voyage with an orientation.p. 43 Beso's vision: ""The whole idea is to perserve the Earth... The goal [is] to be able to evacuate humans. The planet would become a park."" All the waste would be ejected into space. In 2017 he announced his plans: ""Once considered a lonely outpost in space, the moon would become a bustling industrial and commercial hub with permanent manned bases and manufacturing."" p. 44 Moon Express plans on mining the moon.p. 45 The outer space treaty does not contain any language related to real estate ownership of the moon and it's annoying to many people to think of it.p. 47 - The book moves into the other tech that has to exist if you're legit going to go the moon. The first has to do with medical care. Robots need to get better for things like remote-controlled surgery. Similarly a lot more work has to go in withstanding radiation.p. 50 Talks about how the moon was formed through a huge impact billions of years ago. The Earth looked like packman and the Moon a slice. All that changed through gravity.p. 62 - Musk's company's vision to Mars...he's on track to try to send a manned mission to mars by 2024. Typically estimates have said it would cost betwen $400-500b. He's trying to do it for $10bln. He's trying to get the price down per ride to $200k so that it competes with Virgin's galactic SpaceShipTwo. There's also pricing for the Russian rocket International Space Station which is $20-40m. I never knew the price of this stuff. Nice.p. 67 The total failure (which is always fatal) of going into space is about 1.5% (3 failures out of 135) with the fatality count being about 3.3%. With mars, most satellites do not make it there (3/4ths do not).p. 85 - MDRS Mars Desert Research station attempts to make realistic situations to determine the psychological effects of being on MARS.p. 87 - Terraforming in terms of DNA. There is an idea that DNA came from Mars and transformed the earth. p. 93 - They believe that MARS lost its magnetic field (necessary to protect the planet) from heavy bombardment. It's why the core is solid vs. lava like ours.p. 94 - ""The Earth is larger than Mars, so it did not coll down as quickly. The Earth also did not suffer a collapse of its magnetic field caused by giant meteor impacts."" p. 99 - Some people want to break off a piece of Europa and bring it to mars to repopulate the planet with water.p. 103 - Titan has atmosphere and would actually support life, though we'd stll need a few other things. p. 116 - The use of AI to help explore the planets in preparation for human entrance. Or alternatively,we just move our organic body into a computer one so we can enjoy space travel.p. 118 - He introduces Neural Networks p. 121 - Self-replicating robots are necessary in space. this describes what they have to be like.p. 129 He has a theory that humans differ from animals b/c we notice time. I'm not 100% sure I agree. but ok.p. 156 HE talks about the challenge of stopping a rocket ship.p. 158 The space elevator is another option often tossed around.p. 169 Parallax. didn't know that word.p. 170 - Talks about how we find planets with minor dimming of light.p. 178 talks about rogue planets.p. 190 sets up for the idea that medical drives the ability of humans to expand into new territories.Solving aging (telemeers) is about allowing us to go to space.p. 204 Again putting you in a robot might work.p. 206 - They talk about the exoskeleton and where that's at.p. 211 - The chip in glasses to type out a sentence is early stage communication via just neural activity.p. 226- What if alliens are WAY ahead of us? p. 233 - It almost goes backward in talking about what makes Humans the best on earth. It's not b/c we are strong We are actually worthless in strengh and other characteristics.p. 248 A dyson sphere is created around a star to harness the energy that comes off of it.p. 258 They are looking for someone that has done this in the galaxy to see if some other species has left a big footprint like we have on earth. So far, no luck.p. 261 Talks about how DNA can demonstrate the rate of divergence/mutation. It's really slow. Weird would have thought it would be driven by the amount/speed of procreation. p. 323 A great reading list. I'd like to one day take a look at all of these books."
120,0241304849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/912138-alex-givant,5,Excellent book about what we need to do to leave Earth and spread between stars.
121,0241304849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/897-abe,4,"I enjoyed reading that book. While I don't agree with some of the author's views on the future of humanity, the book is very well written in an engaging style. I am now excited to dig more into string theory and super symmetry. "
122,0241304849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22443749-debbie,4,"4.5 starsThe Future of Humanity is a fascinating piece of speculative astrophysics and science which seeks to explore the various ways humanity may expand our civilization across the universe. I thoroughly enjoyed how in depth Kaku got, not just laying out the potential opportunities but also fully explaining the science behind the theories. Despite this heavily scientific approach, this book never felt boring or overwhelming. Even if some of the topics were a little far-fetched, it was nevertheless an intriguing and engaging read.—75,000 years ago there was a major volcanic eruption (Topa); considered the biggest eruption in the past 25 million years. Some scientists speculate only 2,000 humans remained and had to repopulate, which is why DNA between people even if they’re not related is surprisingly similarWhen you consider every single creature that has ever lived on the earth such as amoebas, plants, dinosaurs etc., you find that 99.9% have gone extinct, meaning the creatures and living things that are alive today are an extremely small sliver of all the living things that have ever lived on the planetOur earth has gone through 5 major extinction cycles in our history, in which up to 90% of the living species went extinct at a timeBecause our galaxy has 100 billion stars there may be as many as 20 billion Earth sized planets in the Milky Way galaxy. it’s estimated there is 2 billion trillion earth sized planets in the visible universe including galaxies outside our ownThere is actually gravity in space and the feeling/illusion of weightlessness is because everything falls at the same rate so astronauts are falling at the same rate as the spaceshipIn the future, we may use the moon as a gas station, because ice at the South Pole can be used to farm oxygen and hydrogen which are primary components of rocket fuel, and also rare earth metals found there as well which are also able to be made into fuel. Helium 3 is also expected to be on the moon, which can be used for Fusion reactors. There is also talk of finding platinum. All this raises the question of whether it’s legal to mine on the moon and if so who can stake a claim on itIf we built a living space on the moon, at first it would need to be sent supplies from Earth every few weeks. The astronauts could use Internet, cell phones etc. as normal once they set up the proper technology because the delay between earth and the moon is only one second. They could potentially farm oxygen from the soil and water from the ice caps. The bases may be built underground to protect from solar radiation. There will need to be large amounts of solar panels because a moon day lasts an Earth month, so there are 2 weeks of day followed by 2 weeks of nightYour blood boils in the vacuum of space because as pressure drops the boiling point of water also dropsAstroids contain iron, nickel, carbon & cobalt, as well as significant quantities of rare earth metals and valuable metals including irradium, platinum, and rodium. It is believed that we will eventually mine the astroid belt, and many entrepreneurs have already expressed interest in finding ways to do so. 12 astroids have already been identified as key targets for mining, because only a slight nudge to their orbit would bring them closer towards earth and the moon and able to enter into orbit, making mining them much more efficientElon musk‘s goal with space X is to reduce the cost of commercial space travel by 10x. He was the 1st to invent a reusable booster capsule module rather than discarding it after use. His ultimate goal is to make it to Mars. His goal is to send a manned mission to Mars by 2024. He envisions eventually the cost of sending someone to Mars will be $200,000/person round-tripIt only takes 3?days to get to the moon but 9 months to get to Mars. A round trip to Mars would take 2 years. Potential dangers during this deep space trip include excessive exposure to radiation, damage to the ship from solar flares or micro astroids, muscular atrophy from being in reduced gravity so long, and psychological side effectsNASA plans on having a manned mission arrive at Mars by 2033; this plan involves creating a lunar space station from which ships could go to Mars, rather than going directly to Mars like space XLike the moon, explorers on Mars would be able to harvest water, oxygen, and hydrogen from the permafrost and ice to serve as sources for water, oxygen, and fuel. The days on Mars are similar in length to days on earth, but the temperature is extremely cold, barely above the freezing point of water during the day and dropping drastically at night. Like the moon, the gravity is less so explorers would have to exercise daily to avoid muscular atrophy and loss of bone density. Mars has both water ice caps and dry ice/CO2 ice caps. The water ice caps stay consistent year round, but the dry ice caps fluctuate with the seasons and mostly evaporate in the summerFor Mars to become truly habitable, we would need to find a way to slowly heat the atmosphere so liquid water could flow on the surface, allowing for plants to grow outside of contained greenhouses. Terraforming mars is probably centuries away, and may be prohibitively costly. To artificially raise the temperature of the planet, we may inject water vapor and methane into the atmosphere to create a greenhouse effect, or send satellites into orbit over the ice caps to direct concentrated sunlight towards the caps to cause them to melt and release water vapor. Eventually, this warming process would become self-sustaining as well as increase the atmospheric pressure of mars. As plants grow and proliferate, dying plants will enrich the soil, and growing plants will add oxygen to the atmosphereMars cooled down slower than Earth did. Mars no longer has a molten core but rather a solid rock core, so it doesn’t have a magnetic field. This is one of the factors that accelerated Mars’s atmosphere loss. Also, the carbon dioxide is mostly trapped in the ground instead of proliferating in the atmosphere, causing a reverse greenhouse effectSome of the moons of the gas giants are also viewed as potential candidates for human coloniesThe gas giants are theorized to have a thick gaseous atmosphere, a cold liquid hydrogen ocean around the entire planet, and a small, solid hydrogen core because of the extreme pressures. Jupiter is surrounded by radiation, which causes Radio interference. The gravity of Jupiter actually helps protect the earth from being bombarded by astroids because it essentially serves as a vacuum cleanerTitan (a moon of Saturn) is a potential candidate for human colonization, but because it’s so far away it can’t have self-sustaining greenhouse effect, and the lakes of ethane Could combust if it got too hot. But it could be a source of fuel. And it’s one of the few places in our solar system where we would be able to go outside without a spacesuit because it has enough of an atmosphere that our blood wouldn’t boil/we wouldn’t be crushed (we’d still need an oxygen mask). Europa (a moon of Jupiter) has potential for microbial life in its ocean (which sits under the layer of ice that encircles the moon, and was made possible because of friction caused from the extreme tidal forces caused by Jupiter’s gravity)All the gas giants have rings, which are likely caused by moons that got too close to the planet being torn apart by the planet’s gravityTitan and the Kuiper belt would most likely serve as refueling stations or points from which to jump to the next star or planetGraphene/carbon nanotubes will likely be the material used to make infrastructure on other planets, because it’s immensely strong yet incredibly light. We’re not at a point yet where we can mass produce it, because even a small impurity can ruin it, but once we have the technology to do so, it’ll be the best material to use. It could even be used to create skin-tight, lightweight spacesuitsFor Interstellar and planetary colonization to be realistic, we would need automatons—robots with more intelligence than our current ones who can perform a wide variety of tasks such as building cities on planets and moons, which would be easier for a robot (doesn’t need a spacesuit, doesn’t get affected by radiation, isn’t limited by oxygen supply, etc)Getting robots to understand common sense has been extremely difficult and currently prevents them from fully perceiving and navigating the world. Currently robots need human intervention to do most tasks. Modern robots will likely be a combination of top down and bottom up learning; they will have some information already integrated into their systems but they will also have neural networks that will allow them to learn from repetition and gain common sense. Robots would also need to be self replicatingIon engines may make it possible for the trip to Mars to take 40 days rather than 9 monthsPotential energy sources for traveling at the speed of light include light sailing (propelling with lasers), nuclear energy (propelling with nuclear explosions), and antimatter energy. an antimatter rocket would have 100% energy efficiency, whereas nuclear explosion only has 1% because most of the Energy is wasted. However only a very small amount of anti-matter exists naturally, so we would have to manufacture it (currently extremely expensive). Storing the antimatter would be difficult because it would have to be stored in a trap that suspends it in a magnetic field so it’s not able to touch the edges of the container; if it touch the edges it would destroy the containerSomething that would help make getting materials into space much easier and more economical is creating a space elevator that stretches from the surface of the earth out above our atmosphere. Scientists predict that it is theoretically possible to do so, possibly even by 2035, but we would need to find a way to make enough strong enough Materials for this to be feasible. Ideally pure carbon nanotubes would be used, but right now it would be difficult to make as much as would be neededTo travel faster than light at warp speed, we need to find a way to make vast quantities of negative matter or negative energy. We’ve been able to make small amounts of negative energy, but we are nowhere close to producing the amount needed to even consider developing warp drivesSuspended animation/cryogenic freezing to allow longer voyages without needing generations of people to live on a spaceship is currently not possible. While other animals are able to survive in suspended animation because of the levels of glucose in their blood which prevents their blood from freezing, the amount of sugar needed is too high for humansTelomeres are part of our chromosomes that get shorter with aging; when they get too short the cells can no longer divide. If we can prevent that shortening from happening, it would increase our life span because our cells would be able to divide and replicate themselves longer. However, cancer operates in the same way and is essentially immortal, so that would be a riskIf we were able to identify exactly what parts of our genetic make up contribute to aging, we could alter our genes to expand our life expectancyAging is thought to be the accumulation of errors in our genetic make up over time, so if we can prevent those errors from happening because of deteriorating cell replication then we can slow down the aging processIf we were able to somehow make ourselves inmortal, or drastically increase our life expectancy, then we would likely have to deal with extreme overpopulation eventually. Before the Industrial Revolution, the human population of the earth was 300 million or less. It has now grown to 7.5 billion and is anticipated to increase by 1 billion every 12 years. It is estimated that there will be 11.2 billion people on the earth by 2100. However, others argued that our increase in population is slowly going down and will stabilize before we reach a level of overpopulationA primate has never been cloned. If we come to the point where human cloning is possible, it is likely that only a small percentage of the population would do so. It is also speculated that eventually we will find ways to modify our genes or enhance our bodies through cybernetics, but we will likely not take it so far that we drastically modify our appearance. Modifications would likely be improvements to existing issues (ex: eyesight) or ways to improve our social standing, rather than becoming creatures with giant heads and huge eyes and skinny bodies. Our use of cybernetics would prevent us from evolving that drastically. If we were to disperse in colonies across the galaxy, our genetic makeup would remain within 0.1% difference between colonies (same as between humans currently)We may in the next century or so develop ways to laser port our consciousness across the galaxy so our physical bodies could remain in place while our consciousness is able to move at the speed of light to visit other places by being ported it into an avatarEarth like planets need to be accompanied by large gaseous Jupiter like planets to clear out incoming astroids. They also need to be accompanied by a larger moon to stabilize their spin and trajectoryThe drake equation attempts to estimate the probability that we will make contact with intelligent life forms; however there is still a lot of unknowns that prevent us from having an accurate assessment from this equationIf there are intelligent beings on other planets, we can’t assume that they communicate vocally the same way we do. They might communicate through pheromones like bugs, or sonar like batsIntelligent life will likely follow the laws of evolution. An intelligent species will likely be descended from predators, so it will have forward facing eyes. They will also likely have opposable thumbs or some type of grasping appendage. They will also have some form of languageKardishev scale of civilizations: A type 1 civilization (planetary) uses all the energy of the sunlight that falls on the planet. Type 2 civilization (stellar) uses all the energy it’s sun produces. A type 3 civilization (galactic) uses the energy of an entire galaxy. We are currently a type 0.7 civilization because we’re not using the full energy of all the sunlight shining on our planet. We are about a century or two away from becoming a full type 1, and possibly A few thousand years from becoming a type 2. We might not become type 3 for 100,000 years or even up to 1 million because it requires a level of interstellar travel that we’re nowhere close to having. The energy measurements for each type just means and equivalent amount of energy, it doesn’t mean you have to be getting all your energy from the sun. Each next level of civilization is between 10 to 100 billion times more powerful than the previous typeA civilization that has reached type 2 is likely nearly immortal, and most of its energy generating machinery will likely be placed off planet because there will be so much energy being produced that it creates too much heat for the planet to be habitable. They will likely also harvest energy from their sun through a Dyson sphere and because of the vast quantities they are harvesting Will emit infrared radiationThere is another scale of civilization that is calculated based on the amount of information it consumes as proposed by Carl Sagan. Type A civilization consumes 1,000,000 bits of information. Type Z civilization consumes a 10^31 bits of information. We are a type H civilization. By this scale a type two civilization would be able to consume energy through widely distributed Dyson sphere, harvesting from astroids, developing super efficient nano technology, etc. and avoid giving up the levels of infrared radiation that would make it detectable to usOur first encounter with alien civilization will likely be a robotic self replicating probeString theory exists in 10 dimensions. It cancels out quantum corrections, basically meaning it cancels out the fact that quantum things like electrons and protons are able to be in multiple places at once. This quantum cancellation can only happen in 10 dimensions. The pairing for particles in string theory is sparticles, quarks are squarks, etc. String theory assumes an infinite number of universes (Multiverse). String theory says the universe was originally 10 dimensions, then for some reason the other 6 dimensions “curled up” leaving us with only 4 perceivable dimensionsDark matter was discovered because astrophysicist realized that the Milky Way was spinning 10 times faster than Newtonian physics would allow without flying apart, so they realize there must be some invisible thing adding all that extra mass to the galaxy. Dark matter is invisible, but it bends starlight so we’re able to detect it that way. Dark matter has gravity, but can’t be held/interact with matter in any way. It’s electrically neutral and only interacts with gravity. However we’ve never been able to officially prove that dark matter exist yet or create it ourselves in any way. Once we do, it will prove string theoryString theory is the only way would be able to do calculations about the quantum corrections needed for time travel, going through a wormhole, faster than light travel, etcThe universe is expected to eventually end in 1 of 3 ways: the big crunch, the big freeze, or the big rip. The big crunch is when the expansion of the universe slow down, stops, and reverses itself, eventually coalescing in a giant wad of superheated matter and possibly eventually turning into another big bang. For the big freeze, by the laws of entropy eventually the stars will stop shining, the sky will go black and temperature will reach absolute zero wherein matter nearly ceases to move. The big rip refers to the fact that the universe is exponentially expanding far faster than anticipated, and that distant galaxies will eventually speed away from us faster than the speed of light and disappear. Eventually our galaxy and solar system would be torn apart from this rapid expansion. The universe would end in an explosion, a singularity of infinite energyOur sun will exhaust its energy in about 5 billion years; it will expand into a red giant star which will essentially set the earth on fire, mountains will melt, oceans will boil, and the earth will be engulfed. After this, the sun will exhaust all its nuclear fuel and shrink and go cold as a white dwarf and then die as a dark dwarf star. In 4.8 billion years, the Milky Way and Andromeda galaxy’s will collide. There are two black holes will collide and merge and a new galaxy will eventually be formedDark energy is the energy of a vacuum. It acts like antigravity, and it pushes the universe apart. It is different than dark matter. The more the universe expands, the more dark energy there is, which makes the universe expand faster. About 69% of the matter/energy in the universe is contained in dark energy. Dark matter makes up 26%. Atoms of hydrogen and helium make up about 5%. And other higher elements that make up the earth, our bodies, etc. only make up 0.5%A possible way to overcome the eventual death of our universe is by becoming a type 4 civilization that harnesses extragalactic energy like dark energy and is able to reverse the big rip by creating a sphere in which dark energy reverses polarity so that inside the sphere The galaxies continue to survive normally while outside the sphere the universe is continuing to expand rapidly and tear itself apart. Another possible solution is that we find a way to leave our universe and go to one of the other theoretical bubble universes in the Multiverse. They could use negative energy to create a wormhole. The bubble universes are floating in a 10 dimensional arena—Read for the Astronomy prompt for the 2019 OWLs Readathon"

The second reason for listening twice is that it is chock full of info that is easy to miss in an audio format - so I also downloaded the Kindle version...I love Michio Kaku’s books. This one is about fun science of the future. Space travel - where are we, what do we still need to do, where would we go, how would we need to alter ourselves for outer space, what spacecrafts would we use, etc. Fun stuff, all told in an approachable, interesting story format. Kaku loves science fiction and peppers the narrative with movie and book references. Interestingly enough, he judges most of it more science and less fiction. Kaku is a physics professor, thus the physics are very solid; but I have my doubts on some of the biotechnology parts. Nevertheless, a thoroughly enjoyable book that I ended up listening to within about a day."
124,0241304849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8686546-feyzan---the-raven-boy,3,"3.5 starsthe journey of a thousand miles begins with the first stepI don't know what I was thinking when I picked this book up. I don't usually like to read books that are dense with physics and cosmology, but I admire michio kaku so i had to give this one a try. I am not surprised to feel disappointed, however. This book was pretty good on entertainment, and I understand why nerds would love it, but it did nothing for me, except maybe entertain a little. I couldn't take this book seriously as it was brimming with speculations about things that may or may not happen in next 5 billion years. I mean instead of worrying about what will happen in 5 billion years shouldn't we focus on saving our planet from all the man made chaos?I enjoyed the science fiction elements and reading about how tenaciously scientists are trying to make science fiction a new reality for humanity. It was all very interesting to read. The book covered many topics like terraforming, multi-verse, robotics, transhumanism. All these heavy and dense topic were easier to grasp and understand thanks to michio kaku's writing style and movie references. It feels like a new war is in order between the richest people of the world as they compete to colonize Mars and the universe itself. I think these rich people, Instead of spending billions of dollars on space exploration and planning to colonize other planets, should spend some of their foturne and influence to make this planet safe for everyone, Just saying. When I was a kid I used to dream about meeting aliens, going on a mission to space and whatnot. My imaginations used to very elaborated,  I used to imagine alines and robots in a very fanciful way. Robots used to have chips inside of them that could shut them off, if they tried to take over the world. Then I grew up. However, reading this book made me realize that some people are incapable of growing up.
 When self-aware robots do arrive, we must add a fail-safe chip that will shut them off if they have murderous thoughts.
I mean, first of all, no self aware robot is arriving anytime soon. Second of all, no self-aware robot will insert a chip inside of itself (I forgot to mention these robots are supposed to be self-replicating too.) Anyway, you get the idea this book is high on speculation and overflowing with head-scratching logic.
In 2017, a controversy arose between two billionaires, Mark Zuckerberg, founder of Facebook, and Elon Musk of SpaceX and Tesla. Zuckerberg maintained that artificial intelligence was a great generator of wealth and prosperity that will enrich all of society. Musk, however, took a much darker view and stated that AI actually posed an existential risk to all of humanity, that one day our creations may turn on us.
Wow, this exactly what we needed to be discussing right now. 🙄 Zuckerbergs' first concern should be to be make Facebook safe and secure again, not this. And then this book celebrate psychotic maniacs and call them heroes. 
 He confided to me that he takes several hundred pills a day, anticipating his own immortality
I guess, this book isn't meant to be taken seriously. It's just good to get inside the heads of scientists and learn how they operate and how they see the future. This book has imbued me with unnecessary knowledge that I don't know where and how to use. This knowledge is increasing my, already soaring, existential angst that wont rest until I use this knowledge somewhere. Anyway, this book isn't bad. It just wasn't for me. I am sure nerds and Sci-fi fans will love it."

Kaku addresses the possibilities of setting up permanent bases on the moon and terraforming Mars. At some point, humanity will need to move beyond the solar system to settle planets revolving around nearby stars. He also addresses genetic changes people may undergo, how humans will begin to merge with AI/machines, and ways immortality may become possible.

It really normalizes the thoughts of leaving Earth and not only exploring beyond, but settling beyond. Even crazier notions of removing our minds from our bodies to travel via laser beams to the exterior of our galaxy into exoskeletons waiting for us is explored. And logically. I recommend this book just for the sake of expanding your thoughts on outer space and the future of where humankind may end up."

Off course It was a pleasant experience because it get me acquainted with a world which I was unfamiliar with. Reading "" The future of humanity"", I thought about many serious subjects and my mind was blowing up with interesting informations about almost everything. From space to physics theories, everything was explained in simple words and that was the beauty of this book. Reading this book gives you a clear insight about the future of us as humans and discusses several probable possibilities in the long life span of humankind during his/her adventure in the space. I recommend those who are new to this genre, to read this work as their first experience, and I promise that it will be their best first experience!📚😊"
129,0241304849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7258380-dan-graser,4,"In his latest work, physicist Michio Kaku has focused on the what the future life of humanity might be as pertains to several possible scenarios. Throughout the work he mostly does a decent job of suggesting how plausible these ideas are, or at the very least, the type of timeframe needed to develop the requisite technological capabilities to achieve them. Beginning with the colonization of Mars, Kaku does a fine job of explaining just how this very popular notion would have to work, the costs involved, where our current capabilities stand, and just who is at the forefront of this quest. As NASA continues to be underfunded, though they do have a Mars program in operation, private funding has taken over much of this territory and the competition created by these developments is changing just how (some, particularly wealthy) humans may leave this planet for good.Next Kaku takes up the idea of interstellar travel. This is one area where the type of technology required is hundreds of years away. This distances to other star systems is staggering, our technology still primitive, and the pace at which we could develop any sort of device traveling remotely close to the speed of light is very difficult to predict. Some hugely interesting ideas are posited but he is quick to note that many of these are at the moment very unrealistic.The intersection of AI and humanity is discussed but not in particularly great detail. I would recommend Max Tegmark on this subject as his picture is a bit more complete. Anyone who has read the literature on this likely already has a more thorough understanding than is presented in this section.Finally and perhaps most significantly, Kaku details what physics tells us about the end of space and time and the possibility to forestall these dire (though billions of years in the future) events with technology developed to harness the gravitational effect of dark matter and dark energy. As we still have no idea as to the workings of either of these this is of course purely speculative but this is the first I've heard of these compelling ideas. As with all of his books, Kaku is an engaging and accessible writer that only occasionally veers into oversimplification or inclusion of ideas purely for their mass appeal, not for their plausibility. This is an effective summary of where we are as pertains to the possible routes humanity might take to ensure, at the level of our entire species, our survival. Wonderful reading all around."

Unlike pessimists like Harari who fear human life becoming meaningless by advances in AI, he imagines using progresses in technology to settle and terraform Mars and elsewhere ! The first section which focuses on near future technologies and space travel was an absolute delight.Also, his vision is not limited to the next decade or 20 years, he also talks about possibilities in the next 100 and 1000 years and even later. Except for the last chapters on wormholes and time-travel which felt weird, enjoyed this joyride. A bit like a spiritual guru the author was expanding my mind’s horizons with his thought-experiments.Will be reading more by this author."

"
133,0241304849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2433243-ayami,4,"Michio Kaku talks about a lot of interesting concepts regarding technology, space exploration and science. It wasn’t a mind-blowing read, though, as the majority of what he talks about has been mentioned in plenty of other non-fiction books out there. However, I won’t penalize the book for introducing themes I happened to be already familiar with. Some physics stuff I found hard to follow but this could be due to the fact, I was listening to it as an audiobook. Some reviewers complained about the onslaught of the pop culture references but I enjoyed them and think they were pretty well incorporated into the text. This could be because I have seen the majority of the movies mentioned, though. "

Topics range from propulsion systems to AI and biological enhancements. While a number of the author's ideas are not particularly convincing, virtually all are interesting."
140,0241304849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6991670-bob,4,"Summary: An exploration of the possibility and necessity of humanity becoming a multi-planetary species, and the revolutions of technology necessary to realize that future.Michio Kaku is a theoretical theorist studying string theory at the City University of New York, and the author of a series of best-selling futurist works based on his knowledge of physics and other fields. He is also a riveting, passionate speaker who believes, along with others like Elon Musk, that we must envision becoming a multi-planetary species. This, the latest of his books, explores that idea, it's necessity, and the technological advances that could make this possible.Kaku argument for the necessity of becoming a multi-planetary species is rooted in the priority of the survival of the human species. He is convinced that, whether through physical causes ranging from cataclysmic volcanoes to asteroids or the final death throes of the sun, our planet will become unlivable for human beings--if we do not accomplish this first through human causation as in nuclear holocaust or global warming. Discussing other great challenges we've faced through history, he writes:But now we face perhaps the greatest challenge of all: to leave the confines of the Earth and soar into outer space. The laws of physics are clear; sooner or later we will face global crises that threaten our very existence. (p.6)In three parts he explores the technologies that can make this possible. The first part explores interplanetary settlement efforts within our solar system, using moon as a base, and Mars as our first settlement, and later possibly settling, or exploiting the resources of the large moons orbiting the gas giants of Jupiter and Saturn. He describes existing efforts by public and private enterprise to return to the moon and create settlements on Mars. This itself is formidable considering exposures to radioactivity and the inhospitable nature of the planet but he argues for the eventual possibility of terra-forming Mars, making it livable and life sustaining. What is fascinating is that much of this is possible by applying and extending our current technology, albeit at great cost.The second part of the book seemed like something out of Star Trek, exploring the technologies of interstellar travel. All of this is beyond our current technologies. As a physicist, he takes us on a tour of possible technologies from nanoships and laser and solar sail propelled vehicles, to ramjet fusion and antimatter engines, and proposes that the warp drive of The Enterprise is possible, and consists not in propelling one faster than light, but literally warping space so that a vessel is pulled through it at hyper light speeds. Nearly all of this requires inordinately great quantities of energy, and presupposes a level of civilization at which we harness, first the energies of the sun, and than galactic levels of energy. This will allow us to explore at least the nearby stars or further into a galaxy of stars where it is increasingly evident that there are many possible habitable planets.The third part explores the reality that the great distances to be traveled, even should we exceed the speed of light, either require multi-generational crews, or advances toward immortality. He explores research on curing aging, on trans-humanism in which humans and machines become increasingly integrated. He discusses the Human Connectome Project, in which human neural networks are mapped, digitized, and potentially could be reproduced light years away, transmitted via laser networks. He also speculates on the existence of other more advanced civilizations. He mentions observations of recurring drops in energy output of star KIC 8462852 by as much as 30 percent positing an object 22 times as large as Jupiter, speculating that one possibility would be a megastructure like a Dyson sphere constructed by an alien civilization.This part also gets into Kaku's area of theoretical physics, string theory, as he explores the possibility of travel through wormholes and stargates and perhaps even escaping the present universe into one of many multiverses, particularly useful when this one burns out.Whew! Kaku's tour of the technologies necessary for interstellar travel is both breathtaking, and staggering. On one hand, much of the technology we use today, even that I am using as I write, was science fiction in my childhood. It is always dangerous to scoff at what seems impossible. The cell phone at my side represents applications of theoretical physics unknown 150 years ago in terms of the miniaturized circuitry and memory, cellular and wi-fi capabilities, GPS tracking, and touch screens. What would have been an object of wonder 150 years ago is now a commonplace of many of our lives. Yet what Kaku describes in this book, particularly in parts two and three, strings together ventures of immense cost, requiring unimaginable amounts of power, huge quantities of rare (and dangerous) resources like anti-matter, as well as scenarios, the survivability of which are in question, all of which to preserve the human species on a multi-planetary scale. Of course Kaku allows millenia for reaching such capabilities.The most credible part of the book for me was the near-term ideas of travel to Mars, perhaps even establishing some form of outpost there. If something of a cataclysmic nature were to occur on Earth in the next couple centuries, such an outpost might preserve civilization, and even re-settle earth. Even this is tremendously costly as well as risky. We must expect lives to be lost, even as they were among other explorers and settlers throughout our history. But it also raised questions of several sorts.Some were questions of priority. Should we think of terra-forming Mars when our own planet's earth, water and air need so much attention? Should we pour huge funds and inordinate amounts of energy into space travel when transport on earth is still carbon-based and polluting? When we are not yet addressing preventable diseases of childhood, and providing quality and affordable health care on a global basis, is it right to pour huge amounts into life-extending technologies that may benefit a select few? Or even as we think about planetary defense, might we focus on technologies for detection and destruction of planet-threatening objects from outer space? All this falls under the question of caring for the planet and people that we have before we think about settling other worlds.Some are more fundamental questions having to do with whether we ought to do these things. I think of this particularly around the discussion of immortality. Kaku fails to deal with the issue of whether it is a good thing for humans with our flawed as well as noble nature to live for ever. Have you ever noticed how, as people age, they become who they always were, to an even greater degree? We may grow both more loving and more neurotic. We may grow more knowledgeable and more petty. The closest he gets to this is when he quotes the late Stephen Hawking who said, ""We only have to look at ourselves to see how intelligent life might develop into something we wouldn't want to meet."" In my own faith tradition, we believe that it is a severe mercy of God that flawed and fallen people don't live endlessly in our bodies and that hope is found not in endless mortal life, but life everlasting beyond bodily death.Finally, I am troubled with the hubristic strains that carry as much attraction for many contemporary hearers as they did for the first couple in the garden, and the tower builders of Babel. Kaku writes:...our destiny is to become the gods we once feared and worshipped. Science will give us the means by which we can shape the universe in our image. The question is whether we will have the wisdom of Solomon to accompany this vast celestial power. (p. 14)""You shall be as gods"" has been a temptation from the very beginning, and is one this book proffers to its readers. Along with that temptation comes tower-building (or space elevator) projects that reflect our pitiful efforts to offset our creaturely vulnerabilities. Will we exchange dependence on the sustenance of the Creator and responsible care for the world we've been given for anxious and costly efforts to preserve ourselves in other worlds, and perhaps neglect the most vulnerable on our own planet? I find the reference to Solomon fascinating, because the record tells us that, while wise, he abandoned the fear of God which is the beginning of wisdom, giving himself to building projects that taxed and enslaved, and that he multiplied wives and experiences. If Ecclesiastes gives us the final verdict on this project, it is all summed up as ""meaningless,"" ""a chasing after the wind,"" and that ""with much wisdom comes much sorrow."" It seems that this is what always comes of trying to make ourselves gods, and trying to stave off death when a universe of wonder and a world of beauty to be cared for beckons us to trust its Maker."

Not to mention some truly stupid claims in here, such as his belief that only human beings (as opposed to other animals) possess an awareness of time. That's incorrect by inspection.And worse - it's boring. It feels less like ""The Future of Humanity"" and more like ""Cliffnotes of the Future of Humanity."" You would be vastly better served reading a science fiction book that explores these ideas of interstellar travel, generation arks, AI, etc. The Martian; The Expanse; etc, etc.BUT one major positive is just how much research this book inspired me into. It has a lot of references to real and underway projects. Following up on these was both fun and informative."

This book is the second book from Kaku that I've read, and even though I liked his ""Parallel Worlds"" more, this one is also a pretty decent book.

So some of the facts contained goes up to things happening in 2017, which is nice.The latter part of the book touching on quantum and string theory, starts going over one's head a bit. Although explained as simple as possible, it does become a bit difficult to follow in audio format. You also need to be really open minded to get your head around some of the concepts / possibilities presented for the future.

Plus, it is a treasure chest of ideas for science fiction writers, who do not have the limitations of time or budget to make new realities come true on a page."
147,0241304849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73029907-cav,5,"This was an exceptionally well-formatted and written book. I really enjoyed it. This is my first from author Michio Kaku, but won't be my last.Kaku writes with a very engaging style, that holds the reader's attention effortlessly. This is a welcome change to many, many other science books I have read that are plagued by long-winded, esoteric and dry writing.The book is written in an easy-to-follow manner that would be suitable for the layperson who may be not too familiar with science. Kaku is an extremely effective science communicator; he takes complicated ideas, and conveys them in a simple and easy to understand manner. We need many more like him, IMHO.As mentioned, the book's formatting is excellent, as well. It is broken down into 3 main parts:
1) LEAVING THE EARTH2) VOYAGE TO THE STARS3) LIFE IN THE UNIVERSE
Which then break further down into different chapters. Kaku ends most chapters with a really natural segway to the upcoming one. The book has an excellent flow to it.If you were a fan of sci-fi as a kid, or are curious about what the future has in store for the human race, then this book is for you. The Future of Humanity covers (among many others): *The history of rockets; pioneers Goddard and von Braun.*Missions to the moon and Mars; the possibilities of living on either.*The asteroid belt, and possibilities of mining them.*The gas giants, Venus, Titan, and other moons.*Robotics, AI, and self-replicating robots.*Transhumanism*Spaceships; different theoretical technologies, and rocket types.*Black holes, wormholes, and spacetime.*The possibility of life on other worlds.*String theory and multiverses.I thoroughly enjoyed this book, and would most definitely recommend it to anyone interested in astronomy, physics, and the future of humanity in general. It is a big-picture book, with many incredible ideas that are sure to capture your imagination.5 stars, and a spot on my ""Favorites"" shelf."
148,0241304849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25338445-angie-reisetter,3,"Kaku is a great tour guide to the possibilities of the distant future. He imagines what may be possible, or at least what is not ruled out by the laws of physics as we know them. He has the tendency in this book, as he does in his others, to introduce topics with words like ""perhaps"" and ""might"", and then to drop them altogether, so that it sounds like he is telling us what will happen, casting aside minor difficulties like cost and human will. He threads science fiction references throughout his narrative, almost organizing his argument by what he's seen/read in science fiction. That's not a terrible way to go, but he also blurs the line of reality there, asking himself how we reconcile two different views of the future, as if they are not fictional and must be reconciled. The whole thing is very entertaining. But he has a theorist's tendency to discount reality, which is always my criticism of his work. But I did come back for more, and his work is always worth reading. A little inspiration is called for right about now.There seem to be a number of science futures becoming available in the near future, and I've recently read Soonish: Ten Emerging Technologies That'll Improve and/or Ruin Everything, which is very different from this one. I recommend them both as a study in contrasts: Kaku's extends to the limits of what might be possible one day maybe, and Soonish tries to keep it, well, soonish, in the realm of the reasonably possible. They have some topics in common, but they diverge rather dramatically.I got a copy to review from Net Galley."
149,0241304849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1667021-may-ling,5,"Summary: Well-Researched almost status update on where we are in creating the future a la sciene fiction.Short Vlog found at Instagram: WhereIsmayLing Youtube: Diary of a Speed Reader . I'd love it if you'd check me out and consider following/subscribing.You know, there is a crazy need that people have to judge a book by its title. It almost never is the case that that is what a book is on about. Perhaps a more accurate title would be: This is what Star Trek envisions and here's the status on where we're at. In that case, the book is amazing b/c it's quite hard to get that accomplished. If you look at the sea of references in the back and also read it, you'll realize how difficult it was to write something that is this comprehensive, albiet, much of detais of his reference are in the footnotes. p. 2 - He talks about the similarities between humans vs. chimps as a cohort a supposes that some cataclysmic event took out the genetic diversity that once was.p. 20 ""The amount of fuel you need reises exponentially with the change in velocity so that enormous amounts of fuel are needed to give an extra boost to speed."" (ok, a little wordy. What he's saying is it's hard to increasingly acceleration (that's what change in velocity is). You're going to need to accellorate for a while and at a crazy high speed if you want to leave earth for another planet. They are pretty far away.p. 32 - He deals with some of the politics and economics. He talks about it being easier to fund a person going into space vs program itself. As a result, many compromises (as that's more expensive to support life vs. just do unmanned missions).p. 33 - ""It takes $10k to put a pound of anything up in space.""p. 34 - The story of the great imperial fleet of Admiral Zheng 1405 - 1433. I really want to look thi up, b/c this was a big deal as relates to why there are Chinese people in specific places on the earth like Madagascar. Glad to finally get a citation. p. 40 Jules Verne's method of shooting someone to the moon predates rocket fuel. That's a major innovation. Blue Origin - company by Bezo's rocket system is called New ShepardElon Musk's Space X is called Falcon Rocket.p. 41Blue origin is billing it as a tourism voyage with an orientation.p. 43 Beso's vision: ""The whole idea is to perserve the Earth... The goal [is] to be able to evacuate humans. The planet would become a park."" All the waste would be ejected into space. In 2017 he announced his plans: ""Once considered a lonely outpost in space, the moon would become a bustling industrial and commercial hub with permanent manned bases and manufacturing."" p. 44 Moon Express plans on mining the moon.p. 45 The outer space treaty does not contain any language related to real estate ownership of the moon and it's annoying to many people to think of it.p. 47 - The book moves into the other tech that has to exist if you're legit going to go the moon. The first has to do with medical care. Robots need to get better for things like remote-controlled surgery. Similarly a lot more work has to go in withstanding radiation.p. 50 Talks about how the moon was formed through a huge impact billions of years ago. The Earth looked like packman and the Moon a slice. All that changed through gravity.p. 62 - Musk's company's vision to Mars...he's on track to try to send a manned mission to mars by 2024. Typically estimates have said it would cost betwen $400-500b. He's trying to do it for $10bln. He's trying to get the price down per ride to $200k so that it competes with Virgin's galactic SpaceShipTwo. There's also pricing for the Russian rocket International Space Station which is $20-40m. I never knew the price of this stuff. Nice.p. 67 The total failure (which is always fatal) of going into space is about 1.5% (3 failures out of 135) with the fatality count being about 3.3%. With mars, most satellites do not make it there (3/4ths do not).p. 85 - MDRS Mars Desert Research station attempts to make realistic situations to determine the psychological effects of being on MARS.p. 87 - Terraforming in terms of DNA. There is an idea that DNA came from Mars and transformed the earth. p. 93 - They believe that MARS lost its magnetic field (necessary to protect the planet) from heavy bombardment. It's why the core is solid vs. lava like ours.p. 94 - ""The Earth is larger than Mars, so it did not coll down as quickly. The Earth also did not suffer a collapse of its magnetic field caused by giant meteor impacts."" p. 99 - Some people want to break off a piece of Europa and bring it to mars to repopulate the planet with water.p. 103 - Titan has atmosphere and would actually support life, though we'd stll need a few other things. p. 116 - The use of AI to help explore the planets in preparation for human entrance. Or alternatively,we just move our organic body into a computer one so we can enjoy space travel.p. 118 - He introduces Neural Networks p. 121 - Self-replicating robots are necessary in space. this describes what they have to be like.p. 129 He has a theory that humans differ from animals b/c we notice time. I'm not 100% sure I agree. but ok.p. 156 HE talks about the challenge of stopping a rocket ship.p. 158 The space elevator is another option often tossed around.p. 169 Parallax. didn't know that word.p. 170 - Talks about how we find planets with minor dimming of light.p. 178 talks about rogue planets.p. 190 sets up for the idea that medical drives the ability of humans to expand into new territories.Solving aging (telemeers) is about allowing us to go to space.p. 204 Again putting you in a robot might work.p. 206 - They talk about the exoskeleton and where that's at.p. 211 - The chip in glasses to type out a sentence is early stage communication via just neural activity.p. 226- What if alliens are WAY ahead of us? p. 233 - It almost goes backward in talking about what makes Humans the best on earth. It's not b/c we are strong We are actually worthless in strengh and other characteristics.p. 248 A dyson sphere is created around a star to harness the energy that comes off of it.p. 258 They are looking for someone that has done this in the galaxy to see if some other species has left a big footprint like we have on earth. So far, no luck.p. 261 Talks about how DNA can demonstrate the rate of divergence/mutation. It's really slow. Weird would have thought it would be driven by the amount/speed of procreation. p. 323 A great reading list. I'd like to one day take a look at all of these books."
150,0241304849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/912138-alex-givant,5,Excellent book about what we need to do to leave Earth and spread between stars.
151,0241304849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/897-abe,4,"I enjoyed reading that book. While I don't agree with some of the author's views on the future of humanity, the book is very well written in an engaging style. I am now excited to dig more into string theory and super symmetry. "
152,0241304849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22443749-debbie,4,"4.5 starsThe Future of Humanity is a fascinating piece of speculative astrophysics and science which seeks to explore the various ways humanity may expand our civilization across the universe. I thoroughly enjoyed how in depth Kaku got, not just laying out the potential opportunities but also fully explaining the science behind the theories. Despite this heavily scientific approach, this book never felt boring or overwhelming. Even if some of the topics were a little far-fetched, it was nevertheless an intriguing and engaging read.—75,000 years ago there was a major volcanic eruption (Topa); considered the biggest eruption in the past 25 million years. Some scientists speculate only 2,000 humans remained and had to repopulate, which is why DNA between people even if they’re not related is surprisingly similarWhen you consider every single creature that has ever lived on the earth such as amoebas, plants, dinosaurs etc., you find that 99.9% have gone extinct, meaning the creatures and living things that are alive today are an extremely small sliver of all the living things that have ever lived on the planetOur earth has gone through 5 major extinction cycles in our history, in which up to 90% of the living species went extinct at a timeBecause our galaxy has 100 billion stars there may be as many as 20 billion Earth sized planets in the Milky Way galaxy. it’s estimated there is 2 billion trillion earth sized planets in the visible universe including galaxies outside our ownThere is actually gravity in space and the feeling/illusion of weightlessness is because everything falls at the same rate so astronauts are falling at the same rate as the spaceshipIn the future, we may use the moon as a gas station, because ice at the South Pole can be used to farm oxygen and hydrogen which are primary components of rocket fuel, and also rare earth metals found there as well which are also able to be made into fuel. Helium 3 is also expected to be on the moon, which can be used for Fusion reactors. There is also talk of finding platinum. All this raises the question of whether it’s legal to mine on the moon and if so who can stake a claim on itIf we built a living space on the moon, at first it would need to be sent supplies from Earth every few weeks. The astronauts could use Internet, cell phones etc. as normal once they set up the proper technology because the delay between earth and the moon is only one second. They could potentially farm oxygen from the soil and water from the ice caps. The bases may be built underground to protect from solar radiation. There will need to be large amounts of solar panels because a moon day lasts an Earth month, so there are 2 weeks of day followed by 2 weeks of nightYour blood boils in the vacuum of space because as pressure drops the boiling point of water also dropsAstroids contain iron, nickel, carbon & cobalt, as well as significant quantities of rare earth metals and valuable metals including irradium, platinum, and rodium. It is believed that we will eventually mine the astroid belt, and many entrepreneurs have already expressed interest in finding ways to do so. 12 astroids have already been identified as key targets for mining, because only a slight nudge to their orbit would bring them closer towards earth and the moon and able to enter into orbit, making mining them much more efficientElon musk‘s goal with space X is to reduce the cost of commercial space travel by 10x. He was the 1st to invent a reusable booster capsule module rather than discarding it after use. His ultimate goal is to make it to Mars. His goal is to send a manned mission to Mars by 2024. He envisions eventually the cost of sending someone to Mars will be $200,000/person round-tripIt only takes 3?days to get to the moon but 9 months to get to Mars. A round trip to Mars would take 2 years. Potential dangers during this deep space trip include excessive exposure to radiation, damage to the ship from solar flares or micro astroids, muscular atrophy from being in reduced gravity so long, and psychological side effectsNASA plans on having a manned mission arrive at Mars by 2033; this plan involves creating a lunar space station from which ships could go to Mars, rather than going directly to Mars like space XLike the moon, explorers on Mars would be able to harvest water, oxygen, and hydrogen from the permafrost and ice to serve as sources for water, oxygen, and fuel. The days on Mars are similar in length to days on earth, but the temperature is extremely cold, barely above the freezing point of water during the day and dropping drastically at night. Like the moon, the gravity is less so explorers would have to exercise daily to avoid muscular atrophy and loss of bone density. Mars has both water ice caps and dry ice/CO2 ice caps. The water ice caps stay consistent year round, but the dry ice caps fluctuate with the seasons and mostly evaporate in the summerFor Mars to become truly habitable, we would need to find a way to slowly heat the atmosphere so liquid water could flow on the surface, allowing for plants to grow outside of contained greenhouses. Terraforming mars is probably centuries away, and may be prohibitively costly. To artificially raise the temperature of the planet, we may inject water vapor and methane into the atmosphere to create a greenhouse effect, or send satellites into orbit over the ice caps to direct concentrated sunlight towards the caps to cause them to melt and release water vapor. Eventually, this warming process would become self-sustaining as well as increase the atmospheric pressure of mars. As plants grow and proliferate, dying plants will enrich the soil, and growing plants will add oxygen to the atmosphereMars cooled down slower than Earth did. Mars no longer has a molten core but rather a solid rock core, so it doesn’t have a magnetic field. This is one of the factors that accelerated Mars’s atmosphere loss. Also, the carbon dioxide is mostly trapped in the ground instead of proliferating in the atmosphere, causing a reverse greenhouse effectSome of the moons of the gas giants are also viewed as potential candidates for human coloniesThe gas giants are theorized to have a thick gaseous atmosphere, a cold liquid hydrogen ocean around the entire planet, and a small, solid hydrogen core because of the extreme pressures. Jupiter is surrounded by radiation, which causes Radio interference. The gravity of Jupiter actually helps protect the earth from being bombarded by astroids because it essentially serves as a vacuum cleanerTitan (a moon of Saturn) is a potential candidate for human colonization, but because it’s so far away it can’t have self-sustaining greenhouse effect, and the lakes of ethane Could combust if it got too hot. But it could be a source of fuel. And it’s one of the few places in our solar system where we would be able to go outside without a spacesuit because it has enough of an atmosphere that our blood wouldn’t boil/we wouldn’t be crushed (we’d still need an oxygen mask). Europa (a moon of Jupiter) has potential for microbial life in its ocean (which sits under the layer of ice that encircles the moon, and was made possible because of friction caused from the extreme tidal forces caused by Jupiter’s gravity)All the gas giants have rings, which are likely caused by moons that got too close to the planet being torn apart by the planet’s gravityTitan and the Kuiper belt would most likely serve as refueling stations or points from which to jump to the next star or planetGraphene/carbon nanotubes will likely be the material used to make infrastructure on other planets, because it’s immensely strong yet incredibly light. We’re not at a point yet where we can mass produce it, because even a small impurity can ruin it, but once we have the technology to do so, it’ll be the best material to use. It could even be used to create skin-tight, lightweight spacesuitsFor Interstellar and planetary colonization to be realistic, we would need automatons—robots with more intelligence than our current ones who can perform a wide variety of tasks such as building cities on planets and moons, which would be easier for a robot (doesn’t need a spacesuit, doesn’t get affected by radiation, isn’t limited by oxygen supply, etc)Getting robots to understand common sense has been extremely difficult and currently prevents them from fully perceiving and navigating the world. Currently robots need human intervention to do most tasks. Modern robots will likely be a combination of top down and bottom up learning; they will have some information already integrated into their systems but they will also have neural networks that will allow them to learn from repetition and gain common sense. Robots would also need to be self replicatingIon engines may make it possible for the trip to Mars to take 40 days rather than 9 monthsPotential energy sources for traveling at the speed of light include light sailing (propelling with lasers), nuclear energy (propelling with nuclear explosions), and antimatter energy. an antimatter rocket would have 100% energy efficiency, whereas nuclear explosion only has 1% because most of the Energy is wasted. However only a very small amount of anti-matter exists naturally, so we would have to manufacture it (currently extremely expensive). Storing the antimatter would be difficult because it would have to be stored in a trap that suspends it in a magnetic field so it’s not able to touch the edges of the container; if it touch the edges it would destroy the containerSomething that would help make getting materials into space much easier and more economical is creating a space elevator that stretches from the surface of the earth out above our atmosphere. Scientists predict that it is theoretically possible to do so, possibly even by 2035, but we would need to find a way to make enough strong enough Materials for this to be feasible. Ideally pure carbon nanotubes would be used, but right now it would be difficult to make as much as would be neededTo travel faster than light at warp speed, we need to find a way to make vast quantities of negative matter or negative energy. We’ve been able to make small amounts of negative energy, but we are nowhere close to producing the amount needed to even consider developing warp drivesSuspended animation/cryogenic freezing to allow longer voyages without needing generations of people to live on a spaceship is currently not possible. While other animals are able to survive in suspended animation because of the levels of glucose in their blood which prevents their blood from freezing, the amount of sugar needed is too high for humansTelomeres are part of our chromosomes that get shorter with aging; when they get too short the cells can no longer divide. If we can prevent that shortening from happening, it would increase our life span because our cells would be able to divide and replicate themselves longer. However, cancer operates in the same way and is essentially immortal, so that would be a riskIf we were able to identify exactly what parts of our genetic make up contribute to aging, we could alter our genes to expand our life expectancyAging is thought to be the accumulation of errors in our genetic make up over time, so if we can prevent those errors from happening because of deteriorating cell replication then we can slow down the aging processIf we were able to somehow make ourselves inmortal, or drastically increase our life expectancy, then we would likely have to deal with extreme overpopulation eventually. Before the Industrial Revolution, the human population of the earth was 300 million or less. It has now grown to 7.5 billion and is anticipated to increase by 1 billion every 12 years. It is estimated that there will be 11.2 billion people on the earth by 2100. However, others argued that our increase in population is slowly going down and will stabilize before we reach a level of overpopulationA primate has never been cloned. If we come to the point where human cloning is possible, it is likely that only a small percentage of the population would do so. It is also speculated that eventually we will find ways to modify our genes or enhance our bodies through cybernetics, but we will likely not take it so far that we drastically modify our appearance. Modifications would likely be improvements to existing issues (ex: eyesight) or ways to improve our social standing, rather than becoming creatures with giant heads and huge eyes and skinny bodies. Our use of cybernetics would prevent us from evolving that drastically. If we were to disperse in colonies across the galaxy, our genetic makeup would remain within 0.1% difference between colonies (same as between humans currently)We may in the next century or so develop ways to laser port our consciousness across the galaxy so our physical bodies could remain in place while our consciousness is able to move at the speed of light to visit other places by being ported it into an avatarEarth like planets need to be accompanied by large gaseous Jupiter like planets to clear out incoming astroids. They also need to be accompanied by a larger moon to stabilize their spin and trajectoryThe drake equation attempts to estimate the probability that we will make contact with intelligent life forms; however there is still a lot of unknowns that prevent us from having an accurate assessment from this equationIf there are intelligent beings on other planets, we can’t assume that they communicate vocally the same way we do. They might communicate through pheromones like bugs, or sonar like batsIntelligent life will likely follow the laws of evolution. An intelligent species will likely be descended from predators, so it will have forward facing eyes. They will also likely have opposable thumbs or some type of grasping appendage. They will also have some form of languageKardishev scale of civilizations: A type 1 civilization (planetary) uses all the energy of the sunlight that falls on the planet. Type 2 civilization (stellar) uses all the energy it’s sun produces. A type 3 civilization (galactic) uses the energy of an entire galaxy. We are currently a type 0.7 civilization because we’re not using the full energy of all the sunlight shining on our planet. We are about a century or two away from becoming a full type 1, and possibly A few thousand years from becoming a type 2. We might not become type 3 for 100,000 years or even up to 1 million because it requires a level of interstellar travel that we’re nowhere close to having. The energy measurements for each type just means and equivalent amount of energy, it doesn’t mean you have to be getting all your energy from the sun. Each next level of civilization is between 10 to 100 billion times more powerful than the previous typeA civilization that has reached type 2 is likely nearly immortal, and most of its energy generating machinery will likely be placed off planet because there will be so much energy being produced that it creates too much heat for the planet to be habitable. They will likely also harvest energy from their sun through a Dyson sphere and because of the vast quantities they are harvesting Will emit infrared radiationThere is another scale of civilization that is calculated based on the amount of information it consumes as proposed by Carl Sagan. Type A civilization consumes 1,000,000 bits of information. Type Z civilization consumes a 10^31 bits of information. We are a type H civilization. By this scale a type two civilization would be able to consume energy through widely distributed Dyson sphere, harvesting from astroids, developing super efficient nano technology, etc. and avoid giving up the levels of infrared radiation that would make it detectable to usOur first encounter with alien civilization will likely be a robotic self replicating probeString theory exists in 10 dimensions. It cancels out quantum corrections, basically meaning it cancels out the fact that quantum things like electrons and protons are able to be in multiple places at once. This quantum cancellation can only happen in 10 dimensions. The pairing for particles in string theory is sparticles, quarks are squarks, etc. String theory assumes an infinite number of universes (Multiverse). String theory says the universe was originally 10 dimensions, then for some reason the other 6 dimensions “curled up” leaving us with only 4 perceivable dimensionsDark matter was discovered because astrophysicist realized that the Milky Way was spinning 10 times faster than Newtonian physics would allow without flying apart, so they realize there must be some invisible thing adding all that extra mass to the galaxy. Dark matter is invisible, but it bends starlight so we’re able to detect it that way. Dark matter has gravity, but can’t be held/interact with matter in any way. It’s electrically neutral and only interacts with gravity. However we’ve never been able to officially prove that dark matter exist yet or create it ourselves in any way. Once we do, it will prove string theoryString theory is the only way would be able to do calculations about the quantum corrections needed for time travel, going through a wormhole, faster than light travel, etcThe universe is expected to eventually end in 1 of 3 ways: the big crunch, the big freeze, or the big rip. The big crunch is when the expansion of the universe slow down, stops, and reverses itself, eventually coalescing in a giant wad of superheated matter and possibly eventually turning into another big bang. For the big freeze, by the laws of entropy eventually the stars will stop shining, the sky will go black and temperature will reach absolute zero wherein matter nearly ceases to move. The big rip refers to the fact that the universe is exponentially expanding far faster than anticipated, and that distant galaxies will eventually speed away from us faster than the speed of light and disappear. Eventually our galaxy and solar system would be torn apart from this rapid expansion. The universe would end in an explosion, a singularity of infinite energyOur sun will exhaust its energy in about 5 billion years; it will expand into a red giant star which will essentially set the earth on fire, mountains will melt, oceans will boil, and the earth will be engulfed. After this, the sun will exhaust all its nuclear fuel and shrink and go cold as a white dwarf and then die as a dark dwarf star. In 4.8 billion years, the Milky Way and Andromeda galaxy’s will collide. There are two black holes will collide and merge and a new galaxy will eventually be formedDark energy is the energy of a vacuum. It acts like antigravity, and it pushes the universe apart. It is different than dark matter. The more the universe expands, the more dark energy there is, which makes the universe expand faster. About 69% of the matter/energy in the universe is contained in dark energy. Dark matter makes up 26%. Atoms of hydrogen and helium make up about 5%. And other higher elements that make up the earth, our bodies, etc. only make up 0.5%A possible way to overcome the eventual death of our universe is by becoming a type 4 civilization that harnesses extragalactic energy like dark energy and is able to reverse the big rip by creating a sphere in which dark energy reverses polarity so that inside the sphere The galaxies continue to survive normally while outside the sphere the universe is continuing to expand rapidly and tear itself apart. Another possible solution is that we find a way to leave our universe and go to one of the other theoretical bubble universes in the Multiverse. They could use negative energy to create a wormhole. The bubble universes are floating in a 10 dimensional arena—Read for the Astronomy prompt for the 2019 OWLs Readathon"
153,0241304849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2168708-marta,5,"I loved this so much that I listened to it twice. The second reason for listening twice is that it is chock full of info that is easy to miss in an audio format - so I also downloaded the Kindle version...I love Michio Kaku’s books. This one is about fun science of the future. Space travel - where are we, what do we still need to do, where would we go, how would we need to alter ourselves for outer space, what spacecrafts would we use, etc. Fun stuff, all told in an approachable, interesting story format. Kaku loves science fiction and peppers the narrative with movie and book references. Interestingly enough, he judges most of it more science and less fiction. Kaku is a physics professor, thus the physics are very solid; but I have my doubts on some of the biotechnology parts. Nevertheless, a thoroughly enjoyable book that I ended up listening to within about a day."
154,0241304849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8686546-feyzan---the-raven-boy,3,"3.5 starsthe journey of a thousand miles begins with the first stepI don't know what I was thinking when I picked this book up. I don't usually like to read books that are dense with physics and cosmology, but I admire michio kaku so i had to give this one a try. I am not surprised to feel disappointed, however. This book was pretty good on entertainment, and I understand why nerds would love it, but it did nothing for me, except maybe entertain a little. I couldn't take this book seriously as it was brimming with speculations about things that may or may not happen in next 5 billion years. I mean instead of worrying about what will happen in 5 billion years shouldn't we focus on saving our planet from all the man made chaos?I enjoyed the science fiction elements and reading about how tenaciously scientists are trying to make science fiction a new reality for humanity. It was all very interesting to read. The book covered many topics like terraforming, multi-verse, robotics, transhumanism. All these heavy and dense topic were easier to grasp and understand thanks to michio kaku's writing style and movie references. It feels like a new war is in order between the richest people of the world as they compete to colonize Mars and the universe itself. I think these rich people, Instead of spending billions of dollars on space exploration and planning to colonize other planets, should spend some of their foturne and influence to make this planet safe for everyone, Just saying. When I was a kid I used to dream about meeting aliens, going on a mission to space and whatnot. My imaginations used to very elaborated,  I used to imagine alines and robots in a very fanciful way. Robots used to have chips inside of them that could shut them off, if they tried to take over the world. Then I grew up. However, reading this book made me realize that some people are incapable of growing up.
 When self-aware robots do arrive, we must add a fail-safe chip that will shut them off if they have murderous thoughts.
I mean, first of all, no self aware robot is arriving anytime soon. Second of all, no self-aware robot will insert a chip inside of itself (I forgot to mention these robots are supposed to be self-replicating too.) Anyway, you get the idea this book is high on speculation and overflowing with head-scratching logic.
In 2017, a controversy arose between two billionaires, Mark Zuckerberg, founder of Facebook, and Elon Musk of SpaceX and Tesla. Zuckerberg maintained that artificial intelligence was a great generator of wealth and prosperity that will enrich all of society. Musk, however, took a much darker view and stated that AI actually posed an existential risk to all of humanity, that one day our creations may turn on us.
Wow, this exactly what we needed to be discussing right now. 🙄 Zuckerbergs' first concern should be to be make Facebook safe and secure again, not this. And then this book celebrate psychotic maniacs and call them heroes. 
 He confided to me that he takes several hundred pills a day, anticipating his own immortality
I guess, this book isn't meant to be taken seriously. It's just good to get inside the heads of scientists and learn how they operate and how they see the future. This book has imbued me with unnecessary knowledge that I don't know where and how to use. This knowledge is increasing my, already soaring, existential angst that wont rest until I use this knowledge somewhere. Anyway, this book isn't bad. It just wasn't for me. I am sure nerds and Sci-fi fans will love it."
155,0241304849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/77527711-j-c-ahmed,5,"The Future of Humanity, as the title suggests, makes predictions about humanity's future. Kaku addresses the possibilities of setting up permanent bases on the moon and terraforming Mars. At some point, humanity will need to move beyond the solar system to settle planets revolving around nearby stars. He also addresses genetic changes people may undergo, how humans will begin to merge with AI/machines, and ways immortality may become possible. It's fascinating stuff that should please both science and sci-fi fans."
156,0241304849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48491730-diego,5,"This was such an interesting book. It really normalizes the thoughts of leaving Earth and not only exploring beyond, but settling beyond. Even crazier notions of removing our minds from our bodies to travel via laser beams to the exterior of our galaxy into exoskeletons waiting for us is explored. And logically. I recommend this book just for the sake of expanding your thoughts on outer space and the future of where humankind may end up."

158,0241304849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61646219-roya,5,"It was my first experience in reading science books like this one. Off course It was a pleasant experience because it get me acquainted with a world which I was unfamiliar with. Reading "" The future of humanity"", I thought about many serious subjects and my mind was blowing up with interesting informations about almost everything. From space to physics theories, everything was explained in simple words and that was the beauty of this book. Reading this book gives you a clear insight about the future of us as humans and discusses several probable possibilities in the long life span of humankind during his/her adventure in the space. I recommend those who are new to this genre, to read this work as their first experience, and I promise that it will be their best first experience!📚😊"
159,0241304849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7258380-dan-graser,4,"In his latest work, physicist Michio Kaku has focused on the what the future life of humanity might be as pertains to several possible scenarios. Throughout the work he mostly does a decent job of suggesting how plausible these ideas are, or at the very least, the type of timeframe needed to develop the requisite technological capabilities to achieve them. Beginning with the colonization of Mars, Kaku does a fine job of explaining just how this very popular notion would have to work, the costs involved, where our current capabilities stand, and just who is at the forefront of this quest. As NASA continues to be underfunded, though they do have a Mars program in operation, private funding has taken over much of this territory and the competition created by these developments is changing just how (some, particularly wealthy) humans may leave this planet for good.Next Kaku takes up the idea of interstellar travel. This is one area where the type of technology required is hundreds of years away. This distances to other star systems is staggering, our technology still primitive, and the pace at which we could develop any sort of device traveling remotely close to the speed of light is very difficult to predict. Some hugely interesting ideas are posited but he is quick to note that many of these are at the moment very unrealistic.The intersection of AI and humanity is discussed but not in particularly great detail. I would recommend Max Tegmark on this subject as his picture is a bit more complete. Anyone who has read the literature on this likely already has a more thorough understanding than is presented in this section.Finally and perhaps most significantly, Kaku details what physics tells us about the end of space and time and the possibility to forestall these dire (though billions of years in the future) events with technology developed to harness the gravitational effect of dark matter and dark energy. As we still have no idea as to the workings of either of these this is of course purely speculative but this is the first I've heard of these compelling ideas. As with all of his books, Kaku is an engaging and accessible writer that only occasionally veers into oversimplification or inclusion of ideas purely for their mass appeal, not for their plausibility. This is an effective summary of where we are as pertains to the possible routes humanity might take to ensure, at the level of our entire species, our survival. Wonderful reading all around."
160,0241304849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8676317-a-man-called-ove,4,"अनंत से भी आगे !4.5/5 Michio Kaku reminds me of APJ Abdul Kalam in his optimism and enthusiasm about the future. Unlike pessimists like Harari who fear human life becoming meaningless by advances in AI, he imagines using progresses in technology to settle and terraform Mars and elsewhere ! The first section which focuses on near future technologies and space travel was an absolute delight.Also, his vision is not limited to the next decade or 20 years, he also talks about possibilities in the next 100 and 1000 years and even later. Except for the last chapters on wormholes and time-travel which felt weird, enjoyed this joyride. A bit like a spiritual guru the author was expanding my mind’s horizons with his thought-experiments.Will be reading more by this author."

The last section on string theory and quantum physics was too advanced for me, unfortunately. Overall, I learned some fascination information about our galaxy, technological innovations, space travel, and threats to our planet. I do recommend it!"
162,0241304849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67214408-sathya,3,"If not for the end chapters where there is just too much discussion on theoretical physics, which does not seem entirely related to the subject matter of the book, or the seemingly very broad thought leaps on how we will become a multi-galactic species in the far future, this is a fascinating read on the near-future impact of space travel and the potential move to Mars. "
163,0241304849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2433243-ayami,4,"Michio Kaku talks about a lot of interesting concepts regarding technology, space exploration and science. It wasn’t a mind-blowing read, though, as the majority of what he talks about has been mentioned in plenty of other non-fiction books out there. However, I won’t penalize the book for introducing themes I happened to be already familiar with. Some physics stuff I found hard to follow but this could be due to the fact, I was listening to it as an audiobook. Some reviewers complained about the onslaught of the pop culture references but I enjoyed them and think they were pretty well incorporated into the text. This could be because I have seen the majority of the movies mentioned, though. "
164,0241304849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31705923-zahan,3,"Interesting content, but I'm not a huge fan of the writing. It’s really surface-level, leaping across one discipline to another. As someone well-familiar with the scientific principles, I almost rather he focus on fewer topics, but cover them more in-depth.Also, he’s often describing implementation for problems so far out that really all we should be talking about is principles and concepts.Good food for thought, but unfortunately not as satisfying as I’d hoped!"
165,0241304849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/106503484-connor-steckly,4,"This book is not too long but seemingly has no scope. The wide range of topics it covers acts as a good introduction to the leading edge (and beyond) technologies that will enable humanity to live on multiple planets and moons across the universe. Although the last two chapters were overly technical, the book overall was fantastic and scratched the surface on a number of topics to look into further. "
166,0241304849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12087691-wendyb,4,"Interesting, easily readable.

Topics range from propulsion systems to AI and biological enhancements. While a number of the author's ideas are not particularly convincing, virtually all are interesting."
170,0241304849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6991670-bob,4,"Summary: An exploration of the possibility and necessity of humanity becoming a multi-planetary species, and the revolutions of technology necessary to realize that future.Michio Kaku is a theoretical theorist studying string theory at the City University of New York, and the author of a series of best-selling futurist works based on his knowledge of physics and other fields. He is also a riveting, passionate speaker who believes, along with others like Elon Musk, that we must envision becoming a multi-planetary species. This, the latest of his books, explores that idea, it's necessity, and the technological advances that could make this possible.Kaku argument for the necessity of becoming a multi-planetary species is rooted in the priority of the survival of the human species. He is convinced that, whether through physical causes ranging from cataclysmic volcanoes to asteroids or the final death throes of the sun, our planet will become unlivable for human beings--if we do not accomplish this first through human causation as in nuclear holocaust or global warming. Discussing other great challenges we've faced through history, he writes:But now we face perhaps the greatest challenge of all: to leave the confines of the Earth and soar into outer space. The laws of physics are clear; sooner or later we will face global crises that threaten our very existence. (p.6)In three parts he explores the technologies that can make this possible. The first part explores interplanetary settlement efforts within our solar system, using moon as a base, and Mars as our first settlement, and later possibly settling, or exploiting the resources of the large moons orbiting the gas giants of Jupiter and Saturn. He describes existing efforts by public and private enterprise to return to the moon and create settlements on Mars. This itself is formidable considering exposures to radioactivity and the inhospitable nature of the planet but he argues for the eventual possibility of terra-forming Mars, making it livable and life sustaining. What is fascinating is that much of this is possible by applying and extending our current technology, albeit at great cost.The second part of the book seemed like something out of Star Trek, exploring the technologies of interstellar travel. All of this is beyond our current technologies. As a physicist, he takes us on a tour of possible technologies from nanoships and laser and solar sail propelled vehicles, to ramjet fusion and antimatter engines, and proposes that the warp drive of The Enterprise is possible, and consists not in propelling one faster than light, but literally warping space so that a vessel is pulled through it at hyper light speeds. Nearly all of this requires inordinately great quantities of energy, and presupposes a level of civilization at which we harness, first the energies of the sun, and than galactic levels of energy. This will allow us to explore at least the nearby stars or further into a galaxy of stars where it is increasingly evident that there are many possible habitable planets.The third part explores the reality that the great distances to be traveled, even should we exceed the speed of light, either require multi-generational crews, or advances toward immortality. He explores research on curing aging, on trans-humanism in which humans and machines become increasingly integrated. He discusses the Human Connectome Project, in which human neural networks are mapped, digitized, and potentially could be reproduced light years away, transmitted via laser networks. He also speculates on the existence of other more advanced civilizations. He mentions observations of recurring drops in energy output of star KIC 8462852 by as much as 30 percent positing an object 22 times as large as Jupiter, speculating that one possibility would be a megastructure like a Dyson sphere constructed by an alien civilization.This part also gets into Kaku's area of theoretical physics, string theory, as he explores the possibility of travel through wormholes and stargates and perhaps even escaping the present universe into one of many multiverses, particularly useful when this one burns out.Whew! Kaku's tour of the technologies necessary for interstellar travel is both breathtaking, and staggering. On one hand, much of the technology we use today, even that I am using as I write, was science fiction in my childhood. It is always dangerous to scoff at what seems impossible. The cell phone at my side represents applications of theoretical physics unknown 150 years ago in terms of the miniaturized circuitry and memory, cellular and wi-fi capabilities, GPS tracking, and touch screens. What would have been an object of wonder 150 years ago is now a commonplace of many of our lives. Yet what Kaku describes in this book, particularly in parts two and three, strings together ventures of immense cost, requiring unimaginable amounts of power, huge quantities of rare (and dangerous) resources like anti-matter, as well as scenarios, the survivability of which are in question, all of which to preserve the human species on a multi-planetary scale. Of course Kaku allows millenia for reaching such capabilities.The most credible part of the book for me was the near-term ideas of travel to Mars, perhaps even establishing some form of outpost there. If something of a cataclysmic nature were to occur on Earth in the next couple centuries, such an outpost might preserve civilization, and even re-settle earth. Even this is tremendously costly as well as risky. We must expect lives to be lost, even as they were among other explorers and settlers throughout our history. But it also raised questions of several sorts.Some were questions of priority. Should we think of terra-forming Mars when our own planet's earth, water and air need so much attention? Should we pour huge funds and inordinate amounts of energy into space travel when transport on earth is still carbon-based and polluting? When we are not yet addressing preventable diseases of childhood, and providing quality and affordable health care on a global basis, is it right to pour huge amounts into life-extending technologies that may benefit a select few? Or even as we think about planetary defense, might we focus on technologies for detection and destruction of planet-threatening objects from outer space? All this falls under the question of caring for the planet and people that we have before we think about settling other worlds.Some are more fundamental questions having to do with whether we ought to do these things. I think of this particularly around the discussion of immortality. Kaku fails to deal with the issue of whether it is a good thing for humans with our flawed as well as noble nature to live for ever. Have you ever noticed how, as people age, they become who they always were, to an even greater degree? We may grow both more loving and more neurotic. We may grow more knowledgeable and more petty. The closest he gets to this is when he quotes the late Stephen Hawking who said, ""We only have to look at ourselves to see how intelligent life might develop into something we wouldn't want to meet."" In my own faith tradition, we believe that it is a severe mercy of God that flawed and fallen people don't live endlessly in our bodies and that hope is found not in endless mortal life, but life everlasting beyond bodily death.Finally, I am troubled with the hubristic strains that carry as much attraction for many contemporary hearers as they did for the first couple in the garden, and the tower builders of Babel. Kaku writes:...our destiny is to become the gods we once feared and worshipped. Science will give us the means by which we can shape the universe in our image. The question is whether we will have the wisdom of Solomon to accompany this vast celestial power. (p. 14)""You shall be as gods"" has been a temptation from the very beginning, and is one this book proffers to its readers. Along with that temptation comes tower-building (or space elevator) projects that reflect our pitiful efforts to offset our creaturely vulnerabilities. Will we exchange dependence on the sustenance of the Creator and responsible care for the world we've been given for anxious and costly efforts to preserve ourselves in other worlds, and perhaps neglect the most vulnerable on our own planet? I find the reference to Solomon fascinating, because the record tells us that, while wise, he abandoned the fear of God which is the beginning of wisdom, giving himself to building projects that taxed and enslaved, and that he multiplied wives and experiences. If Ecclesiastes gives us the final verdict on this project, it is all summed up as ""meaningless,"" ""a chasing after the wind,"" and that ""with much wisdom comes much sorrow."" It seems that this is what always comes of trying to make ourselves gods, and trying to stave off death when a universe of wonder and a world of beauty to be cared for beckons us to trust its Maker."

The first and foremost thought I had while reading this book was how shockingly poor my knowledge in astronomy was. The book covers a vast variety of concepts pertaining to universe, space travel, relativity, quantum theory, time travel and other likes written in a lucid fashion."
172,0241304849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1639329-erik,2,"A mile wide, an inch deep. It's simple to the point of being erroneous: He'll spend a single sentence glossing over a profound problem that'll take billions of manhours to resolve. Not to mention some truly stupid claims in here, such as his belief that only human beings (as opposed to other animals) possess an awareness of time. That's incorrect by inspection.And worse - it's boring. It feels less like ""The Future of Humanity"" and more like ""Cliffnotes of the Future of Humanity."" You would be vastly better served reading a science fiction book that explores these ideas of interstellar travel, generation arks, AI, etc. The Martian; The Expanse; etc, etc.BUT one major positive is just how much research this book inspired me into. It has a lot of references to real and underway projects. Following up on these was both fun and informative."
173,0241304849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22189980-belhor,3,"Interesting enough. Kaku is easy to read and I love the fact that he always quotes lots of interesting people in his writing. This book is the second book from Kaku that I've read, and even though I liked his ""Parallel Worlds"" more, this one is also a pretty decent book. I would have liked if he went through a little more details specially in the first chapters. The book gets better when you are almost halfway through."
174,0241304849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21091961-jacques-bezuidenhout,3,"Nice, easy to follow explanation of scientific concepts, and how humans are likely to evolve in future.I might have given the book a higher rating if I didn't already touch on most of the concepts discussed in other books:The Space Barons: Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, and the Quest to Colonize the CosmosHomo Deus: A Brief History of TomorrowA Short History of Nearly EverythingThere is quite a bit of overlap.This book is a nice summary putting the relevant information together and sequencing them chronologically.This book is also fairly new. So some of the facts contained goes up to things happening in 2017, which is nice.The latter part of the book touching on quantum and string theory, starts going over one's head a bit. Although explained as simple as possible, it does become a bit difficult to follow in audio format. You also need to be really open minded to get your head around some of the concepts / possibilities presented for the future. Since most are speculative, and mostly relies on things humans aren't even close to achieving."

Plus, it is a treasure chest of ideas for science fiction writers, who do not have the limitations of time or budget to make new realities come true on a page."
177,0241304849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73029907-cav,5,"This was an exceptionally well-formatted and written book. I really enjoyed it. This is my first from author Michio Kaku, but won't be my last.Kaku writes with a very engaging style, that holds the reader's attention effortlessly. This is a welcome change to many, many other science books I have read that are plagued by long-winded, esoteric and dry writing.The book is written in an easy-to-follow manner that would be suitable for the layperson who may be not too familiar with science. Kaku is an extremely effective science communicator; he takes complicated ideas, and conveys them in a simple and easy to understand manner. We need many more like him, IMHO.As mentioned, the book's formatting is excellent, as well. It is broken down into 3 main parts:
1) LEAVING THE EARTH2) VOYAGE TO THE STARS3) LIFE IN THE UNIVERSE
Which then break further down into different chapters. Kaku ends most chapters with a really natural segway to the upcoming one. The book has an excellent flow to it.If you were a fan of sci-fi as a kid, or are curious about what the future has in store for the human race, then this book is for you. The Future of Humanity covers (among many others): *The history of rockets; pioneers Goddard and von Braun.*Missions to the moon and Mars; the possibilities of living on either.*The asteroid belt, and possibilities of mining them.*The gas giants, Venus, Titan, and other moons.*Robotics, AI, and self-replicating robots.*Transhumanism*Spaceships; different theoretical technologies, and rocket types.*Black holes, wormholes, and spacetime.*The possibility of life on other worlds.*String theory and multiverses.I thoroughly enjoyed this book, and would most definitely recommend it to anyone interested in astronomy, physics, and the future of humanity in general. It is a big-picture book, with many incredible ideas that are sure to capture your imagination.5 stars, and a spot on my ""Favorites"" shelf."
178,0241304849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25338445-angie-reisetter,3,"Kaku is a great tour guide to the possibilities of the distant future. He imagines what may be possible, or at least what is not ruled out by the laws of physics as we know them. He has the tendency in this book, as he does in his others, to introduce topics with words like ""perhaps"" and ""might"", and then to drop them altogether, so that it sounds like he is telling us what will happen, casting aside minor difficulties like cost and human will. He threads science fiction references throughout his narrative, almost organizing his argument by what he's seen/read in science fiction. That's not a terrible way to go, but he also blurs the line of reality there, asking himself how we reconcile two different views of the future, as if they are not fictional and must be reconciled. The whole thing is very entertaining. But he has a theorist's tendency to discount reality, which is always my criticism of his work. But I did come back for more, and his work is always worth reading. A little inspiration is called for right about now.There seem to be a number of science futures becoming available in the near future, and I've recently read Soonish: Ten Emerging Technologies That'll Improve and/or Ruin Everything, which is very different from this one. I recommend them both as a study in contrasts: Kaku's extends to the limits of what might be possible one day maybe, and Soonish tries to keep it, well, soonish, in the realm of the reasonably possible. They have some topics in common, but they diverge rather dramatically.I got a copy to review from Net Galley."

I'd love it if you'd check me out and consider following/subscribing.You know, there is a crazy need that people have to judge a book by its title. It almost never is the case that that is what a book is on about. Perhaps a more accurate title would be: This is what Star Trek envisions and here's the status on where we're at. In that case, the book is amazing b/c it's quite hard to get that accomplished. If you look at the sea of references in the back and also read it, you'll realize how difficult it was to write something that is this comprehensive, albiet, much of detais of his reference are in the footnotes. p. 2 - He talks about the similarities between humans vs. chimps as a cohort a supposes that some cataclysmic event took out the genetic diversity that once was.p. 20 ""The amount of fuel you need reises exponentially with the change in velocity so that enormous amounts of fuel are needed to give an extra boost to speed."" (ok, a little wordy. What he's saying is it's hard to increasingly acceleration (that's what change in velocity is). You're going to need to accellorate for a while and at a crazy high speed if you want to leave earth for another planet. They are pretty far away.p. 32 - He deals with some of the politics and economics. He talks about it being easier to fund a person going into space vs program itself. As a result, many compromises (as that's more expensive to support life vs. just do unmanned missions).p. 33 - ""It takes $10k to put a pound of anything up in space.""p. 34 - The story of the great imperial fleet of Admiral Zheng 1405 - 1433. I really want to look thi up, b/c this was a big deal as relates to why there are Chinese people in specific places on the earth like Madagascar. Glad to finally get a citation. p. 40 Jules Verne's method of shooting someone to the moon predates rocket fuel. That's a major innovation. Blue Origin - company by Bezo's rocket system is called New ShepardElon Musk's Space X is called Falcon Rocket.p. 41Blue origin is billing it as a tourism voyage with an orientation.p. 43 Beso's vision: ""The whole idea is to perserve the Earth... The goal [is] to be able to evacuate humans. The planet would become a park."" All the waste would be ejected into space. In 2017 he announced his plans: ""Once considered a lonely outpost in space, the moon would become a bustling industrial and commercial hub with permanent manned bases and manufacturing."" p. 44 Moon Express plans on mining the moon.p. 45 The outer space treaty does not contain any language related to real estate ownership of the moon and it's annoying to many people to think of it.p. 47 - The book moves into the other tech that has to exist if you're legit going to go the moon. The first has to do with medical care. Robots need to get better for things like remote-controlled surgery. Similarly a lot more work has to go in withstanding radiation.p. 50 Talks about how the moon was formed through a huge impact billions of years ago. The Earth looked like packman and the Moon a slice. All that changed through gravity.p. 62 - Musk's company's vision to Mars...he's on track to try to send a manned mission to mars by 2024. Typically estimates have said it would cost betwen $400-500b. He's trying to do it for $10bln. He's trying to get the price down per ride to $200k so that it competes with Virgin's galactic SpaceShipTwo. There's also pricing for the Russian rocket International Space Station which is $20-40m. I never knew the price of this stuff. Nice.p. 67 The total failure (which is always fatal) of going into space is about 1.5% (3 failures out of 135) with the fatality count being about 3.3%. With mars, most satellites do not make it there (3/4ths do not).p. 85 - MDRS Mars Desert Research station attempts to make realistic situations to determine the psychological effects of being on MARS.p. 87 - Terraforming in terms of DNA. There is an idea that DNA came from Mars and transformed the earth. p. 93 - They believe that MARS lost its magnetic field (necessary to protect the planet) from heavy bombardment. It's why the core is solid vs. lava like ours.p. 94 - ""The Earth is larger than Mars, so it did not coll down as quickly. The Earth also did not suffer a collapse of its magnetic field caused by giant meteor impacts."" p. 99 - Some people want to break off a piece of Europa and bring it to mars to repopulate the planet with water.p. 103 - Titan has atmosphere and would actually support life, though we'd stll need a few other things. p. 116 - The use of AI to help explore the planets in preparation for human entrance. Or alternatively,we just move our organic body into a computer one so we can enjoy space travel.p. 118 - He introduces Neural Networks p. 121 - Self-replicating robots are necessary in space. this describes what they have to be like.p. 129 He has a theory that humans differ from animals b/c we notice time. I'm not 100% sure I agree. but ok.p. 156 HE talks about the challenge of stopping a rocket ship.p. 158 The space elevator is another option often tossed around.p. 169 Parallax. didn't know that word.p. 170 - Talks about how we find planets with minor dimming of light.p. 178 talks about rogue planets.p. 190 sets up for the idea that medical drives the ability of humans to expand into new territories.Solving aging (telemeers) is about allowing us to go to space.p. 204 Again putting you in a robot might work.p. 206 - They talk about the exoskeleton and where that's at.p. 211 - The chip in glasses to type out a sentence is early stage communication via just neural activity.p. 226- What if alliens are WAY ahead of us? p. 233 - It almost goes backward in talking about what makes Humans the best on earth. It's not b/c we are strong We are actually worthless in strengh and other characteristics.p. 248 A dyson sphere is created around a star to harness the energy that comes off of it.p. 258 They are looking for someone that has done this in the galaxy to see if some other species has left a big footprint like we have on earth. So far, no luck.p. 261 Talks about how DNA can demonstrate the rate of divergence/mutation. It's really slow. Weird would have thought it would be driven by the amount/speed of procreation. p. 323 A great reading list. I'd like to one day take a look at all of these books."

182,0241304849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22443749-debbie,4,"4.5 starsThe Future of Humanity is a fascinating piece of speculative astrophysics and science which seeks to explore the various ways humanity may expand our civilization across the universe. I thoroughly enjoyed how in depth Kaku got, not just laying out the potential opportunities but also fully explaining the science behind the theories. Despite this heavily scientific approach, this book never felt boring or overwhelming. Even if some of the topics were a little far-fetched, it was nevertheless an intriguing and engaging read.—75,000 years ago there was a major volcanic eruption (Topa); considered the biggest eruption in the past 25 million years. Some scientists speculate only 2,000 humans remained and had to repopulate, which is why DNA between people even if they’re not related is surprisingly similarWhen you consider every single creature that has ever lived on the earth such as amoebas, plants, dinosaurs etc., you find that 99.9% have gone extinct, meaning the creatures and living things that are alive today are an extremely small sliver of all the living things that have ever lived on the planetOur earth has gone through 5 major extinction cycles in our history, in which up to 90% of the living species went extinct at a timeBecause our galaxy has 100 billion stars there may be as many as 20 billion Earth sized planets in the Milky Way galaxy. it’s estimated there is 2 billion trillion earth sized planets in the visible universe including galaxies outside our ownThere is actually gravity in space and the feeling/illusion of weightlessness is because everything falls at the same rate so astronauts are falling at the same rate as the spaceshipIn the future, we may use the moon as a gas station, because ice at the South Pole can be used to farm oxygen and hydrogen which are primary components of rocket fuel, and also rare earth metals found there as well which are also able to be made into fuel. Helium 3 is also expected to be on the moon, which can be used for Fusion reactors. There is also talk of finding platinum. All this raises the question of whether it’s legal to mine on the moon and if so who can stake a claim on itIf we built a living space on the moon, at first it would need to be sent supplies from Earth every few weeks. The astronauts could use Internet, cell phones etc. as normal once they set up the proper technology because the delay between earth and the moon is only one second. They could potentially farm oxygen from the soil and water from the ice caps. The bases may be built underground to protect from solar radiation. There will need to be large amounts of solar panels because a moon day lasts an Earth month, so there are 2 weeks of day followed by 2 weeks of nightYour blood boils in the vacuum of space because as pressure drops the boiling point of water also dropsAstroids contain iron, nickel, carbon & cobalt, as well as significant quantities of rare earth metals and valuable metals including irradium, platinum, and rodium. It is believed that we will eventually mine the astroid belt, and many entrepreneurs have already expressed interest in finding ways to do so. 12 astroids have already been identified as key targets for mining, because only a slight nudge to their orbit would bring them closer towards earth and the moon and able to enter into orbit, making mining them much more efficientElon musk‘s goal with space X is to reduce the cost of commercial space travel by 10x. He was the 1st to invent a reusable booster capsule module rather than discarding it after use. His ultimate goal is to make it to Mars. His goal is to send a manned mission to Mars by 2024. He envisions eventually the cost of sending someone to Mars will be $200,000/person round-tripIt only takes 3?days to get to the moon but 9 months to get to Mars. A round trip to Mars would take 2 years. Potential dangers during this deep space trip include excessive exposure to radiation, damage to the ship from solar flares or micro astroids, muscular atrophy from being in reduced gravity so long, and psychological side effectsNASA plans on having a manned mission arrive at Mars by 2033; this plan involves creating a lunar space station from which ships could go to Mars, rather than going directly to Mars like space XLike the moon, explorers on Mars would be able to harvest water, oxygen, and hydrogen from the permafrost and ice to serve as sources for water, oxygen, and fuel. The days on Mars are similar in length to days on earth, but the temperature is extremely cold, barely above the freezing point of water during the day and dropping drastically at night. Like the moon, the gravity is less so explorers would have to exercise daily to avoid muscular atrophy and loss of bone density. Mars has both water ice caps and dry ice/CO2 ice caps. The water ice caps stay consistent year round, but the dry ice caps fluctuate with the seasons and mostly evaporate in the summerFor Mars to become truly habitable, we would need to find a way to slowly heat the atmosphere so liquid water could flow on the surface, allowing for plants to grow outside of contained greenhouses. Terraforming mars is probably centuries away, and may be prohibitively costly. To artificially raise the temperature of the planet, we may inject water vapor and methane into the atmosphere to create a greenhouse effect, or send satellites into orbit over the ice caps to direct concentrated sunlight towards the caps to cause them to melt and release water vapor. Eventually, this warming process would become self-sustaining as well as increase the atmospheric pressure of mars. As plants grow and proliferate, dying plants will enrich the soil, and growing plants will add oxygen to the atmosphereMars cooled down slower than Earth did. Mars no longer has a molten core but rather a solid rock core, so it doesn’t have a magnetic field. This is one of the factors that accelerated Mars’s atmosphere loss. Also, the carbon dioxide is mostly trapped in the ground instead of proliferating in the atmosphere, causing a reverse greenhouse effectSome of the moons of the gas giants are also viewed as potential candidates for human coloniesThe gas giants are theorized to have a thick gaseous atmosphere, a cold liquid hydrogen ocean around the entire planet, and a small, solid hydrogen core because of the extreme pressures. Jupiter is surrounded by radiation, which causes Radio interference. The gravity of Jupiter actually helps protect the earth from being bombarded by astroids because it essentially serves as a vacuum cleanerTitan (a moon of Saturn) is a potential candidate for human colonization, but because it’s so far away it can’t have self-sustaining greenhouse effect, and the lakes of ethane Could combust if it got too hot. But it could be a source of fuel. And it’s one of the few places in our solar system where we would be able to go outside without a spacesuit because it has enough of an atmosphere that our blood wouldn’t boil/we wouldn’t be crushed (we’d still need an oxygen mask). Europa (a moon of Jupiter) has potential for microbial life in its ocean (which sits under the layer of ice that encircles the moon, and was made possible because of friction caused from the extreme tidal forces caused by Jupiter’s gravity)All the gas giants have rings, which are likely caused by moons that got too close to the planet being torn apart by the planet’s gravityTitan and the Kuiper belt would most likely serve as refueling stations or points from which to jump to the next star or planetGraphene/carbon nanotubes will likely be the material used to make infrastructure on other planets, because it’s immensely strong yet incredibly light. We’re not at a point yet where we can mass produce it, because even a small impurity can ruin it, but once we have the technology to do so, it’ll be the best material to use. It could even be used to create skin-tight, lightweight spacesuitsFor Interstellar and planetary colonization to be realistic, we would need automatons—robots with more intelligence than our current ones who can perform a wide variety of tasks such as building cities on planets and moons, which would be easier for a robot (doesn’t need a spacesuit, doesn’t get affected by radiation, isn’t limited by oxygen supply, etc)Getting robots to understand common sense has been extremely difficult and currently prevents them from fully perceiving and navigating the world. Currently robots need human intervention to do most tasks. Modern robots will likely be a combination of top down and bottom up learning; they will have some information already integrated into their systems but they will also have neural networks that will allow them to learn from repetition and gain common sense. Robots would also need to be self replicatingIon engines may make it possible for the trip to Mars to take 40 days rather than 9 monthsPotential energy sources for traveling at the speed of light include light sailing (propelling with lasers), nuclear energy (propelling with nuclear explosions), and antimatter energy. an antimatter rocket would have 100% energy efficiency, whereas nuclear explosion only has 1% because most of the Energy is wasted. However only a very small amount of anti-matter exists naturally, so we would have to manufacture it (currently extremely expensive). Storing the antimatter would be difficult because it would have to be stored in a trap that suspends it in a magnetic field so it’s not able to touch the edges of the container; if it touch the edges it would destroy the containerSomething that would help make getting materials into space much easier and more economical is creating a space elevator that stretches from the surface of the earth out above our atmosphere. Scientists predict that it is theoretically possible to do so, possibly even by 2035, but we would need to find a way to make enough strong enough Materials for this to be feasible. Ideally pure carbon nanotubes would be used, but right now it would be difficult to make as much as would be neededTo travel faster than light at warp speed, we need to find a way to make vast quantities of negative matter or negative energy. We’ve been able to make small amounts of negative energy, but we are nowhere close to producing the amount needed to even consider developing warp drivesSuspended animation/cryogenic freezing to allow longer voyages without needing generations of people to live on a spaceship is currently not possible. While other animals are able to survive in suspended animation because of the levels of glucose in their blood which prevents their blood from freezing, the amount of sugar needed is too high for humansTelomeres are part of our chromosomes that get shorter with aging; when they get too short the cells can no longer divide. If we can prevent that shortening from happening, it would increase our life span because our cells would be able to divide and replicate themselves longer. However, cancer operates in the same way and is essentially immortal, so that would be a riskIf we were able to identify exactly what parts of our genetic make up contribute to aging, we could alter our genes to expand our life expectancyAging is thought to be the accumulation of errors in our genetic make up over time, so if we can prevent those errors from happening because of deteriorating cell replication then we can slow down the aging processIf we were able to somehow make ourselves inmortal, or drastically increase our life expectancy, then we would likely have to deal with extreme overpopulation eventually. Before the Industrial Revolution, the human population of the earth was 300 million or less. It has now grown to 7.5 billion and is anticipated to increase by 1 billion every 12 years. It is estimated that there will be 11.2 billion people on the earth by 2100. However, others argued that our increase in population is slowly going down and will stabilize before we reach a level of overpopulationA primate has never been cloned. If we come to the point where human cloning is possible, it is likely that only a small percentage of the population would do so. It is also speculated that eventually we will find ways to modify our genes or enhance our bodies through cybernetics, but we will likely not take it so far that we drastically modify our appearance. Modifications would likely be improvements to existing issues (ex: eyesight) or ways to improve our social standing, rather than becoming creatures with giant heads and huge eyes and skinny bodies. Our use of cybernetics would prevent us from evolving that drastically. If we were to disperse in colonies across the galaxy, our genetic makeup would remain within 0.1% difference between colonies (same as between humans currently)We may in the next century or so develop ways to laser port our consciousness across the galaxy so our physical bodies could remain in place while our consciousness is able to move at the speed of light to visit other places by being ported it into an avatarEarth like planets need to be accompanied by large gaseous Jupiter like planets to clear out incoming astroids. They also need to be accompanied by a larger moon to stabilize their spin and trajectoryThe drake equation attempts to estimate the probability that we will make contact with intelligent life forms; however there is still a lot of unknowns that prevent us from having an accurate assessment from this equationIf there are intelligent beings on other planets, we can’t assume that they communicate vocally the same way we do. They might communicate through pheromones like bugs, or sonar like batsIntelligent life will likely follow the laws of evolution. An intelligent species will likely be descended from predators, so it will have forward facing eyes. They will also likely have opposable thumbs or some type of grasping appendage. They will also have some form of languageKardishev scale of civilizations: A type 1 civilization (planetary) uses all the energy of the sunlight that falls on the planet. Type 2 civilization (stellar) uses all the energy it’s sun produces. A type 3 civilization (galactic) uses the energy of an entire galaxy. We are currently a type 0.7 civilization because we’re not using the full energy of all the sunlight shining on our planet. We are about a century or two away from becoming a full type 1, and possibly A few thousand years from becoming a type 2. We might not become type 3 for 100,000 years or even up to 1 million because it requires a level of interstellar travel that we’re nowhere close to having. The energy measurements for each type just means and equivalent amount of energy, it doesn’t mean you have to be getting all your energy from the sun. Each next level of civilization is between 10 to 100 billion times more powerful than the previous typeA civilization that has reached type 2 is likely nearly immortal, and most of its energy generating machinery will likely be placed off planet because there will be so much energy being produced that it creates too much heat for the planet to be habitable. They will likely also harvest energy from their sun through a Dyson sphere and because of the vast quantities they are harvesting Will emit infrared radiationThere is another scale of civilization that is calculated based on the amount of information it consumes as proposed by Carl Sagan. Type A civilization consumes 1,000,000 bits of information. Type Z civilization consumes a 10^31 bits of information. We are a type H civilization. By this scale a type two civilization would be able to consume energy through widely distributed Dyson sphere, harvesting from astroids, developing super efficient nano technology, etc. and avoid giving up the levels of infrared radiation that would make it detectable to usOur first encounter with alien civilization will likely be a robotic self replicating probeString theory exists in 10 dimensions. It cancels out quantum corrections, basically meaning it cancels out the fact that quantum things like electrons and protons are able to be in multiple places at once. This quantum cancellation can only happen in 10 dimensions. The pairing for particles in string theory is sparticles, quarks are squarks, etc. String theory assumes an infinite number of universes (Multiverse). String theory says the universe was originally 10 dimensions, then for some reason the other 6 dimensions “curled up” leaving us with only 4 perceivable dimensionsDark matter was discovered because astrophysicist realized that the Milky Way was spinning 10 times faster than Newtonian physics would allow without flying apart, so they realize there must be some invisible thing adding all that extra mass to the galaxy. Dark matter is invisible, but it bends starlight so we’re able to detect it that way. Dark matter has gravity, but can’t be held/interact with matter in any way. It’s electrically neutral and only interacts with gravity. However we’ve never been able to officially prove that dark matter exist yet or create it ourselves in any way. Once we do, it will prove string theoryString theory is the only way would be able to do calculations about the quantum corrections needed for time travel, going through a wormhole, faster than light travel, etcThe universe is expected to eventually end in 1 of 3 ways: the big crunch, the big freeze, or the big rip. The big crunch is when the expansion of the universe slow down, stops, and reverses itself, eventually coalescing in a giant wad of superheated matter and possibly eventually turning into another big bang. For the big freeze, by the laws of entropy eventually the stars will stop shining, the sky will go black and temperature will reach absolute zero wherein matter nearly ceases to move. The big rip refers to the fact that the universe is exponentially expanding far faster than anticipated, and that distant galaxies will eventually speed away from us faster than the speed of light and disappear. Eventually our galaxy and solar system would be torn apart from this rapid expansion. The universe would end in an explosion, a singularity of infinite energyOur sun will exhaust its energy in about 5 billion years; it will expand into a red giant star which will essentially set the earth on fire, mountains will melt, oceans will boil, and the earth will be engulfed. After this, the sun will exhaust all its nuclear fuel and shrink and go cold as a white dwarf and then die as a dark dwarf star. In 4.8 billion years, the Milky Way and Andromeda galaxy’s will collide. There are two black holes will collide and merge and a new galaxy will eventually be formedDark energy is the energy of a vacuum. It acts like antigravity, and it pushes the universe apart. It is different than dark matter. The more the universe expands, the more dark energy there is, which makes the universe expand faster. About 69% of the matter/energy in the universe is contained in dark energy. Dark matter makes up 26%. Atoms of hydrogen and helium make up about 5%. And other higher elements that make up the earth, our bodies, etc. only make up 0.5%A possible way to overcome the eventual death of our universe is by becoming a type 4 civilization that harnesses extragalactic energy like dark energy and is able to reverse the big rip by creating a sphere in which dark energy reverses polarity so that inside the sphere The galaxies continue to survive normally while outside the sphere the universe is continuing to expand rapidly and tear itself apart. Another possible solution is that we find a way to leave our universe and go to one of the other theoretical bubble universes in the Multiverse. They could use negative energy to create a wormhole. The bubble universes are floating in a 10 dimensional arena—Read for the Astronomy prompt for the 2019 OWLs Readathon"

The second reason for listening twice is that it is chock full of info that is easy to miss in an audio format - so I also downloaded the Kindle version...I love Michio Kaku’s books. This one is about fun science of the future. Space travel - where are we, what do we still need to do, where would we go, how would we need to alter ourselves for outer space, what spacecrafts would we use, etc. Fun stuff, all told in an approachable, interesting story format. Kaku loves science fiction and peppers the narrative with movie and book references. Interestingly enough, he judges most of it more science and less fiction. Kaku is a physics professor, thus the physics are very solid; but I have my doubts on some of the biotechnology parts. Nevertheless, a thoroughly enjoyable book that I ended up listening to within about a day."
184,0241304849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8686546-feyzan---the-raven-boy,3,"3.5 starsthe journey of a thousand miles begins with the first stepI don't know what I was thinking when I picked this book up. I don't usually like to read books that are dense with physics and cosmology, but I admire michio kaku so i had to give this one a try. I am not surprised to feel disappointed, however. This book was pretty good on entertainment, and I understand why nerds would love it, but it did nothing for me, except maybe entertain a little. I couldn't take this book seriously as it was brimming with speculations about things that may or may not happen in next 5 billion years. I mean instead of worrying about what will happen in 5 billion years shouldn't we focus on saving our planet from all the man made chaos?I enjoyed the science fiction elements and reading about how tenaciously scientists are trying to make science fiction a new reality for humanity. It was all very interesting to read. The book covered many topics like terraforming, multi-verse, robotics, transhumanism. All these heavy and dense topic were easier to grasp and understand thanks to michio kaku's writing style and movie references. It feels like a new war is in order between the richest people of the world as they compete to colonize Mars and the universe itself. I think these rich people, Instead of spending billions of dollars on space exploration and planning to colonize other planets, should spend some of their foturne and influence to make this planet safe for everyone, Just saying. When I was a kid I used to dream about meeting aliens, going on a mission to space and whatnot. My imaginations used to very elaborated,  I used to imagine alines and robots in a very fanciful way. Robots used to have chips inside of them that could shut them off, if they tried to take over the world. Then I grew up. However, reading this book made me realize that some people are incapable of growing up.
 When self-aware robots do arrive, we must add a fail-safe chip that will shut them off if they have murderous thoughts.
I mean, first of all, no self aware robot is arriving anytime soon. Second of all, no self-aware robot will insert a chip inside of itself (I forgot to mention these robots are supposed to be self-replicating too.) Anyway, you get the idea this book is high on speculation and overflowing with head-scratching logic.
In 2017, a controversy arose between two billionaires, Mark Zuckerberg, founder of Facebook, and Elon Musk of SpaceX and Tesla. Zuckerberg maintained that artificial intelligence was a great generator of wealth and prosperity that will enrich all of society. Musk, however, took a much darker view and stated that AI actually posed an existential risk to all of humanity, that one day our creations may turn on us.
Wow, this exactly what we needed to be discussing right now. 🙄 Zuckerbergs' first concern should be to be make Facebook safe and secure again, not this. And then this book celebrate psychotic maniacs and call them heroes. 
 He confided to me that he takes several hundred pills a day, anticipating his own immortality
I guess, this book isn't meant to be taken seriously. It's just good to get inside the heads of scientists and learn how they operate and how they see the future. This book has imbued me with unnecessary knowledge that I don't know where and how to use. This knowledge is increasing my, already soaring, existential angst that wont rest until I use this knowledge somewhere. Anyway, this book isn't bad. It just wasn't for me. I am sure nerds and Sci-fi fans will love it."

Kaku addresses the possibilities of setting up permanent bases on the moon and terraforming Mars. At some point, humanity will need to move beyond the solar system to settle planets revolving around nearby stars. He also addresses genetic changes people may undergo, how humans will begin to merge with AI/machines, and ways immortality may become possible.

It really normalizes the thoughts of leaving Earth and not only exploring beyond, but settling beyond. Even crazier notions of removing our minds from our bodies to travel via laser beams to the exterior of our galaxy into exoskeletons waiting for us is explored. And logically. I recommend this book just for the sake of expanding your thoughts on outer space and the future of where humankind may end up."

Off course It was a pleasant experience because it get me acquainted with a world which I was unfamiliar with. Reading "" The future of humanity"", I thought about many serious subjects and my mind was blowing up with interesting informations about almost everything. From space to physics theories, everything was explained in simple words and that was the beauty of this book. Reading this book gives you a clear insight about the future of us as humans and discusses several probable possibilities in the long life span of humankind during his/her adventure in the space. I recommend those who are new to this genre, to read this work as their first experience, and I promise that it will be their best first experience!📚😊"
189,0241304849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7258380-dan-graser,4,"In his latest work, physicist Michio Kaku has focused on the what the future life of humanity might be as pertains to several possible scenarios. Throughout the work he mostly does a decent job of suggesting how plausible these ideas are, or at the very least, the type of timeframe needed to develop the requisite technological capabilities to achieve them. Beginning with the colonization of Mars, Kaku does a fine job of explaining just how this very popular notion would have to work, the costs involved, where our current capabilities stand, and just who is at the forefront of this quest. As NASA continues to be underfunded, though they do have a Mars program in operation, private funding has taken over much of this territory and the competition created by these developments is changing just how (some, particularly wealthy) humans may leave this planet for good.Next Kaku takes up the idea of interstellar travel. This is one area where the type of technology required is hundreds of years away. This distances to other star systems is staggering, our technology still primitive, and the pace at which we could develop any sort of device traveling remotely close to the speed of light is very difficult to predict. Some hugely interesting ideas are posited but he is quick to note that many of these are at the moment very unrealistic.The intersection of AI and humanity is discussed but not in particularly great detail. I would recommend Max Tegmark on this subject as his picture is a bit more complete. Anyone who has read the literature on this likely already has a more thorough understanding than is presented in this section.Finally and perhaps most significantly, Kaku details what physics tells us about the end of space and time and the possibility to forestall these dire (though billions of years in the future) events with technology developed to harness the gravitational effect of dark matter and dark energy. As we still have no idea as to the workings of either of these this is of course purely speculative but this is the first I've heard of these compelling ideas. As with all of his books, Kaku is an engaging and accessible writer that only occasionally veers into oversimplification or inclusion of ideas purely for their mass appeal, not for their plausibility. This is an effective summary of where we are as pertains to the possible routes humanity might take to ensure, at the level of our entire species, our survival. Wonderful reading all around."

Unlike pessimists like Harari who fear human life becoming meaningless by advances in AI, he imagines using progresses in technology to settle and terraform Mars and elsewhere ! The first section which focuses on near future technologies and space travel was an absolute delight.Also, his vision is not limited to the next decade or 20 years, he also talks about possibilities in the next 100 and 1000 years and even later. Except for the last chapters on wormholes and time-travel which felt weird, enjoyed this joyride. A bit like a spiritual guru the author was expanding my mind’s horizons with his thought-experiments.Will be reading more by this author."

However, I won’t penalize the book for introducing themes I happened to be already familiar with. Some physics stuff I found hard to follow but this could be due to the fact, I was listening to it as an audiobook. Some reviewers complained about the onslaught of the pop culture references but I enjoyed them and think they were pretty well incorporated into the text.

200,0241304849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6991670-bob,4,"Summary: An exploration of the possibility and necessity of humanity becoming a multi-planetary species, and the revolutions of technology necessary to realize that future.Michio Kaku is a theoretical theorist studying string theory at the City University of New York, and the author of a series of best-selling futurist works based on his knowledge of physics and other fields. He is also a riveting, passionate speaker who believes, along with others like Elon Musk, that we must envision becoming a multi-planetary species. This, the latest of his books, explores that idea, it's necessity, and the technological advances that could make this possible.Kaku argument for the necessity of becoming a multi-planetary species is rooted in the priority of the survival of the human species. He is convinced that, whether through physical causes ranging from cataclysmic volcanoes to asteroids or the final death throes of the sun, our planet will become unlivable for human beings--if we do not accomplish this first through human causation as in nuclear holocaust or global warming. Discussing other great challenges we've faced through history, he writes:But now we face perhaps the greatest challenge of all: to leave the confines of the Earth and soar into outer space. The laws of physics are clear; sooner or later we will face global crises that threaten our very existence. (p.6)In three parts he explores the technologies that can make this possible. The first part explores interplanetary settlement efforts within our solar system, using moon as a base, and Mars as our first settlement, and later possibly settling, or exploiting the resources of the large moons orbiting the gas giants of Jupiter and Saturn. He describes existing efforts by public and private enterprise to return to the moon and create settlements on Mars. This itself is formidable considering exposures to radioactivity and the inhospitable nature of the planet but he argues for the eventual possibility of terra-forming Mars, making it livable and life sustaining. What is fascinating is that much of this is possible by applying and extending our current technology, albeit at great cost.The second part of the book seemed like something out of Star Trek, exploring the technologies of interstellar travel. All of this is beyond our current technologies. As a physicist, he takes us on a tour of possible technologies from nanoships and laser and solar sail propelled vehicles, to ramjet fusion and antimatter engines, and proposes that the warp drive of The Enterprise is possible, and consists not in propelling one faster than light, but literally warping space so that a vessel is pulled through it at hyper light speeds. Nearly all of this requires inordinately great quantities of energy, and presupposes a level of civilization at which we harness, first the energies of the sun, and than galactic levels of energy. This will allow us to explore at least the nearby stars or further into a galaxy of stars where it is increasingly evident that there are many possible habitable planets.The third part explores the reality that the great distances to be traveled, even should we exceed the speed of light, either require multi-generational crews, or advances toward immortality. He explores research on curing aging, on trans-humanism in which humans and machines become increasingly integrated. He discusses the Human Connectome Project, in which human neural networks are mapped, digitized, and potentially could be reproduced light years away, transmitted via laser networks. He also speculates on the existence of other more advanced civilizations. He mentions observations of recurring drops in energy output of star KIC 8462852 by as much as 30 percent positing an object 22 times as large as Jupiter, speculating that one possibility would be a megastructure like a Dyson sphere constructed by an alien civilization.This part also gets into Kaku's area of theoretical physics, string theory, as he explores the possibility of travel through wormholes and stargates and perhaps even escaping the present universe into one of many multiverses, particularly useful when this one burns out.Whew! Kaku's tour of the technologies necessary for interstellar travel is both breathtaking, and staggering. On one hand, much of the technology we use today, even that I am using as I write, was science fiction in my childhood. It is always dangerous to scoff at what seems impossible. The cell phone at my side represents applications of theoretical physics unknown 150 years ago in terms of the miniaturized circuitry and memory, cellular and wi-fi capabilities, GPS tracking, and touch screens. What would have been an object of wonder 150 years ago is now a commonplace of many of our lives. Yet what Kaku describes in this book, particularly in parts two and three, strings together ventures of immense cost, requiring unimaginable amounts of power, huge quantities of rare (and dangerous) resources like anti-matter, as well as scenarios, the survivability of which are in question, all of which to preserve the human species on a multi-planetary scale. Of course Kaku allows millenia for reaching such capabilities.The most credible part of the book for me was the near-term ideas of travel to Mars, perhaps even establishing some form of outpost there. If something of a cataclysmic nature were to occur on Earth in the next couple centuries, such an outpost might preserve civilization, and even re-settle earth. Even this is tremendously costly as well as risky. We must expect lives to be lost, even as they were among other explorers and settlers throughout our history. But it also raised questions of several sorts.Some were questions of priority. Should we think of terra-forming Mars when our own planet's earth, water and air need so much attention? Should we pour huge funds and inordinate amounts of energy into space travel when transport on earth is still carbon-based and polluting? When we are not yet addressing preventable diseases of childhood, and providing quality and affordable health care on a global basis, is it right to pour huge amounts into life-extending technologies that may benefit a select few? Or even as we think about planetary defense, might we focus on technologies for detection and destruction of planet-threatening objects from outer space? All this falls under the question of caring for the planet and people that we have before we think about settling other worlds.Some are more fundamental questions having to do with whether we ought to do these things. I think of this particularly around the discussion of immortality. Kaku fails to deal with the issue of whether it is a good thing for humans with our flawed as well as noble nature to live for ever. Have you ever noticed how, as people age, they become who they always were, to an even greater degree? We may grow both more loving and more neurotic. We may grow more knowledgeable and more petty. The closest he gets to this is when he quotes the late Stephen Hawking who said, ""We only have to look at ourselves to see how intelligent life might develop into something we wouldn't want to meet."" In my own faith tradition, we believe that it is a severe mercy of God that flawed and fallen people don't live endlessly in our bodies and that hope is found not in endless mortal life, but life everlasting beyond bodily death.Finally, I am troubled with the hubristic strains that carry as much attraction for many contemporary hearers as they did for the first couple in the garden, and the tower builders of Babel. Kaku writes:...our destiny is to become the gods we once feared and worshipped. Science will give us the means by which we can shape the universe in our image. The question is whether we will have the wisdom of Solomon to accompany this vast celestial power. (p. 14)""You shall be as gods"" has been a temptation from the very beginning, and is one this book proffers to its readers. Along with that temptation comes tower-building (or space elevator) projects that reflect our pitiful efforts to offset our creaturely vulnerabilities. Will we exchange dependence on the sustenance of the Creator and responsible care for the world we've been given for anxious and costly efforts to preserve ourselves in other worlds, and perhaps neglect the most vulnerable on our own planet? I find the reference to Solomon fascinating, because the record tells us that, while wise, he abandoned the fear of God which is the beginning of wisdom, giving himself to building projects that taxed and enslaved, and that he multiplied wives and experiences. If Ecclesiastes gives us the final verdict on this project, it is all summed up as ""meaningless,"" ""a chasing after the wind,"" and that ""with much wisdom comes much sorrow."" It seems that this is what always comes of trying to make ourselves gods, and trying to stave off death when a universe of wonder and a world of beauty to be cared for beckons us to trust its Maker."

The first and foremost thought I had while reading this book was how shockingly poor my knowledge in astronomy was. The book covers a vast variety of concepts pertaining to universe, space travel, relativity, quantum theory, time travel and other likes written in a lucid fashion."
202,0241304849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1639329-erik,2,"A mile wide, an inch deep. It's simple to the point of being erroneous: He'll spend a single sentence glossing over a profound problem that'll take billions of manhours to resolve. Not to mention some truly stupid claims in here, such as his belief that only human beings (as opposed to other animals) possess an awareness of time. That's incorrect by inspection.And worse - it's boring. It feels less like ""The Future of Humanity"" and more like ""Cliffnotes of the Future of Humanity."" You would be vastly better served reading a science fiction book that explores these ideas of interstellar travel, generation arks, AI, etc. The Martian; The Expanse; etc, etc.BUT one major positive is just how much research this book inspired me into. It has a lot of references to real and underway projects. Following up on these was both fun and informative."
203,0241304849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22189980-belhor,3,"Interesting enough. Kaku is easy to read and I love the fact that he always quotes lots of interesting people in his writing. This book is the second book from Kaku that I've read, and even though I liked his ""Parallel Worlds"" more, this one is also a pretty decent book. I would have liked if he went through a little more details specially in the first chapters. The book gets better when you are almost halfway through."
204,0241304849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21091961-jacques-bezuidenhout,3,"Nice, easy to follow explanation of scientific concepts, and how humans are likely to evolve in future.I might have given the book a higher rating if I didn't already touch on most of the concepts discussed in other books:The Space Barons: Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, and the Quest to Colonize the CosmosHomo Deus: A Brief History of TomorrowA Short History of Nearly EverythingThere is quite a bit of overlap.This book is a nice summary putting the relevant information together and sequencing them chronologically.This book is also fairly new. So some of the facts contained goes up to things happening in 2017, which is nice.The latter part of the book touching on quantum and string theory, starts going over one's head a bit. Although explained as simple as possible, it does become a bit difficult to follow in audio format. You also need to be really open minded to get your head around some of the concepts / possibilities presented for the future. Since most are speculative, and mostly relies on things humans aren't even close to achieving."
205,0241304849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/93786551-nirali-lakdawala,4,"Its an amazing book and it takes you to space and beyond. The concepts are well explained & the way michio kaku talks about universe, the different ways to travel distance and the way we as a civilization will evolve is just superb."
206,0241304849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60980219-catherine-cole,5,"Although scientists might think the explanations given to the topics in this book may be a little too ""dumbed-down"" for their liking, they must remember that this book is for general audiences, who may not have the same knowledge or vocabulary as they do, therefore, simple explanations and comparisons to situations the non-scientific population can understand are necessary.This book takes you on a journey from the very first notions of rockets to hypothetic scenarios where you can transport your consciousness in laser beams to planets beyond our galaxy, and even escape the end of this universe.Many fascinating theories for space travel, building stations and ports in moons and asteroids, modifying our bodies to adapt to a non-planetary existence, and the different types of civilizations we might become, make this an eye/mind-opening read. Plus, it is a treasure chest of ideas for science fiction writers, who do not have the limitations of time or budget to make new realities come true on a page."
207,0241304849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73029907-cav,5,"This was an exceptionally well-formatted and written book. I really enjoyed it. This is my first from author Michio Kaku, but won't be my last.Kaku writes with a very engaging style, that holds the reader's attention effortlessly. This is a welcome change to many, many other science books I have read that are plagued by long-winded, esoteric and dry writing.The book is written in an easy-to-follow manner that would be suitable for the layperson who may be not too familiar with science. Kaku is an extremely effective science communicator; he takes complicated ideas, and conveys them in a simple and easy to understand manner. We need many more like him, IMHO.As mentioned, the book's formatting is excellent, as well. It is broken down into 3 main parts:
1) LEAVING THE EARTH2) VOYAGE TO THE STARS3) LIFE IN THE UNIVERSE
Which then break further down into different chapters. Kaku ends most chapters with a really natural segway to the upcoming one. The book has an excellent flow to it.If you were a fan of sci-fi as a kid, or are curious about what the future has in store for the human race, then this book is for you. The Future of Humanity covers (among many others): *The history of rockets; pioneers Goddard and von Braun.*Missions to the moon and Mars; the possibilities of living on either.*The asteroid belt, and possibilities of mining them.*The gas giants, Venus, Titan, and other moons.*Robotics, AI, and self-replicating robots.*Transhumanism*Spaceships; different theoretical technologies, and rocket types.*Black holes, wormholes, and spacetime.*The possibility of life on other worlds.*String theory and multiverses.I thoroughly enjoyed this book, and would most definitely recommend it to anyone interested in astronomy, physics, and the future of humanity in general. It is a big-picture book, with many incredible ideas that are sure to capture your imagination.5 stars, and a spot on my ""Favorites"" shelf."
208,0241304849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25338445-angie-reisetter,3,"Kaku is a great tour guide to the possibilities of the distant future. He imagines what may be possible, or at least what is not ruled out by the laws of physics as we know them. He has the tendency in this book, as he does in his others, to introduce topics with words like ""perhaps"" and ""might"", and then to drop them altogether, so that it sounds like he is telling us what will happen, casting aside minor difficulties like cost and human will. He threads science fiction references throughout his narrative, almost organizing his argument by what he's seen/read in science fiction. That's not a terrible way to go, but he also blurs the line of reality there, asking himself how we reconcile two different views of the future, as if they are not fictional and must be reconciled. The whole thing is very entertaining. But he has a theorist's tendency to discount reality, which is always my criticism of his work. But I did come back for more, and his work is always worth reading. A little inspiration is called for right about now.There seem to be a number of science futures becoming available in the near future, and I've recently read Soonish: Ten Emerging Technologies That'll Improve and/or Ruin Everything, which is very different from this one. I recommend them both as a study in contrasts: Kaku's extends to the limits of what might be possible one day maybe, and Soonish tries to keep it, well, soonish, in the realm of the reasonably possible. They have some topics in common, but they diverge rather dramatically.I got a copy to review from Net Galley."
209,0241304849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1667021-may-ling,5,"Summary: Well-Researched almost status update on where we are in creating the future a la sciene fiction.Short Vlog found at Instagram: WhereIsmayLing Youtube: Diary of a Speed Reader . I'd love it if you'd check me out and consider following/subscribing.You know, there is a crazy need that people have to judge a book by its title. It almost never is the case that that is what a book is on about. Perhaps a more accurate title would be: This is what Star Trek envisions and here's the status on where we're at. In that case, the book is amazing b/c it's quite hard to get that accomplished. If you look at the sea of references in the back and also read it, you'll realize how difficult it was to write something that is this comprehensive, albiet, much of detais of his reference are in the footnotes. p. 2 - He talks about the similarities between humans vs. chimps as a cohort a supposes that some cataclysmic event took out the genetic diversity that once was.p. 20 ""The amount of fuel you need reises exponentially with the change in velocity so that enormous amounts of fuel are needed to give an extra boost to speed."" (ok, a little wordy. What he's saying is it's hard to increasingly acceleration (that's what change in velocity is). You're going to need to accellorate for a while and at a crazy high speed if you want to leave earth for another planet. They are pretty far away.p. 32 - He deals with some of the politics and economics. He talks about it being easier to fund a person going into space vs program itself. As a result, many compromises (as that's more expensive to support life vs. just do unmanned missions).p. 33 - ""It takes $10k to put a pound of anything up in space.""p. 34 - The story of the great imperial fleet of Admiral Zheng 1405 - 1433. I really want to look thi up, b/c this was a big deal as relates to why there are Chinese people in specific places on the earth like Madagascar. Glad to finally get a citation. p. 40 Jules Verne's method of shooting someone to the moon predates rocket fuel. That's a major innovation. Blue Origin - company by Bezo's rocket system is called New ShepardElon Musk's Space X is called Falcon Rocket.p. 41Blue origin is billing it as a tourism voyage with an orientation.p. 43 Beso's vision: ""The whole idea is to perserve the Earth... The goal [is] to be able to evacuate humans. The planet would become a park."" All the waste would be ejected into space. In 2017 he announced his plans: ""Once considered a lonely outpost in space, the moon would become a bustling industrial and commercial hub with permanent manned bases and manufacturing."" p. 44 Moon Express plans on mining the moon.p. 45 The outer space treaty does not contain any language related to real estate ownership of the moon and it's annoying to many people to think of it.p. 47 - The book moves into the other tech that has to exist if you're legit going to go the moon. The first has to do with medical care. Robots need to get better for things like remote-controlled surgery. Similarly a lot more work has to go in withstanding radiation.p. 50 Talks about how the moon was formed through a huge impact billions of years ago. The Earth looked like packman and the Moon a slice. All that changed through gravity.p. 62 - Musk's company's vision to Mars...he's on track to try to send a manned mission to mars by 2024. Typically estimates have said it would cost betwen $400-500b. He's trying to do it for $10bln. He's trying to get the price down per ride to $200k so that it competes with Virgin's galactic SpaceShipTwo. There's also pricing for the Russian rocket International Space Station which is $20-40m. I never knew the price of this stuff. Nice.p. 67 The total failure (which is always fatal) of going into space is about 1.5% (3 failures out of 135) with the fatality count being about 3.3%. With mars, most satellites do not make it there (3/4ths do not).p. 85 - MDRS Mars Desert Research station attempts to make realistic situations to determine the psychological effects of being on MARS.p. 87 - Terraforming in terms of DNA. There is an idea that DNA came from Mars and transformed the earth. p. 93 - They believe that MARS lost its magnetic field (necessary to protect the planet) from heavy bombardment. It's why the core is solid vs. lava like ours.p. 94 - ""The Earth is larger than Mars, so it did not coll down as quickly. The Earth also did not suffer a collapse of its magnetic field caused by giant meteor impacts."" p. 99 - Some people want to break off a piece of Europa and bring it to mars to repopulate the planet with water.p. 103 - Titan has atmosphere and would actually support life, though we'd stll need a few other things. p. 116 - The use of AI to help explore the planets in preparation for human entrance. Or alternatively,we just move our organic body into a computer one so we can enjoy space travel.p. 118 - He introduces Neural Networks p. 121 - Self-replicating robots are necessary in space. this describes what they have to be like.p. 129 He has a theory that humans differ from animals b/c we notice time. I'm not 100% sure I agree. but ok.p. 156 HE talks about the challenge of stopping a rocket ship.p. 158 The space elevator is another option often tossed around.p. 169 Parallax. didn't know that word.p. 170 - Talks about how we find planets with minor dimming of light.p. 178 talks about rogue planets.p. 190 sets up for the idea that medical drives the ability of humans to expand into new territories.Solving aging (telemeers) is about allowing us to go to space.p. 204 Again putting you in a robot might work.p. 206 - They talk about the exoskeleton and where that's at.p. 211 - The chip in glasses to type out a sentence is early stage communication via just neural activity.p. 226- What if alliens are WAY ahead of us? p. 233 - It almost goes backward in talking about what makes Humans the best on earth. It's not b/c we are strong We are actually worthless in strengh and other characteristics.p. 248 A dyson sphere is created around a star to harness the energy that comes off of it.p. 258 They are looking for someone that has done this in the galaxy to see if some other species has left a big footprint like we have on earth. So far, no luck.p. 261 Talks about how DNA can demonstrate the rate of divergence/mutation. It's really slow. Weird would have thought it would be driven by the amount/speed of procreation. p. 323 A great reading list. I'd like to one day take a look at all of these books."
210,0241304849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/912138-alex-givant,5,Excellent book about what we need to do to leave Earth and spread between stars.
211,0241304849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/897-abe,4,"I enjoyed reading that book. While I don't agree with some of the author's views on the future of humanity, the book is very well written in an engaging style. I am now excited to dig more into string theory and super symmetry. "
212,0241304849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22443749-debbie,4,"4.5 starsThe Future of Humanity is a fascinating piece of speculative astrophysics and science which seeks to explore the various ways humanity may expand our civilization across the universe. I thoroughly enjoyed how in depth Kaku got, not just laying out the potential opportunities but also fully explaining the science behind the theories. Despite this heavily scientific approach, this book never felt boring or overwhelming. Even if some of the topics were a little far-fetched, it was nevertheless an intriguing and engaging read.—75,000 years ago there was a major volcanic eruption (Topa); considered the biggest eruption in the past 25 million years. Some scientists speculate only 2,000 humans remained and had to repopulate, which is why DNA between people even if they’re not related is surprisingly similarWhen you consider every single creature that has ever lived on the earth such as amoebas, plants, dinosaurs etc., you find that 99.9% have gone extinct, meaning the creatures and living things that are alive today are an extremely small sliver of all the living things that have ever lived on the planetOur earth has gone through 5 major extinction cycles in our history, in which up to 90% of the living species went extinct at a timeBecause our galaxy has 100 billion stars there may be as many as 20 billion Earth sized planets in the Milky Way galaxy. it’s estimated there is 2 billion trillion earth sized planets in the visible universe including galaxies outside our ownThere is actually gravity in space and the feeling/illusion of weightlessness is because everything falls at the same rate so astronauts are falling at the same rate as the spaceshipIn the future, we may use the moon as a gas station, because ice at the South Pole can be used to farm oxygen and hydrogen which are primary components of rocket fuel, and also rare earth metals found there as well which are also able to be made into fuel. Helium 3 is also expected to be on the moon, which can be used for Fusion reactors. There is also talk of finding platinum. All this raises the question of whether it’s legal to mine on the moon and if so who can stake a claim on itIf we built a living space on the moon, at first it would need to be sent supplies from Earth every few weeks. The astronauts could use Internet, cell phones etc. as normal once they set up the proper technology because the delay between earth and the moon is only one second. They could potentially farm oxygen from the soil and water from the ice caps. The bases may be built underground to protect from solar radiation. There will need to be large amounts of solar panels because a moon day lasts an Earth month, so there are 2 weeks of day followed by 2 weeks of nightYour blood boils in the vacuum of space because as pressure drops the boiling point of water also dropsAstroids contain iron, nickel, carbon & cobalt, as well as significant quantities of rare earth metals and valuable metals including irradium, platinum, and rodium. It is believed that we will eventually mine the astroid belt, and many entrepreneurs have already expressed interest in finding ways to do so. 12 astroids have already been identified as key targets for mining, because only a slight nudge to their orbit would bring them closer towards earth and the moon and able to enter into orbit, making mining them much more efficientElon musk‘s goal with space X is to reduce the cost of commercial space travel by 10x. He was the 1st to invent a reusable booster capsule module rather than discarding it after use. His ultimate goal is to make it to Mars. His goal is to send a manned mission to Mars by 2024. He envisions eventually the cost of sending someone to Mars will be $200,000/person round-tripIt only takes 3?days to get to the moon but 9 months to get to Mars. A round trip to Mars would take 2 years. Potential dangers during this deep space trip include excessive exposure to radiation, damage to the ship from solar flares or micro astroids, muscular atrophy from being in reduced gravity so long, and psychological side effectsNASA plans on having a manned mission arrive at Mars by 2033; this plan involves creating a lunar space station from which ships could go to Mars, rather than going directly to Mars like space XLike the moon, explorers on Mars would be able to harvest water, oxygen, and hydrogen from the permafrost and ice to serve as sources for water, oxygen, and fuel. The days on Mars are similar in length to days on earth, but the temperature is extremely cold, barely above the freezing point of water during the day and dropping drastically at night. Like the moon, the gravity is less so explorers would have to exercise daily to avoid muscular atrophy and loss of bone density. Mars has both water ice caps and dry ice/CO2 ice caps. The water ice caps stay consistent year round, but the dry ice caps fluctuate with the seasons and mostly evaporate in the summerFor Mars to become truly habitable, we would need to find a way to slowly heat the atmosphere so liquid water could flow on the surface, allowing for plants to grow outside of contained greenhouses. Terraforming mars is probably centuries away, and may be prohibitively costly. To artificially raise the temperature of the planet, we may inject water vapor and methane into the atmosphere to create a greenhouse effect, or send satellites into orbit over the ice caps to direct concentrated sunlight towards the caps to cause them to melt and release water vapor. Eventually, this warming process would become self-sustaining as well as increase the atmospheric pressure of mars. As plants grow and proliferate, dying plants will enrich the soil, and growing plants will add oxygen to the atmosphereMars cooled down slower than Earth did. Mars no longer has a molten core but rather a solid rock core, so it doesn’t have a magnetic field. This is one of the factors that accelerated Mars’s atmosphere loss. Also, the carbon dioxide is mostly trapped in the ground instead of proliferating in the atmosphere, causing a reverse greenhouse effectSome of the moons of the gas giants are also viewed as potential candidates for human coloniesThe gas giants are theorized to have a thick gaseous atmosphere, a cold liquid hydrogen ocean around the entire planet, and a small, solid hydrogen core because of the extreme pressures. Jupiter is surrounded by radiation, which causes Radio interference. The gravity of Jupiter actually helps protect the earth from being bombarded by astroids because it essentially serves as a vacuum cleanerTitan (a moon of Saturn) is a potential candidate for human colonization, but because it’s so far away it can’t have self-sustaining greenhouse effect, and the lakes of ethane Could combust if it got too hot. But it could be a source of fuel. And it’s one of the few places in our solar system where we would be able to go outside without a spacesuit because it has enough of an atmosphere that our blood wouldn’t boil/we wouldn’t be crushed (we’d still need an oxygen mask). Europa (a moon of Jupiter) has potential for microbial life in its ocean (which sits under the layer of ice that encircles the moon, and was made possible because of friction caused from the extreme tidal forces caused by Jupiter’s gravity)All the gas giants have rings, which are likely caused by moons that got too close to the planet being torn apart by the planet’s gravityTitan and the Kuiper belt would most likely serve as refueling stations or points from which to jump to the next star or planetGraphene/carbon nanotubes will likely be the material used to make infrastructure on other planets, because it’s immensely strong yet incredibly light. We’re not at a point yet where we can mass produce it, because even a small impurity can ruin it, but once we have the technology to do so, it’ll be the best material to use. It could even be used to create skin-tight, lightweight spacesuitsFor Interstellar and planetary colonization to be realistic, we would need automatons—robots with more intelligence than our current ones who can perform a wide variety of tasks such as building cities on planets and moons, which would be easier for a robot (doesn’t need a spacesuit, doesn’t get affected by radiation, isn’t limited by oxygen supply, etc)Getting robots to understand common sense has been extremely difficult and currently prevents them from fully perceiving and navigating the world. Currently robots need human intervention to do most tasks. Modern robots will likely be a combination of top down and bottom up learning; they will have some information already integrated into their systems but they will also have neural networks that will allow them to learn from repetition and gain common sense. Robots would also need to be self replicatingIon engines may make it possible for the trip to Mars to take 40 days rather than 9 monthsPotential energy sources for traveling at the speed of light include light sailing (propelling with lasers), nuclear energy (propelling with nuclear explosions), and antimatter energy. an antimatter rocket would have 100% energy efficiency, whereas nuclear explosion only has 1% because most of the Energy is wasted. However only a very small amount of anti-matter exists naturally, so we would have to manufacture it (currently extremely expensive). Storing the antimatter would be difficult because it would have to be stored in a trap that suspends it in a magnetic field so it’s not able to touch the edges of the container; if it touch the edges it would destroy the containerSomething that would help make getting materials into space much easier and more economical is creating a space elevator that stretches from the surface of the earth out above our atmosphere. Scientists predict that it is theoretically possible to do so, possibly even by 2035, but we would need to find a way to make enough strong enough Materials for this to be feasible. Ideally pure carbon nanotubes would be used, but right now it would be difficult to make as much as would be neededTo travel faster than light at warp speed, we need to find a way to make vast quantities of negative matter or negative energy. We’ve been able to make small amounts of negative energy, but we are nowhere close to producing the amount needed to even consider developing warp drivesSuspended animation/cryogenic freezing to allow longer voyages without needing generations of people to live on a spaceship is currently not possible. While other animals are able to survive in suspended animation because of the levels of glucose in their blood which prevents their blood from freezing, the amount of sugar needed is too high for humansTelomeres are part of our chromosomes that get shorter with aging; when they get too short the cells can no longer divide. If we can prevent that shortening from happening, it would increase our life span because our cells would be able to divide and replicate themselves longer. However, cancer operates in the same way and is essentially immortal, so that would be a riskIf we were able to identify exactly what parts of our genetic make up contribute to aging, we could alter our genes to expand our life expectancyAging is thought to be the accumulation of errors in our genetic make up over time, so if we can prevent those errors from happening because of deteriorating cell replication then we can slow down the aging processIf we were able to somehow make ourselves inmortal, or drastically increase our life expectancy, then we would likely have to deal with extreme overpopulation eventually. Before the Industrial Revolution, the human population of the earth was 300 million or less. It has now grown to 7.5 billion and is anticipated to increase by 1 billion every 12 years. It is estimated that there will be 11.2 billion people on the earth by 2100. However, others argued that our increase in population is slowly going down and will stabilize before we reach a level of overpopulationA primate has never been cloned. If we come to the point where human cloning is possible, it is likely that only a small percentage of the population would do so. It is also speculated that eventually we will find ways to modify our genes or enhance our bodies through cybernetics, but we will likely not take it so far that we drastically modify our appearance. Modifications would likely be improvements to existing issues (ex: eyesight) or ways to improve our social standing, rather than becoming creatures with giant heads and huge eyes and skinny bodies. Our use of cybernetics would prevent us from evolving that drastically. If we were to disperse in colonies across the galaxy, our genetic makeup would remain within 0.1% difference between colonies (same as between humans currently)We may in the next century or so develop ways to laser port our consciousness across the galaxy so our physical bodies could remain in place while our consciousness is able to move at the speed of light to visit other places by being ported it into an avatarEarth like planets need to be accompanied by large gaseous Jupiter like planets to clear out incoming astroids. They also need to be accompanied by a larger moon to stabilize their spin and trajectoryThe drake equation attempts to estimate the probability that we will make contact with intelligent life forms; however there is still a lot of unknowns that prevent us from having an accurate assessment from this equationIf there are intelligent beings on other planets, we can’t assume that they communicate vocally the same way we do. They might communicate through pheromones like bugs, or sonar like batsIntelligent life will likely follow the laws of evolution. An intelligent species will likely be descended from predators, so it will have forward facing eyes. They will also likely have opposable thumbs or some type of grasping appendage. They will also have some form of languageKardishev scale of civilizations: A type 1 civilization (planetary) uses all the energy of the sunlight that falls on the planet. Type 2 civilization (stellar) uses all the energy it’s sun produces. A type 3 civilization (galactic) uses the energy of an entire galaxy. We are currently a type 0.7 civilization because we’re not using the full energy of all the sunlight shining on our planet. We are about a century or two away from becoming a full type 1, and possibly A few thousand years from becoming a type 2. We might not become type 3 for 100,000 years or even up to 1 million because it requires a level of interstellar travel that we’re nowhere close to having. The energy measurements for each type just means and equivalent amount of energy, it doesn’t mean you have to be getting all your energy from the sun. Each next level of civilization is between 10 to 100 billion times more powerful than the previous typeA civilization that has reached type 2 is likely nearly immortal, and most of its energy generating machinery will likely be placed off planet because there will be so much energy being produced that it creates too much heat for the planet to be habitable. They will likely also harvest energy from their sun through a Dyson sphere and because of the vast quantities they are harvesting Will emit infrared radiationThere is another scale of civilization that is calculated based on the amount of information it consumes as proposed by Carl Sagan. Type A civilization consumes 1,000,000 bits of information. Type Z civilization consumes a 10^31 bits of information. We are a type H civilization. By this scale a type two civilization would be able to consume energy through widely distributed Dyson sphere, harvesting from astroids, developing super efficient nano technology, etc. and avoid giving up the levels of infrared radiation that would make it detectable to usOur first encounter with alien civilization will likely be a robotic self replicating probeString theory exists in 10 dimensions. It cancels out quantum corrections, basically meaning it cancels out the fact that quantum things like electrons and protons are able to be in multiple places at once. This quantum cancellation can only happen in 10 dimensions. The pairing for particles in string theory is sparticles, quarks are squarks, etc. String theory assumes an infinite number of universes (Multiverse). String theory says the universe was originally 10 dimensions, then for some reason the other 6 dimensions “curled up” leaving us with only 4 perceivable dimensionsDark matter was discovered because astrophysicist realized that the Milky Way was spinning 10 times faster than Newtonian physics would allow without flying apart, so they realize there must be some invisible thing adding all that extra mass to the galaxy. Dark matter is invisible, but it bends starlight so we’re able to detect it that way. Dark matter has gravity, but can’t be held/interact with matter in any way. It’s electrically neutral and only interacts with gravity. However we’ve never been able to officially prove that dark matter exist yet or create it ourselves in any way. Once we do, it will prove string theoryString theory is the only way would be able to do calculations about the quantum corrections needed for time travel, going through a wormhole, faster than light travel, etcThe universe is expected to eventually end in 1 of 3 ways: the big crunch, the big freeze, or the big rip. The big crunch is when the expansion of the universe slow down, stops, and reverses itself, eventually coalescing in a giant wad of superheated matter and possibly eventually turning into another big bang. For the big freeze, by the laws of entropy eventually the stars will stop shining, the sky will go black and temperature will reach absolute zero wherein matter nearly ceases to move. The big rip refers to the fact that the universe is exponentially expanding far faster than anticipated, and that distant galaxies will eventually speed away from us faster than the speed of light and disappear. Eventually our galaxy and solar system would be torn apart from this rapid expansion. The universe would end in an explosion, a singularity of infinite energyOur sun will exhaust its energy in about 5 billion years; it will expand into a red giant star which will essentially set the earth on fire, mountains will melt, oceans will boil, and the earth will be engulfed. After this, the sun will exhaust all its nuclear fuel and shrink and go cold as a white dwarf and then die as a dark dwarf star. In 4.8 billion years, the Milky Way and Andromeda galaxy’s will collide. There are two black holes will collide and merge and a new galaxy will eventually be formedDark energy is the energy of a vacuum. It acts like antigravity, and it pushes the universe apart. It is different than dark matter. The more the universe expands, the more dark energy there is, which makes the universe expand faster. About 69% of the matter/energy in the universe is contained in dark energy. Dark matter makes up 26%. Atoms of hydrogen and helium make up about 5%. And other higher elements that make up the earth, our bodies, etc. only make up 0.5%A possible way to overcome the eventual death of our universe is by becoming a type 4 civilization that harnesses extragalactic energy like dark energy and is able to reverse the big rip by creating a sphere in which dark energy reverses polarity so that inside the sphere The galaxies continue to survive normally while outside the sphere the universe is continuing to expand rapidly and tear itself apart. Another possible solution is that we find a way to leave our universe and go to one of the other theoretical bubble universes in the Multiverse. They could use negative energy to create a wormhole. The bubble universes are floating in a 10 dimensional arena—Read for the Astronomy prompt for the 2019 OWLs Readathon"

The second reason for listening twice is that it is chock full of info that is easy to miss in an audio format - so I also downloaded the Kindle version...I love Michio Kaku’s books. This one is about fun science of the future. Space travel - where are we, what do we still need to do, where would we go, how would we need to alter ourselves for outer space, what spacecrafts would we use, etc. Fun stuff, all told in an approachable, interesting story format. Kaku loves science fiction and peppers the narrative with movie and book references. Interestingly enough, he judges most of it more science and less fiction. Kaku is a physics professor, thus the physics are very solid; but I have my doubts on some of the biotechnology parts. Nevertheless, a thoroughly enjoyable book that I ended up listening to within about a day."
214,0241304849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8686546-feyzan---the-raven-boy,3,"3.5 starsthe journey of a thousand miles begins with the first stepI don't know what I was thinking when I picked this book up. I don't usually like to read books that are dense with physics and cosmology, but I admire michio kaku so i had to give this one a try. I am not surprised to feel disappointed, however. This book was pretty good on entertainment, and I understand why nerds would love it, but it did nothing for me, except maybe entertain a little. I couldn't take this book seriously as it was brimming with speculations about things that may or may not happen in next 5 billion years. I mean instead of worrying about what will happen in 5 billion years shouldn't we focus on saving our planet from all the man made chaos?I enjoyed the science fiction elements and reading about how tenaciously scientists are trying to make science fiction a new reality for humanity. It was all very interesting to read. The book covered many topics like terraforming, multi-verse, robotics, transhumanism. All these heavy and dense topic were easier to grasp and understand thanks to michio kaku's writing style and movie references. It feels like a new war is in order between the richest people of the world as they compete to colonize Mars and the universe itself. I think these rich people, Instead of spending billions of dollars on space exploration and planning to colonize other planets, should spend some of their foturne and influence to make this planet safe for everyone, Just saying. When I was a kid I used to dream about meeting aliens, going on a mission to space and whatnot. My imaginations used to very elaborated,  I used to imagine alines and robots in a very fanciful way. Robots used to have chips inside of them that could shut them off, if they tried to take over the world. Then I grew up. However, reading this book made me realize that some people are incapable of growing up.
 When self-aware robots do arrive, we must add a fail-safe chip that will shut them off if they have murderous thoughts.
I mean, first of all, no self aware robot is arriving anytime soon. Second of all, no self-aware robot will insert a chip inside of itself (I forgot to mention these robots are supposed to be self-replicating too.) Anyway, you get the idea this book is high on speculation and overflowing with head-scratching logic.
In 2017, a controversy arose between two billionaires, Mark Zuckerberg, founder of Facebook, and Elon Musk of SpaceX and Tesla. Zuckerberg maintained that artificial intelligence was a great generator of wealth and prosperity that will enrich all of society. Musk, however, took a much darker view and stated that AI actually posed an existential risk to all of humanity, that one day our creations may turn on us.
Wow, this exactly what we needed to be discussing right now. 🙄 Zuckerbergs' first concern should be to be make Facebook safe and secure again, not this. And then this book celebrate psychotic maniacs and call them heroes. 
 He confided to me that he takes several hundred pills a day, anticipating his own immortality
I guess, this book isn't meant to be taken seriously. It's just good to get inside the heads of scientists and learn how they operate and how they see the future. This book has imbued me with unnecessary knowledge that I don't know where and how to use. This knowledge is increasing my, already soaring, existential angst that wont rest until I use this knowledge somewhere. Anyway, this book isn't bad. It just wasn't for me. I am sure nerds and Sci-fi fans will love it."

Kaku addresses the possibilities of setting up permanent bases on the moon and terraforming Mars. At some point, humanity will need to move beyond the solar system to settle planets revolving around nearby stars. He also addresses genetic changes people may undergo, how humans will begin to merge with AI/machines, and ways immortality may become possible.

It really normalizes the thoughts of leaving Earth and not only exploring beyond, but settling beyond. Even crazier notions of removing our minds from our bodies to travel via laser beams to the exterior of our galaxy into exoskeletons waiting for us is explored. And logically. I recommend this book just for the sake of expanding your thoughts on outer space and the future of where humankind may end up."

Off course It was a pleasant experience because it get me acquainted with a world which I was unfamiliar with. Reading "" The future of humanity"", I thought about many serious subjects and my mind was blowing up with interesting informations about almost everything. From space to physics theories, everything was explained in simple words and that was the beauty of this book. Reading this book gives you a clear insight about the future of us as humans and discusses several probable possibilities in the long life span of humankind during his/her adventure in the space. I recommend those who are new to this genre, to read this work as their first experience, and I promise that it will be their best first experience!📚😊"
219,0241304849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7258380-dan-graser,4,"In his latest work, physicist Michio Kaku has focused on the what the future life of humanity might be as pertains to several possible scenarios. Throughout the work he mostly does a decent job of suggesting how plausible these ideas are, or at the very least, the type of timeframe needed to develop the requisite technological capabilities to achieve them. Beginning with the colonization of Mars, Kaku does a fine job of explaining just how this very popular notion would have to work, the costs involved, where our current capabilities stand, and just who is at the forefront of this quest. As NASA continues to be underfunded, though they do have a Mars program in operation, private funding has taken over much of this territory and the competition created by these developments is changing just how (some, particularly wealthy) humans may leave this planet for good.Next Kaku takes up the idea of interstellar travel. This is one area where the type of technology required is hundreds of years away. This distances to other star systems is staggering, our technology still primitive, and the pace at which we could develop any sort of device traveling remotely close to the speed of light is very difficult to predict. Some hugely interesting ideas are posited but he is quick to note that many of these are at the moment very unrealistic.The intersection of AI and humanity is discussed but not in particularly great detail. I would recommend Max Tegmark on this subject as his picture is a bit more complete. Anyone who has read the literature on this likely already has a more thorough understanding than is presented in this section.Finally and perhaps most significantly, Kaku details what physics tells us about the end of space and time and the possibility to forestall these dire (though billions of years in the future) events with technology developed to harness the gravitational effect of dark matter and dark energy. As we still have no idea as to the workings of either of these this is of course purely speculative but this is the first I've heard of these compelling ideas. As with all of his books, Kaku is an engaging and accessible writer that only occasionally veers into oversimplification or inclusion of ideas purely for their mass appeal, not for their plausibility. This is an effective summary of where we are as pertains to the possible routes humanity might take to ensure, at the level of our entire species, our survival. Wonderful reading all around."

Unlike pessimists like Harari who fear human life becoming meaningless by advances in AI, he imagines using progresses in technology to settle and terraform Mars and elsewhere ! The first section which focuses on near future technologies and space travel was an absolute delight.Also, his vision is not limited to the next decade or 20 years, he also talks about possibilities in the next 100 and 1000 years and even later. Except for the last chapters on wormholes and time-travel which felt weird, enjoyed this joyride. A bit like a spiritual guru the author was expanding my mind’s horizons with his thought-experiments.Will be reading more by this author."

"
223,0241304849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2433243-ayami,4,"Michio Kaku talks about a lot of interesting concepts regarding technology, space exploration and science. It wasn’t a mind-blowing read, though, as the majority of what he talks about has been mentioned in plenty of other non-fiction books out there. However, I won’t penalize the book for introducing themes I happened to be already familiar with. Some physics stuff I found hard to follow but this could be due to the fact, I was listening to it as an audiobook. Some reviewers complained about the onslaught of the pop culture references but I enjoyed them and think they were pretty well incorporated into the text.

Topics range from propulsion systems to AI and biological enhancements. While a number of the author's ideas are not particularly convincing, virtually all are interesting."
230,0241304849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6991670-bob,4,"Summary: An exploration of the possibility and necessity of humanity becoming a multi-planetary species, and the revolutions of technology necessary to realize that future.Michio Kaku is a theoretical theorist studying string theory at the City University of New York, and the author of a series of best-selling futurist works based on his knowledge of physics and other fields. He is also a riveting, passionate speaker who believes, along with others like Elon Musk, that we must envision becoming a multi-planetary species. This, the latest of his books, explores that idea, it's necessity, and the technological advances that could make this possible.Kaku argument for the necessity of becoming a multi-planetary species is rooted in the priority of the survival of the human species. He is convinced that, whether through physical causes ranging from cataclysmic volcanoes to asteroids or the final death throes of the sun, our planet will become unlivable for human beings--if we do not accomplish this first through human causation as in nuclear holocaust or global warming. Discussing other great challenges we've faced through history, he writes:But now we face perhaps the greatest challenge of all: to leave the confines of the Earth and soar into outer space. The laws of physics are clear; sooner or later we will face global crises that threaten our very existence. (p.6)In three parts he explores the technologies that can make this possible. The first part explores interplanetary settlement efforts within our solar system, using moon as a base, and Mars as our first settlement, and later possibly settling, or exploiting the resources of the large moons orbiting the gas giants of Jupiter and Saturn. He describes existing efforts by public and private enterprise to return to the moon and create settlements on Mars. This itself is formidable considering exposures to radioactivity and the inhospitable nature of the planet but he argues for the eventual possibility of terra-forming Mars, making it livable and life sustaining. What is fascinating is that much of this is possible by applying and extending our current technology, albeit at great cost.The second part of the book seemed like something out of Star Trek, exploring the technologies of interstellar travel. All of this is beyond our current technologies. As a physicist, he takes us on a tour of possible technologies from nanoships and laser and solar sail propelled vehicles, to ramjet fusion and antimatter engines, and proposes that the warp drive of The Enterprise is possible, and consists not in propelling one faster than light, but literally warping space so that a vessel is pulled through it at hyper light speeds. Nearly all of this requires inordinately great quantities of energy, and presupposes a level of civilization at which we harness, first the energies of the sun, and than galactic levels of energy. This will allow us to explore at least the nearby stars or further into a galaxy of stars where it is increasingly evident that there are many possible habitable planets.The third part explores the reality that the great distances to be traveled, even should we exceed the speed of light, either require multi-generational crews, or advances toward immortality. He explores research on curing aging, on trans-humanism in which humans and machines become increasingly integrated. He discusses the Human Connectome Project, in which human neural networks are mapped, digitized, and potentially could be reproduced light years away, transmitted via laser networks. He also speculates on the existence of other more advanced civilizations. He mentions observations of recurring drops in energy output of star KIC 8462852 by as much as 30 percent positing an object 22 times as large as Jupiter, speculating that one possibility would be a megastructure like a Dyson sphere constructed by an alien civilization.This part also gets into Kaku's area of theoretical physics, string theory, as he explores the possibility of travel through wormholes and stargates and perhaps even escaping the present universe into one of many multiverses, particularly useful when this one burns out.Whew! Kaku's tour of the technologies necessary for interstellar travel is both breathtaking, and staggering. On one hand, much of the technology we use today, even that I am using as I write, was science fiction in my childhood. It is always dangerous to scoff at what seems impossible. The cell phone at my side represents applications of theoretical physics unknown 150 years ago in terms of the miniaturized circuitry and memory, cellular and wi-fi capabilities, GPS tracking, and touch screens. What would have been an object of wonder 150 years ago is now a commonplace of many of our lives. Yet what Kaku describes in this book, particularly in parts two and three, strings together ventures of immense cost, requiring unimaginable amounts of power, huge quantities of rare (and dangerous) resources like anti-matter, as well as scenarios, the survivability of which are in question, all of which to preserve the human species on a multi-planetary scale. Of course Kaku allows millenia for reaching such capabilities.The most credible part of the book for me was the near-term ideas of travel to Mars, perhaps even establishing some form of outpost there. If something of a cataclysmic nature were to occur on Earth in the next couple centuries, such an outpost might preserve civilization, and even re-settle earth. Even this is tremendously costly as well as risky. We must expect lives to be lost, even as they were among other explorers and settlers throughout our history. But it also raised questions of several sorts.Some were questions of priority. Should we think of terra-forming Mars when our own planet's earth, water and air need so much attention? Should we pour huge funds and inordinate amounts of energy into space travel when transport on earth is still carbon-based and polluting? When we are not yet addressing preventable diseases of childhood, and providing quality and affordable health care on a global basis, is it right to pour huge amounts into life-extending technologies that may benefit a select few? Or even as we think about planetary defense, might we focus on technologies for detection and destruction of planet-threatening objects from outer space? All this falls under the question of caring for the planet and people that we have before we think about settling other worlds.Some are more fundamental questions having to do with whether we ought to do these things. I think of this particularly around the discussion of immortality. Kaku fails to deal with the issue of whether it is a good thing for humans with our flawed as well as noble nature to live for ever. Have you ever noticed how, as people age, they become who they always were, to an even greater degree? We may grow both more loving and more neurotic. We may grow more knowledgeable and more petty. The closest he gets to this is when he quotes the late Stephen Hawking who said, ""We only have to look at ourselves to see how intelligent life might develop into something we wouldn't want to meet."" In my own faith tradition, we believe that it is a severe mercy of God that flawed and fallen people don't live endlessly in our bodies and that hope is found not in endless mortal life, but life everlasting beyond bodily death.Finally, I am troubled with the hubristic strains that carry as much attraction for many contemporary hearers as they did for the first couple in the garden, and the tower builders of Babel. Kaku writes:...our destiny is to become the gods we once feared and worshipped. Science will give us the means by which we can shape the universe in our image. The question is whether we will have the wisdom of Solomon to accompany this vast celestial power. (p. 14)""You shall be as gods"" has been a temptation from the very beginning, and is one this book proffers to its readers. Along with that temptation comes tower-building (or space elevator) projects that reflect our pitiful efforts to offset our creaturely vulnerabilities. Will we exchange dependence on the sustenance of the Creator and responsible care for the world we've been given for anxious and costly efforts to preserve ourselves in other worlds, and perhaps neglect the most vulnerable on our own planet? I find the reference to Solomon fascinating, because the record tells us that, while wise, he abandoned the fear of God which is the beginning of wisdom, giving himself to building projects that taxed and enslaved, and that he multiplied wives and experiences. If Ecclesiastes gives us the final verdict on this project, it is all summed up as ""meaningless,"" ""a chasing after the wind,"" and that ""with much wisdom comes much sorrow."" It seems that this is what always comes of trying to make ourselves gods, and trying to stave off death when a universe of wonder and a world of beauty to be cared for beckons us to trust its Maker."

Not to mention some truly stupid claims in here, such as his belief that only human beings (as opposed to other animals) possess an awareness of time. That's incorrect by inspection.And worse - it's boring. It feels less like ""The Future of Humanity"" and more like ""Cliffnotes of the Future of Humanity."" You would be vastly better served reading a science fiction book that explores these ideas of interstellar travel, generation arks, AI, etc. The Martian; The Expanse; etc, etc.BUT one major positive is just how much research this book inspired me into.

So some of the facts contained goes up to things happening in 2017, which is nice.The latter part of the book touching on quantum and string theory, starts going over one's head a bit. Although explained as simple as possible, it does become a bit difficult to follow in audio format. You also need to be really open minded to get your head around some of the concepts / possibilities presented for the future.

This is my first from author Michio Kaku, but won't be my last.Kaku writes with a very engaging style, that holds the reader's attention effortlessly. This is a welcome change to many, many other science books I have read that are plagued by long-winded, esoteric and dry writing.The book is written in an easy-to-follow manner that would be suitable for the layperson who may be not too familiar with science. Kaku is an extremely effective science communicator; he takes complicated ideas, and conveys them in a simple and easy to understand manner. We need many more like him, IMHO.As mentioned, the book's formatting is excellent, as well. It is broken down into 3 main parts:
1) LEAVING THE EARTH2) VOYAGE TO THE STARS3) LIFE IN THE UNIVERSE
Which then break further down into different chapters. Kaku ends most chapters with a really natural segway to the upcoming one. The book has an excellent flow to it.If you were a fan of sci-fi as a kid, or are curious about what the future has in store for the human race, then this book is for you. The Future of Humanity covers (among many others): *The history of rockets; pioneers Goddard and von Braun.*Missions to the moon and Mars; the possibilities of living on either.*The asteroid belt, and possibilities of mining them.*The gas giants, Venus, Titan, and other moons.*Robotics, AI, and self-replicating robots.*Transhumanism*Spaceships; different theoretical technologies, and rocket types.*Black holes, wormholes, and spacetime.*The possibility of life on other worlds.*String theory and multiverses.I thoroughly enjoyed this book, and would most definitely recommend it to anyone interested in astronomy, physics, and the future of humanity in general. It is a big-picture book, with many incredible ideas that are sure to capture your imagination.5 stars, and a spot on my ""Favorites"" shelf."

He imagines what may be possible, or at least what is not ruled out by the laws of physics as we know them. He has the tendency in this book, as he does in his others, to introduce topics with words like ""perhaps"" and ""might"", and then to drop them altogether, so that it sounds like he is telling us what will happen, casting aside minor difficulties like cost and human will. He threads science fiction references throughout his narrative, almost organizing his argument by what he's seen/read in science fiction. That's not a terrible way to go, but he also blurs the line of reality there, asking himself how we reconcile two different views of the future, as if they are not fictional and must be reconciled. The whole thing is very entertaining. But he has a theorist's tendency to discount reality, which is always my criticism of his work. But I did come back for more, and his work is always worth reading. A little inspiration is called for right about now.There seem to be a number of science futures becoming available in the near future, and I've recently read Soonish: Ten Emerging Technologies That'll Improve and/or Ruin Everything, which is very different from this one. I recommend them both as a study in contrasts: Kaku's extends to the limits of what might be possible one day maybe, and Soonish tries to keep it, well, soonish, in the realm of the reasonably possible. They have some topics in common, but they diverge rather dramatically.I got a copy to review from Net Galley."
239,0241304849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1667021-may-ling,5,"Summary: Well-Researched almost status update on where we are in creating the future a la sciene fiction.Short Vlog found at Instagram: WhereIsmayLing Youtube: Diary of a Speed Reader . I'd love it if you'd check me out and consider following/subscribing.You know, there is a crazy need that people have to judge a book by its title. It almost never is the case that that is what a book is on about. Perhaps a more accurate title would be: This is what Star Trek envisions and here's the status on where we're at. In that case, the book is amazing b/c it's quite hard to get that accomplished. If you look at the sea of references in the back and also read it, you'll realize how difficult it was to write something that is this comprehensive, albiet, much of detais of his reference are in the footnotes. p. 2 - He talks about the similarities between humans vs. chimps as a cohort a supposes that some cataclysmic event took out the genetic diversity that once was.p. 20 ""The amount of fuel you need reises exponentially with the change in velocity so that enormous amounts of fuel are needed to give an extra boost to speed."" (ok, a little wordy. What he's saying is it's hard to increasingly acceleration (that's what change in velocity is). You're going to need to accellorate for a while and at a crazy high speed if you want to leave earth for another planet. They are pretty far away.p. 32 - He deals with some of the politics and economics. He talks about it being easier to fund a person going into space vs program itself. As a result, many compromises (as that's more expensive to support life vs. just do unmanned missions).p. 33 - ""It takes $10k to put a pound of anything up in space.""p. 34 - The story of the great imperial fleet of Admiral Zheng 1405 - 1433. I really want to look thi up, b/c this was a big deal as relates to why there are Chinese people in specific places on the earth like Madagascar. Glad to finally get a citation. p. 40 Jules Verne's method of shooting someone to the moon predates rocket fuel. That's a major innovation. Blue Origin - company by Bezo's rocket system is called New ShepardElon Musk's Space X is called Falcon Rocket.p. 41Blue origin is billing it as a tourism voyage with an orientation.p. 43 Beso's vision: ""The whole idea is to perserve the Earth... The goal [is] to be able to evacuate humans. The planet would become a park."" All the waste would be ejected into space. In 2017 he announced his plans: ""Once considered a lonely outpost in space, the moon would become a bustling industrial and commercial hub with permanent manned bases and manufacturing."" p. 44 Moon Express plans on mining the moon.p. 45 The outer space treaty does not contain any language related to real estate ownership of the moon and it's annoying to many people to think of it.p. 47 - The book moves into the other tech that has to exist if you're legit going to go the moon. The first has to do with medical care. Robots need to get better for things like remote-controlled surgery. Similarly a lot more work has to go in withstanding radiation.p. 50 Talks about how the moon was formed through a huge impact billions of years ago. The Earth looked like packman and the Moon a slice. All that changed through gravity.p. 62 - Musk's company's vision to Mars...he's on track to try to send a manned mission to mars by 2024. Typically estimates have said it would cost betwen $400-500b. He's trying to do it for $10bln. He's trying to get the price down per ride to $200k so that it competes with Virgin's galactic SpaceShipTwo. There's also pricing for the Russian rocket International Space Station which is $20-40m. I never knew the price of this stuff. Nice.p. 67 The total failure (which is always fatal) of going into space is about 1.5% (3 failures out of 135) with the fatality count being about 3.3%. With mars, most satellites do not make it there (3/4ths do not).p. 85 - MDRS Mars Desert Research station attempts to make realistic situations to determine the psychological effects of being on MARS.p. 87 - Terraforming in terms of DNA. There is an idea that DNA came from Mars and transformed the earth. p. 93 - They believe that MARS lost its magnetic field (necessary to protect the planet) from heavy bombardment. It's why the core is solid vs. lava like ours.p. 94 - ""The Earth is larger than Mars, so it did not coll down as quickly. The Earth also did not suffer a collapse of its magnetic field caused by giant meteor impacts."" p. 99 - Some people want to break off a piece of Europa and bring it to mars to repopulate the planet with water.p. 103 - Titan has atmosphere and would actually support life, though we'd stll need a few other things. p. 116 - The use of AI to help explore the planets in preparation for human entrance. Or alternatively,we just move our organic body into a computer one so we can enjoy space travel.p. 118 - He introduces Neural Networks p. 121 - Self-replicating robots are necessary in space. this describes what they have to be like.p. 129 He has a theory that humans differ from animals b/c we notice time. I'm not 100% sure I agree. but ok.p. 156 HE talks about the challenge of stopping a rocket ship.p. 158 The space elevator is another option often tossed around.p. 169 Parallax. didn't know that word.p. 170 - Talks about how we find planets with minor dimming of light.p. 178 talks about rogue planets.p. 190 sets up for the idea that medical drives the ability of humans to expand into new territories.Solving aging (telemeers) is about allowing us to go to space.p. 204 Again putting you in a robot might work.p. 206 - They talk about the exoskeleton and where that's at.p. 211 - The chip in glasses to type out a sentence is early stage communication via just neural activity.p. 226- What if alliens are WAY ahead of us? p. 233 - It almost goes backward in talking about what makes Humans the best on earth. It's not b/c we are strong We are actually worthless in strengh and other characteristics.p. 248 A dyson sphere is created around a star to harness the energy that comes off of it.p. 258 They are looking for someone that has done this in the galaxy to see if some other species has left a big footprint like we have on earth. So far, no luck.p. 261 Talks about how DNA can demonstrate the rate of divergence/mutation. It's really slow. Weird would have thought it would be driven by the amount/speed of procreation. p. 323 A great reading list. I'd like to one day take a look at all of these books."
240,0241304849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/912138-alex-givant,5,Excellent book about what we need to do to leave Earth and spread between stars.
241,0241304849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/897-abe,4,"I enjoyed reading that book. While I don't agree with some of the author's views on the future of humanity, the book is very well written in an engaging style. I am now excited to dig more into string theory and super symmetry. "
242,0241304849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22443749-debbie,4,"4.5 starsThe Future of Humanity is a fascinating piece of speculative astrophysics and science which seeks to explore the various ways humanity may expand our civilization across the universe. I thoroughly enjoyed how in depth Kaku got, not just laying out the potential opportunities but also fully explaining the science behind the theories. Despite this heavily scientific approach, this book never felt boring or overwhelming. Even if some of the topics were a little far-fetched, it was nevertheless an intriguing and engaging read.—75,000 years ago there was a major volcanic eruption (Topa); considered the biggest eruption in the past 25 million years. Some scientists speculate only 2,000 humans remained and had to repopulate, which is why DNA between people even if they’re not related is surprisingly similarWhen you consider every single creature that has ever lived on the earth such as amoebas, plants, dinosaurs etc., you find that 99.9% have gone extinct, meaning the creatures and living things that are alive today are an extremely small sliver of all the living things that have ever lived on the planetOur earth has gone through 5 major extinction cycles in our history, in which up to 90% of the living species went extinct at a timeBecause our galaxy has 100 billion stars there may be as many as 20 billion Earth sized planets in the Milky Way galaxy. it’s estimated there is 2 billion trillion earth sized planets in the visible universe including galaxies outside our ownThere is actually gravity in space and the feeling/illusion of weightlessness is because everything falls at the same rate so astronauts are falling at the same rate as the spaceshipIn the future, we may use the moon as a gas station, because ice at the South Pole can be used to farm oxygen and hydrogen which are primary components of rocket fuel, and also rare earth metals found there as well which are also able to be made into fuel. Helium 3 is also expected to be on the moon, which can be used for Fusion reactors. There is also talk of finding platinum. All this raises the question of whether it’s legal to mine on the moon and if so who can stake a claim on itIf we built a living space on the moon, at first it would need to be sent supplies from Earth every few weeks. The astronauts could use Internet, cell phones etc. as normal once they set up the proper technology because the delay between earth and the moon is only one second. They could potentially farm oxygen from the soil and water from the ice caps. The bases may be built underground to protect from solar radiation. There will need to be large amounts of solar panels because a moon day lasts an Earth month, so there are 2 weeks of day followed by 2 weeks of nightYour blood boils in the vacuum of space because as pressure drops the boiling point of water also dropsAstroids contain iron, nickel, carbon & cobalt, as well as significant quantities of rare earth metals and valuable metals including irradium, platinum, and rodium. It is believed that we will eventually mine the astroid belt, and many entrepreneurs have already expressed interest in finding ways to do so. 12 astroids have already been identified as key targets for mining, because only a slight nudge to their orbit would bring them closer towards earth and the moon and able to enter into orbit, making mining them much more efficientElon musk‘s goal with space X is to reduce the cost of commercial space travel by 10x. He was the 1st to invent a reusable booster capsule module rather than discarding it after use. His ultimate goal is to make it to Mars. His goal is to send a manned mission to Mars by 2024. He envisions eventually the cost of sending someone to Mars will be $200,000/person round-tripIt only takes 3?days to get to the moon but 9 months to get to Mars. A round trip to Mars would take 2 years. Potential dangers during this deep space trip include excessive exposure to radiation, damage to the ship from solar flares or micro astroids, muscular atrophy from being in reduced gravity so long, and psychological side effectsNASA plans on having a manned mission arrive at Mars by 2033; this plan involves creating a lunar space station from which ships could go to Mars, rather than going directly to Mars like space XLike the moon, explorers on Mars would be able to harvest water, oxygen, and hydrogen from the permafrost and ice to serve as sources for water, oxygen, and fuel. The days on Mars are similar in length to days on earth, but the temperature is extremely cold, barely above the freezing point of water during the day and dropping drastically at night. Like the moon, the gravity is less so explorers would have to exercise daily to avoid muscular atrophy and loss of bone density. Mars has both water ice caps and dry ice/CO2 ice caps. The water ice caps stay consistent year round, but the dry ice caps fluctuate with the seasons and mostly evaporate in the summerFor Mars to become truly habitable, we would need to find a way to slowly heat the atmosphere so liquid water could flow on the surface, allowing for plants to grow outside of contained greenhouses. Terraforming mars is probably centuries away, and may be prohibitively costly. To artificially raise the temperature of the planet, we may inject water vapor and methane into the atmosphere to create a greenhouse effect, or send satellites into orbit over the ice caps to direct concentrated sunlight towards the caps to cause them to melt and release water vapor. Eventually, this warming process would become self-sustaining as well as increase the atmospheric pressure of mars. As plants grow and proliferate, dying plants will enrich the soil, and growing plants will add oxygen to the atmosphereMars cooled down slower than Earth did. Mars no longer has a molten core but rather a solid rock core, so it doesn’t have a magnetic field. This is one of the factors that accelerated Mars’s atmosphere loss. Also, the carbon dioxide is mostly trapped in the ground instead of proliferating in the atmosphere, causing a reverse greenhouse effectSome of the moons of the gas giants are also viewed as potential candidates for human coloniesThe gas giants are theorized to have a thick gaseous atmosphere, a cold liquid hydrogen ocean around the entire planet, and a small, solid hydrogen core because of the extreme pressures. Jupiter is surrounded by radiation, which causes Radio interference. The gravity of Jupiter actually helps protect the earth from being bombarded by astroids because it essentially serves as a vacuum cleanerTitan (a moon of Saturn) is a potential candidate for human colonization, but because it’s so far away it can’t have self-sustaining greenhouse effect, and the lakes of ethane Could combust if it got too hot. But it could be a source of fuel. And it’s one of the few places in our solar system where we would be able to go outside without a spacesuit because it has enough of an atmosphere that our blood wouldn’t boil/we wouldn’t be crushed (we’d still need an oxygen mask). Europa (a moon of Jupiter) has potential for microbial life in its ocean (which sits under the layer of ice that encircles the moon, and was made possible because of friction caused from the extreme tidal forces caused by Jupiter’s gravity)All the gas giants have rings, which are likely caused by moons that got too close to the planet being torn apart by the planet’s gravityTitan and the Kuiper belt would most likely serve as refueling stations or points from which to jump to the next star or planetGraphene/carbon nanotubes will likely be the material used to make infrastructure on other planets, because it’s immensely strong yet incredibly light. We’re not at a point yet where we can mass produce it, because even a small impurity can ruin it, but once we have the technology to do so, it’ll be the best material to use. It could even be used to create skin-tight, lightweight spacesuitsFor Interstellar and planetary colonization to be realistic, we would need automatons—robots with more intelligence than our current ones who can perform a wide variety of tasks such as building cities on planets and moons, which would be easier for a robot (doesn’t need a spacesuit, doesn’t get affected by radiation, isn’t limited by oxygen supply, etc)Getting robots to understand common sense has been extremely difficult and currently prevents them from fully perceiving and navigating the world. Currently robots need human intervention to do most tasks. Modern robots will likely be a combination of top down and bottom up learning; they will have some information already integrated into their systems but they will also have neural networks that will allow them to learn from repetition and gain common sense. Robots would also need to be self replicatingIon engines may make it possible for the trip to Mars to take 40 days rather than 9 monthsPotential energy sources for traveling at the speed of light include light sailing (propelling with lasers), nuclear energy (propelling with nuclear explosions), and antimatter energy. an antimatter rocket would have 100% energy efficiency, whereas nuclear explosion only has 1% because most of the Energy is wasted. However only a very small amount of anti-matter exists naturally, so we would have to manufacture it (currently extremely expensive). Storing the antimatter would be difficult because it would have to be stored in a trap that suspends it in a magnetic field so it’s not able to touch the edges of the container; if it touch the edges it would destroy the containerSomething that would help make getting materials into space much easier and more economical is creating a space elevator that stretches from the surface of the earth out above our atmosphere. Scientists predict that it is theoretically possible to do so, possibly even by 2035, but we would need to find a way to make enough strong enough Materials for this to be feasible. Ideally pure carbon nanotubes would be used, but right now it would be difficult to make as much as would be neededTo travel faster than light at warp speed, we need to find a way to make vast quantities of negative matter or negative energy. We’ve been able to make small amounts of negative energy, but we are nowhere close to producing the amount needed to even consider developing warp drivesSuspended animation/cryogenic freezing to allow longer voyages without needing generations of people to live on a spaceship is currently not possible. While other animals are able to survive in suspended animation because of the levels of glucose in their blood which prevents their blood from freezing, the amount of sugar needed is too high for humansTelomeres are part of our chromosomes that get shorter with aging; when they get too short the cells can no longer divide. If we can prevent that shortening from happening, it would increase our life span because our cells would be able to divide and replicate themselves longer. However, cancer operates in the same way and is essentially immortal, so that would be a riskIf we were able to identify exactly what parts of our genetic make up contribute to aging, we could alter our genes to expand our life expectancyAging is thought to be the accumulation of errors in our genetic make up over time, so if we can prevent those errors from happening because of deteriorating cell replication then we can slow down the aging processIf we were able to somehow make ourselves inmortal, or drastically increase our life expectancy, then we would likely have to deal with extreme overpopulation eventually. Before the Industrial Revolution, the human population of the earth was 300 million or less. It has now grown to 7.5 billion and is anticipated to increase by 1 billion every 12 years. It is estimated that there will be 11.2 billion people on the earth by 2100. However, others argued that our increase in population is slowly going down and will stabilize before we reach a level of overpopulationA primate has never been cloned. If we come to the point where human cloning is possible, it is likely that only a small percentage of the population would do so. It is also speculated that eventually we will find ways to modify our genes or enhance our bodies through cybernetics, but we will likely not take it so far that we drastically modify our appearance. Modifications would likely be improvements to existing issues (ex: eyesight) or ways to improve our social standing, rather than becoming creatures with giant heads and huge eyes and skinny bodies. Our use of cybernetics would prevent us from evolving that drastically. If we were to disperse in colonies across the galaxy, our genetic makeup would remain within 0.1% difference between colonies (same as between humans currently)We may in the next century or so develop ways to laser port our consciousness across the galaxy so our physical bodies could remain in place while our consciousness is able to move at the speed of light to visit other places by being ported it into an avatarEarth like planets need to be accompanied by large gaseous Jupiter like planets to clear out incoming astroids. They also need to be accompanied by a larger moon to stabilize their spin and trajectoryThe drake equation attempts to estimate the probability that we will make contact with intelligent life forms; however there is still a lot of unknowns that prevent us from having an accurate assessment from this equationIf there are intelligent beings on other planets, we can’t assume that they communicate vocally the same way we do. They might communicate through pheromones like bugs, or sonar like batsIntelligent life will likely follow the laws of evolution. An intelligent species will likely be descended from predators, so it will have forward facing eyes. They will also likely have opposable thumbs or some type of grasping appendage. They will also have some form of languageKardishev scale of civilizations: A type 1 civilization (planetary) uses all the energy of the sunlight that falls on the planet. Type 2 civilization (stellar) uses all the energy it’s sun produces. A type 3 civilization (galactic) uses the energy of an entire galaxy. We are currently a type 0.7 civilization because we’re not using the full energy of all the sunlight shining on our planet. We are about a century or two away from becoming a full type 1, and possibly A few thousand years from becoming a type 2. We might not become type 3 for 100,000 years or even up to 1 million because it requires a level of interstellar travel that we’re nowhere close to having. The energy measurements for each type just means and equivalent amount of energy, it doesn’t mean you have to be getting all your energy from the sun. Each next level of civilization is between 10 to 100 billion times more powerful than the previous typeA civilization that has reached type 2 is likely nearly immortal, and most of its energy generating machinery will likely be placed off planet because there will be so much energy being produced that it creates too much heat for the planet to be habitable. They will likely also harvest energy from their sun through a Dyson sphere and because of the vast quantities they are harvesting Will emit infrared radiationThere is another scale of civilization that is calculated based on the amount of information it consumes as proposed by Carl Sagan. Type A civilization consumes 1,000,000 bits of information. Type Z civilization consumes a 10^31 bits of information. We are a type H civilization. By this scale a type two civilization would be able to consume energy through widely distributed Dyson sphere, harvesting from astroids, developing super efficient nano technology, etc. and avoid giving up the levels of infrared radiation that would make it detectable to usOur first encounter with alien civilization will likely be a robotic self replicating probeString theory exists in 10 dimensions. It cancels out quantum corrections, basically meaning it cancels out the fact that quantum things like electrons and protons are able to be in multiple places at once. This quantum cancellation can only happen in 10 dimensions. The pairing for particles in string theory is sparticles, quarks are squarks, etc. String theory assumes an infinite number of universes (Multiverse). String theory says the universe was originally 10 dimensions, then for some reason the other 6 dimensions “curled up” leaving us with only 4 perceivable dimensionsDark matter was discovered because astrophysicist realized that the Milky Way was spinning 10 times faster than Newtonian physics would allow without flying apart, so they realize there must be some invisible thing adding all that extra mass to the galaxy. Dark matter is invisible, but it bends starlight so we’re able to detect it that way. Dark matter has gravity, but can’t be held/interact with matter in any way. It’s electrically neutral and only interacts with gravity. However we’ve never been able to officially prove that dark matter exist yet or create it ourselves in any way. Once we do, it will prove string theoryString theory is the only way would be able to do calculations about the quantum corrections needed for time travel, going through a wormhole, faster than light travel, etcThe universe is expected to eventually end in 1 of 3 ways: the big crunch, the big freeze, or the big rip. The big crunch is when the expansion of the universe slow down, stops, and reverses itself, eventually coalescing in a giant wad of superheated matter and possibly eventually turning into another big bang. For the big freeze, by the laws of entropy eventually the stars will stop shining, the sky will go black and temperature will reach absolute zero wherein matter nearly ceases to move. The big rip refers to the fact that the universe is exponentially expanding far faster than anticipated, and that distant galaxies will eventually speed away from us faster than the speed of light and disappear. Eventually our galaxy and solar system would be torn apart from this rapid expansion. The universe would end in an explosion, a singularity of infinite energyOur sun will exhaust its energy in about 5 billion years; it will expand into a red giant star which will essentially set the earth on fire, mountains will melt, oceans will boil, and the earth will be engulfed. After this, the sun will exhaust all its nuclear fuel and shrink and go cold as a white dwarf and then die as a dark dwarf star. In 4.8 billion years, the Milky Way and Andromeda galaxy’s will collide. There are two black holes will collide and merge and a new galaxy will eventually be formedDark energy is the energy of a vacuum. It acts like antigravity, and it pushes the universe apart. It is different than dark matter. The more the universe expands, the more dark energy there is, which makes the universe expand faster. About 69% of the matter/energy in the universe is contained in dark energy. Dark matter makes up 26%. Atoms of hydrogen and helium make up about 5%. And other higher elements that make up the earth, our bodies, etc. only make up 0.5%A possible way to overcome the eventual death of our universe is by becoming a type 4 civilization that harnesses extragalactic energy like dark energy and is able to reverse the big rip by creating a sphere in which dark energy reverses polarity so that inside the sphere The galaxies continue to survive normally while outside the sphere the universe is continuing to expand rapidly and tear itself apart. Another possible solution is that we find a way to leave our universe and go to one of the other theoretical bubble universes in the Multiverse. They could use negative energy to create a wormhole. The bubble universes are floating in a 10 dimensional arena—Read for the Astronomy prompt for the 2019 OWLs Readathon"
243,0241304849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2168708-marta,5,"I loved this so much that I listened to it twice. The second reason for listening twice is that it is chock full of info that is easy to miss in an audio format - so I also downloaded the Kindle version...I love Michio Kaku’s books. This one is about fun science of the future. Space travel - where are we, what do we still need to do, where would we go, how would we need to alter ourselves for outer space, what spacecrafts would we use, etc. Fun stuff, all told in an approachable, interesting story format. Kaku loves science fiction and peppers the narrative with movie and book references. Interestingly enough, he judges most of it more science and less fiction. Kaku is a physics professor, thus the physics are very solid; but I have my doubts on some of the biotechnology parts. Nevertheless, a thoroughly enjoyable book that I ended up listening to within about a day."
244,0241304849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8686546-feyzan---the-raven-boy,3,"3.5 starsthe journey of a thousand miles begins with the first stepI don't know what I was thinking when I picked this book up. I don't usually like to read books that are dense with physics and cosmology, but I admire michio kaku so i had to give this one a try. I am not surprised to feel disappointed, however. This book was pretty good on entertainment, and I understand why nerds would love it, but it did nothing for me, except maybe entertain a little. I couldn't take this book seriously as it was brimming with speculations about things that may or may not happen in next 5 billion years. I mean instead of worrying about what will happen in 5 billion years shouldn't we focus on saving our planet from all the man made chaos?I enjoyed the science fiction elements and reading about how tenaciously scientists are trying to make science fiction a new reality for humanity. It was all very interesting to read. The book covered many topics like terraforming, multi-verse, robotics, transhumanism. All these heavy and dense topic were easier to grasp and understand thanks to michio kaku's writing style and movie references. It feels like a new war is in order between the richest people of the world as they compete to colonize Mars and the universe itself. I think these rich people, Instead of spending billions of dollars on space exploration and planning to colonize other planets, should spend some of their foturne and influence to make this planet safe for everyone, Just saying. When I was a kid I used to dream about meeting aliens, going on a mission to space and whatnot. My imaginations used to very elaborated,  I used to imagine alines and robots in a very fanciful way. Robots used to have chips inside of them that could shut them off, if they tried to take over the world. Then I grew up. However, reading this book made me realize that some people are incapable of growing up.
 When self-aware robots do arrive, we must add a fail-safe chip that will shut them off if they have murderous thoughts.
I mean, first of all, no self aware robot is arriving anytime soon. Second of all, no self-aware robot will insert a chip inside of itself (I forgot to mention these robots are supposed to be self-replicating too.) Anyway, you get the idea this book is high on speculation and overflowing with head-scratching logic.
In 2017, a controversy arose between two billionaires, Mark Zuckerberg, founder of Facebook, and Elon Musk of SpaceX and Tesla. Zuckerberg maintained that artificial intelligence was a great generator of wealth and prosperity that will enrich all of society. Musk, however, took a much darker view and stated that AI actually posed an existential risk to all of humanity, that one day our creations may turn on us.
Wow, this exactly what we needed to be discussing right now. 🙄 Zuckerbergs' first concern should be to be make Facebook safe and secure again, not this. And then this book celebrate psychotic maniacs and call them heroes. 
 He confided to me that he takes several hundred pills a day, anticipating his own immortality
I guess, this book isn't meant to be taken seriously. It's just good to get inside the heads of scientists and learn how they operate and how they see the future. This book has imbued me with unnecessary knowledge that I don't know where and how to use. This knowledge is increasing my, already soaring, existential angst that wont rest until I use this knowledge somewhere. Anyway, this book isn't bad. It just wasn't for me. I am sure nerds and Sci-fi fans will love it."
245,0241304849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/77527711-j-c-ahmed,5,"The Future of Humanity, as the title suggests, makes predictions about humanity's future. Kaku addresses the possibilities of setting up permanent bases on the moon and terraforming Mars. At some point, humanity will need to move beyond the solar system to settle planets revolving around nearby stars. He also addresses genetic changes people may undergo, how humans will begin to merge with AI/machines, and ways immortality may become possible. It's fascinating stuff that should please both science and sci-fi fans."

It really normalizes the thoughts of leaving Earth and not only exploring beyond, but settling beyond. Even crazier notions of removing our minds from our bodies to travel via laser beams to the exterior of our galaxy into exoskeletons waiting for us is explored. And logically. I recommend this book just for the sake of expanding your thoughts on outer space and the future of where humankind may end up."

Off course It was a pleasant experience because it get me acquainted with a world which I was unfamiliar with.

From space to physics theories, everything was explained in simple words and that was the beauty of this book. Reading this book gives you a clear insight about the future of us as humans and discusses several probable possibilities in the long life span of humankind during his/her adventure in the space. I recommend those who are new to this genre, to read this work as their first experience, and I promise that it will be their best first experience!📚😊"
249,0241304849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7258380-dan-graser,4,"In his latest work, physicist Michio Kaku has focused on the what the future life of humanity might be as pertains to several possible scenarios. Throughout the work he mostly does a decent job of suggesting how plausible these ideas are, or at the very least, the type of timeframe needed to develop the requisite technological capabilities to achieve them. Beginning with the colonization of Mars, Kaku does a fine job of explaining just how this very popular notion would have to work, the costs involved, where our current capabilities stand, and just who is at the forefront of this quest. As NASA continues to be underfunded, though they do have a Mars program in operation, private funding has taken over much of this territory and the competition created by these developments is changing just how (some, particularly wealthy) humans may leave this planet for good.Next Kaku takes up the idea of interstellar travel. This is one area where the type of technology required is hundreds of years away. This distances to other star systems is staggering, our technology still primitive, and the pace at which we could develop any sort of device traveling remotely close to the speed of light is very difficult to predict. Some hugely interesting ideas are posited but he is quick to note that many of these are at the moment very unrealistic.The intersection of AI and humanity is discussed but not in particularly great detail. I would recommend Max Tegmark on this subject as his picture is a bit more complete. Anyone who has read the literature on this likely already has a more thorough understanding than is presented in this section.Finally and perhaps most significantly, Kaku details what physics tells us about the end of space and time and the possibility to forestall these dire (though billions of years in the future) events with technology developed to harness the gravitational effect of dark matter and dark energy. As we still have no idea as to the workings of either of these this is of course purely speculative but this is the first I've heard of these compelling ideas. As with all of his books, Kaku is an engaging and accessible writer that only occasionally veers into oversimplification or inclusion of ideas purely for their mass appeal, not for their plausibility. This is an effective summary of where we are as pertains to the possible routes humanity might take to ensure, at the level of our entire species, our survival. Wonderful reading all around."
250,0241304849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8676317-a-man-called-ove,4,"अनंत से भी आगे !4.5/5 Michio Kaku reminds me of APJ Abdul Kalam in his optimism and enthusiasm about the future. Unlike pessimists like Harari who fear human life becoming meaningless by advances in AI, he imagines using progresses in technology to settle and terraform Mars and elsewhere ! The first section which focuses on near future technologies and space travel was an absolute delight.Also, his vision is not limited to the next decade or 20 years, he also talks about possibilities in the next 100 and 1000 years and even later. Except for the last chapters on wormholes and time-travel which felt weird, enjoyed this joyride. A bit like a spiritual guru the author was expanding my mind’s horizons with his thought-experiments.Will be reading more by this author."
251,0241304849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35088694-carly-friedman,4,"3.5 stars rounded up. I loved the first 2/3 of the book! The last few chapters started to drag, though. The last section on string theory and quantum physics was too advanced for me, unfortunately. Overall, I learned some fascination information about our galaxy, technological innovations, space travel, and threats to our planet. I do recommend it!"
252,0241304849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67214408-sathya,3,"If not for the end chapters where there is just too much discussion on theoretical physics, which does not seem entirely related to the subject matter of the book, or the seemingly very broad thought leaps on how we will become a multi-galactic species in the far future, this is a fascinating read on the near-future impact of space travel and the potential move to Mars. "
253,0241304849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2433243-ayami,4,"Michio Kaku talks about a lot of interesting concepts regarding technology, space exploration and science. It wasn’t a mind-blowing read, though, as the majority of what he talks about has been mentioned in plenty of other non-fiction books out there. However, I won’t penalize the book for introducing themes I happened to be already familiar with. Some physics stuff I found hard to follow but this could be due to the fact, I was listening to it as an audiobook. Some reviewers complained about the onslaught of the pop culture references but I enjoyed them and think they were pretty well incorporated into the text. This could be because I have seen the majority of the movies mentioned, though. "
254,0241304849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31705923-zahan,3,"Interesting content, but I'm not a huge fan of the writing. It’s really surface-level, leaping across one discipline to another. As someone well-familiar with the scientific principles, I almost rather he focus on fewer topics, but cover them more in-depth.Also, he’s often describing implementation for problems so far out that really all we should be talking about is principles and concepts.Good food for thought, but unfortunately not as satisfying as I’d hoped!"
255,0241304849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/106503484-connor-steckly,4,"This book is not too long but seemingly has no scope. The wide range of topics it covers acts as a good introduction to the leading edge (and beyond) technologies that will enable humanity to live on multiple planets and moons across the universe. Although the last two chapters were overly technical, the book overall was fantastic and scratched the surface on a number of topics to look into further. "
256,0241304849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12087691-wendyb,4,"Interesting, easily readable. Covers a lot of territory (no pun intended) in space exploration but not in much depth, just gives an overview of subjects related to rocketry, life in space and the possibilities of humans living on other worlds."
257,0241304849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6474662-sarah,5,best non-fiction book i've read this year (shhh its the first one but STILL)
258,0241304849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12889617-anne,3,"While there was definitely some fascinating future speculation here, overall I found that this was just TOO much information, on TOO broad of a scope, and I found myself wanting to skim ahead. I think this would make a better podcast series, breaking it down into more easily digestible sections. But perhaps I'm just not a serious enough space-nerd to fully enjoy ALL the material presented!"
259,0241304849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3181307-tony,3,"The Future of Humanity is a collection of Kaku's musings about the technology our species may develop in the years, centuries, and millennia to come. Topics range from propulsion systems to AI and biological enhancements. While a number of the author's ideas are not particularly convincing, virtually all are interesting."
260,0241304849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6991670-bob,4,"Summary: An exploration of the possibility and necessity of humanity becoming a multi-planetary species, and the revolutions of technology necessary to realize that future.Michio Kaku is a theoretical theorist studying string theory at the City University of New York, and the author of a series of best-selling futurist works based on his knowledge of physics and other fields. He is also a riveting, passionate speaker who believes, along with others like Elon Musk, that we must envision becoming a multi-planetary species. This, the latest of his books, explores that idea, it's necessity, and the technological advances that could make this possible.Kaku argument for the necessity of becoming a multi-planetary species is rooted in the priority of the survival of the human species. He is convinced that, whether through physical causes ranging from cataclysmic volcanoes to asteroids or the final death throes of the sun, our planet will become unlivable for human beings--if we do not accomplish this first through human causation as in nuclear holocaust or global warming. Discussing other great challenges we've faced through history, he writes:But now we face perhaps the greatest challenge of all: to leave the confines of the Earth and soar into outer space. The laws of physics are clear; sooner or later we will face global crises that threaten our very existence. (p.6)In three parts he explores the technologies that can make this possible. The first part explores interplanetary settlement efforts within our solar system, using moon as a base, and Mars as our first settlement, and later possibly settling, or exploiting the resources of the large moons orbiting the gas giants of Jupiter and Saturn. He describes existing efforts by public and private enterprise to return to the moon and create settlements on Mars. This itself is formidable considering exposures to radioactivity and the inhospitable nature of the planet but he argues for the eventual possibility of terra-forming Mars, making it livable and life sustaining. What is fascinating is that much of this is possible by applying and extending our current technology, albeit at great cost.The second part of the book seemed like something out of Star Trek, exploring the technologies of interstellar travel. All of this is beyond our current technologies. As a physicist, he takes us on a tour of possible technologies from nanoships and laser and solar sail propelled vehicles, to ramjet fusion and antimatter engines, and proposes that the warp drive of The Enterprise is possible, and consists not in propelling one faster than light, but literally warping space so that a vessel is pulled through it at hyper light speeds. Nearly all of this requires inordinately great quantities of energy, and presupposes a level of civilization at which we harness, first the energies of the sun, and than galactic levels of energy. This will allow us to explore at least the nearby stars or further into a galaxy of stars where it is increasingly evident that there are many possible habitable planets.The third part explores the reality that the great distances to be traveled, even should we exceed the speed of light, either require multi-generational crews, or advances toward immortality. He explores research on curing aging, on trans-humanism in which humans and machines become increasingly integrated. He discusses the Human Connectome Project, in which human neural networks are mapped, digitized, and potentially could be reproduced light years away, transmitted via laser networks. He also speculates on the existence of other more advanced civilizations. He mentions observations of recurring drops in energy output of star KIC 8462852 by as much as 30 percent positing an object 22 times as large as Jupiter, speculating that one possibility would be a megastructure like a Dyson sphere constructed by an alien civilization.This part also gets into Kaku's area of theoretical physics, string theory, as he explores the possibility of travel through wormholes and stargates and perhaps even escaping the present universe into one of many multiverses, particularly useful when this one burns out.Whew! Kaku's tour of the technologies necessary for interstellar travel is both breathtaking, and staggering. On one hand, much of the technology we use today, even that I am using as I write, was science fiction in my childhood. It is always dangerous to scoff at what seems impossible. The cell phone at my side represents applications of theoretical physics unknown 150 years ago in terms of the miniaturized circuitry and memory, cellular and wi-fi capabilities, GPS tracking, and touch screens. What would have been an object of wonder 150 years ago is now a commonplace of many of our lives. Yet what Kaku describes in this book, particularly in parts two and three, strings together ventures of immense cost, requiring unimaginable amounts of power, huge quantities of rare (and dangerous) resources like anti-matter, as well as scenarios, the survivability of which are in question, all of which to preserve the human species on a multi-planetary scale. Of course Kaku allows millenia for reaching such capabilities.The most credible part of the book for me was the near-term ideas of travel to Mars, perhaps even establishing some form of outpost there. If something of a cataclysmic nature were to occur on Earth in the next couple centuries, such an outpost might preserve civilization, and even re-settle earth. Even this is tremendously costly as well as risky. We must expect lives to be lost, even as they were among other explorers and settlers throughout our history. But it also raised questions of several sorts.Some were questions of priority. Should we think of terra-forming Mars when our own planet's earth, water and air need so much attention? Should we pour huge funds and inordinate amounts of energy into space travel when transport on earth is still carbon-based and polluting? When we are not yet addressing preventable diseases of childhood, and providing quality and affordable health care on a global basis, is it right to pour huge amounts into life-extending technologies that may benefit a select few? Or even as we think about planetary defense, might we focus on technologies for detection and destruction of planet-threatening objects from outer space? All this falls under the question of caring for the planet and people that we have before we think about settling other worlds.Some are more fundamental questions having to do with whether we ought to do these things. I think of this particularly around the discussion of immortality. Kaku fails to deal with the issue of whether it is a good thing for humans with our flawed as well as noble nature to live for ever. Have you ever noticed how, as people age, they become who they always were, to an even greater degree? We may grow both more loving and more neurotic. We may grow more knowledgeable and more petty. The closest he gets to this is when he quotes the late Stephen Hawking who said, ""We only have to look at ourselves to see how intelligent life might develop into something we wouldn't want to meet."" In my own faith tradition, we believe that it is a severe mercy of God that flawed and fallen people don't live endlessly in our bodies and that hope is found not in endless mortal life, but life everlasting beyond bodily death.Finally, I am troubled with the hubristic strains that carry as much attraction for many contemporary hearers as they did for the first couple in the garden, and the tower builders of Babel. Kaku writes:...our destiny is to become the gods we once feared and worshipped. Science will give us the means by which we can shape the universe in our image. The question is whether we will have the wisdom of Solomon to accompany this vast celestial power. (p. 14)""You shall be as gods"" has been a temptation from the very beginning, and is one this book proffers to its readers. Along with that temptation comes tower-building (or space elevator) projects that reflect our pitiful efforts to offset our creaturely vulnerabilities. Will we exchange dependence on the sustenance of the Creator and responsible care for the world we've been given for anxious and costly efforts to preserve ourselves in other worlds, and perhaps neglect the most vulnerable on our own planet? I find the reference to Solomon fascinating, because the record tells us that, while wise, he abandoned the fear of God which is the beginning of wisdom, giving himself to building projects that taxed and enslaved, and that he multiplied wives and experiences. If Ecclesiastes gives us the final verdict on this project, it is all summed up as ""meaningless,"" ""a chasing after the wind,"" and that ""with much wisdom comes much sorrow."" It seems that this is what always comes of trying to make ourselves gods, and trying to stave off death when a universe of wonder and a world of beauty to be cared for beckons us to trust its Maker."
261,0241304849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37759920-neha-prasad,5,"A brilliant read! The first and foremost thought I had while reading this book was how shockingly poor my knowledge in astronomy was. The book covers a vast variety of concepts pertaining to universe, space travel, relativity, quantum theory, time travel and other likes written in a lucid fashion."
262,0241304849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1639329-erik,2,"A mile wide, an inch deep. It's simple to the point of being erroneous: He'll spend a single sentence glossing over a profound problem that'll take billions of manhours to resolve. Not to mention some truly stupid claims in here, such as his belief that only human beings (as opposed to other animals) possess an awareness of time. That's incorrect by inspection.And worse - it's boring. It feels less like ""The Future of Humanity"" and more like ""Cliffnotes of the Future of Humanity."" You would be vastly better served reading a science fiction book that explores these ideas of interstellar travel, generation arks, AI, etc. The Martian; The Expanse; etc, etc.BUT one major positive is just how much research this book inspired me into. It has a lot of references to real and underway projects. Following up on these was both fun and informative."
263,0241304849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22189980-belhor,3,"Interesting enough. Kaku is easy to read and I love the fact that he always quotes lots of interesting people in his writing. This book is the second book from Kaku that I've read, and even though I liked his ""Parallel Worlds"" more, this one is also a pretty decent book. I would have liked if he went through a little more details specially in the first chapters. The book gets better when you are almost halfway through."
264,0241304849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21091961-jacques-bezuidenhout,3,"Nice, easy to follow explanation of scientific concepts, and how humans are likely to evolve in future.I might have given the book a higher rating if I didn't already touch on most of the concepts discussed in other books:The Space Barons: Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, and the Quest to Colonize the CosmosHomo Deus: A Brief History of TomorrowA Short History of Nearly EverythingThere is quite a bit of overlap.This book is a nice summary putting the relevant information together and sequencing them chronologically.This book is also fairly new. So some of the facts contained goes up to things happening in 2017, which is nice.The latter part of the book touching on quantum and string theory, starts going over one's head a bit. Although explained as simple as possible, it does become a bit difficult to follow in audio format. You also need to be really open minded to get your head around some of the concepts / possibilities presented for the future. Since most are speculative, and mostly relies on things humans aren't even close to achieving."
265,0241304849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/93786551-nirali-lakdawala,4,"Its an amazing book and it takes you to space and beyond. The concepts are well explained & the way michio kaku talks about universe, the different ways to travel distance and the way we as a civilization will evolve is just superb."
266,0241304849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60980219-catherine-cole,5,"Although scientists might think the explanations given to the topics in this book may be a little too ""dumbed-down"" for their liking, they must remember that this book is for general audiences, who may not have the same knowledge or vocabulary as they do, therefore, simple explanations and comparisons to situations the non-scientific population can understand are necessary.This book takes you on a journey from the very first notions of rockets to hypothetic scenarios where you can transport your consciousness in laser beams to planets beyond our galaxy, and even escape the end of this universe.Many fascinating theories for space travel, building stations and ports in moons and asteroids, modifying our bodies to adapt to a non-planetary existence, and the different types of civilizations we might become, make this an eye/mind-opening read. Plus, it is a treasure chest of ideas for science fiction writers, who do not have the limitations of time or budget to make new realities come true on a page."
267,0241304849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73029907-cav,5,"This was an exceptionally well-formatted and written book. I really enjoyed it. This is my first from author Michio Kaku, but won't be my last.Kaku writes with a very engaging style, that holds the reader's attention effortlessly. This is a welcome change to many, many other science books I have read that are plagued by long-winded, esoteric and dry writing.The book is written in an easy-to-follow manner that would be suitable for the layperson who may be not too familiar with science. Kaku is an extremely effective science communicator; he takes complicated ideas, and conveys them in a simple and easy to understand manner. We need many more like him, IMHO.As mentioned, the book's formatting is excellent, as well. It is broken down into 3 main parts:
1) LEAVING THE EARTH2) VOYAGE TO THE STARS3) LIFE IN THE UNIVERSE
Which then break further down into different chapters. Kaku ends most chapters with a really natural segway to the upcoming one. The book has an excellent flow to it.If you were a fan of sci-fi as a kid, or are curious about what the future has in store for the human race, then this book is for you. The Future of Humanity covers (among many others): *The history of rockets; pioneers Goddard and von Braun.*Missions to the moon and Mars; the possibilities of living on either.*The asteroid belt, and possibilities of mining them.*The gas giants, Venus, Titan, and other moons.*Robotics, AI, and self-replicating robots.*Transhumanism*Spaceships; different theoretical technologies, and rocket types.*Black holes, wormholes, and spacetime.*The possibility of life on other worlds.*String theory and multiverses.I thoroughly enjoyed this book, and would most definitely recommend it to anyone interested in astronomy, physics, and the future of humanity in general. It is a big-picture book, with many incredible ideas that are sure to capture your imagination.5 stars, and a spot on my ""Favorites"" shelf."
268,0241304849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25338445-angie-reisetter,3,"Kaku is a great tour guide to the possibilities of the distant future. He imagines what may be possible, or at least what is not ruled out by the laws of physics as we know them. He has the tendency in this book, as he does in his others, to introduce topics with words like ""perhaps"" and ""might"", and then to drop them altogether, so that it sounds like he is telling us what will happen, casting aside minor difficulties like cost and human will. He threads science fiction references throughout his narrative, almost organizing his argument by what he's seen/read in science fiction. That's not a terrible way to go, but he also blurs the line of reality there, asking himself how we reconcile two different views of the future, as if they are not fictional and must be reconciled. The whole thing is very entertaining. But he has a theorist's tendency to discount reality, which is always my criticism of his work. But I did come back for more, and his work is always worth reading. A little inspiration is called for right about now.There seem to be a number of science futures becoming available in the near future, and I've recently read Soonish: Ten Emerging Technologies That'll Improve and/or Ruin Everything, which is very different from this one. I recommend them both as a study in contrasts: Kaku's extends to the limits of what might be possible one day maybe, and Soonish tries to keep it, well, soonish, in the realm of the reasonably possible. They have some topics in common, but they diverge rather dramatically.I got a copy to review from Net Galley."

I'd love it if you'd check me out and consider following/subscribing.You know, there is a crazy need that people have to judge a book by its title. It almost never is the case that that is what a book is on about. Perhaps a more accurate title would be: This is what Star Trek envisions and here's the status on where we're at. In that case, the book is amazing b/c it's quite hard to get that accomplished. If you look at the sea of references in the back and also read it, you'll realize how difficult it was to write something that is this comprehensive, albiet, much of detais of his reference are in the footnotes. p. 2 - He talks about the similarities between humans vs. chimps as a cohort a supposes that some cataclysmic event took out the genetic diversity that once was.p. 20 ""The amount of fuel you need reises exponentially with the change in velocity so that enormous amounts of fuel are needed to give an extra boost to speed."" (ok, a little wordy. What he's saying is it's hard to increasingly acceleration (that's what change in velocity is). You're going to need to accellorate for a while and at a crazy high speed if you want to leave earth for another planet. They are pretty far away.p. 32 - He deals with some of the politics and economics. He talks about it being easier to fund a person going into space vs program itself. As a result, many compromises (as that's more expensive to support life vs. just do unmanned missions).p. 33 - ""It takes $10k to put a pound of anything up in space.""p. 34 - The story of the great imperial fleet of Admiral Zheng 1405 - 1433. I really want to look thi up, b/c this was a big deal as relates to why there are Chinese people in specific places on the earth like Madagascar. Glad to finally get a citation. p. 40 Jules Verne's method of shooting someone to the moon predates rocket fuel. That's a major innovation. Blue Origin - company by Bezo's rocket system is called New ShepardElon Musk's Space X is called Falcon Rocket.p. 41Blue origin is billing it as a tourism voyage with an orientation.p. 43 Beso's vision: ""The whole idea is to perserve the Earth... The goal [is] to be able to evacuate humans. The planet would become a park."" All the waste would be ejected into space. In 2017 he announced his plans: ""Once considered a lonely outpost in space, the moon would become a bustling industrial and commercial hub with permanent manned bases and manufacturing."" p. 44 Moon Express plans on mining the moon.p. 45 The outer space treaty does not contain any language related to real estate ownership of the moon and it's annoying to many people to think of it.p. 47 - The book moves into the other tech that has to exist if you're legit going to go the moon. The first has to do with medical care. Robots need to get better for things like remote-controlled surgery. Similarly a lot more work has to go in withstanding radiation.p. 50 Talks about how the moon was formed through a huge impact billions of years ago. The Earth looked like packman and the Moon a slice. All that changed through gravity.p. 62 - Musk's company's vision to Mars...he's on track to try to send a manned mission to mars by 2024. Typically estimates have said it would cost betwen $400-500b. He's trying to do it for $10bln. He's trying to get the price down per ride to $200k so that it competes with Virgin's galactic SpaceShipTwo. There's also pricing for the Russian rocket International Space Station which is $20-40m. I never knew the price of this stuff. Nice.p. 67 The total failure (which is always fatal) of going into space is about 1.5% (3 failures out of 135) with the fatality count being about 3.3%. With mars, most satellites do not make it there (3/4ths do not).p. 85 - MDRS Mars Desert Research station attempts to make realistic situations to determine the psychological effects of being on MARS.p. 87 - Terraforming in terms of DNA. There is an idea that DNA came from Mars and transformed the earth. p. 93 - They believe that MARS lost its magnetic field (necessary to protect the planet) from heavy bombardment. It's why the core is solid vs. lava like ours.p. 94 - ""The Earth is larger than Mars, so it did not coll down as quickly. The Earth also did not suffer a collapse of its magnetic field caused by giant meteor impacts."" p. 99 - Some people want to break off a piece of Europa and bring it to mars to repopulate the planet with water.p. 103 - Titan has atmosphere and would actually support life, though we'd stll need a few other things. p. 116 - The use of AI to help explore the planets in preparation for human entrance. Or alternatively,we just move our organic body into a computer one so we can enjoy space travel.p. 118 - He introduces Neural Networks p. 121 - Self-replicating robots are necessary in space. this describes what they have to be like.p. 129 He has a theory that humans differ from animals b/c we notice time. I'm not 100% sure I agree. but ok.p. 156 HE talks about the challenge of stopping a rocket ship.p. 158 The space elevator is another option often tossed around.p. 169 Parallax. didn't know that word.p. 170 - Talks about how we find planets with minor dimming of light.p. 178 talks about rogue planets.p. 190 sets up for the idea that medical drives the ability of humans to expand into new territories.Solving aging (telemeers) is about allowing us to go to space.p. 204 Again putting you in a robot might work.p. 206 - They talk about the exoskeleton and where that's at.p. 211 - The chip in glasses to type out a sentence is early stage communication via just neural activity.p. 226- What if alliens are WAY ahead of us? p. 233 - It almost goes backward in talking about what makes Humans the best on earth. It's not b/c we are strong We are actually worthless in strengh and other characteristics.p. 248 A dyson sphere is created around a star to harness the energy that comes off of it.p. 258 They are looking for someone that has done this in the galaxy to see if some other species has left a big footprint like we have on earth. So far, no luck.p. 261 Talks about how DNA can demonstrate the rate of divergence/mutation. It's really slow. Weird would have thought it would be driven by the amount/speed of procreation. p. 323 A great reading list. I'd like to one day take a look at all of these books."

272,0241304849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22443749-debbie,4,"4.5 starsThe Future of Humanity is a fascinating piece of speculative astrophysics and science which seeks to explore the various ways humanity may expand our civilization across the universe. I thoroughly enjoyed how in depth Kaku got, not just laying out the potential opportunities but also fully explaining the science behind the theories. Despite this heavily scientific approach, this book never felt boring or overwhelming. Even if some of the topics were a little far-fetched, it was nevertheless an intriguing and engaging read.—75,000 years ago there was a major volcanic eruption (Topa); considered the biggest eruption in the past 25 million years. Some scientists speculate only 2,000 humans remained and had to repopulate, which is why DNA between people even if they’re not related is surprisingly similarWhen you consider every single creature that has ever lived on the earth such as amoebas, plants, dinosaurs etc., you find that 99.9% have gone extinct, meaning the creatures and living things that are alive today are an extremely small sliver of all the living things that have ever lived on the planetOur earth has gone through 5 major extinction cycles in our history, in which up to 90% of the living species went extinct at a timeBecause our galaxy has 100 billion stars there may be as many as 20 billion Earth sized planets in the Milky Way galaxy. it’s estimated there is 2 billion trillion earth sized planets in the visible universe including galaxies outside our ownThere is actually gravity in space and the feeling/illusion of weightlessness is because everything falls at the same rate so astronauts are falling at the same rate as the spaceshipIn the future, we may use the moon as a gas station, because ice at the South Pole can be used to farm oxygen and hydrogen which are primary components of rocket fuel, and also rare earth metals found there as well which are also able to be made into fuel. Helium 3 is also expected to be on the moon, which can be used for Fusion reactors. There is also talk of finding platinum. All this raises the question of whether it’s legal to mine on the moon and if so who can stake a claim on itIf we built a living space on the moon, at first it would need to be sent supplies from Earth every few weeks. The astronauts could use Internet, cell phones etc. as normal once they set up the proper technology because the delay between earth and the moon is only one second. They could potentially farm oxygen from the soil and water from the ice caps. The bases may be built underground to protect from solar radiation. There will need to be large amounts of solar panels because a moon day lasts an Earth month, so there are 2 weeks of day followed by 2 weeks of nightYour blood boils in the vacuum of space because as pressure drops the boiling point of water also dropsAstroids contain iron, nickel, carbon & cobalt, as well as significant quantities of rare earth metals and valuable metals including irradium, platinum, and rodium. It is believed that we will eventually mine the astroid belt, and many entrepreneurs have already expressed interest in finding ways to do so. 12 astroids have already been identified as key targets for mining, because only a slight nudge to their orbit would bring them closer towards earth and the moon and able to enter into orbit, making mining them much more efficientElon musk‘s goal with space X is to reduce the cost of commercial space travel by 10x. He was the 1st to invent a reusable booster capsule module rather than discarding it after use. His ultimate goal is to make it to Mars. His goal is to send a manned mission to Mars by 2024. He envisions eventually the cost of sending someone to Mars will be $200,000/person round-tripIt only takes 3?days to get to the moon but 9 months to get to Mars. A round trip to Mars would take 2 years. Potential dangers during this deep space trip include excessive exposure to radiation, damage to the ship from solar flares or micro astroids, muscular atrophy from being in reduced gravity so long, and psychological side effectsNASA plans on having a manned mission arrive at Mars by 2033; this plan involves creating a lunar space station from which ships could go to Mars, rather than going directly to Mars like space XLike the moon, explorers on Mars would be able to harvest water, oxygen, and hydrogen from the permafrost and ice to serve as sources for water, oxygen, and fuel. The days on Mars are similar in length to days on earth, but the temperature is extremely cold, barely above the freezing point of water during the day and dropping drastically at night. Like the moon, the gravity is less so explorers would have to exercise daily to avoid muscular atrophy and loss of bone density. Mars has both water ice caps and dry ice/CO2 ice caps. The water ice caps stay consistent year round, but the dry ice caps fluctuate with the seasons and mostly evaporate in the summerFor Mars to become truly habitable, we would need to find a way to slowly heat the atmosphere so liquid water could flow on the surface, allowing for plants to grow outside of contained greenhouses. Terraforming mars is probably centuries away, and may be prohibitively costly. To artificially raise the temperature of the planet, we may inject water vapor and methane into the atmosphere to create a greenhouse effect, or send satellites into orbit over the ice caps to direct concentrated sunlight towards the caps to cause them to melt and release water vapor. Eventually, this warming process would become self-sustaining as well as increase the atmospheric pressure of mars. As plants grow and proliferate, dying plants will enrich the soil, and growing plants will add oxygen to the atmosphereMars cooled down slower than Earth did. Mars no longer has a molten core but rather a solid rock core, so it doesn’t have a magnetic field. This is one of the factors that accelerated Mars’s atmosphere loss. Also, the carbon dioxide is mostly trapped in the ground instead of proliferating in the atmosphere, causing a reverse greenhouse effectSome of the moons of the gas giants are also viewed as potential candidates for human coloniesThe gas giants are theorized to have a thick gaseous atmosphere, a cold liquid hydrogen ocean around the entire planet, and a small, solid hydrogen core because of the extreme pressures. Jupiter is surrounded by radiation, which causes Radio interference. The gravity of Jupiter actually helps protect the earth from being bombarded by astroids because it essentially serves as a vacuum cleanerTitan (a moon of Saturn) is a potential candidate for human colonization, but because it’s so far away it can’t have self-sustaining greenhouse effect, and the lakes of ethane Could combust if it got too hot. But it could be a source of fuel. And it’s one of the few places in our solar system where we would be able to go outside without a spacesuit because it has enough of an atmosphere that our blood wouldn’t boil/we wouldn’t be crushed (we’d still need an oxygen mask). Europa (a moon of Jupiter) has potential for microbial life in its ocean (which sits under the layer of ice that encircles the moon, and was made possible because of friction caused from the extreme tidal forces caused by Jupiter’s gravity)All the gas giants have rings, which are likely caused by moons that got too close to the planet being torn apart by the planet’s gravityTitan and the Kuiper belt would most likely serve as refueling stations or points from which to jump to the next star or planetGraphene/carbon nanotubes will likely be the material used to make infrastructure on other planets, because it’s immensely strong yet incredibly light. We’re not at a point yet where we can mass produce it, because even a small impurity can ruin it, but once we have the technology to do so, it’ll be the best material to use. It could even be used to create skin-tight, lightweight spacesuitsFor Interstellar and planetary colonization to be realistic, we would need automatons—robots with more intelligence than our current ones who can perform a wide variety of tasks such as building cities on planets and moons, which would be easier for a robot (doesn’t need a spacesuit, doesn’t get affected by radiation, isn’t limited by oxygen supply, etc)Getting robots to understand common sense has been extremely difficult and currently prevents them from fully perceiving and navigating the world. Currently robots need human intervention to do most tasks. Modern robots will likely be a combination of top down and bottom up learning; they will have some information already integrated into their systems but they will also have neural networks that will allow them to learn from repetition and gain common sense. Robots would also need to be self replicatingIon engines may make it possible for the trip to Mars to take 40 days rather than 9 monthsPotential energy sources for traveling at the speed of light include light sailing (propelling with lasers), nuclear energy (propelling with nuclear explosions), and antimatter energy. an antimatter rocket would have 100% energy efficiency, whereas nuclear explosion only has 1% because most of the Energy is wasted. However only a very small amount of anti-matter exists naturally, so we would have to manufacture it (currently extremely expensive). Storing the antimatter would be difficult because it would have to be stored in a trap that suspends it in a magnetic field so it’s not able to touch the edges of the container; if it touch the edges it would destroy the containerSomething that would help make getting materials into space much easier and more economical is creating a space elevator that stretches from the surface of the earth out above our atmosphere. Scientists predict that it is theoretically possible to do so, possibly even by 2035, but we would need to find a way to make enough strong enough Materials for this to be feasible. Ideally pure carbon nanotubes would be used, but right now it would be difficult to make as much as would be neededTo travel faster than light at warp speed, we need to find a way to make vast quantities of negative matter or negative energy. We’ve been able to make small amounts of negative energy, but we are nowhere close to producing the amount needed to even consider developing warp drivesSuspended animation/cryogenic freezing to allow longer voyages without needing generations of people to live on a spaceship is currently not possible. While other animals are able to survive in suspended animation because of the levels of glucose in their blood which prevents their blood from freezing, the amount of sugar needed is too high for humansTelomeres are part of our chromosomes that get shorter with aging; when they get too short the cells can no longer divide. If we can prevent that shortening from happening, it would increase our life span because our cells would be able to divide and replicate themselves longer. However, cancer operates in the same way and is essentially immortal, so that would be a riskIf we were able to identify exactly what parts of our genetic make up contribute to aging, we could alter our genes to expand our life expectancyAging is thought to be the accumulation of errors in our genetic make up over time, so if we can prevent those errors from happening because of deteriorating cell replication then we can slow down the aging processIf we were able to somehow make ourselves inmortal, or drastically increase our life expectancy, then we would likely have to deal with extreme overpopulation eventually. Before the Industrial Revolution, the human population of the earth was 300 million or less. It has now grown to 7.5 billion and is anticipated to increase by 1 billion every 12 years. It is estimated that there will be 11.2 billion people on the earth by 2100. However, others argued that our increase in population is slowly going down and will stabilize before we reach a level of overpopulationA primate has never been cloned. If we come to the point where human cloning is possible, it is likely that only a small percentage of the population would do so. It is also speculated that eventually we will find ways to modify our genes or enhance our bodies through cybernetics, but we will likely not take it so far that we drastically modify our appearance. Modifications would likely be improvements to existing issues (ex: eyesight) or ways to improve our social standing, rather than becoming creatures with giant heads and huge eyes and skinny bodies. Our use of cybernetics would prevent us from evolving that drastically. If we were to disperse in colonies across the galaxy, our genetic makeup would remain within 0.1% difference between colonies (same as between humans currently)We may in the next century or so develop ways to laser port our consciousness across the galaxy so our physical bodies could remain in place while our consciousness is able to move at the speed of light to visit other places by being ported it into an avatarEarth like planets need to be accompanied by large gaseous Jupiter like planets to clear out incoming astroids. They also need to be accompanied by a larger moon to stabilize their spin and trajectoryThe drake equation attempts to estimate the probability that we will make contact with intelligent life forms; however there is still a lot of unknowns that prevent us from having an accurate assessment from this equationIf there are intelligent beings on other planets, we can’t assume that they communicate vocally the same way we do. They might communicate through pheromones like bugs, or sonar like batsIntelligent life will likely follow the laws of evolution. An intelligent species will likely be descended from predators, so it will have forward facing eyes. They will also likely have opposable thumbs or some type of grasping appendage. They will also have some form of languageKardishev scale of civilizations: A type 1 civilization (planetary) uses all the energy of the sunlight that falls on the planet. Type 2 civilization (stellar) uses all the energy it’s sun produces. A type 3 civilization (galactic) uses the energy of an entire galaxy. We are currently a type 0.7 civilization because we’re not using the full energy of all the sunlight shining on our planet. We are about a century or two away from becoming a full type 1, and possibly A few thousand years from becoming a type 2. We might not become type 3 for 100,000 years or even up to 1 million because it requires a level of interstellar travel that we’re nowhere close to having. The energy measurements for each type just means and equivalent amount of energy, it doesn’t mean you have to be getting all your energy from the sun. Each next level of civilization is between 10 to 100 billion times more powerful than the previous typeA civilization that has reached type 2 is likely nearly immortal, and most of its energy generating machinery will likely be placed off planet because there will be so much energy being produced that it creates too much heat for the planet to be habitable. They will likely also harvest energy from their sun through a Dyson sphere and because of the vast quantities they are harvesting Will emit infrared radiationThere is another scale of civilization that is calculated based on the amount of information it consumes as proposed by Carl Sagan. Type A civilization consumes 1,000,000 bits of information. Type Z civilization consumes a 10^31 bits of information. We are a type H civilization. By this scale a type two civilization would be able to consume energy through widely distributed Dyson sphere, harvesting from astroids, developing super efficient nano technology, etc. and avoid giving up the levels of infrared radiation that would make it detectable to usOur first encounter with alien civilization will likely be a robotic self replicating probeString theory exists in 10 dimensions. It cancels out quantum corrections, basically meaning it cancels out the fact that quantum things like electrons and protons are able to be in multiple places at once. This quantum cancellation can only happen in 10 dimensions. The pairing for particles in string theory is sparticles, quarks are squarks, etc. String theory assumes an infinite number of universes (Multiverse). String theory says the universe was originally 10 dimensions, then for some reason the other 6 dimensions “curled up” leaving us with only 4 perceivable dimensionsDark matter was discovered because astrophysicist realized that the Milky Way was spinning 10 times faster than Newtonian physics would allow without flying apart, so they realize there must be some invisible thing adding all that extra mass to the galaxy. Dark matter is invisible, but it bends starlight so we’re able to detect it that way. Dark matter has gravity, but can’t be held/interact with matter in any way. It’s electrically neutral and only interacts with gravity. However we’ve never been able to officially prove that dark matter exist yet or create it ourselves in any way. Once we do, it will prove string theoryString theory is the only way would be able to do calculations about the quantum corrections needed for time travel, going through a wormhole, faster than light travel, etcThe universe is expected to eventually end in 1 of 3 ways: the big crunch, the big freeze, or the big rip. The big crunch is when the expansion of the universe slow down, stops, and reverses itself, eventually coalescing in a giant wad of superheated matter and possibly eventually turning into another big bang. For the big freeze, by the laws of entropy eventually the stars will stop shining, the sky will go black and temperature will reach absolute zero wherein matter nearly ceases to move. The big rip refers to the fact that the universe is exponentially expanding far faster than anticipated, and that distant galaxies will eventually speed away from us faster than the speed of light and disappear. Eventually our galaxy and solar system would be torn apart from this rapid expansion. The universe would end in an explosion, a singularity of infinite energyOur sun will exhaust its energy in about 5 billion years; it will expand into a red giant star which will essentially set the earth on fire, mountains will melt, oceans will boil, and the earth will be engulfed. After this, the sun will exhaust all its nuclear fuel and shrink and go cold as a white dwarf and then die as a dark dwarf star. In 4.8 billion years, the Milky Way and Andromeda galaxy’s will collide. There are two black holes will collide and merge and a new galaxy will eventually be formedDark energy is the energy of a vacuum. It acts like antigravity, and it pushes the universe apart. It is different than dark matter. The more the universe expands, the more dark energy there is, which makes the universe expand faster. About 69% of the matter/energy in the universe is contained in dark energy. Dark matter makes up 26%. Atoms of hydrogen and helium make up about 5%. And other higher elements that make up the earth, our bodies, etc. only make up 0.5%A possible way to overcome the eventual death of our universe is by becoming a type 4 civilization that harnesses extragalactic energy like dark energy and is able to reverse the big rip by creating a sphere in which dark energy reverses polarity so that inside the sphere The galaxies continue to survive normally while outside the sphere the universe is continuing to expand rapidly and tear itself apart. Another possible solution is that we find a way to leave our universe and go to one of the other theoretical bubble universes in the Multiverse. They could use negative energy to create a wormhole. The bubble universes are floating in a 10 dimensional arena—Read for the Astronomy prompt for the 2019 OWLs Readathon"

The second reason for listening twice is that it is chock full of info that is easy to miss in an audio format - so I also downloaded the Kindle version...I love Michio Kaku’s books. This one is about fun science of the future. Space travel - where are we, what do we still need to do, where would we go, how would we need to alter ourselves for outer space, what spacecrafts would we use, etc. Fun stuff, all told in an approachable, interesting story format. Kaku loves science fiction and peppers the narrative with movie and book references. Interestingly enough, he judges most of it more science and less fiction. Kaku is a physics professor, thus the physics are very solid; but I have my doubts on some of the biotechnology parts. Nevertheless, a thoroughly enjoyable book that I ended up listening to within about a day."
274,0241304849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8686546-feyzan---the-raven-boy,3,"3.5 starsthe journey of a thousand miles begins with the first stepI don't know what I was thinking when I picked this book up. I don't usually like to read books that are dense with physics and cosmology, but I admire michio kaku so i had to give this one a try. I am not surprised to feel disappointed, however. This book was pretty good on entertainment, and I understand why nerds would love it, but it did nothing for me, except maybe entertain a little. I couldn't take this book seriously as it was brimming with speculations about things that may or may not happen in next 5 billion years. I mean instead of worrying about what will happen in 5 billion years shouldn't we focus on saving our planet from all the man made chaos?I enjoyed the science fiction elements and reading about how tenaciously scientists are trying to make science fiction a new reality for humanity. It was all very interesting to read. The book covered many topics like terraforming, multi-verse, robotics, transhumanism. All these heavy and dense topic were easier to grasp and understand thanks to michio kaku's writing style and movie references. It feels like a new war is in order between the richest people of the world as they compete to colonize Mars and the universe itself. I think these rich people, Instead of spending billions of dollars on space exploration and planning to colonize other planets, should spend some of their foturne and influence to make this planet safe for everyone, Just saying. When I was a kid I used to dream about meeting aliens, going on a mission to space and whatnot. My imaginations used to very elaborated,  I used to imagine alines and robots in a very fanciful way. Robots used to have chips inside of them that could shut them off, if they tried to take over the world. Then I grew up. However, reading this book made me realize that some people are incapable of growing up.
 When self-aware robots do arrive, we must add a fail-safe chip that will shut them off if they have murderous thoughts.
I mean, first of all, no self aware robot is arriving anytime soon. Second of all, no self-aware robot will insert a chip inside of itself (I forgot to mention these robots are supposed to be self-replicating too.) Anyway, you get the idea this book is high on speculation and overflowing with head-scratching logic.
In 2017, a controversy arose between two billionaires, Mark Zuckerberg, founder of Facebook, and Elon Musk of SpaceX and Tesla. Zuckerberg maintained that artificial intelligence was a great generator of wealth and prosperity that will enrich all of society. Musk, however, took a much darker view and stated that AI actually posed an existential risk to all of humanity, that one day our creations may turn on us.
Wow, this exactly what we needed to be discussing right now. 🙄 Zuckerbergs' first concern should be to be make Facebook safe and secure again, not this. And then this book celebrate psychotic maniacs and call them heroes. 
 He confided to me that he takes several hundred pills a day, anticipating his own immortality
I guess, this book isn't meant to be taken seriously. It's just good to get inside the heads of scientists and learn how they operate and how they see the future. This book has imbued me with unnecessary knowledge that I don't know where and how to use. This knowledge is increasing my, already soaring, existential angst that wont rest until I use this knowledge somewhere. Anyway, this book isn't bad. It just wasn't for me. I am sure nerds and Sci-fi fans will love it."
275,0241304849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/77527711-j-c-ahmed,5,"The Future of Humanity, as the title suggests, makes predictions about humanity's future. Kaku addresses the possibilities of setting up permanent bases on the moon and terraforming Mars. At some point, humanity will need to move beyond the solar system to settle planets revolving around nearby stars. He also addresses genetic changes people may undergo, how humans will begin to merge with AI/machines, and ways immortality may become possible. It's fascinating stuff that should please both science and sci-fi fans."
276,0241304849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48491730-diego,5,"This was such an interesting book. It really normalizes the thoughts of leaving Earth and not only exploring beyond, but settling beyond. Even crazier notions of removing our minds from our bodies to travel via laser beams to the exterior of our galaxy into exoskeletons waiting for us is explored. And logically. I recommend this book just for the sake of expanding your thoughts on outer space and the future of where humankind may end up."

Off course It was a pleasant experience because it get me acquainted with a world which I was unfamiliar with. Reading "" The future of humanity"", I thought about many serious subjects and my mind was blowing up with interesting informations about almost everything. From space to physics theories, everything was explained in simple words and that was the beauty of this book. Reading this book gives you a clear insight about the future of us as humans and discusses several probable possibilities in the long life span of humankind during his/her adventure in the space. I recommend those who are new to this genre, to read this work as their first experience, and I promise that it will be their best first experience!📚😊"
279,0241304849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7258380-dan-graser,4,"In his latest work, physicist Michio Kaku has focused on the what the future life of humanity might be as pertains to several possible scenarios. Throughout the work he mostly does a decent job of suggesting how plausible these ideas are, or at the very least, the type of timeframe needed to develop the requisite technological capabilities to achieve them. Beginning with the colonization of Mars, Kaku does a fine job of explaining just how this very popular notion would have to work, the costs involved, where our current capabilities stand, and just who is at the forefront of this quest. As NASA continues to be underfunded, though they do have a Mars program in operation, private funding has taken over much of this territory and the competition created by these developments is changing just how (some, particularly wealthy) humans may leave this planet for good.Next Kaku takes up the idea of interstellar travel. This is one area where the type of technology required is hundreds of years away. This distances to other star systems is staggering, our technology still primitive, and the pace at which we could develop any sort of device traveling remotely close to the speed of light is very difficult to predict. Some hugely interesting ideas are posited but he is quick to note that many of these are at the moment very unrealistic.The intersection of AI and humanity is discussed but not in particularly great detail. I would recommend Max Tegmark on this subject as his picture is a bit more complete. Anyone who has read the literature on this likely already has a more thorough understanding than is presented in this section.Finally and perhaps most significantly, Kaku details what physics tells us about the end of space and time and the possibility to forestall these dire (though billions of years in the future) events with technology developed to harness the gravitational effect of dark matter and dark energy. As we still have no idea as to the workings of either of these this is of course purely speculative but this is the first I've heard of these compelling ideas. As with all of his books, Kaku is an engaging and accessible writer that only occasionally veers into oversimplification or inclusion of ideas purely for their mass appeal, not for their plausibility. This is an effective summary of where we are as pertains to the possible routes humanity might take to ensure, at the level of our entire species, our survival. Wonderful reading all around."

Unlike pessimists like Harari who fear human life becoming meaningless by advances in AI, he imagines using progresses in technology to settle and terraform Mars and elsewhere ! The first section which focuses on near future technologies and space travel was an absolute delight.Also, his vision is not limited to the next decade or 20 years, he also talks about possibilities in the next 100 and 1000 years and even later. Except for the last chapters on wormholes and time-travel which felt weird, enjoyed this joyride. A bit like a spiritual guru the author was expanding my mind’s horizons with his thought-experiments.Will be reading more by this author."

It wasn’t a mind-blowing read, though, as the majority of what he talks about has been mentioned in plenty of other non-fiction books out there. However, I won’t penalize the book for introducing themes I happened to be already familiar with. Some physics stuff I found hard to follow but this could be due to the fact, I was listening to it as an audiobook. Some reviewers complained about the onslaught of the pop culture references but I enjoyed them and think they were pretty well incorporated into the text.

290,0241304849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6991670-bob,4,"Summary: An exploration of the possibility and necessity of humanity becoming a multi-planetary species, and the revolutions of technology necessary to realize that future.Michio Kaku is a theoretical theorist studying string theory at the City University of New York, and the author of a series of best-selling futurist works based on his knowledge of physics and other fields. He is also a riveting, passionate speaker who believes, along with others like Elon Musk, that we must envision becoming a multi-planetary species. This, the latest of his books, explores that idea, it's necessity, and the technological advances that could make this possible.Kaku argument for the necessity of becoming a multi-planetary species is rooted in the priority of the survival of the human species. He is convinced that, whether through physical causes ranging from cataclysmic volcanoes to asteroids or the final death throes of the sun, our planet will become unlivable for human beings--if we do not accomplish this first through human causation as in nuclear holocaust or global warming. Discussing other great challenges we've faced through history, he writes:But now we face perhaps the greatest challenge of all: to leave the confines of the Earth and soar into outer space. The laws of physics are clear; sooner or later we will face global crises that threaten our very existence. (p.6)In three parts he explores the technologies that can make this possible. The first part explores interplanetary settlement efforts within our solar system, using moon as a base, and Mars as our first settlement, and later possibly settling, or exploiting the resources of the large moons orbiting the gas giants of Jupiter and Saturn. He describes existing efforts by public and private enterprise to return to the moon and create settlements on Mars. This itself is formidable considering exposures to radioactivity and the inhospitable nature of the planet but he argues for the eventual possibility of terra-forming Mars, making it livable and life sustaining. What is fascinating is that much of this is possible by applying and extending our current technology, albeit at great cost.The second part of the book seemed like something out of Star Trek, exploring the technologies of interstellar travel. All of this is beyond our current technologies. As a physicist, he takes us on a tour of possible technologies from nanoships and laser and solar sail propelled vehicles, to ramjet fusion and antimatter engines, and proposes that the warp drive of The Enterprise is possible, and consists not in propelling one faster than light, but literally warping space so that a vessel is pulled through it at hyper light speeds. Nearly all of this requires inordinately great quantities of energy, and presupposes a level of civilization at which we harness, first the energies of the sun, and than galactic levels of energy. This will allow us to explore at least the nearby stars or further into a galaxy of stars where it is increasingly evident that there are many possible habitable planets.The third part explores the reality that the great distances to be traveled, even should we exceed the speed of light, either require multi-generational crews, or advances toward immortality. He explores research on curing aging, on trans-humanism in which humans and machines become increasingly integrated. He discusses the Human Connectome Project, in which human neural networks are mapped, digitized, and potentially could be reproduced light years away, transmitted via laser networks. He also speculates on the existence of other more advanced civilizations. He mentions observations of recurring drops in energy output of star KIC 8462852 by as much as 30 percent positing an object 22 times as large as Jupiter, speculating that one possibility would be a megastructure like a Dyson sphere constructed by an alien civilization.This part also gets into Kaku's area of theoretical physics, string theory, as he explores the possibility of travel through wormholes and stargates and perhaps even escaping the present universe into one of many multiverses, particularly useful when this one burns out.Whew! Kaku's tour of the technologies necessary for interstellar travel is both breathtaking, and staggering. On one hand, much of the technology we use today, even that I am using as I write, was science fiction in my childhood. It is always dangerous to scoff at what seems impossible. The cell phone at my side represents applications of theoretical physics unknown 150 years ago in terms of the miniaturized circuitry and memory, cellular and wi-fi capabilities, GPS tracking, and touch screens. What would have been an object of wonder 150 years ago is now a commonplace of many of our lives. Yet what Kaku describes in this book, particularly in parts two and three, strings together ventures of immense cost, requiring unimaginable amounts of power, huge quantities of rare (and dangerous) resources like anti-matter, as well as scenarios, the survivability of which are in question, all of which to preserve the human species on a multi-planetary scale. Of course Kaku allows millenia for reaching such capabilities.The most credible part of the book for me was the near-term ideas of travel to Mars, perhaps even establishing some form of outpost there. If something of a cataclysmic nature were to occur on Earth in the next couple centuries, such an outpost might preserve civilization, and even re-settle earth. Even this is tremendously costly as well as risky. We must expect lives to be lost, even as they were among other explorers and settlers throughout our history. But it also raised questions of several sorts.Some were questions of priority. Should we think of terra-forming Mars when our own planet's earth, water and air need so much attention? Should we pour huge funds and inordinate amounts of energy into space travel when transport on earth is still carbon-based and polluting? When we are not yet addressing preventable diseases of childhood, and providing quality and affordable health care on a global basis, is it right to pour huge amounts into life-extending technologies that may benefit a select few? Or even as we think about planetary defense, might we focus on technologies for detection and destruction of planet-threatening objects from outer space? All this falls under the question of caring for the planet and people that we have before we think about settling other worlds.Some are more fundamental questions having to do with whether we ought to do these things. I think of this particularly around the discussion of immortality. Kaku fails to deal with the issue of whether it is a good thing for humans with our flawed as well as noble nature to live for ever. Have you ever noticed how, as people age, they become who they always were, to an even greater degree? We may grow both more loving and more neurotic. We may grow more knowledgeable and more petty. The closest he gets to this is when he quotes the late Stephen Hawking who said, ""We only have to look at ourselves to see how intelligent life might develop into something we wouldn't want to meet."" In my own faith tradition, we believe that it is a severe mercy of God that flawed and fallen people don't live endlessly in our bodies and that hope is found not in endless mortal life, but life everlasting beyond bodily death.Finally, I am troubled with the hubristic strains that carry as much attraction for many contemporary hearers as they did for the first couple in the garden, and the tower builders of Babel. Kaku writes:...our destiny is to become the gods we once feared and worshipped. Science will give us the means by which we can shape the universe in our image. The question is whether we will have the wisdom of Solomon to accompany this vast celestial power. (p. 14)""You shall be as gods"" has been a temptation from the very beginning, and is one this book proffers to its readers. Along with that temptation comes tower-building (or space elevator) projects that reflect our pitiful efforts to offset our creaturely vulnerabilities. Will we exchange dependence on the sustenance of the Creator and responsible care for the world we've been given for anxious and costly efforts to preserve ourselves in other worlds, and perhaps neglect the most vulnerable on our own planet? I find the reference to Solomon fascinating, because the record tells us that, while wise, he abandoned the fear of God which is the beginning of wisdom, giving himself to building projects that taxed and enslaved, and that he multiplied wives and experiences. If Ecclesiastes gives us the final verdict on this project, it is all summed up as ""meaningless,"" ""a chasing after the wind,"" and that ""with much wisdom comes much sorrow."" It seems that this is what always comes of trying to make ourselves gods, and trying to stave off death when a universe of wonder and a world of beauty to be cared for beckons us to trust its Maker."

The first and foremost thought I had while reading this book was how shockingly poor my knowledge in astronomy was. The book covers a vast variety of concepts pertaining to universe, space travel, relativity, quantum theory, time travel and other likes written in a lucid fashion."
292,0241304849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1639329-erik,2,"A mile wide, an inch deep. It's simple to the point of being erroneous: He'll spend a single sentence glossing over a profound problem that'll take billions of manhours to resolve. Not to mention some truly stupid claims in here, such as his belief that only human beings (as opposed to other animals) possess an awareness of time. That's incorrect by inspection.And worse - it's boring. It feels less like ""The Future of Humanity"" and more like ""Cliffnotes of the Future of Humanity."" You would be vastly better served reading a science fiction book that explores these ideas of interstellar travel, generation arks, AI, etc. The Martian; The Expanse; etc, etc.BUT one major positive is just how much research this book inspired me into. It has a lot of references to real and underway projects. Following up on these was both fun and informative."
293,0241304849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22189980-belhor,3,"Interesting enough. Kaku is easy to read and I love the fact that he always quotes lots of interesting people in his writing. This book is the second book from Kaku that I've read, and even though I liked his ""Parallel Worlds"" more, this one is also a pretty decent book. I would have liked if he went through a little more details specially in the first chapters. The book gets better when you are almost halfway through."
294,0241304849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21091961-jacques-bezuidenhout,3,"Nice, easy to follow explanation of scientific concepts, and how humans are likely to evolve in future.I might have given the book a higher rating if I didn't already touch on most of the concepts discussed in other books:The Space Barons: Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, and the Quest to Colonize the CosmosHomo Deus: A Brief History of TomorrowA Short History of Nearly EverythingThere is quite a bit of overlap.This book is a nice summary putting the relevant information together and sequencing them chronologically.This book is also fairly new. So some of the facts contained goes up to things happening in 2017, which is nice.The latter part of the book touching on quantum and string theory, starts going over one's head a bit. Although explained as simple as possible, it does become a bit difficult to follow in audio format. You also need to be really open minded to get your head around some of the concepts / possibilities presented for the future. Since most are speculative, and mostly relies on things humans aren't even close to achieving."
295,0241304849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/93786551-nirali-lakdawala,4,"Its an amazing book and it takes you to space and beyond. The concepts are well explained & the way michio kaku talks about universe, the different ways to travel distance and the way we as a civilization will evolve is just superb."
296,0241304849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60980219-catherine-cole,5,"Although scientists might think the explanations given to the topics in this book may be a little too ""dumbed-down"" for their liking, they must remember that this book is for general audiences, who may not have the same knowledge or vocabulary as they do, therefore, simple explanations and comparisons to situations the non-scientific population can understand are necessary.This book takes you on a journey from the very first notions of rockets to hypothetic scenarios where you can transport your consciousness in laser beams to planets beyond our galaxy, and even escape the end of this universe.Many fascinating theories for space travel, building stations and ports in moons and asteroids, modifying our bodies to adapt to a non-planetary existence, and the different types of civilizations we might become, make this an eye/mind-opening read. Plus, it is a treasure chest of ideas for science fiction writers, who do not have the limitations of time or budget to make new realities come true on a page."
297,0241304849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73029907-cav,5,"This was an exceptionally well-formatted and written book. I really enjoyed it. This is my first from author Michio Kaku, but won't be my last.Kaku writes with a very engaging style, that holds the reader's attention effortlessly. This is a welcome change to many, many other science books I have read that are plagued by long-winded, esoteric and dry writing.The book is written in an easy-to-follow manner that would be suitable for the layperson who may be not too familiar with science. Kaku is an extremely effective science communicator; he takes complicated ideas, and conveys them in a simple and easy to understand manner. We need many more like him, IMHO.As mentioned, the book's formatting is excellent, as well. It is broken down into 3 main parts:
1) LEAVING THE EARTH2) VOYAGE TO THE STARS3) LIFE IN THE UNIVERSE
Which then break further down into different chapters. Kaku ends most chapters with a really natural segway to the upcoming one. The book has an excellent flow to it.If you were a fan of sci-fi as a kid, or are curious about what the future has in store for the human race, then this book is for you. The Future of Humanity covers (among many others): *The history of rockets; pioneers Goddard and von Braun.*Missions to the moon and Mars; the possibilities of living on either.*The asteroid belt, and possibilities of mining them.*The gas giants, Venus, Titan, and other moons.*Robotics, AI, and self-replicating robots.*Transhumanism*Spaceships; different theoretical technologies, and rocket types.*Black holes, wormholes, and spacetime.*The possibility of life on other worlds.*String theory and multiverses.I thoroughly enjoyed this book, and would most definitely recommend it to anyone interested in astronomy, physics, and the future of humanity in general. It is a big-picture book, with many incredible ideas that are sure to capture your imagination.5 stars, and a spot on my ""Favorites"" shelf."
298,0241304849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25338445-angie-reisetter,3,"Kaku is a great tour guide to the possibilities of the distant future. He imagines what may be possible, or at least what is not ruled out by the laws of physics as we know them. He has the tendency in this book, as he does in his others, to introduce topics with words like ""perhaps"" and ""might"", and then to drop them altogether, so that it sounds like he is telling us what will happen, casting aside minor difficulties like cost and human will. He threads science fiction references throughout his narrative, almost organizing his argument by what he's seen/read in science fiction. That's not a terrible way to go, but he also blurs the line of reality there, asking himself how we reconcile two different views of the future, as if they are not fictional and must be reconciled. The whole thing is very entertaining. But he has a theorist's tendency to discount reality, which is always my criticism of his work. But I did come back for more, and his work is always worth reading. A little inspiration is called for right about now.There seem to be a number of science futures becoming available in the near future, and I've recently read Soonish: Ten Emerging Technologies That'll Improve and/or Ruin Everything, which is very different from this one. I recommend them both as a study in contrasts: Kaku's extends to the limits of what might be possible one day maybe, and Soonish tries to keep it, well, soonish, in the realm of the reasonably possible. They have some topics in common, but they diverge rather dramatically.I got a copy to review from Net Galley."
299,0241304849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1667021-may-ling,5,"Summary: Well-Researched almost status update on where we are in creating the future a la sciene fiction.Short Vlog found at Instagram: WhereIsmayLing Youtube: Diary of a Speed Reader . I'd love it if you'd check me out and consider following/subscribing.You know, there is a crazy need that people have to judge a book by its title. It almost never is the case that that is what a book is on about. Perhaps a more accurate title would be: This is what Star Trek envisions and here's the status on where we're at. In that case, the book is amazing b/c it's quite hard to get that accomplished. If you look at the sea of references in the back and also read it, you'll realize how difficult it was to write something that is this comprehensive, albiet, much of detais of his reference are in the footnotes. p. 2 - He talks about the similarities between humans vs. chimps as a cohort a supposes that some cataclysmic event took out the genetic diversity that once was.p. 20 ""The amount of fuel you need reises exponentially with the change in velocity so that enormous amounts of fuel are needed to give an extra boost to speed."" (ok, a little wordy. What he's saying is it's hard to increasingly acceleration (that's what change in velocity is). You're going to need to accellorate for a while and at a crazy high speed if you want to leave earth for another planet. They are pretty far away.p. 32 - He deals with some of the politics and economics. He talks about it being easier to fund a person going into space vs program itself. As a result, many compromises (as that's more expensive to support life vs. just do unmanned missions).p. 33 - ""It takes $10k to put a pound of anything up in space.""p. 34 - The story of the great imperial fleet of Admiral Zheng 1405 - 1433. I really want to look thi up, b/c this was a big deal as relates to why there are Chinese people in specific places on the earth like Madagascar. Glad to finally get a citation. p. 40 Jules Verne's method of shooting someone to the moon predates rocket fuel. That's a major innovation. Blue Origin - company by Bezo's rocket system is called New ShepardElon Musk's Space X is called Falcon Rocket.p. 41Blue origin is billing it as a tourism voyage with an orientation.p. 43 Beso's vision: ""The whole idea is to perserve the Earth... The goal [is] to be able to evacuate humans. The planet would become a park."" All the waste would be ejected into space. In 2017 he announced his plans: ""Once considered a lonely outpost in space, the moon would become a bustling industrial and commercial hub with permanent manned bases and manufacturing."" p. 44 Moon Express plans on mining the moon.p. 45 The outer space treaty does not contain any language related to real estate ownership of the moon and it's annoying to many people to think of it.p. 47 - The book moves into the other tech that has to exist if you're legit going to go the moon. The first has to do with medical care. Robots need to get better for things like remote-controlled surgery. Similarly a lot more work has to go in withstanding radiation.p. 50 Talks about how the moon was formed through a huge impact billions of years ago. The Earth looked like packman and the Moon a slice. All that changed through gravity.p. 62 - Musk's company's vision to Mars...he's on track to try to send a manned mission to mars by 2024. Typically estimates have said it would cost betwen $400-500b. He's trying to do it for $10bln. He's trying to get the price down per ride to $200k so that it competes with Virgin's galactic SpaceShipTwo. There's also pricing for the Russian rocket International Space Station which is $20-40m. I never knew the price of this stuff. Nice.p. 67 The total failure (which is always fatal) of going into space is about 1.5% (3 failures out of 135) with the fatality count being about 3.3%. With mars, most satellites do not make it there (3/4ths do not).p. 85 - MDRS Mars Desert Research station attempts to make realistic situations to determine the psychological effects of being on MARS.p. 87 - Terraforming in terms of DNA. There is an idea that DNA came from Mars and transformed the earth. p. 93 - They believe that MARS lost its magnetic field (necessary to protect the planet) from heavy bombardment. It's why the core is solid vs. lava like ours.p. 94 - ""The Earth is larger than Mars, so it did not coll down as quickly. The Earth also did not suffer a collapse of its magnetic field caused by giant meteor impacts."" p. 99 - Some people want to break off a piece of Europa and bring it to mars to repopulate the planet with water.p. 103 - Titan has atmosphere and would actually support life, though we'd stll need a few other things. p. 116 - The use of AI to help explore the planets in preparation for human entrance. Or alternatively,we just move our organic body into a computer one so we can enjoy space travel.p. 118 - He introduces Neural Networks p. 121 - Self-replicating robots are necessary in space. this describes what they have to be like.p. 129 He has a theory that humans differ from animals b/c we notice time. I'm not 100% sure I agree. but ok.p. 156 HE talks about the challenge of stopping a rocket ship.p. 158 The space elevator is another option often tossed around.p. 169 Parallax. didn't know that word.p. 170 - Talks about how we find planets with minor dimming of light.p. 178 talks about rogue planets.p. 190 sets up for the idea that medical drives the ability of humans to expand into new territories.Solving aging (telemeers) is about allowing us to go to space.p. 204 Again putting you in a robot might work.p. 206 - They talk about the exoskeleton and where that's at.p. 211 - The chip in glasses to type out a sentence is early stage communication via just neural activity.p. 226- What if alliens are WAY ahead of us? p. 233 - It almost goes backward in talking about what makes Humans the best on earth. It's not b/c we are strong We are actually worthless in strengh and other characteristics.p. 248 A dyson sphere is created around a star to harness the energy that comes off of it.p. 258 They are looking for someone that has done this in the galaxy to see if some other species has left a big footprint like we have on earth. So far, no luck.p. 261 Talks about how DNA can demonstrate the rate of divergence/mutation. It's really slow. Weird would have thought it would be driven by the amount/speed of procreation. p. 323 A great reading list. I'd like to one day take a look at all of these books."
