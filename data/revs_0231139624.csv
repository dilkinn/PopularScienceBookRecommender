It happens every time a new germ invades your body, a new pest or weed destroys our crops, or a new insecticide-resistant fly or mosquito bites you. Creationists may get some personal comfort from their beliefs, but they cannot change the fact that life is evolving all around us and threatens our survival if we don’t come to terms with that evolution.” (p. 118)If the most profound truths are destined for the most polarizing receptions, then Darwin's ideas surely clinch the heavyweight title. From an empirical vantage point, the passage of time has been exceptionally kind to the iconic naturalist, even if scrupulously supported science is a poor solvent for cemented dogma. In some parts of the world, the mere mention of evolution can still elicit a range of reactions, from deep-seated animosity to a spluttering defiance waged from behind the ramparts of a keyboard. And yet for others it is an embodiment of the heightened grandeur science can evoke.One might think something so well established would not so thoroughly dichotomize public attitude, but this mystery is clarified by unboxing the countermovement’s religious underpinning. Evolution’s conflict with a literal exegesis of Genesis is not an insignificant problem for fundamentalists, who feel roused to stamp out this object of dissonance at every turn. In what has become de rigeur for many of these blocs, scientific perspectives are measured against the canons of church teaching rather than the other way around. Adaptation is selected by committee, not by nature. Combine this with man’s long-harbored fancies about our place in the cosmos and you have an idea ripe for naysaying.Charles Darwin himself might have identified with such sentiments early in his career. Like many of his contemporaries, he found little reason to doubt the literal truth of the Bible, having been raised in an Anglican family under the Church of England, the state-established Christian institution in Britain. By all tradition and probability, Darwin seemed destined to pursue a life of piety and vicarage. But his gaze was set on loftier pursuits. At the hale and nimble age of twenty-two, Darwin accepted consignment to the HMS Beagle and embarked on the famed Pacific voyage that would forever imprint his thinking and shift his worldview.His observations during this expedition were difficult to stomach initially. He noticed that animals on outlying oceanic islands like the Galápagos were nothing like those on the nearest mainland, and that the fossils left behind by extinct species shared a stronger resemblance to the local fauna than they did to continental fauna. From these initial whispers was spun a thesis for the ages: life on earth had adapted to the environment in which it found itself, with Nature the arbiter. So conscious was Darwin of the weighty implications of his newfound understanding that he sat on the concept of natural selection (or ""descent with modification,” as he preferred to call it) for more than twenty years before taking it public. Even absent the evidence that would best support his theory–the fossil record, still sparse at the time–and the field that would tie it all together–genetics–Darwin’s observations and insight were groundbreaking. More than one hundred and fifty years later, his landmark ideas tend to provoke the same animus as in the 1860s. No amount of corroboration seems sufficient to dissipate its detractors; evolutionary science is still disputed and rejected by the bulk of religious America, and by the global majority based on recent indicators. This is unfortunate, not just because it signals anti-intellectualism, but because biological evolution—our evolution—ranks among the most important discoveries in all of science. Its advent ushered in a far more intricate and, indeed, far less anthropocentric understanding of life over against the unquestioned orthodoxy of distinctly created ""kinds."" While there may always be holdouts who drum up controversy in a bid to undermine the science, there is no such controversy within the scientific community. Evolution: What the Fossils Say and Why It Matters, from reputable paleontologist of 30 years, Donald Prothero, illuminates both sides of this longstanding narrative. With his expertise in fossils and other inter-applicable disciplines, Prothero enlightens his readers on why the occurrence of evolution is part of the furniture of reality and shoots down the biblically motivated dismissals of creationists who deny this reality.First Things FirstBefore establishing the positive case for common descent, Prothero first targets the religious engines which fuel its nonacceptance, allocating considerable space to biblical origins and context. I cannot commend this approach enough. All of the evidence in the world is not enough to sway fortified religious mindsets. The ballast of fundamentalism must first be kicked aside.The forays into biblical interpretation are admirable and strike at the heart of creationism. Entire sections are devoted to precursory creation myths, such as those of the Sumerians and Babylonians, the Documentary Hypothesis, and debunking “flood geology.” As Prothero tells us, “The Bible is a composite of multiple sources that did not always agree with each other.” (p. 30) It is truly refreshing to see a scientist as capable of dissecting the often thorny issues of religion as of science, even though his treatment here is unlikely to break new ground for those well-versed in biblical studies.All roads lead back to America as the birthplace of modern creationism—from its evangelical roots in the late 19th century and the many spouts of obstructionist fervor in the courtroom to the appearance of its more recent cognate, intelligent design (ID). While most of these efforts to gain academic traction have collapsed in failure, there is a rich history to be told here of the rhapsodic and fitful yet ongoing quarrel over the legality of teaching creationist perspectives in public school systems around the country.Prothero recounts in places his own debates with creationists and the predictable tactics they employ to evade the portfolio of evidence unearthed by the scientific community. With devastating effectiveness, Prothero yanks the rug out from creationist and ID peddlers and pinpoints the errors in their tattered objections.Fossils Tell the StoryIn reconstructing the evolutionary history of life, scientists look to the strongest clues available: those written in the earth itself. As one of the most accomplished paleontologists of his generation, Prothero is in rare form with his dizzying knowledge of the fossil record. Unfortunately for scientists like Prothero, the discovery of a fossil is actually an overwhelmingly improbable event due to the unforgiving processes of fossilization and deposition, combined with the fact that few scientists are out there hunting for them. Indeed, a fossil record as robust as what we have today is a story in and of itself. He walks us through example after example of evolutionary sequences, highlighting transitional forms along the way as well as each taxon's overall place in the topiary of life.Our guided tour commences with the smallest of life on earth, the microbial forms of bacteria and protists whose relatively rapid evolution makes for an impressive array of microfossils. We next work our way up to invertebrates, and onto fish, and then proceed to the nonamniote tetrapods (what the rest of us might call amphibians). Next Prothero discusses the selection pressures giving rise to land-based animals’ return to the sea and the reptilian’s branching evolutionary tree leading to the dinosaurs and, later, birds. Priority then shifts to the mammals. Horse, rhino, pinniped (seals, sea lions and walruses) and whale evolution are among the most remarkable examples in science of later observation confirming prediction.The book concludes with a recap of our own origins. Some 6,000 hominid fossils have been located to date, and biologists have made significant progress in piecing together the complete canvas of human evolution. The various collections preserved by museums around the world document our ancestry in near-cinematic form. Upon Prothero's first visit to the natural history museum in Kenya, he reminisces: ""A tour through the bomb-proof hominid vault in the Kenya National Museum in Nairobi is a revelation: a whole room full of fossils that document our evolution, and whose existence the creationists must deny.” (p. 336)Of all the threads of evidence buttressing Darwin’s original insight, the fossil record qualifies as perhaps the most irrefutable testament to the temporal progression from simpler organisms to more complex organisms. The variety presented here reaches a scale and lucidity few other works can match. While Prothero marshals independent corroboration from other disciplines, including embryology, vestigiality, comparative genomics and biogeography, the punch line of the book is the none too shabby fossil record, which only grows more exhaustive with each passing year.On a somewhat picky note, I do wish Prothero had mentioned one of the primary objections to fossil science: the reconstruction of a full specimen from a small number of bones. As paleontologists will emphasize, you do not need a complete set of bones to extrapolate with accuracy a full skeleton. For example, the human body is comprised of 206 bones, but many of those are redundant. If the left tibia bone is intact, the right tibia is unnecessary. Once you account for all the duplicate bones, you're left with around 120 unique fragments. Moreover, certain bones constitute defining features for certain genera, relegating others to a lower priority. This is important because rarely is a full set found in the wild.Slaying the SlainIf a knock can be made against the book, it is Prothero's relentless captivation with creationists, especially Duane Gish, whom Prothero has debated multiple times in public. In fact certain portions of the book seem almost entirely addressed to a creationist—a boxing match that never seems to let up. At some point it began to feel a bit repetitive, and could potentially turn off the very readers he's trying to reach. I get it, though: he's spent much of his life wrangling with creationists; it's only inevitable this would manifest on the page.Closing ThoughtsAfter the last page had been turned, I couldn’t help but feel once more a sense of awe at the diversity of life that has roamed this planet and the time-tested principles that account for it. I find endlessly perplexing the fundamentalist’s continued preoccupation with ancient creation stories when life’s evolutionary past is ever more breathtaking, ever more nuanced, and ever more surreal juxtaposed with the prosaic passages introducing the biblical texts. Prothero lays down an airtight case, premised on a voluminous amount of empirical evidence, for the truth of the former and against the fallaciousness of the latter. Part textbook, part creationist’s worst nightmare, Evolution: What the Fossils Say and Why It Matters is one of the most accessible resources on the topic I’ve had the pleasure of reading. It answered the most questions, and may well be the go-to reference for debunking pestersome creationists. Highly recommended.Note: This review is republished from my official website.

1,0231139624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3038974-steve-van-slyke,4,"It's my own fault that I did not read the book description or the other reviews here closer. I didn't get the impression from the book description that so much of it would be devoted to countering the fallacious arguments of the creationist-ID crowd. Not expecting that, and not one needing to be convinced, I was a little annoyed at all the time and ink spent describing and shooting down the creationist positions. For those who need a little more convincing, or who regularly debate creationists, those parts of the book would be quite valuable. It is for these reasons that I gave the book four rather than five stars.Nevertheless, it does a good job of describing most of the evolutionary pathways from simple bacteria to various megafauna including dinosaurs, birds, whales, and humans. My only other regret that once he takes the reader on to land with the “amphibians,” that he forgets plants and insects, but I understand that author's have to make choices because of marketing constraints. His frequent references to systematics and cladistics made me want to read a book specifically on that topic.So, again, if you are looking for a book on evolution that specifically takes on the creationist and Intelligent Design community, you could do no better than to start here.NOTE TO KINDLE READERS: GoodReads does not at the time of this writing show the availability of the Kindle edition, which is what I read. If I had to do it again I would buy the hardback. There are many cladograms and other illustrations, including color plates. Some these ""zoomed"" well enough to appreciate while others did not and required the use of a magnifying glass. Also, the Kindle version was expensive, close to $15."
2,0231139624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2209582-ross,3,"This is a very scholarly book, equivalent to a university level text covering an overview of the origin of life on Earth. It has been written as a definitive rebuttal to the assertions of creationists who believe that the bible book of Genesis is literally true. The author has debated Creationists over many decades and this work is also an autobiographical account of his absolute frustration that his opponents simply won't accept facts. The book would serve as a wonderful text book for an Evangelical college on the subject of evolution. Of course, it will never be put to such a use.For the general reader who is interested in Darwin's ""dangerous idea"" on the origin of species and the history of life on Earth, this work is a very good source. I should again emphasize that this means really, really interested as more to the point because of the detailed presentation of this book.Out of curiosity I just checked the Gallup poll and found that the belief of Americans in ""Young Earth Creationism"" has now fallen to about 15 percent. Darwin is finally winning.Read again in 2018. For prospective readers I give this book 4 stars for it's excellent overview of the history of life and 2 stars for the time wasted on fighting creationists, resulting in the average of 3 stars for the overall rating."
3,0231139624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7231894-chris-branch,4,"I sincerely hope that I never again read or hear an argument against the truth of evolution based on the lack of transitional fossils - or so-called ""missing links"" - from anyone who hasn't read this book. Prothero describes dozens of transitional fossils here - and to be extremely generous in giving creationists the benefit of the doubt, many of these have been discovered and/or documented in the past 20 to 30 years, so anyone who relies on data older than that will find some gaps. But that is emphatically no longer the case; the entire history of life is covered here, and among the fossils described are those that show transitions between:- worm-like invertebrates and fish-like vertebrates- fish and tetrapods- amphibians and amniotes- dinosaurs and birds- reptilian synapsids and mammals - terrestrial mammals and marine mammals such as seals, sea lions and walruses- proto-ungulates and horses, artiodactyls, and whales- elephant-like tethytheres and sirenians- primates and australopithecines and eventually humansSo this book is certainly worth reading just for chapters 7 through 15, where these transitional forms are covered in depth.Prothero also spends a lot of time attacking creationists for their dishonesty when it comes to matters of science, which is certainly a valid and worthy endeavor, but this makes for some tedious reading, especially if you're already familiar with the arguments on both sides (or if you're a creationist).Given this agenda, the author has also included plenty of other material that's a bit peripheral to the central subject of fossils, including the nature of science compared to creationism and intelligent design, a debunking of the absurd concept of ""flood geology"" (!) and a discussion of mechanisms other than natural selection that also contribute to evolution. The categorization of species is covered in the subjects of systematics and cladistics, and there is a chapter regarding theories on the origin of life.It would be fantastic if readers who've been taught creationism and are curious about evolution would read this book, but if this is their initial exposure to the subject, I would guess it's unlikely they'll make it through. So, as a brief introduction to evolution and natural selection, I highly recommend River Out of Eden: A Darwinian View of Life by Richard Dawkins. For a more concise presentation of the evidence for evolution, I recommend Jerry A. Coyne's Why Evolution Is True. And for those who are looking for the exhaustive history of life on earth, it's covered here in a rather textbook-like way; for a more engagingly written account I would suggest Dawkins' The Ancestor's Tale: A Pilgrimage to the Dawn of Evolution."
4,0231139624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7324264-john,5,"""Evolution: What the Fossils Say and Why It Matters"" is the best book I have ever read emphasizing the importance of the fossil record as the indisputable ""facts"" of biological evolution, documenting the history of life on Planet Earth. Its publication is long overdue, and yet, remains quite timely, when major publishers like Simon and Schuster have mistakenly published sterling examples of mendacious intellectual pornography like Michael Behe's ""The Edge of Evolution"". Indeed, Prothero's book ought to be viewed as the one that demolishes forever, Behe's inane assertion that the fossil record is irrelevant, claiming that the ""truth"" will be found only at the molecular level (More than anything else, that terse comment from Behe merely demonstrates his profound ignorance and understanding of the fossil record. Incidentally, Prothero refers to Behe as an ""Intelligent Design creationist"".). It also demonstrates the absurdity of creationist claims from the likes of Behe's Discovery Institute colleagues Paul Nelson, Jonathan Wells, and Geoffrey Simmons, among others, that the fossil record does not have ""transitional forms"". Indeed, as Prothero clearly shows his readers again and again, the history of life on our planet is replete with ""transitional forms"" documenting the evolutionary transitions from fish to tetrapods, from terrestrial carnivorous dinosaurs to flying birds, from primitive ungulate mammals to whales, and from apes to mankind. He also stresses the relevance of the fossil record to other aspects of evolutionary biology, noting its relevance with respect to molecular - as well as comparative anatomical - data. All of this is told in clear, concise, and persuasive, prose that often reaches the same literary heights attained by Prothero's mentor and friend, the late Stephen Jay Gould; without question this splendid book ought to be regarded as among the finest published last year. Prothero's book is also a superb guide to the history and - regrettably - ever-present danger posed by Intelligent Design advocates and other creationists. The first three chapters emphasize the profound intellectual differences between valid mainstream science like contemporary evolutionary biology and pseudoscientific religious nonsense like ""scientific"" creationism in all of its flavors, especially Intelligent Design. Prothero offers a detailed look at the scientific method in the very first chapter, comparing and contrasting it with creationism (He also provides a superb introductory guide too to the writing of the Judeo-Christian Old Testament.). The second chapter is an in-depth exploration of creationism, tracing its roots in early 20th Century American Fundamentalist Protestant Christianity, and, of course, describing the emergence of Intelligent Design and its zealous promotion by the Discovery Institute, the Seattle, Washington-based ""conservative"" think tank (However, much to my amazement, he does not emphasize sufficiently, the important work done by philosopher of science Barbara Forrest and biologist Paul Gross in their book ""Creationism's Trojan Horse: The Wedge of Intelligent Design"" in exposing the Discovery Institute's crypto-Fascist agenda for a future United States. Yet, to his credit, he does acknowledge that agenda by referring to its infamous ""Wedge Document"" while noting the Discovery Institute's deceitful promotion of Intelligent Design at the expense of valid mainstream science like contemporary evolutionary biology.). Finally, in Chapter Three, Prothero exposes both the intellectual inanity of ""Flood Geology"" and the popular creationist pastime of ""quote mining""; the latter, a practice that's still popular with Discovery Institute Senior Fellows Michael Behe, William Dembski and Jonathan Wells. The next two chapters comprise an excellent introduction to the history and science of evolutionary biology and the theory and practice of cladistic systematics. In Chapter Four, Prothero discusses the history of evolutionary biology, tracing its intellectual roots from the ancient Greeks to Lamarck, Darwin, and those biologists who became the ""architects"" of the Modern Synthesis Theory of Evolution (also known as the so-called ""Neo-Darwinian Synthesis"", since it merged population genetics with paleontology, biogeography, ecology and systematics). He also discusses some of the current controversies in contemporary evolutionary biology, beginning with evolutionary developmentaly biology, better known as ""Evo - Devo"", and, ending, of course, with punctuated equilibrium, noting how often it has been twisted and bent out of shape by creationists of all stripes, who have excelled only in ""quote mining"" from the published scientific and popular publications written by Stephen Jay Gould and Niles Eldredge; the two American invertebrate paleobiologists responsible for ""punk eke"". In Chapter Five, Prothero offers an especially lucid account of the theory and history of cladistic systematics, emphasizing its importance as a tool for studying both Earth's current biodiversity and its history of life. In ""Part II Evolution? The Fossils Say YES!"", Prothero gives us a whirlwind tour of the history of life on Planet Earth, emphasizing major episodes in the history of life on Planet Earth, beginning with the origin of life, and culminating with the emergence of mankind. In Chapter Six, Prothero offers clear, persuasive evidence for the relative ease in creating life from inert organic compounds, brushing aside creationist arguments to the contrary. He debunks the outdated notion of a ""Cambrian Explosion"" - which remains popular with creationists, including Intelligent Design advocates - in Chapter 7, observing that the fossil record points to instead, a ""Cambrian Slow Fuse"", involving the gradual diversification of hard-part skeletonized fauna over the span of eighty million years, from the Late Precambrian through early Ordovician. He discusses the emergence of tetrapods from limbless fish in Chapter 10, the rise of early amniotes (which includes the reptiles, birds and mammals) in Chapter 11, and the evolution of flight in avian dinosaurs in Chapter 12, demonstrating the existence of countless ""transitional forms"". Further chapters are devoted to the origin of whales (Chapter 14) and humans (Chapter 15), and thus, offer a terse, but still thorough, glimpse, at the history of life on this planet. Prothero's coverage is so superb, that I am surprised by his all too brief references to mass extinctions, especially when their very existence ought to raise ample questions about an Intelligent Designer and his ability to ""design"" life that is extinction resistant. In the final chapter of his book (Chapter 16), Prothero makes a truly compelling argument explaining why creationism is a clear and present danger, not only to American education, but indeed, the very survival of the United States too. He quotes from an extended excerpt from the Los Angeles Times, describing creationist Ken Ham's indoctrination of young school children against evolution, conjuring up - at least for me - an image of Adolf Hitler's infamous Nuremberg Nazi Party rallies. He blames the advent of creationism since the late 1950s for fostering scientific illiteracy among Americans, and noting that this threatens our future economic success as we compete with other, better educated, countries like those in Europe and East Asia in a global economy increasingly dominated by science and technology. He also argues persuasively that denial of evolution is harmful to our health and well being, graphically illustrating this point by reminding us of the unsuccessful 1984 baboon to human heart transplant by a creationist Loma Linda University surgeon. Prothero's dire warning is a message I have read before, especially from Niles Eldredge, but here, Prothero's remarks are most compelling, and ones that ought to be heeded by all (Not surprisingly, Prothero compares and contrasts current denial of evolution with that of global warming, and finds obvious parallels with both.).

5,0231139624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5686119-book,5,"Evolution: What the Fossils Say and Why it Matters by Donald R. Prothero“Evolution: What the Fossils Say and Why it Matters"" is an outstanding book that focuses on the fossil record as strong evidence for evolution. It covers the science of evolution with great expertise and eloquence. The book is basically broken out into two main parts. The first part focuses on the science or progression of evolution while the second part gets into the more technical and fossil case studies. Dr. Prothero’s scientific background is unquestioned and is an accomplished science writer evidenced by the number of books and papers under his belt. He tackles many fascinating topics of evolution with proficiency and annihilates the so-called evolution-creationism “controversy”. This is a reference quality book on evolution and is a significant scientific contribution. This 408-page book is broken out into two main parts: Part I. Evolution and the Fossil Record, and Part II. Evolution? The Fossils Say YES.Positives:1.	Reference quality book.2.	Extensively researched by an expert in the field.3.	Great accessible science writing.4.	The always fascinating topic of evolution.5.	Great use of converging sciences to solidify points.6.	Excellent use of charts and diagrams. 7.	Great defense of science. Explains what science is all about.8.	Evolution is a scientific fact. “But even if Darwin’s mechanism, the theory of natural selection, were to be rejected by scientists, it would not change the fact that life has evolved”.9.	One of the main goals of this book is to debunk creationism and it succeeds by providing overwhelming evidence. One of the great strengths of this book. Bravo!10.	A who’s who of creationists and their weak positions exposed.11.	Creation myth debunked! 12.	A historical look at creationism and evolution. Great stuff.13.	The author does a wonderful job of explaining what the threats to science are.14.	 A fascinating look at geology, “The geologists who first discovered the fact that fossils change through time, or faunal succession, were actually devoutly religious men who were not trying to prove evolution (an idea that would not be published for 50 or 70 years after they discovered faunal succession)”.15.	A close examination of the “great flood”. Interesting.16.	Understanding punctuated equilibrium, mosaic evolution…17.	The genius of Charles Darwin and his legacy.18.	Some fascinating and eye-opening facts…I will not spoil them for you.19.	The importance of regulatory genes.20.	Thought-provoking quotes, “Yet amidst all this turmoil no biologist has been lead to doubt the fact that evolution occurred; we are debating how it happened”. 21.	How converging science like genetics solidify evolution.22.	The impact of Hox genes.23.	Systematics one of the least understood by the general public. Cladistics…24.	Human evolution, awe-inspiring. The fossils, the evidence…25.	Debunking the distortions of the fossil record that the creationists promote.26.	Living up to the title, what the fossils say.27.	Microfossils and why they are ideal for evolutionary studies.28.	One of the great strengths of this marvelous book: a look at a number of captivating cases of transitional forms. I can’t stress that enough. Awesome!29.	Many great evolutionary breakthroughs covered in this book. With plenty of examples.30.	Great fossil discoveries.31.	The author does a wonderful job of helping the reader ground the timelines involved with evolution. The combination of lucid narratives and illustrations is an effective teaching tool.32.	What teeth tell us about our ancestors.33.	How close are human and chimpanzee DNA. Find out.34.	The author closes out the book with a persuasive plea in defense of science. 35.	Links worked great!36.	An extensive and I mean extensive bibliography.Negatives:1.	Creationists don’t need to believe evolution but if they care about their beliefs corresponding to reality must certainly learn to accept it. This book will rattle dogmatic believers.2.	I will disagree with the author that supernatural hypotheses cannot be tested in a scientific manner. Some can be…take the efficacy of prayers as an example. Can prayers help amputees grow a new limb?? I do however, respect the author’s stance.3.	Science is moving at a fast pace so some new findings in particular in the genetics field has altered some things from this book. For instance, there are some new findings that show that Neanderthals in fact did mate with humans. The book was published in late 2007, so some minor differences are bound to happen. In summary, I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I’ve read a number of books on evolution as my further suggestions will attest, and this book has become one of my favorites. It’s great science writing with conviction and passion. Dr. Prothero cares about the state of science and in particular the so-called scientific controversy and relentlessly goes after creationists who attempt to undermine science and in particular evolution. The book is thorough, comprehensive and quite enlightening. It is reference quality and I really appreciate how the author lets the reader know the areas in which creationists misrepresent or flat out lie about scientific facts. One of the greatest strengths of this book is the number of cases in which the author provides fossil evidence for transitional forms. The author also uses converging scientific knowledge such as genetics to solidify his arguments. An absolute intellectual treat!

6,0231139624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3514295-adam-smith,5,"Fascinating read. Very enlightening on the subject. I mainly bought this book because I thought it would cover some of the more unique factors and discoveries within evolutional history. While it does contain some interesting facts about evolution (like how whales and snakes still have hips), an portion of the book is spent discussing the ignorance and deceitful tactics of fanatical creationists; which is understandable given the fact that prothero has dedicated his life to the subject and has to face a constant barrage of mindless attacks from people who refuse to do proper research. It is unfortunate that a text on evolution would need to first deal with the problem of creationist thinking, but after reading about some of the things that have been done in the name of willful ignorance I can understand why the religious fanatics garner such hate and ridicule from anyone with a modicum of knowledge on the subject; luckily the problem does not appear to be as bad outside the confines of the United States. An excellent text covering a broad overview of the evolution of life on this planet; from single cell to hominid. Well worth reading for those with an interest in the subject. Prothero does an excellent job explaining the scientific workings of evolution, even though some places still come across as a bit dense. "

8,0231139624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/653510-sarah,4,"I think a more appropriate subtitle of this book would have been ""Creationists Can't Be Bothered."" Having been one and having spent some of that time trying to sort out why everybody thought the way they did, I understand why he kept coming back to that phrase. When you don't understand science and when it doesn't interest you, reading about it piecemeal on the Internet is exhausting. The conclusion I came to out of that exhaustion was just to think, ""Gee, there's nothing one side can argue that the other side can't answer"" and to therefore stop thinking about it altogether. If you had asked me point blank if I was a Creationist, I would have said so, but at the same time I don't think I would have denied the fact that we can see evolution happening around us and that the conclusions scientists come to do seem to lead to effective advancements toward human goals in medicine, geology, and physics.They call this ""cognitive dissonance"" and I had it in spades. This book, especially the early parts that lay the foundation as to how scientists come to understand the fossils, was really speaking to my young adult self. So many of the experiences he has had as an educator were the same ones I had as the person being educated. I disrupted my college biology class while my high school acquaintances sank in their seats. I told an adjunct professor about the second law of thermodynamics fully expecting him to be stumped and being amazed when he absolutely wasn't.What's more, even though the church I grew up in didn't really harp on the subject very much, I have a very distinct memory of the very ""quote-mining"" Prothero is exasperated by. I work in a world class research library, you see. There isn't an article you could cite in any church that I can't get. And I did. And it said the opposite of what the Bible School Teacher said it did.I cannot remember if I pointed this out to that teacher. I have tried at least once to correct this kind of error, but I got dismissed and felt demoralized by it and may have not wanted to go through it again if it was not this time. I really doubt it would have changed his mind.The whole thing makes me sad. That man is still around the church, but I'm not. And I don't think there's anybody left with the inclination and the resources to check up on him.buuuuuuuuuuuuhMaybe I should stick to talking about the book. Okay.Lots of pictures. The first part is the best part, the part about fossils sort of bogs you down like the book of Numbers with its lists of incomprehensible names peppered with the occasional bizarre story (reptiles, except for crocodilians, can't breathe and eat at the same time; there used to be this crazy hornless rhino that was bigger than an elephant; fish be walking all the time, bro). He gets docked a star because his tone gets a little (albeit understandably) exasperated quite often. Though, he does a good job making clear that he isn't against religious people in general, just creationists in specific. Religion is great, in his book, so long as you keep it out of the science books.I got a lot out of it, but I think it's another book that won't be read by the people who need it most. The story of my life.Thanks Donald Prothero! Despite the depressed tone of this review, I really enjoyed the book! Also, now I know you're not Stephen Prothero who is a different human being altogether, apparently.The end."
9,0231139624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7701175-alison,5,"Despite Prothero's somewhat agitated style (the list of things that annoy varies from the incorrect use of the word fish to creationist distortions of science) this is possibly my favourite of the evolution primers around at the moment. Prothero discusses comprehensively the various mechanisms currently thought to contribute to evolution, and the varied areas of scholarship, from molecular biology to paleontology, which contribute to the field. He has a much more expansive view of evolution than Dawkins, whose books lead the field, and as such is able to efficiently explain how rapid evolutionary jumps are likely to occur, and how our genes facilitate rapid changes in form, downplaying the gradualism that Darwin, and now Dawkins, emphasise. In fact, his history of evolutionary science is fascinating, deliniating roles for many scientists of the time, and making it clearer that it was less the radical idea of one man, and more the culnimating point of contemporary understanding.The first part of the book covers off these topics, in between launching tirades against the creationists, and taking a detailed approach to debunking their main claims. As someone who does not live in a nation where creationism is a common worldview, it can seem a little ridiculous to dedicate the best part of a chapter to explaining why the genesis story of Naoh's Ark could not have created the fossil record, but unfortunately the constant undermining of science teaching in the US by such beliefs necessitates such intellectual exercises.The second part of the book is narrow in focus, deliniating the fossil record from the origins of life to the development of homo sapiens. It is excellently done, if a little dry in places. Prothero doesn't pretend this is the sum of evolutionary science - it is a paleontology book concerned with the fossil record, without detailed accounts of molecular and DNA studies, but he refers to them where they influence the findings of paleontologists. It is through, and for those like me who like to understand the big picture, simply invaluable reading. It is easily the text I would recommend to anyone with the basics of natural selection looking for a better understanding of how evolution has shaped our world. It does focus on the animal life development, plants seem conspicuously missing from the later chapters. In this, as in other things, you can see the influence of the creationists, and Prothero's detirmination to counter their arguments, and hence concentrate on areas most commonly raised by them.The book is particularly valuable for being relatively recent, and able to incorporate recent discoveries - the sense of how much more we understand every year provides a mild thrill for those so inclined. :)I couldn't help wishing some of the tirades against creationism had been cut in order to allow for a fuller explanation of some areas of development - the evolution of reproduction, for example. And Prothero's focus on how the record shows the evolution of forms very occasionally seems to overwhelm an understanding of why such forms might have developed (frilly necked dinosaurs, for example). Thankfully, Prothero's excellent referencing system, and helpful list of further reading from each chapter should keep me going for a while. "
10,0231139624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/887347-uos-s,5,"My second book on evolution (the first was Dawkins The Greatest Show on Earth). This one is probably a bit more palatable to those with a creationist background, since Prothero is at least a theistic evolutionist. He mentions in the acknowledgement section ""I am grateful to my brilliant pastor, the late Rev. Dr. Bruce Thielmann, who showed me that you could be religious and intellectual at the same time."" Anyway, there is a wealth of info on fossils for all the major branches of the tree of life. Actually, I was a bit overwhelmed by the sheer number of transitional fossils presented, especially with all of the names in Latin. So, after reading this book I don't think I could believe a statement such as ""There are no transitional fossils."" However, fossils are only brought into focus in the second half of the book. The first half gives a very good overview of philosophy of science, the history of evolution, the history of creationism and flood geology, the history of the conflict of the two, and some comparative mythology thrown in just for good measure. All of these topics are highly relevant to the controversy, in addition to the fossil evidence.After reading this book, I did some Googling about ""Enuma Elish"", and found the writings of another theistic evolutionist, a minister, that explained Genesis from a totally different perspective than I was raised with, and that was one influence that led me to leave Biblical literalism in the dust (The other was: Misquoting Jesus: The Story Behind Who Changed the Bible and Why). I also found out that a coworker of mine had grown up the daughter of a minister, and he had even taught a class on this very topic! Certainly not the sort of churches I grew up attending.. reminds me of something Dan Barker said about there not being just one Christianity, but a spectrum."
11,0231139624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4142965-rob-smith,3,"In the past ten to fifteen years there's been a renaissance in science writing. This is partly fueled by the controversy of intelligent design to be inserted into textbooks and curriculum in public schools. This lovely little book by Donald Prothero joins the constellation of evolution defenses that has formed in recent years, and is actually one of it's brightest stars. Whether the information inside is familiar or fresh, this is a book that nearly everyone can read.The main thrust of the book is fossils. For anyone who's watched a creationist debate, the fossil record is among the most abused and misunderstood pieces of evidence in science today. Prothero's book is divided into two parts. The first part examines the basic tenants of evolution and how it was received by the world around it. The second part is a stellar demolishing of creationist tracts, via the method of going over the fossil evidence in great detail. Prothero's second part covers everything from biogenesis, to fish, to mammals. It is, by far, one of the most exhaustive catalogues of fossil data and why it upholds evolution I have ever read.Prothero also holds special contempt for creationists. He will quote an attack against evolution and than promptly demolish it. Duane Gish, whom Prothero debated some years ago, is quoted quite a bit. At times this book can outclass the infamous DawkinsThe book is not just a screed against creationism, but a love letter to evolution and it's intellectual history. Prothero writes and cites every biologist from Darwin, to Mayr, to the late great Stephen Jay Gould. He clearly knows his stuff. Included within are also a high number of pictures and diagrams of various fossils and evolutionary processes, much more than the typical pop-evolution book!Overall, this is one of the finest science books I have read, and is an especially fine defense of evolution. I would recommend this one over anything Richard Dawkins wrote."
12,0231139624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14453112-anne,5,"This is an outstanding book. Donald Prothero has put together an extremely comprehensive account of the fossil record as it stands today. There are chapters on the origin of life; prokaryote development; microfossils; the evolution of the backbone and the first vertebrates; the transition from fish to tetrapods; from primitive tetrapods to amniotes; the evolution of dinosaurs and from avian dinosaurs to birds; from primitive synapsids to mammals; and the evolution of humans.Each chapter lists the many transitional fossils in each group – over the last couple of decades, the fossil record has increased substantially to provide excellent transitional forms for many groups and species – as well as corroborating evidence from molecular biology. Some species have such a complete transitional fossil record – the whale for example – that they merit sections of the book all to themselves.But there is much more than that in this book. The first part of the book deals with the nature of science and the importance of the scientific method. He explains how fossilisation occurs, and how rocks are dated. He outlines the evolution of evolutionary biology itself, from before Darwin up to the latest uses of the cladistic model of evolutionary heritage and DNA analysis.Prothero also gives an account of the history of the creationist movement in America, giving a damning appraisal of the pseudo-science of “flood geology” and “intelligent design”, and clearly demonstrating exactly where and why creationists distort, lie about, or just ignore, evidence for evolution. He pulls no punches in his portrayal of them, nor in his obvious disgust for their intentions to disrupt science education. I cannot recommend this book highly enough – it is extremely well written, and full of fascinating and meticulously researched facts. It should be required reading for all."
13,0231139624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3391424-rachael,4,"This isn't a book for the feint of heart. The first half is thorough and convincing, the second half is a bit overwhelming. The second half of Evolution is devoted to going over fossil evidence, and it's very detailed and technical. Overall I thought this was a fine book, and a good one if you need a reference book. My only complaint is Prothero's intense interest with creationism, it can get a bit distracting, though in the light of the immensely overwhelming evidence in favor of evolution I suppose I can understand how it would be frustrating to have to deal with those people."
14,0231139624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1010629-barry,0,"So there's the tetrapod clade, then the amniote clade, which includes mammals, THEN comes the reptilia. So we're not descended from reptiles. I'm having an identity crisis."
15,0231139624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16090684-david,4,"It's a good and comprehensive (for a non-technical work) book about evolution with a focus on the fossil evidence for transitional forms for modern families and species. I didn't think it needed all the space devoted to refuting creationism – the evidence is abundant and clear, and I don't think anyone who would take the time to read this book is on the fence about it. I also would have liked to learn more about how and why so many species are extinct now (for instance there used to be many more equine species, but very few currently extant); perhaps this is not known or is too speculative, but the book does lean towards lots of facts – this bone is this way in one species, but in a related species it's that way – told in a catalog kind of style which I find a little dull at times. However overall an excellent book by an author who is obviously an expert and invested in explaining how science works, and how the fossil evidence for evolution is overwhelming."
16,0231139624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5891627-jo-green,4,"This book presents facts against creationist arguments. The author presents early on that religion and science are not incompatible for many Christians or scientists, he just explains the arguments that creationists use and has rebuttals. He also gives information on how science has been leaving the classroom due to a direct attack by a relatively small group of people and how that group of evolution deniers has grown as a result. It is full of fossil history, where fossils are stored, and how a museum of actual fossils is in danger in Africa due to fundamentalist beliefs there. Basically, don't destroy evidence and availability of real science if it threatens your belief. If you don't like the museum and its contents, don't go. It is never that simple though if a creationists belief is challenged. Good book, I didn't need convincing, but the information is good."
17,0231139624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/662191-noreen,4,"This book covers a lot of ground, only hinting at the incredible detail involved in the study of the fossils. It is accessible and interesting to the casual reader, and for anyone wishing to focus more deeply on a particular aspect, there is a bibliography at the end of each chapter.The fact is not that there are no transitional forms, it is that EVERYTHING is a transitional form: life is a tree, a continuum, and the concept of categorizing everything is a holdover from the biblical concept of special creation. DNA research has shown that every living thing is related to every other living thing. The old method of taxonomy is outdated; it's from the ""kinds"" of animals that God told Noah to save.Something I think Prothero could have made clearer in Chapter 3 is the explanation of the controversy over the term ""punctuated equilibrium."" That term was coined by Stephen Jay Gould, who apparently vacillated on his own definition of it. This waffling, unfortunately, has given the creationists much fodder. From my reading of Richard Dawkins, here's how I see it. Just because the fossil record is ""punctuated"" doesn't mean the process of evolution went in great leaps and bounds. Though the speed of change varies, evolution is always gradual, at least compared to our concept of time. If a certain ""speciation"" took only hundreds or thousands of years (abrupt when considered in deep geologic time), then ""transitional"" forms may not have fossilized. As Prothero explained, we are lucky we have a tiny part of one percent of the history of life to examine, because fossilization is so very rare. I put ""speciation"" and ""transitional"" in quotes, because those words are human constructs, born of our need to categorize everything and based on biblical concepts. However, as Dawkins has explained in writing regarding the controversy over punk eek, everything is a transitional form. ""Species"" is just a word we use to categorize currently living organisms. Today's taxonomy doesn't apply to ancient organisms. Evolution is a continuum; there is no bright line between species. In fact, DNA research has made it clear that life is a tree and everything is related to one degree or another. What exists now is simply the tips of the branches of the tree, which continues to grow and branch. People try to categorize ancient organisms into species by comparing them to currently living organisms, and it doesn't work that way. Today's categories will be meaningless a million years from now. I think Prothero's use of the words ""speciation"" and ""transitional"" without explaining them that way furthers the confusion. [Note; He did clear up my confusion in the chapter on systematics.]I found the chapter on systematics (taxonomy), or cladistics, interesting and enlightening. Before the current molecular techniques and newer ideas about embryology and anatomy, classification of fossils involved a great deal of guesswork (and controversy). Cladistics is more scientific, more exact. Strict cladists don't make claims that aren't testable. They don't talk about ancestry or descent, only relationships. They look at shared derived characters to compare organisms. There is still controversy, mostly because of the paucity of the fossil record, but this system of categorization is now widely accepted.Interesting fact: Homo habilis is now known as Homo rudolfensis and Homo erectus is now Homo ergaster. Are the new names cladistic?In conclusion, I found this book extremely educational. It cleared up many misconceptions I had about fossils. For instance, there is the central idea that Prothero continually reiterates: evolution is a bush, not a ladder. Organisms are no longer claimed as being ancestors or descendants of one another. They are related to each other, with nodes connecting them, but the vast majority of organisms may be branches that went extinct (like the hominids that are related to us but did not survive). As Richard Dawkins wrote in The Blind Watchmaker, ""But however many ways there may be of being alive, it is certain that there are vastly more ways of being dead, or rather not alive."" The common diagram that is still used to illustrate human evolution, showing the line of ape to human, is misleading. To put it another way, we didn't ""come from"" an ape; we share a common ancestor with the apes. Another idea I had was that those complete, articulated skeletons we see in museums are representative of what is found in the field. Actually, fossilization is a rare occurrence and we are lucky to have what we do. Many animals are identified by a single tooth or a microscopic shard of bone or shell. The complete record demanded by the creationists is completely unrealistic, yet they use the ""gaps in the fossil record"" argument to support their claim of a supernatural creator. That is an extraordinary claim requiring extraordinary evidence, for which they have provided no evidence at all, even when their ""experts"" are given an opportunity to do so in a court of law. (See Kitzmiller v. Dover, 400 F. Supp. 2d 707, M.D. Pa. 2005)I don't remember learning about evolution -- or really much science at all -- in school (it was public school in the sixties in the conservative rural Midwest). This book, along with those by Dawkins, Shermer, et al., have filled the gaps. It's a shame that so much of it is devoted to arguments against the creationists, but that battle is essential because the combination of a poor educational system and the religious right's PR machine have resulted in the U.S. being the wealthiest and yet most ignorant nation on earth, a nation that is rapidly losing its place as a world leader. Science denialism is not harmless -- it is causing real damage to our future."
18,0231139624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/100913490-matt-benic,4,"I'm in two minds on this book. On the one hand, it is an excellent - and needed - treatment of the absurdities and dangers of creationism, with a good discussion of the science that refutes it. On the other, that's not really what the title of the book suggests. The title is both misleading on its focus and a disservice to just how broadly the topic of evolutionism vs creationism is covered. I clearly made a mistake by judging the book by its title (and cover) and as a result, I was really looking forward to something more focused on the fossils and fossil sequences. This will definitely go into my collection of titles to suggest when someone says something silly like ""it's just a theory"", but my appetite for an in-depth investigation of important key fossils goes unsatisfied."
19,0231139624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50413625-mark-wrench,3,"This book only gets three stars from me, because, like Dawkins, Prothero spends too much time trying to disprove creationists. Essentially, this book's main focus is 'why creationists are wrong.' I was expecting a book about evolution and fossils, rather than a rant about creationism, logic and information on the scientific method.I'm an English atheist who rarely has any problems with creationists so I don't give a rat's backside about creationists obviously incorrect arguments.Dear biologists, please write more books about biology for the general reader; it's far more interesting than reading about an argument that you've already won. "
20,0231139624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10449329-peter,3,"Book was a little different than I expected. He has a focus through out the book of discrediting Creationist claims about the evidence of evolution. The first part describes evolutionary history and basic evidences. The second part gets into what I thought was the main focus: fossils. Here he clearly shows his stuff going through many fossil families and explaining them. It is filled with much latin, phrases (names) etc, that I found uninteresting but that is the how they are classified.Overall the book answered my need to understand the fossil evidence."
21,0231139624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24409180-guy-lenk,5,This was a well written book on evolution. A good deal of it was a scathing rebuke of the pretend science of creationism/ID. Protehero is an author who has 'done the work' of fossil analysis and he also clearly has a knack for commincating with the public. This is a must read for those who want a better understanding of evolution and a better understanding of the war on facts that religious zealots are undertaking.

23,0231139624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/111375229-darren-lillian,2,"Not what I expectedThis book provided lots of examples of evolution in action, which was a positive for me. I didn’t like the fact that it spent an inordinate amounting time discussing the conflicts with ID as well as the history of evolutionary thought."
24,0231139624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/115967408-sirmaxford,5,"A great read about evolution. To say the least, it is mind-boggling to take a look at these scientific findings and the conflicts around these findings. I recommend this book to every human being. "
25,0231139624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5818678-dave,5,"I'd unreservedly recommend this book to anyone curious about the evidence for evolution. It appears to be targeted at the scientifically interested but non palaeontologically educated reader.The production values of the book are superb and, like its text, it oozes business-like quality. It is hardback, printed on a beautiful heavy paper stock. The author's style is very clear and remarkably concise, considering his academic background. (My past experience is that many learned gentlemen - and it seems to be more of a male trait - never use two words when a couple of hundred would suffice!)The first section of the book is an overview of science, the scientific mindset, the theory of evolution and its history, as well as the history of creationist evangelism and its impact on science education in the US. Though apparently a Christian himself, Prothero pulls no punches in dismantling the creationist objections to the fossil record. The second, and larger, section of the book examines the fossil evidence for each stage of the evolution of life on earth. Such an endeavour could quickly become bogged down in too much detail for the non-specialist reader; on the other hand, too little detail would undermine the book's whole objective. The author, in my uneducated opinion, strikes the perfect balance by providing ample explanations in sufficient detail for the main fossils at each stage and then provides a recommended reading list at the end of each chapter for those who want further detail. At the relevant places the author also dissects the creationist arguments and why they are wrong. His candour is refreshing when he points out where fossil evidence is sparse or even sometimes contradictory. However, unlike religious teachers, where, say Biblical, contradictions necessitate much 'spinning' and obfuscation, scientists relish them because it's an indication they may not have the full picture and they need to do further work to improve their understanding.My only criticism of the book concerns the illustrations which I believe let down an otherwise superb book. While it is liberally sprinkled with charts, diagrams, line drawings and photographs, it appears the majority were not created specifically for the book but have been borrowed from other publications. This causes two problems. First, the author is limited to those illustrations he can beg or borrow (and, as one would expect, each is meticulously attributed in the caption) and there has possibly been the temptation to include an illustration because it is available to be used, rather than because of its own merit and relevance to the text. A number of times I noticed that while the author was describing a particular species or lineage, the accompanying illustration was of a different species. No doubt they were closely related, but if so that relationship was unexplained. Second, and possibly more important, because the illustrations used are an ad hoc collection from a diverse variety of publications, there is no sense of continuity and uniformity of style in the visual presentation of the author's arguments. While seemingly trivial, this has a massive impact on the level of understanding imparted. There was inconsistency in the detail of labelling in some charts and illustrations, many of which seem to have been originally prepared for an academic audience and for whom further explanation was unnecessary.Overall, despite the problems with illustrations, I still happily gave this book five stars because of the clarity of thought and quality of the writing. But with proper illustrations a superb book could easily have been a classic."
26,0231139624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43656208-liam,2,"After reading this I'm not completely sure who the audience is supposed to be. Whether this is written for the creationist or someone trying to argue with a creationist it completely fails on both accounts. The reasons for being a creationist are based on culture, comfort and a perceived way of life. It's not about rationality and impartially examining evidence. You can't defeat and argument about identity with facts. 75% of this book is a waste of ink as it would convince nobody to believe anything that they already didn't. The tone Prothero takes throughout the book is one of indignation and arrogance. This is not how you convince anyone that their faith or culture is wrong. Personally, I have no time for creationist arguments as I know they are based on nothing and I certainly don't want to read about them in a book about fossils. At the same time I seem to have a better grasp on what the core of their arguments are better than Prothero; someone who actually spends time debating them. I wonder how often he thinks a creationist leaves one of his debates thinking they will look into the wonders of the natural process of evolution. I also understand that ID is a disturbing movement in the USA, but really it has no chance at influencing the international scientific community. Evolution is a fascinating topic and one worthy of discussion and a that is a discussion that will continue without creationists. In my opinion that is the only way to handle the whole thing: keep the discussion at a high level. This sort of book is divisive and serves no purpose but to gloat at the ignorance of the creationist and at the same time displays an ignorance about what their beliefs actually are. No ID is not science, anyone who knows anything about science knows that without trivializing the subject the way Prothero chooses to do. "
27,0231139624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32553593-elliott-bignell,5,"This beautiful book deserves the epithet of magisterial, but it is only fair to clarify that it is a work of advocacy as well as documentation. Richly illustrated and referenced, it is a mine of information about the current state of the record of evolutionary transitions from a professional palaeontologist and experienced defendant in the continuing creationist propaganda war. Prothero serves up a deluge of evidence of transitions in many major lineages, evidence which has burgeoned in recent decades, and explains clearly to the lay reader just how the evidence demonstrates transitions. (With diagrams!) At the same time, Prothero is an experienced debater in the public campaign against science by creationists and this aspect shows as he refers persistently to the fact that the existence of the evidence in question is invariably denied by some ill-informed or dishonest advocate or other. In fact, he can cite instances where a creationist debater has denied the existence of a transition just after he has shown slides featuring photographs of it. If you are just interested in fossils this aspect of the book could conceivably become wearing. Wearying though it may be, the fact is that this campaign exists and professionals like Prothero unfortunately have to expend their energy on it. I implore the reader, therefore, to bear this aspect lightly if it is not their primary interest. The carpet of gold that this book lays before the reader makes it worth tolerating the occasional attempt to roll a creationist Cleopatra in it and sink them in the Nile. It is unfortunate that so much energy has to be devoted to defending a body of theory that is not in doubt in the first place, but sadly that is the way it is."
28,0231139624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5806248-paul-bruggink,5,"The book is obviously intended for the popular audience, since the only footnotes in the entire book are in Michael Shermer's Forward. Donald R. Prothero does, however, provide a rather extensive ""For Further Reading"" list after each chapter, plus an 11-page bibliography and a 9-page index.Prothero points out in his ""To the Reader"" at the beginning of the book that many Christian denominations and Christian scientists have come to terms with biological evolution. He then goes on to make no attempt to hide his negative opinions about Young Earth Creationists and Intelligent Design advocates who haven't. I had to get to Chapter 5 (p. 121) before the creationist/creation science/ID rant diminished somewhat, though it never stopped, particularly against the late Duane Gish, against whom he debated once. It heated up again in the final chapter.Prothero makes a convincing case for the existence of various ""missing links"" in Chapters 9 through 15, with detailed descriptions of evolving features. Prothero gives the best explanation of cladistics classification that I've seen (pp. 130-133)He inserts appropriate discussions of his own research frequently, in addition to numerous helpful drawings, diagrams and photos, including 12 color plates.I recommend this book for anyone who wants a detailed description of the many transitional fossils and/or a better understanding of where creationists like the late Duane Gish or ID supporters go wrong in their arguments."
29,0231139624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8623740-petru,4,"As a individual curious about fossils and their importance, i found the book to be more than i could chew for a light reading; however, i was not disappointed, the book delivers, chapter by chapter, in a short form, different species and their evolution through time; also, it explains even more: from the genetics and embryology point of view our relationship with the rest of the living world. I really liked that it does not compromise the difficult parts of paleontology for the sake of quick reading, but goes into details, not as much as a textbook (but i do not have one of those yet), but enough to show the evidence( and there are plenty of those!)Of course, there are some errors( the book was published in 2007, i don't know if we knew then Homo Sapiens and Homo Neanderthalensis did actually interbred( we do now)This book has made me want read even more on the topic, and go out and look at the fossils at the exhibitions, or if i'm lucky, maybe even find one or two. So yes, it's a bit dry, but science-related stuff usually are. CAUTION: I did read this as an e-book version on my smartphone, so i would advise against reading it this way, because there are a lot of pictures, diagrams, and illustrations that make the book stand out- sadly, i missed that part; perhaps, i will read it some other time on a tablet"
30,0231139624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/626957-kitty,4,"This book gives the person interested in fossils a look at what's been found in the last 20 or 30 years. It's fascinating stuff! I didn't want to put the book down at times. Prothero goes from detailing both the finding of the fossils and the fossils themselves, to how pissed he is at creationists who do no actual science at all, then spend their time taking pot shots at the work of real scientists, and quote-mining their works. I enjoyed Prothero's attacks on such people, Duane Gish most prominently. Prothero is really a scientist down to his bones. He is appalled at people who call themselves scientists but who are not, and appalled at people who use credentials that don't relate to the field they're talking about. While the parts of this book where Prothero castigates creationist pseudo-scientists are fun, the best parts are the descriptions of fossils and the animals they were, and the strange and wonderful environments these ancient animals inhabited on this ancient planet. A great read! Enjoy!"
31,0231139624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10130521-aaron,5,"This is one of four recent books I consider indispensible for convincing any skeptic that evolution by natural selection is a fact*. Dr. Prothero accomplished two important tasks in this book. First, he demolishes the most common creationist arguments using facts and their own words (which demonstrate their duplicity). Second, he destroys the argument that the fossil record is somehow bereft of evidence supporting evolution. The number of examples he provides to support evolutionary theory is astounding. The only possible negative one could give to the book is that the number of examples is so overwhelming that it becomes numbing to read them after a while.This book will definitely make a creationist unhappy, but it is an invaluable resource for anyone else interested in educating themselves about evolution and the fossil record.* The other three books are1) Why Evolution is True by Jerry Coyne (general overview)2) Endless Forms Most Beautiful by Sean B. Carroll (Evo Devo)3) Relics of Eden by Daniel Fairbanks (Genetics)"
32,0231139624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16050221-jon,4,"An excellent read for understanding the science of the geology, archaeology, and paleontology that tells us who we humans are and where we exist on the massive tree of life. It humbles me to think what we have accomplished with our modest background in DNA structure. We are, after all, just one of the great apes. And yet that humble beginning also reminds us that we are still quite new to the planet (compared to most other organisms) and that we might be just another accident that marks the long course of evolutionary history. We have the chance to pollute ourselves out of existence, or instead to make a positive difference for the enormity of all the life on the earth.This is a good source to document the restless energy that scientists are using to reconstruct our history from the constantly expanding fossil evidence. It is still quite current and correct, as of this date."
33,0231139624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2531665-charlene,4,"Extremely informative and fast paced read. I am generally very interested in reading about progressive perspectives in evolution (providing the most up to date evidence) and generally not very interested in reading about the creationist - evolution debate. We spend too much time allowing creationist myths to be an anchor that keeps us from furthering a real scientific discussion. Even though the backdrop is answering to creationists, I still enjoyed the great summary of evidence for evolution. I would like to have seen him spend more time on genetic switches and address epigenetic changes. But, this brief read was definitely worth it. The thing I enjoyed most was his focus on how gene-centered evolution is far too myopic. It's time to expand the discussion. For those interested in the creationist - evolution debate, this is must read. "
34,0231139624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/345222-caesar,4,"This book has some great images, figures, and information, but it's real value lies in the introductory material dealing with the evolution/creation controversy and WHY it exists. I have read far and wide on the topic, and this is one of the best treatments of the matter I have come across.I do take issue with a few of the figs, in particular 8.18 on p.195. It is highly misleading, as there have never been any dragonflies or dragonfly-like creatures that had more than at most 3 pairs of wings (even that is a stretch). I get the point the author is trying to make regarding homeobox genes, but that figure is way too much of a stretch and totally unnecessary. It would have been much better to illustrate the point using arthropod legs, mouthparts, genitalia, etc."
35,0231139624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/702622-joshua,5,"I very much enjoyed this book. Though I was familiar with a lot of the arguments, it was great to have an overview from an expert in the field. It's remarkable how many incredible specimens have been discovered even in the last 30 years, and how they have added clarity to the picture of the past. It's also amazing how well defined a lot of the ""transitions"" are in the record. (sea to land, reptile-like to mammal, dinosaur to bird, etc.) I appreciated the introduction to cladistics, as well.I'd highly recommend this book if you're really curious about what the fossils say. It does get quite technical and dense in some places, and I would have loved to have about 3 times the images, but it's still by far the best book of it's kind I've found."
36,0231139624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10822999-leigh-jackson,4,"Very good book. Prothero isn't a great writer, and the prose is awkward at times, but this book (especially the second half) is a relentless barrage of well-documented facts about the existence of the transitional forms and fossils creationist nut jobs like Duane Gish and Ken Ham like to pretend do not exist. If anyone open minded doubts that the fossil record is best explained by the theory of evolution then this book should convince them. Prothero doesn't target religious belief in general and seems to adhere to the idea that religion and science properly inhabit different spheres. Instead he focuses his critique primarily on those religious folks who would twist or ignore science in order to support a world view based on a literal reading of texts produced by Bronze Age nomads. "
37,0231139624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8198095-jeffrey-cavanaugh,4,"A nice primer on the current contributions paleontology is making to evolutionary theory. In short, the fossil record is much, much richer than is commonly acknowledged by those skeptical of evolution's role in shaping life on Earth, and the past several decades of research have unveiled many, many examples of transitional fossil that, combined with molecular data, field research of living animals, and lab experiments with micro-organisms, simply makes the alternative hypothesis - supernatural creation (rolled eyes) - preposterous. Basically, if you believe in creationism of any sort you are either a religious fanatic, stupid, both (as they commonly go together), or simply woefully ignorant. This book merely drives that point home. "
38,0231139624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37735018-david-boyle,4,"A good if not particularly thorough read on the fossils demonstrating how life changed over time. What I didn't like was the time spent refuting the nonsense coming out of the mouths of the creationists. They, like every fanatical religious sect, are immune to facts, and no amount of evidence or discussion will change what they have to say. The title and its intro provide no indication that Evolution is at least partially intended to show the fallacies behind what the anti-evolution people have to say. That time and effort would have been better spent following the evolution of lineages the author chose to bypass due to 'lack of space'. What I had hoped to find, musings about what drove the changes that took place, are here not covered at all. "
39,0231139624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16212834-hannah-givens,4,"Good for a thorough skim or a deep reading, because it's dense and informative but written in a conversational, clear style. My only criticisms are in the packaging -- multiple minor errors, especially some sentences that were changed but retain a word or two from the original phrasing. It's always clear what he means, but it's distracting and makes it look less polished than it is. Also, a lot more of the book is devoted to debunking/explaining away Creationist misconceptions. I have no problem with that and again the information is good, but I didn't realize it had that angle from the packaging, and I like to know what I'm getting into. Still, I was at a point where I understood a lot of the basics and wanted something deeper without being impenetrable, and this was the perfect choice."
40,0231139624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/124458-syd,4,"Scientific language and readability come together in this book. I was surprised by some things that he presented and can't wait to discuss them with my paleontology professor. However, while I understand that a war has to be waged against the creationists, I became bored with the constant ranting. I understand that most of the leaders of the creationist movement have not actually studied fossils or have actual scientific training, I don't need to be told eighteen times. Given that, the last chapter was a nice summary of why we have to be worried about this movement and how lacking our scientific education is in this country."
41,0231139624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1107377-david,4,"Very good & thorough answer to silly creationist and I.D. critiques of evolution. The first half of the book explains what science is and how it works, what the theory of evolution is and how it works. The second half of the book follows the fossil trail of evolution through the geological strata. I am constantly amazed at how incredible the true history of life on this planet is; and at how much more amazing these facts are than the hoped for fantasies of creationists. My wife made fun of me for reading a textbook, but I informed her that there were no questions at the end of each chapter so it isn't a textbook. Close, but not quite. However, it could have used a glossary. "
42,0231139624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5152368-joe-iacovino,4,"Outstanding treatment of the subject matter. Works great on the high-side of intermediate level as there are a great many Eras and fossils discussed in rather rapid succession, so a solid precursory knowledge of paleontology is helpful. I actually did not expect such a bruising account of the Creationist mythology that was offered in the first half of the book, and then made example of to a lessor degree as the book went on, but Prothero fully excoriates the phonies with absolute contempt, and yet, he does so while providing wonderful explanations on why they are so very wrong. Fun, easy read with excellent illustration. Nice Job, sir."
43,0231139624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5315491-jonathan,4,"Etremely informative and well written, the wealth of knowledge in this book is almost overwhelming and I honestly don't see how any could doubt the author's premise with the wealth of data present.That said, the information regarding the author(s) of Genesis is a bit out of date and is likely not how things went down. The book could be a bit overly caustic at times regarding Young-Earth Creationist proponents; believe me, I have a great deal of antipathy towards the snake-oil salesman of the ""Intelligent Design"" movement, but I feel like the vitriol in the book could get distracting occasionally.Still a fantastic, and highly recommended, read."
44,0231139624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21203860-jay,5,"Donald Prothero is an insightful and gifted writer, and his skills definitely came to good use in this book. If you are looking for an in depth primer on the mountain of evidence for evolution as well as the ongoing mechanations of the Young Earth Creationists and Intelligent Design proponents, it would be hard to find a better book than this one. Although a bit technical at times, Prothero ultimately does a good job of making the latest findings of the leading evolutionary scientists accessible to the scientifically literate layperson. This book is definitely a worthwhile read, and I highly recommend that you add it to your to read list."
45,0231139624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15843630-stephen-dawson,3,"Perhaps 30% of this book is devoted to the important task of explaining why creationists are both wrong and frequently ignorant and dishonest. But I'd rather have read the other 70% as a positive account of the glory of the detailed fossil record and what it proves about the extraordinarily intricate story of evolution, and would have preferred to ditch the negative stuff entirely. I can understand the author's motivation, particularly for an American audience, but the religiously oriented creationists are very unlikely to read this book, and if they do they won't be convinced, so I'm not quite sure of the point."
46,0231139624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1508173-david,4,"This is one of several recently published books that address some of the ""objections"" to modern evolution, in this case the claims by some that there are ""gaps"" in the fossil record, or otherwise that the fossil record really doesn't support the evolutionary hypotheses. Prothero addresses and dismantles these claims one by one, showing how they are either based on hopelessly out-of-date results, or are in some cases willful distortions of known data. For those who wonder whether ""creation science"" or ""intelligent design"" should be taught in public classrooms, this is an excellent resource."
47,0231139624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7027577-sebastian,5,Anyone who has to debate the fossil record with a creationist should read this book. It is authoritative and well-written and comprehensive and completely demolishes the anti-evolution position with an abundance of facts and well-reasoned argument. It is also a great way to get a handle on the profound contributions of vertebrate paleontology to our understanding of the evolution of life on planet earth. 
48,0231139624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7728286-adam,5,"A good primer for the evidence of evolution. He covers not only evolution but geology, Cladistics (how fossils are classified), and abiogenesis. He also refutes many arguments by young earth creationists and proponents of intelligent design. Since he does cover such a wide range of topics he can't go too far in debth into anyone of them but it does give you a good overview over the evidence for evolution. "
49,0231139624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14901973-kasey,3,"A very good discussion of the scientific evidence and reasoning behind evolution. Clearly the author is very knowledgeable in this field. Most especially of the current fossil record. However, rather than being an evenhanded scientific account, it spends as much if not more time questioning the motives of the anti-evolutionary folks as discussing the proof and reasoning for evolution. That is why I give it a lower rating than I would otherwise."
50,0231139624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10131481-jerry-eckles,3,"Meh, it's real good when it's dealing with the facts of the fossils and arguments for evolution. But Prothero spends way too much time refuting creationist arguments. If you want a great book on the fossil record, Written in Stone is the one you want. A much better book; from historical development of evolutionary theory to the fossils, forms and transitions and how they shape our modern study of biology. "
51,0231139624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/557983-lauren,5,"A great book, full of all the information you need to understand why, indeed, the fossils matter and why they say what scientists say they do. He spares no criticism for the phony b.s. that is ""intelligent design"" (a philosophy of ignorance, as Neil deGrasse Tyson has often said) and holds nothing back. Fantastic, and everyone should read it."
52,0231139624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1248051-kyle-batson,4,He spends the first half of the book explaining the basics of the scientific process and the fundamentals of evolution before diving into the fossils. It's great to see an explanation of the fossils by someone with first-hand knowledge. Prothero very thoroughly eviscerates the creationist arguments with pure evidence. The illustrations are especially illuminating.
53,0231139624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1233538-alistair-rae,5,This is a very entertaining but intellectually rigorous history of all that constitutes the fossil record AND it is current research and results.It is a very absorbing combination of firsthand observation and scientific discovery abd analysis.Where are the legs that Creationists and ID advocates stand on? After this they have none! 
54,0231139624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1113365-clay,0,"I am enjoying this book, but I am DRAGGING through it.As a geologist, most of this information is not new to me at all (sorry if that sounded arrogant). However, I do see it as possibly a good book to put on my shelf, if I am a professor at some point, to lone to students who are struggling to break free of their creationist upbringing."
55,0231139624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/722092-j,3,A great look at the fossil record. This guy knows his stuff. But he spends way too much time bashing creationists. I would have preferred a narrative without constant interruptions of nonsense creationist arguments. He should cull that information from the book and include it in an appendix. 
56,0231139624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5236032-lynda,4,"Excellent book! Covers everything one should know about Evolution and written in lay terms for we who do not possess degrees in biology. Great photographs of fossils! So much evidence. No one needs doubt the validity of the ""theory"" of Evolution."
57,0231139624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3314747-denise,5,"Several topics presented in an accessible and enjoyable manner. I recommend this book to anyone who is interested in evolution, needs a brush up, or would like to explore why the creationist arguments fall apart."
58,0231139624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5893808-jack,5,"The sheer awesomeness of this book is overwhelming. A great introduction to what science is, how it works, followed by a crash course in the history of life on Earth, and a great overview of the unifying theory of all the biological sciences: evolution. READ THIS BOOK."
59,0231139624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9184648-mike-de-la-flor,4,This book is an excellent survey of the fossil evidence that supports the theory of evolution. It is well illustrated and thought it is geared towards a lay audience it will take at least an interest in the topic to get through the book.
