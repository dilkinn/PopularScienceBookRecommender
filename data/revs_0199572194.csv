3,0199572194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5686119-book,4,"The Laws of Thermodynamics: A Very Short Introduction by Peter W. Atkins“The Laws of Thermodynamics"" is a very solid and practical book that covers the core concepts of thermodynamics. Accomplished author of many science books and Professor of Chemistry at the University of Oxford, does the wonderful A Very Short Introduction series justice by providing readers with an accessible account of the four laws of thermodynamics. This well-written 144 page-book is composed of the following five chapters: 1. The zeroth law: The concept of temperature, 2. The first law: The conservation of energy, 3. The second law: The increase in entropy, 4. Free energy: The availability of work and 5. The third law: The unattainability of zero.Positives:1.	A professionally written book. Good science writing.2.	The book is sound and concise.3.	Does a great job of summarizing the properties of energy and its transformation from one form to another.4.	Though intended for the masses this book does not short change the reader.5.	Goes over every one of the four laws of thermodynamics in adequate detail.6.	Effective use of charts and illustrations.7.	The difference between dynamics and thermodynamics.8.	Terms are well defined: temperature, gas, work, heat, enthalpy, entropy, etc...9.	Name dropping...the scientific greats.10.	Entropy and disorder.11.	The importance of Gibbs energy in chemistry and in the field of bioenergetics.12.	The process of sublimation.13.	Absolute zero...cool.14.	The Boltzmann distribution.15.	The process of adiabatic demagnetization.16.	A further reading section. Negatives:1.	This is not as basic as the introductory series implies. Make no bones about it, thermodynamics is complex and even at its most basic it can be difficult.2.	You must grasp the terms early on to progress effectively through the book. 3.	More quantitative than expected.4.	No links to further reading material. In summary, this is a very good science book. The “A Very Short Introduction” series is a really good one intended for those who want to gain a basic understanding of a given topic in a concise manner. Professor Atkins succeeds in providing the reader the core concepts of thermodynamics. Thermodynamics is a complex topic so even at its basic it will test the resolve of some to get through it. It's good concise science writing on a challenging topic. If you are looking to get a basic understanding of the laws of thermodynamics, this is a good book to start. I recommend it.Further suggestions: ""Galileo's Finger: The Ten Great Ideas of Science"" by the same author, ""Thermodynamics for Dummies"" by Mike Pauken, ""Science Matters"" by Robert M.

4,0199572194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63804580-arno-mosikyan,5,"Temperature is the parameter that tells us the most probable distribution of populations of molecules over the available states of a system at equilibrium.The first law of thermodynamics is generally thought to be the least demanding to grasp, for it is an extension of the law of conservation of energy, that energy can be neither created nor destroyed.The internal energy of an isolated system is constant. That is the first law of thermodynamics, or at least one statement of it, for the law comes in many equivalent forms.In thermodynamics heat is not an entity or even a form of energy: heat is a mode of transfer of energy. It is not a form of energy, or a fluid of some kind, or anything of any kind. Heat is the transfer of energy by virtue of a temperature difference. Heat is the name of a process, not the name of an entity.Work is the transfer of energy that makes use of the uniform motion of atoms in the surroundings.When I gave lectures on thermodynamics to an undergraduate chemistry audience I often began by saying that no other scientific law has contributed more to the liberation of the human spirit than the second law of thermodynamics.The second law has a reputation for being recondite, notoriously difficult, and a litmus test of scientific literacy. Indeed, the novelist and former chemist C. P. Snow is famous for having asserted in his The Two Cultures that not knowing the second law of thermodynamics is equivalent to never having read a work by Shakespeare.To fix our ideas in the concrete at an early stage it will be helpful throughout this account to bear in mind that whereas U is a measure of the quantity of energy that a system possesses, S is a measure of the quality of that energy: low entropy means high quality; high entropy means low quality.The entropy of the universe increases in the course of any spontaneous change.We have assumed without comment that there is only one state of lowest energy; one ground state, in which case W =1 at T =0 and the entropy at that temperature is zero.This empirical observation is the content of the phenomenological version of the third law of thermodynamics: no finite sequence of cyclic processes can succeed in cooling a body to absolute zero.The entropy of all perfectly crystalline substances is zero at T = 0.At first sight, the third law is important only to that very tiny section of humanity struggling to beat the low-temperature record (which, incidentally, currently stands at 0.000 000 000 1 K for solids and at about 0.000 000 000 5 K for gases—when molecules travel so slowly that it takes 30 s for them to travel an inch).The entropy has reached its maximum value, a value which according to Boltzmann’s formula is proportional to log 2."

He manages the balance between keeping things simple (or at least not too technical) while not over-simplifying to the point of inaccuracy. This book about the Laws of Thermodynamics is part of the Oxford University Press series A Very Short Introduction, and like the others I have read in the series lives up to that description; it gives you the basics and in a very accessible way."

This was dreadfully boring and essentially ruined my reading for a couple weeks. I kept thinking each law would illuminate some startling new concept about the world, but instead it just led to another description of a cold sink absorbing energy from an anabatic container, thus contributing to the increased entropy of the universe and me falling asleep for about three days and flinging this book in dusty corners, there to sit unread and hated. My conclusion? The four laws that drive the universe are really boring and fairly basic. Also, temperature doesn’t exist and everything we do leads to and is based upon disorder and chaos."

From the sudden expansion of a cloud of gas to the cooling of hot metal--everything is moved or restrained by four simple laws. Written by Peter Atkins, one of the world's leading authorities on thermodynamics, this powerful and compact introduction explains what these four laws are and how they work, using accessible language and virtually no mathematics. Guiding the reader a step at a time, Atkins begins with Zeroth (so named because the first two laws were well established before scientists realized that a third law, relating to temperature, should precede them--hence the jocular name zeroth), and proceeds through the First, Second, and Third Laws, offering a clear account of concepts such as the availability of work and the conservation of energy. Atkins ranges from the fascinating theory of entropy (revealing how its unstoppable rise constitutes the engine of the universe), through the concept of free energy, and to the brink, and then beyond the brink, of absolute zero."

Not by any means an exhaustive treatment of the subject but a good memory-jogger for someone whose last encounter with Gibbs' Free Energy was sometime around 1987. Each chapter gives firstly a treatment of a concept in classical, 'bulk' thermodynamics, and then explains the statistical link to the micro-world. Peter Atkins tackles the subject with an appealing, dryly humourous approach punctuated with occasional, and slightly controversial, philosophical asides. "

He starts this right at the beginning by surprising me with a ""zero'th law"" and ends the book surprising me again by talking about temperatures below absolute zero. Most importantly, he explains why conventional measures of temperature are an accident of history and that a better approach would be to use inverse temperature. A good book."

Maybe it should get 1 stars from conveying not just confusing but false information?"
16,0199572194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5963979-jim-razinha,5,"Stephen Pinker mentioned this book in his Enlightenment Now and I noted in October of last year to find it. Well, now is when I carved out some time. I’m a mechanical engineer who doesn’t get to play with this kind of stuff but I still like it and now and then give myself a refresher course...or at least a reminder if not a whole course. I so could have used the first part when I took Thermodynamics II back in 1990! First assignment...that took three weeks of rejecting everyone’s answers before the professor (I’ve forgotten his name) tossed in the towel and moved on ... was to define temperature. I came the closest (also forgotten is whatever I came up with) because I submitted something I’d found in the History of Science Library - he gave me full credit for being an engineering student who knew there was such a library. But we didn’t call it the Zeroth Law. Atkins does a wonderful job explaining all the concepts.he does get down into the weeds so for the too long won’t read folks, here’s the layman’s translation of the three laws of thermodynamics:- You can’t win (can’t get more out than you put in...conservation of energy)- You can’t break even (entropy/disorder increases and not all heat is available to convert to work; any transfer of heat has some loss unless you can get to absolute zero, except...)- You can’t quit the game (you can never cool to absolute zero)I don’t know where I first heard it but that’s credited in some form to C. P. Snow. A few selected soundbites:“Heat is the transfer of energy by virtue of a temperature difference. Heat is the name of a process, not the name of an entity.”“In former times, the extra energy of the vapour was termed the ‘latent heat’, because it was released when the vapour re-condensed to a liquid and was in some sense ‘latent’ in the vapour. The scalding effect of steam is an illustration. In modern thermodynamic terms, the supply of energy as heat is identified with the change in enthalpy of the liquid, and the term ‘latent heat’ has been replaced by enthalpy of vaporization.” I guess when I took my classes in 1990 and 2000, we were still in “former times” because that’s what we called it!I’d not come across this relation before and I like it: There is a celebrated theorem, Noether’s the- orem, proposed by the German mathematician Emmy Noether (1882–1935), which states that to every conservation law there corresponds a symmetry. Thus, conservation laws are based on various aspects of the shape of the universe we inhabit. In the particular case of the conservation of energy, the symmetry is that of the shape of time. Energy is conserved because time is uniform: time flows steadily, it does not bunch up and run faster then spread out and run slowly. Time is a uniformly structured coordinate. If time were to bunch up and spread out, energy would not be conserved.“The second law has a reputation for being recondite, notoriously difficult, and a litmus test of scientific literacy.“ Yeah... lots of discussions over entropy. With respect to getting to absolute zero, “The challenge, partly because it is there, is to cool matter to absolute zero itself.” And this is just interesting Another challenge, to which we shall return, is to explore whether it is possible— and even meaningful—to cool matter to temperatures below absolute zero of temperature; to break, as it were, the temperature barrier.I’d never thought about coming from the other side...sort of like the other side of the Big Bang singularity, I guess. Anyway, if you like the fundamentals of thermodynamics, this is a good book. I found a confrontational counter title “The Four Laws That Do Not Drive The Universe: Elements of Thermodynamics for the Curious and Intelligent.” by Arieh Ben-Naim. I am curious and given to understand intelligent and was interested to read a different perspective (and why Ben-Naim has it in for Atkins) but I can’t find a copy that doesn’t cost more than my curiosity is willing to pay. So, not today."
17,0199572194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33709741-nigel-bamber,4,"This book is a great introduction to some of the most fundamental truths about the universe, and why something happens instead of nothing. I studied Engineering many years ago, and wish I'd had this clear explanation of things like enthalpy and entropy, and their wider implications, at my side then. I'm not sure how well anyone without a physics background would get on with it, but for me it was excellent. I've only given it 4 stars, instead of 5, because I was reading the Kindle version and some of the diagrams wouldn't zoom up from their tiny size, which made some pages hard going. If there was a 4.99 stars option, it would have got it.The explanation of how an insight into the nature of phenomena such as life, thought and even time itself grew out of an effort to make steam engines more efficient is fascinating.I have seen it postulated elsewhere that the past, present and future all coexist in block spacetime. The only thing that prevents us from seeing into the future, instead of just being aware of the past, is that our thoughts are thermodynamic processes, and because of the 2nd law of thermodynamics, have temporal direction. In the future that I cannot see, I hope that we manage to learn a lot more about the directionality of all nature's processes and their relationship to the arrow of time.For people with a trepidation about scientific explanations, I would point you towards Tom Stoppard's incredible play, ""Arcadia"", which deals with the same topics through a humanities lens, and will hopefully impart some of the feeling of awe that is generated in those that can read the mathematics."
18,0199572194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/101817972-upstart-go,5,"This is a book for people seriously interested in thermodynamics. It covers a lot of material quickly. It is dense. But, if you get through chapter 4, it is rewarding. In chapter 4 he explains how we live off of entropy. Entropy is fundamental to our being. We need disorder to increase. I found this to be beautiful. It's also great conceptual introduction to the fundamental concepts of thermodynamics and consistently insightful. For example, entropy is illustrated by an analogy to the sound of a cough. In a quiet library the sound of the cough has more impact then it does on a busy street. Likewise, heat entering a low temperature system gives less entropy than that same amount of heat entering a high temperature system [S=Q/T]. Also, heat is a process. It isn't a form of energy. It is the transfer of energy as disordered motion; whereas work is the transfer of energy through uniform motion. So, the book clarifies a lot of subtle things that could be tricky stumbling blocks. There are few mathematical derivations. This precludes some depth of explanation. Enthalpy is presented and applied, but this book doesn't explain where the definition comes from (Khan Academy has some good videos that supplement this material nicely). But this is only an introduction and maybe such derivations would be a distraction from the essential concepts and needlessly lengthen what is intended to be a breezy quick read. After reading this, consider reading Van Ness' Understanding Thermodynamics and Fermi's Thermodynamics."
19,0199572194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8509871-liz,3,"Part of me feels unqualified to rate this book; the other part feels justified, as the intended audience seems to be the laypeople of the world. Some of the analogies were really effective. I had a few “aha” moments and it made me feel like less of human garbage to understand how a steam engine works on a basic level. (When I forget in a few weeks or months, to garbage I shall return.) That third law graph/concept was frighteningly bizarre (in a good way, like parallel universes are), though I can almost grasp how, in terms of beta (it was amusing how upset the author is that we don’t use beta instead of Celsius or Fahrenheit), it makes perfect sense. Some of the equations I couldn’t really get no matter how many times I went over them, and I’m still shaky on Helmholtz and Gibbs energies. My only true disappointment, though, is that there weren’t more “big picture” connections that go into, say, the entropy of deep space or the transfer of energy in weather systems. I suppose I should be grateful for the mechanics of refrigerators and especially the part about how ATP is used to build proteins. I should probably reread this sometime."

I have read about the topic of this book by other authors but this author has made the subject readable and interesting. My favorite law is the LAW of entropy which we can't escape from.

What are the basic implications of the conservation of energy and the spontaneous rise of entropy?Pretty much of what we experience can be described by thermodynamic laws, and ignoring them may derail us into bad conclusions about the nature of the world. Just as we can't expect engines to produce more energy that we feed in, and that order can come into being only at the expense of an increase in the overall disorder, we cannot dedicate our mental energies to devise models that cannot account for thermodynamic laws, such as those who interpret time as an entirely reversible process (read: all theoretical instances such as the law of karma, which propose that future processes influence what we experience now).We are shifting toward an increasingly naturalistic understanding of the world; why not pick up this delightful Very Short Introduction format by Oxford Press and dedicate a couple hours to understand how the universe unfolds?

The book covers the four laws of thermodynamics (Zeroth: the concept of temperature, First: the conservation of energy, Second: the increase in entropy, and Third: the unattainability of zero temperature). The concept of free energy, which is the ability of a system to do work, also has a chapter. The chapters flow logically with discussion later in the book building upon concepts introduced in earlier chapters. I’ve got a degree in Physics and found the book useful as a refresher. Some concepts that I didn't really understand when I did my course made perfect sense after reading this book. The author is good at explaining scientific principles in an accessible way.

Suffice to say, I am now very much interested! Peter Atkins has a flare of delivering a difficult concept using stories and scenarios. I could picture the steam engines and the inside working of a refrigerator as he explained the 1st and 2nd law of thermodynamics. In my mind, I could see the electrons bouncing back and forth as Atkins explained temperature, heat and work. High school physics text swam before my eyes as formulae were dissected and then sewn back (and this time they made sense).

The concept of free energy, which is the ability of a system to do work, also has a chapter. The chapters flow logically with discussion later in the book building upon concepts introduced in earlier chapters. I’ve got a degree in Physics and found the book useful as a refresher. Some concepts that I didn't really understand when I did my course made perfect sense after reading this book. The author is good at explaining scientific principles in an accessible way.

I could picture the steam engines and the inside working of a refrigerator as he explained the 1st and 2nd law of thermodynamics. In my mind, I could see the electrons bouncing back and forth as Atkins explained temperature, heat and work. High school physics text swam before my eyes as formulae were dissected and then sewn back (and this time they made sense).

What are the basic implications of the conservation of energy and the spontaneous rise of entropy?Pretty much of what we experience can be described by thermodynamic laws, and ignoring them may derail us into bad conclusions about the nature of the world. Just as we can't expect engines to produce more energy that we feed in, and that order can come into being only at the expense of an increase in the overall disorder, we cannot dedicate our mental energies to devise models that cannot account for thermodynamic laws, such as those who interpret time as an entirely reversible process (read: all theoretical instances such as the law of karma, which propose that future processes influence what we experience now).We are shifting toward an increasingly naturalistic understanding of the world; why not pick up this delightful Very Short Introduction format by Oxford Press and dedicate a couple hours to understand how the universe unfolds?

I must have read it about 4 years ago and on the reread I found I had not retained very much. This time around I took notes and did some of the math that the author left for the reader to figure out on his/her own. In this way I got a lot more out of it. To be sure, there's a lot of material packed in these few pages."
273,0199572194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46710074-alessandro-veneri,5,"What is temperature? How do you define heat? What are the basic implications of the conservation of energy and the spontaneous rise of entropy?Pretty much of what we experience can be described by thermodynamic laws, and ignoring them may derail us into bad conclusions about the nature of the world. Just as we can't expect engines to produce more energy that we feed in, and that order can come into being only at the expense of an increase in the overall disorder, we cannot dedicate our mental energies to devise models that cannot account for thermodynamic laws, such as those who interpret time as an entirely reversible process (read: all theoretical instances such as the law of karma, which propose that future processes influence what we experience now).We are shifting toward an increasingly naturalistic understanding of the world; why not pick up this delightful Very Short Introduction format by Oxford Press and dedicate a couple hours to understand how the universe unfolds? Peter Atkins is wonderfully clear and leaves almost no burden of comprehension onto the reader. Detailed and practical pictures complete this outstandingly curated handbook."
274,0199572194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4493263-joshua,4,"This is an interesting and thought provoking book about the laws of thermodynamics. The level of treatment is accessible to any intelligent person, being mostly a qualitative discussion with occasional mathematical formulas. Concepts are illustrated with diagrams and examples. The book covers the four laws of thermodynamics (Zeroth: the concept of temperature, First: the conservation of energy, Second: the increase in entropy, and Third: the unattainability of zero temperature). The concept of free energy, which is the ability of a system to do work, also has a chapter. The chapters flow logically with discussion later in the book building upon concepts introduced in earlier chapters. I’ve got a degree in Physics and found the book useful as a refresher. Some concepts that I didn't really understand when I did my course made perfect sense after reading this book. The author is good at explaining scientific principles in an accessible way. I found the book very useful and recommend it."
275,0199572194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26442981-sehar-moughal,5,"A great read. I stumbled upon this book by accident (I had no active interest in studying the field of thermodynamics). Suffice to say, I am now very much interested! Peter Atkins has a flare of delivering a difficult concept using stories and scenarios. I could picture the steam engines and the inside working of a refrigerator as he explained the 1st and 2nd law of thermodynamics. In my mind, I could see the electrons bouncing back and forth as Atkins explained temperature, heat and work. High school physics text swam before my eyes as formulae were dissected and then sewn back (and this time they made sense). Now, I have a greater understanding of thermodynamics and definitely will not hesitate to read more on the topic. The laws of thermodynamics apply to everyday life, yet not many are aware of its mechanics. This book is a great start to the topic! "

"
277,0199572194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5085729-feliks,3,"This is one steamy book. I fumed and panted, waiting for it to arrive. In truth, I was a bit worried that I might find it dry, but that wasn't the case. I started it in the library one night with the flue.Now, I wouldn't say it fans the flames of any controversy, but it did light a fire under me. Sparked thought. Set me off. Some chapters practically had me in a sweat. Nearly too hot for me to handle. All too soon, it died down. Yep--I fairly burned right through this slim little volume as soon as I got it between my hot little hands. Highly recommended, though. If you are afire for this subject matter, then this is the book for you. Nothing can match it. Asbestos breed. Only, you can (and should) avoid the Kindle version."
278,0199572194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3189888-bob,4,"Thermodynamics is a deep subject, and this book did a good job of showing the highlights of how it works. The author had a very interesting explanation of heat: ""In thermodynamics heat is not an entity or even a form of energy: heat is a mode of transfer of energy. It is not a form of energy, or a fluid of some kind, or anything of any kind. Heat is the transfer of energy by virtue of a temperature difference. Heat is the name of a process, not the name of an entity.""I had taken two semesters of thermo when I was in college, 40 years ago, did well with it but never really understood it very well. Now, I am interested in revisiting this subject, and I want to do the Khan Academy's series on this. At some point, I will read Peter Atkin's book again."
279,0199572194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52398489-maria-renate,4,"I'd give it a five star rating, except that I know that I didn't understand everything presented. However, if you want to have your mind stretched and re-learn something you had to memorize in high school (which is not learning), then I can recommend this book. The concepts presented allowed me to reconsider the Four Laws of Thermodynamics from unfamiliar angles and I profited from it. I am not a terribly sciency sort, but I know that even if I was, I would want to read this book. Atkins' language is as concise and simple, I suspect, as someone addressing such complex issues could hope to make it. If I, a BA in Literature, fantasy writer could read through this entire little volume and come away richer for it, then anyone can."
280,0199572194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19576353-yang,4," I had to read this book because I was doing a physics project on thermodynamics. This is a good starting point for people who didn't know anything about the subject before because (like all very short introductions) it's quite easy to understand. If there is anything you don't understand it'll become clear after reading the section again a few times. Nothing really difficult is presented, which I guess is good because it didn't scare me off the topic! However what you learn from the book is kind of a all-round knowledge, because it discusses all of the laws and some relevant concepts besides."

They are deeper and more interesting than I thought, just like reletivity laws, explaining such phenomenon as why absolute zero can't be attained and theorises what would happen if it was!"

The author goes through all four of the laws of thermodynamics concisely, including their histories and development. With that said a few minor gripes:1. I don't recall the arrow of time ever being mentioned - you'd think that would be worth getting across to a reader, concerning the Second Law.2. Given the book is aimed at the layman, there is probably a little too much mathematics in here.It's 100 pages and provides a near comprehensive introduction to thermodynamics - worth your time."

284,0199572194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/747142-ginny,3,"As a layman with no college math, this helped me understand a little bit about thermodynamics, though I think I'll need to reread a few more times for the concepts to sink in, but not sure you could ask more of a tiny 100 page treatment on the subject. I picked this up because I wanted to understand entropy better, especially as it relates to information theory. The author cops at the end to not daring to get into this domain, understandably sticking to the core concepts."
