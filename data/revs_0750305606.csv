Which might tell you how good it is, since I read the whole book in two sittings while in the painful computer lab! Best introduction to Cosmic-Super-Physics you can get. And it's great to get you started down the path of reading more and more complex books on this subject."

2,0750305606,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1852180-silvio-curtis,5,"The title's pretty accurate. The book covers the standard popular-physics-book basics of relativity, then goes into more detail about the ways that relativity allows time travel, especially involving wormholes. It developed from a lecture that the author gave to high-schoolers to recruit them to study physics. At one point he says that it ""was written with a teenage audience in mind,"" which could have put me off, but I'm glad it didn't. It is indeed a book that you could start without ever having heard of relativity, and it avoids math completely, but still manages to go into more detail than you might expect. It explains the difference between rotating (Kerr) black holes and non-rotating (Schwarzchild) ones, which I don't remember learning anywhere before. It was also interesting to read how Carl Sagan's request for help with Contact led to the discovery that macroscopic wormholes are theoretically possible."
3,0750305606,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18942380-william-schram,5,"Black Holes, Wormholes, and Time Machines by Jim Al-Khalili is a book popularizing some of the results of Einstein’s Relativity Equations. If you read about this sort of thing a lot as I do, this might not be anything new to you. This might especially be the case since the book was printed in 1999 so most of the work is current to 1998.The book itself describes the phenomena in question with skill and grace, remembering that this book is meant for laypeople and others unfamiliar with the subject. It describes the bending of spacetime being the cause of gravity, the experiments that proved Einstein to be correct and made him a household name and so on. The book talks about Olber’s Paradox, the Cosmic Background Radiation and other things related to the Big Bang and the expansion of the universe.As I mentioned, this book is meant for the common man or woman as the case may be. In that sense, the author avoids using too much scientific jargon and describes things in a manner that is easy to understand. With the “fabric” of reality and how it is warped by gravity, they use the rubber sheet analogy taking care to note that this is occurring in more dimensions than those occupied by a rubber sheet.It is somewhat amusing to me to read about people that don’t believe that the Speed of Light is as fast as anything can possibly go, but I suppose if you were never exposed to the equations I can’t really expect one to get it from everyday life. I mean, Special Relativity is only applicable when an object is going at an appreciable fraction of the Speed of Light. The fastest man-made vehicle is probably a rocket, but I doubt that many people will have the opportunity to even ride such a thing. Even in the case of a rocket, we are only talking about something barely capable of escaping Earth’s Gravity. Now 40,000 km/h or 25,000 mph might seem fast and it is. However, that is nothing to the Speed of Light. At an appreciable fraction of the speed of light time itself slows down. Due to the Mass-Energy Equivalence equation that Einstein is known for, you will begin to gain mass as you get closer to light-speed.In any case, this book was very good. It was a bit reminiscent of Paul Davies’ About Time which I think I still own somewhere. It covers a great deal of material in a thin package and has a bibliography if you are curious about any of the subjects and ideas covered."
4,0750305606,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1439381-maj,4,"This is my first non-all-out-space physics book. I love Prof Al-Khalili's TV programmes and have bought a few of his books in ebook form (well, apart from this one which is hugely expensive, instead got a PDF of it from Academia.edu). Definitely looking forward to reading the others but thought starting with the first one was as good a place as any.Not gonna pretend everything in this book lodged itself in my brain, (after all, at school I got Cs from physics and Cs and Ds in maths...and have since forgotten everything), but it pretty much gave me what I expected from it. And hopefully some of the basics are finally gonna stick from now on. (Like that there are two theories of relativity which I either never knew or have forgotten. See, that's my level of idiot right here.)It's obvious that even 20 years ago Prof. Al-Khalili already had a knack for relating science to idiots. And I actually enjoyed the ""attempts at humour"", thank you very much."

Alcuni capitoli risultano più impegnativi da comprendere ed è necessaria una maggiore attenzione, ma Al-Khalili riesce nel suo intento di rendere comprensibile una tematica tanto affascinante quanto complessa con il suo brillante umorismo da scienziato.Decisamente consigliato!"
6,0750305606,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28362632-alex-rond-n-reggio,5,"A crash course into astrophysics, particles physics, quantum mechanics and of course black holes, wormholes and time machines."
7,0750305606,http://goodreads.com/user/show/115082895,5,Aπο τα καλύτερα βιβλία για το συγκεκριμένο θέμα!
8,0750305606,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4830021-yash-arya,5,"The first book on cosmology I ever read. Teaches a lot, as simply as one could expect, while keeping the material fascinating enough that you can't keep the book down."
9,0750305606,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28093334-massis,5,Amazing!
10,0750305606,http://goodreads.com/user/show/86353173-joseph-sanchez,3,"Standard physics book. Educational. Neutral in explaining how time travel is possible with equal counterpoints on why it's impossible, which I liked.Could have cut down on the attempted humor, but otherwise a good book."
11,0750305606,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1090425-alisa-kester,5,"This was quite an amazing book, even though he actually doesn't believe in the possibility of time travel (he thinks the only way it would work was if the past, present, and future existed all together as one moment, and he believes that would negate free will. Which it doesn't, of course, so he and I disagree there). But overall, I enjoyed it and learned enough to make my brain buzz with all my newly acquired knowledge and ideas.I particularly loved this section, on quantum particles:""If we measure a certain property of an electron...then quantum mechanics will tell us what we are likely to find. However, it tells us nothing about what the electron is doing when it is not observed. This would not be a problem if we could trust electrons (and all other particles) to behave sensibly, but they don't. They will disappear from the place they were last seen and spontaneously reappear somewhere else that should, by rights, be inaccessible to them. They exist in two places at once, they tunnel through impenetrable barriers, travel in two different directions simultaneously, and even have several conflicting properties simultaneously. But the moment you look to see what is going on, the electron will suddenly start behaving itself again and nothing will look out of sorts. However, the unavoidable conclusions we have to draw from the results of our observations is that the electron was most definitely doing something very strange indeed when we weren't looking."""
12,0750305606,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28813481-yatharth-k,5," actual rating: 4.5 Stay true to its titleThis is amazing book for non-scientists new comers to this field.  Why you should read this book? if you love knowing stuff about universe, black holes etc. The writing is very easy going and concepts are made very easy to understand. If you have read any other book on these topics, I still recommend this book, because it further clarifies some concepts. It's a short book, that's why it doesn't get too dense for not-so-smart guys like me.  Why you shouldn't read this book?This book is very basic. If you have already read few books on the topic and know about Black Holes, Wormholes, this book won't add anything new.This book is written a while back. I hope the theories mentioned in this book are still acceptable among scientist."
13,0750305606,http://goodreads.com/user/show/175734-frostling,4,"Excellent book whose purpose is to familiarize the reader with the universe, how it was created, what it is made of, and how time affects everything.In order to explain how time travel could be possible (At least in theory), we are treated to a history of science, form the precursors of Newton, to the successors of Einstein.Despite the fact that this book is now 11 years old, it remains a good and compact introduction to physics, astronomy and cosmology.I particularly appreciated the description of how a 2D world would cope with 3 dimensions. All sorts of weird things would stat happening. It is an interesting analogy when we consider what happens in our 3D world when scientists focus on quantum mechanics."
14,0750305606,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3260303-jeff-brateman,5,"This is a great book for the layman enthusiast like myself. It got off to a very slow start. I thought I was in for a book written for 12 year-olds. However, as the book added on more and more to the base content, I was damn motivated to continue, just to see if I could wrap my head around each concept.My biggest fear with this book is that it is now dated by a few years, and new advances have proven or disproved some of the theorems discussed. That's ok though, as I do not need to write my own research paper on the subject of cosmology. :)"
15,0750305606,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13243018-peter,1,The content of this book was not too bad and along the lines of other books I have read on this topic. I like Jim as a writer and a presenter and am generally impressed by his work. My criticism of this book and its low rating are grounded on it being ludicrously overpriced for such a slim volume. I hope that Jim Al-Khalili had no influence over the price and that the blame can be put on a greedy publisher.
16,0750305606,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39785756-claire-stamper,4,"Intriguing read. Al-Khalili keeps his use scientific jargon on the down low and thoroughly explains unfamiliar terms and concepts, presents scientific evidence from a relatively objective viewpoint, and isn't dry and boring like so many other authors of the nonfiction science genre. I would recommend his book to anyone interested in understanding the possibility of black holes, wormholes, multiple dimensions, and time travel in our fascinating universe. "
17,0750305606,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8936495-katerina,0,"I´m very into this topic. But. I´m used to use my imagination. Fourth, fifth etc. dimension, parallel universes and space-curving is little bit above my othervise very colorful imagination (deformed by sci-fi series). What i can´t imagine, that i don´t get. I will definitely give a chance to this book again. "
18,0750305606,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4147570-eric,4,"Interesting, if somewhat condescending. The author seems to be a rather conservative physicist, which makes me wonder why he wrote the book at all. Nevertheless, it's loaded with facts about high-energy physics and easy-to-grok explanations. "
19,0750305606,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2366026-alexandra-anne,5,I am so grateful to this book for helping me visualize a fourth dimension. I've used the 2D world + 3D sphere analogy many times with remarkable success in helping people visualize it too. I recommend this book to anyone and everyone. 
20,0750305606,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17984897-lucy,4,Very informative and entertaining at the same time. I enjoyed reading it very much.

23,0750305606,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6032191-matt,5,"It's a good while since I read Jim Al-Khalili's Black Holes, Wormholes and Time Machines, but I will be forever grateful to him for teaching me how to visualise the fourth dimension. Really."
24,0750305606,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4336519-matthew,5,A brilliant read — full of not only fully scientific descriptions but funny quips from Jim throughout. 
25,0750305606,http://goodreads.com/user/show/238070-lafcadio,4,This one is good for stretching.
26,0750305606,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24143048-ben-hart,5,"Great book, bit slow to start due to laying down the ground work but worth it when things start to get weird."
27,0750305606,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4889938-carmen,5,"I adored it. A presentation of difficult cosmology concepts for lay people, spiced up with witty remarks. "
