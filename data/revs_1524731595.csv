0,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1237196-petra-x,3,"The blurb was better than the book. If this book had been entitled ""The story of my life, including a Year I Spent in Space"", I might have enjoyed the book more. Instead if was a feat of ... endurance. I had wanted to read about space not a biography.The author comes from a family where both parents are cops, there is domestic violence and the father and his cop friends think it's fun to have shooting matches sometimes using his son't craft projects as targets. Nice family. That is the most interesting bit about his biography. His marriages, girlfriend, twin brother (also an astronaut), his school, college, professional career and health issues just didn't really interest me. What I was interested in, a very prurient interest, but he didn't say, was when he had his prostate removed in a radical operation and he said the risks were incontinence and impotence. All the men I know who have had prostate removal as opposed to other treatments, all became impotent beyond the help of Viagra. The author had the operation rather than chemo and radiotherapy because it would enable him to get back into space quicker without any risk of a relapse. I wanted to know if he put space before his sex life. If so, I kind of wonder why his partner stuck with him, but then she was used to him going off into space, for up to a year at a time, so maybe she didn't care that much about that aspect of life. The space station, how it was a year there really did interest me but there was less information than inAn Astronaut's Guide to Life on Earth (a 10 star book, a great read and very informative),Too Far From Home: A Story of Life and Death in Space or Ask an Astronaut: My Guide to Life in Space, both 5 star reads.There is one really good quote, it is about a test that the author is taking and he can see the answers, however he doesn't know if he is supposed to be able to see them and should speak out (ie a test of honesty) or what. He says, ""I don't condone cheating, but I've learned it's important to be creative in solving problems."" For that he gets an extra half-star. 3 stars."

REAL SPACE. Not Your Sci-fi Space Lite
™.
 And this is precisely 
the reason why you have to read real space memoirs, especially if you're a sci-fi fan.
 Space just got real, and it's meaner than you've ever thought.For those who don't know what I'm talking about – this is the review of Scott Kelly's memoir, and he is the cool dude who spent a year in space. 
The only such man.
 After having cancer. 
This guy? Whole new definition of awesome. 
So let's get to the reasons why you should read his book!
Reason #1. You Thought Lack Of Gravity Was Cool
Well... NOPE. 
Turns out? Doing everything without gravity is much harder.
 The lack of gravity will even break your body in time. It will reduce you to basically a squid. Did you know that? Let me give you a list of things that are absolute bullshit not completely true about being in space, and yet are constantly used in fictional space: 	✬ Hot sci-fi chicks gracefully moving around on spaceships? 
*buzzer sound*
 	✬ Long hair looking good in space? 
*buzzer sound*
 	✬ Scratch that. Hair in general looking good? Even staying clean and being washed?
 *buzzer sound*
 	✬ Toned muscular bodies in space? 
*buzzer sound*
 	✬ Actually, rethink everything you've ever read about people eating on no-gravity spaceships. And about fresh food on spaceships. 	✬ A quick suit up before going out of the ship? 
Man, forget it! N+1 hours!
 	✬ I will not begin ANY SUCH conversation about sexual activity in space because you do not want to think about fluid dynamics OR the lack of weight you're experiencing. Neither do I.Personally, I loved finding out about this. We don't give the real space dudes enough credit! Because sci-fi makes it seem soooo easy. That's the last thing it is.
Reason #2. We Need To Debunk The Myth That Only Perfect People Can Be Astronauts... Or Do Other Demanding Jobs
Actually, I thought that only 20:20 vision ripped young boys and girls go to space. Probably, so did you.(Okay, so, buzzer GIFs are a little harder to find, apparently.)Turns out, nope – young folks don't go to space. 
ALMOST AT ALL.
 That is another lie by the media, fed to us to think that only youngsters can do anything in life, and if you're not doing it, you're living your life all wrong.
 Wanna know what gets people to space? Hard work.
 Years of it. Most people go to space sub-40. By that time, they probably don't have 20:20 vision anymore. They don't have perfect health either. 
Forget the myth that your life ended when you weren't a 20-something. 
People went to space after having cancer! People went to space with glasses. Wanna know what? If you're short, you're a preference for going to space! Ha. I found all of that 
incredibly
 empowering.
Reason #3. You Need To Restore Belief In Humanity
Okay, so... The political arena these days is not something I want to even remotely hear about. 
Most days, I either think the world will self-implode, or just keep embarrassing itself.
Which is why I found it unbelievably uplifting to know that while we squabble about whose president is less qualified for their job or... more qualified for totalitarian world domination, the 
Russians and Americans quietly work as a team on the International Space Station. 
Turns out, the Americans can't even go to space without the Russians. They have been going to space on a Russian ship for aaaaages now that the Shuttle has been decomissioned. Fancy that, huh? So much for diplomacy... This is the true team spirit of advancing humanity. 
#science, baby! 
I think Scott Kelly puts it better than me, so check out this quote:""When people ask whether the space station is worth the expense, this is something I always point out. What is it worth to see two former bitter enemies transform their weapons into transport for peaceful exploration and the pursuit of scientific knowledge? What is it worth to see former enemy nations turn their warriors into crewmates and lifelong friends? This is impossible to put a dollar figure on, but to me it’s one of the things that makes this project worth the expense, even worth risking our lives.""
Reason #4. The Book Empowers People From Humble Origins

Scott Kelly tells of a childhood with a heavily drinking father
 – an experience I'm also familiar with – and it's truly great to hear that high achievers can be people just like me, people who might have often felt that achievements are for ""the better kind"", the kind of people who come from proper homes (you'd be surprised how many children of alcoholics silently feel this way!) Side by side, he tells two stories – one of actually being in space, and one of preparing himself to go there – 
the road of a kid who nearly flunked highschool and had undiagnosed ADHD to becoming an astronaut.

Reason #5. The Book Tries To Make You See How Much You Should Respect The Planet
(image courtesy: NASA)An astronaut can't fail to understand the fragility of the Earth. No astronaut has ever come back to Earth and said, to hell with global warming, it doesn't exist! (I mean, I sure hope none of them did...)
Scott Kelly tries to show us how beautiful, how loving and comfortable our home world is.
 It's directly visible, juxtaposed to the coldness, vastness and inhabitability of space. It baffles you how powerless we really are out there – for all our almighty hubris. 
Which is why we need to nurture and protect what we have here.
I thank Scott Kelly and Knopf Publishing Group for giving me an early copy of this book in exchange to my honest opinion.Read Post On My Blog | My Bookstagram | Bookish Twitter"
2,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28397995-nancy,5,"The worst argument I ever had with my dad when I was growing up was over astronauts. We were at the dinner table and I had remarked that astronauts had to be superior and my dad argued that they had to be 'normal'. Dad thought that normal meant a human body that functioned as it was supposed to, and I thought superior meant they had abilities--physical and cognitive--that most of us don't have.After reading Endurance by Scott Kelly I stand by my pre-teen opinion. What Kelly achieved and what he endured was amazing. Few of us have the will and the commitment to pursue our dream when things get tough. Most of us settle for good enough, unable to push ourselves past what we consider our 'limits'. Nothing stopped Kelly. Nothing.Unlike his twin brother Mark, also an astronaut, Scott was an indifferent student until he knew what he wanted. Tom Wolfe's book The Right Stuff  about the first astronauts was the fire that lit his imagination and gave him a vision of what he wanted. He applied himself to his studies and was thrilled to become a Navy jet pilot, then a test pilot, and finally an astronaut. He never said 'no' to a mission, and found himself on the Endeavor and finally on the International Space Station (ISS) for a year.In his book Endurance we learn the behind the scenes life of an astronaut, the grueling training and vast amounts of information that must be learned, including Russian. It involves pain and adult diapers, the mundane yet sophisticated duty of cleaning an ISS toilet,  getting along with others in tight quarters, unexpected breakdowns, and long, draining space walks where every move must be considered and planned. The book is detailed. Don't expect Endurance to be an easy, joyride read, but I myself was fascinated. in alternating chapters, we learn about Scott's life and career and about his year on the ISS.  Scott has a scientific mind and his drive and ambition are evident. Don't expect a warm, fuzzy persona. Scott does talk about his brother Mark and the tragic shooting of his wife, Gabby Gifford, and her recovery but he is not telling Mark's story. Along with Scott's family, they are included in context of Scott's story. It was fascinating to learn about the astronauts Scott served with on his missions, especially those from other countries, and how the Russian space program differs from NASA. The Russian and American astronauts on the ISS depend on each other for survival and their trust and respect for each other is essential. (If only we on Earth saw our planet as a big spaceship which we share!)What does it take to be a success, to fulfill your highest potential? Scott had no fear and saw risky situations as challenges to overcome. He believed that he was part of something bigger than himself, adding to our knowledge and understanding so that someday humankind could travel to Mars. He believed that if humanity works together there is no end of what we can achieve. He believed in himself. He believed in the talents of his fellow astronauts.I was thrilled to be given a copy of Endurance from Bookish First To Read in exchange for a fair and unbiased review. "
3,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2473504-jennifer,3,"Endurance: A Year in Space, A Lifetime of Discovery is a memoir written by Scott Kelly. A former NASA astronaut, Scott Kelly is best known for spending nearly a year on the International Space Station (ISS) and (as of October 2015) for spending more time in space than any other American. He's also a former military fighter pilot and test pilot, an engineer, a retired U.S. Navy captain, a twin to another NASA astronaut Mark Kelly, a father, a son, and an ex-husband. This book is not only about Scott and his year in space. It's about all of the above. It's about his upbringing, his inspiration past and present, the other career roles that have served as stepping stones, the sacrificing family that watched him leave the planet over and over for work, the toll outer space takes on the body, mind, and relationships, and it's about Russia, science, perspective, and gratitude.Overall, I found Endurance to be a well-rounded memoir that covered many more topics than I expected. Based on my personal reading experience, many sections felt dry which caused me to pause the audiobook (narrated by Scott himself) several times due to a lack of engagement; however, a few parts were surprisingly touching and made up for it. My favorite parts included the exploration of relationship factors suffered by Scott and his now ex-wife as a result of the sacrifices required by this career, the physical accommodations necessary when in space (things many of us surely take for granted), and the nightmarish reaction Scott's body had upon his return to earth after almost a year of no gravity. Endurance is a perfect title for this book.My favorite quote:""I've learned that following the news from space can make Earth seem like a swirl of chaos and conflict, and that seeing the environmental degradation caused by humans is heartbreaking. I've also learned that our planet is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen and that we're lucky to have it.""Photo Source: www.nasa.gov"
4,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25852459-deanna,5,"All the stars for this one, fittingly. Best read of the year, and more. I want to write a love song to this one but am not up to it. I do keep wondering if this was written completely by Kelly or with a ghost writer. It doesn’t matter to me, I just wonder how to place my abundance of kudos. If Kelly, not a professional writer, created this on his own I want to shower his with the praise. If he worked with another writer, I want to tell them that they did a fantabulous job making this seem so real, intimate, and true that there is nothing about this book that feels co-written. However it came to be, I place this book firmly on the on yes I’ll read it again pile. I listened, and Kelly did a great job narrating his own book. Now I have the hardback and will let my eyeballs do the work on the next round, glad I already have Kelly’s voice in my head. You know that old question about naming 3 people you most want at your table for dinner. Kelly is now one of them. "

AIN'T it enough they have turned this planet earth into Hell already?Beside natural factors that create the scarcity of food,drinking water and adequate shelter is wars that increase that scarcity far more seriously.Wars certainly responsible to the misery we are witnessing : widespread of hunger,disease, death and destruction.But shameful greed resulting in shameful distribution of land and other natural resources (a tiny number of nobles jelously guarding a gigantic hoard of wealth , leaving the rest of the sweating humanity scrambling for the tiny amount of breadscrumb ) also increasing the seriousness of this mess to a calamity proportion.

Mosquito and HIV viruses are only two among countless diseaes causing agents among those mentioned above (beside the nobles and high priests,this last two are the toughest ,they do not harm people ditectly like viruses and insects but indirectly through their vicious,selfish and ruthless social,politiical ,militarial and foreign policies)We must not allow to waste more money and human resources in this shameful war game that the sinister Ruling Gang together with the two wicked elements mentioned above are playing."
6,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7788355-karen-s-library,5,"Wow! 5 gazillion stars to this amazing memoir by Astronaut Scott Kelly. I loved this even more the second time around. I met both Scott and now wife Amiko a couple of years ago and I was utterly starstruck. Original review: When Scott Kelly spent his year in space, I followed him on social media and was in awe over his earth art photos that he took and posted daily! I watched his interviews from the space station, his antics as a space gorilla, and everything I could. I cried with relief when I watched him land safely again back on earth. During that year, space looked fun, although weird. Social media never really portrayed any of the hardships or danger these brave men and women were going through every single moment.In his memoir, Scott gives his full insights of what space, living in the space station, and getting there, is really like, and if I admired this man before, I'm absolutely enamored by him and all of the astronauts of NASA! Scott really holds nothing back and we get the true story of what he endured during his career as an astronaut. I couldn't get enough of this book, and finished it at 2:30 AM because I didn't want to put it down last night. While reading, I had quite a few moments of cackling loudly at one of his crazy dreams or humorous pranks, and at other times, tears would be running as he told of the day his sister-in-law Gabby Gifford was shot or other tragedies of the space program. We find out the day he decided he wanted to be an astronaut, and about his early days as a pilot. He does talk about his twin brother Mark, also an astronaut, but only as the fact that Mark was his brother. This was Scott's story, not Mark's. Yes, there were lots of technical terms, and many details of science and regular maintenance issues like fixing the toilet. But we also get to see how hard spacewalks really are, how hard being in space is on their bodies, both during and after space flight. And we get to see the camaraderie the entire crew of the international space program experiences. American, Russian, Italian, Japanese, etc. There is so much respect and friendship between them all.Before I got to the 2nd chapter, I found out that Scott narrates the audiobook, so had to buy and download that too. I loved hearing him tell some of these stories himself and would switch back and forth between print and audio depending on what I was doing. I get to meet Scott Kelly at a book event next month, and I'm so thrilled and can't wait!"
7,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/321673-jamie-collins,3,"I very much enjoyed the details of life on the space station, and I liked the discussion of some of the differences between NASA and Roscosmos.I was a little put off, however, by the negative tone of the book. Even the title must rankle with other astronauts who would give anything to “endure” a year in space, yet that’s a good description of Kelly’s experience as related here. I think he was just trying to be realistic, but his complaints seemed effusive and heartfelt while he only gave only lip service to the wonders of this unique experience.Kelly has positive things to say about all of his fellow astronauts, except he mentions being troubled by poor Lisa Nowak (who later famously tried to kidnap a fellow astronaut’s girlfriend), and, oddly, he repeatedly calls out Tim Kopra over a minor idiosyncrasy. It seems unnecessary to have named Kopra, since the anecdote would have worked just as well anonymously. I’m kind of hoping it’s an inside joke between them.The story of his year in space is alternated with vignettes from his earlier life and career. I think I would have liked the book more if it had focused more closely on his time on the space station. The intimate details of his relationships with his family members seemed uncomfortably extraneous."
8,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5364077-connie-g,5,"Astronaut Scott Kelly wrote a stellar memoir about his year in the International Space Station. He also tells about his adventurous childhood, and his years of training to become an engineer, a fighter pilot, and a test pilot. Both Scott and his twin brother, Mark, were selected to be astronauts and they each completed four spaceflights.Scott appreciates the cooperation and genuine friendships that developed among the astronauts from the US, Russia, and other countries. He's in awe of the beauty he sees looking at the earth from the windows of the space station. He also realizes that he's missing special times with the people he loves back home when he's up in space, and how hard it is for his family. The astronauts exhibit amazing intelligence, and calmness under pressure where one false step can sometimes lead to death. Scott and Mark are involved in a medical twin study to see if Scott's year in space has long-term effects on his health.Scott has a good sense of humor, and is a wonderful storyteller. This memoir is highly recommended, especially for readers interested in space and science."
9,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12209967-holly-socolow,4,"Endurance, the aptly borrowed title documenting Shackleton’s year in Antarctica , is about Scott Kelly’s record-breaking year on the International Space Station (ISS) and the challenges therein. I ended up reading the first half and listening to the second half of the book due to new release availability at my library. I found reading the book easier to follow with the chapters alternating in time between his present mission on the ISS, and his formative family experiences and years of training as an officer and pilot. The audio book seemed to blend more together partly due to Scott’s matter-of-fact reading.My takeaway-- there is nothing romantic about being an astronaut on the ISS for a year other than the incredible feat of making it as an astronaut and those times of looking out the window of the cupola and seeing the unfiltered planet Earth and the universe! He and the other stream of astronauts from all over the world coming and going worked very hard every day doing whatever NASA or their particular mission control told them to do -- anything from fixing toilets to taking their own blood, performing dentistry, growing lettuce and dissecting mice, all in zero gravity. Oh yes, and harrowing space walks. Yikes. It was fascinating to learn about the day to day life on the ISS and the many many things we take for granted on Earth, like setting an object down and having it stay there, the sensation of rain on the skin, the taste of fresh vegetables, and the comfort of a soft pillow. It was wonderful hearing about what a truly international collaboration and accomplishment the ISS was and still is. The importance of the astronauts’ missions and the appreciation of their unique place in history resulted in life-supporting collaboration superseding power politics and petty arguments that so needlessly consume much of humanity just 250 miles below. "
10,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23100707-jean,4,"This is Kelly’s memoir of his year on ISS (International Space Station). Kelly has done four trips to ISS. This year long stay was part of a medical experiment to discover what effects time in space had on the human body. Scott’s identical twin brother, Mark Kelly, stayed on earth as a control subject. Kelly is a Navy Captain, fighter pilot and an engineer. It was fun to learn about the day to day information about life on ISS.The book is well written. Kelly also described the difference between a shuttle astronaut and a space station astronaut. Kelly told about his problems in school, particularly high school. He apparently had problems with the ability to stay focused on what he was supposed to learn. He told about what triggered his desire to learn and achieve as well as what provided him with a goal to work for. If you are at all interested in the astronaut program or space, this book is for you.I read this as an audiobook downloaded from Audible. The book is thirteen hours and six minutes. Scott Kelly does an okay job narrating the book."
11,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48328025-megs-bookrack,5,"All the stars in the universe! As memoirs go, this is top-notch! If you like science, you need to read this book. I listened to the audiobook, narrated by Scott Kelly himself, and was hooked from start to finish. For me personally, I find it very hard to critique a memoir. I mean, it is that person's story, it is up to them how they choose to tell it. This being said, even if I was a better reviewer I would have a hard time finding anything to critique within this book. Detailing everything from his childhood, his navy pilot training and career, astronaut training and numerous space missions, this book is replete with interesting facts and stories. I didn't want it to end - I flew through it and recommend it for everyone. Scott Kelly has lived one hell of a life and you should learn about it!"
12,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22606267-rebecca,4,"I received a free copy of this e-book from the publisher (via NetGalley) in exchange for an honest review.I’m an absolute sucker for astronaut biographies, so I had to read this. There haven’t been a ton of books written by astronauts who have flown on the ISS. Scott Kelly is a Shuttle astronaut as well as a Russia-launched ISS astronaut, so he speaks about spaceflight from multiple perspectives. His military background comes across strongly in the way he writes – straight forward, tell it like it is. I initially had a hard time getting into this one, but I became engrossed at about the 30% mark, then tore through the rest. For those expecting a book just about the Year in Space program, you may come away disappointed. The book really wasn’t centered on that program, and he didn’t really give a lot of detail about what went on, experiment wise. He does talk a lot about life on the ISS, so that was very interesting. We get his life story, his military career story and the story of how he was selected to be an astronaut. This book gave the best descriptions about life on the ISS that I’ve encountered so far. It was really neat to see the difference between how the Russian modules are run versus the US run modules. I think this book will appeal to non-fiction fans, especially those interested in NASA, the ISS and space science. I’m not sure this will appeal to a wide variety of people, but it is what it is. "
13,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30181442-yun,5,"When I was a kid, I wanted to be an astronaut (like pretty much every other kid out there). To hear that Scott Kelly volunteered to spend a year in space to advance science and to further the mission to Mars completely thrilled the kid still in me. This book of his experiences during that year spent in the International Space Station, along with his journey to get there, is absolutely fascinating and inspirational. Kelly writes with the clear-eyed and straightforward voice of a scientist. Yet his story is never boring; in fact, it's quite the opposite. No matter what he's talking about, he makes it interesting, such as the superstitious steps taken before launch, what it's like to capture the SpaceX Dragon with a robotic arm, how it feels when multiple rockets holding much needed supplies burned or never made it to ISS, the logistics of everyday life in zero gravity, what it's like to do spacewalks, and so much more.It's not often a book comes along that captures my imagination and makes me want to reach for the stars. I'm so glad Kelly wrote this book of his extraordinary experiences. It's an absolute joy to read and will go down as one of my all-time favorites!"

This in no way impacted my opinions of this book.*Astronauts are always going to be a mystery to me. After all, there's nothing really on earth that can compare to visiting the stars, for however long or short a time. Kelly's journey to becoming an astronaut as well as his year aboard the ISS is nothing short of amazing. Yet, at the same time, it helped de-mystify this illusive group to me - astronauts are people too, and they only get to where they are as a result of incredibly hard work and determination. Definitely buying this one for my library, and I'd recommend it to space lovers I know as well!"

18,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5630113-audrey,3,"3.5 starsI accidentally put this on hold while looking for Shackleton’s book, but that turned out for the best. Scott Kelly was inspired by Shackleton when creating his own memoir. Kelly is a present-day astronaut, most recently spending a year in space at the ISS to be a guinea pig and learn what long-term space living does to the body. He was on his way to juvenile delinquency when he read The Right Stuff. It moved him so much, he turned his life around and worked hard to become an astronaut.He alternates his memoir between the year in space and his life journey to becoming an astronaut. The year in space is told in present tense; the past is told in past tense.I realized that I have not learned a lot about the modern space age; I know little about the space shuttle. Kelly is quite a different astronaut from the Mercury and Apollo astronauts. It’s interesting to see how things have changed.Contains some strong language."
19,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6277675-monnie,5,"Almost every review of this book, I'll bet, will begin something like this: ""When I was a kid, outer space was fascinating...I dreamed of being an astronaut."" I wholeheartedly agree with the first part; it was true of me then - back in the '50s when the National Aeronautics and Space Administration was founded, and it is true now that I've reached septagenerian status. But beyond that, flying 900 feet in the air under a parasail firmly attached to a heavy cable is about as high as I ever want to go (and don't care to go ever again, thank you very much). Besides that, just thinking about stuffing my body into one of those capsules that carry astronauts to and from terra firma makes me break out in a cold sweat.Truth is, I'm quite content to read about other people's experiences - and this account is one of the best I've encountered since Tom Wolfe's 1979 classic, The Right Stuff. So I was pleasantly surprised to learn that Wolfe's book served as the impetus that turned Kelly's life around - from a kid who had no plans for his future and didn't much care for education to one singularly focused on a very lofty and difficult-to-reach career goal and knew education was the key to reaching it. In this book, Kelly, who holds the American record for consecutive days spent in space, tells it like it really was - both in his personal and professional life. For those who might not know, he is the twin brother of astronaut Mark Kelly, also the husband of Arizona Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, who survived an assassination attempt in 2011. The prologue of the book hooked me immediately: now back on earth for 48 hours, Kelly was suffering the effects of a return to gravity after a year of looking down on civilization as we know it from the International Space Station (which he notes is today the longest-inhabited structure in space by far and the largest peacetime international project in history).That's impressive in and of itself, but along the way - maybe because I spent my youth in the throes of the Cold War, crossing my fingers that school desks would protect me from a nuclear blast - I was blown away by one comment in particular: That Kelly found himself heading to space with two Russian companions, all of whom not that long ago might have been ordered to kill each other. Now, their very lives depended on total cooperation and trust.Chapters shift from Kelly's pre-astronaut years to his experiences on four space flights including his final mission aboard the ISS. Although I'm sure he left out plenty of classified details, he pulls no punches when it comes to describing what it's really like in a confined space in zero gravity (right down to how human waste is contained and what happens to any of it that isn't). Some happenings are day-to-day routine and others have the potential to make the writing of this book not a happening thing, but all share a common bond: not a single one is boring. I finished the book as fast as I could, and when I got to the last page, I wished there were more to read. As I said at the beginning, space - and Kelly's part of exploring it - are nothing short of fascinating.Now that his in-space voyages have come to an end, to Kelly I say thank you for your service and your wonderful book. Oh yes, and one other thing. Live long and prosper!"

Some of his stories made me laugh out loud. It did kind of drag for me near the end, but his book sparked my interest in the ISS, NASA, and a possible mission to mars."
21,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17501320-helga-cohen,5,"  Endurance was a memoir by Kelly about his record-breaking year on the International Space Station (ISS) and the challenges. The book alternates chapters from his present mission and his years of training as an officer and pilot and his family life. It touches on the Challenger and Columbia explosions and his sister-in law Gabby Gifford getting shot. Scott has an identical twin, Mark (also an astronaut) so the twin studies are groundbreaking science to compare him after a year in space. Tom Wolfe’s book The Right Stuff influenced Scott’s decision to become an astronaut. I just loved reading about him and his experiences. He did such an excellent job with this autobiography. I learned so much about being an astronaut, the space missions, and a year on ISS. He volunteered to spend a year in space to advance science and to further the mission to a projected trip to Mars. The year in space was for the advancement of science. It was to discover how the body is affected by long term space flights on the body and mind. The ISS has been the longest peaceful International collaboration in history. What an accomplishment. I learned so much about what astronauts go through to live on ISS and about the hardships of life without gravity. This was a riveting story and written in a straightforward manner. If you are interested in aeronautics, space, and learning about astronauts you’ll like this book. I loved it."
22,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5456932-tony,3,"In alternating chapters Scott Kelly tells the story of his remarkable year in space on the ISS, and of the life and career that put him there. He’s obviously led an interesting life and has accomplished so much, and he recounts plenty of stories and fascinating facts about living in space (yes, including toilet stuff). But there’s something missing. Despite the amazing things he’s seen/done/felt, he tells his story in such a flat, matter of fact way, with no real sense of wonder, personality, or emotion. I guess that’s to be expected, we can’t have our fighter pilots and astronauts getting all emotional, can we? Not until the last couple of chapters, when he talks about coming home, do we get a real sense of how he felt. "
23,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5829233-michelle-mallette,3,"Scott Kelly has spent 340 continuous days on the International Space Station - more than any other American astronaut. That record is likely to stand for a while, since his honesty and candour in describing the experience could give other candidates second thought! Along with Russian cosmonaut Mikhail “Misha” Kornienko, there for the same length of time, and other astronauts on shorter missions, Kelly faced mind-blowing challenges while maintaining the ISS and conducting numerous science experiments, including on their own bodies. Kelly, with the help of co-author Margaret Lazarus Dean, alternates chapters between a narrative of his time on the ISS with a biographical take that dates back to his rough childhood in New Jersey with twin brother Mark (famously also an astronaut). He makes no apologies for being a military fighter pilot first, one who initially resisted the idea of a months-long mission on the ISS. Over several missions, he develops respect and appreciation for the work of scientists, though he peppers his book with criticisms of the bureaucracy of NASA and the Russian space agency. The writing is solid, and it’s interesting reading, but doesn’t get quite the recommendation I’d give to Chris Hadfield’s biography, a shorter but a more powerful memoir. I found Kelly’s impatience and complaints wearying, even occasionally arrogant. Read it yourself and let me know what you think.

My ThoughtsScott Kelly’s life story is inspiring. From his early life, to his decision to become an astronaut, to the year he spent on the International Space Station, this is one man’s amazing narrative. I am definitely a fan of science fiction, but to actually “ride along” on an astronaut’s journey, well, that was better than any fiction I could read. So few have seen our world from an astronaut’s perspective and Mr. Kelly does a wonderful job providing insight regarding the incredible physical and mental challenges he faced. I always assumed that anyone who became an astronaut would have been an incredibly high achiever from a very early age. Mr. Kelly proved me wrong as he initially was far from being an ideal candidate for the job. He talks honestly about his personal shortcomings as well as what it is like on the Space Shuttle and the ISS. His life and journeys are presented in an engaging, easy to read format and as a space nerd, I was hooked. If you are fascinated by space, this book is for you. If you love an inspirational story where a man sets his sights on what would seem to be an unattainable goal, this book is for you.I was fortunate to win this book through a BookishFirst giveaway! Thank you, Scott Kelly, BookishFirst and the Knopf Publishing Group for the opportunity to read and review this remarkable book."
25,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2377230-emily,5,"The best non-fiction book I have read in a long time. A few months ago I was watching a documentary on PBS about Scott Kelly and the effects that living on the International Space Station (ISS) had on his body after an entire year. Scott has an identical twin (also an astronaut) and so it was groundbreaking science to be able to compare him to his twin after the year in space - the goal being to learn how to humans could adapt to a space flight to Mars.This book covers Scott Kelly's life - from becoming a fighter pilot to the year on the ISS. It touches on the Challenger and Columbia explosions and on his sister-in-law Gabby Gifford getting shot. I learned so much about what astronauts go through just for the chance to go up to the ISS and about the hardships of life without gravity. Because the ISS is a global partnership the book touches on the differences between the difference space agencies - mainly NASA and Russia. Where NASA is methodical and tedious (sometimes to a ridiculous degree), the Russians are completely opposite and it makes for some interesting reading.I highly recommend the book. It's written in a very straightforward manner, easy to understand, and Scott Kelly has a great sense of humor. If you're interested in space, science, aeronautics, etc you need to read this book. "
26,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5056662-figgy,0,"Review to come. I did listen to the audio for large chunks of it, narrated by Scott himself, and I found this added a nice element to an already very personable and interesting story.Chapters alternate between the ""now"" (2016) in which Scott spent almost a year on the ISS, and his journey from a kid through to NASA's decision to send him up for this mission, and there is plenty of humour and heart."
27,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6874323-thomas-ray,3,"DISGUSTINGThe international space station has mold growing on the walls. There’s no water to wash hands—or anything else. Most of the water the occupants have to drink is the imperfectly-processed urine of the group. The less said about defecating in zero gravity, the better. Any object that drifts off—be it an important tool or a blob emanating from a human body or laboratory animal—will float to who-knows-where, and stay there. The author went months without changing clothes. The carbon dioxide level is headache-inducing, cognition-impairing. The space station has been continuously occupied for nearly 20 years.CALLOUSNASA repeatedly ignored astronaut pleas to /permit the astronauts to turn on/ enough carbon-dioxide scrubbers to keep them from having constant headaches. Station air was 4% carbon dioxide. On Earth, it’s 0.04% (up from 0.035% in the mid-1900s, the extra .005% melting the icecaps). NASA ignored its engineers’ pleas not to launch the Challenger space shuttle in cold weather, when the O-rings could fail: the crew died. NASA ignored the problem of insulation hitting and damaging thermal tiles on the shuttle. The Columbia crew died. NASA retired its old, unsafe shuttles. Since then NASA has been contracting with the USSR and with private companies to rocket astronauts into space. In the year Scott Kelly was in orbit, two such rockets blew up; a third spun out of control. It’s just luck that these three were unmanned resupply ships. They were getting low on supplies, but nobody died this time. Of Scott Kelly’s group of 44 astronaut trainees, 5 had died by the time Kelly wrote this book. Human life and health is a disposable commodity, to NASA. Just as with the military generally. Counting his time as a jet pilot from an aircraft carrier, and a military test pilot, and as an astronaut, Kelly says over 40 of his friends and colleagues have died in crashes. The space station is constantly hit by tiny meteors and bits of space junk. The exterior is riddled with what look like bullet holes. It’s a miracle that the whole thing hasn’t depressurized. It’s also damaged by solar radiation. Metal bends like potato chips. While Kelly was in orbit, a large piece of space junk whizzed by with a closing speed of over 17,000 miles per hour. Mission control didn’t find out about it until too late to try to move out of the way. It came close, but, just luckily, missed. One of the main “experiments” being done during Kelly’s time in space was to see how his health is damaged by a long time in space. It’s not just astronauts who are endangered. Space stations, ships, satellites that are allowed to “burn up in the atmosphere” don’t completely burn up. Huge chunks of metal slam into the Earth at tremendous speeds. LITTLE TO GAINYes, they dissect mice in zero g, and grow a bit of lettuce, fill up their time doing any experiment anyone can think of to put in orbit. Even schoolchildren were invited to send experiments to space. But there’s little to gain. The experiments are a pretext and afterthought. Kelly repeatedly says they’re preparing to go to Mars. But there’s nothing on Mars for us. It will never be habitable. Nor will the moon.MILITARY POSTURINGThe real reason all the countries have sent military personnel—the astronauts from all countries are military pilots, even though there is no piloting to be done, either of the rocket or the space station itself; everything is controlled by software—is to maintain a claim to the high ground. Don’t let another country’s military get the drop on you. Kelly doesn’t tell us this—but it’s always been true. We went to the moon as a game of one-upsmanship versus the Soviets. There was nothing on the moon we needed. Kelly does admit that the reason NASA sent Kelly to space for a year was that the Russians had sent someone to space for a year. AND that the Russians did so not for any particular reason: their schedule just worked out that way!!FALSE HOPEThe idea that we could one day reach an M-class planet, so it won’t matter if we destroy Earth, is a false hope and a very dangerous one.ILLUSION OF ACHIEVEMENTThe achievement of absurdly unlikely goals—putting somebody on the moon and bringing him back (even though the trip is entirely pointless) fosters a false attitude that people can do anything. And that Top Men are figuring everything out. The reality is that the space program is a hugely expensive military stunt, that takes us away from addressing our real problems. Scott Kelly is a cheerleader for achieving hard goals; he’s completely uncritical that the goals he’s pursued are worse than pointless.Quiz questions:goodreads.com/trivia/work/50213713-en..."
28,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2930764-marie,5,"I've never had a burning desire to leave my home planet, but being a kid of the '80s, the space program has always intrigued me. My interests may still be childlike: how do astronauts pee, cut hair, and drink coffee in zero gravity, and the like. Scott Kelly, in his ultra direct manner, kindly enlightened me on all counts, plus many I hadn't considered (like how long it takes to prepare for a space walk). His memoir is told in dual time: most chapters cover bits of his yearlong mission on the International Space Station, as well as stories from his life and the journey toward becoming an astronaut. I especially like that Kelly is very honest about the difficulty of leaving your family and loved ones behind on Earth--important information for anyone aspiring to travel to Mars (something Kelly believes is imminent). I also like his honesty about his formative years--he scraped by in high school and was told that he wouldn't amount to much, and certainly didn't have what it takes to work for NASA. It's the sort of experience that could inspire many young people! Kelly's insights were so interesting and thorough. Listening to this surprisingly personal memoir was almost always fascinating, and I really enjoyed living vicariously on the ISS through this very open memoir! Also, I appreciate that among Kelly's favorite things about returning to Earth were such simple things such as fresh water, and the myriad sounds and smells that fill our days."
29,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75854317-laura-peden,4,"A really cool memoir by astronaut Scott Kelly, the veteran of four space flights and the American record holder for consecutive days spent in space. This was a relatively long audiobook - 13 hours/400 pages, however I flew through this in one day. This was totally out of my comfort zone but I’m so glad I hit play. Listened via Libby, speed 1.55x"
30,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3030161-ericka-seidemann,5,"Wow. Just, wow.  This memoir is a page-turner from start to finish, and I appreciated that it wasn't structured chronologically, but rather followed Kelly's storytelling with flashbacks and flashforwards to create a riveting narrative.  Endurance is not just about Kelly's time on the ISS, but also delves into the training that led up to his becoming an astronaut. All of Kelly's experiences, from his time as an EMT on an ambulance to his career in the military flying fighter jets, contributed to his skill of calm focus in the face of extremes necessary to command the ISS. He also gives credit to those who molded and guided him on his journey, including his mom, who became the first female police officer in their home town of West Orange, New Jersey.  As ""civilians,"" we're fortunate to have this intimate glimpse into day-to-day life in space, and how the astronaut-adventurers come together to handle adversities, from space walk repairs to those dreaded phone calls from earth that something may be wrong with their loved ones back home. Endurance provides food for thought about our relationships with other nations and how precious our home planet truly is.  I had to carry a book of tape flags with me while reading this because I had to mark so many eye-opening passages that I didn't want to forget. I tortured my family with expositions and factoids that began, ""Listen to this, I read in Scott Kelly's book . . . ""  Without a doubt, you want to read this.  Many thanks to BookishFirst and Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group for the copy in exchange for my honest review. "
31,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33718320-samantha-colwell,3,"I received a copy of this book from Penguin Random House for an honest review.Scott Kelly's Endurance is a study in human achievement and the ISS is really the star of the show. Don't get me wrong--Scott Kelly is an interesting, personable, funny narrator, and his memoir is cohesive and strong. But the international space station, the way it functions and its purpose, is the most fascinating part of the novel. Endurance takes us in alternating chapters between episodes on the ISS and Kelly's life on earth: growing up with his twin brother, stressing in school over mediocre grades, the typical ""I wasn't great in school, but now I'm an astronaut"" thing. In spite of the fact that this book is about Kelly and his life, I found myself scanning through these chapters and moving onto the space station fodder. I loved learning about how the station works--how Kelly and cohorts eat in space, commit routine tasks, sleep on rotation, the politics of how human bodies endure. The progression of what man can achieve in space is so important to catalogue, and Kelly's memoir will go far in helping us understand the physical and mental toll a year in space can take. "
32,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19389289-paige,4,"It was difficult to put this memoir by former astronaut Scott Kelly down. This is the story of a living hero who comes across as approachable and relatable while also inspiring awe. I had limited background knowledge of the International Space Station or spaceflight, yet I was able to enjoy this book. This contained a fair amount of details and technical descriptions, but I never felt overwhelmed. What made this such an appealing read was that we never lose sight throughout that this is the personal story of an extraordinary man. And as remarkable as his accomplishments are, Scott Kelly the person does not get swallowed up by them. They are part of his experiences and he shares more than sugar coated versions. It was also fascinating to learn details about things including what it is like to prepare to launch into space, to command a space shuttle, and to live in space for a year. This book made me appreciate the space program, earth, and the tenacity of the human spirit."
33,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51021142-katie,5,"I wish I could give this book even more stars! I have read several other books written by astronauts about their time in space and Endurance is, by far, my favorite. The number of details included in this story makes it a very interesting read. Scott adds in many unique insights about his life on the iss, what led him to becoming an astronaut, what he was thinking or experiencing during different times and describing what the technical procedures are for. I highly recommend this book if you are interested in learning details about training, what astronauts experience during launch/reentry and what it is like to live in space."

It's a real eye opener to read a true life experience of an Astronaut of our time. Scott Kelly has a lived a remarkable life. I found him to be surprisingly relatable. Contagious in spirit. Inspirational. Funny. A true soldier. Willing to risk his life for humanity. So grateful for all the Astronauts out there, and Russia for continuing to send people up to space. Definitely a must read!"

I think he has a lot to thank his ghostwriter for, as Kelly's voice comes through loud and clear. Fascinating life, amazing experiences. He strips away the ""glamour"" associated with astronauts, exposing instead the sheer hard work, professionalism, teamwork, pain and ingenuity required. A must read for anyone even slightly interested in what we are doing in space."

39,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2048986-carrie-kellenberger,5,"Captain Scott Kelly has been on four flights to space and he is the US record holder for consecutive number of days spent in space. I don't know of any other person who has lived a life similar to his except for his identical twin brother Mark Kelly, who is also a fighter pilot, captain, and astronaut. Both brothers are also New York Times best-selling authors. I started my 2018 reading journey on two books: Endurance: A Year in Space, A Lifetime of Discovery by Scott Kelly and A Column of Fire by Ken Follett. I have been reading Scott Kelly's book at night and Ken Follett's book during the day. I happened to finish this one first and my oh my - 6 STARS. My hero has kept his hero status - not that I ever doubted Scott Kelly for a second. I've watched him rise in his career for years and followed his last space adventure with abnormal curiosity and utter fascination. Endurance: A Year in Space, A Lifetime of Discovery is a captivating memoir of Scott's journey to space and back to Earth. It also recounts his years of work towards becoming a fighter pilot and his formative years. I loved his writing style and his simple accounts of life in Russia while he was preparing for his flights to space as well as his accounts of life aboard the International Space Station. Time and time again, I was amazed at his observations and his perspectives on leadership, courage under pressure, and the importance of teamwork. Even after reading his book, it is hard for me to wrap my brain around some of the challenges he endured during his year in space and how he kept his cool. From the challenges of taking off and landing to isolation from everything and everyone he knows on Earth to the effects of space on the human body, there are just so many things in this book that made me pause and think. I loved his descriptions of how many types of aircrafts he learned to fly and the endless take offs and landings he performed in order to make his journey to space. I loved the descriptions of his camaraderie with the Russian Cosmonauts in ISS and I marvel at how two countries that were once at war are now co-existing in the same space in SPACE.I loved his compassion, his passion for life, and his sense of humor. I loved that he was able to describe his moments of unease and pain and push through them towards to horizon. There was so much I loved about this book, it is hard to put it all into a review. I've color-coded the whole book for passages I want to refer back to, but in all likelihood, I'll be writing a second review again once I've had a change to reread it. The only thing that really left me feeling dissatisfied with this book is that Captain Kelly doesn't address his issues with being back on Earth. The prologue mentions his pain, swelling and rashes, but the end of the book doesn't mention if these space symptoms have subsided or not. I have often wondered if I'd feel pain in space, and he answers my question thoroughly, but I'd like to know more about how he has done now that he has been back on Earth. Did his symptoms subside? Did they get worse? I guess I'll have to wait for his next book to find out. Either way, this one unanswered question was minuscule in comparison to all the other questions he answered about his year in space. Bravo, Astronaut Scott Kelly!Endurance: A Year in Space, A Lifetime of Discovery is a true testament to the strength of human will and resilience and the endless glory of imagination. Kelly has led a remarkable life, he wrote an incredible book, and the underlying message of hope: to never give up, to always persist at what you want - these are all takeaway lessons that I will remind myself of daily. Thank you, Captain Kelly, for your constant messages of hope and for your bravery and dedication to humanity. Best Takeaway Quotes from my first read: “I've learned that an achievement that seems to have been accomplished by one person probably has hundreds, maybe even thousands, of people's minds and work behind it, and I've learned that it's a privilege to be the embodiment of that work.”― Scott Kelly, Endurance: A Year in Space, A Lifetime of Discovery“What is it worth to see two former bitter enemies transform weapons into transport for exploration and the pursuit of scientific knowledge? What is it worth to see former enemy nations turn their warriors into crewmates and lifelong friends? This is impossible to put a dollar figure on, but to me it’s one of the things that makes this project worth the expense, even worth risking our lives.”― Scott Kelly, Endurance: A Year in Space, A Lifetime of DiscoveryI was up here as the only American with two Russian guys for six weeks this summer...and if something had happened to me, I would have counted on them for my life. We have a great relationship, and I think the international aspect of this program has been one of its highlights.― Scott Kelly, Endurance: A Year in Space, A Lifetime of DiscoveryYet the story of how we kept the space station cool - a huge chunk of metal flying through space getting roasted by the unfiltered sun for forty-five minutes out of every ninety while its enormous solar arrays generate electricity - is a story of engineering triumph with important implications for future space flight.― Scott Kelly, Endurance: A Year in Space, A Lifetime of Discovery"

42,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2526638-claudia-turner,5,"Scott Kelly is one of those rare individuals you meet only a few times in your life who has both a wild passionate soul and keen, calculating sense. He’s like Spock and Kirk rolled into one unforgettable space explorer. The title is fitting because throughout the book he cites the original “Endurance” about Shackleton’s exploration to Antarctica a century ago. Today we have the ISS and astronauts working against government apathy no to mention our understanding of time and space in order to reach into unknown regions of the universe and find if and how we’ll get to Mars. It all starts with a little grit and a lot of determination and Kelly (and his twin brother astronaut Mark Kelly) embody these traits. I’ve read quite a few astronaut and space books the last few years and one thing I’ve noticed is how difficult it is for many astronauts to maintain healthy marriages and relationships in general. There’s a lot of moving and traveling and being MIA for significant life events thats can strain the strongest of relationships. A lot of them didn’t come from cookie cutter backgrounds either and had to surpass life barriers that would break many a man. While everyone has their own perspective on their lives and the people that shaped them, Kelly does his best to understand and relate to the people he left behind even if it seems to fall short at times, like with his ex wife. Yet Kelly had one year at the ISS so a lot of time to really deconstruct his past, his place on earth, and how he got to where he is, and I love this soul searching, introspective type of writing. I also love his sense of humor and appreciation for minute details like with the flowers and toilet upon the ISS. Any great man/woman knows that greatness can’t exist without a lot of time given to all that appears trivial and inconsequential. All the little moments and the mundane aspects of life must be cared for and nurtured before “greatness” can be achieved. I appreciate Kelly’s thoughtfulness, his compassion, and most of all his adventurous spirit. He’s a true modern day explorer, a candid philosopher of sorts, and he would have made Shackleton proud."

Kimberly is even hosting a buddy read of it in July for her #greatspaceread!Endurance is one of those space memoirs that is mostly about the human condition and not about the science. I suck at science, but I LOVED this book and could not stop listening. At its core, this book is about a man’s willingness to go to almost any length to be a human lab rat for NASA to better understand space and our place within it.Kelly and his twin brother allowed their DNA to be used for research to help us figure out how to get to Mars. Scott lived on the ISS for a year while his twin stayed in Earth. But before all of that, Scott was your average teenager who didn’t know what to do with his life or how to take school serious. Then he read a book that gave him a clear goal, and he didn’t stop until he achieved that goal: flying a space shuttle.This book is full of jaw dropping moments. Moments you wouldn’t believe except, well, they did happen to Scott! I highly recommend this book to everyone and think we all can learn so much from Scott’s story.If you are looking for more on Scott and this year in space mission, there is a Netflix docuseries called....wait for it... A YEAR IN SPACE. But don’t watch it and hope to pass Kimberly’s Endurance test. She’ll know you cheated and didn’t read it."

I find outer space fascinating I follow the flight paths of the International Space Station (ISS)(which oddly enough will be crossing over my home at 6:22 p.m. tonight, and I am planning on watching it travel along on its journey with my high power binoculars). This book adds to my fascination. Retired Astronaut Scott Kelly is the longest occupying American resident of the ISS with 340 straight days in 2015-2016. Endurance is his memoir of that record-breaking stay and the rest of his “Lifetime of Discovery.” Selected to a ""year-long mission"" starting with Expedition 43, he then commanded Expedition 44 and 45, Mr. Kelly had put into practice what it was like to live on the Space Station two years before with his 5 months stay on the ISS during Expedition 26. His life journey through hardships in his childhood, his service in the Navy as a Pilot, fighting Prostate Cancer and those months of Expedition 43 prepared him for what came next. Endurance is the closest I will ever get to space and I ate up every word Mr. Kelly wrote. His struggles from being away from his family, his relationships, his joys, his mental and physical health, working with various countries Astronauts delving in Biomedical Engineering, his vivid explanations of the day to day jobs he completed were like a sci-fi novel turned reality. Can you imagine what it would be like to look at the earth and see it in all its glory, it’s distinguishing attributes? You don’t have to, Mr. Kelly gives you his view and feelings on what it is like. He makes you feel as if you are there, working, playing and traveling through zero gravity. The knowledge that you don’t have control over anything that happens on earth to your family is something that Mr. Kelly finds out about when his sister-in-law Congresswoman Gabriella Giffords is shot in Arizona at a Safeway grocery store parking lot meeting with constituents. Mr. Kelly had a few months left of his stay. A few things of what Mr. Kelly says of that experience, while leading the nation in a moment of silence concerning the horrific assassination attempt and deaths of six people and 13 injured that day in Tucson struck me as something to really chew on and change, and also some huge foreshadowing, “Those of us who have had the privilege to look down on the Earth from space get the chance to take a larger perspective of the planet and the people who share it. I feel more strongly than ever that we must do better” He explains after the moment of silence ""on the space station, we followed our normal routine. But I knew that on Earth somethings would never be the same.” Mr. Kelly’s life experiences told throughout this book show everyone that someone can come from obscurity and land into whatever they dream of becoming and beyond those dreams. This book is worth reading especially if you have any inkling of journeying from your own life to someone else’s and obviously if you love space exploration. This book hits one of my top five memoirs. Read it, you won’t regret it. Thanks to Bookish First for sending me a copy of Endurance: A Year in Space, A lifetime of Discovery I thoroughly enjoyed it. This book was given to me in lieu of my honest opinion."
45,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12691311-debbie,5,"I liked this book a lot! It was very interesting and held my interest throughout. Scott Kelly is a very funny guy and I liked how put that into the book. I learned a lot about the space industry. Most of it, I didn’t know. I certainly didn’t realize that there are still astronauts and that we are using Russia’s facilities. I now a little secret about dill, as well. Ha!! I think it’s great that we are cooperating with Russia in order to learn more about space and the secrets it holds. So many different things that I learned about were very extraordinary. A really good book that I enjoyed very much. Thanks to Bookish for providing me with a free copy of the book (a hard copy) in order for me to review."
46,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4474787-mimi,4,"Not only is the title a nod to Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage and it is interwoven in Kelly's time on the space station, but the reason that Scott goes into NASA is Tom Wolfe's The Right Stuff. I loved that reading was so integral to this story and loved Kelly's voice, history, and observations. It could have been a dry tome and was pleasantly live. "
47,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12765668-linda,4,"Capt. Scott Kelly, USN, a US astronaut extraordinaire, tells the compelling story of his life’s journey from a modest and underachieving childhood, to reading a book that changed his life, to becoming a Navy test pilot, then being accepted, along with his twin brother Mark, into the space program, and eventually taking up residence on the International Space Station for a full year. What an amazing adventure story! Scott isn’t a professional writer, and he had someone (Margaret Lazarus Dean) co-write with him, but Endurance felt like Scott told it his way, showing his faults as well as his triumphs, and teaching his readers enough about space travel to feel like we were almost along for the ride with him. I liked it a lot, scientific jargon notwithstanding."
48,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1432957-alison,5,"I’ll never go to space, but this book is a great replacement. Kelly’s account of his career and year in space captivated me. His writing is sometimes conversational, sometimes polished and poetic. His reflections on life after a year at the International Space Station are worth returning to again and again. I have a new respect for what it takes—mentally, physically, emotionally—to be an astronaut. I’ll be recommending this one for a while. “I’ve learned that an achievement that seems to have been accomplished by one person probably has hundreds, maybe even thousands, of people’s minds and work behind it, and I’ve learned that it’s a privilege to be the embodiment of that work.”"
49,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28613204-sara,5,"Fascinating first-hand account of astronaut Scott Kelly’s year aboard the International Space Station (ISS) and the insights he gained about life, family, and the future. From being 18 and captivated by Tom Wolfe’s The Right Stuff, to setting lofty, personal academic and professional goals, Scott Kelly proves that you can do “hard things” when you set your mind to it. Great book!"
50,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6005592-elena,2,Wasn't a masterpiece. I had to skip a lot and got really bored toward the end. It could have worked better if someone else had written it.
51,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10074653-dana,5,"Excellent book! I loved learning about his training and education to become an astronaut, as well as his time on the ISS. He has a very relaxed, witty style of writing and I enjoyed the jokes thrown in. It also wasn't so technical that you couldn't understand what he was talking about on the ISS. Highly recommend!"
52,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67612372-megan,3,"Oh my god, astronauts are so much braver than I thought.You know–everyone knows–deep down, that astronauts are a little bit crazy. They voluntarily launch themselves away from Earth at the speed of sound on top of a rocket that might be a bomb if it’s not regulated or cooled properly or if a tiny bolt is out of place, so that they can go explore what happens to people in a place that is passively trying to kill them at all times. Scott Kelly and his Russian counterpart, Misha Kornienko, lived up there for a year. In an environment that was gravity-less, water-less, air-less…people-less. The maximum number of people who were on the International Space Station while the two of them were completing their year in space was nine. Nine people to substitute the entire human race.Kelly’s anecdotes about the life on the ISS are brutally real, but told in such a matter-of-fact way that you almost forget the dangers. He reminds you, of course, that something as simple as fixing the toilet is a project of vital importance and that if a single bolt or screw goes floating off into the depths of the station, it might be lost forever. But it’s also funny to think about someone having the fix the toilet that’s in space. Kelly doesn’t shy away from these bits of humor, and even finds ways to make the tales of life-and-death zero-g shenanigans lighthearted and interesting. But there’s an underlying intensity that feels sort of like what I imagine living in space might feel like: you have to laugh at the monstrous vacuum trying to kill you, otherwise it will be too overwhelming to continue.Interspersed with tales from the ISS are chapters of how Scott Kelly became an astronaut. It was a long journey for him, from terrible student to Navy test pilot to various NASA jobs–space shuttle pilot, astronaut liaison with the Russian space agency, and finally long-flight mission astronaut. It’s quite a wild ride with various colorful characters and it shows a great resilience in Kelly, a perseverance and a determination that are incredibly important qualities in an astronaut.This book was very accessible–all of the hard science was explained in terms simple enough that even the most English-major-y of nerds (me) could understand. There were some technical bits that were a bit dense, but it was well worth reading through them to understand just how difficult rocket science really is. Or…space station science, I suppose. Anyone who read and enjoyed Andy Weir’s The Martian will probably like this book for similar reasons–fascinating scientific and technological explanations interspersed with a quiet sense of humor and personal journey narrative that disperses the intensity of the situation, but doesn’t detract from it.I highly recommend this book for lovers of space, for anyone who grew up looking at the stars and wishing they could walk among them. Reading Endurance is a little bit like living vicariously through Scott Kelly–maybe you’re the not one going on spacewalks and floating over to the Russian module for Friday dinners, but the sense of wonder and kinship between humanity and the starts is closer and more real. It’s a fascinating look at life in space and what it takes to get there–determination, a good sense of humor, an unparalleled strength, bravery, and…well, endurance."
53,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33105402-tyson,5,"“There's a starman waiting in the skyHe'd like to come and meet usBut he thinks he'd blow our mindsThere's a starman waiting in the skyHe's told us not to blow itCause he knows it's all worthwhile”Scott Kelly defines hard work in his career path to becoming an astronaut. His book does every justice to explain how he reached a point in his life where he become one of the only human beings to have the privilege to spend an entire year in outer space. His writing is enough to make even a person with minimal interest in space exploration envious of his opportunity.This was Kelly’s first book, which is not surprising because he seems to have been rather busy in the years preceding it. He worked hard to overcome obstacles, both personal and professional. For the most part, he seems like a no-nonsense kind of guy, a man who understands that in order to reach goals, much of it is the perseverance to help yourself. It is a quality that holds high importance in space, where there is nobody to hold your hand and resolve issues for you. Kelly’s attitude is not only symbolic but a literal protocol in his journey through 340 days spent on the International Space Station.Anybody can write a book about what they do. Whether it is a politician or a professional ball player, autobiographies have the capability to let us into the minds and lives of people who live in ways most of us probably won’t ever experience. But Kelly’s book is different. It is harder to wrap your head around, a grossly more monumental production because of all it entails. He leaves the planet, lives primarily on his own, and is responsible for things that we, as gravity-stuck humans, only know nature for taking care of (like providing air to breathe or keeping our food on our plates). Things we don’t blink an eye at, he faced as trials and tribulations, inhibitions to simple tasks like eating, moving, sleeping, and basic life functions.Please take the time to read this book. Please find Kelly’s social media accounts (Instagram most importantly) and follow along. Kelly, who had to learn how to do so many things to further his career, his personal life, and his days in space, has seemed to naturally add another to his list when he wrote this autobiography. It is a wonderful addition to the adventurous genre of travel."
54,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27943513-brian-mccue,4,A brief biography of Scott Kelly's life and his recent year-long stay in the ISS. Intensely interesting if you've ever wondered how the International Space Station functions. Lots of insights about the actual science of space travel with an emphasis on the hardships and how they apply to traveling to Mars. This book will make you watch all your favorite sci/fi films and read all your sci/fi books in a new light. Space is scary. Real scary. 
55,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6014143-dena,3,I really liked Scott Kelly's memoir. I have no desire myself to push the boundaries of space and his ability to share the joys as well as the hardships of it was fascinating. This is real space. Not sci-fi or Diet Space and certainly not for the claustrophobic or weak of stomach. Off to stalk Kelly's IG account.
56,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47219750-joanna-martin,2,"The book is very interesting and Scott's stories are once in a lifetime but I couldn't help to notice how conceited he sounds talking about all the ""cool"" things he's done. I'm sure he's better in person but from this book, I'm not sure I would want to meet him. A little disappointed."
57,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27176662-ford,2,Learned more about space travel but found I didn't like Scott Kelly. I also realized we are wasting money on manned space travel. Forget putting men on Mars and send probes and more space telescopes.

59,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1976637-jeff,4,"If my Wisconsin math is correct, this is my sixth astronaut memoir /biography/ autobiography and I'd rank it in that collection behind only the Sally Ride and Mike Massimino books. Scott Kelly is the American astronaut selected to spend a year in space aboard the ISS and this is his story of that experience. Actually, the book jumps back and forth between long mission on the ISS and the backstory of how he got there. I found both to be interesting, however, I was much more intrigued by his experiences in space. I listened to Endurance in audio. Scott's narration was straight ahead and usually without emotion or much inflection, unlike the book self-narrated by astronaut Mike Massimino who is a natural storyteller and hilarious. Still, Scott was a competent storyteller and had a knack for explaining the technical aspects of his life, and did throw some humor in here and there. He named his book Endurance after Shackleton's ship which was destroyed in his ill-fated journey to the South Pole. He brought Shackleton's book to space in order to remind himself that no matter how hard life became in space was it wasn't as bad as what Shackleton's expedition went through. The times he spent in space including the travel to and from space, were fascinating and covered not only his year-long stint on the ISS, but is first six-month ISS mission as well has his space shuttle missions and trips on the Soyuz. He does a nice job documenting his unique experiences in a relatable way. Scott and his Russian counterpart (who also spent a year on the ISS) were pushed to the physical limits living in zero G for so long and pushed to the mental limits knowing that they were away from friends and loved ones (and the whole damn Earth!) for a year. Scott said several times his biggest fear was that something bad would happen to one of his family members while he was in space as there would be nothing he could do to help. Sure enough, his sister-in-law congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords of AZ was shot in the head during a public appearance in Tucson. All he could do was watch the TV coverage from space. Some of the most interesting parts of the book for me were his comparisons of the Russian and American space agencies. Surprisingly, they both had very different sets of rules and philosophies, not to mention the differences between the Soyuz and the now-retired Space Shuttles. Some of his terrestrial stories were less interesting, like the unraveling of his marriage and troubles with his daughters. One of the unique things about Scott's time in space was that his identical twin, Mark, was on earth and was Scott's experimental control for the tests about the long term effects of living in space on Scott's body. Their almost identical physiology and DNA could be compared. The book ends shortly after Scott returns to earth so the results of these experiments were not included in the book. I guess that's what Google is for. One of Scott's final comments was an echo of the messages I've heard from other astronauts: from space the Earth appears to be an oasis in an infinite backdrop of stars and other galaxies, all too far to reach, so we humans need to get our act together and treat it as the special place it is. There is no plan B. "
60,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3030161-ericka-seidemann,5,"Wow. Just, wow.  This memoir is a page-turner from start to finish, and I appreciated that it wasn't structured chronologically, but rather followed Kelly's storytelling with flashbacks and flashforwards to create a riveting narrative.  Endurance is not just about Kelly's time on the ISS, but also delves into the training that led up to his becoming an astronaut. All of Kelly's experiences, from his time as an EMT on an ambulance to his career in the military flying fighter jets, contributed to his skill of calm focus in the face of extremes necessary to command the ISS. He also gives credit to those who molded and guided him on his journey, including his mom, who became the first female police officer in their home town of West Orange, New Jersey.  As ""civilians,"" we're fortunate to have this intimate glimpse into day-to-day life in space, and how the astronaut-adventurers come together to handle adversities, from space walk repairs to those dreaded phone calls from earth that something may be wrong with their loved ones back home. Endurance provides food for thought about our relationships with other nations and how precious our home planet truly is.  I had to carry a book of tape flags with me while reading this because I had to mark so many eye-opening passages that I didn't want to forget. I tortured my family with expositions and factoids that began, ""Listen to this, I read in Scott Kelly's book . . . ""  Without a doubt, you want to read this.  Many thanks to BookishFirst and Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group for the copy in exchange for my honest review. "
61,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33718320-samantha-colwell,3,"I received a copy of this book from Penguin Random House for an honest review.Scott Kelly's Endurance is a study in human achievement and the ISS is really the star of the show. Don't get me wrong--Scott Kelly is an interesting, personable, funny narrator, and his memoir is cohesive and strong. But the international space station, the way it functions and its purpose, is the most fascinating part of the novel. Endurance takes us in alternating chapters between episodes on the ISS and Kelly's life on earth: growing up with his twin brother, stressing in school over mediocre grades, the typical ""I wasn't great in school, but now I'm an astronaut"" thing. In spite of the fact that this book is about Kelly and his life, I found myself scanning through these chapters and moving onto the space station fodder. I loved learning about how the station works--how Kelly and cohorts eat in space, commit routine tasks, sleep on rotation, the politics of how human bodies endure. The progression of what man can achieve in space is so important to catalogue, and Kelly's memoir will go far in helping us understand the physical and mental toll a year in space can take. "
62,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19389289-paige,4,"It was difficult to put this memoir by former astronaut Scott Kelly down. This is the story of a living hero who comes across as approachable and relatable while also inspiring awe. I had limited background knowledge of the International Space Station or spaceflight, yet I was able to enjoy this book. This contained a fair amount of details and technical descriptions, but I never felt overwhelmed. What made this such an appealing read was that we never lose sight throughout that this is the personal story of an extraordinary man. And as remarkable as his accomplishments are, Scott Kelly the person does not get swallowed up by them. They are part of his experiences and he shares more than sugar coated versions. It was also fascinating to learn details about things including what it is like to prepare to launch into space, to command a space shuttle, and to live in space for a year. This book made me appreciate the space program, earth, and the tenacity of the human spirit."
63,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51021142-katie,5,"I wish I could give this book even more stars! I have read several other books written by astronauts about their time in space and Endurance is, by far, my favorite. The number of details included in this story makes it a very interesting read. Scott adds in many unique insights about his life on the iss, what led him to becoming an astronaut, what he was thinking or experiencing during different times and describing what the technical procedures are for. I highly recommend this book if you are interested in learning details about training, what astronauts experience during launch/reentry and what it is like to live in space."

It's a real eye opener to read a true life experience of an Astronaut of our time. Scott Kelly has a lived a remarkable life. I found him to be surprisingly relatable. Contagious in spirit. Inspirational. Funny. A true soldier. Willing to risk his life for humanity. So grateful for all the Astronauts out there, and Russia for continuing to send people up to space. Definitely a must read!"

I think he has a lot to thank his ghostwriter for, as Kelly's voice comes through loud and clear. Fascinating life, amazing experiences. He strips away the ""glamour"" associated with astronauts, exposing instead the sheer hard work, professionalism, teamwork, pain and ingenuity required. A must read for anyone even slightly interested in what we are doing in space."

69,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2048986-carrie-kellenberger,5,"Captain Scott Kelly has been on four flights to space and he is the US record holder for consecutive number of days spent in space. I don't know of any other person who has lived a life similar to his except for his identical twin brother Mark Kelly, who is also a fighter pilot, captain, and astronaut. Both brothers are also New York Times best-selling authors. I started my 2018 reading journey on two books: Endurance: A Year in Space, A Lifetime of Discovery by Scott Kelly and A Column of Fire by Ken Follett. I have been reading Scott Kelly's book at night and Ken Follett's book during the day. I happened to finish this one first and my oh my - 6 STARS. My hero has kept his hero status - not that I ever doubted Scott Kelly for a second. I've watched him rise in his career for years and followed his last space adventure with abnormal curiosity and utter fascination. Endurance: A Year in Space, A Lifetime of Discovery is a captivating memoir of Scott's journey to space and back to Earth. It also recounts his years of work towards becoming a fighter pilot and his formative years. I loved his writing style and his simple accounts of life in Russia while he was preparing for his flights to space as well as his accounts of life aboard the International Space Station. Time and time again, I was amazed at his observations and his perspectives on leadership, courage under pressure, and the importance of teamwork. Even after reading his book, it is hard for me to wrap my brain around some of the challenges he endured during his year in space and how he kept his cool. From the challenges of taking off and landing to isolation from everything and everyone he knows on Earth to the effects of space on the human body, there are just so many things in this book that made me pause and think. I loved his descriptions of how many types of aircrafts he learned to fly and the endless take offs and landings he performed in order to make his journey to space. I loved the descriptions of his camaraderie with the Russian Cosmonauts in ISS and I marvel at how two countries that were once at war are now co-existing in the same space in SPACE.I loved his compassion, his passion for life, and his sense of humor. I loved that he was able to describe his moments of unease and pain and push through them towards to horizon. There was so much I loved about this book, it is hard to put it all into a review. I've color-coded the whole book for passages I want to refer back to, but in all likelihood, I'll be writing a second review again once I've had a change to reread it. The only thing that really left me feeling dissatisfied with this book is that Captain Kelly doesn't address his issues with being back on Earth. The prologue mentions his pain, swelling and rashes, but the end of the book doesn't mention if these space symptoms have subsided or not. I have often wondered if I'd feel pain in space, and he answers my question thoroughly, but I'd like to know more about how he has done now that he has been back on Earth. Did his symptoms subside? Did they get worse? I guess I'll have to wait for his next book to find out. Either way, this one unanswered question was minuscule in comparison to all the other questions he answered about his year in space. Bravo, Astronaut Scott Kelly!Endurance: A Year in Space, A Lifetime of Discovery is a true testament to the strength of human will and resilience and the endless glory of imagination. Kelly has led a remarkable life, he wrote an incredible book, and the underlying message of hope: to never give up, to always persist at what you want - these are all takeaway lessons that I will remind myself of daily. Thank you, Captain Kelly, for your constant messages of hope and for your bravery and dedication to humanity. Best Takeaway Quotes from my first read: “I've learned that an achievement that seems to have been accomplished by one person probably has hundreds, maybe even thousands, of people's minds and work behind it, and I've learned that it's a privilege to be the embodiment of that work.”― Scott Kelly, Endurance: A Year in Space, A Lifetime of Discovery“What is it worth to see two former bitter enemies transform weapons into transport for exploration and the pursuit of scientific knowledge? What is it worth to see former enemy nations turn their warriors into crewmates and lifelong friends? This is impossible to put a dollar figure on, but to me it’s one of the things that makes this project worth the expense, even worth risking our lives.”― Scott Kelly, Endurance: A Year in Space, A Lifetime of DiscoveryI was up here as the only American with two Russian guys for six weeks this summer...and if something had happened to me, I would have counted on them for my life. We have a great relationship, and I think the international aspect of this program has been one of its highlights.― Scott Kelly, Endurance: A Year in Space, A Lifetime of DiscoveryYet the story of how we kept the space station cool - a huge chunk of metal flying through space getting roasted by the unfiltered sun for forty-five minutes out of every ninety while its enormous solar arrays generate electricity - is a story of engineering triumph with important implications for future space flight.― Scott Kelly, Endurance: A Year in Space, A Lifetime of Discovery"

At first I was relatively uninterested in the biographical aspects of the story, but as the book moved on I became more interested in Kelly and his life. I also enjoyed the glimpses of life aboard the space station. It certainly is not an easy life. "
71,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6904868-molly-mcinturff,5,"A fascinating memoir about Scott Kelly’s childhood, career as a US Navy fighter pilot and NASA astronaut, and his year-long mission at the International Space Station. I truly enjoyed it!"
72,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2526638-claudia-turner,5,"Scott Kelly is one of those rare individuals you meet only a few times in your life who has both a wild passionate soul and keen, calculating sense. He’s like Spock and Kirk rolled into one unforgettable space explorer. The title is fitting because throughout the book he cites the original “Endurance” about Shackleton’s exploration to Antarctica a century ago. Today we have the ISS and astronauts working against government apathy no to mention our understanding of time and space in order to reach into unknown regions of the universe and find if and how we’ll get to Mars. It all starts with a little grit and a lot of determination and Kelly (and his twin brother astronaut Mark Kelly) embody these traits. I’ve read quite a few astronaut and space books the last few years and one thing I’ve noticed is how difficult it is for many astronauts to maintain healthy marriages and relationships in general. There’s a lot of moving and traveling and being MIA for significant life events thats can strain the strongest of relationships. A lot of them didn’t come from cookie cutter backgrounds either and had to surpass life barriers that would break many a man. While everyone has their own perspective on their lives and the people that shaped them, Kelly does his best to understand and relate to the people he left behind even if it seems to fall short at times, like with his ex wife. Yet Kelly had one year at the ISS so a lot of time to really deconstruct his past, his place on earth, and how he got to where he is, and I love this soul searching, introspective type of writing. I also love his sense of humor and appreciation for minute details like with the flowers and toilet upon the ISS. Any great man/woman knows that greatness can’t exist without a lot of time given to all that appears trivial and inconsequential. All the little moments and the mundane aspects of life must be cared for and nurtured before “greatness” can be achieved. I appreciate Kelly’s thoughtfulness, his compassion, and most of all his adventurous spirit. He’s a true modern day explorer, a candid philosopher of sorts, and he would have made Shackleton proud."

Kimberly is even hosting a buddy read of it in July for her #greatspaceread!Endurance is one of those space memoirs that is mostly about the human condition and not about the science. I suck at science, but I LOVED this book and could not stop listening. At its core, this book is about a man’s willingness to go to almost any length to be a human lab rat for NASA to better understand space and our place within it.Kelly and his twin brother allowed their DNA to be used for research to help us figure out how to get to Mars. Scott lived on the ISS for a year while his twin stayed in Earth. But before all of that, Scott was your average teenager who didn’t know what to do with his life or how to take school serious. Then he read a book that gave him a clear goal, and he didn’t stop until he achieved that goal: flying a space shuttle.This book is full of jaw dropping moments. Moments you wouldn’t believe except, well, they did happen to Scott! I highly recommend this book to everyone and think we all can learn so much from Scott’s story.If you are looking for more on Scott and this year in space mission, there is a Netflix docuseries called....wait for it... A YEAR IN SPACE. But don’t watch it and hope to pass Kimberly’s Endurance test. She’ll know you cheated and didn’t read it."
74,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1384639-sandra,5,"As someone who has attended so many shuttle launches (one of which was Mr. Kelly’s flight in 1999) and landings and dreams of what its like to be in space, I was stoked to find out I was being given Endurance by Scott Kelly to review. I find outer space fascinating I follow the flight paths of the International Space Station (ISS)(which oddly enough will be crossing over my home at 6:22 p.m. tonight, and I am planning on watching it travel along on its journey with my high power binoculars). This book adds to my fascination. Retired Astronaut Scott Kelly is the longest occupying American resident of the ISS with 340 straight days in 2015-2016. Endurance is his memoir of that record-breaking stay and the rest of his “Lifetime of Discovery.” Selected to a ""year-long mission"" starting with Expedition 43, he then commanded Expedition 44 and 45, Mr. Kelly had put into practice what it was like to live on the Space Station two years before with his 5 months stay on the ISS during Expedition 26. His life journey through hardships in his childhood, his service in the Navy as a Pilot, fighting Prostate Cancer and those months of Expedition 43 prepared him for what came next. Endurance is the closest I will ever get to space and I ate up every word Mr. Kelly wrote. His struggles from being away from his family, his relationships, his joys, his mental and physical health, working with various countries Astronauts delving in Biomedical Engineering, his vivid explanations of the day to day jobs he completed were like a sci-fi novel turned reality. Can you imagine what it would be like to look at the earth and see it in all its glory, it’s distinguishing attributes? You don’t have to, Mr. Kelly gives you his view and feelings on what it is like. He makes you feel as if you are there, working, playing and traveling through zero gravity. The knowledge that you don’t have control over anything that happens on earth to your family is something that Mr. Kelly finds out about when his sister-in-law Congresswoman Gabriella Giffords is shot in Arizona at a Safeway grocery store parking lot meeting with constituents. Mr. Kelly had a few months left of his stay. A few things of what Mr. Kelly says of that experience, while leading the nation in a moment of silence concerning the horrific assassination attempt and deaths of six people and 13 injured that day in Tucson struck me as something to really chew on and change, and also some huge foreshadowing, “Those of us who have had the privilege to look down on the Earth from space get the chance to take a larger perspective of the planet and the people who share it. I feel more strongly than ever that we must do better” He explains after the moment of silence ""on the space station, we followed our normal routine. But I knew that on Earth somethings would never be the same.” Mr. Kelly’s life experiences told throughout this book show everyone that someone can come from obscurity and land into whatever they dream of becoming and beyond those dreams. This book is worth reading especially if you have any inkling of journeying from your own life to someone else’s and obviously if you love space exploration. This book hits one of my top five memoirs. Read it, you won’t regret it. Thanks to Bookish First for sending me a copy of Endurance: A Year in Space, A lifetime of Discovery I thoroughly enjoyed it. This book was given to me in lieu of my honest opinion."
75,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12691311-debbie,5,"I liked this book a lot! It was very interesting and held my interest throughout. Scott Kelly is a very funny guy and I liked how put that into the book. I learned a lot about the space industry. Most of it, I didn’t know. I certainly didn’t realize that there are still astronauts and that we are using Russia’s facilities. I now a little secret about dill, as well. Ha!! I think it’s great that we are cooperating with Russia in order to learn more about space and the secrets it holds. So many different things that I learned about were very extraordinary. A really good book that I enjoyed very much. Thanks to Bookish for providing me with a free copy of the book (a hard copy) in order for me to review."
76,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4474787-mimi,4,"Not only is the title a nod to Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage and it is interwoven in Kelly's time on the space station, but the reason that Scott goes into NASA is Tom Wolfe's The Right Stuff. I loved that reading was so integral to this story and loved Kelly's voice, history, and observations. It could have been a dry tome and was pleasantly live. "
77,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12765668-linda,4,"Capt. Scott Kelly, USN, a US astronaut extraordinaire, tells the compelling story of his life’s journey from a modest and underachieving childhood, to reading a book that changed his life, to becoming a Navy test pilot, then being accepted, along with his twin brother Mark, into the space program, and eventually taking up residence on the International Space Station for a full year. What an amazing adventure story! Scott isn’t a professional writer, and he had someone (Margaret Lazarus Dean) co-write with him, but Endurance felt like Scott told it his way, showing his faults as well as his triumphs, and teaching his readers enough about space travel to feel like we were almost along for the ride with him. I liked it a lot, scientific jargon notwithstanding."
78,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1432957-alison,5,"I’ll never go to space, but this book is a great replacement. Kelly’s account of his career and year in space captivated me. His writing is sometimes conversational, sometimes polished and poetic. His reflections on life after a year at the International Space Station are worth returning to again and again. I have a new respect for what it takes—mentally, physically, emotionally—to be an astronaut. I’ll be recommending this one for a while. “I’ve learned that an achievement that seems to have been accomplished by one person probably has hundreds, maybe even thousands, of people’s minds and work behind it, and I’ve learned that it’s a privilege to be the embodiment of that work.”"
79,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28613204-sara,5,"Fascinating first-hand account of astronaut Scott Kelly’s year aboard the International Space Station (ISS) and the insights he gained about life, family, and the future. From being 18 and captivated by Tom Wolfe’s The Right Stuff, to setting lofty, personal academic and professional goals, Scott Kelly proves that you can do “hard things” when you set your mind to it. Great book!"
80,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6005592-elena,2,Wasn't a masterpiece. I had to skip a lot and got really bored toward the end. It could have worked better if someone else had written it.
81,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10074653-dana,5,"Excellent book! I loved learning about his training and education to become an astronaut, as well as his time on the ISS. He has a very relaxed, witty style of writing and I enjoyed the jokes thrown in. It also wasn't so technical that you couldn't understand what he was talking about on the ISS. Highly recommend!"
82,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67612372-megan,3,"Oh my god, astronauts are so much braver than I thought.You know–everyone knows–deep down, that astronauts are a little bit crazy. They voluntarily launch themselves away from Earth at the speed of sound on top of a rocket that might be a bomb if it’s not regulated or cooled properly or if a tiny bolt is out of place, so that they can go explore what happens to people in a place that is passively trying to kill them at all times. Scott Kelly and his Russian counterpart, Misha Kornienko, lived up there for a year. In an environment that was gravity-less, water-less, air-less…people-less. The maximum number of people who were on the International Space Station while the two of them were completing their year in space was nine. Nine people to substitute the entire human race.Kelly’s anecdotes about the life on the ISS are brutally real, but told in such a matter-of-fact way that you almost forget the dangers. He reminds you, of course, that something as simple as fixing the toilet is a project of vital importance and that if a single bolt or screw goes floating off into the depths of the station, it might be lost forever. But it’s also funny to think about someone having the fix the toilet that’s in space. Kelly doesn’t shy away from these bits of humor, and even finds ways to make the tales of life-and-death zero-g shenanigans lighthearted and interesting. But there’s an underlying intensity that feels sort of like what I imagine living in space might feel like: you have to laugh at the monstrous vacuum trying to kill you, otherwise it will be too overwhelming to continue.Interspersed with tales from the ISS are chapters of how Scott Kelly became an astronaut. It was a long journey for him, from terrible student to Navy test pilot to various NASA jobs–space shuttle pilot, astronaut liaison with the Russian space agency, and finally long-flight mission astronaut. It’s quite a wild ride with various colorful characters and it shows a great resilience in Kelly, a perseverance and a determination that are incredibly important qualities in an astronaut.This book was very accessible–all of the hard science was explained in terms simple enough that even the most English-major-y of nerds (me) could understand. There were some technical bits that were a bit dense, but it was well worth reading through them to understand just how difficult rocket science really is. Or…space station science, I suppose. Anyone who read and enjoyed Andy Weir’s The Martian will probably like this book for similar reasons–fascinating scientific and technological explanations interspersed with a quiet sense of humor and personal journey narrative that disperses the intensity of the situation, but doesn’t detract from it.I highly recommend this book for lovers of space, for anyone who grew up looking at the stars and wishing they could walk among them. Reading Endurance is a little bit like living vicariously through Scott Kelly–maybe you’re the not one going on spacewalks and floating over to the Russian module for Friday dinners, but the sense of wonder and kinship between humanity and the starts is closer and more real. It’s a fascinating look at life in space and what it takes to get there–determination, a good sense of humor, an unparalleled strength, bravery, and…well, endurance."
83,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33105402-tyson,5,"“There's a starman waiting in the skyHe'd like to come and meet usBut he thinks he'd blow our mindsThere's a starman waiting in the skyHe's told us not to blow itCause he knows it's all worthwhile”Scott Kelly defines hard work in his career path to becoming an astronaut. His book does every justice to explain how he reached a point in his life where he become one of the only human beings to have the privilege to spend an entire year in outer space. His writing is enough to make even a person with minimal interest in space exploration envious of his opportunity.This was Kelly’s first book, which is not surprising because he seems to have been rather busy in the years preceding it. He worked hard to overcome obstacles, both personal and professional. For the most part, he seems like a no-nonsense kind of guy, a man who understands that in order to reach goals, much of it is the perseverance to help yourself. It is a quality that holds high importance in space, where there is nobody to hold your hand and resolve issues for you. Kelly’s attitude is not only symbolic but a literal protocol in his journey through 340 days spent on the International Space Station.Anybody can write a book about what they do. Whether it is a politician or a professional ball player, autobiographies have the capability to let us into the minds and lives of people who live in ways most of us probably won’t ever experience. But Kelly’s book is different. It is harder to wrap your head around, a grossly more monumental production because of all it entails. He leaves the planet, lives primarily on his own, and is responsible for things that we, as gravity-stuck humans, only know nature for taking care of (like providing air to breathe or keeping our food on our plates). Things we don’t blink an eye at, he faced as trials and tribulations, inhibitions to simple tasks like eating, moving, sleeping, and basic life functions.Please take the time to read this book. Please find Kelly’s social media accounts (Instagram most importantly) and follow along. Kelly, who had to learn how to do so many things to further his career, his personal life, and his days in space, has seemed to naturally add another to his list when he wrote this autobiography. It is a wonderful addition to the adventurous genre of travel."
84,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27943513-brian-mccue,4,A brief biography of Scott Kelly's life and his recent year-long stay in the ISS. Intensely interesting if you've ever wondered how the International Space Station functions. Lots of insights about the actual science of space travel with an emphasis on the hardships and how they apply to traveling to Mars. This book will make you watch all your favorite sci/fi films and read all your sci/fi books in a new light. Space is scary. Real scary. 
85,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6014143-dena,3,I really liked Scott Kelly's memoir. I have no desire myself to push the boundaries of space and his ability to share the joys as well as the hardships of it was fascinating. This is real space. Not sci-fi or Diet Space and certainly not for the claustrophobic or weak of stomach. Off to stalk Kelly's IG account.
86,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47219750-joanna-martin,2,"The book is very interesting and Scott's stories are once in a lifetime but I couldn't help to notice how conceited he sounds talking about all the ""cool"" things he's done. I'm sure he's better in person but from this book, I'm not sure I would want to meet him. A little disappointed."

89,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1976637-jeff,4,"If my Wisconsin math is correct, this is my sixth astronaut memoir /biography/ autobiography and I'd rank it in that collection behind only the Sally Ride and Mike Massimino books. Scott Kelly is the American astronaut selected to spend a year in space aboard the ISS and this is his story of that experience. Actually, the book jumps back and forth between long mission on the ISS and the backstory of how he got there. I found both to be interesting, however, I was much more intrigued by his experiences in space. I listened to Endurance in audio. Scott's narration was straight ahead and usually without emotion or much inflection, unlike the book self-narrated by astronaut Mike Massimino who is a natural storyteller and hilarious. Still, Scott was a competent storyteller and had a knack for explaining the technical aspects of his life, and did throw some humor in here and there. He named his book Endurance after Shackleton's ship which was destroyed in his ill-fated journey to the South Pole. He brought Shackleton's book to space in order to remind himself that no matter how hard life became in space was it wasn't as bad as what Shackleton's expedition went through. The times he spent in space including the travel to and from space, were fascinating and covered not only his year-long stint on the ISS, but is first six-month ISS mission as well has his space shuttle missions and trips on the Soyuz. He does a nice job documenting his unique experiences in a relatable way. Scott and his Russian counterpart (who also spent a year on the ISS) were pushed to the physical limits living in zero G for so long and pushed to the mental limits knowing that they were away from friends and loved ones (and the whole damn Earth!) for a year. Scott said several times his biggest fear was that something bad would happen to one of his family members while he was in space as there would be nothing he could do to help. Sure enough, his sister-in-law congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords of AZ was shot in the head during a public appearance in Tucson. All he could do was watch the TV coverage from space. Some of the most interesting parts of the book for me were his comparisons of the Russian and American space agencies. Surprisingly, they both had very different sets of rules and philosophies, not to mention the differences between the Soyuz and the now-retired Space Shuttles. Some of his terrestrial stories were less interesting, like the unraveling of his marriage and troubles with his daughters. One of the unique things about Scott's time in space was that his identical twin, Mark, was on earth and was Scott's experimental control for the tests about the long term effects of living in space on Scott's body. Their almost identical physiology and DNA could be compared. The book ends shortly after Scott returns to earth so the results of these experiments were not included in the book. I guess that's what Google is for. One of Scott's final comments was an echo of the messages I've heard from other astronauts: from space the Earth appears to be an oasis in an infinite backdrop of stars and other galaxies, all too far to reach, so we humans need to get our act together and treat it as the special place it is. There is no plan B. "
90,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3030161-ericka-seidemann,5,"Wow. Just, wow.  This memoir is a page-turner from start to finish, and I appreciated that it wasn't structured chronologically, but rather followed Kelly's storytelling with flashbacks and flashforwards to create a riveting narrative.  Endurance is not just about Kelly's time on the ISS, but also delves into the training that led up to his becoming an astronaut. All of Kelly's experiences, from his time as an EMT on an ambulance to his career in the military flying fighter jets, contributed to his skill of calm focus in the face of extremes necessary to command the ISS. He also gives credit to those who molded and guided him on his journey, including his mom, who became the first female police officer in their home town of West Orange, New Jersey.  As ""civilians,"" we're fortunate to have this intimate glimpse into day-to-day life in space, and how the astronaut-adventurers come together to handle adversities, from space walk repairs to those dreaded phone calls from earth that something may be wrong with their loved ones back home. Endurance provides food for thought about our relationships with other nations and how precious our home planet truly is.  I had to carry a book of tape flags with me while reading this because I had to mark so many eye-opening passages that I didn't want to forget. I tortured my family with expositions and factoids that began, ""Listen to this, I read in Scott Kelly's book . . . ""  Without a doubt, you want to read this.  Many thanks to BookishFirst and Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group for the copy in exchange for my honest review. "
91,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33718320-samantha-colwell,3,"I received a copy of this book from Penguin Random House for an honest review.Scott Kelly's Endurance is a study in human achievement and the ISS is really the star of the show. Don't get me wrong--Scott Kelly is an interesting, personable, funny narrator, and his memoir is cohesive and strong. But the international space station, the way it functions and its purpose, is the most fascinating part of the novel. Endurance takes us in alternating chapters between episodes on the ISS and Kelly's life on earth: growing up with his twin brother, stressing in school over mediocre grades, the typical ""I wasn't great in school, but now I'm an astronaut"" thing. In spite of the fact that this book is about Kelly and his life, I found myself scanning through these chapters and moving onto the space station fodder. I loved learning about how the station works--how Kelly and cohorts eat in space, commit routine tasks, sleep on rotation, the politics of how human bodies endure. The progression of what man can achieve in space is so important to catalogue, and Kelly's memoir will go far in helping us understand the physical and mental toll a year in space can take. "
92,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19389289-paige,4,"It was difficult to put this memoir by former astronaut Scott Kelly down. This is the story of a living hero who comes across as approachable and relatable while also inspiring awe. I had limited background knowledge of the International Space Station or spaceflight, yet I was able to enjoy this book. This contained a fair amount of details and technical descriptions, but I never felt overwhelmed. What made this such an appealing read was that we never lose sight throughout that this is the personal story of an extraordinary man. And as remarkable as his accomplishments are, Scott Kelly the person does not get swallowed up by them. They are part of his experiences and he shares more than sugar coated versions. It was also fascinating to learn details about things including what it is like to prepare to launch into space, to command a space shuttle, and to live in space for a year. This book made me appreciate the space program, earth, and the tenacity of the human spirit."

I have read several other books written by astronauts about their time in space and Endurance is, by far, my favorite. The number of details included in this story makes it a very interesting read. Scott adds in many unique insights about his life on the iss, what led him to becoming an astronaut, what he was thinking or experiencing during different times and describing what the technical procedures are for. I highly recommend this book if you are interested in learning details about training, what astronauts experience during launch/reentry and what it is like to live in space."

I think he has a lot to thank his ghostwriter for, as Kelly's voice comes through loud and clear. Fascinating life, amazing experiences. He strips away the ""glamour"" associated with astronauts, exposing instead the sheer hard work, professionalism, teamwork, pain and ingenuity required. A must read for anyone even slightly interested in what we are doing in space."

99,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2048986-carrie-kellenberger,5,"Captain Scott Kelly has been on four flights to space and he is the US record holder for consecutive number of days spent in space. I don't know of any other person who has lived a life similar to his except for his identical twin brother Mark Kelly, who is also a fighter pilot, captain, and astronaut. Both brothers are also New York Times best-selling authors. I started my 2018 reading journey on two books: Endurance: A Year in Space, A Lifetime of Discovery by Scott Kelly and A Column of Fire by Ken Follett. I have been reading Scott Kelly's book at night and Ken Follett's book during the day. I happened to finish this one first and my oh my - 6 STARS. My hero has kept his hero status - not that I ever doubted Scott Kelly for a second. I've watched him rise in his career for years and followed his last space adventure with abnormal curiosity and utter fascination. Endurance: A Year in Space, A Lifetime of Discovery is a captivating memoir of Scott's journey to space and back to Earth. It also recounts his years of work towards becoming a fighter pilot and his formative years. I loved his writing style and his simple accounts of life in Russia while he was preparing for his flights to space as well as his accounts of life aboard the International Space Station. Time and time again, I was amazed at his observations and his perspectives on leadership, courage under pressure, and the importance of teamwork. Even after reading his book, it is hard for me to wrap my brain around some of the challenges he endured during his year in space and how he kept his cool. From the challenges of taking off and landing to isolation from everything and everyone he knows on Earth to the effects of space on the human body, there are just so many things in this book that made me pause and think. I loved his descriptions of how many types of aircrafts he learned to fly and the endless take offs and landings he performed in order to make his journey to space. I loved the descriptions of his camaraderie with the Russian Cosmonauts in ISS and I marvel at how two countries that were once at war are now co-existing in the same space in SPACE.I loved his compassion, his passion for life, and his sense of humor. I loved that he was able to describe his moments of unease and pain and push through them towards to horizon. There was so much I loved about this book, it is hard to put it all into a review. I've color-coded the whole book for passages I want to refer back to, but in all likelihood, I'll be writing a second review again once I've had a change to reread it. The only thing that really left me feeling dissatisfied with this book is that Captain Kelly doesn't address his issues with being back on Earth. The prologue mentions his pain, swelling and rashes, but the end of the book doesn't mention if these space symptoms have subsided or not. I have often wondered if I'd feel pain in space, and he answers my question thoroughly, but I'd like to know more about how he has done now that he has been back on Earth. Did his symptoms subside? Did they get worse? I guess I'll have to wait for his next book to find out. Either way, this one unanswered question was minuscule in comparison to all the other questions he answered about his year in space. Bravo, Astronaut Scott Kelly!Endurance: A Year in Space, A Lifetime of Discovery is a true testament to the strength of human will and resilience and the endless glory of imagination. Kelly has led a remarkable life, he wrote an incredible book, and the underlying message of hope: to never give up, to always persist at what you want - these are all takeaway lessons that I will remind myself of daily. Thank you, Captain Kelly, for your constant messages of hope and for your bravery and dedication to humanity. Best Takeaway Quotes from my first read: “I've learned that an achievement that seems to have been accomplished by one person probably has hundreds, maybe even thousands, of people's minds and work behind it, and I've learned that it's a privilege to be the embodiment of that work.”― Scott Kelly, Endurance: A Year in Space, A Lifetime of Discovery“What is it worth to see two former bitter enemies transform weapons into transport for exploration and the pursuit of scientific knowledge? What is it worth to see former enemy nations turn their warriors into crewmates and lifelong friends? This is impossible to put a dollar figure on, but to me it’s one of the things that makes this project worth the expense, even worth risking our lives.”― Scott Kelly, Endurance: A Year in Space, A Lifetime of DiscoveryI was up here as the only American with two Russian guys for six weeks this summer...and if something had happened to me, I would have counted on them for my life. We have a great relationship, and I think the international aspect of this program has been one of its highlights.― Scott Kelly, Endurance: A Year in Space, A Lifetime of DiscoveryYet the story of how we kept the space station cool - a huge chunk of metal flying through space getting roasted by the unfiltered sun for forty-five minutes out of every ninety while its enormous solar arrays generate electricity - is a story of engineering triumph with important implications for future space flight.― Scott Kelly, Endurance: A Year in Space, A Lifetime of Discovery"

The title is fitting because throughout the book he cites the original “Endurance” about Shackleton’s exploration to Antarctica a century ago. Today we have the ISS and astronauts working against government apathy no to mention our understanding of time and space in order to reach into unknown regions of the universe and find if and how we’ll get to Mars. It all starts with a little grit and a lot of determination and Kelly (and his twin brother astronaut Mark Kelly) embody these traits. I’ve read quite a few astronaut and space books the last few years and one thing I’ve noticed is how difficult it is for many astronauts to maintain healthy marriages and relationships in general. There’s a lot of moving and traveling and being MIA for significant life events thats can strain the strongest of relationships. A lot of them didn’t come from cookie cutter backgrounds either and had to surpass life barriers that would break many a man. While everyone has their own perspective on their lives and the people that shaped them, Kelly does his best to understand and relate to the people he left behind even if it seems to fall short at times, like with his ex wife. Yet Kelly had one year at the ISS so a lot of time to really deconstruct his past, his place on earth, and how he got to where he is, and I love this soul searching, introspective type of writing. I also love his sense of humor and appreciation for minute details like with the flowers and toilet upon the ISS. Any great man/woman knows that greatness can’t exist without a lot of time given to all that appears trivial and inconsequential. All the little moments and the mundane aspects of life must be cared for and nurtured before “greatness” can be achieved. I appreciate Kelly’s thoughtfulness, his compassion, and most of all his adventurous spirit. He’s a true modern day explorer, a candid philosopher of sorts, and he would have made Shackleton proud."

Kimberly is even hosting a buddy read of it in July for her #greatspaceread!Endurance is one of those space memoirs that is mostly about the human condition and not about the science. I suck at science, but I LOVED this book and could not stop listening. At its core, this book is about a man’s willingness to go to almost any length to be a human lab rat for NASA to better understand space and our place within it.Kelly and his twin brother allowed their DNA to be used for research to help us figure out how to get to Mars. Scott lived on the ISS for a year while his twin stayed in Earth. But before all of that, Scott was your average teenager who didn’t know what to do with his life or how to take school serious. Then he read a book that gave him a clear goal, and he didn’t stop until he achieved that goal: flying a space shuttle.This book is full of jaw dropping moments. Moments you wouldn’t believe except, well, they did happen to Scott! I highly recommend this book to everyone and think we all can learn so much from Scott’s story.If you are looking for more on Scott and this year in space mission, there is a Netflix docuseries called....wait for it... A YEAR IN SPACE. But don’t watch it and hope to pass Kimberly’s Endurance test. She’ll know you cheated and didn’t read it."
104,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1384639-sandra,5,"As someone who has attended so many shuttle launches (one of which was Mr. Kelly’s flight in 1999) and landings and dreams of what its like to be in space, I was stoked to find out I was being given Endurance by Scott Kelly to review. I find outer space fascinating I follow the flight paths of the International Space Station (ISS)(which oddly enough will be crossing over my home at 6:22 p.m. tonight, and I am planning on watching it travel along on its journey with my high power binoculars). This book adds to my fascination. Retired Astronaut Scott Kelly is the longest occupying American resident of the ISS with 340 straight days in 2015-2016. Endurance is his memoir of that record-breaking stay and the rest of his “Lifetime of Discovery.” Selected to a ""year-long mission"" starting with Expedition 43, he then commanded Expedition 44 and 45, Mr. Kelly had put into practice what it was like to live on the Space Station two years before with his 5 months stay on the ISS during Expedition 26. His life journey through hardships in his childhood, his service in the Navy as a Pilot, fighting Prostate Cancer and those months of Expedition 43 prepared him for what came next. Endurance is the closest I will ever get to space and I ate up every word Mr. Kelly wrote. His struggles from being away from his family, his relationships, his joys, his mental and physical health, working with various countries Astronauts delving in Biomedical Engineering, his vivid explanations of the day to day jobs he completed were like a sci-fi novel turned reality. Can you imagine what it would be like to look at the earth and see it in all its glory, it’s distinguishing attributes? You don’t have to, Mr. Kelly gives you his view and feelings on what it is like. He makes you feel as if you are there, working, playing and traveling through zero gravity. The knowledge that you don’t have control over anything that happens on earth to your family is something that Mr. Kelly finds out about when his sister-in-law Congresswoman Gabriella Giffords is shot in Arizona at a Safeway grocery store parking lot meeting with constituents. Mr. Kelly had a few months left of his stay. A few things of what Mr. Kelly says of that experience, while leading the nation in a moment of silence concerning the horrific assassination attempt and deaths of six people and 13 injured that day in Tucson struck me as something to really chew on and change, and also some huge foreshadowing, “Those of us who have had the privilege to look down on the Earth from space get the chance to take a larger perspective of the planet and the people who share it. I feel more strongly than ever that we must do better” He explains after the moment of silence ""on the space station, we followed our normal routine. But I knew that on Earth somethings would never be the same.” Mr. Kelly’s life experiences told throughout this book show everyone that someone can come from obscurity and land into whatever they dream of becoming and beyond those dreams. This book is worth reading especially if you have any inkling of journeying from your own life to someone else’s and obviously if you love space exploration. This book hits one of my top five memoirs. Read it, you won’t regret it. Thanks to Bookish First for sending me a copy of Endurance: A Year in Space, A lifetime of Discovery I thoroughly enjoyed it. This book was given to me in lieu of my honest opinion."
105,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12691311-debbie,5,"I liked this book a lot! It was very interesting and held my interest throughout. Scott Kelly is a very funny guy and I liked how put that into the book. I learned a lot about the space industry. Most of it, I didn’t know. I certainly didn’t realize that there are still astronauts and that we are using Russia’s facilities. I now a little secret about dill, as well. Ha!! I think it’s great that we are cooperating with Russia in order to learn more about space and the secrets it holds. So many different things that I learned about were very extraordinary. A really good book that I enjoyed very much. Thanks to Bookish for providing me with a free copy of the book (a hard copy) in order for me to review."
106,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4474787-mimi,4,"Not only is the title a nod to Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage and it is interwoven in Kelly's time on the space station, but the reason that Scott goes into NASA is Tom Wolfe's The Right Stuff. I loved that reading was so integral to this story and loved Kelly's voice, history, and observations. It could have been a dry tome and was pleasantly live. "
107,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12765668-linda,4,"Capt. Scott Kelly, USN, a US astronaut extraordinaire, tells the compelling story of his life’s journey from a modest and underachieving childhood, to reading a book that changed his life, to becoming a Navy test pilot, then being accepted, along with his twin brother Mark, into the space program, and eventually taking up residence on the International Space Station for a full year. What an amazing adventure story! Scott isn’t a professional writer, and he had someone (Margaret Lazarus Dean) co-write with him, but Endurance felt like Scott told it his way, showing his faults as well as his triumphs, and teaching his readers enough about space travel to feel like we were almost along for the ride with him. I liked it a lot, scientific jargon notwithstanding."
108,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1432957-alison,5,"I’ll never go to space, but this book is a great replacement. Kelly’s account of his career and year in space captivated me. His writing is sometimes conversational, sometimes polished and poetic. His reflections on life after a year at the International Space Station are worth returning to again and again. I have a new respect for what it takes—mentally, physically, emotionally—to be an astronaut. I’ll be recommending this one for a while. “I’ve learned that an achievement that seems to have been accomplished by one person probably has hundreds, maybe even thousands, of people’s minds and work behind it, and I’ve learned that it’s a privilege to be the embodiment of that work.”"
109,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28613204-sara,5,"Fascinating first-hand account of astronaut Scott Kelly’s year aboard the International Space Station (ISS) and the insights he gained about life, family, and the future. From being 18 and captivated by Tom Wolfe’s The Right Stuff, to setting lofty, personal academic and professional goals, Scott Kelly proves that you can do “hard things” when you set your mind to it. Great book!"
110,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6005592-elena,2,Wasn't a masterpiece. I had to skip a lot and got really bored toward the end. It could have worked better if someone else had written it.
111,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10074653-dana,5,"Excellent book! I loved learning about his training and education to become an astronaut, as well as his time on the ISS. He has a very relaxed, witty style of writing and I enjoyed the jokes thrown in. It also wasn't so technical that you couldn't understand what he was talking about on the ISS. Highly recommend!"
112,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67612372-megan,3,"Oh my god, astronauts are so much braver than I thought.You know–everyone knows–deep down, that astronauts are a little bit crazy. They voluntarily launch themselves away from Earth at the speed of sound on top of a rocket that might be a bomb if it’s not regulated or cooled properly or if a tiny bolt is out of place, so that they can go explore what happens to people in a place that is passively trying to kill them at all times. Scott Kelly and his Russian counterpart, Misha Kornienko, lived up there for a year. In an environment that was gravity-less, water-less, air-less…people-less. The maximum number of people who were on the International Space Station while the two of them were completing their year in space was nine. Nine people to substitute the entire human race.Kelly’s anecdotes about the life on the ISS are brutally real, but told in such a matter-of-fact way that you almost forget the dangers. He reminds you, of course, that something as simple as fixing the toilet is a project of vital importance and that if a single bolt or screw goes floating off into the depths of the station, it might be lost forever. But it’s also funny to think about someone having the fix the toilet that’s in space. Kelly doesn’t shy away from these bits of humor, and even finds ways to make the tales of life-and-death zero-g shenanigans lighthearted and interesting. But there’s an underlying intensity that feels sort of like what I imagine living in space might feel like: you have to laugh at the monstrous vacuum trying to kill you, otherwise it will be too overwhelming to continue.Interspersed with tales from the ISS are chapters of how Scott Kelly became an astronaut. It was a long journey for him, from terrible student to Navy test pilot to various NASA jobs–space shuttle pilot, astronaut liaison with the Russian space agency, and finally long-flight mission astronaut. It’s quite a wild ride with various colorful characters and it shows a great resilience in Kelly, a perseverance and a determination that are incredibly important qualities in an astronaut.This book was very accessible–all of the hard science was explained in terms simple enough that even the most English-major-y of nerds (me) could understand. There were some technical bits that were a bit dense, but it was well worth reading through them to understand just how difficult rocket science really is. Or…space station science, I suppose. Anyone who read and enjoyed Andy Weir’s The Martian will probably like this book for similar reasons–fascinating scientific and technological explanations interspersed with a quiet sense of humor and personal journey narrative that disperses the intensity of the situation, but doesn’t detract from it.I highly recommend this book for lovers of space, for anyone who grew up looking at the stars and wishing they could walk among them. Reading Endurance is a little bit like living vicariously through Scott Kelly–maybe you’re the not one going on spacewalks and floating over to the Russian module for Friday dinners, but the sense of wonder and kinship between humanity and the starts is closer and more real. It’s a fascinating look at life in space and what it takes to get there–determination, a good sense of humor, an unparalleled strength, bravery, and…well, endurance."
113,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33105402-tyson,5,"“There's a starman waiting in the skyHe'd like to come and meet usBut he thinks he'd blow our mindsThere's a starman waiting in the skyHe's told us not to blow itCause he knows it's all worthwhile”Scott Kelly defines hard work in his career path to becoming an astronaut. His book does every justice to explain how he reached a point in his life where he become one of the only human beings to have the privilege to spend an entire year in outer space. His writing is enough to make even a person with minimal interest in space exploration envious of his opportunity.This was Kelly’s first book, which is not surprising because he seems to have been rather busy in the years preceding it. He worked hard to overcome obstacles, both personal and professional. For the most part, he seems like a no-nonsense kind of guy, a man who understands that in order to reach goals, much of it is the perseverance to help yourself. It is a quality that holds high importance in space, where there is nobody to hold your hand and resolve issues for you. Kelly’s attitude is not only symbolic but a literal protocol in his journey through 340 days spent on the International Space Station.Anybody can write a book about what they do. Whether it is a politician or a professional ball player, autobiographies have the capability to let us into the minds and lives of people who live in ways most of us probably won’t ever experience. But Kelly’s book is different. It is harder to wrap your head around, a grossly more monumental production because of all it entails. He leaves the planet, lives primarily on his own, and is responsible for things that we, as gravity-stuck humans, only know nature for taking care of (like providing air to breathe or keeping our food on our plates). Things we don’t blink an eye at, he faced as trials and tribulations, inhibitions to simple tasks like eating, moving, sleeping, and basic life functions.Please take the time to read this book. Please find Kelly’s social media accounts (Instagram most importantly) and follow along. Kelly, who had to learn how to do so many things to further his career, his personal life, and his days in space, has seemed to naturally add another to his list when he wrote this autobiography. It is a wonderful addition to the adventurous genre of travel."
114,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27943513-brian-mccue,4,A brief biography of Scott Kelly's life and his recent year-long stay in the ISS. Intensely interesting if you've ever wondered how the International Space Station functions. Lots of insights about the actual science of space travel with an emphasis on the hardships and how they apply to traveling to Mars. This book will make you watch all your favorite sci/fi films and read all your sci/fi books in a new light. Space is scary. Real scary. 
115,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6014143-dena,3,I really liked Scott Kelly's memoir. I have no desire myself to push the boundaries of space and his ability to share the joys as well as the hardships of it was fascinating. This is real space. Not sci-fi or Diet Space and certainly not for the claustrophobic or weak of stomach. Off to stalk Kelly's IG account.
116,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47219750-joanna-martin,2,"The book is very interesting and Scott's stories are once in a lifetime but I couldn't help to notice how conceited he sounds talking about all the ""cool"" things he's done. I'm sure he's better in person but from this book, I'm not sure I would want to meet him. A little disappointed."
117,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27176662-ford,2,Learned more about space travel but found I didn't like Scott Kelly. I also realized we are wasting money on manned space travel. Forget putting men on Mars and send probes and more space telescopes.

119,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1976637-jeff,4,"If my Wisconsin math is correct, this is my sixth astronaut memoir /biography/ autobiography and I'd rank it in that collection behind only the Sally Ride and Mike Massimino books. Scott Kelly is the American astronaut selected to spend a year in space aboard the ISS and this is his story of that experience. Actually, the book jumps back and forth between long mission on the ISS and the backstory of how he got there. I found both to be interesting, however, I was much more intrigued by his experiences in space. I listened to Endurance in audio. Scott's narration was straight ahead and usually without emotion or much inflection, unlike the book self-narrated by astronaut Mike Massimino who is a natural storyteller and hilarious. Still, Scott was a competent storyteller and had a knack for explaining the technical aspects of his life, and did throw some humor in here and there. He named his book Endurance after Shackleton's ship which was destroyed in his ill-fated journey to the South Pole. He brought Shackleton's book to space in order to remind himself that no matter how hard life became in space was it wasn't as bad as what Shackleton's expedition went through. The times he spent in space including the travel to and from space, were fascinating and covered not only his year-long stint on the ISS, but is first six-month ISS mission as well has his space shuttle missions and trips on the Soyuz. He does a nice job documenting his unique experiences in a relatable way. Scott and his Russian counterpart (who also spent a year on the ISS) were pushed to the physical limits living in zero G for so long and pushed to the mental limits knowing that they were away from friends and loved ones (and the whole damn Earth!) for a year. Scott said several times his biggest fear was that something bad would happen to one of his family members while he was in space as there would be nothing he could do to help. Sure enough, his sister-in-law congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords of AZ was shot in the head during a public appearance in Tucson. All he could do was watch the TV coverage from space. Some of the most interesting parts of the book for me were his comparisons of the Russian and American space agencies. Surprisingly, they both had very different sets of rules and philosophies, not to mention the differences between the Soyuz and the now-retired Space Shuttles. Some of his terrestrial stories were less interesting, like the unraveling of his marriage and troubles with his daughters. One of the unique things about Scott's time in space was that his identical twin, Mark, was on earth and was Scott's experimental control for the tests about the long term effects of living in space on Scott's body. Their almost identical physiology and DNA could be compared. The book ends shortly after Scott returns to earth so the results of these experiments were not included in the book. I guess that's what Google is for. One of Scott's final comments was an echo of the messages I've heard from other astronauts: from space the Earth appears to be an oasis in an infinite backdrop of stars and other galaxies, all too far to reach, so we humans need to get our act together and treat it as the special place it is. There is no plan B. "
120,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3030161-ericka-seidemann,5,"Wow. Just, wow.  This memoir is a page-turner from start to finish, and I appreciated that it wasn't structured chronologically, but rather followed Kelly's storytelling with flashbacks and flashforwards to create a riveting narrative.  Endurance is not just about Kelly's time on the ISS, but also delves into the training that led up to his becoming an astronaut. All of Kelly's experiences, from his time as an EMT on an ambulance to his career in the military flying fighter jets, contributed to his skill of calm focus in the face of extremes necessary to command the ISS. He also gives credit to those who molded and guided him on his journey, including his mom, who became the first female police officer in their home town of West Orange, New Jersey.  As ""civilians,"" we're fortunate to have this intimate glimpse into day-to-day life in space, and how the astronaut-adventurers come together to handle adversities, from space walk repairs to those dreaded phone calls from earth that something may be wrong with their loved ones back home. Endurance provides food for thought about our relationships with other nations and how precious our home planet truly is.  I had to carry a book of tape flags with me while reading this because I had to mark so many eye-opening passages that I didn't want to forget. I tortured my family with expositions and factoids that began, ""Listen to this, I read in Scott Kelly's book . . . ""  Without a doubt, you want to read this.  Many thanks to BookishFirst and Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group for the copy in exchange for my honest review. "
121,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33718320-samantha-colwell,3,"I received a copy of this book from Penguin Random House for an honest review.Scott Kelly's Endurance is a study in human achievement and the ISS is really the star of the show. Don't get me wrong--Scott Kelly is an interesting, personable, funny narrator, and his memoir is cohesive and strong. But the international space station, the way it functions and its purpose, is the most fascinating part of the novel. Endurance takes us in alternating chapters between episodes on the ISS and Kelly's life on earth: growing up with his twin brother, stressing in school over mediocre grades, the typical ""I wasn't great in school, but now I'm an astronaut"" thing. In spite of the fact that this book is about Kelly and his life, I found myself scanning through these chapters and moving onto the space station fodder. I loved learning about how the station works--how Kelly and cohorts eat in space, commit routine tasks, sleep on rotation, the politics of how human bodies endure. The progression of what man can achieve in space is so important to catalogue, and Kelly's memoir will go far in helping us understand the physical and mental toll a year in space can take. "
122,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19389289-paige,4,"It was difficult to put this memoir by former astronaut Scott Kelly down. This is the story of a living hero who comes across as approachable and relatable while also inspiring awe. I had limited background knowledge of the International Space Station or spaceflight, yet I was able to enjoy this book. This contained a fair amount of details and technical descriptions, but I never felt overwhelmed. What made this such an appealing read was that we never lose sight throughout that this is the personal story of an extraordinary man. And as remarkable as his accomplishments are, Scott Kelly the person does not get swallowed up by them. They are part of his experiences and he shares more than sugar coated versions. It was also fascinating to learn details about things including what it is like to prepare to launch into space, to command a space shuttle, and to live in space for a year. This book made me appreciate the space program, earth, and the tenacity of the human spirit."
123,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51021142-katie,5,"I wish I could give this book even more stars! I have read several other books written by astronauts about their time in space and Endurance is, by far, my favorite. The number of details included in this story makes it a very interesting read. Scott adds in many unique insights about his life on the iss, what led him to becoming an astronaut, what he was thinking or experiencing during different times and describing what the technical procedures are for. I highly recommend this book if you are interested in learning details about training, what astronauts experience during launch/reentry and what it is like to live in space."

It's a real eye opener to read a true life experience of an Astronaut of our time. Scott Kelly has a lived a remarkable life. I found him to be surprisingly relatable. Contagious in spirit. Inspirational. Funny. A true soldier. Willing to risk his life for humanity. So grateful for all the Astronauts out there, and Russia for continuing to send people up to space. Definitely a must read!"

I think he has a lot to thank his ghostwriter for, as Kelly's voice comes through loud and clear. Fascinating life, amazing experiences. He strips away the ""glamour"" associated with astronauts, exposing instead the sheer hard work, professionalism, teamwork, pain and ingenuity required. A must read for anyone even slightly interested in what we are doing in space."

129,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2048986-carrie-kellenberger,5,"Captain Scott Kelly has been on four flights to space and he is the US record holder for consecutive number of days spent in space. I don't know of any other person who has lived a life similar to his except for his identical twin brother Mark Kelly, who is also a fighter pilot, captain, and astronaut. Both brothers are also New York Times best-selling authors. I started my 2018 reading journey on two books: Endurance: A Year in Space, A Lifetime of Discovery by Scott Kelly and A Column of Fire by Ken Follett. I have been reading Scott Kelly's book at night and Ken Follett's book during the day. I happened to finish this one first and my oh my - 6 STARS. My hero has kept his hero status - not that I ever doubted Scott Kelly for a second. I've watched him rise in his career for years and followed his last space adventure with abnormal curiosity and utter fascination. Endurance: A Year in Space, A Lifetime of Discovery is a captivating memoir of Scott's journey to space and back to Earth. It also recounts his years of work towards becoming a fighter pilot and his formative years. I loved his writing style and his simple accounts of life in Russia while he was preparing for his flights to space as well as his accounts of life aboard the International Space Station. Time and time again, I was amazed at his observations and his perspectives on leadership, courage under pressure, and the importance of teamwork. Even after reading his book, it is hard for me to wrap my brain around some of the challenges he endured during his year in space and how he kept his cool. From the challenges of taking off and landing to isolation from everything and everyone he knows on Earth to the effects of space on the human body, there are just so many things in this book that made me pause and think. I loved his descriptions of how many types of aircrafts he learned to fly and the endless take offs and landings he performed in order to make his journey to space. I loved the descriptions of his camaraderie with the Russian Cosmonauts in ISS and I marvel at how two countries that were once at war are now co-existing in the same space in SPACE.I loved his compassion, his passion for life, and his sense of humor. I loved that he was able to describe his moments of unease and pain and push through them towards to horizon. There was so much I loved about this book, it is hard to put it all into a review. I've color-coded the whole book for passages I want to refer back to, but in all likelihood, I'll be writing a second review again once I've had a change to reread it. The only thing that really left me feeling dissatisfied with this book is that Captain Kelly doesn't address his issues with being back on Earth. The prologue mentions his pain, swelling and rashes, but the end of the book doesn't mention if these space symptoms have subsided or not. I have often wondered if I'd feel pain in space, and he answers my question thoroughly, but I'd like to know more about how he has done now that he has been back on Earth. Did his symptoms subside? Did they get worse? I guess I'll have to wait for his next book to find out. Either way, this one unanswered question was minuscule in comparison to all the other questions he answered about his year in space. Bravo, Astronaut Scott Kelly!Endurance: A Year in Space, A Lifetime of Discovery is a true testament to the strength of human will and resilience and the endless glory of imagination. Kelly has led a remarkable life, he wrote an incredible book, and the underlying message of hope: to never give up, to always persist at what you want - these are all takeaway lessons that I will remind myself of daily. Thank you, Captain Kelly, for your constant messages of hope and for your bravery and dedication to humanity. Best Takeaway Quotes from my first read: “I've learned that an achievement that seems to have been accomplished by one person probably has hundreds, maybe even thousands, of people's minds and work behind it, and I've learned that it's a privilege to be the embodiment of that work.”― Scott Kelly, Endurance: A Year in Space, A Lifetime of Discovery“What is it worth to see two former bitter enemies transform weapons into transport for exploration and the pursuit of scientific knowledge? What is it worth to see former enemy nations turn their warriors into crewmates and lifelong friends? This is impossible to put a dollar figure on, but to me it’s one of the things that makes this project worth the expense, even worth risking our lives.”― Scott Kelly, Endurance: A Year in Space, A Lifetime of DiscoveryI was up here as the only American with two Russian guys for six weeks this summer...and if something had happened to me, I would have counted on them for my life. We have a great relationship, and I think the international aspect of this program has been one of its highlights.― Scott Kelly, Endurance: A Year in Space, A Lifetime of DiscoveryYet the story of how we kept the space station cool - a huge chunk of metal flying through space getting roasted by the unfiltered sun for forty-five minutes out of every ninety while its enormous solar arrays generate electricity - is a story of engineering triumph with important implications for future space flight.― Scott Kelly, Endurance: A Year in Space, A Lifetime of Discovery"

At first I was relatively uninterested in the biographical aspects of the story, but as the book moved on I became more interested in Kelly and his life. I also enjoyed the glimpses of life aboard the space station. It certainly is not an easy life. "
131,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6904868-molly-mcinturff,5,"A fascinating memoir about Scott Kelly’s childhood, career as a US Navy fighter pilot and NASA astronaut, and his year-long mission at the International Space Station. I truly enjoyed it!"
132,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2526638-claudia-turner,5,"Scott Kelly is one of those rare individuals you meet only a few times in your life who has both a wild passionate soul and keen, calculating sense. He’s like Spock and Kirk rolled into one unforgettable space explorer. The title is fitting because throughout the book he cites the original “Endurance” about Shackleton’s exploration to Antarctica a century ago. Today we have the ISS and astronauts working against government apathy no to mention our understanding of time and space in order to reach into unknown regions of the universe and find if and how we’ll get to Mars. It all starts with a little grit and a lot of determination and Kelly (and his twin brother astronaut Mark Kelly) embody these traits. I’ve read quite a few astronaut and space books the last few years and one thing I’ve noticed is how difficult it is for many astronauts to maintain healthy marriages and relationships in general. There’s a lot of moving and traveling and being MIA for significant life events thats can strain the strongest of relationships. A lot of them didn’t come from cookie cutter backgrounds either and had to surpass life barriers that would break many a man. While everyone has their own perspective on their lives and the people that shaped them, Kelly does his best to understand and relate to the people he left behind even if it seems to fall short at times, like with his ex wife. Yet Kelly had one year at the ISS so a lot of time to really deconstruct his past, his place on earth, and how he got to where he is, and I love this soul searching, introspective type of writing. I also love his sense of humor and appreciation for minute details like with the flowers and toilet upon the ISS. Any great man/woman knows that greatness can’t exist without a lot of time given to all that appears trivial and inconsequential. All the little moments and the mundane aspects of life must be cared for and nurtured before “greatness” can be achieved. I appreciate Kelly’s thoughtfulness, his compassion, and most of all his adventurous spirit. He’s a true modern day explorer, a candid philosopher of sorts, and he would have made Shackleton proud."

Kimberly is even hosting a buddy read of it in July for her #greatspaceread!Endurance is one of those space memoirs that is mostly about the human condition and not about the science. I suck at science, but I LOVED this book and could not stop listening. At its core, this book is about a man’s willingness to go to almost any length to be a human lab rat for NASA to better understand space and our place within it.Kelly and his twin brother allowed their DNA to be used for research to help us figure out how to get to Mars. Scott lived on the ISS for a year while his twin stayed in Earth. But before all of that, Scott was your average teenager who didn’t know what to do with his life or how to take school serious. Then he read a book that gave him a clear goal, and he didn’t stop until he achieved that goal: flying a space shuttle.This book is full of jaw dropping moments. Moments you wouldn’t believe except, well, they did happen to Scott! I highly recommend this book to everyone and think we all can learn so much from Scott’s story.If you are looking for more on Scott and this year in space mission, there is a Netflix docuseries called....wait for it... A YEAR IN SPACE. But don’t watch it and hope to pass Kimberly’s Endurance test. She’ll know you cheated and didn’t read it."
134,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1384639-sandra,5,"As someone who has attended so many shuttle launches (one of which was Mr. Kelly’s flight in 1999) and landings and dreams of what its like to be in space, I was stoked to find out I was being given Endurance by Scott Kelly to review. I find outer space fascinating I follow the flight paths of the International Space Station (ISS)(which oddly enough will be crossing over my home at 6:22 p.m. tonight, and I am planning on watching it travel along on its journey with my high power binoculars). This book adds to my fascination. Retired Astronaut Scott Kelly is the longest occupying American resident of the ISS with 340 straight days in 2015-2016. Endurance is his memoir of that record-breaking stay and the rest of his “Lifetime of Discovery.” Selected to a ""year-long mission"" starting with Expedition 43, he then commanded Expedition 44 and 45, Mr. Kelly had put into practice what it was like to live on the Space Station two years before with his 5 months stay on the ISS during Expedition 26. His life journey through hardships in his childhood, his service in the Navy as a Pilot, fighting Prostate Cancer and those months of Expedition 43 prepared him for what came next. Endurance is the closest I will ever get to space and I ate up every word Mr. Kelly wrote. His struggles from being away from his family, his relationships, his joys, his mental and physical health, working with various countries Astronauts delving in Biomedical Engineering, his vivid explanations of the day to day jobs he completed were like a sci-fi novel turned reality. Can you imagine what it would be like to look at the earth and see it in all its glory, it’s distinguishing attributes? You don’t have to, Mr. Kelly gives you his view and feelings on what it is like. He makes you feel as if you are there, working, playing and traveling through zero gravity. The knowledge that you don’t have control over anything that happens on earth to your family is something that Mr. Kelly finds out about when his sister-in-law Congresswoman Gabriella Giffords is shot in Arizona at a Safeway grocery store parking lot meeting with constituents. Mr. Kelly had a few months left of his stay. A few things of what Mr. Kelly says of that experience, while leading the nation in a moment of silence concerning the horrific assassination attempt and deaths of six people and 13 injured that day in Tucson struck me as something to really chew on and change, and also some huge foreshadowing, “Those of us who have had the privilege to look down on the Earth from space get the chance to take a larger perspective of the planet and the people who share it. I feel more strongly than ever that we must do better” He explains after the moment of silence ""on the space station, we followed our normal routine. But I knew that on Earth somethings would never be the same.” Mr. Kelly’s life experiences told throughout this book show everyone that someone can come from obscurity and land into whatever they dream of becoming and beyond those dreams. This book is worth reading especially if you have any inkling of journeying from your own life to someone else’s and obviously if you love space exploration. This book hits one of my top five memoirs. Read it, you won’t regret it. Thanks to Bookish First for sending me a copy of Endurance: A Year in Space, A lifetime of Discovery I thoroughly enjoyed it. This book was given to me in lieu of my honest opinion."
135,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12691311-debbie,5,"I liked this book a lot! It was very interesting and held my interest throughout. Scott Kelly is a very funny guy and I liked how put that into the book. I learned a lot about the space industry. Most of it, I didn’t know. I certainly didn’t realize that there are still astronauts and that we are using Russia’s facilities. I now a little secret about dill, as well. Ha!! I think it’s great that we are cooperating with Russia in order to learn more about space and the secrets it holds. So many different things that I learned about were very extraordinary. A really good book that I enjoyed very much. Thanks to Bookish for providing me with a free copy of the book (a hard copy) in order for me to review."
136,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4474787-mimi,4,"Not only is the title a nod to Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage and it is interwoven in Kelly's time on the space station, but the reason that Scott goes into NASA is Tom Wolfe's The Right Stuff. I loved that reading was so integral to this story and loved Kelly's voice, history, and observations. It could have been a dry tome and was pleasantly live. "
137,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12765668-linda,4,"Capt. Scott Kelly, USN, a US astronaut extraordinaire, tells the compelling story of his life’s journey from a modest and underachieving childhood, to reading a book that changed his life, to becoming a Navy test pilot, then being accepted, along with his twin brother Mark, into the space program, and eventually taking up residence on the International Space Station for a full year. What an amazing adventure story! Scott isn’t a professional writer, and he had someone (Margaret Lazarus Dean) co-write with him, but Endurance felt like Scott told it his way, showing his faults as well as his triumphs, and teaching his readers enough about space travel to feel like we were almost along for the ride with him. I liked it a lot, scientific jargon notwithstanding."
138,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1432957-alison,5,"I’ll never go to space, but this book is a great replacement. Kelly’s account of his career and year in space captivated me. His writing is sometimes conversational, sometimes polished and poetic. His reflections on life after a year at the International Space Station are worth returning to again and again. I have a new respect for what it takes—mentally, physically, emotionally—to be an astronaut. I’ll be recommending this one for a while. “I’ve learned that an achievement that seems to have been accomplished by one person probably has hundreds, maybe even thousands, of people’s minds and work behind it, and I’ve learned that it’s a privilege to be the embodiment of that work.”"
139,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28613204-sara,5,"Fascinating first-hand account of astronaut Scott Kelly’s year aboard the International Space Station (ISS) and the insights he gained about life, family, and the future. From being 18 and captivated by Tom Wolfe’s The Right Stuff, to setting lofty, personal academic and professional goals, Scott Kelly proves that you can do “hard things” when you set your mind to it. Great book!"
140,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6005592-elena,2,Wasn't a masterpiece. I had to skip a lot and got really bored toward the end. It could have worked better if someone else had written it.
141,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10074653-dana,5,"Excellent book! I loved learning about his training and education to become an astronaut, as well as his time on the ISS. He has a very relaxed, witty style of writing and I enjoyed the jokes thrown in. It also wasn't so technical that you couldn't understand what he was talking about on the ISS. Highly recommend!"
142,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67612372-megan,3,"Oh my god, astronauts are so much braver than I thought.You know–everyone knows–deep down, that astronauts are a little bit crazy. They voluntarily launch themselves away from Earth at the speed of sound on top of a rocket that might be a bomb if it’s not regulated or cooled properly or if a tiny bolt is out of place, so that they can go explore what happens to people in a place that is passively trying to kill them at all times. Scott Kelly and his Russian counterpart, Misha Kornienko, lived up there for a year. In an environment that was gravity-less, water-less, air-less…people-less. The maximum number of people who were on the International Space Station while the two of them were completing their year in space was nine. Nine people to substitute the entire human race.Kelly’s anecdotes about the life on the ISS are brutally real, but told in such a matter-of-fact way that you almost forget the dangers. He reminds you, of course, that something as simple as fixing the toilet is a project of vital importance and that if a single bolt or screw goes floating off into the depths of the station, it might be lost forever. But it’s also funny to think about someone having the fix the toilet that’s in space. Kelly doesn’t shy away from these bits of humor, and even finds ways to make the tales of life-and-death zero-g shenanigans lighthearted and interesting. But there’s an underlying intensity that feels sort of like what I imagine living in space might feel like: you have to laugh at the monstrous vacuum trying to kill you, otherwise it will be too overwhelming to continue.Interspersed with tales from the ISS are chapters of how Scott Kelly became an astronaut. It was a long journey for him, from terrible student to Navy test pilot to various NASA jobs–space shuttle pilot, astronaut liaison with the Russian space agency, and finally long-flight mission astronaut. It’s quite a wild ride with various colorful characters and it shows a great resilience in Kelly, a perseverance and a determination that are incredibly important qualities in an astronaut.This book was very accessible–all of the hard science was explained in terms simple enough that even the most English-major-y of nerds (me) could understand. There were some technical bits that were a bit dense, but it was well worth reading through them to understand just how difficult rocket science really is. Or…space station science, I suppose. Anyone who read and enjoyed Andy Weir’s The Martian will probably like this book for similar reasons–fascinating scientific and technological explanations interspersed with a quiet sense of humor and personal journey narrative that disperses the intensity of the situation, but doesn’t detract from it.I highly recommend this book for lovers of space, for anyone who grew up looking at the stars and wishing they could walk among them. Reading Endurance is a little bit like living vicariously through Scott Kelly–maybe you’re the not one going on spacewalks and floating over to the Russian module for Friday dinners, but the sense of wonder and kinship between humanity and the starts is closer and more real. It’s a fascinating look at life in space and what it takes to get there–determination, a good sense of humor, an unparalleled strength, bravery, and…well, endurance."
143,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33105402-tyson,5,"“There's a starman waiting in the skyHe'd like to come and meet usBut he thinks he'd blow our mindsThere's a starman waiting in the skyHe's told us not to blow itCause he knows it's all worthwhile”Scott Kelly defines hard work in his career path to becoming an astronaut. His book does every justice to explain how he reached a point in his life where he become one of the only human beings to have the privilege to spend an entire year in outer space. His writing is enough to make even a person with minimal interest in space exploration envious of his opportunity.This was Kelly’s first book, which is not surprising because he seems to have been rather busy in the years preceding it. He worked hard to overcome obstacles, both personal and professional. For the most part, he seems like a no-nonsense kind of guy, a man who understands that in order to reach goals, much of it is the perseverance to help yourself. It is a quality that holds high importance in space, where there is nobody to hold your hand and resolve issues for you. Kelly’s attitude is not only symbolic but a literal protocol in his journey through 340 days spent on the International Space Station.Anybody can write a book about what they do. Whether it is a politician or a professional ball player, autobiographies have the capability to let us into the minds and lives of people who live in ways most of us probably won’t ever experience. But Kelly’s book is different. It is harder to wrap your head around, a grossly more monumental production because of all it entails. He leaves the planet, lives primarily on his own, and is responsible for things that we, as gravity-stuck humans, only know nature for taking care of (like providing air to breathe or keeping our food on our plates). Things we don’t blink an eye at, he faced as trials and tribulations, inhibitions to simple tasks like eating, moving, sleeping, and basic life functions.Please take the time to read this book. Please find Kelly’s social media accounts (Instagram most importantly) and follow along. Kelly, who had to learn how to do so many things to further his career, his personal life, and his days in space, has seemed to naturally add another to his list when he wrote this autobiography. It is a wonderful addition to the adventurous genre of travel."
144,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27943513-brian-mccue,4,A brief biography of Scott Kelly's life and his recent year-long stay in the ISS. Intensely interesting if you've ever wondered how the International Space Station functions. Lots of insights about the actual science of space travel with an emphasis on the hardships and how they apply to traveling to Mars. This book will make you watch all your favorite sci/fi films and read all your sci/fi books in a new light. Space is scary. Real scary. 
145,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6014143-dena,3,I really liked Scott Kelly's memoir. I have no desire myself to push the boundaries of space and his ability to share the joys as well as the hardships of it was fascinating. This is real space. Not sci-fi or Diet Space and certainly not for the claustrophobic or weak of stomach. Off to stalk Kelly's IG account.
146,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47219750-joanna-martin,2,"The book is very interesting and Scott's stories are once in a lifetime but I couldn't help to notice how conceited he sounds talking about all the ""cool"" things he's done. I'm sure he's better in person but from this book, I'm not sure I would want to meet him. A little disappointed."

149,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1976637-jeff,4,"If my Wisconsin math is correct, this is my sixth astronaut memoir /biography/ autobiography and I'd rank it in that collection behind only the Sally Ride and Mike Massimino books. Scott Kelly is the American astronaut selected to spend a year in space aboard the ISS and this is his story of that experience. Actually, the book jumps back and forth between long mission on the ISS and the backstory of how he got there. I found both to be interesting, however, I was much more intrigued by his experiences in space. I listened to Endurance in audio. Scott's narration was straight ahead and usually without emotion or much inflection, unlike the book self-narrated by astronaut Mike Massimino who is a natural storyteller and hilarious. Still, Scott was a competent storyteller and had a knack for explaining the technical aspects of his life, and did throw some humor in here and there. He named his book Endurance after Shackleton's ship which was destroyed in his ill-fated journey to the South Pole. He brought Shackleton's book to space in order to remind himself that no matter how hard life became in space was it wasn't as bad as what Shackleton's expedition went through. The times he spent in space including the travel to and from space, were fascinating and covered not only his year-long stint on the ISS, but is first six-month ISS mission as well has his space shuttle missions and trips on the Soyuz. He does a nice job documenting his unique experiences in a relatable way. Scott and his Russian counterpart (who also spent a year on the ISS) were pushed to the physical limits living in zero G for so long and pushed to the mental limits knowing that they were away from friends and loved ones (and the whole damn Earth!) for a year. Scott said several times his biggest fear was that something bad would happen to one of his family members while he was in space as there would be nothing he could do to help. Sure enough, his sister-in-law congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords of AZ was shot in the head during a public appearance in Tucson. All he could do was watch the TV coverage from space. Some of the most interesting parts of the book for me were his comparisons of the Russian and American space agencies. Surprisingly, they both had very different sets of rules and philosophies, not to mention the differences between the Soyuz and the now-retired Space Shuttles. Some of his terrestrial stories were less interesting, like the unraveling of his marriage and troubles with his daughters. One of the unique things about Scott's time in space was that his identical twin, Mark, was on earth and was Scott's experimental control for the tests about the long term effects of living in space on Scott's body. Their almost identical physiology and DNA could be compared. The book ends shortly after Scott returns to earth so the results of these experiments were not included in the book. I guess that's what Google is for. One of Scott's final comments was an echo of the messages I've heard from other astronauts: from space the Earth appears to be an oasis in an infinite backdrop of stars and other galaxies, all too far to reach, so we humans need to get our act together and treat it as the special place it is. There is no plan B. "
150,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3030161-ericka-seidemann,5,"Wow. Just, wow.  This memoir is a page-turner from start to finish, and I appreciated that it wasn't structured chronologically, but rather followed Kelly's storytelling with flashbacks and flashforwards to create a riveting narrative.  Endurance is not just about Kelly's time on the ISS, but also delves into the training that led up to his becoming an astronaut. All of Kelly's experiences, from his time as an EMT on an ambulance to his career in the military flying fighter jets, contributed to his skill of calm focus in the face of extremes necessary to command the ISS. He also gives credit to those who molded and guided him on his journey, including his mom, who became the first female police officer in their home town of West Orange, New Jersey.  As ""civilians,"" we're fortunate to have this intimate glimpse into day-to-day life in space, and how the astronaut-adventurers come together to handle adversities, from space walk repairs to those dreaded phone calls from earth that something may be wrong with their loved ones back home. Endurance provides food for thought about our relationships with other nations and how precious our home planet truly is.  I had to carry a book of tape flags with me while reading this because I had to mark so many eye-opening passages that I didn't want to forget. I tortured my family with expositions and factoids that began, ""Listen to this, I read in Scott Kelly's book . . . ""  Without a doubt, you want to read this.  Many thanks to BookishFirst and Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group for the copy in exchange for my honest review. "
151,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33718320-samantha-colwell,3,"I received a copy of this book from Penguin Random House for an honest review.Scott Kelly's Endurance is a study in human achievement and the ISS is really the star of the show. Don't get me wrong--Scott Kelly is an interesting, personable, funny narrator, and his memoir is cohesive and strong. But the international space station, the way it functions and its purpose, is the most fascinating part of the novel. Endurance takes us in alternating chapters between episodes on the ISS and Kelly's life on earth: growing up with his twin brother, stressing in school over mediocre grades, the typical ""I wasn't great in school, but now I'm an astronaut"" thing. In spite of the fact that this book is about Kelly and his life, I found myself scanning through these chapters and moving onto the space station fodder. I loved learning about how the station works--how Kelly and cohorts eat in space, commit routine tasks, sleep on rotation, the politics of how human bodies endure. The progression of what man can achieve in space is so important to catalogue, and Kelly's memoir will go far in helping us understand the physical and mental toll a year in space can take. "
152,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19389289-paige,4,"It was difficult to put this memoir by former astronaut Scott Kelly down. This is the story of a living hero who comes across as approachable and relatable while also inspiring awe. I had limited background knowledge of the International Space Station or spaceflight, yet I was able to enjoy this book. This contained a fair amount of details and technical descriptions, but I never felt overwhelmed. What made this such an appealing read was that we never lose sight throughout that this is the personal story of an extraordinary man. And as remarkable as his accomplishments are, Scott Kelly the person does not get swallowed up by them. They are part of his experiences and he shares more than sugar coated versions. It was also fascinating to learn details about things including what it is like to prepare to launch into space, to command a space shuttle, and to live in space for a year. This book made me appreciate the space program, earth, and the tenacity of the human spirit."
153,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51021142-katie,5,"I wish I could give this book even more stars! I have read several other books written by astronauts about their time in space and Endurance is, by far, my favorite. The number of details included in this story makes it a very interesting read. Scott adds in many unique insights about his life on the iss, what led him to becoming an astronaut, what he was thinking or experiencing during different times and describing what the technical procedures are for. I highly recommend this book if you are interested in learning details about training, what astronauts experience during launch/reentry and what it is like to live in space."

It's a real eye opener to read a true life experience of an Astronaut of our time. Scott Kelly has a lived a remarkable life. I found him to be surprisingly relatable. Contagious in spirit. Inspirational. Funny. A true soldier. Willing to risk his life for humanity. So grateful for all the Astronauts out there, and Russia for continuing to send people up to space. Definitely a must read!"

I think he has a lot to thank his ghostwriter for, as Kelly's voice comes through loud and clear. Fascinating life, amazing experiences. He strips away the ""glamour"" associated with astronauts, exposing instead the sheer hard work, professionalism, teamwork, pain and ingenuity required. A must read for anyone even slightly interested in what we are doing in space."

159,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2048986-carrie-kellenberger,5,"Captain Scott Kelly has been on four flights to space and he is the US record holder for consecutive number of days spent in space. I don't know of any other person who has lived a life similar to his except for his identical twin brother Mark Kelly, who is also a fighter pilot, captain, and astronaut. Both brothers are also New York Times best-selling authors. I started my 2018 reading journey on two books: Endurance: A Year in Space, A Lifetime of Discovery by Scott Kelly and A Column of Fire by Ken Follett. I have been reading Scott Kelly's book at night and Ken Follett's book during the day. I happened to finish this one first and my oh my - 6 STARS. My hero has kept his hero status - not that I ever doubted Scott Kelly for a second. I've watched him rise in his career for years and followed his last space adventure with abnormal curiosity and utter fascination. Endurance: A Year in Space, A Lifetime of Discovery is a captivating memoir of Scott's journey to space and back to Earth. It also recounts his years of work towards becoming a fighter pilot and his formative years. I loved his writing style and his simple accounts of life in Russia while he was preparing for his flights to space as well as his accounts of life aboard the International Space Station. Time and time again, I was amazed at his observations and his perspectives on leadership, courage under pressure, and the importance of teamwork. Even after reading his book, it is hard for me to wrap my brain around some of the challenges he endured during his year in space and how he kept his cool. From the challenges of taking off and landing to isolation from everything and everyone he knows on Earth to the effects of space on the human body, there are just so many things in this book that made me pause and think. I loved his descriptions of how many types of aircrafts he learned to fly and the endless take offs and landings he performed in order to make his journey to space. I loved the descriptions of his camaraderie with the Russian Cosmonauts in ISS and I marvel at how two countries that were once at war are now co-existing in the same space in SPACE.I loved his compassion, his passion for life, and his sense of humor. I loved that he was able to describe his moments of unease and pain and push through them towards to horizon. There was so much I loved about this book, it is hard to put it all into a review. I've color-coded the whole book for passages I want to refer back to, but in all likelihood, I'll be writing a second review again once I've had a change to reread it. The only thing that really left me feeling dissatisfied with this book is that Captain Kelly doesn't address his issues with being back on Earth. The prologue mentions his pain, swelling and rashes, but the end of the book doesn't mention if these space symptoms have subsided or not. I have often wondered if I'd feel pain in space, and he answers my question thoroughly, but I'd like to know more about how he has done now that he has been back on Earth. Did his symptoms subside? Did they get worse? I guess I'll have to wait for his next book to find out. Either way, this one unanswered question was minuscule in comparison to all the other questions he answered about his year in space. Bravo, Astronaut Scott Kelly!Endurance: A Year in Space, A Lifetime of Discovery is a true testament to the strength of human will and resilience and the endless glory of imagination. Kelly has led a remarkable life, he wrote an incredible book, and the underlying message of hope: to never give up, to always persist at what you want - these are all takeaway lessons that I will remind myself of daily. Thank you, Captain Kelly, for your constant messages of hope and for your bravery and dedication to humanity. Best Takeaway Quotes from my first read: “I've learned that an achievement that seems to have been accomplished by one person probably has hundreds, maybe even thousands, of people's minds and work behind it, and I've learned that it's a privilege to be the embodiment of that work.”― Scott Kelly, Endurance: A Year in Space, A Lifetime of Discovery“What is it worth to see two former bitter enemies transform weapons into transport for exploration and the pursuit of scientific knowledge? What is it worth to see former enemy nations turn their warriors into crewmates and lifelong friends? This is impossible to put a dollar figure on, but to me it’s one of the things that makes this project worth the expense, even worth risking our lives.”― Scott Kelly, Endurance: A Year in Space, A Lifetime of DiscoveryI was up here as the only American with two Russian guys for six weeks this summer...and if something had happened to me, I would have counted on them for my life. We have a great relationship, and I think the international aspect of this program has been one of its highlights.― Scott Kelly, Endurance: A Year in Space, A Lifetime of DiscoveryYet the story of how we kept the space station cool - a huge chunk of metal flying through space getting roasted by the unfiltered sun for forty-five minutes out of every ninety while its enormous solar arrays generate electricity - is a story of engineering triumph with important implications for future space flight.― Scott Kelly, Endurance: A Year in Space, A Lifetime of Discovery"

At first I was relatively uninterested in the biographical aspects of the story, but as the book moved on I became more interested in Kelly and his life. I also enjoyed the glimpses of life aboard the space station. It certainly is not an easy life. "
161,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6904868-molly-mcinturff,5,"A fascinating memoir about Scott Kelly’s childhood, career as a US Navy fighter pilot and NASA astronaut, and his year-long mission at the International Space Station. I truly enjoyed it!"
162,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2526638-claudia-turner,5,"Scott Kelly is one of those rare individuals you meet only a few times in your life who has both a wild passionate soul and keen, calculating sense. He’s like Spock and Kirk rolled into one unforgettable space explorer. The title is fitting because throughout the book he cites the original “Endurance” about Shackleton’s exploration to Antarctica a century ago. Today we have the ISS and astronauts working against government apathy no to mention our understanding of time and space in order to reach into unknown regions of the universe and find if and how we’ll get to Mars. It all starts with a little grit and a lot of determination and Kelly (and his twin brother astronaut Mark Kelly) embody these traits. I’ve read quite a few astronaut and space books the last few years and one thing I’ve noticed is how difficult it is for many astronauts to maintain healthy marriages and relationships in general. There’s a lot of moving and traveling and being MIA for significant life events thats can strain the strongest of relationships. A lot of them didn’t come from cookie cutter backgrounds either and had to surpass life barriers that would break many a man. While everyone has their own perspective on their lives and the people that shaped them, Kelly does his best to understand and relate to the people he left behind even if it seems to fall short at times, like with his ex wife. Yet Kelly had one year at the ISS so a lot of time to really deconstruct his past, his place on earth, and how he got to where he is, and I love this soul searching, introspective type of writing. I also love his sense of humor and appreciation for minute details like with the flowers and toilet upon the ISS. Any great man/woman knows that greatness can’t exist without a lot of time given to all that appears trivial and inconsequential. All the little moments and the mundane aspects of life must be cared for and nurtured before “greatness” can be achieved. I appreciate Kelly’s thoughtfulness, his compassion, and most of all his adventurous spirit. He’s a true modern day explorer, a candid philosopher of sorts, and he would have made Shackleton proud."

Kimberly is even hosting a buddy read of it in July for her #greatspaceread!Endurance is one of those space memoirs that is mostly about the human condition and not about the science. I suck at science, but I LOVED this book and could not stop listening. At its core, this book is about a man’s willingness to go to almost any length to be a human lab rat for NASA to better understand space and our place within it.Kelly and his twin brother allowed their DNA to be used for research to help us figure out how to get to Mars. Scott lived on the ISS for a year while his twin stayed in Earth. But before all of that, Scott was your average teenager who didn’t know what to do with his life or how to take school serious. Then he read a book that gave him a clear goal, and he didn’t stop until he achieved that goal: flying a space shuttle.This book is full of jaw dropping moments. Moments you wouldn’t believe except, well, they did happen to Scott! I highly recommend this book to everyone and think we all can learn so much from Scott’s story.If you are looking for more on Scott and this year in space mission, there is a Netflix docuseries called....wait for it... A YEAR IN SPACE. But don’t watch it and hope to pass Kimberly’s Endurance test. She’ll know you cheated and didn’t read it."
164,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1384639-sandra,5,"As someone who has attended so many shuttle launches (one of which was Mr. Kelly’s flight in 1999) and landings and dreams of what its like to be in space, I was stoked to find out I was being given Endurance by Scott Kelly to review. I find outer space fascinating I follow the flight paths of the International Space Station (ISS)(which oddly enough will be crossing over my home at 6:22 p.m. tonight, and I am planning on watching it travel along on its journey with my high power binoculars). This book adds to my fascination. Retired Astronaut Scott Kelly is the longest occupying American resident of the ISS with 340 straight days in 2015-2016. Endurance is his memoir of that record-breaking stay and the rest of his “Lifetime of Discovery.” Selected to a ""year-long mission"" starting with Expedition 43, he then commanded Expedition 44 and 45, Mr. Kelly had put into practice what it was like to live on the Space Station two years before with his 5 months stay on the ISS during Expedition 26. His life journey through hardships in his childhood, his service in the Navy as a Pilot, fighting Prostate Cancer and those months of Expedition 43 prepared him for what came next. Endurance is the closest I will ever get to space and I ate up every word Mr. Kelly wrote. His struggles from being away from his family, his relationships, his joys, his mental and physical health, working with various countries Astronauts delving in Biomedical Engineering, his vivid explanations of the day to day jobs he completed were like a sci-fi novel turned reality. Can you imagine what it would be like to look at the earth and see it in all its glory, it’s distinguishing attributes? You don’t have to, Mr. Kelly gives you his view and feelings on what it is like. He makes you feel as if you are there, working, playing and traveling through zero gravity. The knowledge that you don’t have control over anything that happens on earth to your family is something that Mr. Kelly finds out about when his sister-in-law Congresswoman Gabriella Giffords is shot in Arizona at a Safeway grocery store parking lot meeting with constituents. Mr. Kelly had a few months left of his stay. A few things of what Mr. Kelly says of that experience, while leading the nation in a moment of silence concerning the horrific assassination attempt and deaths of six people and 13 injured that day in Tucson struck me as something to really chew on and change, and also some huge foreshadowing, “Those of us who have had the privilege to look down on the Earth from space get the chance to take a larger perspective of the planet and the people who share it. I feel more strongly than ever that we must do better” He explains after the moment of silence ""on the space station, we followed our normal routine. But I knew that on Earth somethings would never be the same.” Mr. Kelly’s life experiences told throughout this book show everyone that someone can come from obscurity and land into whatever they dream of becoming and beyond those dreams. This book is worth reading especially if you have any inkling of journeying from your own life to someone else’s and obviously if you love space exploration. This book hits one of my top five memoirs. Read it, you won’t regret it. Thanks to Bookish First for sending me a copy of Endurance: A Year in Space, A lifetime of Discovery I thoroughly enjoyed it. This book was given to me in lieu of my honest opinion."
165,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12691311-debbie,5,"I liked this book a lot! It was very interesting and held my interest throughout. Scott Kelly is a very funny guy and I liked how put that into the book. I learned a lot about the space industry. Most of it, I didn’t know. I certainly didn’t realize that there are still astronauts and that we are using Russia’s facilities. I now a little secret about dill, as well. Ha!! I think it’s great that we are cooperating with Russia in order to learn more about space and the secrets it holds. So many different things that I learned about were very extraordinary. A really good book that I enjoyed very much. Thanks to Bookish for providing me with a free copy of the book (a hard copy) in order for me to review."
166,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4474787-mimi,4,"Not only is the title a nod to Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage and it is interwoven in Kelly's time on the space station, but the reason that Scott goes into NASA is Tom Wolfe's The Right Stuff. I loved that reading was so integral to this story and loved Kelly's voice, history, and observations. It could have been a dry tome and was pleasantly live. "
167,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12765668-linda,4,"Capt. Scott Kelly, USN, a US astronaut extraordinaire, tells the compelling story of his life’s journey from a modest and underachieving childhood, to reading a book that changed his life, to becoming a Navy test pilot, then being accepted, along with his twin brother Mark, into the space program, and eventually taking up residence on the International Space Station for a full year. What an amazing adventure story! Scott isn’t a professional writer, and he had someone (Margaret Lazarus Dean) co-write with him, but Endurance felt like Scott told it his way, showing his faults as well as his triumphs, and teaching his readers enough about space travel to feel like we were almost along for the ride with him. I liked it a lot, scientific jargon notwithstanding."
168,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1432957-alison,5,"I’ll never go to space, but this book is a great replacement. Kelly’s account of his career and year in space captivated me. His writing is sometimes conversational, sometimes polished and poetic. His reflections on life after a year at the International Space Station are worth returning to again and again. I have a new respect for what it takes—mentally, physically, emotionally—to be an astronaut. I’ll be recommending this one for a while. “I’ve learned that an achievement that seems to have been accomplished by one person probably has hundreds, maybe even thousands, of people’s minds and work behind it, and I’ve learned that it’s a privilege to be the embodiment of that work.”"

From being 18 and captivated by Tom Wolfe’s The Right Stuff, to setting lofty, personal academic and professional goals, Scott Kelly proves that you can do “hard things” when you set your mind to it. Great book!"

He has a very relaxed, witty style of writing and I enjoyed the jokes thrown in. It also wasn't so technical that you couldn't understand what he was talking about on the ISS. Highly recommend!"
172,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67612372-megan,3,"Oh my god, astronauts are so much braver than I thought.You know–everyone knows–deep down, that astronauts are a little bit crazy. They voluntarily launch themselves away from Earth at the speed of sound on top of a rocket that might be a bomb if it’s not regulated or cooled properly or if a tiny bolt is out of place, so that they can go explore what happens to people in a place that is passively trying to kill them at all times. Scott Kelly and his Russian counterpart, Misha Kornienko, lived up there for a year. In an environment that was gravity-less, water-less, air-less…people-less. The maximum number of people who were on the International Space Station while the two of them were completing their year in space was nine. Nine people to substitute the entire human race.Kelly’s anecdotes about the life on the ISS are brutally real, but told in such a matter-of-fact way that you almost forget the dangers. He reminds you, of course, that something as simple as fixing the toilet is a project of vital importance and that if a single bolt or screw goes floating off into the depths of the station, it might be lost forever. But it’s also funny to think about someone having the fix the toilet that’s in space. Kelly doesn’t shy away from these bits of humor, and even finds ways to make the tales of life-and-death zero-g shenanigans lighthearted and interesting. But there’s an underlying intensity that feels sort of like what I imagine living in space might feel like: you have to laugh at the monstrous vacuum trying to kill you, otherwise it will be too overwhelming to continue.Interspersed with tales from the ISS are chapters of how Scott Kelly became an astronaut. It was a long journey for him, from terrible student to Navy test pilot to various NASA jobs–space shuttle pilot, astronaut liaison with the Russian space agency, and finally long-flight mission astronaut. It’s quite a wild ride with various colorful characters and it shows a great resilience in Kelly, a perseverance and a determination that are incredibly important qualities in an astronaut.This book was very accessible–all of the hard science was explained in terms simple enough that even the most English-major-y of nerds (me) could understand. There were some technical bits that were a bit dense, but it was well worth reading through them to understand just how difficult rocket science really is. Or…space station science, I suppose. Anyone who read and enjoyed Andy Weir’s The Martian will probably like this book for similar reasons–fascinating scientific and technological explanations interspersed with a quiet sense of humor and personal journey narrative that disperses the intensity of the situation, but doesn’t detract from it.I highly recommend this book for lovers of space, for anyone who grew up looking at the stars and wishing they could walk among them. Reading Endurance is a little bit like living vicariously through Scott Kelly–maybe you’re the not one going on spacewalks and floating over to the Russian module for Friday dinners, but the sense of wonder and kinship between humanity and the starts is closer and more real. It’s a fascinating look at life in space and what it takes to get there–determination, a good sense of humor, an unparalleled strength, bravery, and…well, endurance."
173,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33105402-tyson,5,"“There's a starman waiting in the skyHe'd like to come and meet usBut he thinks he'd blow our mindsThere's a starman waiting in the skyHe's told us not to blow itCause he knows it's all worthwhile”Scott Kelly defines hard work in his career path to becoming an astronaut. His book does every justice to explain how he reached a point in his life where he become one of the only human beings to have the privilege to spend an entire year in outer space. His writing is enough to make even a person with minimal interest in space exploration envious of his opportunity.This was Kelly’s first book, which is not surprising because he seems to have been rather busy in the years preceding it. He worked hard to overcome obstacles, both personal and professional. For the most part, he seems like a no-nonsense kind of guy, a man who understands that in order to reach goals, much of it is the perseverance to help yourself. It is a quality that holds high importance in space, where there is nobody to hold your hand and resolve issues for you. Kelly’s attitude is not only symbolic but a literal protocol in his journey through 340 days spent on the International Space Station.Anybody can write a book about what they do. Whether it is a politician or a professional ball player, autobiographies have the capability to let us into the minds and lives of people who live in ways most of us probably won’t ever experience. But Kelly’s book is different. It is harder to wrap your head around, a grossly more monumental production because of all it entails. He leaves the planet, lives primarily on his own, and is responsible for things that we, as gravity-stuck humans, only know nature for taking care of (like providing air to breathe or keeping our food on our plates). Things we don’t blink an eye at, he faced as trials and tribulations, inhibitions to simple tasks like eating, moving, sleeping, and basic life functions.Please take the time to read this book. Please find Kelly’s social media accounts (Instagram most importantly) and follow along. Kelly, who had to learn how to do so many things to further his career, his personal life, and his days in space, has seemed to naturally add another to his list when he wrote this autobiography. It is a wonderful addition to the adventurous genre of travel."

Intensely interesting if you've ever wondered how the International Space Station functions. Lots of insights about the actual science of space travel with an emphasis on the hardships and how they apply to traveling to Mars. This book will make you watch all your favorite sci/fi films and read all your sci/fi books in a new light. Space is scary. Real scary. 
175,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6014143-dena,3,I really liked Scott Kelly's memoir. I have no desire myself to push the boundaries of space and his ability to share the joys as well as the hardships of it was fascinating. This is real space.

179,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1976637-jeff,4,"If my Wisconsin math is correct, this is my sixth astronaut memoir /biography/ autobiography and I'd rank it in that collection behind only the Sally Ride and Mike Massimino books. Scott Kelly is the American astronaut selected to spend a year in space aboard the ISS and this is his story of that experience. Actually, the book jumps back and forth between long mission on the ISS and the backstory of how he got there. I found both to be interesting, however, I was much more intrigued by his experiences in space. I listened to Endurance in audio. Scott's narration was straight ahead and usually without emotion or much inflection, unlike the book self-narrated by astronaut Mike Massimino who is a natural storyteller and hilarious. Still, Scott was a competent storyteller and had a knack for explaining the technical aspects of his life, and did throw some humor in here and there. He named his book Endurance after Shackleton's ship which was destroyed in his ill-fated journey to the South Pole. He brought Shackleton's book to space in order to remind himself that no matter how hard life became in space was it wasn't as bad as what Shackleton's expedition went through. The times he spent in space including the travel to and from space, were fascinating and covered not only his year-long stint on the ISS, but is first six-month ISS mission as well has his space shuttle missions and trips on the Soyuz. He does a nice job documenting his unique experiences in a relatable way. Scott and his Russian counterpart (who also spent a year on the ISS) were pushed to the physical limits living in zero G for so long and pushed to the mental limits knowing that they were away from friends and loved ones (and the whole damn Earth!) for a year. Scott said several times his biggest fear was that something bad would happen to one of his family members while he was in space as there would be nothing he could do to help. Sure enough, his sister-in-law congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords of AZ was shot in the head during a public appearance in Tucson. All he could do was watch the TV coverage from space. Some of the most interesting parts of the book for me were his comparisons of the Russian and American space agencies. Surprisingly, they both had very different sets of rules and philosophies, not to mention the differences between the Soyuz and the now-retired Space Shuttles. Some of his terrestrial stories were less interesting, like the unraveling of his marriage and troubles with his daughters. One of the unique things about Scott's time in space was that his identical twin, Mark, was on earth and was Scott's experimental control for the tests about the long term effects of living in space on Scott's body. Their almost identical physiology and DNA could be compared. The book ends shortly after Scott returns to earth so the results of these experiments were not included in the book. I guess that's what Google is for. One of Scott's final comments was an echo of the messages I've heard from other astronauts: from space the Earth appears to be an oasis in an infinite backdrop of stars and other galaxies, all too far to reach, so we humans need to get our act together and treat it as the special place it is. There is no plan B. "
180,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3030161-ericka-seidemann,5,"Wow. Just, wow.  This memoir is a page-turner from start to finish, and I appreciated that it wasn't structured chronologically, but rather followed Kelly's storytelling with flashbacks and flashforwards to create a riveting narrative.  Endurance is not just about Kelly's time on the ISS, but also delves into the training that led up to his becoming an astronaut. All of Kelly's experiences, from his time as an EMT on an ambulance to his career in the military flying fighter jets, contributed to his skill of calm focus in the face of extremes necessary to command the ISS. He also gives credit to those who molded and guided him on his journey, including his mom, who became the first female police officer in their home town of West Orange, New Jersey.  As ""civilians,"" we're fortunate to have this intimate glimpse into day-to-day life in space, and how the astronaut-adventurers come together to handle adversities, from space walk repairs to those dreaded phone calls from earth that something may be wrong with their loved ones back home. Endurance provides food for thought about our relationships with other nations and how precious our home planet truly is.  I had to carry a book of tape flags with me while reading this because I had to mark so many eye-opening passages that I didn't want to forget. I tortured my family with expositions and factoids that began, ""Listen to this, I read in Scott Kelly's book . . . ""  Without a doubt, you want to read this.  Many thanks to BookishFirst and Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group for the copy in exchange for my honest review. "
181,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33718320-samantha-colwell,3,"I received a copy of this book from Penguin Random House for an honest review.Scott Kelly's Endurance is a study in human achievement and the ISS is really the star of the show. Don't get me wrong--Scott Kelly is an interesting, personable, funny narrator, and his memoir is cohesive and strong. But the international space station, the way it functions and its purpose, is the most fascinating part of the novel. Endurance takes us in alternating chapters between episodes on the ISS and Kelly's life on earth: growing up with his twin brother, stressing in school over mediocre grades, the typical ""I wasn't great in school, but now I'm an astronaut"" thing. In spite of the fact that this book is about Kelly and his life, I found myself scanning through these chapters and moving onto the space station fodder. I loved learning about how the station works--how Kelly and cohorts eat in space, commit routine tasks, sleep on rotation, the politics of how human bodies endure. The progression of what man can achieve in space is so important to catalogue, and Kelly's memoir will go far in helping us understand the physical and mental toll a year in space can take. "
182,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19389289-paige,4,"It was difficult to put this memoir by former astronaut Scott Kelly down. This is the story of a living hero who comes across as approachable and relatable while also inspiring awe. I had limited background knowledge of the International Space Station or spaceflight, yet I was able to enjoy this book. This contained a fair amount of details and technical descriptions, but I never felt overwhelmed. What made this such an appealing read was that we never lose sight throughout that this is the personal story of an extraordinary man. And as remarkable as his accomplishments are, Scott Kelly the person does not get swallowed up by them. They are part of his experiences and he shares more than sugar coated versions. It was also fascinating to learn details about things including what it is like to prepare to launch into space, to command a space shuttle, and to live in space for a year. This book made me appreciate the space program, earth, and the tenacity of the human spirit."

I have read several other books written by astronauts about their time in space and Endurance is, by far, my favorite. The number of details included in this story makes it a very interesting read. Scott adds in many unique insights about his life on the iss, what led him to becoming an astronaut, what he was thinking or experiencing during different times and describing what the technical procedures are for. I highly recommend this book if you are interested in learning details about training, what astronauts experience during launch/reentry and what it is like to live in space."

I don't know of any other person who has lived a life similar to his except for his identical twin brother Mark Kelly, who is also a fighter pilot, captain, and astronaut. Both brothers are also New York Times best-selling authors. I started my 2018 reading journey on two books: Endurance: A Year in Space, A Lifetime of Discovery by Scott Kelly and A Column of Fire by Ken Follett. I have been reading Scott Kelly's book at night and Ken Follett's book during the day. I happened to finish this one first and my oh my - 6 STARS. My hero has kept his hero status - not that I ever doubted Scott Kelly for a second. I've watched him rise in his career for years and followed his last space adventure with abnormal curiosity and utter fascination. Endurance: A Year in Space, A Lifetime of Discovery is a captivating memoir of Scott's journey to space and back to Earth. It also recounts his years of work towards becoming a fighter pilot and his formative years. I loved his writing style and his simple accounts of life in Russia while he was preparing for his flights to space as well as his accounts of life aboard the International Space Station. Time and time again, I was amazed at his observations and his perspectives on leadership, courage under pressure, and the importance of teamwork. Even after reading his book, it is hard for me to wrap my brain around some of the challenges he endured during his year in space and how he kept his cool. From the challenges of taking off and landing to isolation from everything and everyone he knows on Earth to the effects of space on the human body, there are just so many things in this book that made me pause and think. I loved his descriptions of how many types of aircrafts he learned to fly and the endless take offs and landings he performed in order to make his journey to space. I loved the descriptions of his camaraderie with the Russian Cosmonauts in ISS and I marvel at how two countries that were once at war are now co-existing in the same space in SPACE.I loved his compassion, his passion for life, and his sense of humor. I loved that he was able to describe his moments of unease and pain and push through them towards to horizon. There was so much I loved about this book, it is hard to put it all into a review. I've color-coded the whole book for passages I want to refer back to, but in all likelihood, I'll be writing a second review again once I've had a change to reread it. The only thing that really left me feeling dissatisfied with this book is that Captain Kelly doesn't address his issues with being back on Earth. The prologue mentions his pain, swelling and rashes, but the end of the book doesn't mention if these space symptoms have subsided or not. I have often wondered if I'd feel pain in space, and he answers my question thoroughly, but I'd like to know more about how he has done now that he has been back on Earth. Did his symptoms subside? Did they get worse? I guess I'll have to wait for his next book to find out. Either way, this one unanswered question was minuscule in comparison to all the other questions he answered about his year in space. Bravo, Astronaut Scott Kelly!Endurance: A Year in Space, A Lifetime of Discovery is a true testament to the strength of human will and resilience and the endless glory of imagination. Kelly has led a remarkable life, he wrote an incredible book, and the underlying message of hope: to never give up, to always persist at what you want - these are all takeaway lessons that I will remind myself of daily. Thank you, Captain Kelly, for your constant messages of hope and for your bravery and dedication to humanity. Best Takeaway Quotes from my first read: “I've learned that an achievement that seems to have been accomplished by one person probably has hundreds, maybe even thousands, of people's minds and work behind it, and I've learned that it's a privilege to be the embodiment of that work.”― Scott Kelly, Endurance: A Year in Space, A Lifetime of Discovery“What is it worth to see two former bitter enemies transform weapons into transport for exploration and the pursuit of scientific knowledge? What is it worth to see former enemy nations turn their warriors into crewmates and lifelong friends? This is impossible to put a dollar figure on, but to me it’s one of the things that makes this project worth the expense, even worth risking our lives.”― Scott Kelly, Endurance: A Year in Space, A Lifetime of DiscoveryI was up here as the only American with two Russian guys for six weeks this summer...and if something had happened to me, I would have counted on them for my life. We have a great relationship, and I think the international aspect of this program has been one of its highlights.― Scott Kelly, Endurance: A Year in Space, A Lifetime of DiscoveryYet the story of how we kept the space station cool - a huge chunk of metal flying through space getting roasted by the unfiltered sun for forty-five minutes out of every ninety while its enormous solar arrays generate electricity - is a story of engineering triumph with important implications for future space flight.― Scott Kelly, Endurance: A Year in Space, A Lifetime of Discovery"

At first I was relatively uninterested in the biographical aspects of the story, but as the book moved on I became more interested in Kelly and his life. I also enjoyed the glimpses of life aboard the space station. It certainly is not an easy life. "
191,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6904868-molly-mcinturff,5,"A fascinating memoir about Scott Kelly’s childhood, career as a US Navy fighter pilot and NASA astronaut, and his year-long mission at the International Space Station. I truly enjoyed it!"
192,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2526638-claudia-turner,5,"Scott Kelly is one of those rare individuals you meet only a few times in your life who has both a wild passionate soul and keen, calculating sense. He’s like Spock and Kirk rolled into one unforgettable space explorer. The title is fitting because throughout the book he cites the original “Endurance” about Shackleton’s exploration to Antarctica a century ago. Today we have the ISS and astronauts working against government apathy no to mention our understanding of time and space in order to reach into unknown regions of the universe and find if and how we’ll get to Mars. It all starts with a little grit and a lot of determination and Kelly (and his twin brother astronaut Mark Kelly) embody these traits. I’ve read quite a few astronaut and space books the last few years and one thing I’ve noticed is how difficult it is for many astronauts to maintain healthy marriages and relationships in general. There’s a lot of moving and traveling and being MIA for significant life events thats can strain the strongest of relationships. A lot of them didn’t come from cookie cutter backgrounds either and had to surpass life barriers that would break many a man. While everyone has their own perspective on their lives and the people that shaped them, Kelly does his best to understand and relate to the people he left behind even if it seems to fall short at times, like with his ex wife. Yet Kelly had one year at the ISS so a lot of time to really deconstruct his past, his place on earth, and how he got to where he is, and I love this soul searching, introspective type of writing. I also love his sense of humor and appreciation for minute details like with the flowers and toilet upon the ISS. Any great man/woman knows that greatness can’t exist without a lot of time given to all that appears trivial and inconsequential. All the little moments and the mundane aspects of life must be cared for and nurtured before “greatness” can be achieved. I appreciate Kelly’s thoughtfulness, his compassion, and most of all his adventurous spirit. He’s a true modern day explorer, a candid philosopher of sorts, and he would have made Shackleton proud."

Kimberly is even hosting a buddy read of it in July for her #greatspaceread!Endurance is one of those space memoirs that is mostly about the human condition and not about the science. I suck at science, but I LOVED this book and could not stop listening. At its core, this book is about a man’s willingness to go to almost any length to be a human lab rat for NASA to better understand space and our place within it.Kelly and his twin brother allowed their DNA to be used for research to help us figure out how to get to Mars. Scott lived on the ISS for a year while his twin stayed in Earth. But before all of that, Scott was your average teenager who didn’t know what to do with his life or how to take school serious. Then he read a book that gave him a clear goal, and he didn’t stop until he achieved that goal: flying a space shuttle.This book is full of jaw dropping moments. Moments you wouldn’t believe except, well, they did happen to Scott! I highly recommend this book to everyone and think we all can learn so much from Scott’s story.If you are looking for more on Scott and this year in space mission, there is a Netflix docuseries called....wait for it... A YEAR IN SPACE. But don’t watch it and hope to pass Kimberly’s Endurance test. She’ll know you cheated and didn’t read it."
194,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1384639-sandra,5,"As someone who has attended so many shuttle launches (one of which was Mr. Kelly’s flight in 1999) and landings and dreams of what its like to be in space, I was stoked to find out I was being given Endurance by Scott Kelly to review. I find outer space fascinating I follow the flight paths of the International Space Station (ISS)(which oddly enough will be crossing over my home at 6:22 p.m. tonight, and I am planning on watching it travel along on its journey with my high power binoculars). This book adds to my fascination. Retired Astronaut Scott Kelly is the longest occupying American resident of the ISS with 340 straight days in 2015-2016. Endurance is his memoir of that record-breaking stay and the rest of his “Lifetime of Discovery.” Selected to a ""year-long mission"" starting with Expedition 43, he then commanded Expedition 44 and 45, Mr. Kelly had put into practice what it was like to live on the Space Station two years before with his 5 months stay on the ISS during Expedition 26. His life journey through hardships in his childhood, his service in the Navy as a Pilot, fighting Prostate Cancer and those months of Expedition 43 prepared him for what came next. Endurance is the closest I will ever get to space and I ate up every word Mr. Kelly wrote. His struggles from being away from his family, his relationships, his joys, his mental and physical health, working with various countries Astronauts delving in Biomedical Engineering, his vivid explanations of the day to day jobs he completed were like a sci-fi novel turned reality. Can you imagine what it would be like to look at the earth and see it in all its glory, it’s distinguishing attributes? You don’t have to, Mr. Kelly gives you his view and feelings on what it is like. He makes you feel as if you are there, working, playing and traveling through zero gravity. The knowledge that you don’t have control over anything that happens on earth to your family is something that Mr. Kelly finds out about when his sister-in-law Congresswoman Gabriella Giffords is shot in Arizona at a Safeway grocery store parking lot meeting with constituents. Mr. Kelly had a few months left of his stay. A few things of what Mr. Kelly says of that experience, while leading the nation in a moment of silence concerning the horrific assassination attempt and deaths of six people and 13 injured that day in Tucson struck me as something to really chew on and change, and also some huge foreshadowing, “Those of us who have had the privilege to look down on the Earth from space get the chance to take a larger perspective of the planet and the people who share it. I feel more strongly than ever that we must do better” He explains after the moment of silence ""on the space station, we followed our normal routine. But I knew that on Earth somethings would never be the same.” Mr. Kelly’s life experiences told throughout this book show everyone that someone can come from obscurity and land into whatever they dream of becoming and beyond those dreams. This book is worth reading especially if you have any inkling of journeying from your own life to someone else’s and obviously if you love space exploration. This book hits one of my top five memoirs. Read it, you won’t regret it. Thanks to Bookish First for sending me a copy of Endurance: A Year in Space, A lifetime of Discovery I thoroughly enjoyed it. This book was given to me in lieu of my honest opinion."
195,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12691311-debbie,5,"I liked this book a lot! It was very interesting and held my interest throughout. Scott Kelly is a very funny guy and I liked how put that into the book. I learned a lot about the space industry. Most of it, I didn’t know. I certainly didn’t realize that there are still astronauts and that we are using Russia’s facilities. I now a little secret about dill, as well. Ha!! I think it’s great that we are cooperating with Russia in order to learn more about space and the secrets it holds. So many different things that I learned about were very extraordinary. A really good book that I enjoyed very much. Thanks to Bookish for providing me with a free copy of the book (a hard copy) in order for me to review."
196,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4474787-mimi,4,"Not only is the title a nod to Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage and it is interwoven in Kelly's time on the space station, but the reason that Scott goes into NASA is Tom Wolfe's The Right Stuff. I loved that reading was so integral to this story and loved Kelly's voice, history, and observations. It could have been a dry tome and was pleasantly live. "
197,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12765668-linda,4,"Capt. Scott Kelly, USN, a US astronaut extraordinaire, tells the compelling story of his life’s journey from a modest and underachieving childhood, to reading a book that changed his life, to becoming a Navy test pilot, then being accepted, along with his twin brother Mark, into the space program, and eventually taking up residence on the International Space Station for a full year. What an amazing adventure story! Scott isn’t a professional writer, and he had someone (Margaret Lazarus Dean) co-write with him, but Endurance felt like Scott told it his way, showing his faults as well as his triumphs, and teaching his readers enough about space travel to feel like we were almost along for the ride with him. I liked it a lot, scientific jargon notwithstanding."
198,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1432957-alison,5,"I’ll never go to space, but this book is a great replacement. Kelly’s account of his career and year in space captivated me. His writing is sometimes conversational, sometimes polished and poetic. His reflections on life after a year at the International Space Station are worth returning to again and again. I have a new respect for what it takes—mentally, physically, emotionally—to be an astronaut. I’ll be recommending this one for a while. “I’ve learned that an achievement that seems to have been accomplished by one person probably has hundreds, maybe even thousands, of people’s minds and work behind it, and I’ve learned that it’s a privilege to be the embodiment of that work.”"
199,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28613204-sara,5,"Fascinating first-hand account of astronaut Scott Kelly’s year aboard the International Space Station (ISS) and the insights he gained about life, family, and the future. From being 18 and captivated by Tom Wolfe’s The Right Stuff, to setting lofty, personal academic and professional goals, Scott Kelly proves that you can do “hard things” when you set your mind to it. Great book!"
200,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6005592-elena,2,Wasn't a masterpiece. I had to skip a lot and got really bored toward the end. It could have worked better if someone else had written it.
201,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10074653-dana,5,"Excellent book! I loved learning about his training and education to become an astronaut, as well as his time on the ISS. He has a very relaxed, witty style of writing and I enjoyed the jokes thrown in. It also wasn't so technical that you couldn't understand what he was talking about on the ISS. Highly recommend!"
202,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67612372-megan,3,"Oh my god, astronauts are so much braver than I thought.You know–everyone knows–deep down, that astronauts are a little bit crazy. They voluntarily launch themselves away from Earth at the speed of sound on top of a rocket that might be a bomb if it’s not regulated or cooled properly or if a tiny bolt is out of place, so that they can go explore what happens to people in a place that is passively trying to kill them at all times. Scott Kelly and his Russian counterpart, Misha Kornienko, lived up there for a year. In an environment that was gravity-less, water-less, air-less…people-less. The maximum number of people who were on the International Space Station while the two of them were completing their year in space was nine. Nine people to substitute the entire human race.Kelly’s anecdotes about the life on the ISS are brutally real, but told in such a matter-of-fact way that you almost forget the dangers. He reminds you, of course, that something as simple as fixing the toilet is a project of vital importance and that if a single bolt or screw goes floating off into the depths of the station, it might be lost forever. But it’s also funny to think about someone having the fix the toilet that’s in space. Kelly doesn’t shy away from these bits of humor, and even finds ways to make the tales of life-and-death zero-g shenanigans lighthearted and interesting. But there’s an underlying intensity that feels sort of like what I imagine living in space might feel like: you have to laugh at the monstrous vacuum trying to kill you, otherwise it will be too overwhelming to continue.Interspersed with tales from the ISS are chapters of how Scott Kelly became an astronaut. It was a long journey for him, from terrible student to Navy test pilot to various NASA jobs–space shuttle pilot, astronaut liaison with the Russian space agency, and finally long-flight mission astronaut. It’s quite a wild ride with various colorful characters and it shows a great resilience in Kelly, a perseverance and a determination that are incredibly important qualities in an astronaut.This book was very accessible–all of the hard science was explained in terms simple enough that even the most English-major-y of nerds (me) could understand. There were some technical bits that were a bit dense, but it was well worth reading through them to understand just how difficult rocket science really is. Or…space station science, I suppose. Anyone who read and enjoyed Andy Weir’s The Martian will probably like this book for similar reasons–fascinating scientific and technological explanations interspersed with a quiet sense of humor and personal journey narrative that disperses the intensity of the situation, but doesn’t detract from it.I highly recommend this book for lovers of space, for anyone who grew up looking at the stars and wishing they could walk among them. Reading Endurance is a little bit like living vicariously through Scott Kelly–maybe you’re the not one going on spacewalks and floating over to the Russian module for Friday dinners, but the sense of wonder and kinship between humanity and the starts is closer and more real. It’s a fascinating look at life in space and what it takes to get there–determination, a good sense of humor, an unparalleled strength, bravery, and…well, endurance."
203,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33105402-tyson,5,"“There's a starman waiting in the skyHe'd like to come and meet usBut he thinks he'd blow our mindsThere's a starman waiting in the skyHe's told us not to blow itCause he knows it's all worthwhile”Scott Kelly defines hard work in his career path to becoming an astronaut. His book does every justice to explain how he reached a point in his life where he become one of the only human beings to have the privilege to spend an entire year in outer space. His writing is enough to make even a person with minimal interest in space exploration envious of his opportunity.This was Kelly’s first book, which is not surprising because he seems to have been rather busy in the years preceding it. He worked hard to overcome obstacles, both personal and professional. For the most part, he seems like a no-nonsense kind of guy, a man who understands that in order to reach goals, much of it is the perseverance to help yourself. It is a quality that holds high importance in space, where there is nobody to hold your hand and resolve issues for you. Kelly’s attitude is not only symbolic but a literal protocol in his journey through 340 days spent on the International Space Station.Anybody can write a book about what they do. Whether it is a politician or a professional ball player, autobiographies have the capability to let us into the minds and lives of people who live in ways most of us probably won’t ever experience. But Kelly’s book is different. It is harder to wrap your head around, a grossly more monumental production because of all it entails. He leaves the planet, lives primarily on his own, and is responsible for things that we, as gravity-stuck humans, only know nature for taking care of (like providing air to breathe or keeping our food on our plates). Things we don’t blink an eye at, he faced as trials and tribulations, inhibitions to simple tasks like eating, moving, sleeping, and basic life functions.Please take the time to read this book. Please find Kelly’s social media accounts (Instagram most importantly) and follow along. Kelly, who had to learn how to do so many things to further his career, his personal life, and his days in space, has seemed to naturally add another to his list when he wrote this autobiography. It is a wonderful addition to the adventurous genre of travel."
204,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27943513-brian-mccue,4,A brief biography of Scott Kelly's life and his recent year-long stay in the ISS. Intensely interesting if you've ever wondered how the International Space Station functions. Lots of insights about the actual science of space travel with an emphasis on the hardships and how they apply to traveling to Mars. This book will make you watch all your favorite sci/fi films and read all your sci/fi books in a new light. Space is scary. Real scary. 
205,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6014143-dena,3,I really liked Scott Kelly's memoir. I have no desire myself to push the boundaries of space and his ability to share the joys as well as the hardships of it was fascinating. This is real space. Not sci-fi or Diet Space and certainly not for the claustrophobic or weak of stomach. Off to stalk Kelly's IG account.
206,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47219750-joanna-martin,2,"The book is very interesting and Scott's stories are once in a lifetime but I couldn't help to notice how conceited he sounds talking about all the ""cool"" things he's done. I'm sure he's better in person but from this book, I'm not sure I would want to meet him. A little disappointed."
207,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27176662-ford,2,Learned more about space travel but found I didn't like Scott Kelly. I also realized we are wasting money on manned space travel. Forget putting men on Mars and send probes and more space telescopes. 
208,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6837622-yoly,5,Great memoir. Amazing man.
209,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1976637-jeff,4,"If my Wisconsin math is correct, this is my sixth astronaut memoir /biography/ autobiography and I'd rank it in that collection behind only the Sally Ride and Mike Massimino books. Scott Kelly is the American astronaut selected to spend a year in space aboard the ISS and this is his story of that experience. Actually, the book jumps back and forth between long mission on the ISS and the backstory of how he got there. I found both to be interesting, however, I was much more intrigued by his experiences in space. I listened to Endurance in audio. Scott's narration was straight ahead and usually without emotion or much inflection, unlike the book self-narrated by astronaut Mike Massimino who is a natural storyteller and hilarious. Still, Scott was a competent storyteller and had a knack for explaining the technical aspects of his life, and did throw some humor in here and there. He named his book Endurance after Shackleton's ship which was destroyed in his ill-fated journey to the South Pole. He brought Shackleton's book to space in order to remind himself that no matter how hard life became in space was it wasn't as bad as what Shackleton's expedition went through. The times he spent in space including the travel to and from space, were fascinating and covered not only his year-long stint on the ISS, but is first six-month ISS mission as well has his space shuttle missions and trips on the Soyuz. He does a nice job documenting his unique experiences in a relatable way. Scott and his Russian counterpart (who also spent a year on the ISS) were pushed to the physical limits living in zero G for so long and pushed to the mental limits knowing that they were away from friends and loved ones (and the whole damn Earth!) for a year. Scott said several times his biggest fear was that something bad would happen to one of his family members while he was in space as there would be nothing he could do to help. Sure enough, his sister-in-law congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords of AZ was shot in the head during a public appearance in Tucson. All he could do was watch the TV coverage from space. Some of the most interesting parts of the book for me were his comparisons of the Russian and American space agencies. Surprisingly, they both had very different sets of rules and philosophies, not to mention the differences between the Soyuz and the now-retired Space Shuttles. Some of his terrestrial stories were less interesting, like the unraveling of his marriage and troubles with his daughters. One of the unique things about Scott's time in space was that his identical twin, Mark, was on earth and was Scott's experimental control for the tests about the long term effects of living in space on Scott's body. Their almost identical physiology and DNA could be compared. The book ends shortly after Scott returns to earth so the results of these experiments were not included in the book. I guess that's what Google is for. One of Scott's final comments was an echo of the messages I've heard from other astronauts: from space the Earth appears to be an oasis in an infinite backdrop of stars and other galaxies, all too far to reach, so we humans need to get our act together and treat it as the special place it is. There is no plan B. "
210,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3030161-ericka-seidemann,5,"Wow. Just, wow.  This memoir is a page-turner from start to finish, and I appreciated that it wasn't structured chronologically, but rather followed Kelly's storytelling with flashbacks and flashforwards to create a riveting narrative.  Endurance is not just about Kelly's time on the ISS, but also delves into the training that led up to his becoming an astronaut. All of Kelly's experiences, from his time as an EMT on an ambulance to his career in the military flying fighter jets, contributed to his skill of calm focus in the face of extremes necessary to command the ISS. He also gives credit to those who molded and guided him on his journey, including his mom, who became the first female police officer in their home town of West Orange, New Jersey.  As ""civilians,"" we're fortunate to have this intimate glimpse into day-to-day life in space, and how the astronaut-adventurers come together to handle adversities, from space walk repairs to those dreaded phone calls from earth that something may be wrong with their loved ones back home. Endurance provides food for thought about our relationships with other nations and how precious our home planet truly is.  I had to carry a book of tape flags with me while reading this because I had to mark so many eye-opening passages that I didn't want to forget. I tortured my family with expositions and factoids that began, ""Listen to this, I read in Scott Kelly's book . . . ""  Without a doubt, you want to read this.  Many thanks to BookishFirst and Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group for the copy in exchange for my honest review. "
211,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33718320-samantha-colwell,3,"I received a copy of this book from Penguin Random House for an honest review.Scott Kelly's Endurance is a study in human achievement and the ISS is really the star of the show. Don't get me wrong--Scott Kelly is an interesting, personable, funny narrator, and his memoir is cohesive and strong. But the international space station, the way it functions and its purpose, is the most fascinating part of the novel. Endurance takes us in alternating chapters between episodes on the ISS and Kelly's life on earth: growing up with his twin brother, stressing in school over mediocre grades, the typical ""I wasn't great in school, but now I'm an astronaut"" thing. In spite of the fact that this book is about Kelly and his life, I found myself scanning through these chapters and moving onto the space station fodder. I loved learning about how the station works--how Kelly and cohorts eat in space, commit routine tasks, sleep on rotation, the politics of how human bodies endure. The progression of what man can achieve in space is so important to catalogue, and Kelly's memoir will go far in helping us understand the physical and mental toll a year in space can take. "
212,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19389289-paige,4,"It was difficult to put this memoir by former astronaut Scott Kelly down. This is the story of a living hero who comes across as approachable and relatable while also inspiring awe. I had limited background knowledge of the International Space Station or spaceflight, yet I was able to enjoy this book. This contained a fair amount of details and technical descriptions, but I never felt overwhelmed. What made this such an appealing read was that we never lose sight throughout that this is the personal story of an extraordinary man. And as remarkable as his accomplishments are, Scott Kelly the person does not get swallowed up by them. They are part of his experiences and he shares more than sugar coated versions. It was also fascinating to learn details about things including what it is like to prepare to launch into space, to command a space shuttle, and to live in space for a year. This book made me appreciate the space program, earth, and the tenacity of the human spirit."
213,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51021142-katie,5,"I wish I could give this book even more stars! I have read several other books written by astronauts about their time in space and Endurance is, by far, my favorite. The number of details included in this story makes it a very interesting read. Scott adds in many unique insights about his life on the iss, what led him to becoming an astronaut, what he was thinking or experiencing during different times and describing what the technical procedures are for. I highly recommend this book if you are interested in learning details about training, what astronauts experience during launch/reentry and what it is like to live in space."
214,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18904024-eugenia-hernandez,5,"I'm so happy to have come across this book. It's a real eye opener to read a true life experience of an Astronaut of our time. Scott Kelly has a lived a remarkable life. I found him to be surprisingly relatable. Contagious in spirit. Inspirational. Funny. A true soldier. Willing to risk his life for humanity. So grateful for all the Astronauts out there, and Russia for continuing to send people up to space. Definitely a must read!"

I think he has a lot to thank his ghostwriter for, as Kelly's voice comes through loud and clear. Fascinating life, amazing experiences. He strips away the ""glamour"" associated with astronauts, exposing instead the sheer hard work, professionalism, teamwork, pain and ingenuity required. A must read for anyone even slightly interested in what we are doing in space."

I enjoyed following Scott’s social media while he was in space so reading about his year in space and his memoirs about growing up and becoming an astronaut was a treat. I highly recommend. "

218,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32197772-joe-vigil,5,This is the best new book I've read all year! Cmdr Scott Kelly has written a real beautiful book. Anyone who has an interest in space and the ISS will not be able to put this one down. I know I couldn't!
219,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2048986-carrie-kellenberger,5,"Captain Scott Kelly has been on four flights to space and he is the US record holder for consecutive number of days spent in space. I don't know of any other person who has lived a life similar to his except for his identical twin brother Mark Kelly, who is also a fighter pilot, captain, and astronaut. Both brothers are also New York Times best-selling authors. I started my 2018 reading journey on two books: Endurance: A Year in Space, A Lifetime of Discovery by Scott Kelly and A Column of Fire by Ken Follett. I have been reading Scott Kelly's book at night and Ken Follett's book during the day. I happened to finish this one first and my oh my - 6 STARS. My hero has kept his hero status - not that I ever doubted Scott Kelly for a second. I've watched him rise in his career for years and followed his last space adventure with abnormal curiosity and utter fascination. Endurance: A Year in Space, A Lifetime of Discovery is a captivating memoir of Scott's journey to space and back to Earth. It also recounts his years of work towards becoming a fighter pilot and his formative years. I loved his writing style and his simple accounts of life in Russia while he was preparing for his flights to space as well as his accounts of life aboard the International Space Station. Time and time again, I was amazed at his observations and his perspectives on leadership, courage under pressure, and the importance of teamwork. Even after reading his book, it is hard for me to wrap my brain around some of the challenges he endured during his year in space and how he kept his cool. From the challenges of taking off and landing to isolation from everything and everyone he knows on Earth to the effects of space on the human body, there are just so many things in this book that made me pause and think. I loved his descriptions of how many types of aircrafts he learned to fly and the endless take offs and landings he performed in order to make his journey to space. I loved the descriptions of his camaraderie with the Russian Cosmonauts in ISS and I marvel at how two countries that were once at war are now co-existing in the same space in SPACE.I loved his compassion, his passion for life, and his sense of humor. I loved that he was able to describe his moments of unease and pain and push through them towards to horizon. There was so much I loved about this book, it is hard to put it all into a review. I've color-coded the whole book for passages I want to refer back to, but in all likelihood, I'll be writing a second review again once I've had a change to reread it. The only thing that really left me feeling dissatisfied with this book is that Captain Kelly doesn't address his issues with being back on Earth. The prologue mentions his pain, swelling and rashes, but the end of the book doesn't mention if these space symptoms have subsided or not. I have often wondered if I'd feel pain in space, and he answers my question thoroughly, but I'd like to know more about how he has done now that he has been back on Earth. Did his symptoms subside? Did they get worse? I guess I'll have to wait for his next book to find out. Either way, this one unanswered question was minuscule in comparison to all the other questions he answered about his year in space. Bravo, Astronaut Scott Kelly!Endurance: A Year in Space, A Lifetime of Discovery is a true testament to the strength of human will and resilience and the endless glory of imagination. Kelly has led a remarkable life, he wrote an incredible book, and the underlying message of hope: to never give up, to always persist at what you want - these are all takeaway lessons that I will remind myself of daily. Thank you, Captain Kelly, for your constant messages of hope and for your bravery and dedication to humanity. Best Takeaway Quotes from my first read: “I've learned that an achievement that seems to have been accomplished by one person probably has hundreds, maybe even thousands, of people's minds and work behind it, and I've learned that it's a privilege to be the embodiment of that work.”― Scott Kelly, Endurance: A Year in Space, A Lifetime of Discovery“What is it worth to see two former bitter enemies transform weapons into transport for exploration and the pursuit of scientific knowledge? What is it worth to see former enemy nations turn their warriors into crewmates and lifelong friends? This is impossible to put a dollar figure on, but to me it’s one of the things that makes this project worth the expense, even worth risking our lives.”― Scott Kelly, Endurance: A Year in Space, A Lifetime of DiscoveryI was up here as the only American with two Russian guys for six weeks this summer...and if something had happened to me, I would have counted on them for my life. We have a great relationship, and I think the international aspect of this program has been one of its highlights.― Scott Kelly, Endurance: A Year in Space, A Lifetime of DiscoveryYet the story of how we kept the space station cool - a huge chunk of metal flying through space getting roasted by the unfiltered sun for forty-five minutes out of every ninety while its enormous solar arrays generate electricity - is a story of engineering triumph with important implications for future space flight.― Scott Kelly, Endurance: A Year in Space, A Lifetime of Discovery"

At first I was relatively uninterested in the biographical aspects of the story, but as the book moved on I became more interested in Kelly and his life. I also enjoyed the glimpses of life aboard the space station. It certainly is not an easy life. "
221,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6904868-molly-mcinturff,5,"A fascinating memoir about Scott Kelly’s childhood, career as a US Navy fighter pilot and NASA astronaut, and his year-long mission at the International Space Station. I truly enjoyed it!"
222,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2526638-claudia-turner,5,"Scott Kelly is one of those rare individuals you meet only a few times in your life who has both a wild passionate soul and keen, calculating sense. He’s like Spock and Kirk rolled into one unforgettable space explorer. The title is fitting because throughout the book he cites the original “Endurance” about Shackleton’s exploration to Antarctica a century ago. Today we have the ISS and astronauts working against government apathy no to mention our understanding of time and space in order to reach into unknown regions of the universe and find if and how we’ll get to Mars. It all starts with a little grit and a lot of determination and Kelly (and his twin brother astronaut Mark Kelly) embody these traits. I’ve read quite a few astronaut and space books the last few years and one thing I’ve noticed is how difficult it is for many astronauts to maintain healthy marriages and relationships in general. There’s a lot of moving and traveling and being MIA for significant life events thats can strain the strongest of relationships. A lot of them didn’t come from cookie cutter backgrounds either and had to surpass life barriers that would break many a man. While everyone has their own perspective on their lives and the people that shaped them, Kelly does his best to understand and relate to the people he left behind even if it seems to fall short at times, like with his ex wife. Yet Kelly had one year at the ISS so a lot of time to really deconstruct his past, his place on earth, and how he got to where he is, and I love this soul searching, introspective type of writing. I also love his sense of humor and appreciation for minute details like with the flowers and toilet upon the ISS. Any great man/woman knows that greatness can’t exist without a lot of time given to all that appears trivial and inconsequential. All the little moments and the mundane aspects of life must be cared for and nurtured before “greatness” can be achieved. I appreciate Kelly’s thoughtfulness, his compassion, and most of all his adventurous spirit. He’s a true modern day explorer, a candid philosopher of sorts, and he would have made Shackleton proud."

Kimberly is even hosting a buddy read of it in July for her #greatspaceread!Endurance is one of those space memoirs that is mostly about the human condition and not about the science. I suck at science, but I LOVED this book and could not stop listening. At its core, this book is about a man’s willingness to go to almost any length to be a human lab rat for NASA to better understand space and our place within it.Kelly and his twin brother allowed their DNA to be used for research to help us figure out how to get to Mars. Scott lived on the ISS for a year while his twin stayed in Earth. But before all of that, Scott was your average teenager who didn’t know what to do with his life or how to take school serious. Then he read a book that gave him a clear goal, and he didn’t stop until he achieved that goal: flying a space shuttle.This book is full of jaw dropping moments. Moments you wouldn’t believe except, well, they did happen to Scott! I highly recommend this book to everyone and think we all can learn so much from Scott’s story.If you are looking for more on Scott and this year in space mission, there is a Netflix docuseries called....wait for it... A YEAR IN SPACE. But don’t watch it and hope to pass Kimberly’s Endurance test. She’ll know you cheated and didn’t read it."
224,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1384639-sandra,5,"As someone who has attended so many shuttle launches (one of which was Mr. Kelly’s flight in 1999) and landings and dreams of what its like to be in space, I was stoked to find out I was being given Endurance by Scott Kelly to review. I find outer space fascinating I follow the flight paths of the International Space Station (ISS)(which oddly enough will be crossing over my home at 6:22 p.m. tonight, and I am planning on watching it travel along on its journey with my high power binoculars). This book adds to my fascination. Retired Astronaut Scott Kelly is the longest occupying American resident of the ISS with 340 straight days in 2015-2016. Endurance is his memoir of that record-breaking stay and the rest of his “Lifetime of Discovery.” Selected to a ""year-long mission"" starting with Expedition 43, he then commanded Expedition 44 and 45, Mr. Kelly had put into practice what it was like to live on the Space Station two years before with his 5 months stay on the ISS during Expedition 26. His life journey through hardships in his childhood, his service in the Navy as a Pilot, fighting Prostate Cancer and those months of Expedition 43 prepared him for what came next. Endurance is the closest I will ever get to space and I ate up every word Mr. Kelly wrote. His struggles from being away from his family, his relationships, his joys, his mental and physical health, working with various countries Astronauts delving in Biomedical Engineering, his vivid explanations of the day to day jobs he completed were like a sci-fi novel turned reality. Can you imagine what it would be like to look at the earth and see it in all its glory, it’s distinguishing attributes? You don’t have to, Mr. Kelly gives you his view and feelings on what it is like. He makes you feel as if you are there, working, playing and traveling through zero gravity. The knowledge that you don’t have control over anything that happens on earth to your family is something that Mr. Kelly finds out about when his sister-in-law Congresswoman Gabriella Giffords is shot in Arizona at a Safeway grocery store parking lot meeting with constituents. Mr. Kelly had a few months left of his stay. A few things of what Mr. Kelly says of that experience, while leading the nation in a moment of silence concerning the horrific assassination attempt and deaths of six people and 13 injured that day in Tucson struck me as something to really chew on and change, and also some huge foreshadowing, “Those of us who have had the privilege to look down on the Earth from space get the chance to take a larger perspective of the planet and the people who share it. I feel more strongly than ever that we must do better” He explains after the moment of silence ""on the space station, we followed our normal routine. But I knew that on Earth somethings would never be the same.” Mr. Kelly’s life experiences told throughout this book show everyone that someone can come from obscurity and land into whatever they dream of becoming and beyond those dreams. This book is worth reading especially if you have any inkling of journeying from your own life to someone else’s and obviously if you love space exploration. This book hits one of my top five memoirs. Read it, you won’t regret it. Thanks to Bookish First for sending me a copy of Endurance: A Year in Space, A lifetime of Discovery I thoroughly enjoyed it. This book was given to me in lieu of my honest opinion."
225,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12691311-debbie,5,"I liked this book a lot! It was very interesting and held my interest throughout. Scott Kelly is a very funny guy and I liked how put that into the book. I learned a lot about the space industry. Most of it, I didn’t know. I certainly didn’t realize that there are still astronauts and that we are using Russia’s facilities. I now a little secret about dill, as well. Ha!! I think it’s great that we are cooperating with Russia in order to learn more about space and the secrets it holds. So many different things that I learned about were very extraordinary. A really good book that I enjoyed very much. Thanks to Bookish for providing me with a free copy of the book (a hard copy) in order for me to review."
226,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4474787-mimi,4,"Not only is the title a nod to Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage and it is interwoven in Kelly's time on the space station, but the reason that Scott goes into NASA is Tom Wolfe's The Right Stuff. I loved that reading was so integral to this story and loved Kelly's voice, history, and observations. It could have been a dry tome and was pleasantly live. "
227,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12765668-linda,4,"Capt. Scott Kelly, USN, a US astronaut extraordinaire, tells the compelling story of his life’s journey from a modest and underachieving childhood, to reading a book that changed his life, to becoming a Navy test pilot, then being accepted, along with his twin brother Mark, into the space program, and eventually taking up residence on the International Space Station for a full year. What an amazing adventure story! Scott isn’t a professional writer, and he had someone (Margaret Lazarus Dean) co-write with him, but Endurance felt like Scott told it his way, showing his faults as well as his triumphs, and teaching his readers enough about space travel to feel like we were almost along for the ride with him. I liked it a lot, scientific jargon notwithstanding."
228,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1432957-alison,5,"I’ll never go to space, but this book is a great replacement. Kelly’s account of his career and year in space captivated me. His writing is sometimes conversational, sometimes polished and poetic. His reflections on life after a year at the International Space Station are worth returning to again and again. I have a new respect for what it takes—mentally, physically, emotionally—to be an astronaut. I’ll be recommending this one for a while. “I’ve learned that an achievement that seems to have been accomplished by one person probably has hundreds, maybe even thousands, of people’s minds and work behind it, and I’ve learned that it’s a privilege to be the embodiment of that work.”"

From being 18 and captivated by Tom Wolfe’s The Right Stuff, to setting lofty, personal academic and professional goals, Scott Kelly proves that you can do “hard things” when you set your mind to it. Great book!"

He has a very relaxed, witty style of writing and I enjoyed the jokes thrown in. It also wasn't so technical that you couldn't understand what he was talking about on the ISS. Highly recommend!"
232,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67612372-megan,3,"Oh my god, astronauts are so much braver than I thought.You know–everyone knows–deep down, that astronauts are a little bit crazy. They voluntarily launch themselves away from Earth at the speed of sound on top of a rocket that might be a bomb if it’s not regulated or cooled properly or if a tiny bolt is out of place, so that they can go explore what happens to people in a place that is passively trying to kill them at all times. Scott Kelly and his Russian counterpart, Misha Kornienko, lived up there for a year. In an environment that was gravity-less, water-less, air-less…people-less. The maximum number of people who were on the International Space Station while the two of them were completing their year in space was nine. Nine people to substitute the entire human race.Kelly’s anecdotes about the life on the ISS are brutally real, but told in such a matter-of-fact way that you almost forget the dangers. He reminds you, of course, that something as simple as fixing the toilet is a project of vital importance and that if a single bolt or screw goes floating off into the depths of the station, it might be lost forever. But it’s also funny to think about someone having the fix the toilet that’s in space. Kelly doesn’t shy away from these bits of humor, and even finds ways to make the tales of life-and-death zero-g shenanigans lighthearted and interesting. But there’s an underlying intensity that feels sort of like what I imagine living in space might feel like: you have to laugh at the monstrous vacuum trying to kill you, otherwise it will be too overwhelming to continue.Interspersed with tales from the ISS are chapters of how Scott Kelly became an astronaut. It was a long journey for him, from terrible student to Navy test pilot to various NASA jobs–space shuttle pilot, astronaut liaison with the Russian space agency, and finally long-flight mission astronaut. It’s quite a wild ride with various colorful characters and it shows a great resilience in Kelly, a perseverance and a determination that are incredibly important qualities in an astronaut.This book was very accessible–all of the hard science was explained in terms simple enough that even the most English-major-y of nerds (me) could understand. There were some technical bits that were a bit dense, but it was well worth reading through them to understand just how difficult rocket science really is. Or…space station science, I suppose. Anyone who read and enjoyed Andy Weir’s The Martian will probably like this book for similar reasons–fascinating scientific and technological explanations interspersed with a quiet sense of humor and personal journey narrative that disperses the intensity of the situation, but doesn’t detract from it.I highly recommend this book for lovers of space, for anyone who grew up looking at the stars and wishing they could walk among them. Reading Endurance is a little bit like living vicariously through Scott Kelly–maybe you’re the not one going on spacewalks and floating over to the Russian module for Friday dinners, but the sense of wonder and kinship between humanity and the starts is closer and more real. It’s a fascinating look at life in space and what it takes to get there–determination, a good sense of humor, an unparalleled strength, bravery, and…well, endurance."
233,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33105402-tyson,5,"“There's a starman waiting in the skyHe'd like to come and meet usBut he thinks he'd blow our mindsThere's a starman waiting in the skyHe's told us not to blow itCause he knows it's all worthwhile”Scott Kelly defines hard work in his career path to becoming an astronaut. His book does every justice to explain how he reached a point in his life where he become one of the only human beings to have the privilege to spend an entire year in outer space. His writing is enough to make even a person with minimal interest in space exploration envious of his opportunity.This was Kelly’s first book, which is not surprising because he seems to have been rather busy in the years preceding it. He worked hard to overcome obstacles, both personal and professional. For the most part, he seems like a no-nonsense kind of guy, a man who understands that in order to reach goals, much of it is the perseverance to help yourself. It is a quality that holds high importance in space, where there is nobody to hold your hand and resolve issues for you. Kelly’s attitude is not only symbolic but a literal protocol in his journey through 340 days spent on the International Space Station.Anybody can write a book about what they do. Whether it is a politician or a professional ball player, autobiographies have the capability to let us into the minds and lives of people who live in ways most of us probably won’t ever experience. But Kelly’s book is different. It is harder to wrap your head around, a grossly more monumental production because of all it entails. He leaves the planet, lives primarily on his own, and is responsible for things that we, as gravity-stuck humans, only know nature for taking care of (like providing air to breathe or keeping our food on our plates). Things we don’t blink an eye at, he faced as trials and tribulations, inhibitions to simple tasks like eating, moving, sleeping, and basic life functions.Please take the time to read this book. Please find Kelly’s social media accounts (Instagram most importantly) and follow along. Kelly, who had to learn how to do so many things to further his career, his personal life, and his days in space, has seemed to naturally add another to his list when he wrote this autobiography. It is a wonderful addition to the adventurous genre of travel."

Intensely interesting if you've ever wondered how the International Space Station functions. Lots of insights about the actual science of space travel with an emphasis on the hardships and how they apply to traveling to Mars. This book will make you watch all your favorite sci/fi films and read all your sci/fi books in a new light. Space is scary. Real scary. 
235,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6014143-dena,3,I really liked Scott Kelly's memoir. I have no desire myself to push the boundaries of space and his ability to share the joys as well as the hardships of it was fascinating. This is real space.

239,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1976637-jeff,4,"If my Wisconsin math is correct, this is my sixth astronaut memoir /biography/ autobiography and I'd rank it in that collection behind only the Sally Ride and Mike Massimino books. Scott Kelly is the American astronaut selected to spend a year in space aboard the ISS and this is his story of that experience. Actually, the book jumps back and forth between long mission on the ISS and the backstory of how he got there. I found both to be interesting, however, I was much more intrigued by his experiences in space. I listened to Endurance in audio. Scott's narration was straight ahead and usually without emotion or much inflection, unlike the book self-narrated by astronaut Mike Massimino who is a natural storyteller and hilarious. Still, Scott was a competent storyteller and had a knack for explaining the technical aspects of his life, and did throw some humor in here and there. He named his book Endurance after Shackleton's ship which was destroyed in his ill-fated journey to the South Pole. He brought Shackleton's book to space in order to remind himself that no matter how hard life became in space was it wasn't as bad as what Shackleton's expedition went through. The times he spent in space including the travel to and from space, were fascinating and covered not only his year-long stint on the ISS, but is first six-month ISS mission as well has his space shuttle missions and trips on the Soyuz. He does a nice job documenting his unique experiences in a relatable way. Scott and his Russian counterpart (who also spent a year on the ISS) were pushed to the physical limits living in zero G for so long and pushed to the mental limits knowing that they were away from friends and loved ones (and the whole damn Earth!) for a year. Scott said several times his biggest fear was that something bad would happen to one of his family members while he was in space as there would be nothing he could do to help. Sure enough, his sister-in-law congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords of AZ was shot in the head during a public appearance in Tucson. All he could do was watch the TV coverage from space. Some of the most interesting parts of the book for me were his comparisons of the Russian and American space agencies. Surprisingly, they both had very different sets of rules and philosophies, not to mention the differences between the Soyuz and the now-retired Space Shuttles. Some of his terrestrial stories were less interesting, like the unraveling of his marriage and troubles with his daughters. One of the unique things about Scott's time in space was that his identical twin, Mark, was on earth and was Scott's experimental control for the tests about the long term effects of living in space on Scott's body. Their almost identical physiology and DNA could be compared. The book ends shortly after Scott returns to earth so the results of these experiments were not included in the book. I guess that's what Google is for. One of Scott's final comments was an echo of the messages I've heard from other astronauts: from space the Earth appears to be an oasis in an infinite backdrop of stars and other galaxies, all too far to reach, so we humans need to get our act together and treat it as the special place it is. There is no plan B. "
240,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3030161-ericka-seidemann,5,"Wow. Just, wow.  This memoir is a page-turner from start to finish, and I appreciated that it wasn't structured chronologically, but rather followed Kelly's storytelling with flashbacks and flashforwards to create a riveting narrative.  Endurance is not just about Kelly's time on the ISS, but also delves into the training that led up to his becoming an astronaut. All of Kelly's experiences, from his time as an EMT on an ambulance to his career in the military flying fighter jets, contributed to his skill of calm focus in the face of extremes necessary to command the ISS. He also gives credit to those who molded and guided him on his journey, including his mom, who became the first female police officer in their home town of West Orange, New Jersey.  As ""civilians,"" we're fortunate to have this intimate glimpse into day-to-day life in space, and how the astronaut-adventurers come together to handle adversities, from space walk repairs to those dreaded phone calls from earth that something may be wrong with their loved ones back home. Endurance provides food for thought about our relationships with other nations and how precious our home planet truly is.  I had to carry a book of tape flags with me while reading this because I had to mark so many eye-opening passages that I didn't want to forget. I tortured my family with expositions and factoids that began, ""Listen to this, I read in Scott Kelly's book . . . ""  Without a doubt, you want to read this.  Many thanks to BookishFirst and Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group for the copy in exchange for my honest review. "
241,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33718320-samantha-colwell,3,"I received a copy of this book from Penguin Random House for an honest review.Scott Kelly's Endurance is a study in human achievement and the ISS is really the star of the show. Don't get me wrong--Scott Kelly is an interesting, personable, funny narrator, and his memoir is cohesive and strong. But the international space station, the way it functions and its purpose, is the most fascinating part of the novel. Endurance takes us in alternating chapters between episodes on the ISS and Kelly's life on earth: growing up with his twin brother, stressing in school over mediocre grades, the typical ""I wasn't great in school, but now I'm an astronaut"" thing. In spite of the fact that this book is about Kelly and his life, I found myself scanning through these chapters and moving onto the space station fodder. I loved learning about how the station works--how Kelly and cohorts eat in space, commit routine tasks, sleep on rotation, the politics of how human bodies endure. The progression of what man can achieve in space is so important to catalogue, and Kelly's memoir will go far in helping us understand the physical and mental toll a year in space can take. "
242,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19389289-paige,4,"It was difficult to put this memoir by former astronaut Scott Kelly down. This is the story of a living hero who comes across as approachable and relatable while also inspiring awe. I had limited background knowledge of the International Space Station or spaceflight, yet I was able to enjoy this book. This contained a fair amount of details and technical descriptions, but I never felt overwhelmed. What made this such an appealing read was that we never lose sight throughout that this is the personal story of an extraordinary man. And as remarkable as his accomplishments are, Scott Kelly the person does not get swallowed up by them. They are part of his experiences and he shares more than sugar coated versions. It was also fascinating to learn details about things including what it is like to prepare to launch into space, to command a space shuttle, and to live in space for a year. This book made me appreciate the space program, earth, and the tenacity of the human spirit."

I have read several other books written by astronauts about their time in space and Endurance is, by far, my favorite. The number of details included in this story makes it a very interesting read. Scott adds in many unique insights about his life on the iss, what led him to becoming an astronaut, what he was thinking or experiencing during different times and describing what the technical procedures are for. I highly recommend this book if you are interested in learning details about training, what astronauts experience during launch/reentry and what it is like to live in space."
244,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18904024-eugenia-hernandez,5,"I'm so happy to have come across this book. It's a real eye opener to read a true life experience of an Astronaut of our time. Scott Kelly has a lived a remarkable life. I found him to be surprisingly relatable. Contagious in spirit. Inspirational. Funny. A true soldier. Willing to risk his life for humanity. So grateful for all the Astronauts out there, and Russia for continuing to send people up to space. Definitely a must read!"
245,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3530176-alex-rogers,5,"Who doesn't love a good astronaut bio? But Kelly does it really well, and comes across as a very interesting, genuine human being. I think he has a lot to thank his ghostwriter for, as Kelly's voice comes through loud and clear. Fascinating life, amazing experiences. He strips away the ""glamour"" associated with astronauts, exposing instead the sheer hard work, professionalism, teamwork, pain and ingenuity required. A must read for anyone even slightly interested in what we are doing in space."

I enjoyed following Scott’s social media while he was in space so reading about his year in space and his memoirs about growing up and becoming an astronaut was a treat. I highly recommend. "
247,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53275004-lilly-mary,5,"That was a f*#king amazing read! Go out, buy it, loan it, download it... what ever you have to do and then set aside everything, including sleep, because you will not be able to stop reading! Scott Kelly - you are incredible! "
248,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32197772-joe-vigil,5,This is the best new book I've read all year! Cmdr Scott Kelly has written a real beautiful book. Anyone who has an interest in space and the ISS will not be able to put this one down. I know I couldn't!
249,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2048986-carrie-kellenberger,5,"Captain Scott Kelly has been on four flights to space and he is the US record holder for consecutive number of days spent in space. I don't know of any other person who has lived a life similar to his except for his identical twin brother Mark Kelly, who is also a fighter pilot, captain, and astronaut. Both brothers are also New York Times best-selling authors. I started my 2018 reading journey on two books: Endurance: A Year in Space, A Lifetime of Discovery by Scott Kelly and A Column of Fire by Ken Follett. I have been reading Scott Kelly's book at night and Ken Follett's book during the day. I happened to finish this one first and my oh my - 6 STARS. My hero has kept his hero status - not that I ever doubted Scott Kelly for a second. I've watched him rise in his career for years and followed his last space adventure with abnormal curiosity and utter fascination. Endurance: A Year in Space, A Lifetime of Discovery is a captivating memoir of Scott's journey to space and back to Earth. It also recounts his years of work towards becoming a fighter pilot and his formative years. I loved his writing style and his simple accounts of life in Russia while he was preparing for his flights to space as well as his accounts of life aboard the International Space Station. Time and time again, I was amazed at his observations and his perspectives on leadership, courage under pressure, and the importance of teamwork. Even after reading his book, it is hard for me to wrap my brain around some of the challenges he endured during his year in space and how he kept his cool. From the challenges of taking off and landing to isolation from everything and everyone he knows on Earth to the effects of space on the human body, there are just so many things in this book that made me pause and think. I loved his descriptions of how many types of aircrafts he learned to fly and the endless take offs and landings he performed in order to make his journey to space. I loved the descriptions of his camaraderie with the Russian Cosmonauts in ISS and I marvel at how two countries that were once at war are now co-existing in the same space in SPACE.I loved his compassion, his passion for life, and his sense of humor. I loved that he was able to describe his moments of unease and pain and push through them towards to horizon. There was so much I loved about this book, it is hard to put it all into a review. I've color-coded the whole book for passages I want to refer back to, but in all likelihood, I'll be writing a second review again once I've had a change to reread it. The only thing that really left me feeling dissatisfied with this book is that Captain Kelly doesn't address his issues with being back on Earth. The prologue mentions his pain, swelling and rashes, but the end of the book doesn't mention if these space symptoms have subsided or not. I have often wondered if I'd feel pain in space, and he answers my question thoroughly, but I'd like to know more about how he has done now that he has been back on Earth. Did his symptoms subside? Did they get worse? I guess I'll have to wait for his next book to find out. Either way, this one unanswered question was minuscule in comparison to all the other questions he answered about his year in space. Bravo, Astronaut Scott Kelly!Endurance: A Year in Space, A Lifetime of Discovery is a true testament to the strength of human will and resilience and the endless glory of imagination. Kelly has led a remarkable life, he wrote an incredible book, and the underlying message of hope: to never give up, to always persist at what you want - these are all takeaway lessons that I will remind myself of daily. Thank you, Captain Kelly, for your constant messages of hope and for your bravery and dedication to humanity. Best Takeaway Quotes from my first read: “I've learned that an achievement that seems to have been accomplished by one person probably has hundreds, maybe even thousands, of people's minds and work behind it, and I've learned that it's a privilege to be the embodiment of that work.”― Scott Kelly, Endurance: A Year in Space, A Lifetime of Discovery“What is it worth to see two former bitter enemies transform weapons into transport for exploration and the pursuit of scientific knowledge? What is it worth to see former enemy nations turn their warriors into crewmates and lifelong friends? This is impossible to put a dollar figure on, but to me it’s one of the things that makes this project worth the expense, even worth risking our lives.”― Scott Kelly, Endurance: A Year in Space, A Lifetime of DiscoveryI was up here as the only American with two Russian guys for six weeks this summer...and if something had happened to me, I would have counted on them for my life. We have a great relationship, and I think the international aspect of this program has been one of its highlights.― Scott Kelly, Endurance: A Year in Space, A Lifetime of DiscoveryYet the story of how we kept the space station cool - a huge chunk of metal flying through space getting roasted by the unfiltered sun for forty-five minutes out of every ninety while its enormous solar arrays generate electricity - is a story of engineering triumph with important implications for future space flight.― Scott Kelly, Endurance: A Year in Space, A Lifetime of Discovery"

At first I was relatively uninterested in the biographical aspects of the story, but as the book moved on I became more interested in Kelly and his life. I also enjoyed the glimpses of life aboard the space station. It certainly is not an easy life. "
251,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6904868-molly-mcinturff,5,"A fascinating memoir about Scott Kelly’s childhood, career as a US Navy fighter pilot and NASA astronaut, and his year-long mission at the International Space Station. I truly enjoyed it!"
252,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2526638-claudia-turner,5,"Scott Kelly is one of those rare individuals you meet only a few times in your life who has both a wild passionate soul and keen, calculating sense. He’s like Spock and Kirk rolled into one unforgettable space explorer. The title is fitting because throughout the book he cites the original “Endurance” about Shackleton’s exploration to Antarctica a century ago. Today we have the ISS and astronauts working against government apathy no to mention our understanding of time and space in order to reach into unknown regions of the universe and find if and how we’ll get to Mars. It all starts with a little grit and a lot of determination and Kelly (and his twin brother astronaut Mark Kelly) embody these traits. I’ve read quite a few astronaut and space books the last few years and one thing I’ve noticed is how difficult it is for many astronauts to maintain healthy marriages and relationships in general. There’s a lot of moving and traveling and being MIA for significant life events thats can strain the strongest of relationships. A lot of them didn’t come from cookie cutter backgrounds either and had to surpass life barriers that would break many a man. While everyone has their own perspective on their lives and the people that shaped them, Kelly does his best to understand and relate to the people he left behind even if it seems to fall short at times, like with his ex wife. Yet Kelly had one year at the ISS so a lot of time to really deconstruct his past, his place on earth, and how he got to where he is, and I love this soul searching, introspective type of writing. I also love his sense of humor and appreciation for minute details like with the flowers and toilet upon the ISS. Any great man/woman knows that greatness can’t exist without a lot of time given to all that appears trivial and inconsequential. All the little moments and the mundane aspects of life must be cared for and nurtured before “greatness” can be achieved. I appreciate Kelly’s thoughtfulness, his compassion, and most of all his adventurous spirit. He’s a true modern day explorer, a candid philosopher of sorts, and he would have made Shackleton proud."

Kimberly is even hosting a buddy read of it in July for her #greatspaceread!Endurance is one of those space memoirs that is mostly about the human condition and not about the science. I suck at science, but I LOVED this book and could not stop listening. At its core, this book is about a man’s willingness to go to almost any length to be a human lab rat for NASA to better understand space and our place within it.Kelly and his twin brother allowed their DNA to be used for research to help us figure out how to get to Mars. Scott lived on the ISS for a year while his twin stayed in Earth. But before all of that, Scott was your average teenager who didn’t know what to do with his life or how to take school serious. Then he read a book that gave him a clear goal, and he didn’t stop until he achieved that goal: flying a space shuttle.This book is full of jaw dropping moments. Moments you wouldn’t believe except, well, they did happen to Scott! I highly recommend this book to everyone and think we all can learn so much from Scott’s story.If you are looking for more on Scott and this year in space mission, there is a Netflix docuseries called....wait for it... A YEAR IN SPACE. But don’t watch it and hope to pass Kimberly’s Endurance test. She’ll know you cheated and didn’t read it."
254,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1384639-sandra,5,"As someone who has attended so many shuttle launches (one of which was Mr. Kelly’s flight in 1999) and landings and dreams of what its like to be in space, I was stoked to find out I was being given Endurance by Scott Kelly to review. I find outer space fascinating I follow the flight paths of the International Space Station (ISS)(which oddly enough will be crossing over my home at 6:22 p.m. tonight, and I am planning on watching it travel along on its journey with my high power binoculars). This book adds to my fascination. Retired Astronaut Scott Kelly is the longest occupying American resident of the ISS with 340 straight days in 2015-2016. Endurance is his memoir of that record-breaking stay and the rest of his “Lifetime of Discovery.” Selected to a ""year-long mission"" starting with Expedition 43, he then commanded Expedition 44 and 45, Mr. Kelly had put into practice what it was like to live on the Space Station two years before with his 5 months stay on the ISS during Expedition 26. His life journey through hardships in his childhood, his service in the Navy as a Pilot, fighting Prostate Cancer and those months of Expedition 43 prepared him for what came next. Endurance is the closest I will ever get to space and I ate up every word Mr. Kelly wrote. His struggles from being away from his family, his relationships, his joys, his mental and physical health, working with various countries Astronauts delving in Biomedical Engineering, his vivid explanations of the day to day jobs he completed were like a sci-fi novel turned reality. Can you imagine what it would be like to look at the earth and see it in all its glory, it’s distinguishing attributes? You don’t have to, Mr. Kelly gives you his view and feelings on what it is like. He makes you feel as if you are there, working, playing and traveling through zero gravity. The knowledge that you don’t have control over anything that happens on earth to your family is something that Mr. Kelly finds out about when his sister-in-law Congresswoman Gabriella Giffords is shot in Arizona at a Safeway grocery store parking lot meeting with constituents. Mr. Kelly had a few months left of his stay. A few things of what Mr. Kelly says of that experience, while leading the nation in a moment of silence concerning the horrific assassination attempt and deaths of six people and 13 injured that day in Tucson struck me as something to really chew on and change, and also some huge foreshadowing, “Those of us who have had the privilege to look down on the Earth from space get the chance to take a larger perspective of the planet and the people who share it. I feel more strongly than ever that we must do better” He explains after the moment of silence ""on the space station, we followed our normal routine. But I knew that on Earth somethings would never be the same.” Mr. Kelly’s life experiences told throughout this book show everyone that someone can come from obscurity and land into whatever they dream of becoming and beyond those dreams. This book is worth reading especially if you have any inkling of journeying from your own life to someone else’s and obviously if you love space exploration. This book hits one of my top five memoirs. Read it, you won’t regret it. Thanks to Bookish First for sending me a copy of Endurance: A Year in Space, A lifetime of Discovery I thoroughly enjoyed it. This book was given to me in lieu of my honest opinion."
255,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12691311-debbie,5,"I liked this book a lot! It was very interesting and held my interest throughout. Scott Kelly is a very funny guy and I liked how put that into the book. I learned a lot about the space industry. Most of it, I didn’t know. I certainly didn’t realize that there are still astronauts and that we are using Russia’s facilities. I now a little secret about dill, as well. Ha!! I think it’s great that we are cooperating with Russia in order to learn more about space and the secrets it holds. So many different things that I learned about were very extraordinary. A really good book that I enjoyed very much. Thanks to Bookish for providing me with a free copy of the book (a hard copy) in order for me to review."
256,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4474787-mimi,4,"Not only is the title a nod to Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage and it is interwoven in Kelly's time on the space station, but the reason that Scott goes into NASA is Tom Wolfe's The Right Stuff. I loved that reading was so integral to this story and loved Kelly's voice, history, and observations. It could have been a dry tome and was pleasantly live. "
257,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12765668-linda,4,"Capt. Scott Kelly, USN, a US astronaut extraordinaire, tells the compelling story of his life’s journey from a modest and underachieving childhood, to reading a book that changed his life, to becoming a Navy test pilot, then being accepted, along with his twin brother Mark, into the space program, and eventually taking up residence on the International Space Station for a full year. What an amazing adventure story! Scott isn’t a professional writer, and he had someone (Margaret Lazarus Dean) co-write with him, but Endurance felt like Scott told it his way, showing his faults as well as his triumphs, and teaching his readers enough about space travel to feel like we were almost along for the ride with him. I liked it a lot, scientific jargon notwithstanding."
258,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1432957-alison,5,"I’ll never go to space, but this book is a great replacement. Kelly’s account of his career and year in space captivated me. His writing is sometimes conversational, sometimes polished and poetic. His reflections on life after a year at the International Space Station are worth returning to again and again. I have a new respect for what it takes—mentally, physically, emotionally—to be an astronaut. I’ll be recommending this one for a while. “I’ve learned that an achievement that seems to have been accomplished by one person probably has hundreds, maybe even thousands, of people’s minds and work behind it, and I’ve learned that it’s a privilege to be the embodiment of that work.”"

From being 18 and captivated by Tom Wolfe’s The Right Stuff, to setting lofty, personal academic and professional goals, Scott Kelly proves that you can do “hard things” when you set your mind to it. Great book!"
260,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6005592-elena,2,Wasn't a masterpiece. I had to skip a lot and got really bored toward the end. It could have worked better if someone else had written it.

He has a very relaxed, witty style of writing and I enjoyed the jokes thrown in. It also wasn't so technical that you couldn't understand what he was talking about on the ISS. Highly recommend!"
262,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67612372-megan,3,"Oh my god, astronauts are so much braver than I thought.You know–everyone knows–deep down, that astronauts are a little bit crazy. They voluntarily launch themselves away from Earth at the speed of sound on top of a rocket that might be a bomb if it’s not regulated or cooled properly or if a tiny bolt is out of place, so that they can go explore what happens to people in a place that is passively trying to kill them at all times. Scott Kelly and his Russian counterpart, Misha Kornienko, lived up there for a year. In an environment that was gravity-less, water-less, air-less…people-less. The maximum number of people who were on the International Space Station while the two of them were completing their year in space was nine. Nine people to substitute the entire human race.Kelly’s anecdotes about the life on the ISS are brutally real, but told in such a matter-of-fact way that you almost forget the dangers. He reminds you, of course, that something as simple as fixing the toilet is a project of vital importance and that if a single bolt or screw goes floating off into the depths of the station, it might be lost forever. But it’s also funny to think about someone having the fix the toilet that’s in space. Kelly doesn’t shy away from these bits of humor, and even finds ways to make the tales of life-and-death zero-g shenanigans lighthearted and interesting. But there’s an underlying intensity that feels sort of like what I imagine living in space might feel like: you have to laugh at the monstrous vacuum trying to kill you, otherwise it will be too overwhelming to continue.Interspersed with tales from the ISS are chapters of how Scott Kelly became an astronaut. It was a long journey for him, from terrible student to Navy test pilot to various NASA jobs–space shuttle pilot, astronaut liaison with the Russian space agency, and finally long-flight mission astronaut. It’s quite a wild ride with various colorful characters and it shows a great resilience in Kelly, a perseverance and a determination that are incredibly important qualities in an astronaut.This book was very accessible–all of the hard science was explained in terms simple enough that even the most English-major-y of nerds (me) could understand. There were some technical bits that were a bit dense, but it was well worth reading through them to understand just how difficult rocket science really is. Or…space station science, I suppose. Anyone who read and enjoyed Andy Weir’s The Martian will probably like this book for similar reasons–fascinating scientific and technological explanations interspersed with a quiet sense of humor and personal journey narrative that disperses the intensity of the situation, but doesn’t detract from it.I highly recommend this book for lovers of space, for anyone who grew up looking at the stars and wishing they could walk among them. Reading Endurance is a little bit like living vicariously through Scott Kelly–maybe you’re the not one going on spacewalks and floating over to the Russian module for Friday dinners, but the sense of wonder and kinship between humanity and the starts is closer and more real. It’s a fascinating look at life in space and what it takes to get there–determination, a good sense of humor, an unparalleled strength, bravery, and…well, endurance."
263,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33105402-tyson,5,"“There's a starman waiting in the skyHe'd like to come and meet usBut he thinks he'd blow our mindsThere's a starman waiting in the skyHe's told us not to blow itCause he knows it's all worthwhile”Scott Kelly defines hard work in his career path to becoming an astronaut. His book does every justice to explain how he reached a point in his life where he become one of the only human beings to have the privilege to spend an entire year in outer space. His writing is enough to make even a person with minimal interest in space exploration envious of his opportunity.This was Kelly’s first book, which is not surprising because he seems to have been rather busy in the years preceding it. He worked hard to overcome obstacles, both personal and professional. For the most part, he seems like a no-nonsense kind of guy, a man who understands that in order to reach goals, much of it is the perseverance to help yourself. It is a quality that holds high importance in space, where there is nobody to hold your hand and resolve issues for you. Kelly’s attitude is not only symbolic but a literal protocol in his journey through 340 days spent on the International Space Station.Anybody can write a book about what they do. Whether it is a politician or a professional ball player, autobiographies have the capability to let us into the minds and lives of people who live in ways most of us probably won’t ever experience. But Kelly’s book is different. It is harder to wrap your head around, a grossly more monumental production because of all it entails. He leaves the planet, lives primarily on his own, and is responsible for things that we, as gravity-stuck humans, only know nature for taking care of (like providing air to breathe or keeping our food on our plates). Things we don’t blink an eye at, he faced as trials and tribulations, inhibitions to simple tasks like eating, moving, sleeping, and basic life functions.Please take the time to read this book. Please find Kelly’s social media accounts (Instagram most importantly) and follow along. Kelly, who had to learn how to do so many things to further his career, his personal life, and his days in space, has seemed to naturally add another to his list when he wrote this autobiography. It is a wonderful addition to the adventurous genre of travel."
264,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27943513-brian-mccue,4,A brief biography of Scott Kelly's life and his recent year-long stay in the ISS. Intensely interesting if you've ever wondered how the International Space Station functions. Lots of insights about the actual science of space travel with an emphasis on the hardships and how they apply to traveling to Mars. This book will make you watch all your favorite sci/fi films and read all your sci/fi books in a new light. Space is scary. Real scary. 
265,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6014143-dena,3,I really liked Scott Kelly's memoir. I have no desire myself to push the boundaries of space and his ability to share the joys as well as the hardships of it was fascinating. This is real space. Not sci-fi or Diet Space and certainly not for the claustrophobic or weak of stomach. Off to stalk Kelly's IG account.

269,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1976637-jeff,4,"If my Wisconsin math is correct, this is my sixth astronaut memoir /biography/ autobiography and I'd rank it in that collection behind only the Sally Ride and Mike Massimino books. Scott Kelly is the American astronaut selected to spend a year in space aboard the ISS and this is his story of that experience. Actually, the book jumps back and forth between long mission on the ISS and the backstory of how he got there. I found both to be interesting, however, I was much more intrigued by his experiences in space. I listened to Endurance in audio. Scott's narration was straight ahead and usually without emotion or much inflection, unlike the book self-narrated by astronaut Mike Massimino who is a natural storyteller and hilarious. Still, Scott was a competent storyteller and had a knack for explaining the technical aspects of his life, and did throw some humor in here and there. He named his book Endurance after Shackleton's ship which was destroyed in his ill-fated journey to the South Pole. He brought Shackleton's book to space in order to remind himself that no matter how hard life became in space was it wasn't as bad as what Shackleton's expedition went through. The times he spent in space including the travel to and from space, were fascinating and covered not only his year-long stint on the ISS, but is first six-month ISS mission as well has his space shuttle missions and trips on the Soyuz. He does a nice job documenting his unique experiences in a relatable way. Scott and his Russian counterpart (who also spent a year on the ISS) were pushed to the physical limits living in zero G for so long and pushed to the mental limits knowing that they were away from friends and loved ones (and the whole damn Earth!) for a year. Scott said several times his biggest fear was that something bad would happen to one of his family members while he was in space as there would be nothing he could do to help. Sure enough, his sister-in-law congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords of AZ was shot in the head during a public appearance in Tucson. All he could do was watch the TV coverage from space. Some of the most interesting parts of the book for me were his comparisons of the Russian and American space agencies. Surprisingly, they both had very different sets of rules and philosophies, not to mention the differences between the Soyuz and the now-retired Space Shuttles. Some of his terrestrial stories were less interesting, like the unraveling of his marriage and troubles with his daughters. One of the unique things about Scott's time in space was that his identical twin, Mark, was on earth and was Scott's experimental control for the tests about the long term effects of living in space on Scott's body. Their almost identical physiology and DNA could be compared. The book ends shortly after Scott returns to earth so the results of these experiments were not included in the book. I guess that's what Google is for. One of Scott's final comments was an echo of the messages I've heard from other astronauts: from space the Earth appears to be an oasis in an infinite backdrop of stars and other galaxies, all too far to reach, so we humans need to get our act together and treat it as the special place it is. There is no plan B. "
270,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3030161-ericka-seidemann,5,"Wow. Just, wow.  This memoir is a page-turner from start to finish, and I appreciated that it wasn't structured chronologically, but rather followed Kelly's storytelling with flashbacks and flashforwards to create a riveting narrative.  Endurance is not just about Kelly's time on the ISS, but also delves into the training that led up to his becoming an astronaut. All of Kelly's experiences, from his time as an EMT on an ambulance to his career in the military flying fighter jets, contributed to his skill of calm focus in the face of extremes necessary to command the ISS. He also gives credit to those who molded and guided him on his journey, including his mom, who became the first female police officer in their home town of West Orange, New Jersey.  As ""civilians,"" we're fortunate to have this intimate glimpse into day-to-day life in space, and how the astronaut-adventurers come together to handle adversities, from space walk repairs to those dreaded phone calls from earth that something may be wrong with their loved ones back home. Endurance provides food for thought about our relationships with other nations and how precious our home planet truly is.  I had to carry a book of tape flags with me while reading this because I had to mark so many eye-opening passages that I didn't want to forget. I tortured my family with expositions and factoids that began, ""Listen to this, I read in Scott Kelly's book . . . ""  Without a doubt, you want to read this.  Many thanks to BookishFirst and Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group for the copy in exchange for my honest review. "
271,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33718320-samantha-colwell,3,"I received a copy of this book from Penguin Random House for an honest review.Scott Kelly's Endurance is a study in human achievement and the ISS is really the star of the show. Don't get me wrong--Scott Kelly is an interesting, personable, funny narrator, and his memoir is cohesive and strong. But the international space station, the way it functions and its purpose, is the most fascinating part of the novel. Endurance takes us in alternating chapters between episodes on the ISS and Kelly's life on earth: growing up with his twin brother, stressing in school over mediocre grades, the typical ""I wasn't great in school, but now I'm an astronaut"" thing. In spite of the fact that this book is about Kelly and his life, I found myself scanning through these chapters and moving onto the space station fodder. I loved learning about how the station works--how Kelly and cohorts eat in space, commit routine tasks, sleep on rotation, the politics of how human bodies endure. The progression of what man can achieve in space is so important to catalogue, and Kelly's memoir will go far in helping us understand the physical and mental toll a year in space can take. "
272,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19389289-paige,4,"It was difficult to put this memoir by former astronaut Scott Kelly down. This is the story of a living hero who comes across as approachable and relatable while also inspiring awe. I had limited background knowledge of the International Space Station or spaceflight, yet I was able to enjoy this book. This contained a fair amount of details and technical descriptions, but I never felt overwhelmed. What made this such an appealing read was that we never lose sight throughout that this is the personal story of an extraordinary man. And as remarkable as his accomplishments are, Scott Kelly the person does not get swallowed up by them. They are part of his experiences and he shares more than sugar coated versions. It was also fascinating to learn details about things including what it is like to prepare to launch into space, to command a space shuttle, and to live in space for a year. This book made me appreciate the space program, earth, and the tenacity of the human spirit."
273,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51021142-katie,5,"I wish I could give this book even more stars! I have read several other books written by astronauts about their time in space and Endurance is, by far, my favorite. The number of details included in this story makes it a very interesting read. Scott adds in many unique insights about his life on the iss, what led him to becoming an astronaut, what he was thinking or experiencing during different times and describing what the technical procedures are for. I highly recommend this book if you are interested in learning details about training, what astronauts experience during launch/reentry and what it is like to live in space."
274,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18904024-eugenia-hernandez,5,"I'm so happy to have come across this book. It's a real eye opener to read a true life experience of an Astronaut of our time. Scott Kelly has a lived a remarkable life. I found him to be surprisingly relatable. Contagious in spirit. Inspirational. Funny. A true soldier. Willing to risk his life for humanity. So grateful for all the Astronauts out there, and Russia for continuing to send people up to space. Definitely a must read!"
275,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3530176-alex-rogers,5,"Who doesn't love a good astronaut bio? But Kelly does it really well, and comes across as a very interesting, genuine human being. I think he has a lot to thank his ghostwriter for, as Kelly's voice comes through loud and clear. Fascinating life, amazing experiences. He strips away the ""glamour"" associated with astronauts, exposing instead the sheer hard work, professionalism, teamwork, pain and ingenuity required. A must read for anyone even slightly interested in what we are doing in space."

I enjoyed following Scott’s social media while he was in space so reading about his year in space and his memoirs about growing up and becoming an astronaut was a treat. I highly recommend. "

278,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32197772-joe-vigil,5,This is the best new book I've read all year! Cmdr Scott Kelly has written a real beautiful book. Anyone who has an interest in space and the ISS will not be able to put this one down. I know I couldn't!
279,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2048986-carrie-kellenberger,5,"Captain Scott Kelly has been on four flights to space and he is the US record holder for consecutive number of days spent in space. I don't know of any other person who has lived a life similar to his except for his identical twin brother Mark Kelly, who is also a fighter pilot, captain, and astronaut. Both brothers are also New York Times best-selling authors. I started my 2018 reading journey on two books: Endurance: A Year in Space, A Lifetime of Discovery by Scott Kelly and A Column of Fire by Ken Follett. I have been reading Scott Kelly's book at night and Ken Follett's book during the day. I happened to finish this one first and my oh my - 6 STARS. My hero has kept his hero status - not that I ever doubted Scott Kelly for a second. I've watched him rise in his career for years and followed his last space adventure with abnormal curiosity and utter fascination. Endurance: A Year in Space, A Lifetime of Discovery is a captivating memoir of Scott's journey to space and back to Earth. It also recounts his years of work towards becoming a fighter pilot and his formative years. I loved his writing style and his simple accounts of life in Russia while he was preparing for his flights to space as well as his accounts of life aboard the International Space Station. Time and time again, I was amazed at his observations and his perspectives on leadership, courage under pressure, and the importance of teamwork. Even after reading his book, it is hard for me to wrap my brain around some of the challenges he endured during his year in space and how he kept his cool. From the challenges of taking off and landing to isolation from everything and everyone he knows on Earth to the effects of space on the human body, there are just so many things in this book that made me pause and think. I loved his descriptions of how many types of aircrafts he learned to fly and the endless take offs and landings he performed in order to make his journey to space. I loved the descriptions of his camaraderie with the Russian Cosmonauts in ISS and I marvel at how two countries that were once at war are now co-existing in the same space in SPACE.I loved his compassion, his passion for life, and his sense of humor. I loved that he was able to describe his moments of unease and pain and push through them towards to horizon. There was so much I loved about this book, it is hard to put it all into a review. I've color-coded the whole book for passages I want to refer back to, but in all likelihood, I'll be writing a second review again once I've had a change to reread it. The only thing that really left me feeling dissatisfied with this book is that Captain Kelly doesn't address his issues with being back on Earth. The prologue mentions his pain, swelling and rashes, but the end of the book doesn't mention if these space symptoms have subsided or not. I have often wondered if I'd feel pain in space, and he answers my question thoroughly, but I'd like to know more about how he has done now that he has been back on Earth. Did his symptoms subside? Did they get worse? I guess I'll have to wait for his next book to find out. Either way, this one unanswered question was minuscule in comparison to all the other questions he answered about his year in space. Bravo, Astronaut Scott Kelly!Endurance: A Year in Space, A Lifetime of Discovery is a true testament to the strength of human will and resilience and the endless glory of imagination. Kelly has led a remarkable life, he wrote an incredible book, and the underlying message of hope: to never give up, to always persist at what you want - these are all takeaway lessons that I will remind myself of daily. Thank you, Captain Kelly, for your constant messages of hope and for your bravery and dedication to humanity. Best Takeaway Quotes from my first read: “I've learned that an achievement that seems to have been accomplished by one person probably has hundreds, maybe even thousands, of people's minds and work behind it, and I've learned that it's a privilege to be the embodiment of that work.”― Scott Kelly, Endurance: A Year in Space, A Lifetime of Discovery“What is it worth to see two former bitter enemies transform weapons into transport for exploration and the pursuit of scientific knowledge? What is it worth to see former enemy nations turn their warriors into crewmates and lifelong friends? This is impossible to put a dollar figure on, but to me it’s one of the things that makes this project worth the expense, even worth risking our lives.”― Scott Kelly, Endurance: A Year in Space, A Lifetime of DiscoveryI was up here as the only American with two Russian guys for six weeks this summer...and if something had happened to me, I would have counted on them for my life. We have a great relationship, and I think the international aspect of this program has been one of its highlights.― Scott Kelly, Endurance: A Year in Space, A Lifetime of DiscoveryYet the story of how we kept the space station cool - a huge chunk of metal flying through space getting roasted by the unfiltered sun for forty-five minutes out of every ninety while its enormous solar arrays generate electricity - is a story of engineering triumph with important implications for future space flight.― Scott Kelly, Endurance: A Year in Space, A Lifetime of Discovery"

At first I was relatively uninterested in the biographical aspects of the story, but as the book moved on I became more interested in Kelly and his life. I also enjoyed the glimpses of life aboard the space station. It certainly is not an easy life. "
281,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6904868-molly-mcinturff,5,"A fascinating memoir about Scott Kelly’s childhood, career as a US Navy fighter pilot and NASA astronaut, and his year-long mission at the International Space Station. I truly enjoyed it!"
282,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2526638-claudia-turner,5,"Scott Kelly is one of those rare individuals you meet only a few times in your life who has both a wild passionate soul and keen, calculating sense. He’s like Spock and Kirk rolled into one unforgettable space explorer. The title is fitting because throughout the book he cites the original “Endurance” about Shackleton’s exploration to Antarctica a century ago. Today we have the ISS and astronauts working against government apathy no to mention our understanding of time and space in order to reach into unknown regions of the universe and find if and how we’ll get to Mars. It all starts with a little grit and a lot of determination and Kelly (and his twin brother astronaut Mark Kelly) embody these traits. I’ve read quite a few astronaut and space books the last few years and one thing I’ve noticed is how difficult it is for many astronauts to maintain healthy marriages and relationships in general. There’s a lot of moving and traveling and being MIA for significant life events thats can strain the strongest of relationships. A lot of them didn’t come from cookie cutter backgrounds either and had to surpass life barriers that would break many a man. While everyone has their own perspective on their lives and the people that shaped them, Kelly does his best to understand and relate to the people he left behind even if it seems to fall short at times, like with his ex wife. Yet Kelly had one year at the ISS so a lot of time to really deconstruct his past, his place on earth, and how he got to where he is, and I love this soul searching, introspective type of writing. I also love his sense of humor and appreciation for minute details like with the flowers and toilet upon the ISS. Any great man/woman knows that greatness can’t exist without a lot of time given to all that appears trivial and inconsequential. All the little moments and the mundane aspects of life must be cared for and nurtured before “greatness” can be achieved. I appreciate Kelly’s thoughtfulness, his compassion, and most of all his adventurous spirit. He’s a true modern day explorer, a candid philosopher of sorts, and he would have made Shackleton proud."

Kimberly is even hosting a buddy read of it in July for her #greatspaceread!Endurance is one of those space memoirs that is mostly about the human condition and not about the science. I suck at science, but I LOVED this book and could not stop listening. At its core, this book is about a man’s willingness to go to almost any length to be a human lab rat for NASA to better understand space and our place within it.Kelly and his twin brother allowed their DNA to be used for research to help us figure out how to get to Mars. Scott lived on the ISS for a year while his twin stayed in Earth. But before all of that, Scott was your average teenager who didn’t know what to do with his life or how to take school serious. Then he read a book that gave him a clear goal, and he didn’t stop until he achieved that goal: flying a space shuttle.This book is full of jaw dropping moments. Moments you wouldn’t believe except, well, they did happen to Scott! I highly recommend this book to everyone and think we all can learn so much from Scott’s story.If you are looking for more on Scott and this year in space mission, there is a Netflix docuseries called....wait for it... A YEAR IN SPACE. But don’t watch it and hope to pass Kimberly’s Endurance test. She’ll know you cheated and didn’t read it."
284,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1384639-sandra,5,"As someone who has attended so many shuttle launches (one of which was Mr. Kelly’s flight in 1999) and landings and dreams of what its like to be in space, I was stoked to find out I was being given Endurance by Scott Kelly to review. I find outer space fascinating I follow the flight paths of the International Space Station (ISS)(which oddly enough will be crossing over my home at 6:22 p.m. tonight, and I am planning on watching it travel along on its journey with my high power binoculars). This book adds to my fascination. Retired Astronaut Scott Kelly is the longest occupying American resident of the ISS with 340 straight days in 2015-2016. Endurance is his memoir of that record-breaking stay and the rest of his “Lifetime of Discovery.” Selected to a ""year-long mission"" starting with Expedition 43, he then commanded Expedition 44 and 45, Mr. Kelly had put into practice what it was like to live on the Space Station two years before with his 5 months stay on the ISS during Expedition 26. His life journey through hardships in his childhood, his service in the Navy as a Pilot, fighting Prostate Cancer and those months of Expedition 43 prepared him for what came next. Endurance is the closest I will ever get to space and I ate up every word Mr. Kelly wrote. His struggles from being away from his family, his relationships, his joys, his mental and physical health, working with various countries Astronauts delving in Biomedical Engineering, his vivid explanations of the day to day jobs he completed were like a sci-fi novel turned reality. Can you imagine what it would be like to look at the earth and see it in all its glory, it’s distinguishing attributes? You don’t have to, Mr. Kelly gives you his view and feelings on what it is like. He makes you feel as if you are there, working, playing and traveling through zero gravity. The knowledge that you don’t have control over anything that happens on earth to your family is something that Mr. Kelly finds out about when his sister-in-law Congresswoman Gabriella Giffords is shot in Arizona at a Safeway grocery store parking lot meeting with constituents. Mr. Kelly had a few months left of his stay. A few things of what Mr. Kelly says of that experience, while leading the nation in a moment of silence concerning the horrific assassination attempt and deaths of six people and 13 injured that day in Tucson struck me as something to really chew on and change, and also some huge foreshadowing, “Those of us who have had the privilege to look down on the Earth from space get the chance to take a larger perspective of the planet and the people who share it. I feel more strongly than ever that we must do better” He explains after the moment of silence ""on the space station, we followed our normal routine. But I knew that on Earth somethings would never be the same.” Mr. Kelly’s life experiences told throughout this book show everyone that someone can come from obscurity and land into whatever they dream of becoming and beyond those dreams. This book is worth reading especially if you have any inkling of journeying from your own life to someone else’s and obviously if you love space exploration. This book hits one of my top five memoirs. Read it, you won’t regret it. Thanks to Bookish First for sending me a copy of Endurance: A Year in Space, A lifetime of Discovery I thoroughly enjoyed it. This book was given to me in lieu of my honest opinion."
285,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12691311-debbie,5,"I liked this book a lot! It was very interesting and held my interest throughout. Scott Kelly is a very funny guy and I liked how put that into the book. I learned a lot about the space industry. Most of it, I didn’t know. I certainly didn’t realize that there are still astronauts and that we are using Russia’s facilities. I now a little secret about dill, as well. Ha!! I think it’s great that we are cooperating with Russia in order to learn more about space and the secrets it holds. So many different things that I learned about were very extraordinary. A really good book that I enjoyed very much. Thanks to Bookish for providing me with a free copy of the book (a hard copy) in order for me to review."
286,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4474787-mimi,4,"Not only is the title a nod to Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage and it is interwoven in Kelly's time on the space station, but the reason that Scott goes into NASA is Tom Wolfe's The Right Stuff. I loved that reading was so integral to this story and loved Kelly's voice, history, and observations. It could have been a dry tome and was pleasantly live. "
287,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12765668-linda,4,"Capt. Scott Kelly, USN, a US astronaut extraordinaire, tells the compelling story of his life’s journey from a modest and underachieving childhood, to reading a book that changed his life, to becoming a Navy test pilot, then being accepted, along with his twin brother Mark, into the space program, and eventually taking up residence on the International Space Station for a full year. What an amazing adventure story! Scott isn’t a professional writer, and he had someone (Margaret Lazarus Dean) co-write with him, but Endurance felt like Scott told it his way, showing his faults as well as his triumphs, and teaching his readers enough about space travel to feel like we were almost along for the ride with him. I liked it a lot, scientific jargon notwithstanding."
288,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1432957-alison,5,"I’ll never go to space, but this book is a great replacement. Kelly’s account of his career and year in space captivated me. His writing is sometimes conversational, sometimes polished and poetic. His reflections on life after a year at the International Space Station are worth returning to again and again. I have a new respect for what it takes—mentally, physically, emotionally—to be an astronaut. I’ll be recommending this one for a while. “I’ve learned that an achievement that seems to have been accomplished by one person probably has hundreds, maybe even thousands, of people’s minds and work behind it, and I’ve learned that it’s a privilege to be the embodiment of that work.”"

From being 18 and captivated by Tom Wolfe’s The Right Stuff, to setting lofty, personal academic and professional goals, Scott Kelly proves that you can do “hard things” when you set your mind to it. Great book!"
290,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6005592-elena,2,Wasn't a masterpiece. I had to skip a lot and got really bored toward the end. It could have worked better if someone else had written it.

He has a very relaxed, witty style of writing and I enjoyed the jokes thrown in. It also wasn't so technical that you couldn't understand what he was talking about on the ISS. Highly recommend!"
292,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67612372-megan,3,"Oh my god, astronauts are so much braver than I thought.You know–everyone knows–deep down, that astronauts are a little bit crazy. They voluntarily launch themselves away from Earth at the speed of sound on top of a rocket that might be a bomb if it’s not regulated or cooled properly or if a tiny bolt is out of place, so that they can go explore what happens to people in a place that is passively trying to kill them at all times. Scott Kelly and his Russian counterpart, Misha Kornienko, lived up there for a year. In an environment that was gravity-less, water-less, air-less…people-less. The maximum number of people who were on the International Space Station while the two of them were completing their year in space was nine. Nine people to substitute the entire human race.Kelly’s anecdotes about the life on the ISS are brutally real, but told in such a matter-of-fact way that you almost forget the dangers. He reminds you, of course, that something as simple as fixing the toilet is a project of vital importance and that if a single bolt or screw goes floating off into the depths of the station, it might be lost forever. But it’s also funny to think about someone having the fix the toilet that’s in space. Kelly doesn’t shy away from these bits of humor, and even finds ways to make the tales of life-and-death zero-g shenanigans lighthearted and interesting. But there’s an underlying intensity that feels sort of like what I imagine living in space might feel like: you have to laugh at the monstrous vacuum trying to kill you, otherwise it will be too overwhelming to continue.Interspersed with tales from the ISS are chapters of how Scott Kelly became an astronaut. It was a long journey for him, from terrible student to Navy test pilot to various NASA jobs–space shuttle pilot, astronaut liaison with the Russian space agency, and finally long-flight mission astronaut. It’s quite a wild ride with various colorful characters and it shows a great resilience in Kelly, a perseverance and a determination that are incredibly important qualities in an astronaut.This book was very accessible–all of the hard science was explained in terms simple enough that even the most English-major-y of nerds (me) could understand. There were some technical bits that were a bit dense, but it was well worth reading through them to understand just how difficult rocket science really is. Or…space station science, I suppose. Anyone who read and enjoyed Andy Weir’s The Martian will probably like this book for similar reasons–fascinating scientific and technological explanations interspersed with a quiet sense of humor and personal journey narrative that disperses the intensity of the situation, but doesn’t detract from it.I highly recommend this book for lovers of space, for anyone who grew up looking at the stars and wishing they could walk among them. Reading Endurance is a little bit like living vicariously through Scott Kelly–maybe you’re the not one going on spacewalks and floating over to the Russian module for Friday dinners, but the sense of wonder and kinship between humanity and the starts is closer and more real. It’s a fascinating look at life in space and what it takes to get there–determination, a good sense of humor, an unparalleled strength, bravery, and…well, endurance."
293,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33105402-tyson,5,"“There's a starman waiting in the skyHe'd like to come and meet usBut he thinks he'd blow our mindsThere's a starman waiting in the skyHe's told us not to blow itCause he knows it's all worthwhile”Scott Kelly defines hard work in his career path to becoming an astronaut. His book does every justice to explain how he reached a point in his life where he become one of the only human beings to have the privilege to spend an entire year in outer space. His writing is enough to make even a person with minimal interest in space exploration envious of his opportunity.This was Kelly’s first book, which is not surprising because he seems to have been rather busy in the years preceding it. He worked hard to overcome obstacles, both personal and professional. For the most part, he seems like a no-nonsense kind of guy, a man who understands that in order to reach goals, much of it is the perseverance to help yourself. It is a quality that holds high importance in space, where there is nobody to hold your hand and resolve issues for you. Kelly’s attitude is not only symbolic but a literal protocol in his journey through 340 days spent on the International Space Station.Anybody can write a book about what they do. Whether it is a politician or a professional ball player, autobiographies have the capability to let us into the minds and lives of people who live in ways most of us probably won’t ever experience. But Kelly’s book is different. It is harder to wrap your head around, a grossly more monumental production because of all it entails. He leaves the planet, lives primarily on his own, and is responsible for things that we, as gravity-stuck humans, only know nature for taking care of (like providing air to breathe or keeping our food on our plates). Things we don’t blink an eye at, he faced as trials and tribulations, inhibitions to simple tasks like eating, moving, sleeping, and basic life functions.Please take the time to read this book. Please find Kelly’s social media accounts (Instagram most importantly) and follow along. Kelly, who had to learn how to do so many things to further his career, his personal life, and his days in space, has seemed to naturally add another to his list when he wrote this autobiography. It is a wonderful addition to the adventurous genre of travel."
294,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27943513-brian-mccue,4,A brief biography of Scott Kelly's life and his recent year-long stay in the ISS. Intensely interesting if you've ever wondered how the International Space Station functions. Lots of insights about the actual science of space travel with an emphasis on the hardships and how they apply to traveling to Mars. This book will make you watch all your favorite sci/fi films and read all your sci/fi books in a new light. Space is scary. Real scary. 
295,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6014143-dena,3,I really liked Scott Kelly's memoir. I have no desire myself to push the boundaries of space and his ability to share the joys as well as the hardships of it was fascinating. This is real space. Not sci-fi or Diet Space and certainly not for the claustrophobic or weak of stomach. Off to stalk Kelly's IG account.

299,1524731595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1976637-jeff,4,"If my Wisconsin math is correct, this is my sixth astronaut memoir /biography/ autobiography and I'd rank it in that collection behind only the Sally Ride and Mike Massimino books. Scott Kelly is the American astronaut selected to spend a year in space aboard the ISS and this is his story of that experience. Actually, the book jumps back and forth between long mission on the ISS and the backstory of how he got there. I found both to be interesting, however, I was much more intrigued by his experiences in space. I listened to Endurance in audio. Scott's narration was straight ahead and usually without emotion or much inflection, unlike the book self-narrated by astronaut Mike Massimino who is a natural storyteller and hilarious. Still, Scott was a competent storyteller and had a knack for explaining the technical aspects of his life, and did throw some humor in here and there. He named his book Endurance after Shackleton's ship which was destroyed in his ill-fated journey to the South Pole. He brought Shackleton's book to space in order to remind himself that no matter how hard life became in space was it wasn't as bad as what Shackleton's expedition went through. The times he spent in space including the travel to and from space, were fascinating and covered not only his year-long stint on the ISS, but is first six-month ISS mission as well has his space shuttle missions and trips on the Soyuz. He does a nice job documenting his unique experiences in a relatable way. Scott and his Russian counterpart (who also spent a year on the ISS) were pushed to the physical limits living in zero G for so long and pushed to the mental limits knowing that they were away from friends and loved ones (and the whole damn Earth!) for a year. Scott said several times his biggest fear was that something bad would happen to one of his family members while he was in space as there would be nothing he could do to help. Sure enough, his sister-in-law congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords of AZ was shot in the head during a public appearance in Tucson. All he could do was watch the TV coverage from space. Some of the most interesting parts of the book for me were his comparisons of the Russian and American space agencies. Surprisingly, they both had very different sets of rules and philosophies, not to mention the differences between the Soyuz and the now-retired Space Shuttles. Some of his terrestrial stories were less interesting, like the unraveling of his marriage and troubles with his daughters. One of the unique things about Scott's time in space was that his identical twin, Mark, was on earth and was Scott's experimental control for the tests about the long term effects of living in space on Scott's body. Their almost identical physiology and DNA could be compared. The book ends shortly after Scott returns to earth so the results of these experiments were not included in the book. I guess that's what Google is for. One of Scott's final comments was an echo of the messages I've heard from other astronauts: from space the Earth appears to be an oasis in an infinite backdrop of stars and other galaxies, all too far to reach, so we humans need to get our act together and treat it as the special place it is.
