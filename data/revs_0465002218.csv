0,0465002218,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2011093-david-cain,1,"I was seriously underwhelmed by this work. At a high level, I think it's great that there's a new publication that presents a case for the biological and genetic drivers of human evolution even during the recent historic period. I certainly agree with this perspective, and it adds a nice layer of evidence to other recent popular works dealing with human history in the Holocene. The devil is in the details, however, and this is where the book comes up short.I was very frustrated by this book's orientation very firmly in the ""popular science"" genre rather than being more scientifically rigorous. There were far fewer citations than appropriate, and many claims were presented as fact without a shred of supporting evidence. Far too often, the authors (Cochran and Harpending) resorted to descriptions like ""completely obvious"" or ""undoubtedly"" to refer to their own arguments and ""simply incorrect"", etc. to diminish opposing viewpoints without actually exploring WHY their own ideas were correct and opposing ideas might not be accurate. The authors sometimes acknowledge contradictory arguments or evidence but never explore them in anything but the most cursory fashion.One of my biggest problems is that most of this book presents one big straw man argument. The authors repeatedly assert that conventional wisdom stipulates that no evolution has occurred in recent human history, and that current anthropological thought indicates that all patterns and changes in the last 10,000 years may be ascribed to cultural or environmental forces rather than biological ones. I suspect they are primarily aiming their sights at Jared Diamond's ""Guns, Germs, & Steel"" as well as selected works of Stephen Jay Gould. But really, this is not at all conventional wisdom in the scientific community, and there are plenty of books, papers, and people who will argue that a combination of cultural, environmental, and yes, biological and genetic factors have been important shapers of recent human destiny.I'm not going to get up on my soapbox and impress myself with my own intelligence by detailing a catalogue of complaints about the specific arguments in this work, or expounding upon what I believe to be more compelling arguments. Suffice to say that I have advanced degrees in related areas and worked as a professional anthropologist/archaeologist for years, so I consider my perspective to be an informed one. Here are two examples that I would consider to be representative of the flawed logic, methods, and philosophy of the entire work:Chapter two presents their conclusion that Homo sapiens must have exchanged genes with Homo neanderthalensis. Based on what new evidence that now proves this old idea, you might ask? NONE! It's a compelling theory, but as of yet there is no conclusive support. Among their claims? ""We can only say that humans are known to have had sexual congress with [all sorts of things:]...any port in a storm"", as well as ""a gene that plays a role in speech was replaced by a new variant some 42,000 years ago...it is likely that the migrating humans picked it up from Neanderthals, since that's about the time they encountered them in their expansion out of Africa"". These kind of unsupported and ridiculous leaps of faith do not have a logical link to Cochran and Harpending's ultimate conclusions, and it is irresponsible to reach such a firm and adamant conclusion when supported by such a weak foundation of evidence. Don't get me wrong, I agree that genetic admixture between these groups was possible (perhaps even likely). Just don't insult my intelligence by building such a poor case with such strong and decisive language.The final chapter discusses the reasons why Ashkenazi Jews are more intelligent than everyone else. The whole idea of measuring intelligence is subject to a variety of biases and problems. Rather than building a case that the pattern they describe is indeed real and valid - by first systematically reviewing objections to the concept of IQ measurement - they breeze through these objections in a single paragraph. That is intellectually dishonest - let's see some systematic scientific arguments rather than ad hoc rationalization, please. Not to mention that they ignore the social implications of their perspective - namely, that this type of thinking can be used to support racism in all its pernicious guises. If some groups are smarter than others, it follows that other groups would be dumber than average, and it is a slippery slope from this kind of thinking to arguing for institutionalized discrimination, eugenics, etc.In short, this work leaves much to be desired. The style is unscientific and many of the conclusions are non sequiturs based on weak presentation of evidence and avoidance of opposing views. I would suggest skipping this one for something less partisan and more soundly scientific."
1,0465002218,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3749410-aaron-arnold,4,"I remember, back when I was in college, participating in one of those classic college-style drunken debates with some friends about whether evolution was speeding up or slowing down. I argued, no doubt with some slurring of words, that that the increase in the complexity of life meant that there were more and more things for evolution to operate on, and that therefore evolution was speeding up. They argued the opposite, that evolution was fastest back when organisms were simple, and a change in allele frequency would have been proportionately larger as a percentage of the gene pool. Obviously from the sober light of day years later this was an argument over semantics, how we were defining the base unit of comparison, but I still sometimes encounter the equivalent opinion that evolution for humans has either slowed or stopped, backed by the contention that humans in particular are now somehow beyond the laws of natural selection governing the lesser inhabitants of the earth. Cochran and Harpending have a fairly slim popular science book that takes aim at that same misconception that bothered me, but while I agree wholeheartedly with their thesis that humans are not somehow exempt from evolution, I have a few qualms with the book. For the most part it reads like a counterpart to the frequently-cited Jared Diamond's Guns, Germs, and Steel, in that while Diamond spent a lot of time talking about how Europeans benefited from having more and better domesticatable plants and animals and the like, he did not concentrate as much as he could have on how much of a two-way street that was, meaning the symbiotic nature of the evolutionary pressures humans were putting on those plants and animals. Put crudely, ancient humans spent a lot of time domesticating things like horses or corn, and since doing that gave groups which were successful advantages over other groups that weren't, you could look at that domesticating process as not only selecting future horses and corn, but also future humans who were better at at the domesticating process itself. Once humanity realized that it had the power to manipulate its environment, that unleashed a self-reinforcing cascade of selective forces, which are not only still operating today, but could very well be speeding up. I agree wholeheartedly with this basic idea, and for the most part C & H do a solid if somewhat breezy job of explicating it. Their main sin (which of course is also a virtue in the popular science market) is that they are so confident in their theory of accelerating anthropogenic selection pressures that they seemingly incapable of devoting more than a few dismissive sentences to previous research or competing views. It makes the book livelier and more readable, but you can't help but be a little suspicious of the result. So you will have controversial sections like the opening one on possible interbreeding between ancient homo sapiens and Neanderthals that are very interesting and seem to make compelling logical sense, yet to a layman deliver an impression of either non-engagement with or the passing over of broad swathes of scientific work. That comes with the pop-sci territory though, and since I'm not a genetic historian, I will give them a pass on the question of accuracy. At its core, this book is about the self-domestication of society, a process which has been going on for several thousand years, but over the past few millennia (and the past few centuries in particular) had dramatic effects on human behavior. Scientists like Steven Jay Gould have assumed that humans have been mostly unchanged for the past few thousand years, but Cochran and Harpending strongly disagree, using analogies like the rapid changes in species like dogs and data on specific subgroups of humans with unique selection pressures (more on that later). It's impossible to overstate the dramatic effect that the invention of agriculture had on homo sapiens. It was a complete game-changer in terms of sustenance, culture, warfare, and our relationship to the environment. There's a good discussion of subtleties in the Malthusian trap, the theory whereby any increase in food production is quickly eaten up by the resulting increase in population. This is true in broad terms, but the quantitative and qualitative difference in lifestyle that agriculture provides is the catalyst for an immense speedup in the churn of genes. It upsets the balance between deaths from conflict, disease, and starvation (pestilence, war, and famine, if you want to get Biblical about it), which matters from a selection standpoint. Groups of humans that master agriculture will not only be better fed, but they will have enough surplus to devote to increasing the complexity of their civilization as well as having different immune systems due to contact with livestock and other animals. C & H speculate that the dramatic expansion of Proto-Indo-European-speaking tribes might be due to the advantages conferred by lactose tolerance, and there's also the familiar example of the contrast between European colonization of the Americas thanks to diseases like smallpox and the failure of the same (except in South Africa) due to lack of resistance to malaria. Where the book gets the most controversial is in claiming that this process of adaptation is having effects within several human generations, aiming squarely at Gould's contention in books like The Mismeasure of Man that the basic hardware of humanity hasn't changed much in the past few tens of thousands of years. I can certainly agree that it seems like there's been an increase in traits favoring abstract reasoning since the Bronze Age. The human environment we find ourselves in today is simply not like the small scattered settlements of a few thousand years ago, and as witnessed by the dramatic explosion in diversity of species like dogs that undergo rapid, determined selection pressures, it's perfectly possible that we have been consciously or unconsciously breeding ourselves in particular directions that favor success in modern society. Modern society might also create many avenues for misusing those traits of abstract reasoning and logical deduction (endless fan-wiki pages on obscure TV shows are a good example of these faculties gone awry - this is on a surface level identical to doing real knowledge work, but is completely sterile), however it seems reasonable to say that, Idiocracy aside, smarter people might have a definite reproductive advantage in environments that reward cleverness over the long haul. Does that mean that we could see groups of people today who are measurably smarter than others? To be as blunt as the final chapter, are groups like Ashkenazi Jews or East Asians simply smarter than ""generic"" Caucasians, as seen by their greater average IQ scores and disproportionate success in fields that demand high cognitive complexity? To be even blunter, by that same reasoning does that imply that groups like sub-Saharan Africans or aboriginal Australians simply less smart than ""generic"" Caucasians? Cochran and Harpending, to their credit, present this contention with as positive a spin as you could expect, casting this investigation into potential genetic differences between groups as an opportunity for more research and possible positive gene therapy rather than as justification for something like apartheid or a Brave New World society. Certainly nothing in an acknowledgement that some groups might have a higher mean IQ than others implies any kind of justification for racist policies any more than acknowledging that an individual might have a higher IQ than another does. But given the high temperatures that accompany any research that even glancingly appears to support eugenics or racial determinism (witness the shameful ""Wilson, you're all wet"" treatment that E. O. Wilson received), plus all of the well-known historical failures of pseudo-scientific intelligence testing, I'd like for further studies and for books that don't seem so flippant. I don't believe we have anything to fear from further research into the genetic basis of human intelligence - far from it. Let's just make sure we proceed with a little more rigor than I did as a drunken undergraduate."
2,0465002218,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6611501-lou-schuler,5,"This was recommended by a friend of mine, an archaeologist. It came out of our mutual dislike of the notion, promoted by some advocates of the paleo diet, that humans of the late stone age were perfectly adapted to their environment, and thus stopped evolving. By that logic, agriculture (and everything that followed) was a huge mistake.Except, as it turns out, agriculture was a force for rapid and continued evolution. Lactose tolerance was a huge advantage to the first people who developed it. Same with the adaptations that allowed humans to thrive on grains as a staple of the diet. And although the authors don't say it -- and probably weren't even thinking it at the time they wrote it -- the book ends with what may turn out to be an instructive look at how our current society is evolving.The final chapter is called ""Medieval Evolution: How the Ashkenazi Jews Got their Smarts."" This particular group, who originally settled in what are now Germany and Poland, are known for high intelligence (with an average IQ 12-15% above the norm) and for devastating genetic disorders. My guess is that they're also an example of assortative mating: the most intelligent people of a group marry each other and have even more intelligent kids, who go on to marry the children of other intelligent parents. Now we're seeing something similar, with dual-career couples of highly educated professionals living around and associating almost exclusively with similarly accomplished couples. This is happening at a time when the economic system has shifted toward increasing rewards for cognitive skill. But with this push toward the outer edges of human potential comes an otherwise inexplicable rise in autistic-spectrum disorders. It may turn out that there's no link between the two and I'm completely off base. But it would seem to follow the same pattern described by the authors. I read this book right before reading The Sports Gene, by David Epstein, which follows the same threads to help explain why extraordinary athletes seem to cluster in certain populations. The two books together give us a fascinating -- if still speculative -- look at the speed of human evolution in the right circumstances."
3,0465002218,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1780231-tracy-black,2,"I made it a little over the half-way mark before setting this one down. The writing style is easy to read and there are a few good ideas in there. Here are the problems though. 1. It's dumbed down and watered down. The authors assume the read is an idiot and doesn't know any history at all, and so give broad, watered-down histories. Like the history of agriculture in two pages. It's absolutely no help to someone unfamiliar with it, and frustratingly oversimplified to someone who is.2. Very few claims were supported with actual facts. One claim at the end of Ch.5 was that the problem solving abilities and scientific thinking in Europe were genetic, and this is what spawned the industrial and scientific revolutions. They demonstrated how this benefited society, but didn't even attempt to show how these traits could have made the ""scientists"" more fit, in that they would have more offspring. A gene can't become more common in a population any other way. They also didn't attempt to show that Europeans had some gene related to problem solving that other populations don't have. Personally, I like the idea of coffee replacing alcohol as the popular beverage sparking the scientific revolution. There's absolutely no support for it having a genetic basis, and plenty for it having a cultural basis.Maybe it gets better in the second half, but my reading queue is to full to waste any more time on it."
4,0465002218,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4353795-greg-linster,5,"The evolutionary biologist, Steven Jay Gould, once famously said that “There’s been no biological change in humans in 40,000 or 50,000 years. Everything we call culture and civilization we’ve built with the same body and brain.” Nonsense say University of Utah anthropologists Gregory Cochran and Henry Harpending. Their book, The 10,000 Year Explosion, dismantles Gould’s claim in elegant fashion by arguing that human evolution has not stagnated, but rather, it has actually accelerated rapidly. In fact, so much so that it “is now happening about 100 times faster than its long-term average over the six million years of our existence.”Read the rest of my review of The 10,000 Year Explosion here."
5,0465002218,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3692244-rev,2,"Overall, I felt that this book was lacking in scientific soundness. Where there needed to be citations, there were not. The authors failed to systematically go through objections or proofs for a ton of their claims. The almost-condescending tone that the authors adopted at times was unwarranted, especially in light of their failure to provide sufficient viable resources. As for the chapter about Ashkenazi Jews, I was left asking, ""So what?"", along with a feeling of great apprehension due to discussions about correlations between race/ethnicity and IQ. Too many neglected implications. However, it wasn't all completely bad news; I did learn a few things based on some interesting information (read: not unverified claims) they presented. "
6,0465002218,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1310120-lisa,1,"In retrospect, John Derbyshire doing the blurb on the back might have tipped me off, but I'd spotted the book in the Museum of Natural History bookshop and this is the first time they've steered me wrong...Not good science, plain and simple. Saying something is 'completely obvious' or brushing a countering argument aside as 'incorrect' may sound authoritative, but means nothing if not backed up by evidence. And often, the evidence is lacking. For example, the authors would have us believe that science shows that modern humans crossbred with Neanderthals. Unfortunately, they present no evidence. Does it make sense that humans probably got it on with Neanderthals? Certainly. Do the authors present evidence for successful cross-species reproduction? No.But that's not the only problem. The authors are eager to attribute things to genetics that have no obvious connection to reproductive fitness (again with little or no evidence) and do more than just flirt with discredited notions of racial intelligence. I had started to feel uncomfortable with the direction the authors were going- Europeans are the most evolved, Australian aboriginals and African bushmen the least- well before I noticed the title of the last chapter- which purports to be about why Ashkenazi Jews are more intelligent than other groups. Based on IQ tests, which the authors accept as reasonable measures of intelligence unaffected by socioeconomic factors, and a number of prominent Jewish scientists. That's the point at which I quit. If I wanted to read racist pseudoscience, I would look up something from 1930s Germany. In short, this book is a waste of time. With so many other books on my to-read list, I could have used that time on something worthwhile."
7,0465002218,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1680974-alex-zakharov,5,"Provocative and very entertaining read. The main thesis is that human genetic evolution has been ongoing (if not accelerating) over the last 10000 years (which on a typical evolutionary scale is an insignificant timeframe). And the main mechanism facilitating such development is a rapidly changing culture. For example the shift from hunter-gatherers to agriculture had profound consequences at genetic level. Mixing of modern humans (coming north from Africa) with Neanderthals was another boost for increased gene flow and of course just your plain increase in population combined with expansions/colonization expedited gene swapping significantly. All sorts of interesting arguments are made from relatively uncontroversial lactose intolerance to more controversial theories of dominance of Indo-European language group, IQ prowess of Ashkenazi Jews and evolutionary selection for long-term planning. Whether you buy those arguments or not they make for a fascinating and overall rather compelling read.My main criticism is authors’ neglect of epigenetics or Gould’s punctuated equilibrium. Both are highly relevant to the topic at hand and can either tank or enhance authors’ arguments. For example punctuated equilibrium may help explain recent “sudden” genetic acceleration from a different angle. Much more interesting is gene-environment interaction from epigenetics perspective. Authors’ argument still heavily relies on Crick’s “central dogma of molecular biology” that puts DNA front-and-center of any evolutionary process. But what has been becoming increasingly clear is that gene regulation and specifically gene transcription factors play a massive role in gene expression - in other words the same gene can be expressed very (sometimes drastically) differently depending on transcription factors/promoters involved. And transcription factors can be (and often are) triggered by environment! So then one can argue that many changes in species are not the result of genetic changes but rather environmental changes that trigger different transcription mechanisms. Yet one has to be careful with gene regulators which are themselves coded for by DNA and so the evolution of a regulator can be just as important (if not more) than evolution of the gene itself. Anyway it gets complicated but completely ignored by the authors that heavily bias their on analysis on good old gene-level mutations and classic Darwinian selection. Ps for a pretty strong argument against gene-centric view see this excellent article http://aeon.co/magazine/science/why-i...For a more middle-ground reconciling approach see Sapolsky’s bit here http://aeon.co/magazine/science/an-ex..."
8,0465002218,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25371127-rossdavidh,5,"""The 10,000 Year Explosion: How Civilization Accelerated Human Evolution"", by Gregory Cochran and Henry Harpending, is the work of two professors, one a physicist and the other an anthropologist; it's about the idea that human evolution has not only not ceased, but it has even gotten faster recently. The fact that Cochran is listed as ""a physicist and Adjunct Professor of Anthropology"" gives a hint at the boundary-crossing nature of this book's point of view.Not so long ago (still today, in some cases) textbooks and other expert sources would say that human evolution had basically stopped once we acquired the rudiments of technology, or at any rate was too slow to have made any change in us since then. There is a more recent school of thought which asserts just the opposite: we are still evolving, and are doing so at a faster rate than ever.There are a few cases that are now fairly well documented, such as lactose tolerance. In the U.S. we think of lactose intolerance (the inability to digest milk after early childhood) as being the abnormality, but in fact it is lactose tolerance that is the recent oddity, still a minority among the world's population. In a few places, though, such as northern Europe and eastern Africa, lactose tolerance is the norm. These places are, not surprisingly, the ones where cattle have been kept for a long time.But not that long. If the few thousand years that humanity has kept domesticated cattle is long enough to evolve a major change to how we digest food, then evolution is not necessarily always so slow as we had thought. For that matter, we know that things like skin color have evolved in the time since some humans left Africa (and others stayed behind), so one begins to wonder why scientists ever thought that there was no difference in the genetics of modern humans and those of 50,000 years ago.Not long into ""The 10,000 Year Explosion"", we are reminded why. Once you admit that we may be significantly different, genetically, than our ancestors of 50,000 years ago, we have the disquieting possibility that different races might not be the same. Of course, in one sense this is a tautology; if they were genetically the same, we wouldn't call them different races. But, assertions of one race or another being more highly evolved had a nasty history of popping up on behalf of whoever had military and political power in the 19th and early 20th century, and most scientists have steered clear of the idea since then.It's been a couple generations since this kind of thing, however, and Cochran and Harpending are ready to Go There. They do so, however, in a politically circumspect way, by looking at the elevated IQ's of Ashkenazi Jews in Europe. The theory is that, because of religious strictures against intermarriage with Gentiles, the Ashkenazi Jews were a reproductively distinct group for nearly two thousand years. They also had a distinctly IQ-based lifestyle for nearly a thousand years, from about 800 A.D. to about 1650 A.D., with frequent massacres and other persecutions to provide the brutal selection against the less successful, along with the basic fact that pre-modern life resulted in a lot of starvation if you weren't a farmer, and also weren't financially successful. Cochran and Harpending assert that this unique ""environment"" led to a relatively rapid evolution in favor of higher IQ among this one group, relative to the rest of us. Hey, maybe.The larger point of recent evolution also includes less controversial examples, like the fact that Europeans had been living in large cities, and thus acquiring disease resistance, far longer than the New World civilizations they came into contact with, and conquered. On the other hand, when the white man went into areas with malaria, they often found their guns mattered less than mosquitoes; France's failed attempt to reconquer Haiti is one of many examples where the (genetic, and recently evolved) resistance to malaria of native populations gave them the ability to throw off colonial empires. Surely it's no coincidence that the people whose ancestors had long lived with the threat of those diseases were able to fight them off better.But, if evolution is being sped up by cultural innovations like keeping cattle for milk, or living in large cities; and if (as I think we would all accept) the pace of change in the last few centuries has been even faster, does this mean our own evolution is speeding up even faster as well? And is this a good thing, on balance, or bad? It is, of a certainty, a thing worth pondering."
9,0465002218,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5188452-james-caterino,5,"I have a long held interest in evolution and anthropology. Beyond an interest actually. More like an endless fascination. Some would even say obsession. I am a the the Tea Party/GOP's worst nightmare. I cannot be bullied into falling into the current line of thinking that the earth is 6000 years old. I know better. Enough about fables and delusions and on to science and The 10,000 Year Explosion: How Civilization Accelerated Human Evolution.As soon as I opened up this book and started to read, I could not stop. I devoured it. Then I read it again. It is utterly fascinating. The book is about exactly what the title says, how the last 10,000 years human evolution is rapidly accelerating due to the adaptions of civilization. We change phyically to adapt to changes from geography, climate, diet, but these are not slow mutations that occur over millions or even hundreds of thousands of years as they have been throughout most of the planet's evolutionary history. These are now rapid changes at the genetic level involving alterations at the chromosomal level called alleles. They can occur in as little as several generations, and the rate of change is increasing dramtically.The authors go back beyond 10,000 years ago to indentify the time when this explosion of acceleration first began 30,000 years ago. They indentify the exact event. For me this was best part of the book because it something that I always believed and the authors make a strong case to back up their somewhat irrevereant theory. I will not give it away here. It would be akin to giving a away a major spoiler to a novel. But anyone with an interest in anthropology or evolution of human history will find it facinating.My only problem I had with this book is the use of of the term ""ape-like"". It is a pet peeve of mine and scientists should know better. Humans ARE great apes so referring to a non-human behavior as ""ape-like"" is a contradiction.In many ways The 10,000 Year Explosion reads like the anthropolgy equivilant to a Michio Kaku physics book. That makes perfect sense since one of the authors is a physicist. Overall, this book is a pop science masterwork with some terrific insights and revoltionary theories. Together with Guns, Germs, and Steel, it makes for the perfect new wave evolution double feature."
10,0465002218,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7959326-stephen,5,"Conventional wisdom holds that genetic evolution takes place over extremely long periods of time--thousands of years--so that, in the 10K years since the beginning of agriculture, humans' gene-culture coevolution has been overwhelmingly dominated by the cultural component. The book The 10,000 Year Explosion will cure you of that misconception. Genetic innovation follows the same S-shaped adoption curve as cultural or technological innovation, maybe with similar ""crossing the chasm"" obstacles. The authors point out that the rate of group innovation (whether biological or cultural) is a function of three variables: the individual innovation rate, the number of individuals, and the diffusion rate. As human populations have grown exponentially, so too have the mutations that provide fodder for natural selection. The diffusion rate depends on several factors, e.g.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusio...most importantly innovation advantage and communication rate. Modern technologies provide far more frequent contact and rapid transport, which poses a serious threat from new diseases but a wonderful opportunity for advantageous human mutations."
11,0465002218,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1019174-terence,2,"The basic argument of The 10,000 Year Explosion (10KYE) is two-fold. The first assertion is that biological evolution still affects the human species, which is evident within historic memory. The second half of the argument is that evolution has accelerated since the Agricultural Revolution c. 12,000 years ago. The authors look at four turning points in human development: (1) the displacement of the Neanderthal c. 40,000 years ago by modern humans, (2) the Agricultural Revolutions (more properly, “revolutions” as farming was discovered several times in several places), (3) Indo-European expansion c. 5,000 years ago, and (4) the cognitive development of Ashkenazi Jews in Medieval Europe.The second half of the argument is essentially one of numbers. Agriculture permitted an enormous increase in population and density. More genes allowed for more mutations, for good or ill. Beyond the absolute numbers, lies another fact: Humans were now living in environments radically different from those their hunting-gathering ancestors wandered in. Selective pressures fell (are falling) on different genes, and better adapted populations expanded at the expense of less well adapted. I think the evidence is becoming quite clear that this part of Cochran and Harpending’s (C/H) argument is certain. The details of why and what adaptations developed are still matters of controversy. The most infamous evidence for this is Old World humans’ resistance to epidemic diseases like small pox. This adaptation New World humans lacked, and they paid a horrific price.* The first part of the authors’ argument is more tendentious, at least in regards to points (1) and (4), so I’ll deal with (2) and (3) first:Point 2 – the consequences of agriculture:1. Old World humans developed resistance to a variety of infectious diseases that became common or evolved in the relatively close-packed, sedentary communities of post-farming humanity.2. Expansion into more northerly latitudes tended to favor lighter skin color. It’s interesting that the genes that activate this trait are different in East Asian populations vs. European ones. A difference that suggests different evolutionary pressures were working on these groups. Another interesting point the authors make is that the European gene (or complex of genes) has had the most visible consequences – Europeans show the greatest variety of hair, eye and skin color.3. Human skeletons have become more gracile, and skull volume has decreased.4. The acceleration of genetic mutations has resulted in an abnormally high (compared to other species) rate of miscarriage.5. A large number of mutations are found in genes that control human cognition and the nervous system. C/H suggest some of these mutations are the results of trade offs between muscle and brain power. Other mutations point to changes in the ear, which may be related to language development.It’s instructive to read this section in light of my recent perusals of The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind and The Humans Who Went Extinct Why Neanderthals died out and we survived. Jaynes would agree that humans haven’t always thought the same way but it doesn’t require belief in Jaynes’ theories to accept the fact that our ancestors could have thought in profoundly different ways than we do. Finlayson supports the opposite view, apparently – human cognition hasn’t significantly changed in a quarter of a million years (which, I think, is too extreme a position).6. Farming cultures were always on the edge of starvation since populations expands more rapidly than food supply (the Malthusian trap). This had the interesting consequence that the better off were reproductively more successful than the poor. Thus, if there were any biological basis for their success, the wealthier passed on their genes to future generations while the poors’ were lost. (This, too, flies in the face of Finlayson’s belief that marginal populations are the more successful in evolutionary crises.)7. As a species, humans became more tractable (i.e., tamed). Aggressive behavior (particularly among males) may have had an evolutionary advantage in a scattered, hunter-gathering economy but in the new agricultural communities, its utility was reduced and could be downright disadvantageous. As a consequence, nicer, less aggressive humans became more successful. We may decry our modern propensity to follow the herd but without it, modern life would be impossible.Here, C/H make one of their more controversial and, IMO, more specious arguments: That in nonagricultural populations one will find less submissive individuals, indicated by their unwillingness to be enslaved. They point to the absence of Native American slaves in European colonies as evidence for this, ignoring their earlier contention that New World humans couldn’t easily live with Old Worlders because of the disease issue and ignoring the historical record. I think this is a case of carrying biological determinism too far. Biologically there were any number of reasons that Old and New World humans couldn’t mix easily but that one was the uncontrollable aggression of New World captives seems far fetched. Among themselves Native Americans were more than happy to enslave each other, and I’m sure that had they been less susceptible to disease would have been better represented on Spanish haciendas and American plantations.8. So-called bourgeois virtues – hard work, deferred gratification, property (biologically – securing resources necessary for successful procreation) and selfishness – became advantageous and were pressured for selection.9. Agriculture selected for cognitive traits that made trade and long-range planning easier.Here again the authors make another of their ill-supported, poorly integrated claims: Modern-day nonagricultural societies may have an evolutionary disadvantage in adopting and adapting to modern society above and beyond any barriers erected by colonialist policies, racism and corrupt politicians because their brains aren’t as capable of thinking in a “farming” mode as long-established agricultural societies. This is another example, IMO, of biological determinism run amok. You don’t have to invoke biology to understand why so many countries worldwide are still “developing” after centuries of supposed aid, or to explain Western domination of the modern era.I like point (3). Here’s an example where a biological basis for the observed history has some foundation. About 5,000 years ago, a group of tribes spread out from a common homeland (probably south Russia/Ukraine between the Black and Caspian seas) to overrun earlier tribes from the Atlantic to India. Their dominance is reflected today in the fact that half the planet still speaks languages descended from these Indo-Europeans. What contributed to Indo-European success has confounded historians and archaeologists for years. The authors point out that arguments from technological superiority or social organization falter in the fact that these traits (esp. the technical ones) are easily copied. They might have explained initial success but can’t account for the continued success of Indo-European expansion over the course of several millennia. C/H contend that the secret of their success was their lactose tolerance. Because Indo-Europeans were able to more efficiently utilize their cattle, they had reproductive advantages that drove them on to overwhelm their less efficient neighbors.It’s an intriguing hypothesis that I find moderately persuasive.Now we return to points (1) and (4).Point (1): Around 40,000 BC, a profound change in the material culture of modern humans expanding into the Middle East and Europe took place. This is most spectacularly represented in the cave art of southern France and northern Spain. C/H lay the emergence of these innovations squarely at the feet of the Neanderthal, who contributed genes by mating with incoming moderns.To begin with, the assertion that our ancestors successfully mated with Neanderthals is far from settled. From my reading, there’s no clear evidence that H. neanderthalensis contributed anything to our genome but the science is still in its infancy and I remain, and the authors should have remained, agnostic on the subject. Or at least provided greater evidence for it. If it becomes obvious that my great-to-the-Nth-degree grandfather Skrag the Hunter was a Neanderthal, I’ll happily accept him at the next family reunion.**Again, it’s instructive to read Clive Finlayson’s The Humans Who Went Extinct, where he points out that the timing is all wrong for a material-cultural explosion and our encounters with Neanderthals, and that the cave paintings are unique to France and Spain. Nowhere else do we find a culture that expressed itself in the same way. Indeed, the art of the earliest sites is clearly from a different tradition than that of later sites (which are separated by 20 millennia). And – if the preceding weren’t enough – material culture is rarely preserved. We are in no position to make generalizations based on the evidence we have.The authors’ fourth example of recent evolutionary change is the most sensitive in this day and age: The Ashkenazi Jews of Central Europe evolved measurably greater cognitive abilities reflected in their disproportionate representation in finance and the sciences. This difference from their neighbors arose because of centuries of reproductive isolation and inbreeding (a cultural consequence of Christian anti-Semitism). I don’t find the idea that such isolation may have selected for a particular genetic expression. European Jews were genetically isolated and forced into occupations that Christians wouldn’t or were forbidden to do (i.e., banking) to a much greater extent than outside of Europe. But I’m not convinced that it has a biological basis, or a significant one at any rate. C/H claim that the successful Ashkenazi foetus was selected for skill in mathematics and critical-thinking skills but they base their conclusions on the efficacy of modern IQ testing and a belief in the inheritability of success on those tests – again, propositions that are still contentious and, again, best to remain agnostic about. The truth of their claims may have to wait for a millennia or two – Since the 19th century, the artificial barriers to greater Ashkenazi admixture with Gentiles have come down both in the bedroom and the workplace. If there’s truth in Ashkenazi cognitive superiority and it’s an advantageous mutation, then we can look forward to all of our descendants being just a little bit smarter.I have wavered between two and three stars for this book. This subject is of immense interest to me and defaults to the “I like” rating unless there’s some serious deficiency in the writing or argument. In the end, I’ve decided to give it 2.5 stars for two reasons: One is that it’s too short. C/H don’t give their arguments proper support and give contrary evidence short shrift, often dismissing it with a snarky, off-hand remark as illustrated in the note below. The second reason is purely an aesthetic one. I hope that it will be a passing trend but this is another mainstream book on science that adopts a faux folksy idiom totally inappropriate to the subject matter and annoying to boot.This is an interesting book and despite my caveats well worth the time to study. If nothing else, the book points up the fact that we still have an enormous amount to learn about human evolution and its role in our history – about learning who we are, who we were and who we may become. * C/H make the interesting point that New World humans may have been doubly cursed because not only were they unprepared for infectious diseases but their immune systems were fundamentally weaker than Old Worlders’ since they were descended from a single gene complex, and would explain why the complex urban, manifestly farming civilizations of the Aztecs and Inca were just as vulnerable as the unfortunate Taino of Hispaniola.** It’s unfortunate, and a serious flaw of the book, that the authors’ typical reply to counter arguments is specious. In the case of Neanderthal introgression, their response is essentially, “Humans will f**k anything”: “As for the idea that people just wouldn’t have wanted to mate with creatures that were so different, we can only say that humans are known to have had sexual congress with vacuum cleaners, inflatable dolls, horses, and the Indus river dolphin. Any port in the storm, as it were” (p. 37)."

Conventional Wisdom- scientists have long felt that the ""great leap forward"" 50,000 YA marked the end of significant biological evolution, with development of culture freeing humans from the pressures of natural selection- Stephen Jay Gould felt that 50,000 years was too short a period for significant evolution- counter examples include the change in dogs since domestication 15,000 YA, the development of corn from teosinte in 7000 years, and creosote bush specific insects over 11,000 years- over 50,000 years, human races have evolved to look quite different - some believe the changes have only been external, but there is no reason to believe that the changes are not distributed over the whole body - skeletons differ slightly among the races- HAPMAP is a database of human genetic variation with data on individuals from Nigeria, Tokyo, Beijing and European Americans- haplotypes are patterns of variation in the gene- haplotypes get shuffled in each generation - 1-3 changes per chromosome- by comparing the amount of reshuffling, the changes can be dated- overall, the rate of change over the last few thousand years is on the order of 100 times greater than over the past few million years- the authors suggest that genetic changes led to an increased ability to innovate2 - The Neanderthal Within- modern humans displaced N. in just 10,000 years - there are a number of theories as to why- one idea is that modern humans had projectile weapons, allowing smaller more efficient humans to hunt well at a lower cost- another idea is that advanced language capabilities allowed knowledge to be transferred between individuals and generations- modern humans had trade, while there is no evidence from the remains of N.- another possibility is that modern humans carried diseases that destroyed N.- the Upper Paleolithic, when modern humans displace N. 40,000 YA, shows a ""great leap forward"" in art, tools, weapons, trade and culture - a dramatic increase is evident in human ability to create and invent- the authors postulate that genetic change allowed this advancement- further, the authors postulate that the rapid genetic change was generated through introgression - the transfer of alleles from the N.- as of yet, no sign of N. genes has been found in humans- skeletal evidence of admixture is inconclusive, especially when the the possibility of convergent evolution is considered3 - Agriculture, The Big Change- agriculture led to a vast population explosion - this alone resulted in a large population pool increasing the number of genetic changes, leading to new ideas and innovation- population estimates are 0.5 M 100,000 YA (including H. erectus and N.), 6 M at the end of the ice age 10,000 YA- from the start of agriculture at 10,000 BC to AD 1, the population increased 40 - 170 times- the rise of agriculture resulted in a change from a meat diet to a carb diet- as hunters get vitamin D from meat, light skin did not arise until the rise of agriculture- populations that have not farmed or just recently moved to farming are poorly adapted to modern diet - e.g. high incidence of diabetes in aboriginal people- production of alcohol accompanied agriculture - therefore agricultural peoples are less susceptible to the adverse effects- DNA studies of N Europe show that lactose tolerance genes were not present 7000 YA, reached 25% 3000 YA, and are at 80% today4 - Consequences of Agriculture- agriculture resulted in larger, more concentrated populations - this lead to greater disease and more parasites, as transmission improved- adaptation to disease has been evolving in agricultural populations- adaptations to malaria have terrible side effects, such as sickle cell anemia - the authors postulate that this is because the adaptation is recent- the genetic changes for lactose intolerance and light skin differ between N Europe and N Asia- only in Europe is lighter skin accompanied by variety in hair and eye color- the skeletal record shows that the human skeleton has changed over the past 10,000 years, becoming more lightly built - skull volume has actually decreased by 10% from 20,000 YA - some Bronze Age skeletons (3000 YA) still had brow ridges- random musings on agriculture and the implications and effects of the move to an agrarian society5 - Gene Flow- a favorable allele can sweep through the population- in the Italian village of Limone Sulgarda, a mutation occurred that makes HDL much more effective at clearing cholesterol from arteries - the authors project that it could sweep the human population in 6000 years, assuming good mixture (the village, however, is relatively isolated) - it increased from 1 individual to 43 in 10 generations- the authors calculate that in the 400 generations since the birth of agriculture, a favorable gene (5% advantage) could move out 600 miles - however, in reality they seem to do better than that- physical barriers such as mountains and oceans slow gene flow- trade enhanced gene flow, as did colonization and conquest- the allele for blue eyes appeared 6 - 10,000 YA - the authors speculate on it's spread via the various barbaric tribes of Europe, probably the Vandals who arose in Sweden6 - Expansions- historical expansions of one group at the expense of another may have bee due to chance, but were frequently due to an advantage in terms of tools, skills or culture- when humans moved from Asia to America, 15,000 YA, they brought few diseases and parasites - America was relatively clean- HLA genes are important to the immune system - while most populations show great diversity in HLA genes, the AmerIndians do not - apparently the clean environment provided little basis for driving diversity- therefore when Europeans arrived with disease, AmerIndians were especially vulnerable- smallpox killed 30% of Europeans, but 90% of the Indian population- the opposite occurred when Europeans first went into Africa - they were devastated by tropical diseases such as malaria, sleeping sickness and yellow fever- the Indo-Europeans spread in one of the largest expansions leading to a family of languages now found in Europe, Asia and India- something is known of the I-E from the roots of the languages, but it is not known when and where they lived- the authors postulate that their success was due to the gene for lactose tolerance which allowed them to be dairymen - this provided large food supplies from a smaller land area and allowed them to be mobile- the I-E appeared to practise dominance rather than replacement of conquered societies as they made a low contribution to the European gene pool even though their language dominated- lactose tolerance arose three times - with the I-E, in the region of the upper Nile, and on the Arabian peninsula in the case of domestication of camels7 - How the Ashkenazi Jews Got Their Smarts- the AJ are essentially German Jews- the AJ have an outstanding record of achievement - this can be quantified in the sciences where they have won a disproportionate number of Nobel and other prizes - 3% of the US population, but have won 27% of the US Nobel prizes- their IQ is about 3/4 of a SD above the average European- there is no sign of exceptional intelligence in their earliest years, unlike the Greeks- the AJ eventually became traders, then moneylenders- AJ were discouraged by their religious leaders from studying ""philosophy"", emphasizing Talmudic analysis, and were isolated from areas where science was developing- the first prominent AJ scientists appear in the first half of the nineteenth century- the AJ are affected by a disproportionate number of genetic diseases- these diseases are clustered around two biological subsystems - sphingolipid storage disorders and DNA repair disorders- one possible explanation is a past population bottleneck, the results of which correspond to statistical analysis of AJ genes - however, a bottleneck would not increase a population's intelligence- the changes around sphingolipid storage may be associated with improved signal transmission in neural tissues and may case the growth of more neural connections- the mutations appear to be the result of natural selection where the prosperous AJ had more children than average, where the AJ did cognitively demanding work, and intelligence is significantly heritable- the effects of low admixture during the Middle Ages are apparent from genetic analysis - this was probably due to internal rules against intermarriage combined with external prejudiceConclusion- biological change has been a key factor driving history"
13,0465002218,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9622805-marc-brackett,5,"This was one of most interesting books that I have read in a very long time. Not only is this book most politically incorrect it also has a number of disturbing implications. One of the current most treasured beliefs in society is that we are all equal. We all know this really isn't true as some of us will become nuclear chemists, Olympic athletes, and most of us will just be average people trying to get through life. Another of the core tenants of our understanding is that genetics and environment are equal determinants when it comes to outcomes. It sounds really nice as it provides most of us the hope we can work really hard and overcome the genetic roll of the dice we started with. It however appears that our genetics play a bigger role than previously thought and that this change happens far faster. Examples of the speed with which these genetic changes can happen are shown with blue eyes (only 6,000 years old) and lactose tolerance (maybe 8,000 years old). These genes are not found in older DNA samples and gave specific advantages to the people who possessed them in certain environments. There's also evidence that just as farmers select stock best suited for the local environment and market, that societies select individuals in the same manner. Medieval kings had little tolerance for peasant uprisings or disruptive individuals, these societies require individuals that possess a certain personality. In contrast hunter/gather societies have different elements that can make an individual more successful. Some good examples would be self-control and the ability to delay self-gratification, for example rather than eating the seed wheat in the spring when the food is running short the wheat is planted instead to produce another crop. Not only is a delay in self-gratification needed, but also qualities like the ability to make long range plans and possessiveness (not sharing your wheat with neighbors). The hunter/gather individual needs a far greater fight or flight mechanism, when the elephant is killed you share and eat (otherwise it goes to waste), and there's a far greater need to make numerous short term decisions. Either set of genetics has specialized and is best suited for certain environments. Having a hair trigger that results in violent outbursts at the five star restaurant staff in Paris is different when the same energy is directed at the neighboring tribe who has invaded your tribes hunting grounds in the Amazon. In short some people have genetics that make them more suitable for what we consider civilization. The author didn't go here but Afghanistan would be an ideal place to study this (provided the researcher survived). Few places have been the recipient of such brutal and sustained warfare. There have been numerous incidents whereby the area has been depopulated by nearly 90% as the resistance encountered has required such extreme measures as part of pacifying the region. It would seem gentle subservient pacifists would fail to make much of a genetic contribution, perhaps over time contributing to the areas inability to establish a functional or modern governing structure. The book also touched on the biggest taboo of all and made a very convincing case (intelligence and genetics- in particular the intelligence of Jews). Prior to the past 700 some years the intelligence of Jews was given no special notice, aside from some religious works there was no significant Jewish intellectual contribution. The significant contributions over the past 700 some years have also been restricted to a particular tribe/group of Jews, the Ashkenazi Jews, who are associated with Europe. The Ashkenazi Jews as they migrated out of the Middle East into Europe face extreme social and economic discrimination. In nearly all cases they were banned from owning property, intermarriage with natives, and limited to practicing a few trades (finance and trade). These restrictions require some special abilities if one is going to survive, throw in the frequent pogrom and it really does become a survival of the fittest program. On average Ashkenazi Jews will score 10 points higher on IQ tests than the population they are residing with, even other Jews. It should be noted that the other Jewish populations while facing discrimination were not subjected to nearly the same restrictions and were not forced into such a narrow range of occupations, the lower trades were open to them, you could be a street sweeper and survive. Today one only has to look at the numbers to see the enormous contribution the Ashkenazi Jews have made to the world. Twenty-five percent of the Noble Prize winners are Ashkenazi Jews and are only 1/600th of the world population, still think it's a Jewish conspiracy? Half of the world chess champions are Ashkenazi Jews. More than 20% of all Ivy League college students and business CEO's are Ashkenazi Jews while representing less than 3% of the US population. There are specific genes that are unique to this population that were not present in the past. The Ashkenazi Jews also are afflicted with a number of genetic disorders which are associated with extra neurons, the gift comes with a curse. None of this is say that an Ashkenazi Jew couldn't also be a long distance runner that could outperform the Kenyans in the marathon as every population will have outliers, but it's a long shot. I think the missed underlying message in this book might be that one size will not fit all. Perhaps Germans are well suited for democracy while Afghans are not, there might be more than just culture and religion at work here. Dogs are a good comparison as they have been domesticated nearly as long as the changes in humans this book talks about. All dogs have a common ancestor- wolves. Yet there is nearly as much difference between wolves and dogs today as there is between breeds of dogs. Border collies tap into the predator instinct to control livestock (while not killing them), chihuahuas are very different (not quite sure what they do beside bark a lot), dobermans are excellent guard animals, while labs are beloved companions. Each breed has a particular use it is best suited for and very clear advantages in certain environments. No are better than the other just special and different in all the right ways. "
14,0465002218,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1879990-adam,5,"	Around this time a year ago, I was having a conversation with Shane and Alex at Beverly's house about Civilization, an ever-fertile topic. We knew that domestication had severely altered the personalities and physiologies of our plant and animal familiars. And it was axiomatic to us that agriculture had “domesticated” humans too—corn gets as much or more from us as we get from it. But was this actually genetic, or merely cultural? Or, to put it another way, if a Jurassic Park-type experiment were to clone DNA from early agricultural sites and introduce the products into society seamlessly, how would they fare? We looked for the answer, and Peter Wilson's The Domestication of the Human Species seemed promising (it treated a cultural, rather than genetic, history, however, which was disappointing). Jared Diamond's The Third Chimpanzee treated the subject only fleetingly (though it provided a host of other insights into the same subject of great interest). Apparently, and somewhat ironically, though, there was a book being written about precisely this subject at very nearly the same time we were discussing it: The 10,000 Year Explosion.	That this book needed to be written is rather odd. It makes most of its conclusions by combining two pieces of conventional wisdom in the context of a new paradigm. It was long held that, as Darwin put it, “not one of the external differences between the races of man are of any direct or special service to him.” The fact that scientists hadn't the techniques to discern genetic differences between populations, combined with racical history theory's ignoble history of, well, racism, kept legitimate investigation of the recent genetic story of the human race off the table. On the other hand, however, many genetic varations among the races are well-established and frankly, obvious. Genetic diseases like Tay-Sachs, sickle-cell anemia's evolution as an adaptation to malaria, and the various physiological adaptations to high-altitude air are good examples. Thus, most of Harpending and Cochran's work has been done for them. They seem to merely be the first ones to illustrate, in a popular context at least, the role genetic change has played in human history. 	This makes the whole book seem very familiar, and this is perhaps one reason it reads so quickly. It was noteworthy to me how many reviewers claimed to have read it in one sitting: that is not necessarily typical of 200+ page nonfiction books. It's also written in a very conversational prose, its topic is engrossing, and its arguments are put togetherly simply and elegantly (there is nothing not easily understood by the lay intellectual). I was inspired to go back to Diamond's explanation of the Great Leap Forward in the Third Chipmanzee for some context there, however. 	The book reads a lot like Diamond, and the authors quote him with some frequency. It could be an extended appendix to Guns, Germs, and Steel, telling the subplot genes had in the stories Diamond explains so well already. Diamond avoids genetics fairly assiduously, from what I remember, and GGS is in some sense the epitome of the environmental perspective's victory over the racial perspective. In this much more scientific context, history is very deterministic. The value of 10,000 Year Explosion is to reintroduce the very real role of genetic change into the deterministic story. Thus, while Cochran and Harpending's conclusions do imply that humans are not “created equal,” they realize full well that this is, just as in everything else, the fault of the environment and random chance: not any inherent value difference between the races."
15,0465002218,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4069219-wout-mertens,5,"A real eye opener. The book shows how, contrary to popular thought, humans are still evolving their genome in a process that has accelerated in the past 10,000 years instead of slowing down in the past 40,000. As a layman I was thoroughly convinced of the validity of their arguments. All the reasoning is are well-referenced. I learned very interesting things about genetics and our history, like how fast a positive mutation can become part of a population and how evolution probably shaped the European invasions of the Americas and Africa. Faults to the book are minor; I would have liked a more thorough introduction to the mechanisms in human genetics but Wikipedia helped me out on chromosomes and meiosis. Furthermore the book stops where it gets really interesting, namely present day. It would be great to read about the possible effects of modern medicine and low birthrate in the affluent/successful on our future genome. Another good subject would be the possibility of using gene therapy to apply positive mutations to live persons and/or their offspring.A very rewarding and engaging read. "
16,0465002218,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15065922-heather-fryling,1,"It started out promising. I thought I was going to get evidence that humans have, in fact, evolved over the past 10,000 years. We may have become civilized, but civilization has its own selective pressures, doesn't it? Well, I got the examples of lactose tolerance (0-90+% of Europeans in 3,000 years) and blue eyes about 6,000 year ago. Ok. So far, so good, but then the 10,000 Year Explosion went completely off the rails, starting with hypotheses based on existing facts (ok so far), then extrapolating hypotheses on top of those and continuing on a train of reasoning with slim to know factual support to arrive at... overt racism! And as an added bonus, there's a little digression into the Rousseauian notion that women should evolve to be independent, so men can live their lives without the burden of paternal investment. Guys, it's not women who would need to be independent in that scenario. It's children. And since children are not going to be independent any time soon, let's just agree that both sexes should invest in their offspring."

18,0465002218,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34731252-jonathan-sargent,4,A few throw away sections. Worth it for the last chapter alone. 
19,0465002218,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25642731-paul-r-fleischman,4,"	This book about human genetics argues for the hypothesis that human biological evolution remains important. It argues against the more popularly accepted hypothesis, championed by the late Steven Jay Gould, that “Everything we call culture and civilization we built with the same body and brain.” Gould wanted us to believe that cultural flexibility eliminated the need for biological adaptation and evolution in humans. Therefore, this book, which believes that biological evolution is continuing, or even speeding up, is argumentative, important, controversial, and stirring. 	The idea that culture has made humans so flexible that we can respond to environmental pressures at the societal and individual level, without any need for genetic selection, has become the dominant belief among social scientists and many biological scientists. That dominant belief is also comforting, since it is based upon the idea that all human gene pools form one essential entity, and that there are no important genetic group differences among us. Cochran and Harpending challenge this dominant belief system, and use a mixture of advanced genetic thinking, well thought out case studies, expansive hypothesis formation, and overgeneralization to build their case. This book is thrilling to read because its authors have the courage to take on the establishment, but this book is eerie to read because it mixes facts with probability statements, and because it opens a door to some shadowy and even dangerous innuendo. 	The chapters of this book circle around population genetics case studies, some of which convincingly show that at least some biological evolution sometimes remains important. For example, there is no question that natural selection in cold, dark environments, such as Northern Europe, led to skin color change in our African derived species that was once entirely dark skinned. Light skinned people are adaptive mutants. Similarly, there is no question that most human beings lacked the ability to digest cow’s milk, or any milk after infancy, but that the adaptive advantage of being able to absorb nutrient rich milk led to the natural selection of lactose tolerant populations where milk was available. Milk drinkers are adaptive mutants. So far so good. Why shouldn’t many other important changes in human populations rest upon natural selection of genetic advantages? It only seems common sense to anyone who has recently watched a basketball game or a football game, that genetic differences in height, weight, reflex speed, coordination, and even psychological aspects of sport like concentration, determination, are all heavily genetically based, and also show distinct population group distributions.	However, some of the other examples in this book reveal weaknesses in the authors’ central argument. For example, Cochran and Harpending write that they believe the few Neanderthal genes, that have recently been proven to exist in European populations, conferred an adaptive advantage on the people who were products of Neanderthal mating with Homo sapiens. Since when does a science book argue based upon the idea “we believe”? The authors believe that the sudden burst of innovation that followed the expansion of modern humans out of Africa was due to the genetic enrichment secondary to interbreeding, but they cannot and do not prove that this correlation in time is a causal relationship. 	In their thought-provoking chapter on agriculture, the authors argue that it not only changed our sustenance, but that it changed our characters, due to natural selection that favored deferred gratification (harvesting a crop takes a lot more time than killing an animal), patience, self control, advance planning, group cooperation, and many other changes. However, the eerie shadow of their argument is that over time agriculture increased “ant-like behavior” in people and “selection for submission to authority” that sounds “unnervingly like domestication.” The implication is that human populations may have been selected over time biologically for obedience rather than for problem solving. The authors extend their argument, (on page 127): “Science either does not exist or is appallingly feeble in the majority of the world’s populations…Science does not exist in sub-Saharan Africa or in the Islamic world today.” They further quote Pervez Hoodbhoy, a Pakistani physicist, as saying, “No major invention or discovery has emerged from the Muslim world for well over seven centuries now.” 	In what ways do these arguments rest upon proof? Are the authors providing evidence or simply scathing speculation? How do these observations refute Gould’s hypothesis that all the observable differences are culturally based? The authors of The 10,000 Year Explosion continuously imply that large-scale differences in large population groups are genetic rather than cultural, and they base their implications upon circumscribed case examples, temporal correlations and innuendo. 	In another chapter, the authors argue that the large number of Nobel prizes and other signs of high intelligence seen in Jews of Eastern European descent derived from adaptation to the conditions under which Eastern European Jews existed for a period of about 1,000 years. This chapter is based on a previous and more thoroughly scientific article that they published in The Journal of Biological Science in 2005. 	Cochran and Harpending seem to be peeking into, tiptoeing around, or implying racial and ethnic advantages, disadvantages, and differences in core biological features such as intelligence, in a manner that is daring and dangerous. Many of their arguments are subtle, and important. For example they show that an entire group does not have to genetically evolve in order for the group to nevertheless show significant advantage or disadvantage in particular traits when compared to other groups, because a small shift in the statistical mean will also create a significant shift in the tail of the normal curve, a phenomenon which they summarize as, “outliers are important.” Group advantage may not be conferred on every individual in the group, but may derive from a threshold effect at population extremes. It takes only a hundred brilliant outliers of high intelligence to create a population that will dazzle the world with one hundred new brilliant inventions or discoveries. “A modest difference in the mean of some traits can have a tremendous effect on the frequency with which members of the group exceed a high threshold…Isaac Newton, James Clerk Maxwell, and Charles Darwin made larger intellectual contributions as individuals than other entire civilizations did over a period of centuries.” Newton, Maxwell, and Darwin, all from the British Isles, radically altered human history by founding physics and biology, and they represent intellectual exceptions even within their own white, male, population base, yet they can be understood to represent a statistically probable group of outliers. However, this conjunction of talent could also be statistical artifact, like three coin tosses that all show up heads; or, better yet, it could be understood as the product of empire, power, and wealth compounded by historical situation.		 Few books have evoked in me more internal thought and argument. Because of this book, I found the issue of human genetic group differences, which had been slumbering peacefully on my mind, awakened and in tumult. The 10,000 Year Explosion, deserves and requires many readers and many critics. Review by Paul R. Fleischman author of Wonder: When and Why the World Appears Radiant.  "
20,0465002218,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5686119-book,5,"The 10,000 Year Explosion by Gregory Cochran and Henry Harpending The 10,000 Year Explosion is a fascinating book about human evolution. It's main focus is to illustrate how humans have evolved much more recently than most scientists believed. This interesting book also reveals what factors lead to human evolution. The book is composed of following seven chapters: 1. Overview: Conventional Wisdom, 2. The Neanderthal Within, 3. Agriculture: The Big Change, 4. Consequences of Agriculture, 5. Gene Flow, 6. Expansions, 7. Medieval Evolution: How the Ashkenazi Jews Got Their Smarts. Positives: 1. Fun, enjoyable, well written, interesting book about human evolution suited for the masses. 2. So much interesting knowledge throughout this wonderful book. Did you know that elephants shrank dramatically over the past 5,000 years, from an original height of 12 feet to as little as 3 feet. You do now. 3. The book provides many excellent examples of proof of recent human evolution. 4. Evolutionary genetics presented in a practical accessible manner. I'm in awe of human evolution, fascinating! 5. You don't need to believe in human evolution but you will most certainly have to accept it! 6. Great illustrations in the book. I understand you don't buy a book about evolution for the pictures but it is always refreshing to break up the monotony once in a while with a topic-appropriate illustration. 7. Some of the suggestions made in this book have actually been supported with even more concrete evidence by recent findings, such as our Neanderthal ancestry. 8. Interesting facts and tidbits about dogs. 9. The notion ""of you are what you eat""...is taken to overdrive in this book. The advent of agriculture propelled human evolution, not to mention a huge population boom. 10. It's amazing how DNA captures our ancestry. Researchers use mtDNA and Y-chromosome data to make determinations about our ancestry. Genetic history has never been this accessible. 11. I learned so much about genetics. I wish I can go back and change my major. There is a great topic on how gene flows. 12. Languages in Europe and India had a common origin, who knew? I do now. 13. Milk it does a body good... 14. Also a very interesting topic on the intellectual prominence of Ashkenazi Jews. 15. If you enjoy this book half as much as I did, you will have enjoyed it indeed. Negatives: 1. Some comments made in the book appear to be more speculative more than scientific. As an example, I find the notion that many scientists believe that human evolution has come to a halt, too speculative with no real data to substantiate it. Socially caused evolution also appears to be somewhat speculative in spite of the fact that I tend to agree with the hypothesis. More scientific backing would be warranted. In summary, ""The 10,000 Year Explosion"" is an excellent, accessible book for the human evolutionist, in all of us. I thoroughly enjoyed the book, it was fun and educational. I also recommend the following books on evolution: ""Why Evolution Is True"" by Jerry Coyne (my favorite book on this topic), ""Your Inner Fish..."" by Neil Shubin, ""The Making of the Fittest"" by Sean B. Carroll, ""What Evolution Is"" by Ernst Mayr, ""Life Ascending: The Ten Great Inventions of Evolution"" by Nick Lane and of course you have your pick of books from the master Richard Dawkins his most recent book on evolution is ""The Greatest Show on Earth"".

It would have been easily 5 stars for the information in the book, but the writing style really gets in the way. Snarky judgements and comments throughout the book, I'm guessing to make the book more accessible to a broader audience, for me just put the authors' scholarship into question. This weakened their theories and arguments. It's a shame because these comments were such a small part of the text. The book would have been greatly improved by better judgement on the editor's part.That said, the theories presented here are incredibly important to our current world view as a species. I think most people are under the impression that human beings are the pinnacle of evolution and that we're done evolving. This book gives good argument that our evolution continues as I write this. Our fossil record shows the massive changes that occur over time, but not the small incremental changes that occur to get to those massive changes. It made me think about what it is that puts organisms into a different sub-species and I found it can be significant (not necessarily large) physical changes or behavioral changes, like the differences in behavior from one type of honeybee to another. If we expand that thought to human beings we start to see the potential for two or more different sub-species of human beings operating in the world today. Could human beings who work and support the behavior found in large corporations be another sub-species of Homo Sapiens that operate in a hive-like environment created by them? Before you answer this question, check out Michael O'Malley's The Wisdom Of Bees: What the Hive Can Teach Business About Leadership. Efficiency and Growth.This book will really get you thinking about the world we live in and how we're adapting to it. It made me think about whether ADD is an illness or simply an adaptation to our faster and faster paced media barrage. In just 60 years we've gone from television with three channels and radio to having thousands of channels, the internet, radio, sound bites, multiple viewing devices, video billboards, cell phones and text messaging. Does it seem unreasonable to think we'd be adapting to these changes in our environment? And if we accept ADD as a natural adaptation to this environment, what would it mean we would have to do in handling ADD? Maybe it would mean we'd have to develop methods of teaching that would enhance and utilize the ADD adaptation for for learning rather than drug everyone into thinking the way we did 100 years ago so our schools will still work. I'm no expert on any of these subjects, but it does seem to be something we need to look at."
22,0465002218,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28672441-dave-schoettinger,3,"In the late nineteenth century, Darwin's thoughts on evolution were appropriated by many to show that the evolution of homo sapiens had resulted in the ascendancy of white peoples. This ""scientific"" evidence of white superiority was used to justify all types of outrages committed against ""less evolved"" forms of humans. The scientific community, horrified by the misuse of evolution, stressed that homo sapiens were all the same and race was not a means of ranking people. To support this position, many asserted that human evolution had more or less halted prior to racial differentiation. The authors, two U of U anthropology professors, looked at the evidence and decided that not only had human evolution not stopped, but that it was picking up speed, largely because of the large increase in population and therefore increased number of random mutations that might impact the species. They are not preaching eugenics or white supremacy, but they do point out that certain genetic traits do give an advantage to their possessors in certain situations and that those genes are therefore more likely to be passed on. Most of the genes they discuss have to do with disease resistance or lactose tolerance. Somewhere out there may be a crackpot who will interpret this book to mean that goat-milk drinkers are responsible for all human progress and therefore should be ruling the world. However, I would hope that, as a species, we have put such insanity behind us and can appreciate the authors' observations as a contribution to their discipline. "
23,0465002218,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10458945-sarah,1,"This book was really promising at first and the subject is very interesting. I was really impressed in the first chapter and then it went downhill. The writing is accessible, however leaves a bit to be desired when the author inserts snarky comments at inappropriate times. I was also unimpressed by the lack of detail when talking about the historical context of genetic development. Obviously history is complicated and nuanced, but the lack of detail and the brief overview of various periods was frustrating. Additionally, the assertion that one group has superior intellectual abilities is problematic no matter what, if any “scientific” backing there is. I would say take this work with a grain of salt. "
24,0465002218,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14115149-jaclynn,3,"I enjoyed it because of the occasional tidbit mentioned that I hadn't heard of before but it's very basic and lacks sufficient citations and evidence for the less modest claims. Lactose tolerance (0-90+% of Europeans in 3,000 years) and blue eyes about 6,000 year ago, great! Then towards the end it went off the rails. Take it with a grain of salt and read it for a different perspective but don't necessarily believe everything presented."

26,0465002218,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1211747-lisa,2,"As a book written for the layman about new ideas in genetic research, _The 10,000 Year Explosion_ is an important book. Gregory Cochran and Henry Harpending, two professors at the University of Utah (physics and genetics, respectively), are basically saying in their theories that it is our genetic make up that determined our ancestors' fate, and it will determine ours too.While I accept that different races are composed differently of genetic codes, resulting in different eye and skin colors and responses to different foods, etc. (for example, as an Asian, it is not unusual for me to be lactose-intolerant), I don't find it useful to think that any race is genetically pre-determined to have a higher IQ than others. Cochran and Harpending are saying that culture and education do not matter, as we are pre-programmed by our genes. This is profoundly dangerous and grim, as it may lead us back to destructive racism.When used properly, we can apply our new knowledge of genetics research constructively to help create proper medical treatment for personalized medicine that would be most suitable for each individual. But taken the wrong way, this information can potentially harm any specific race. I find that much of the book is unsubstantiated theory that would be impossible to prove or disprove directly because it would simply be too unethical to carry out such experiments. Too much is being attributed to genetics. What bothers me most about this book is the way it is written. I feel that the two professors are so in love with their own theories that they are not heeding the responsibility they have to humanity. I can't help but think of the Puritan idea of predestination as I read this book. They're saying that you're screwed because you're born this way. Your children may mutate though."
27,0465002218,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5719372-scott-waldyn,3,"This is alien territory for me, as I know minimal about genetics or anthropology. However, I did find this book interesting in the way that it looks at the construction of modern civilization, the roads leading to where we are now, through a lens of genetic evolution and acquiring traits necessary to climb the next rung. While this book seems more in the realm of anthropology rather than genetics, the theories posited are interesting and do lean into the authors' argument that we have been evolving more than we think we have. I imagine more testing and research would be needed to test this theory, but this case has a very enticing foundation.That said, I echo the sentiments of other readers when it comes to the Ashkenazi chapter. It's discomforting and runs parallel to barbarous historical precedents with regard to isolating a group in this manner."
28,0465002218,http://goodreads.com/user/show/455531-colin,1,"This was one of the worst things I have ever read. It was actually painful to finish, but I did make it through. I think the only decent part of this book is the title. First off, this book is horribly written. To me the entire book reads like a bunch of badly connected and poorly written undergraduate essays. As others have pointed out, this book is also very schizophrenic in its inability to decide whether it should be too simplistic or overly detail oriented. The authors also do not appear to understand how an argument works. In general, if you want to explain why you are correct and someone else is wrong, you first say their idea, then why it is incorrect and then your idea and why it is the right one. None of the arguments in this are formulated correctly. It seems as if they generally decided to use phrases like ""simply incorrect"" in regards to others and ""completely obvious"" to their point of view, without ANY evidence for either. Throughout the book the authors state that conventional wisdom is that humans stopped evolving some 40,000-50,000 years ago and that they are some of the first to say otherwise. This is untrue. I suspect they are mostly referring to Jared Diamond (who isn't actually an Anthropologist or Evolutionary Biologist) and a small quote from Stephen Jay Gould in regards to this statement. In fact, this is not the conventional wisdom of the scientific community and there are MANY papers, books and people who say that we are still evolving by a combination of culture AND biology. Of course none of these are referenced in this book. Most of the book is speculation and theory without any REAL evidence, although it does exist but if they used any of those sources they would have to acknowledge that this is not an original work. I think another HUGE gripe I have with this book is that NONE of the evidence throughout the book is from the authors. The only time they use their own work is at the very end. Before moving on to this next paragraph, I must stress that I am not anti-Semitic. I am not a believer in eugenics in any way, shape or form. That being said this brings me to my next point, which is what I believe this book was written for. The last chapter is about how European Jews (Ashkenazi Jews) are more evolved and smarter then EVERYONE else in the world. The main evidence for this? They score higher on IQ tests. IQ tests are known to be biased, and saying ""look they have higher IQ scores and these are some theories (without evidence) as to why"" is not science. The entire chapter is written like a pro Jewish eugenics argument, about how everyone else is genetically inferior to them. This is the kind of thinking used to support racist arguments all the time, and is exactly opposite of what the Nazi's used during the Holocaust. This is not okay. The authors flat out say that those of Middle Eastern, African and other decent are genetically inferior. They even say that European Jews are better than any other Jews. There are going to be vast IQ differences between many small groups, throughout the world. The IQ of a group, however, does not place them higher on the geneticsOverall this is an unscientific piece of rubbish, and is frankly not even worth the paper it's printed on. It can't even be called ""pop science"". In this day and age, no one who thinks of themselves as an Anthropologist or scientist (of any kind) should actively suggest that one group is genetically superior to another. This is what lead to institutionalized slavery, genocide, and the ongoing hatred of women, homosexuals, Jews, Muslims, people of African descent, and any other minority group. The authors, publisher, and the editor should be ashamed of themselves for clouding the minds of their readers and feebly attempting to pass this off as legitimate science.  "

30,0465002218,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19773041-joseph-hirsch,3,"Depending on a whole host of factors (your scientific background, religion, personal experiences, and biases, to name a few) one could come away from ""The 10,000 Year Explosion"" thinking that anthropologist Greg Cochran is an intellectually voracious man who wants to know where and how humans differ in their genes in order to cure diseases and increase social harmony, or conversely, that he is a latter-day Cesare Lombroso who wants to bust out the calipers to measure our heads to find out which of us have seed worth saving for his eugenic experiments and which of us need to undergo forced sterilization.Having read his ""10,000 Year Explosion"" written by Cochran in conjunction with geneticist Henry Harpending, I found the authors to be intelligent, humorous men capable of explaining very, very complicated concepts in a way that did not scare off this layman. The problem I had with the book was not some kind of moral objection (science doesn't care about my feelings) but rather the nagging sense that this was a paper or presentation stretched out to book length, and that any one of the ideas explicated in the book in one chapter would have made a great book in itself. Dr (?) Cochran cites Jared Diamond's ""Guns, Germs, and Steel"" multiple times throughout the book; I just wish he'd taken the same sort of ""deep dive"" approach to this book in terms of its structure and breadth. In brief (and it's hard to be brief with this information) Cochran argues that human evolution did not stop roughly 40,000 years ago as many believe, and that evolution is an ongoing process, and that this process can ""explode"" in a very local and idiosyncratic way, based on everything from rigorous man-made laws (especially regarding things like out-marriage) to civic arrangements (one of the more disturbing but fascinating detours in the book holds that once humans shifted from hunter-gatherers to agrarians, we started to favor the conforming and even servile over the independent and strong).Someone, in an attempt to summarize this book, called it something like an exploration of history through the lens of genetics, which would be a pretty good capitulation. The authors take the reader from ancient Asian Steppes where Mongol hordes perfected a simple but effective reproduction strategy (kill the men and mate with the women), all the way forward in time to an Israeli hospital in the twenty-first, where the idea that genetic advantages can become disadvantages or can even be made irrelevant is explored. As previously mentioned, all of the subjects dealt with are fascinating, and presented in a clear manner. But it's a bit too thumbnail for my taste. Your take might differ. I'd certainly take a class with Dr. Cochran, though, if I were still in college. I imagine it would be easy to stay awake during his seminars. "
31,0465002218,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32156837-mike,5,"This is a fascinating book on the mutual influence of genes on culture and of culture on genes. The ""explosion"" referred to in the title was the advent of agriculture, which greatly multiplied the size of the human population, greatly altered culture, and redirected human evolution down new paths to adapt to this new culture. When human population increased the rate of genetic mutations increased correspondingly, which increased the rate of evolution (by 100 fold according to the authors). Humans, especially those in densely populated areas, have been evolving rapidly in the last 10,000 years--and their evolution is driven by their environment, including their culture. But, then, newly evolved humans, being different from their ancestors, develop different cultural environments more suitable to their nature. Thus, evolution and human culture form a feedback loop. Of course, in a world of relatively isolated regional and local populations, their will be different natural/cultural environments, hence differential evolution to adapt to them. Inuit amidst ice flows and tundra would not (and did not) evolve the same way as Melanesians on their tropical islands. And evolution may proceed quite rapidly under certain circumstances, particularly large population size and major environmental impetus. On top of well supported scientific theory, the authors add numerous examples of evolution-culture interaction throughout history. It's an important new perspective on history. The style of writing is clear, needless academic jargon wisely jettisoned. The historical examples that run through the book seem somewhat arbitrarily chosen, but, this being a relatively new field of inquiry, the authors are probably just following the trail of such evidence as we currently have. The newness also means we face some uncertainties of interpretation. The authors note evidential limitations when present, but are bold to cast forth their nets in some clever speculations, one of which has been confirmed since publication (non-African humans have some Neanderthal DNA). This is what scientists do and are meant to do when faced with uncertainty: formulate hypotheses, preferably intelligent, informed ones. In this book, we have something of a hybrid beast: a populist approach with some vanguard hypothesizing. "
32,0465002218,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5466619-naftoli,5,"This book has opened my eyes to so many issues; to say that it is transformative is understatement. I had been taught in college that human evolution stopped with the advent of culture, that culture made adjustments to the environment thus eliminating the need for biology to fine tune our bodies. I had also been trained to view IQ tests as simply racist tools used by white patriarchal society to convince the priveleged that minority people are inferior - it sounds hyperbolic but I was actually told this by professors! I had also been taught that all humans are essentially the same (one world, one people, that race is only skin deep). When confronted with differences in intelligence, adaptability, etc. I was taught that this is due to political inequities, war, in short, culture. This book challenges these biases. I will no doubt read this book again at some later date and refer to it from time to time. I am not trained as a scientist so I will have to review and re-review the data from time to time. I was trained as a social scientist - cultural anthropology - so I am the target audience for this book. The issue regarding Neanderthals and what became of them is one of the first issues undertaken in this work; I found it to be both realistic and reasonable. The authors rely on population genetics, mathematics, extrapolations, &c in an effort to buttress their position that modern humans have inherited a small but important percentage of Neanderthal genetic material. It makes sense to me.Among so many things, I admire the authors for having the courage to challenge our current received wisdom. It seems to me that they have taken quite a risk in doing so as there is nothing 'politically correct' about this book. The authors even point to data that most writers shy away from as it may cast them in a negative light. Whatever the reason for shying away from data, it is vital that we humans look facts straight in the face and deal with the realities of our evolution, our cultural wisdom and ethnocentricities, and our impact upon this planet. At the minimum, debate these issues rather than labeling and dismissing them. This book tackles a few of these issues."
33,0465002218,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4534780-alina,5,"The old thinking is that, when cultural evolution took off, biological evolution stopped -- because instead of being shaped by our environment, we began shaping our environment to us. That idea always seemed reasonable to me, but this book has changed my mind. The authors contend that, on the contrary, evolution has sped up since the neolithic revolution. The social innovations associated with agriculture and civilization mean we have subjected ourselves to major new environmental pressures, and that has fueled rapid natural selection. Their idea is that cultural evolution interacts with biological evolution; the two drive each other. One of the book's points is that natural selection isn't as slow as is often believed, since altering just one gene or even one nucleotide can sometimes result in important advantages. By examining evidence from the exploding field of population genetics, as well as other sources, the authors find indications of significant biological change in the past 10,000 years or so. Examples include differing disease resistance in response to local conditions, the development of lactose tolerance in dairy farmers, and selection for higher intelligence among Ashkenazi Jews. Although I'd heard of some of these things before, I hadn't appreciated the impact on history. The authors make a convincing case that genetic factors can be decisive. I no longer think of biological evolution as something that stopped being important once modern humans came into existence."

那么为何德系犹太人特别聪慧呢？想要解答这个谜题，或许我们可以看看关于阿什肯纳兹犹太人的DNA我们都知道些什么，因为事实证明它们还有另一个有趣的特征。即，它们有一组不常见的严重遗传病，例如家族性黑蒙性痴呆症、高雪氏病、家族性自主神经功能异常，以及两种不同形式的遗传性乳腺癌（BRCA1和BRCA2），这些疾病在阿什肯纳兹犹太人群体中的发病率比在其他欧洲人群中高将近100倍。我们相信这两个谜题有单一的解释。我们认为阿什肯纳兹犹太人在北欧逗留的时期在白领职业的自然选择中获得了成功，而这成功源自他们智力上的遗传优势。但对于智力的强势选择也产生了一些让人不愉快的副作用：提高遗传携带者智商的等位基因同时也对纯合体产生损害。这一类解释自然是有争议的。事实上很多人排斥这一类说法：智力是可测量的，由遗传决定的，不同的人类群体间有智力上的差异。有趣的是，这些批评和斥责甚少来自从事认知测试及其结果分析的科学工作者。业内对此很少或几乎没有任何争议，智商测试是准确的，测试结果能预测学术成就和个体生活的其他方面，而且智商值有极高的遗传率。如果遗传的确能影响智力，那么一段时间后，智力带来的繁殖优势必然会带来更高的智力。这个简单的逻辑是关于自然选择的演化理论的核心：能增加繁殖的基因在人类群体中会随时间推移变得越来越常见。.................我们认为印欧扩张起始于乳糖耐受突变的频率增高，当其频率增高至足以使整个人群转型从事制乳业经济的时候，印欧人就迅速扩散至整个南俄大草原。这迅速的扩张就有可能导致说近似语言的同一人群分散在从当今的乌克兰直到乌拉尔河地区这一广阔区域。因为扩张如此迅速，语言还没有分化，所以这一广大区域中分散的人群说的还是相似的语言。印欧人前进的步伐持续至进入欧洲，在那里制乳业在生态学效应上足以跟早期农业竞争，而且前者催生了一种远远更具侵略性的文化。印欧文化很可能是更好战的，因为印欧人群的高机动性、更多的人口数量和更好的营养使他们能比其他人群更经常赢得战争。而他们的胜利反过来又会提升他们的军事行动效率，从而成功哺育了更多成功。从印欧人基因在欧洲基因库占的相对低的比例来看，他们似乎实行的是精英统治，做被征服人群的统治者但没有摧毁或替代原先的居住者。然而相对小的精英人口常常能够让所有其余人口说他们的语言。此外，印欧人还把乳糖耐受的等位基因加进了本地的混合基因库。乳糖耐受突变在印欧人入侵前的欧洲很罕见或根本不存在，然而当制乳业受自然选择青睐的时候，它就在欧洲变得很常见了，特别是在北欧。[20]印欧语言和文化在制乳业流行的地域传播扩散，比方说，它们还进入了南欧和伊朗，然而中东的强势国家们似乎阻止了这些语言文化进入中东。我们认为印欧扩张起始于乳糖耐受突变的频率增高，当其频率增高至足以使整个人群转型从事制乳业经济的时候，印欧人就迅速扩散至整个南俄大草原。这迅速的扩张就有可能导致说近似语言的同一人群分散在从当今的乌克兰直到乌拉尔河地区这一广阔区域。因为扩张如此迅速，语言还没有分化，所以这一广大区域中分散的人群说的还是相似的语言。印欧人前进的步伐持续至进入欧洲，在那里制乳业在生态学效应上足以跟早期农业竞争，而且前者催生了一种远远更具侵略性的文化。印欧文化很可能是更好战的，因为印欧人群的高机动性、更多的人口数量和更好的营养使他们能比其他人群更经常赢得战争。而他们的胜利反过来又会提升他们的军事行动效率，从而成功哺育了更多成功。从印欧人基因在欧洲基因库占的相对低的比例来看，他们似乎实行的是精英统治，做被征服人群的统治者但没有摧毁或替代原先的居住者。然而相对小的精英人口常常能够让所有其余人口说他们的语言。此外，印欧人还把乳糖耐受的等位基因加进了本地的混合基因库。乳糖耐受突变在印欧人入侵前的欧洲很罕见或根本不存在，然而当制乳业受自然选择青睐的时候，它就在欧洲变得很常见了，特别是在北欧。[20]印欧语言和文化在制乳业流行的地域传播扩散，比方说，它们还进入了南欧和伊朗，然而中东的强势国家们似乎阻止了这些语言文化进入中东。.......一开始他们是作为基督教与穆斯林世界的中介的国际商人。然而随着穆斯林和基督徒（特别是意大利人）逐渐开始直接通商，阿什肯纳兹犹太商人越来越多地开始从事本地贸易。当对犹太人的迫害越来越严重从而长距离旅行无法得到安全保障之后，德系犹太人越来越专注于金融业，这个行业对他们是敞开的，因为基督徒被禁止放高利贷。在公元1100年前绝大部分德系犹太人都是放贷者，这一模式延续了几个世纪。[15]这些职业（交易和金融业）有很高的智商需求，我们可以肯定没有其他人类群体有这么高数量比例的人口在长时段内从事需要很高认知能力的职业。有时我们能找到相当详尽的阿什肯纳兹犹太人的商业活动记录。比如关于南法鲁西永犹太人在约公元1270年就有这样的记录：“有全面证据证明这群犹太人以放贷为生，实质上完全没有从事任何其他种类的经济活动。有记录的228名男性犹太人中近八成在向他们的基督教邻居放贷。犹太女人（几乎都是寡妇）放贷的也很常见，这些来自弱势者的资本被投资到相似的渠道。并且最积极从事放贷的犹太人似乎在他们的群体内是最受尊崇的。................他们曾是波兰立陶宛王国的管理者阶层。除了读写能力之外，在这些特定职业上取得成功所依靠的是类似于现今商人的素质，至少也需要有追踪复杂交易和资金流动的能力。最终，随着波兰立陶宛王国的阿什肯纳兹犹太人人口数量上升，越来越多的犹太人成了手工艺者——毕竟对管理和金融职业的需求也是有一定限度的。然而在800到900年的时间段内，也就是大致从公元800年到公元1650或1700年，绝大部分的阿什肯纳兹犹太人从事的是管理和金融业，也就是复杂度很高的职业，他们几乎从来不当农民和匠人。在这个方面他们和所有其他定居人口都有所不同。事实上，在那个时代任何占有领地的人类族群都不可能有那么高比例的人口从事白领职业，因为这样农业生产率就会过低。九成的人口都必须务农，从而生产足够的粮食去养活他们自己和社会顶层少量的统治者、文员、士兵、匠人以及商人。对白领职业的自然选择只有在这一阶层独自成为一个族群的时候才有可能成功，这一族群必须靠职业而非其据地而界定。在高复杂度职业中取得成功的犹太人享有更高的遗传优势。学者怀里波说：“在富裕的家庭中有更多的孩子能活到成年。总体上属于更富裕阶层的许多商业领袖、显赫拉比、群体领袖和类似个体的谱系显示，这些人通常有4个、6个甚至8～9个孩子活到成年。........智商有很高的可遗传性。这意味着一个个体的智商值会部分取决于遗传影响，从而更接近他或她的父母和兄弟姐妹而不是随便哪个别人。同一对父母生下的子女即便在不同环境下养大也会有相近的智商值，而领养的兄弟姐妹即便在同一屋檐下长大也不会有相近的智商值。高度也是类似的：长得高的人更可能有高于平均身高的子女。事实上，成年人的智商值与身高一样主要受遗传因素影响。然而童年的智商值却受遗传影响更少，而更容易受周围环境影响。周围环境对儿童智商测试结果的影响会在青春期期间或其后消失，这成了美国先锋计划（Head

Program）的基础，即宣扬智商值能因一定干预而提高。非遗传因素同样会影响智商值，但很多情况下那些起作用的因素都不是人们想象会起作用的因素。父母关爱、母乳喂养、营养情况、早教、子宫中听莫扎特音乐和燕麦麸几乎都没起什么作用。而让人惊讶的是，一个家庭养育孩子的方式看起来对孩子成年时的智商值没有任何影响。这有效地反驳了一些流行的环境决定论——它们对阿什肯纳兹犹太人的高智商做各种成长环境方面的解释，尤其反驳了那些认为犹太母亲用特殊的方式抚养孩子催发了他们的高智商的论调。...在阿什肯纳兹犹太人特别高发的遗传病中，广为人知的是家族性黑蒙性痴呆症、高雪氏病和BRCA1与BRCA2乳腺癌突变，但同时还有许多其他的疾病，比如尼曼匹克症、卡纳万病和家族性自主神经功能异常。有些会引起神经方面的问题。它们在阿什肯纳兹犹太人身上特别高发，这已经成了人类遗传学上一个长久的谜题。.....是什么样的性征在阿什肯纳兹犹太人身上比在他们的邻居身上更宝贵呢？嗯，我们有一些很强的线索。是什么性征在当今的德系犹太人身上最突出呢？他们是壮大如萨摩亚人，高如图西族人，以及牛奶耐受如荷兰人吗？不是的，他们的特殊性征就是智力。这些突变体本身就提示了这一点：它们中的一些看起来就很像会提高智商的，考虑到它们作用于中枢神经系统的发展。鞘脂类突变体特别有可能具有提升智力的作用。在每一种这类突变体中，都有一些特定鞘脂累积；这些鞘脂是变更过的脂类分子，它们在信号传输中起作用，并在神经组织中特别常见。研究者已经确定这些鞘脂类作用水平的提升会引致神经元（中枢神经系统的基本细胞）之间更多的连接（高雪氏病的轴突生长）。在家族性黑蒙性痴呆症的情形中有相似的效应：特定的累积混合物（GM2神经节苷脂）作用水平提升会促进树突（连接神经元的纤细多分支突起）的增长。[41]这种树突生成的增加现象也同样发生在A型尼曼匹克细胞出现、动物版黑蒙性痴呆症和尼曼匹克病的情形下。这些都是已知的疾病等位基因中唯一能引致神经连接增加的因素。我们同时还有（并不确凿的）证据证明德系犹太人身上常见的一些基因变异有可能提升智力。我们研究了耶路撒冷高雪氏病患者的职业——实际上是所有在耶路撒冷沙尔泽德克医学中心（Shaare Zedek Medical Centre）治疗的患者。这些患者成为工程师或科学家的概率比以色列阿什肯纳兹犹太人从事这些职业的平均概率要高很多，事实上大概要高11倍。[42]关于阿什肯纳兹犹太人的另一种遗传病扭转性肌张力障碍也有类似的研究结果。这种遗传病最初被诊断出来的时候，研究者就已经开始注意到其患者不同寻常的智力水平。.....结论文化革新在很长的时间里都是人类生物学变化的驱动力，在约250万年前人类开始使用工具之后就一直如此。自然选择青睐那些从事早期文化革新的原始人类大脑，而这些革新本身就导向更多身体和心理上的变化。生物学特征和文化特征的协同演化一开始是很缓慢的，至少以现代标准看是慢的，但渐渐演化速度就快起来了。考古学记录显示我们的革新能力持续上升，直至约4万年前，我们已经为所谓的“人类革命”或旧石器时代晚期欧洲和亚洲北部的“创造性大爆发”蓄势待发。技术和艺术的突然兴盛发生在人类扩张并走出非洲的不久以后；它同时也跟生物学变化有关，而我们猜想这些生物学变化部分是由从尼安德特人或其他远古人类（亚洲大陆更早的占据者）身上偷得的基因驱动的。行为现代化导致更多的变化：人类制作更精良的工具，然后他们在数代人的时间里也反过来被这些工具不断塑造变化。农业出现之后，文化和生物演化都加速了，因为新的生活方式使人们有了新的需求。农业出现以前人类一直都是觅食者：农业带来的人口急剧增加使得更多有益的变异体出现，也使得更多新想法出现。我们人类在农业传播后的快速演化的确是一万年的爆发。 这爆发如今还在持续：人类演化并没有止步于解剖学意义上的现代人类出现，或他们扩张走出非洲的时候。它从来没有停止。而且它怎么会停下呢？演化停滞需要一个静滞的环境，而行为现代化一直带来的都是革新和变化。一直以来我们都不曾有稳定和静滞的环境。这一点应该是很明显的，然而人类科学不仅忽视了它，相反还一直在一个奇怪的前提下辛勤地做研究，这个奇怪的想法认为演化在4万年前就停止了。 所有这些都意味着也必然意味着，生物变化是驱动历史的重要因素。当然它不是唯一的因素，而且很奇怪的是，它还被与更传统的影响绑定在一起。诸如乳糖耐受一类的遗传变化的出现和传播是文化革新（例如农业的发展）的结果，它同时也源自随机出现的合适的突变。这些遗传变化反过来也对文化产生了影响。印欧人的扩张，欧洲人在北美和澳大利亚的成功定居，“瓜分非洲”的失败，阿什肯纳兹犹太人进入智力舞台，甚至有可能工业革命和科学的兴起，所有这些看来都是生物和文化变化之永恒的舞步所营造的。 如果人类科学的研究者们继续忽略自然选择从未停止作用这一事实，他们就会把许多重要问题的解答线索给丢掉，把谜题变成秘密。科尔特斯带着500人就征服并控制了几百万人的帝国。想要解释这件事情而不提持续演化带来的疾病抵御机制中的生物学差异，这完全不可能。公元前5世纪的修昔底德说人类特征是不会变化的，所以可以预测，而当今许多科学家相信人类特征几万年前就停止了改变。历史学家们似乎一直以此为研究的前提。然而这样一来他们就忽略了巨大的契机，不仅在于解读人类的往昔，而且也在于塑造未来。贯穿人类历史的持续演化一直是一个巨大的自然界的实验，这个实验承诺了我们在理解自身、抵御疾病和精神病症方面的巨大的成果。利莫内苏尔加尔达隐藏着关于人类疾病的一个重要线索。世界上大概有100万个这样的小村庄，一定有更多类似的线索等待我们去发现。人类历史为我们展现的一些实验的成果甚至有可能帮助我们进行更有野心的尝试，去增加人类寿命和认知能力。从事人类科学的学者们是时候去甩掉一系列关于演化停止和“心理均一”的僵化教条了。每一刻时间都很宝贵，我们有一整个世界要去争取呢。"
35,0465002218,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16831597-fran-globlek,4,"The authors manage to spoil many thought-provoking observations with a careless approach to logic and underwhelming scientific rigour. I will give it 4/5 on account of me enjoying the ideas. These ideas, however, convince me to the extent of them ""making sense"". As a scientist I do expect much more in order to be convinced. I understand that this would make the book significantly longer and it might not necessarily be aimed for the ""general public"", but I would argue that here we don't really see the case of oversimplification being the issue, since the ideas, terminology, methodology described etc. are not necessarily ""dumbed down"". Instead, there is a certain haughty attitude - judging by this book alone, everybody other than the authors thinks genetic changes in human beings stopped 40,000 years ago and is wholly dogmatic. "
36,0465002218,http://goodreads.com/user/show/77887124-paul-clark,1,"This book rejects the view that race is primarily a social construct and proposes five hypotheses about genetic differences between ethnic groups. The first two, lactose tolerance and resistance to pathogens, are physiological and uncontroversial. The same cannot be said of the other three: that interbreeding between Eurasians and Neanderthals increased Eurasian intelligence, that long-term exposure to agriculture leads to a greater predisposition to the ‘bourgeois’ values of hard work and restraint, and that medieval restrictions on Ashkenazi Jews raised their intelligence. This review will focus on these three hypotheses.THE NEANDERTHAL ADVANTAGEHomo sapiens first encountered Neanderthals after leaving Africa 40,000 years ago. Cochran and Harpending speculate that interbreeding between the two species raised Eurasian intelligence, triggering the Upper Palaeolithic revolution in technology, symbolic behaviour and socio-economic organisation. Quite how sub-Saharan Africans later managed the same transition to modern behaviour without the benefit of Neanderthal DNA, the authors do not say.In any case, many archaeologists favour non-genetic explanations for the transition. Others argue that it occurred in Africa much earlier, citing discoveries like a large 70,000 year-old settlement in Sudan and sophisticated 44,000 year-old southern African artefacts. If critics of the Upper Palaeolithic model turn out to be correct, Cochran and Harpending’s highly speculative hypothesis would be falsified.THE AGRICULTURAL REVOLUTION AND BOURGEOIS VALUESThe authors claim that the development of agriculture led to the spread of genes for hard work and restraint among those populations in the Middle East, East Asia and Europe that have been exposed to agriculture for longest.Whilst superficially convincing, their account has serious flaws. The most glaring is the claim that ADHD has been bred out of China, where it actually affects up to 5% of schoolchildren. Other claims presented as facts are in reality matters of dispute. Agriculture might have arisen in sub-Saharan Africa 1,000 years earlier than the authors state, and their claim that Australian Aborigines never developed agriculture is contested.In most pre-capitalist societies, hard work did not have the significance the authors give it because any attempt to rise above your station was seen as sinful and peasants generally did as little work as they could get away with. The way people accumulated wealth was to squeeze it out of someone else as a warlord, a landlord or the holder of a sinecure that enabled them to milk others.Traders who acquired wealth through hard work dreamed of turning it into land, finding an impoverished noble family to marry into and putting their feet up. The only ones unable to do this were religious minorities like Armenians, Jews, Lebanese and Parsees. Cochran and Harpending claim that bourgeois genes made these communities successful middlemen when in fact it was their minority religion that trapped them in this niche.Similarly dubious is the claim that a lack of bourgeois genes fuels opposition to neo-liberalism in Latin America. Surely the growth of the industrial working class is a better explanation for the influence of socialism there.The authors contrast farmers who refrain from eating their seed corn with hunter gatherers who scupper efforts to turn them into herders by eating all their goats. But are hunter gatherers really so stupid? Or is this a case of a top-down innovation deliberately sabotaged by a community that never wanted it?The claim that aggression has been bred out of those populations longest exposed to agriculture is undermined by Cohen and Nisbett’s famous study that found startling differences in levels of aggression between genetically indistinguishable people from different cultures.THE INTELLIGENCE OF AHKANAZI JEWSCochran and Harpending’s third controversial hypothesis concerns the high IQs of Ashkenazi Jews, allegedly 12-15 points above other Europeans. They favour the theory that this is genetically determined because medieval north European Jews were restricted to white-collar occupations, particularly money lending, in which only intelligent people could succeed, giving them greater reproductive success in a community where marrying out was forbidden.However, the data they present is superficial. The influence of heritability on IQ shifts during a person’s life, rising dramatically as children grow to adulthood. But the authors never give the ages of the people in their statistics, making them impossible to assess.Their claim that 80% of economically active medieval Ashkenazim were full-time moneylenders is unconvincing, since Jews were confined to ghettoes with separate micro-economies, and rules forbidding the ‘improper subordination’ of Christians by Jews would probably have created the need for a Jewish servant class.Despite these caveats, this hypothesis is credible if unproven. There is no a priori reason why the heritable intelligence of every ethnic group should be the same and the Ashkenazim are a genetically closed community with a unique history.CONCLUSIONSThe 10,000 Year Explosion makes noteworthy points about physiological differences between the races and asks an interesting question about the intelligence of Ashkenazi Jews without quite supplying the answer. But it has conspicuously failed to demonstrate any other link between race and either intelligence or character. Cochran and Harpending’s Neanderthal hypothesis is highly speculative, and their claims about bourgeois values and agriculture rest on questionable evidence and a willingness to ignore simpler and more obvious explanations.Please see my website for a longer and fully sourced version of this review."
37,0465002218,http://goodreads.com/user/show/84499280-david-baer,4,"I got worried reading the introduction, because (among many others) they thanked Phil Rushton, who I remember from a lifetime ago as being in the news in a bad way, as in using his research to either promote or implicitly support racist ideologies. But I continued anyway, because I find the subject matter fascinating.Because, as I opined in my review of Before the Dawn: Recovering the Lost History of Our Ancestors, it's not by definition racist to inquire into the genetic basis of racial variation - it's only racist if you use such inquiry to justify privilege for one group, or even to consider one group as inherently superior to another. So, for example, it's not racist to find the genetic basis for why Kenyans are so successful at long-distance running. It is racist to conclude from that fact, that, I don't know, say, ""driving while black"" isn't really a thing. Or that separation of the ""races"" is a good thing, etc etc.This book isn't racist, in my opinion - but I understand how it could come off as such. The thing about Ashkenazi Jews having enhanced intelligence has a certain taint to it, because it's been used to justify (racist) hierarchies of the ""races"". And this thing about the Ashkenazi Jews comes up again and again: because they experienced unique conditions of repression in northern Europe for a thousand years, those who could really be successful in intellectually challenging roles such as (principally) money-lending, were more reproductively successful. So there is a lot of evidence presented, and I buy it, and I don't believe I am racist for buying it, but still - there are a lot of racists who also buy it, and that makes me a bit uncomfortable.Even though the book has a lot of footnotes and a good bibliography, I felt the authors did a poor job of constructing arguments. It seemed they were all over the place, all the time - promising answers and then discursively wandering away from what they promised to answer, never getting back to it. Like on page 91 we are told ""we now understand quite a bit about the genetic changes that led to light skin in northern Eurasians."" Wow! That's a big statement; I was prepared for a big explanation. But a dozen pages of stuff later, they were moving on to another topic; I carefully re-read the intervening pages, which were all quite interesting, but I confirmed that they definitely never delivered on their promised explanation of skin color.I give it 4 stars because I love the subject matter and am fascinated by the implications of the fact that all modern people emerged from a small African population of humans who lived about 50kya. Our written history is so microscopic compared to all of what must have happened - just to know what we can infer from genetics to fill in the blanks is amazing. Unfortunately racists will also find much to love in this book; I can't help that and it's not the fault of the authors either."
38,0465002218,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50953703-groot,5,"The rate of human evolution has accelerated radically over the last 10,000 years. This takes a genetic perspective on history and archaeology, benefiting from the vast improvement in the science and technology of genomic knowledge. Organisms, including people, adapt to changing environments, and our environment is changing radically, starting with the Upper Paleolithic, the introduction of farming, settling into towns, domesticating animals (including milk-yielding species), the vast increase in the number of humans and consequent breeding ground for infectious diseases, literacy and numeracy and their contribution to human prospering for those that could excel at them, and so on. A fascinating book, with some safe and interesting insights, but not shying away from more controversial hypotheses, such as the contributions of proto-humans, such as Neanderthals and Denisovans, to modern humans, with their longer-term adaptations to living in northern climes, possibly contributing lighter skin and other features."
39,0465002218,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40298632-joe-q,4,"This book cogently argues that, rather than ending with the dawn of modern Homo sapiens, evolution has been continuing apace over the last 10,000 years. Arguments from natural selection are used to explain patterns in world history, including Europeans' success in displacing Amerindians in the Americas and their failure to displace Africans in the tropical parts of that continent. It's a quick read, and very enlightening.While the authors make their case very clearly, I would have liked to see them explore whether modern medical science -- or demographics in general -- has weakened the link between ""reproductive fitness"" and actual numbers of descendants. Given that so much infectious disease can be treated or controlled, quality food and good sanitation are abundant, and many very ""reproductively fit"" people choose to have small families (or none at all), does their thesis still apply? Will the next 10,000 years be like the last 10,000 were?"
40,0465002218,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70611546-kevin,2,"According to this book, conventional evolutionary psychology claims that we became adapted to the savannah after spending hundreds of thousands of years other. The tens of thousands of years since we left Africa were not enough for evolution to do anything more than tweak us around the edges and the time since the agricultural revolution is a mere blink of an evolutionary eye and human evolution has more or less slowed to a crawl.The 10,000 Year Explosion is evolutionary psychology dialed up to 11. Rather than slowing down, evolution has actually sped up. Genetic change was responsible not just for the agricultural revolution but the scientific and industrial revolutions too, not to mention the rise and fall of empires. Examples of candidate mutations abound. The sum of the books arguments, though was unconvincing. "

With a firm root in evolutionary theory, Cochran and Harpending convinces anyone who isn't blind or an absolute idiot about the impossibility of evolutionary pressures on humans halting to a stop. The authors lays out evolutionary thinking in such a way that the reader will by the end of the book feel a lot more confident in her understanding of the world. It should truly be read by everyone.The book can be read by anyone without any prior knowledge on evolutionary theory. The minimum level of the book is high-school.

The concept of a variant on 'artificial selection' as is observed for dogs and other domesticated animals and plants, seems suggested although not explicit. This seems based on advantages for particular populations, with more offspring among those with particular genetic traits and cultural adaptations such as herding, farming, urbanization, domestic animals such as horses, and improved military weaponry. Pretty persuasive that the process seems ongoing."

Then I brought the book with me on my trips to Chengdu with parents and reading became on and off and hard to concentrate. So the middle part of the book is a bit lost to me. Then I returned home and read the last chapter about why a branch of Jews (German Jews) are super smart while bearing more genetic diseases really really interesting and I learned a lot. This last chapter alone make the book deserve a 5 star.

The book describes itself as the “…the latest edition to the fast emerging discipline of biohistory.” There’s been quite a bit of news related to this area lately, so I thought that it was time to give it a read.The book opens with a refutation of “conventional wisdom”, with the authors claiming that human evolution has accelerated in the last ten thousand years due to various selection pressures, such as agriculture, geographic expansion and climate change. They go on to examine the period that started fifty to forty thousand years ago when modern humans moved into the European territories of the Neanderthal. Ten thousand years later the Neanderthal were extinct and humans were flourishing. No one knows for sure but it seems that humans displayed better adaptations such as advanced language, tools and hunting techniques. There is convincing genetic evidence that we interbreed with Neanderthals and picked up and kept various advantageous genes – just ask Ozzy Osbourne. The ensuing four chapters examine the impact of the advent of agriculture some ten thousand years ago and how the changes to what we ate affected our genetic makeup; the genetic flow of humanity as expressed by selective sweeps of particular genes and also the impact of expansion on humans throughout the globe. A succinct summary - but if you want to know the facts then read the book! But is it worth reading?The ideas presented in The 10,000 Year Explosion are certainly well argued. The authors blend history, archaeology, paleontology and biology to weave their arguments convincingly. They refer to their work as “genetic history” – a “new kind of history.” This is all very well but unfortunately the flaw of this book is that the writing style is relatively bland. There is an effort to engage and give the facts some personality, but as interested as I was in the arguments presented I often found myself bored. I believe that writing popular science is a tricky thing, because, after all, you don’t want to dumb it down; but also you don’t want to put the average reader off either. After reading this book I appreciate science writers such as Paul Davies and Marcus Chown for their efforts to both explain and engage.The 10,000 Year Explosion ends with a case study of the Ashkenazi Jews – Jews that were confined to Europe from medieval times and that were restricted to money lending and clerical professions; the kind of jobs that required a certain level of intelligence. The combination of the demands of their profession and their tendency to marry within their faith meant that the European Jews were selected for a higher intelligence than Jews in the Middle East. Five hundred or so years later descendants of this group were making the major scientific breakthroughs throughout many disciplines and they also displayed higher IQs than other groups. A fascinating case study, but once again the bland writing created a nagging sense of boredom.The story of human evolution is an amazing tale to behold - one that’s obsessed me on and off for years. It’s compelling, fascinating and most of all it’s our story. Unfortunately this book does not really capture the sense of wonder that our story can engender, which is a shame. Read this book if you want the facts, but perhaps look elsewhere if you want to feel that elusive sense of wonder. Although I was slightly disappointed overall, the one interesting thing this book did do for me was to make me ponder just how our present point in human evolutionary history will be viewed in five hundred years; and that’s not such a bad thing."

It is a grabber of a design that gets your eye from across the floor of the library or bookshop.The authors may not like this, but I am giving away a highly kept secret they mention in the index--Yes I actually do read indices, to me they give a sense of the real core of a book and let you know what the authors think is really important. If you have limited time perusing the index gets you right to the action. Well, in the index there is an entry--Lost Dutchman Mine, location, 400. I guess this means that one or both of the authors knows where this reputedly amazingly rich gold mine is hidden. It is a legend in its own right, I'm sure there are some good books about it and Wikipedia says people are still looking for it. The authors know where it is and they are telling you. It is all on page 400! However, my paperback edition (2010) only has 288 pages including the index. It's a wonderfully hidden joke that I did not see mentioned in any other review. I guess we'll have to wait another 10,000 years for the ""20,000 Year Explosion"" followup edition that will explain how humans have evolved since the demise of print books, audio CDs, broadcast television, sidewalks and other signs of civilization. Hopefully this newer edition will have a page 400.To me this was a fascinating read. ""Explosion"" discusses human genetics and evolution, a subject that I have found interesting for a long time but have not actually had the patience to really delve into in order to get a comprehensive basis for true knowledge--I feel that it would take a little more time than I want to dedicate to find out more about organic chemistry and processes of how organic molecules act and react with other to make up DNA mechanisms, and how that affects how life works etc. I did tackle ""The Eight Day of Creation"" some decades ago...what I read of it was fascinating but then life's personal activities got in the way. But the thing that really stopped me was that I kept the used copy (It cost only 1 dollar) of the book I bought on a back shelf for about 10 years and then when I finally started reading it and got a little more than half way through--it is an 800 page monster--I realized that it was mis-bound and many pages were duplicated but also very mixed up and completely out of order. More importantly, a lot was missing overall and the local library didn't have a copy that that could be loaned out to read. I was not going to sit in the library and work my way through it. So basically, that's now where I left my knowledge of genes and DNA and alleles and the mechanics of genetics.That said, I did appreciate the simplification in general that the authors made to get their point across. That point is that we are still evolving, our physiology is still reacting to the environment around us trying to adapt us in the best way possible to allow for species survival and thriving. It's a good read and will get me to read more about this subject. Parts of their theses reminded me of Julian Jaynes' book with that wonderful title--""The Development of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind"" and his theory that we humans finally realized that it wasn't the Gods talking to each and every one of us, it was just our brains finally melding messages together across the corpus callosum inside each of our skulls."
58,0465002218,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1219617-erik,3,"Cochran and Harpending dispel the long-held scientific notion that human evolution reached a plateau tens of thousands of years ago, as well as all change has been cultural. Instead, they argue that cultural change has effected genetic change, and vice versa. Not only did agriculture select for certain characteristics – like lactose tolerance as a result of animal husbandry, for one – but so introgression with Neanderthals, which has been historically frowned upon in the scientific community due to biased in favor of the notion homo sapiens purity. ""The explosion is ongoing: Human evolution didn’t stop when anatomically modern humans appeared, or when they expanded out of Africa. It never stopped – and why would it? Evolutionary stasis requires a static environment, whereas behavioral modernity is all about innovation and change. Stability is exactly what we have not had. This should be obvious, but instead the human sciences have labored under the strange idea that evolution stopped 40,000 years ago.""One of their most controversial notions is their well-supported argument that the Ashkenazi Jews of Eastern Europe have a genetic propensity for higher intelligence as a direct result of marriage only within their community combined with societal pressures against intermarriage with gentiles, strict limitations on what kinds of white-collars jobs they could hold (banking, finance, science), and the resulting economic rewards for succeeding economically (higher birth rate, better heated homes, more personal privacy in those homes that helped thwart contact with diseases fatal to the more impoverished, etc.). All of these combined set the conditions for natural selection that resulted in a better-educated and genetically-insular population with a slightly higher-than-average IQ when compared to the other European genetic groups that they lived alongside. Perhaps this is a stretch for the politically correct crowd, but it certainly is worthy of reasoned debate and consideration. (On the flip side, Cochran and Harpending are quick to remind us that the Ashkenazi Jews also have an accompanying genetic predisposition for various diseases that other groups do not have.)As an educator, I was particularly struck by their assertion that ""Nongenetic factors also influence IQ, but for the most part, the ones that matter are not the ones people thought would matter. Prenatal care, breastfeeding, nutrition, access to early education, Mozart in the womb, and oat bran all have little or no effect. Surprisingly, the way in which a family raised children seems to have no effect on adult IQ.""Alas, neither Cochran nor Harpending go on to detail just what nongenetic factors can or do influence IQ. (I would argue that the quality of formal education be one.)On a style note, I admit to wishing several times for either Richard Dawkins or Jared Diamond’s more persuasive and personable narrative styles. (No surprise, Diamond’s Guns, Germs, and Steel and The Third Chimpanzee are both quoted numerous times.) Of course, knowing that this is the first book between the Cochran and Harpending, I imagine that they will both improve in this area in future books the co-write. "
59,0465002218,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4975079-daniel-hammer,4,"This is just the kind of exciting, accessible and provocative science that I like to read about. For the most part. Cochran and Harpending's book presents the argument that human evolution has increased in pace over the last 10,000 years. This is in contrast to a more standard view which argues that, due to the ability to culturally and technologically reshape our environment, modern human beings have less of a need to evolve biologically in response to environmental pressures. He begins with a few basics of populations genetic which support the likelihood of an increased rate of evolution in recent times. Among these are the increase in human population numbers; more people equals more chances for mutations to develop. Also important is the fact that our diets have changed more in the past 10,000 years than had hominin diets for the previous several million years. This would have introduced significant dietary pressures on us, and those who could tolerate or process certain foods (such as lactose) would be more evolutionarily successful. 10,000 years ago is a key starting point because it corresponds with the advent of agriculture, which introduced larger populations, new diets, crowded living, and more.Cochran and Harpending survey a range or very interesting ideas. They argue that humans almost definitely bred with Neanderthals. That lactose tolerance was a key to the spread of Indo-European languages, via the adaptable, milk-drinking people which spoke those tongues. They examine a number of genetic mutations which are limited to certain populations and reflect recent genetic (evolutionary) responses to environment and diet, like sickle-cell trait. They suggest that light skin color may have evolved for more than just the ability to synthesize more vitamin D, and that the human brain likely underwent important structural changes just in the past 30,000 years.All of this is seriously interesting, and a pleasure to read and debate. The downside is that Cochran and Harpending are slim on evidence for much of this. I an inclined to believe they are largely correct, but too often the book reads like a laundry list of exciting suggestions, without much to back them up.This book certainly worth a quick read and makes some great food for thought."
60,0465002218,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19773041-joseph-hirsch,3,"Depending on a whole host of factors (your scientific background, religion, personal experiences, and biases, to name a few) one could come away from ""The 10,000 Year Explosion"" thinking that anthropologist Greg Cochran is an intellectually voracious man who wants to know where and how humans differ in their genes in order to cure diseases and increase social harmony, or conversely, that he is a latter-day Cesare Lombroso who wants to bust out the calipers to measure our heads to find out which of us have seed worth saving for his eugenic experiments and which of us need to undergo forced sterilization.Having read his ""10,000 Year Explosion"" written by Cochran in conjunction with geneticist Henry Harpending, I found the authors to be intelligent, humorous men capable of explaining very, very complicated concepts in a way that did not scare off this layman. The problem I had with the book was not some kind of moral objection (science doesn't care about my feelings) but rather the nagging sense that this was a paper or presentation stretched out to book length, and that any one of the ideas explicated in the book in one chapter would have made a great book in itself. Dr (?) Cochran cites Jared Diamond's ""Guns, Germs, and Steel"" multiple times throughout the book; I just wish he'd taken the same sort of ""deep dive"" approach to this book in terms of its structure and breadth. In brief (and it's hard to be brief with this information) Cochran argues that human evolution did not stop roughly 40,000 years ago as many believe, and that evolution is an ongoing process, and that this process can ""explode"" in a very local and idiosyncratic way, based on everything from rigorous man-made laws (especially regarding things like out-marriage) to civic arrangements (one of the more disturbing but fascinating detours in the book holds that once humans shifted from hunter-gatherers to agrarians, we started to favor the conforming and even servile over the independent and strong).Someone, in an attempt to summarize this book, called it something like an exploration of history through the lens of genetics, which would be a pretty good capitulation. The authors take the reader from ancient Asian Steppes where Mongol hordes perfected a simple but effective reproduction strategy (kill the men and mate with the women), all the way forward in time to an Israeli hospital in the twenty-first, where the idea that genetic advantages can become disadvantages or can even be made irrelevant is explored. As previously mentioned, all of the subjects dealt with are fascinating, and presented in a clear manner. But it's a bit too thumbnail for my taste. Your take might differ. I'd certainly take a class with Dr. Cochran, though, if I were still in college. I imagine it would be easy to stay awake during his seminars. "
61,0465002218,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32156837-mike,5,"This is a fascinating book on the mutual influence of genes on culture and of culture on genes. The ""explosion"" referred to in the title was the advent of agriculture, which greatly multiplied the size of the human population, greatly altered culture, and redirected human evolution down new paths to adapt to this new culture. When human population increased the rate of genetic mutations increased correspondingly, which increased the rate of evolution (by 100 fold according to the authors). Humans, especially those in densely populated areas, have been evolving rapidly in the last 10,000 years--and their evolution is driven by their environment, including their culture. But, then, newly evolved humans, being different from their ancestors, develop different cultural environments more suitable to their nature. Thus, evolution and human culture form a feedback loop. Of course, in a world of relatively isolated regional and local populations, their will be different natural/cultural environments, hence differential evolution to adapt to them. Inuit amidst ice flows and tundra would not (and did not) evolve the same way as Melanesians on their tropical islands. And evolution may proceed quite rapidly under certain circumstances, particularly large population size and major environmental impetus. On top of well supported scientific theory, the authors add numerous examples of evolution-culture interaction throughout history. It's an important new perspective on history. The style of writing is clear, needless academic jargon wisely jettisoned. The historical examples that run through the book seem somewhat arbitrarily chosen, but, this being a relatively new field of inquiry, the authors are probably just following the trail of such evidence as we currently have. The newness also means we face some uncertainties of interpretation. The authors note evidential limitations when present, but are bold to cast forth their nets in some clever speculations, one of which has been confirmed since publication (non-African humans have some Neanderthal DNA). This is what scientists do and are meant to do when faced with uncertainty: formulate hypotheses, preferably intelligent, informed ones. In this book, we have something of a hybrid beast: a populist approach with some vanguard hypothesizing. "
62,0465002218,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5466619-naftoli,5,"This book has opened my eyes to so many issues; to say that it is transformative is understatement. I had been taught in college that human evolution stopped with the advent of culture, that culture made adjustments to the environment thus eliminating the need for biology to fine tune our bodies. I had also been trained to view IQ tests as simply racist tools used by white patriarchal society to convince the priveleged that minority people are inferior - it sounds hyperbolic but I was actually told this by professors! I had also been taught that all humans are essentially the same (one world, one people, that race is only skin deep). When confronted with differences in intelligence, adaptability, etc. I was taught that this is due to political inequities, war, in short, culture. This book challenges these biases. I will no doubt read this book again at some later date and refer to it from time to time. I am not trained as a scientist so I will have to review and re-review the data from time to time. I was trained as a social scientist - cultural anthropology - so I am the target audience for this book. The issue regarding Neanderthals and what became of them is one of the first issues undertaken in this work; I found it to be both realistic and reasonable. The authors rely on population genetics, mathematics, extrapolations, &c in an effort to buttress their position that modern humans have inherited a small but important percentage of Neanderthal genetic material. It makes sense to me.Among so many things, I admire the authors for having the courage to challenge our current received wisdom. It seems to me that they have taken quite a risk in doing so as there is nothing 'politically correct' about this book. The authors even point to data that most writers shy away from as it may cast them in a negative light. Whatever the reason for shying away from data, it is vital that we humans look facts straight in the face and deal with the realities of our evolution, our cultural wisdom and ethnocentricities, and our impact upon this planet. At the minimum, debate these issues rather than labeling and dismissing them. This book tackles a few of these issues."
63,0465002218,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4534780-alina,5,"The old thinking is that, when cultural evolution took off, biological evolution stopped -- because instead of being shaped by our environment, we began shaping our environment to us. That idea always seemed reasonable to me, but this book has changed my mind. The authors contend that, on the contrary, evolution has sped up since the neolithic revolution. The social innovations associated with agriculture and civilization mean we have subjected ourselves to major new environmental pressures, and that has fueled rapid natural selection. Their idea is that cultural evolution interacts with biological evolution; the two drive each other. One of the book's points is that natural selection isn't as slow as is often believed, since altering just one gene or even one nucleotide can sometimes result in important advantages. By examining evidence from the exploding field of population genetics, as well as other sources, the authors find indications of significant biological change in the past 10,000 years or so. Examples include differing disease resistance in response to local conditions, the development of lactose tolerance in dairy farmers, and selection for higher intelligence among Ashkenazi Jews. Although I'd heard of some of these things before, I hadn't appreciated the impact on history. The authors make a convincing case that genetic factors can be decisive. I no longer think of biological evolution as something that stopped being important once modern humans came into existence."

那么为何德系犹太人特别聪慧呢？想要解答这个谜题，或许我们可以看看关于阿什肯纳兹犹太人的DNA我们都知道些什么，因为事实证明它们还有另一个有趣的特征。即，它们有一组不常见的严重遗传病，例如家族性黑蒙性痴呆症、高雪氏病、家族性自主神经功能异常，以及两种不同形式的遗传性乳腺癌（BRCA1和BRCA2），这些疾病在阿什肯纳兹犹太人群体中的发病率比在其他欧洲人群中高将近100倍。我们相信这两个谜题有单一的解释。我们认为阿什肯纳兹犹太人在北欧逗留的时期在白领职业的自然选择中获得了成功，而这成功源自他们智力上的遗传优势。但对于智力的强势选择也产生了一些让人不愉快的副作用：提高遗传携带者智商的等位基因同时也对纯合体产生损害。这一类解释自然是有争议的。事实上很多人排斥这一类说法：智力是可测量的，由遗传决定的，不同的人类群体间有智力上的差异。有趣的是，这些批评和斥责甚少来自从事认知测试及其结果分析的科学工作者。业内对此很少或几乎没有任何争议，智商测试是准确的，测试结果能预测学术成就和个体生活的其他方面，而且智商值有极高的遗传率。如果遗传的确能影响智力，那么一段时间后，智力带来的繁殖优势必然会带来更高的智力。这个简单的逻辑是关于自然选择的演化理论的核心：能增加繁殖的基因在人类群体中会随时间推移变得越来越常见。.................我们认为印欧扩张起始于乳糖耐受突变的频率增高，当其频率增高至足以使整个人群转型从事制乳业经济的时候，印欧人就迅速扩散至整个南俄大草原。这迅速的扩张就有可能导致说近似语言的同一人群分散在从当今的乌克兰直到乌拉尔河地区这一广阔区域。因为扩张如此迅速，语言还没有分化，所以这一广大区域中分散的人群说的还是相似的语言。印欧人前进的步伐持续至进入欧洲，在那里制乳业在生态学效应上足以跟早期农业竞争，而且前者催生了一种远远更具侵略性的文化。印欧文化很可能是更好战的，因为印欧人群的高机动性、更多的人口数量和更好的营养使他们能比其他人群更经常赢得战争。而他们的胜利反过来又会提升他们的军事行动效率，从而成功哺育了更多成功。从印欧人基因在欧洲基因库占的相对低的比例来看，他们似乎实行的是精英统治，做被征服人群的统治者但没有摧毁或替代原先的居住者。然而相对小的精英人口常常能够让所有其余人口说他们的语言。此外，印欧人还把乳糖耐受的等位基因加进了本地的混合基因库。乳糖耐受突变在印欧人入侵前的欧洲很罕见或根本不存在，然而当制乳业受自然选择青睐的时候，它就在欧洲变得很常见了，特别是在北欧。[20]印欧语言和文化在制乳业流行的地域传播扩散，比方说，它们还进入了南欧和伊朗，然而中东的强势国家们似乎阻止了这些语言文化进入中东。我们认为印欧扩张起始于乳糖耐受突变的频率增高，当其频率增高至足以使整个人群转型从事制乳业经济的时候，印欧人就迅速扩散至整个南俄大草原。这迅速的扩张就有可能导致说近似语言的同一人群分散在从当今的乌克兰直到乌拉尔河地区这一广阔区域。因为扩张如此迅速，语言还没有分化，所以这一广大区域中分散的人群说的还是相似的语言。印欧人前进的步伐持续至进入欧洲，在那里制乳业在生态学效应上足以跟早期农业竞争，而且前者催生了一种远远更具侵略性的文化。印欧文化很可能是更好战的，因为印欧人群的高机动性、更多的人口数量和更好的营养使他们能比其他人群更经常赢得战争。而他们的胜利反过来又会提升他们的军事行动效率，从而成功哺育了更多成功。从印欧人基因在欧洲基因库占的相对低的比例来看，他们似乎实行的是精英统治，做被征服人群的统治者但没有摧毁或替代原先的居住者。然而相对小的精英人口常常能够让所有其余人口说他们的语言。此外，印欧人还把乳糖耐受的等位基因加进了本地的混合基因库。乳糖耐受突变在印欧人入侵前的欧洲很罕见或根本不存在，然而当制乳业受自然选择青睐的时候，它就在欧洲变得很常见了，特别是在北欧。[20]印欧语言和文化在制乳业流行的地域传播扩散，比方说，它们还进入了南欧和伊朗，然而中东的强势国家们似乎阻止了这些语言文化进入中东。.......一开始他们是作为基督教与穆斯林世界的中介的国际商人。然而随着穆斯林和基督徒（特别是意大利人）逐渐开始直接通商，阿什肯纳兹犹太商人越来越多地开始从事本地贸易。当对犹太人的迫害越来越严重从而长距离旅行无法得到安全保障之后，德系犹太人越来越专注于金融业，这个行业对他们是敞开的，因为基督徒被禁止放高利贷。在公元1100年前绝大部分德系犹太人都是放贷者，这一模式延续了几个世纪。[15]这些职业（交易和金融业）有很高的智商需求，我们可以肯定没有其他人类群体有这么高数量比例的人口在长时段内从事需要很高认知能力的职业。有时我们能找到相当详尽的阿什肯纳兹犹太人的商业活动记录。比如关于南法鲁西永犹太人在约公元1270年就有这样的记录：“有全面证据证明这群犹太人以放贷为生，实质上完全没有从事任何其他种类的经济活动。有记录的228名男性犹太人中近八成在向他们的基督教邻居放贷。犹太女人（几乎都是寡妇）放贷的也很常见，这些来自弱势者的资本被投资到相似的渠道。并且最积极从事放贷的犹太人似乎在他们的群体内是最受尊崇的。................他们曾是波兰立陶宛王国的管理者阶层。除了读写能力之外，在这些特定职业上取得成功所依靠的是类似于现今商人的素质，至少也需要有追踪复杂交易和资金流动的能力。最终，随着波兰立陶宛王国的阿什肯纳兹犹太人人口数量上升，越来越多的犹太人成了手工艺者——毕竟对管理和金融职业的需求也是有一定限度的。然而在800到900年的时间段内，也就是大致从公元800年到公元1650或1700年，绝大部分的阿什肯纳兹犹太人从事的是管理和金融业，也就是复杂度很高的职业，他们几乎从来不当农民和匠人。在这个方面他们和所有其他定居人口都有所不同。事实上，在那个时代任何占有领地的人类族群都不可能有那么高比例的人口从事白领职业，因为这样农业生产率就会过低。九成的人口都必须务农，从而生产足够的粮食去养活他们自己和社会顶层少量的统治者、文员、士兵、匠人以及商人。对白领职业的自然选择只有在这一阶层独自成为一个族群的时候才有可能成功，这一族群必须靠职业而非其据地而界定。在高复杂度职业中取得成功的犹太人享有更高的遗传优势。学者怀里波说：“在富裕的家庭中有更多的孩子能活到成年。总体上属于更富裕阶层的许多商业领袖、显赫拉比、群体领袖和类似个体的谱系显示，这些人通常有4个、6个甚至8～9个孩子活到成年。........智商有很高的可遗传性。这意味着一个个体的智商值会部分取决于遗传影响，从而更接近他或她的父母和兄弟姐妹而不是随便哪个别人。同一对父母生下的子女即便在不同环境下养大也会有相近的智商值，而领养的兄弟姐妹即便在同一屋檐下长大也不会有相近的智商值。高度也是类似的：长得高的人更可能有高于平均身高的子女。事实上，成年人的智商值与身高一样主要受遗传因素影响。然而童年的智商值却受遗传影响更少，而更容易受周围环境影响。周围环境对儿童智商测试结果的影响会在青春期期间或其后消失，这成了美国先锋计划（Head Start Program）的基础，即宣扬智商值能因一定干预而提高。非遗传因素同样会影响智商值，但很多情况下那些起作用的因素都不是人们想象会起作用的因素。父母关爱、母乳喂养、营养情况、早教、子宫中听莫扎特音乐和燕麦麸几乎都没起什么作用。而让人惊讶的是，一个家庭养育孩子的方式看起来对孩子成年时的智商值没有任何影响。这有效地反驳了一些流行的环境决定论——它们对阿什肯纳兹犹太人的高智商做各种成长环境方面的解释，尤其反驳了那些认为犹太母亲用特殊的方式抚养孩子催发了他们的高智商的论调。...在阿什肯纳兹犹太人特别高发的遗传病中，广为人知的是家族性黑蒙性痴呆症、高雪氏病和BRCA1与BRCA2乳腺癌突变，但同时还有许多其他的疾病，比如尼曼匹克症、卡纳万病和家族性自主神经功能异常。有些会引起神经方面的问题。它们在阿什肯纳兹犹太人身上特别高发，这已经成了人类遗传学上一个长久的谜题。.....是什么样的性征在阿什肯纳兹犹太人身上比在他们的邻居身上更宝贵呢？嗯，我们有一些很强的线索。是什么性征在当今的德系犹太人身上最突出呢？他们是壮大如萨摩亚人，高如图西族人，以及牛奶耐受如荷兰人吗？不是的，他们的特殊性征就是智力。这些突变体本身就提示了这一点：它们中的一些看起来就很像会提高智商的，考虑到它们作用于中枢神经系统的发展。鞘脂类突变体特别有可能具有提升智力的作用。在每一种这类突变体中，都有一些特定鞘脂累积；这些鞘脂是变更过的脂类分子，它们在信号传输中起作用，并在神经组织中特别常见。研究者已经确定这些鞘脂类作用水平的提升会引致神经元（中枢神经系统的基本细胞）之间更多的连接（高雪氏病的轴突生长）。在家族性黑蒙性痴呆症的情形中有相似的效应：特定的累积混合物（GM2神经节苷脂）作用水平提升会促进树突（连接神经元的纤细多分支突起）的增长。[41]这种树突生成的增加现象也同样发生在A型尼曼匹克细胞出现、动物版黑蒙性痴呆症和尼曼匹克病的情形下。这些都是已知的疾病等位基因中唯一能引致神经连接增加的因素。我们同时还有（并不确凿的）证据证明德系犹太人身上常见的一些基因变异有可能提升智力。我们研究了耶路撒冷高雪氏病患者的职业——实际上是所有在耶路撒冷沙尔泽德克医学中心（Shaare Zedek Medical

这爆发如今还在持续：人类演化并没有止步于解剖学意义上的现代人类出现，或他们扩张走出非洲的时候。它从来没有停止。而且它怎么会停下呢？演化停滞需要一个静滞的环境，而行为现代化一直带来的都是革新和变化。一直以来我们都不曾有稳定和静滞的环境。这一点应该是很明显的，然而人类科学不仅忽视了它，相反还一直在一个奇怪的前提下辛勤地做研究，这个奇怪的想法认为演化在4万年前就停止了。 所有这些都意味着也必然意味着，生物变化是驱动历史的重要因素。当然它不是唯一的因素，而且很奇怪的是，它还被与更传统的影响绑定在一起。诸如乳糖耐受一类的遗传变化的出现和传播是文化革新（例如农业的发展）的结果，它同时也源自随机出现的合适的突变。这些遗传变化反过来也对文化产生了影响。印欧人的扩张，欧洲人在北美和澳大利亚的成功定居，“瓜分非洲”的失败，阿什肯纳兹犹太人进入智力舞台，甚至有可能工业革命和科学的兴起，所有这些看来都是生物和文化变化之永恒的舞步所营造的。 如果人类科学的研究者们继续忽略自然选择从未停止作用这一事实，他们就会把许多重要问题的解答线索给丢掉，把谜题变成秘密。科尔特斯带着500人就征服并控制了几百万人的帝国。想要解释这件事情而不提持续演化带来的疾病抵御机制中的生物学差异，这完全不可能。公元前5世纪的修昔底德说人类特征是不会变化的，所以可以预测，而当今许多科学家相信人类特征几万年前就停止了改变。历史学家们似乎一直以此为研究的前提。然而这样一来他们就忽略了巨大的契机，不仅在于解读人类的往昔，而且也在于塑造未来。贯穿人类历史的持续演化一直是一个巨大的自然界的实验，这个实验承诺了我们在理解自身、抵御疾病和精神病症方面的巨大的成果。利莫内苏尔加尔达隐藏着关于人类疾病的一个重要线索。世界上大概有100万个这样的小村庄，一定有更多类似的线索等待我们去发现。人类历史为我们展现的一些实验的成果甚至有可能帮助我们进行更有野心的尝试，去增加人类寿命和认知能力。从事人类科学的学者们是时候去甩掉一系列关于演化停止和“心理均一”的僵化教条了。每一刻时间都很宝贵，我们有一整个世界要去争取呢。"

I will give it 4/5 on account of me enjoying the ideas. These ideas, however, convince me to the extent of them ""making sense"". As a scientist I do expect much more in order to be convinced. I understand that this would make the book significantly longer and it might not necessarily be aimed for the ""general public"", but I would argue that here we don't really see the case of oversimplification being the issue, since the ideas, terminology, methodology described etc. are not necessarily ""dumbed down"". Instead, there is a certain haughty attitude - judging by this book alone, everybody other than the authors thinks genetic changes in human beings stopped 40,000 years ago and is wholly dogmatic. "
66,0465002218,http://goodreads.com/user/show/77887124-paul-clark,1,"This book rejects the view that race is primarily a social construct and proposes five hypotheses about genetic differences between ethnic groups. The first two, lactose tolerance and resistance to pathogens, are physiological and uncontroversial. The same cannot be said of the other three: that interbreeding between Eurasians and Neanderthals increased Eurasian intelligence, that long-term exposure to agriculture leads to a greater predisposition to the ‘bourgeois’ values of hard work and restraint, and that medieval restrictions on Ashkenazi Jews raised their intelligence. This review will focus on these three hypotheses.THE NEANDERTHAL ADVANTAGEHomo sapiens first encountered Neanderthals after leaving Africa 40,000 years ago. Cochran and Harpending speculate that interbreeding between the two species raised Eurasian intelligence, triggering the Upper Palaeolithic revolution in technology, symbolic behaviour and socio-economic organisation. Quite how sub-Saharan Africans later managed the same transition to modern behaviour without the benefit of Neanderthal DNA, the authors do not say.In any case, many archaeologists favour non-genetic explanations for the transition. Others argue that it occurred in Africa much earlier, citing discoveries like a large 70,000 year-old settlement in Sudan and sophisticated 44,000 year-old southern African artefacts. If critics of the Upper Palaeolithic model turn out to be correct, Cochran and Harpending’s highly speculative hypothesis would be falsified.THE AGRICULTURAL REVOLUTION AND BOURGEOIS VALUESThe authors claim that the development of agriculture led to the spread of genes for hard work and restraint among those populations in the Middle East, East Asia and Europe that have been exposed to agriculture for longest.Whilst superficially convincing, their account has serious flaws. The most glaring is the claim that ADHD has been bred out of China, where it actually affects up to 5% of schoolchildren. Other claims presented as facts are in reality matters of dispute. Agriculture might have arisen in sub-Saharan Africa 1,000 years earlier than the authors state, and their claim that Australian Aborigines never developed agriculture is contested.In most pre-capitalist societies, hard work did not have the significance the authors give it because any attempt to rise above your station was seen as sinful and peasants generally did as little work as they could get away with. The way people accumulated wealth was to squeeze it out of someone else as a warlord, a landlord or the holder of a sinecure that enabled them to milk others.Traders who acquired wealth through hard work dreamed of turning it into land, finding an impoverished noble family to marry into and putting their feet up. The only ones unable to do this were religious minorities like Armenians, Jews, Lebanese and Parsees. Cochran and Harpending claim that bourgeois genes made these communities successful middlemen when in fact it was their minority religion that trapped them in this niche.Similarly dubious is the claim that a lack of bourgeois genes fuels opposition to neo-liberalism in Latin America. Surely the growth of the industrial working class is a better explanation for the influence of socialism there.The authors contrast farmers who refrain from eating their seed corn with hunter gatherers who scupper efforts to turn them into herders by eating all their goats. But are hunter gatherers really so stupid? Or is this a case of a top-down innovation deliberately sabotaged by a community that never wanted it?The claim that aggression has been bred out of those populations longest exposed to agriculture is undermined by Cohen and Nisbett’s famous study that found startling differences in levels of aggression between genetically indistinguishable people from different cultures.THE INTELLIGENCE OF AHKANAZI JEWSCochran and Harpending’s third controversial hypothesis concerns the high IQs of Ashkenazi Jews, allegedly 12-15 points above other Europeans. They favour the theory that this is genetically determined because medieval north European Jews were restricted to white-collar occupations, particularly money lending, in which only intelligent people could succeed, giving them greater reproductive success in a community where marrying out was forbidden.However, the data they present is superficial. The influence of heritability on IQ shifts during a person’s life, rising dramatically as children grow to adulthood. But the authors never give the ages of the people in their statistics, making them impossible to assess.Their claim that 80% of economically active medieval Ashkenazim were full-time moneylenders is unconvincing, since Jews were confined to ghettoes with separate micro-economies, and rules forbidding the ‘improper subordination’ of Christians by Jews would probably have created the need for a Jewish servant class.Despite these caveats, this hypothesis is credible if unproven. There is no a priori reason why the heritable intelligence of every ethnic group should be the same and the Ashkenazim are a genetically closed community with a unique history.CONCLUSIONSThe 10,000 Year Explosion makes noteworthy points about physiological differences between the races and asks an interesting question about the intelligence of Ashkenazi Jews without quite supplying the answer. But it has conspicuously failed to demonstrate any other link between race and either intelligence or character. Cochran and Harpending’s Neanderthal hypothesis is highly speculative, and their claims about bourgeois values and agriculture rest on questionable evidence and a willingness to ignore simpler and more obvious explanations.Please see my website for a longer and fully sourced version of this review."

But I continued anyway, because I find the subject matter fascinating.Because, as I opined in my review of Before the Dawn: Recovering the Lost History of Our Ancestors, it's not by definition racist to inquire into the genetic basis of racial variation - it's only racist if you use such inquiry to justify privilege for one group, or even to consider one group as inherently superior to another. So, for example, it's not racist to find the genetic basis for why Kenyans are so successful at long-distance running. It is racist to conclude from that fact, that, I don't know, say, ""driving while black"" isn't really a thing. Or that separation of the ""races"" is a good thing, etc etc.This book isn't racist, in my opinion - but I understand how it could come off as such. The thing about Ashkenazi Jews having enhanced intelligence has a certain taint to it, because it's been used to justify (racist) hierarchies of the ""races"". And this thing about the Ashkenazi Jews comes up again and again: because they experienced unique conditions of repression in northern Europe for a thousand years, those who could really be successful in intellectually challenging roles such as (principally) money-lending, were more reproductively successful. So there is a lot of evidence presented, and I buy it, and I don't believe I am racist for buying it, but still - there are a lot of racists who also buy it, and that makes me a bit uncomfortable.Even though the book has a lot of footnotes and a good bibliography, I felt the authors did a poor job of constructing arguments. It seemed they were all over the place, all the time - promising answers and then discursively wandering away from what they promised to answer, never getting back to it. Like on page 91 we are told ""we now understand quite a bit about the genetic changes that led to light skin in northern Eurasians."" Wow! That's a big statement; I was prepared for a big explanation. But a dozen pages of stuff later, they were moving on to another topic; I carefully re-read the intervening pages, which were all quite interesting, but I confirmed that they definitely never delivered on their promised explanation of skin color.I give it 4 stars because I love the subject matter and am fascinated by the implications of the fact that all modern people emerged from a small African population of humans who lived about 50kya. Our written history is so microscopic compared to all of what must have happened - just to know what we can infer from genetics to fill in the blanks is amazing. Unfortunately racists will also find much to love in this book; I can't help that and it's not the fault of the authors either."

This takes a genetic perspective on history and archaeology, benefiting from the vast improvement in the science and technology of genomic knowledge. Organisms, including people, adapt to changing environments, and our environment is changing radically, starting with the Upper Paleolithic, the introduction of farming, settling into towns, domesticating animals (including milk-yielding species), the vast increase in the number of humans and consequent breeding ground for infectious diseases, literacy and numeracy and their contribution to human prospering for those that could excel at them, and so on. A fascinating book, with some safe and interesting insights, but not shying away from more controversial hypotheses, such as the contributions of proto-humans, such as Neanderthals and Denisovans, to modern humans, with their longer-term adaptations to living in northern climes, possibly contributing lighter skin and other features."

Arguments from natural selection are used to explain patterns in world history, including Europeans' success in displacing Amerindians in the Americas and their failure to displace Africans in the tropical parts of that continent. It's a quick read, and very enlightening.While the authors make their case very clearly, I would have liked to see them explore whether modern medical science -- or demographics in general -- has weakened the link between ""reproductive fitness"" and actual numbers of descendants. Given that so much infectious disease can be treated or controlled, quality food and good sanitation are abundant, and many very ""reproductively fit"" people choose to have small families (or none at all), does their thesis still apply? Will the next 10,000 years be like the last 10,000 were?"
70,0465002218,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70611546-kevin,2,"According to this book, conventional evolutionary psychology claims that we became adapted to the savannah after spending hundreds of thousands of years other. The tens of thousands of years since we left Africa were not enough for evolution to do anything more than tweak us around the edges and the time since the agricultural revolution is a mere blink of an evolutionary eye and human evolution has more or less slowed to a crawl.The 10,000 Year Explosion is evolutionary psychology dialed up to 11. Rather than slowing down, evolution has actually sped up. Genetic change was responsible not just for the agricultural revolution but the scientific and industrial revolutions too, not to mention the rise and fall of empires. Examples of candidate mutations abound. The sum of the books arguments, though was unconvincing. "

The authors lays out evolutionary thinking in such a way that the reader will by the end of the book feel a lot more confident in her understanding of the world. It should truly be read by everyone.The book can be read by anyone without any prior knowledge on evolutionary theory. The minimum level of the book is high-school.

The concept of a variant on 'artificial selection' as is observed for dogs and other domesticated animals and plants, seems suggested although not explicit. This seems based on advantages for particular populations, with more offspring among those with particular genetic traits and cultural adaptations such as herding, farming, urbanization, domestic animals such as horses, and improved military weaponry. Pretty persuasive that the process seems ongoing."

Then I brought the book with me on my trips to Chengdu with parents and reading became on and off and hard to concentrate. So the middle part of the book is a bit lost to me. Then I returned home and read the last chapter about why a branch of Jews (German Jews) are super smart while bearing more genetic diseases really really interesting and I learned a lot. This last chapter alone make the book deserve a 5 star.

86,0465002218,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12991284-jeremy,3,"As a long time reader of science books I was immediately attracted to this book due to its great title – titles are important, take note publishers. The last science book I read was the great The Fifth Miracle by Paul Davies, which was an examination of how life evolved. Cochran and Harpending’s book promised an argument against the long held theory that humans stopped evolving fifty thousand years ago, just after emerging out of Africa. The book describes itself as the “…the latest edition to the fast emerging discipline of biohistory.” There’s been quite a bit of news related to this area lately, so I thought that it was time to give it a read.The book opens with a refutation of “conventional wisdom”, with the authors claiming that human evolution has accelerated in the last ten thousand years due to various selection pressures, such as agriculture, geographic expansion and climate change. They go on to examine the period that started fifty to forty thousand years ago when modern humans moved into the European territories of the Neanderthal. Ten thousand years later the Neanderthal were extinct and humans were flourishing. No one knows for sure but it seems that humans displayed better adaptations such as advanced language, tools and hunting techniques. There is convincing genetic evidence that we interbreed with Neanderthals and picked up and kept various advantageous genes – just ask Ozzy Osbourne. The ensuing four chapters examine the impact of the advent of agriculture some ten thousand years ago and how the changes to what we ate affected our genetic makeup; the genetic flow of humanity as expressed by selective sweeps of particular genes and also the impact of expansion on humans throughout the globe. A succinct summary - but if you want to know the facts then read the book! But is it worth reading?The ideas presented in The 10,000 Year Explosion are certainly well argued. The authors blend history, archaeology, paleontology and biology to weave their arguments convincingly. They refer to their work as “genetic history” – a “new kind of history.” This is all very well but unfortunately the flaw of this book is that the writing style is relatively bland. There is an effort to engage and give the facts some personality, but as interested as I was in the arguments presented I often found myself bored. I believe that writing popular science is a tricky thing, because, after all, you don’t want to dumb it down; but also you don’t want to put the average reader off either. After reading this book I appreciate science writers such as Paul Davies and Marcus Chown for their efforts to both explain and engage.The 10,000 Year Explosion ends with a case study of the Ashkenazi Jews – Jews that were confined to Europe from medieval times and that were restricted to money lending and clerical professions; the kind of jobs that required a certain level of intelligence. The combination of the demands of their profession and their tendency to marry within their faith meant that the European Jews were selected for a higher intelligence than Jews in the Middle East. Five hundred or so years later descendants of this group were making the major scientific breakthroughs throughout many disciplines and they also displayed higher IQs than other groups. A fascinating case study, but once again the bland writing created a nagging sense of boredom.The story of human evolution is an amazing tale to behold - one that’s obsessed me on and off for years. It’s compelling, fascinating and most of all it’s our story. Unfortunately this book does not really capture the sense of wonder that our story can engender, which is a shame. Read this book if you want the facts, but perhaps look elsewhere if you want to feel that elusive sense of wonder. Although I was slightly disappointed overall, the one interesting thing this book did do for me was to make me ponder just how our present point in human evolutionary history will be viewed in five hundred years; and that’s not such a bad thing."
87,0465002218,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17431775-schwarzenberger,3,"Considering the subject matter, it is a light read with a lot of little tidbits thrown in about how many relatives Genghis Khan has that are still living across central Asia, how disease really helped Pizarro and only 168 soldiers tear apart the Inca Empire, where blue eyes originated, and other such scientific matters that make great dinner conversation and cocktail party opening lines.By the way, i like the cover with the almost stroboscopic depiction of evolutionary influenced skeletal uprightness and locomotion. It is a grabber of a design that gets your eye from across the floor of the library or bookshop.The authors may not like this, but I am giving away a highly kept secret they mention in the index--Yes I actually do read indices, to me they give a sense of the real core of a book and let you know what the authors think is really important. If you have limited time perusing the index gets you right to the action. Well, in the index there is an entry--Lost Dutchman Mine, location, 400. I guess this means that one or both of the authors knows where this reputedly amazingly rich gold mine is hidden. It is a legend in its own right, I'm sure there are some good books about it and Wikipedia says people are still looking for it. The authors know where it is and they are telling you. It is all on page 400! However, my paperback edition (2010) only has 288 pages including the index. It's a wonderfully hidden joke that I did not see mentioned in any other review. I guess we'll have to wait another 10,000 years for the ""20,000 Year Explosion"" followup edition that will explain how humans have evolved since the demise of print books, audio CDs, broadcast television, sidewalks and other signs of civilization. Hopefully this newer edition will have a page 400.To me this was a fascinating read. ""Explosion"" discusses human genetics and evolution, a subject that I have found interesting for a long time but have not actually had the patience to really delve into in order to get a comprehensive basis for true knowledge--I feel that it would take a little more time than I want to dedicate to find out more about organic chemistry and processes of how organic molecules act and react with other to make up DNA mechanisms, and how that affects how life works etc. I did tackle ""The Eight Day of Creation"" some decades ago...what I read of it was fascinating but then life's personal activities got in the way. But the thing that really stopped me was that I kept the used copy (It cost only 1 dollar) of the book I bought on a back shelf for about 10 years and then when I finally started reading it and got a little more than half way through--it is an 800 page monster--I realized that it was mis-bound and many pages were duplicated but also very mixed up and completely out of order. More importantly, a lot was missing overall and the local library didn't have a copy that that could be loaned out to read. I was not going to sit in the library and work my way through it. So basically, that's now where I left my knowledge of genes and DNA and alleles and the mechanics of genetics.That said, I did appreciate the simplification in general that the authors made to get their point across. That point is that we are still evolving, our physiology is still reacting to the environment around us trying to adapt us in the best way possible to allow for species survival and thriving. It's a good read and will get me to read more about this subject. Parts of their theses reminded me of Julian Jaynes' book with that wonderful title--""The Development of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind"" and his theory that we humans finally realized that it wasn't the Gods talking to each and every one of us, it was just our brains finally melding messages together across the corpus callosum inside each of our skulls."
88,0465002218,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1219617-erik,3,"Cochran and Harpending dispel the long-held scientific notion that human evolution reached a plateau tens of thousands of years ago, as well as all change has been cultural. Instead, they argue that cultural change has effected genetic change, and vice versa. Not only did agriculture select for certain characteristics – like lactose tolerance as a result of animal husbandry, for one – but so introgression with Neanderthals, which has been historically frowned upon in the scientific community due to biased in favor of the notion homo sapiens purity. ""The explosion is ongoing: Human evolution didn’t stop when anatomically modern humans appeared, or when they expanded out of Africa. It never stopped – and why would it? Evolutionary stasis requires a static environment, whereas behavioral modernity is all about innovation and change. Stability is exactly what we have not had. This should be obvious, but instead the human sciences have labored under the strange idea that evolution stopped 40,000 years ago.""One of their most controversial notions is their well-supported argument that the Ashkenazi Jews of Eastern Europe have a genetic propensity for higher intelligence as a direct result of marriage only within their community combined with societal pressures against intermarriage with gentiles, strict limitations on what kinds of white-collars jobs they could hold (banking, finance, science), and the resulting economic rewards for succeeding economically (higher birth rate, better heated homes, more personal privacy in those homes that helped thwart contact with diseases fatal to the more impoverished, etc.). All of these combined set the conditions for natural selection that resulted in a better-educated and genetically-insular population with a slightly higher-than-average IQ when compared to the other European genetic groups that they lived alongside. Perhaps this is a stretch for the politically correct crowd, but it certainly is worthy of reasoned debate and consideration. (On the flip side, Cochran and Harpending are quick to remind us that the Ashkenazi Jews also have an accompanying genetic predisposition for various diseases that other groups do not have.)As an educator, I was particularly struck by their assertion that ""Nongenetic factors also influence IQ, but for the most part, the ones that matter are not the ones people thought would matter. Prenatal care, breastfeeding, nutrition, access to early education, Mozart in the womb, and oat bran all have little or no effect. Surprisingly, the way in which a family raised children seems to have no effect on adult IQ.""Alas, neither Cochran nor Harpending go on to detail just what nongenetic factors can or do influence IQ. (I would argue that the quality of formal education be one.)On a style note, I admit to wishing several times for either Richard Dawkins or Jared Diamond’s more persuasive and personable narrative styles. (No surprise, Diamond’s Guns, Germs, and Steel and The Third Chimpanzee are both quoted numerous times.) Of course, knowing that this is the first book between the Cochran and Harpending, I imagine that they will both improve in this area in future books the co-write. "
89,0465002218,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4975079-daniel-hammer,4,"This is just the kind of exciting, accessible and provocative science that I like to read about. For the most part. Cochran and Harpending's book presents the argument that human evolution has increased in pace over the last 10,000 years. This is in contrast to a more standard view which argues that, due to the ability to culturally and technologically reshape our environment, modern human beings have less of a need to evolve biologically in response to environmental pressures. He begins with a few basics of populations genetic which support the likelihood of an increased rate of evolution in recent times. Among these are the increase in human population numbers; more people equals more chances for mutations to develop. Also important is the fact that our diets have changed more in the past 10,000 years than had hominin diets for the previous several million years. This would have introduced significant dietary pressures on us, and those who could tolerate or process certain foods (such as lactose) would be more evolutionarily successful. 10,000 years ago is a key starting point because it corresponds with the advent of agriculture, which introduced larger populations, new diets, crowded living, and more.Cochran and Harpending survey a range or very interesting ideas. They argue that humans almost definitely bred with Neanderthals. That lactose tolerance was a key to the spread of Indo-European languages, via the adaptable, milk-drinking people which spoke those tongues. They examine a number of genetic mutations which are limited to certain populations and reflect recent genetic (evolutionary) responses to environment and diet, like sickle-cell trait. They suggest that light skin color may have evolved for more than just the ability to synthesize more vitamin D, and that the human brain likely underwent important structural changes just in the past 30,000 years.All of this is seriously interesting, and a pleasure to read and debate. The downside is that Cochran and Harpending are slim on evidence for much of this. I an inclined to believe they are largely correct, but too often the book reads like a laundry list of exciting suggestions, without much to back them up.This book certainly worth a quick read and makes some great food for thought."
90,0465002218,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19773041-joseph-hirsch,3,"Depending on a whole host of factors (your scientific background, religion, personal experiences, and biases, to name a few) one could come away from ""The 10,000 Year Explosion"" thinking that anthropologist Greg Cochran is an intellectually voracious man who wants to know where and how humans differ in their genes in order to cure diseases and increase social harmony, or conversely, that he is a latter-day Cesare Lombroso who wants to bust out the calipers to measure our heads to find out which of us have seed worth saving for his eugenic experiments and which of us need to undergo forced sterilization.Having read his ""10,000 Year Explosion"" written by Cochran in conjunction with geneticist Henry Harpending, I found the authors to be intelligent, humorous men capable of explaining very, very complicated concepts in a way that did not scare off this layman. The problem I had with the book was not some kind of moral objection (science doesn't care about my feelings) but rather the nagging sense that this was a paper or presentation stretched out to book length, and that any one of the ideas explicated in the book in one chapter would have made a great book in itself. Dr (?) Cochran cites Jared Diamond's ""Guns, Germs, and Steel"" multiple times throughout the book; I just wish he'd taken the same sort of ""deep dive"" approach to this book in terms of its structure and breadth. In brief (and it's hard to be brief with this information) Cochran argues that human evolution did not stop roughly 40,000 years ago as many believe, and that evolution is an ongoing process, and that this process can ""explode"" in a very local and idiosyncratic way, based on everything from rigorous man-made laws (especially regarding things like out-marriage) to civic arrangements (one of the more disturbing but fascinating detours in the book holds that once humans shifted from hunter-gatherers to agrarians, we started to favor the conforming and even servile over the independent and strong).Someone, in an attempt to summarize this book, called it something like an exploration of history through the lens of genetics, which would be a pretty good capitulation. The authors take the reader from ancient Asian Steppes where Mongol hordes perfected a simple but effective reproduction strategy (kill the men and mate with the women), all the way forward in time to an Israeli hospital in the twenty-first, where the idea that genetic advantages can become disadvantages or can even be made irrelevant is explored. As previously mentioned, all of the subjects dealt with are fascinating, and presented in a clear manner. But it's a bit too thumbnail for my taste. Your take might differ. I'd certainly take a class with Dr. Cochran, though, if I were still in college. I imagine it would be easy to stay awake during his seminars. "
91,0465002218,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32156837-mike,5,"This is a fascinating book on the mutual influence of genes on culture and of culture on genes. The ""explosion"" referred to in the title was the advent of agriculture, which greatly multiplied the size of the human population, greatly altered culture, and redirected human evolution down new paths to adapt to this new culture. When human population increased the rate of genetic mutations increased correspondingly, which increased the rate of evolution (by 100 fold according to the authors). Humans, especially those in densely populated areas, have been evolving rapidly in the last 10,000 years--and their evolution is driven by their environment, including their culture. But, then, newly evolved humans, being different from their ancestors, develop different cultural environments more suitable to their nature. Thus, evolution and human culture form a feedback loop. Of course, in a world of relatively isolated regional and local populations, their will be different natural/cultural environments, hence differential evolution to adapt to them. Inuit amidst ice flows and tundra would not (and did not) evolve the same way as Melanesians on their tropical islands. And evolution may proceed quite rapidly under certain circumstances, particularly large population size and major environmental impetus. On top of well supported scientific theory, the authors add numerous examples of evolution-culture interaction throughout history. It's an important new perspective on history. The style of writing is clear, needless academic jargon wisely jettisoned. The historical examples that run through the book seem somewhat arbitrarily chosen, but, this being a relatively new field of inquiry, the authors are probably just following the trail of such evidence as we currently have. The newness also means we face some uncertainties of interpretation. The authors note evidential limitations when present, but are bold to cast forth their nets in some clever speculations, one of which has been confirmed since publication (non-African humans have some Neanderthal DNA). This is what scientists do and are meant to do when faced with uncertainty: formulate hypotheses, preferably intelligent, informed ones. In this book, we have something of a hybrid beast: a populist approach with some vanguard hypothesizing. "
92,0465002218,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5466619-naftoli,5,"This book has opened my eyes to so many issues; to say that it is transformative is understatement. I had been taught in college that human evolution stopped with the advent of culture, that culture made adjustments to the environment thus eliminating the need for biology to fine tune our bodies. I had also been trained to view IQ tests as simply racist tools used by white patriarchal society to convince the priveleged that minority people are inferior - it sounds hyperbolic but I was actually told this by professors! I had also been taught that all humans are essentially the same (one world, one people, that race is only skin deep). When confronted with differences in intelligence, adaptability, etc. I was taught that this is due to political inequities, war, in short, culture. This book challenges these biases. I will no doubt read this book again at some later date and refer to it from time to time. I am not trained as a scientist so I will have to review and re-review the data from time to time. I was trained as a social scientist - cultural anthropology - so I am the target audience for this book. The issue regarding Neanderthals and what became of them is one of the first issues undertaken in this work; I found it to be both realistic and reasonable. The authors rely on population genetics, mathematics, extrapolations, &c in an effort to buttress their position that modern humans have inherited a small but important percentage of Neanderthal genetic material. It makes sense to me.Among so many things, I admire the authors for having the courage to challenge our current received wisdom. It seems to me that they have taken quite a risk in doing so as there is nothing 'politically correct' about this book. The authors even point to data that most writers shy away from as it may cast them in a negative light. Whatever the reason for shying away from data, it is vital that we humans look facts straight in the face and deal with the realities of our evolution, our cultural wisdom and ethnocentricities, and our impact upon this planet. At the minimum, debate these issues rather than labeling and dismissing them. This book tackles a few of these issues."
93,0465002218,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4534780-alina,5,"The old thinking is that, when cultural evolution took off, biological evolution stopped -- because instead of being shaped by our environment, we began shaping our environment to us. That idea always seemed reasonable to me, but this book has changed my mind. The authors contend that, on the contrary, evolution has sped up since the neolithic revolution. The social innovations associated with agriculture and civilization mean we have subjected ourselves to major new environmental pressures, and that has fueled rapid natural selection. Their idea is that cultural evolution interacts with biological evolution; the two drive each other. One of the book's points is that natural selection isn't as slow as is often believed, since altering just one gene or even one nucleotide can sometimes result in important advantages. By examining evidence from the exploding field of population genetics, as well as other sources, the authors find indications of significant biological change in the past 10,000 years or so. Examples include differing disease resistance in response to local conditions, the development of lactose tolerance in dairy farmers, and selection for higher intelligence among Ashkenazi Jews. Although I'd heard of some of these things before, I hadn't appreciated the impact on history. The authors make a convincing case that genetic factors can be decisive. I no longer think of biological evolution as something that stopped being important once modern humans came into existence."

那么为何德系犹太人特别聪慧呢？想要解答这个谜题，或许我们可以看看关于阿什肯纳兹犹太人的DNA我们都知道些什么，因为事实证明它们还有另一个有趣的特征。即，它们有一组不常见的严重遗传病，例如家族性黑蒙性痴呆症、高雪氏病、家族性自主神经功能异常，以及两种不同形式的遗传性乳腺癌（BRCA1和BRCA2），这些疾病在阿什肯纳兹犹太人群体中的发病率比在其他欧洲人群中高将近100倍。我们相信这两个谜题有单一的解释。我们认为阿什肯纳兹犹太人在北欧逗留的时期在白领职业的自然选择中获得了成功，而这成功源自他们智力上的遗传优势。但对于智力的强势选择也产生了一些让人不愉快的副作用：提高遗传携带者智商的等位基因同时也对纯合体产生损害。这一类解释自然是有争议的。事实上很多人排斥这一类说法：智力是可测量的，由遗传决定的，不同的人类群体间有智力上的差异。有趣的是，这些批评和斥责甚少来自从事认知测试及其结果分析的科学工作者。业内对此很少或几乎没有任何争议，智商测试是准确的，测试结果能预测学术成就和个体生活的其他方面，而且智商值有极高的遗传率。如果遗传的确能影响智力，那么一段时间后，智力带来的繁殖优势必然会带来更高的智力。这个简单的逻辑是关于自然选择的演化理论的核心：能增加繁殖的基因在人类群体中会随时间推移变得越来越常见。.................我们认为印欧扩张起始于乳糖耐受突变的频率增高，当其频率增高至足以使整个人群转型从事制乳业经济的时候，印欧人就迅速扩散至整个南俄大草原。这迅速的扩张就有可能导致说近似语言的同一人群分散在从当今的乌克兰直到乌拉尔河地区这一广阔区域。因为扩张如此迅速，语言还没有分化，所以这一广大区域中分散的人群说的还是相似的语言。印欧人前进的步伐持续至进入欧洲，在那里制乳业在生态学效应上足以跟早期农业竞争，而且前者催生了一种远远更具侵略性的文化。印欧文化很可能是更好战的，因为印欧人群的高机动性、更多的人口数量和更好的营养使他们能比其他人群更经常赢得战争。而他们的胜利反过来又会提升他们的军事行动效率，从而成功哺育了更多成功。从印欧人基因在欧洲基因库占的相对低的比例来看，他们似乎实行的是精英统治，做被征服人群的统治者但没有摧毁或替代原先的居住者。然而相对小的精英人口常常能够让所有其余人口说他们的语言。此外，印欧人还把乳糖耐受的等位基因加进了本地的混合基因库。乳糖耐受突变在印欧人入侵前的欧洲很罕见或根本不存在，然而当制乳业受自然选择青睐的时候，它就在欧洲变得很常见了，特别是在北欧。[20]印欧语言和文化在制乳业流行的地域传播扩散，比方说，它们还进入了南欧和伊朗，然而中东的强势国家们似乎阻止了这些语言文化进入中东。我们认为印欧扩张起始于乳糖耐受突变的频率增高，当其频率增高至足以使整个人群转型从事制乳业经济的时候，印欧人就迅速扩散至整个南俄大草原。这迅速的扩张就有可能导致说近似语言的同一人群分散在从当今的乌克兰直到乌拉尔河地区这一广阔区域。因为扩张如此迅速，语言还没有分化，所以这一广大区域中分散的人群说的还是相似的语言。印欧人前进的步伐持续至进入欧洲，在那里制乳业在生态学效应上足以跟早期农业竞争，而且前者催生了一种远远更具侵略性的文化。印欧文化很可能是更好战的，因为印欧人群的高机动性、更多的人口数量和更好的营养使他们能比其他人群更经常赢得战争。而他们的胜利反过来又会提升他们的军事行动效率，从而成功哺育了更多成功。从印欧人基因在欧洲基因库占的相对低的比例来看，他们似乎实行的是精英统治，做被征服人群的统治者但没有摧毁或替代原先的居住者。然而相对小的精英人口常常能够让所有其余人口说他们的语言。此外，印欧人还把乳糖耐受的等位基因加进了本地的混合基因库。乳糖耐受突变在印欧人入侵前的欧洲很罕见或根本不存在，然而当制乳业受自然选择青睐的时候，它就在欧洲变得很常见了，特别是在北欧。[20]印欧语言和文化在制乳业流行的地域传播扩散，比方说，它们还进入了南欧和伊朗，然而中东的强势国家们似乎阻止了这些语言文化进入中东。.......一开始他们是作为基督教与穆斯林世界的中介的国际商人。然而随着穆斯林和基督徒（特别是意大利人）逐渐开始直接通商，阿什肯纳兹犹太商人越来越多地开始从事本地贸易。当对犹太人的迫害越来越严重从而长距离旅行无法得到安全保障之后，德系犹太人越来越专注于金融业，这个行业对他们是敞开的，因为基督徒被禁止放高利贷。在公元1100年前绝大部分德系犹太人都是放贷者，这一模式延续了几个世纪。[15]这些职业（交易和金融业）有很高的智商需求，我们可以肯定没有其他人类群体有这么高数量比例的人口在长时段内从事需要很高认知能力的职业。有时我们能找到相当详尽的阿什肯纳兹犹太人的商业活动记录。比如关于南法鲁西永犹太人在约公元1270年就有这样的记录：“有全面证据证明这群犹太人以放贷为生，实质上完全没有从事任何其他种类的经济活动。有记录的228名男性犹太人中近八成在向他们的基督教邻居放贷。犹太女人（几乎都是寡妇）放贷的也很常见，这些来自弱势者的资本被投资到相似的渠道。并且最积极从事放贷的犹太人似乎在他们的群体内是最受尊崇的。................他们曾是波兰立陶宛王国的管理者阶层。除了读写能力之外，在这些特定职业上取得成功所依靠的是类似于现今商人的素质，至少也需要有追踪复杂交易和资金流动的能力。最终，随着波兰立陶宛王国的阿什肯纳兹犹太人人口数量上升，越来越多的犹太人成了手工艺者——毕竟对管理和金融职业的需求也是有一定限度的。然而在800到900年的时间段内，也就是大致从公元800年到公元1650或1700年，绝大部分的阿什肯纳兹犹太人从事的是管理和金融业，也就是复杂度很高的职业，他们几乎从来不当农民和匠人。在这个方面他们和所有其他定居人口都有所不同。事实上，在那个时代任何占有领地的人类族群都不可能有那么高比例的人口从事白领职业，因为这样农业生产率就会过低。九成的人口都必须务农，从而生产足够的粮食去养活他们自己和社会顶层少量的统治者、文员、士兵、匠人以及商人。对白领职业的自然选择只有在这一阶层独自成为一个族群的时候才有可能成功，这一族群必须靠职业而非其据地而界定。在高复杂度职业中取得成功的犹太人享有更高的遗传优势。学者怀里波说：“在富裕的家庭中有更多的孩子能活到成年。总体上属于更富裕阶层的许多商业领袖、显赫拉比、群体领袖和类似个体的谱系显示，这些人通常有4个、6个甚至8～9个孩子活到成年。........智商有很高的可遗传性。这意味着一个个体的智商值会部分取决于遗传影响，从而更接近他或她的父母和兄弟姐妹而不是随便哪个别人。同一对父母生下的子女即便在不同环境下养大也会有相近的智商值，而领养的兄弟姐妹即便在同一屋檐下长大也不会有相近的智商值。高度也是类似的：长得高的人更可能有高于平均身高的子女。事实上，成年人的智商值与身高一样主要受遗传因素影响。然而童年的智商值却受遗传影响更少，而更容易受周围环境影响。周围环境对儿童智商测试结果的影响会在青春期期间或其后消失，这成了美国先锋计划（Head Start Program）的基础，即宣扬智商值能因一定干预而提高。非遗传因素同样会影响智商值，但很多情况下那些起作用的因素都不是人们想象会起作用的因素。父母关爱、母乳喂养、营养情况、早教、子宫中听莫扎特音乐和燕麦麸几乎都没起什么作用。而让人惊讶的是，一个家庭养育孩子的方式看起来对孩子成年时的智商值没有任何影响。这有效地反驳了一些流行的环境决定论——它们对阿什肯纳兹犹太人的高智商做各种成长环境方面的解释，尤其反驳了那些认为犹太母亲用特殊的方式抚养孩子催发了他们的高智商的论调。...在阿什肯纳兹犹太人特别高发的遗传病中，广为人知的是家族性黑蒙性痴呆症、高雪氏病和BRCA1与BRCA2乳腺癌突变，但同时还有许多其他的疾病，比如尼曼匹克症、卡纳万病和家族性自主神经功能异常。有些会引起神经方面的问题。它们在阿什肯纳兹犹太人身上特别高发，这已经成了人类遗传学上一个长久的谜题。.....是什么样的性征在阿什肯纳兹犹太人身上比在他们的邻居身上更宝贵呢？嗯，我们有一些很强的线索。是什么性征在当今的德系犹太人身上最突出呢？他们是壮大如萨摩亚人，高如图西族人，以及牛奶耐受如荷兰人吗？不是的，他们的特殊性征就是智力。这些突变体本身就提示了这一点：它们中的一些看起来就很像会提高智商的，考虑到它们作用于中枢神经系统的发展。鞘脂类突变体特别有可能具有提升智力的作用。在每一种这类突变体中，都有一些特定鞘脂累积；这些鞘脂是变更过的脂类分子，它们在信号传输中起作用，并在神经组织中特别常见。研究者已经确定这些鞘脂类作用水平的提升会引致神经元（中枢神经系统的基本细胞）之间更多的连接（高雪氏病的轴突生长）。在家族性黑蒙性痴呆症的情形中有相似的效应：特定的累积混合物（GM2神经节苷脂）作用水平提升会促进树突（连接神经元的纤细多分支突起）的增长。[41]这种树突生成的增加现象也同样发生在A型尼曼匹克细胞出现、动物版黑蒙性痴呆症和尼曼匹克病的情形下。这些都是已知的疾病等位基因中唯一能引致神经连接增加的因素。我们同时还有（并不确凿的）证据证明德系犹太人身上常见的一些基因变异有可能提升智力。我们研究了耶路撒冷高雪氏病患者的职业——实际上是所有在耶路撒冷沙尔泽德克医学中心（Shaare Zedek Medical Centre）治疗的患者。这些患者成为工程师或科学家的概率比以色列阿什肯纳兹犹太人从事这些职业的平均概率要高很多，事实上大概要高11倍。[42]关于阿什肯纳兹犹太人的另一种遗传病扭转性肌张力障碍也有类似的研究结果。这种遗传病最初被诊断出来的时候，研究者就已经开始注意到其患者不同寻常的智力水平。.....结论文化革新在很长的时间里都是人类生物学变化的驱动力，在约250万年前人类开始使用工具之后就一直如此。自然选择青睐那些从事早期文化革新的原始人类大脑，而这些革新本身就导向更多身体和心理上的变化。生物学特征和文化特征的协同演化一开始是很缓慢的，至少以现代标准看是慢的，但渐渐演化速度就快起来了。考古学记录显示我们的革新能力持续上升，直至约4万年前，我们已经为所谓的“人类革命”或旧石器时代晚期欧洲和亚洲北部的“创造性大爆发”蓄势待发。技术和艺术的突然兴盛发生在人类扩张并走出非洲的不久以后；它同时也跟生物学变化有关，而我们猜想这些生物学变化部分是由从尼安德特人或其他远古人类（亚洲大陆更早的占据者）身上偷得的基因驱动的。行为现代化导致更多的变化：人类制作更精良的工具，然后他们在数代人的时间里也反过来被这些工具不断塑造变化。农业出现之后，文化和生物演化都加速了，因为新的生活方式使人们有了新的需求。农业出现以前人类一直都是觅食者：农业带来的人口急剧增加使得更多有益的变异体出现，也使得更多新想法出现。我们人类在农业传播后的快速演化的确是一万年的爆发。 这爆发如今还在持续：人类演化并没有止步于解剖学意义上的现代人类出现，或他们扩张走出非洲的时候。它从来没有停止。而且它怎么会停下呢？演化停滞需要一个静滞的环境，而行为现代化一直带来的都是革新和变化。一直以来我们都不曾有稳定和静滞的环境。这一点应该是很明显的，然而人类科学不仅忽视了它，相反还一直在一个奇怪的前提下辛勤地做研究，这个奇怪的想法认为演化在4万年前就停止了。 所有这些都意味着也必然意味着，生物变化是驱动历史的重要因素。当然它不是唯一的因素，而且很奇怪的是，它还被与更传统的影响绑定在一起。诸如乳糖耐受一类的遗传变化的出现和传播是文化革新（例如农业的发展）的结果，它同时也源自随机出现的合适的突变。这些遗传变化反过来也对文化产生了影响。印欧人的扩张，欧洲人在北美和澳大利亚的成功定居，“瓜分非洲”的失败，阿什肯纳兹犹太人进入智力舞台，甚至有可能工业革命和科学的兴起，所有这些看来都是生物和文化变化之永恒的舞步所营造的。 如果人类科学的研究者们继续忽略自然选择从未停止作用这一事实，他们就会把许多重要问题的解答线索给丢掉，把谜题变成秘密。科尔特斯带着500人就征服并控制了几百万人的帝国。想要解释这件事情而不提持续演化带来的疾病抵御机制中的生物学差异，这完全不可能。公元前5世纪的修昔底德说人类特征是不会变化的，所以可以预测，而当今许多科学家相信人类特征几万年前就停止了改变。历史学家们似乎一直以此为研究的前提。然而这样一来他们就忽略了巨大的契机，不仅在于解读人类的往昔，而且也在于塑造未来。贯穿人类历史的持续演化一直是一个巨大的自然界的实验，这个实验承诺了我们在理解自身、抵御疾病和精神病症方面的巨大的成果。利莫内苏尔加尔达隐藏着关于人类疾病的一个重要线索。世界上大概有100万个这样的小村庄，一定有更多类似的线索等待我们去发现。人类历史为我们展现的一些实验的成果甚至有可能帮助我们进行更有野心的尝试，去增加人类寿命和认知能力。从事人类科学的学者们是时候去甩掉一系列关于演化停止和“心理均一”的僵化教条了。每一刻时间都很宝贵，我们有一整个世界要去争取呢。"
95,0465002218,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16831597-fran-globlek,4,"The authors manage to spoil many thought-provoking observations with a careless approach to logic and underwhelming scientific rigour. I will give it 4/5 on account of me enjoying the ideas. These ideas, however, convince me to the extent of them ""making sense"". As a scientist I do expect much more in order to be convinced. I understand that this would make the book significantly longer and it might not necessarily be aimed for the ""general public"", but I would argue that here we don't really see the case of oversimplification being the issue, since the ideas, terminology, methodology described etc. are not necessarily ""dumbed down"". Instead, there is a certain haughty attitude - judging by this book alone, everybody other than the authors thinks genetic changes in human beings stopped 40,000 years ago and is wholly dogmatic. "
96,0465002218,http://goodreads.com/user/show/77887124-paul-clark,1,"This book rejects the view that race is primarily a social construct and proposes five hypotheses about genetic differences between ethnic groups. The first two, lactose tolerance and resistance to pathogens, are physiological and uncontroversial. The same cannot be said of the other three: that interbreeding between Eurasians and Neanderthals increased Eurasian intelligence, that long-term exposure to agriculture leads to a greater predisposition to the ‘bourgeois’ values of hard work and restraint, and that medieval restrictions on Ashkenazi Jews raised their intelligence. This review will focus on these three hypotheses.THE NEANDERTHAL ADVANTAGEHomo sapiens first encountered Neanderthals after leaving Africa 40,000 years ago. Cochran and Harpending speculate that interbreeding between the two species raised Eurasian intelligence, triggering the Upper Palaeolithic revolution in technology, symbolic behaviour and socio-economic organisation. Quite how sub-Saharan Africans later managed the same transition to modern behaviour without the benefit of Neanderthal DNA, the authors do not say.In any case, many archaeologists favour non-genetic explanations for the transition. Others argue that it occurred in Africa much earlier, citing discoveries like a large 70,000 year-old settlement in Sudan and sophisticated 44,000 year-old southern African artefacts. If critics of the Upper Palaeolithic model turn out to be correct, Cochran and Harpending’s highly speculative hypothesis would be falsified.THE AGRICULTURAL REVOLUTION AND BOURGEOIS VALUESThe authors claim that the development of agriculture led to the spread of genes for hard work and restraint among those populations in the Middle East, East Asia and Europe that have been exposed to agriculture for longest.Whilst superficially convincing, their account has serious flaws. The most glaring is the claim that ADHD has been bred out of China, where it actually affects up to 5% of schoolchildren. Other claims presented as facts are in reality matters of dispute. Agriculture might have arisen in sub-Saharan Africa 1,000 years earlier than the authors state, and their claim that Australian Aborigines never developed agriculture is contested.In most pre-capitalist societies, hard work did not have the significance the authors give it because any attempt to rise above your station was seen as sinful and peasants generally did as little work as they could get away with. The way people accumulated wealth was to squeeze it out of someone else as a warlord, a landlord or the holder of a sinecure that enabled them to milk others.Traders who acquired wealth through hard work dreamed of turning it into land, finding an impoverished noble family to marry into and putting their feet up. The only ones unable to do this were religious minorities like Armenians, Jews, Lebanese and Parsees. Cochran and Harpending claim that bourgeois genes made these communities successful middlemen when in fact it was their minority religion that trapped them in this niche.Similarly dubious is the claim that a lack of bourgeois genes fuels opposition to neo-liberalism in Latin America. Surely the growth of the industrial working class is a better explanation for the influence of socialism there.The authors contrast farmers who refrain from eating their seed corn with hunter gatherers who scupper efforts to turn them into herders by eating all their goats. But are hunter gatherers really so stupid? Or is this a case of a top-down innovation deliberately sabotaged by a community that never wanted it?The claim that aggression has been bred out of those populations longest exposed to agriculture is undermined by Cohen and Nisbett’s famous study that found startling differences in levels of aggression between genetically indistinguishable people from different cultures.THE INTELLIGENCE OF AHKANAZI JEWSCochran and Harpending’s third controversial hypothesis concerns the high IQs of Ashkenazi Jews, allegedly 12-15 points above other Europeans. They favour the theory that this is genetically determined because medieval north European Jews were restricted to white-collar occupations, particularly money lending, in which only intelligent people could succeed, giving them greater reproductive success in a community where marrying out was forbidden.However, the data they present is superficial. The influence of heritability on IQ shifts during a person’s life, rising dramatically as children grow to adulthood. But the authors never give the ages of the people in their statistics, making them impossible to assess.Their claim that 80% of economically active medieval Ashkenazim were full-time moneylenders is unconvincing, since Jews were confined to ghettoes with separate micro-economies, and rules forbidding the ‘improper subordination’ of Christians by Jews would probably have created the need for a Jewish servant class.Despite these caveats, this hypothesis is credible if unproven. There is no a priori reason why the heritable intelligence of every ethnic group should be the same and the Ashkenazim are a genetically closed community with a unique history.CONCLUSIONSThe 10,000 Year Explosion makes noteworthy points about physiological differences between the races and asks an interesting question about the intelligence of Ashkenazi Jews without quite supplying the answer. But it has conspicuously failed to demonstrate any other link between race and either intelligence or character. Cochran and Harpending’s Neanderthal hypothesis is highly speculative, and their claims about bourgeois values and agriculture rest on questionable evidence and a willingness to ignore simpler and more obvious explanations.Please see my website for a longer and fully sourced version of this review."
97,0465002218,http://goodreads.com/user/show/84499280-david-baer,4,"I got worried reading the introduction, because (among many others) they thanked Phil Rushton, who I remember from a lifetime ago as being in the news in a bad way, as in using his research to either promote or implicitly support racist ideologies. But I continued anyway, because I find the subject matter fascinating.Because, as I opined in my review of Before the Dawn: Recovering the Lost History of Our Ancestors, it's not by definition racist to inquire into the genetic basis of racial variation - it's only racist if you use such inquiry to justify privilege for one group, or even to consider one group as inherently superior to another. So, for example, it's not racist to find the genetic basis for why Kenyans are so successful at long-distance running. It is racist to conclude from that fact, that, I don't know, say, ""driving while black"" isn't really a thing. Or that separation of the ""races"" is a good thing, etc etc.This book isn't racist, in my opinion - but I understand how it could come off as such. The thing about Ashkenazi Jews having enhanced intelligence has a certain taint to it, because it's been used to justify (racist) hierarchies of the ""races"". And this thing about the Ashkenazi Jews comes up again and again: because they experienced unique conditions of repression in northern Europe for a thousand years, those who could really be successful in intellectually challenging roles such as (principally) money-lending, were more reproductively successful. So there is a lot of evidence presented, and I buy it, and I don't believe I am racist for buying it, but still - there are a lot of racists who also buy it, and that makes me a bit uncomfortable.Even though the book has a lot of footnotes and a good bibliography, I felt the authors did a poor job of constructing arguments. It seemed they were all over the place, all the time - promising answers and then discursively wandering away from what they promised to answer, never getting back to it. Like on page 91 we are told ""we now understand quite a bit about the genetic changes that led to light skin in northern Eurasians."" Wow! That's a big statement; I was prepared for a big explanation. But a dozen pages of stuff later, they were moving on to another topic; I carefully re-read the intervening pages, which were all quite interesting, but I confirmed that they definitely never delivered on their promised explanation of skin color.I give it 4 stars because I love the subject matter and am fascinated by the implications of the fact that all modern people emerged from a small African population of humans who lived about 50kya. Our written history is so microscopic compared to all of what must have happened - just to know what we can infer from genetics to fill in the blanks is amazing.

This takes a genetic perspective on history and archaeology, benefiting from the vast improvement in the science and technology of genomic knowledge. Organisms, including people, adapt to changing environments, and our environment is changing radically, starting with the Upper Paleolithic, the introduction of farming, settling into towns, domesticating animals (including milk-yielding species), the vast increase in the number of humans and consequent breeding ground for infectious diseases, literacy and numeracy and their contribution to human prospering for those that could excel at them, and so on. A fascinating book, with some safe and interesting insights, but not shying away from more controversial hypotheses, such as the contributions of proto-humans, such as Neanderthals and Denisovans, to modern humans, with their longer-term adaptations to living in northern climes, possibly contributing lighter skin and other features."

Arguments from natural selection are used to explain patterns in world history, including Europeans' success in displacing Amerindians in the Americas and their failure to displace Africans in the tropical parts of that continent. It's a quick read, and very enlightening.While the authors make their case very clearly, I would have liked to see them explore whether modern medical science -- or demographics in general -- has weakened the link between ""reproductive fitness"" and actual numbers of descendants. Given that so much infectious disease can be treated or controlled, quality food and good sanitation are abundant, and many very ""reproductively fit"" people choose to have small families (or none at all), does their thesis still apply? Will the next 10,000 years be like the last 10,000 were?"

The tens of thousands of years since we left Africa were not enough for evolution to do anything more than tweak us around the edges and the time since the agricultural revolution is a mere blink of an evolutionary eye and human evolution has more or less slowed to a crawl.The 10,000 Year Explosion is evolutionary psychology dialed up to 11. Rather than slowing down, evolution has actually sped up. Genetic change was responsible not just for the agricultural revolution but the scientific and industrial revolutions too, not to mention the rise and fall of empires. Examples of candidate mutations abound. The sum of the books arguments, though was unconvincing. "

The authors lays out evolutionary thinking in such a way that the reader will by the end of the book feel a lot more confident in her understanding of the world. It should truly be read by everyone.The book can be read by anyone without any prior knowledge on evolutionary theory. The minimum level of the book is high-school.

The concept of a variant on 'artificial selection' as is observed for dogs and other domesticated animals and plants, seems suggested although not explicit. This seems based on advantages for particular populations, with more offspring among those with particular genetic traits and cultural adaptations such as herding, farming, urbanization, domestic animals such as horses, and improved military weaponry. Pretty persuasive that the process seems ongoing."

Then I brought the book with me on my trips to Chengdu with parents and reading became on and off and hard to concentrate. So the middle part of the book is a bit lost to me. Then I returned home and read the last chapter about why a branch of Jews (German Jews) are super smart while bearing more genetic diseases really really interesting and I learned a lot.

116,0465002218,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12991284-jeremy,3,"As a long time reader of science books I was immediately attracted to this book due to its great title – titles are important, take note publishers. The last science book I read was the great The Fifth Miracle by Paul Davies, which was an examination of how life evolved. Cochran and Harpending’s book promised an argument against the long held theory that humans stopped evolving fifty thousand years ago, just after emerging out of Africa. The book describes itself as the “…the latest edition to the fast emerging discipline of biohistory.” There’s been quite a bit of news related to this area lately, so I thought that it was time to give it a read.The book opens with a refutation of “conventional wisdom”, with the authors claiming that human evolution has accelerated in the last ten thousand years due to various selection pressures, such as agriculture, geographic expansion and climate change. They go on to examine the period that started fifty to forty thousand years ago when modern humans moved into the European territories of the Neanderthal. Ten thousand years later the Neanderthal were extinct and humans were flourishing. No one knows for sure but it seems that humans displayed better adaptations such as advanced language, tools and hunting techniques. There is convincing genetic evidence that we interbreed with Neanderthals and picked up and kept various advantageous genes – just ask Ozzy Osbourne. The ensuing four chapters examine the impact of the advent of agriculture some ten thousand years ago and how the changes to what we ate affected our genetic makeup; the genetic flow of humanity as expressed by selective sweeps of particular genes and also the impact of expansion on humans throughout the globe. A succinct summary - but if you want to know the facts then read the book! But is it worth reading?The ideas presented in The 10,000 Year Explosion are certainly well argued. The authors blend history, archaeology, paleontology and biology to weave their arguments convincingly. They refer to their work as “genetic history” – a “new kind of history.” This is all very well but unfortunately the flaw of this book is that the writing style is relatively bland. There is an effort to engage and give the facts some personality, but as interested as I was in the arguments presented I often found myself bored. I believe that writing popular science is a tricky thing, because, after all, you don’t want to dumb it down; but also you don’t want to put the average reader off either. After reading this book I appreciate science writers such as Paul Davies and Marcus Chown for their efforts to both explain and engage.The 10,000 Year Explosion ends with a case study of the Ashkenazi Jews – Jews that were confined to Europe from medieval times and that were restricted to money lending and clerical professions; the kind of jobs that required a certain level of intelligence. The combination of the demands of their profession and their tendency to marry within their faith meant that the European Jews were selected for a higher intelligence than Jews in the Middle East. Five hundred or so years later descendants of this group were making the major scientific breakthroughs throughout many disciplines and they also displayed higher IQs than other groups. A fascinating case study, but once again the bland writing created a nagging sense of boredom.The story of human evolution is an amazing tale to behold - one that’s obsessed me on and off for years. It’s compelling, fascinating and most of all it’s our story. Unfortunately this book does not really capture the sense of wonder that our story can engender, which is a shame. Read this book if you want the facts, but perhaps look elsewhere if you want to feel that elusive sense of wonder. Although I was slightly disappointed overall, the one interesting thing this book did do for me was to make me ponder just how our present point in human evolutionary history will be viewed in five hundred years; and that’s not such a bad thing."
117,0465002218,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17431775-schwarzenberger,3,"Considering the subject matter, it is a light read with a lot of little tidbits thrown in about how many relatives Genghis Khan has that are still living across central Asia, how disease really helped Pizarro and only 168 soldiers tear apart the Inca Empire, where blue eyes originated, and other such scientific matters that make great dinner conversation and cocktail party opening lines.By the way, i like the cover with the almost stroboscopic depiction of evolutionary influenced skeletal uprightness and locomotion. It is a grabber of a design that gets your eye from across the floor of the library or bookshop.The authors may not like this, but I am giving away a highly kept secret they mention in the index--Yes I actually do read indices, to me they give a sense of the real core of a book and let you know what the authors think is really important. If you have limited time perusing the index gets you right to the action. Well, in the index there is an entry--Lost Dutchman Mine, location, 400. I guess this means that one or both of the authors knows where this reputedly amazingly rich gold mine is hidden. It is a legend in its own right, I'm sure there are some good books about it and Wikipedia says people are still looking for it. The authors know where it is and they are telling you. It is all on page 400! However, my paperback edition (2010) only has 288 pages including the index. It's a wonderfully hidden joke that I did not see mentioned in any other review. I guess we'll have to wait another 10,000 years for the ""20,000 Year Explosion"" followup edition that will explain how humans have evolved since the demise of print books, audio CDs, broadcast television, sidewalks and other signs of civilization. Hopefully this newer edition will have a page 400.To me this was a fascinating read. ""Explosion"" discusses human genetics and evolution, a subject that I have found interesting for a long time but have not actually had the patience to really delve into in order to get a comprehensive basis for true knowledge--I feel that it would take a little more time than I want to dedicate to find out more about organic chemistry and processes of how organic molecules act and react with other to make up DNA mechanisms, and how that affects how life works etc. I did tackle ""The Eight Day of Creation"" some decades ago...what I read of it was fascinating but then life's personal activities got in the way. But the thing that really stopped me was that I kept the used copy (It cost only 1 dollar) of the book I bought on a back shelf for about 10 years and then when I finally started reading it and got a little more than half way through--it is an 800 page monster--I realized that it was mis-bound and many pages were duplicated but also very mixed up and completely out of order. More importantly, a lot was missing overall and the local library didn't have a copy that that could be loaned out to read. I was not going to sit in the library and work my way through it. So basically, that's now where I left my knowledge of genes and DNA and alleles and the mechanics of genetics.That said, I did appreciate the simplification in general that the authors made to get their point across. That point is that we are still evolving, our physiology is still reacting to the environment around us trying to adapt us in the best way possible to allow for species survival and thriving. It's a good read and will get me to read more about this subject. Parts of their theses reminded me of Julian Jaynes' book with that wonderful title--""The Development of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind"" and his theory that we humans finally realized that it wasn't the Gods talking to each and every one of us, it was just our brains finally melding messages together across the corpus callosum inside each of our skulls."
118,0465002218,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1219617-erik,3,"Cochran and Harpending dispel the long-held scientific notion that human evolution reached a plateau tens of thousands of years ago, as well as all change has been cultural. Instead, they argue that cultural change has effected genetic change, and vice versa. Not only did agriculture select for certain characteristics – like lactose tolerance as a result of animal husbandry, for one – but so introgression with Neanderthals, which has been historically frowned upon in the scientific community due to biased in favor of the notion homo sapiens purity. ""The explosion is ongoing: Human evolution didn’t stop when anatomically modern humans appeared, or when they expanded out of Africa. It never stopped – and why would it? Evolutionary stasis requires a static environment, whereas behavioral modernity is all about innovation and change. Stability is exactly what we have not had. This should be obvious, but instead the human sciences have labored under the strange idea that evolution stopped 40,000 years ago.""One of their most controversial notions is their well-supported argument that the Ashkenazi Jews of Eastern Europe have a genetic propensity for higher intelligence as a direct result of marriage only within their community combined with societal pressures against intermarriage with gentiles, strict limitations on what kinds of white-collars jobs they could hold (banking, finance, science), and the resulting economic rewards for succeeding economically (higher birth rate, better heated homes, more personal privacy in those homes that helped thwart contact with diseases fatal to the more impoverished, etc.). All of these combined set the conditions for natural selection that resulted in a better-educated and genetically-insular population with a slightly higher-than-average IQ when compared to the other European genetic groups that they lived alongside. Perhaps this is a stretch for the politically correct crowd, but it certainly is worthy of reasoned debate and consideration. (On the flip side, Cochran and Harpending are quick to remind us that the Ashkenazi Jews also have an accompanying genetic predisposition for various diseases that other groups do not have.)As an educator, I was particularly struck by their assertion that ""Nongenetic factors also influence IQ, but for the most part, the ones that matter are not the ones people thought would matter. Prenatal care, breastfeeding, nutrition, access to early education, Mozart in the womb, and oat bran all have little or no effect. Surprisingly, the way in which a family raised children seems to have no effect on adult IQ.""Alas, neither Cochran nor Harpending go on to detail just what nongenetic factors can or do influence IQ. (I would argue that the quality of formal education be one.)On a style note, I admit to wishing several times for either Richard Dawkins or Jared Diamond’s more persuasive and personable narrative styles. (No surprise, Diamond’s Guns, Germs, and Steel and The Third Chimpanzee are both quoted numerous times.) Of course, knowing that this is the first book between the Cochran and Harpending, I imagine that they will both improve in this area in future books the co-write. "
119,0465002218,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4975079-daniel-hammer,4,"This is just the kind of exciting, accessible and provocative science that I like to read about. For the most part. Cochran and Harpending's book presents the argument that human evolution has increased in pace over the last 10,000 years. This is in contrast to a more standard view which argues that, due to the ability to culturally and technologically reshape our environment, modern human beings have less of a need to evolve biologically in response to environmental pressures. He begins with a few basics of populations genetic which support the likelihood of an increased rate of evolution in recent times. Among these are the increase in human population numbers; more people equals more chances for mutations to develop. Also important is the fact that our diets have changed more in the past 10,000 years than had hominin diets for the previous several million years. This would have introduced significant dietary pressures on us, and those who could tolerate or process certain foods (such as lactose) would be more evolutionarily successful. 10,000 years ago is a key starting point because it corresponds with the advent of agriculture, which introduced larger populations, new diets, crowded living, and more.Cochran and Harpending survey a range or very interesting ideas. They argue that humans almost definitely bred with Neanderthals. That lactose tolerance was a key to the spread of Indo-European languages, via the adaptable, milk-drinking people which spoke those tongues. They examine a number of genetic mutations which are limited to certain populations and reflect recent genetic (evolutionary) responses to environment and diet, like sickle-cell trait. They suggest that light skin color may have evolved for more than just the ability to synthesize more vitamin D, and that the human brain likely underwent important structural changes just in the past 30,000 years.All of this is seriously interesting, and a pleasure to read and debate. The downside is that Cochran and Harpending are slim on evidence for much of this. I an inclined to believe they are largely correct, but too often the book reads like a laundry list of exciting suggestions, without much to back them up.This book certainly worth a quick read and makes some great food for thought."
120,0465002218,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19773041-joseph-hirsch,3,"Depending on a whole host of factors (your scientific background, religion, personal experiences, and biases, to name a few) one could come away from ""The 10,000 Year Explosion"" thinking that anthropologist Greg Cochran is an intellectually voracious man who wants to know where and how humans differ in their genes in order to cure diseases and increase social harmony, or conversely, that he is a latter-day Cesare Lombroso who wants to bust out the calipers to measure our heads to find out which of us have seed worth saving for his eugenic experiments and which of us need to undergo forced sterilization.Having read his ""10,000 Year Explosion"" written by Cochran in conjunction with geneticist Henry Harpending, I found the authors to be intelligent, humorous men capable of explaining very, very complicated concepts in a way that did not scare off this layman. The problem I had with the book was not some kind of moral objection (science doesn't care about my feelings) but rather the nagging sense that this was a paper or presentation stretched out to book length, and that any one of the ideas explicated in the book in one chapter would have made a great book in itself. Dr (?) Cochran cites Jared Diamond's ""Guns, Germs, and Steel"" multiple times throughout the book; I just wish he'd taken the same sort of ""deep dive"" approach to this book in terms of its structure and breadth. In brief (and it's hard to be brief with this information) Cochran argues that human evolution did not stop roughly 40,000 years ago as many believe, and that evolution is an ongoing process, and that this process can ""explode"" in a very local and idiosyncratic way, based on everything from rigorous man-made laws (especially regarding things like out-marriage) to civic arrangements (one of the more disturbing but fascinating detours in the book holds that once humans shifted from hunter-gatherers to agrarians, we started to favor the conforming and even servile over the independent and strong).Someone, in an attempt to summarize this book, called it something like an exploration of history through the lens of genetics, which would be a pretty good capitulation. The authors take the reader from ancient Asian Steppes where Mongol hordes perfected a simple but effective reproduction strategy (kill the men and mate with the women), all the way forward in time to an Israeli hospital in the twenty-first, where the idea that genetic advantages can become disadvantages or can even be made irrelevant is explored. As previously mentioned, all of the subjects dealt with are fascinating, and presented in a clear manner. But it's a bit too thumbnail for my taste. Your take might differ. I'd certainly take a class with Dr. Cochran, though, if I were still in college. I imagine it would be easy to stay awake during his seminars. "
121,0465002218,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32156837-mike,5,"This is a fascinating book on the mutual influence of genes on culture and of culture on genes. The ""explosion"" referred to in the title was the advent of agriculture, which greatly multiplied the size of the human population, greatly altered culture, and redirected human evolution down new paths to adapt to this new culture. When human population increased the rate of genetic mutations increased correspondingly, which increased the rate of evolution (by 100 fold according to the authors). Humans, especially those in densely populated areas, have been evolving rapidly in the last 10,000 years--and their evolution is driven by their environment, including their culture. But, then, newly evolved humans, being different from their ancestors, develop different cultural environments more suitable to their nature. Thus, evolution and human culture form a feedback loop. Of course, in a world of relatively isolated regional and local populations, their will be different natural/cultural environments, hence differential evolution to adapt to them. Inuit amidst ice flows and tundra would not (and did not) evolve the same way as Melanesians on their tropical islands. And evolution may proceed quite rapidly under certain circumstances, particularly large population size and major environmental impetus. On top of well supported scientific theory, the authors add numerous examples of evolution-culture interaction throughout history. It's an important new perspective on history. The style of writing is clear, needless academic jargon wisely jettisoned. The historical examples that run through the book seem somewhat arbitrarily chosen, but, this being a relatively new field of inquiry, the authors are probably just following the trail of such evidence as we currently have. The newness also means we face some uncertainties of interpretation. The authors note evidential limitations when present, but are bold to cast forth their nets in some clever speculations, one of which has been confirmed since publication (non-African humans have some Neanderthal DNA). This is what scientists do and are meant to do when faced with uncertainty: formulate hypotheses, preferably intelligent, informed ones. In this book, we have something of a hybrid beast: a populist approach with some vanguard hypothesizing. "
122,0465002218,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5466619-naftoli,5,"This book has opened my eyes to so many issues; to say that it is transformative is understatement. I had been taught in college that human evolution stopped with the advent of culture, that culture made adjustments to the environment thus eliminating the need for biology to fine tune our bodies. I had also been trained to view IQ tests as simply racist tools used by white patriarchal society to convince the priveleged that minority people are inferior - it sounds hyperbolic but I was actually told this by professors! I had also been taught that all humans are essentially the same (one world, one people, that race is only skin deep). When confronted with differences in intelligence, adaptability, etc. I was taught that this is due to political inequities, war, in short, culture. This book challenges these biases. I will no doubt read this book again at some later date and refer to it from time to time. I am not trained as a scientist so I will have to review and re-review the data from time to time. I was trained as a social scientist - cultural anthropology - so I am the target audience for this book. The issue regarding Neanderthals and what became of them is one of the first issues undertaken in this work; I found it to be both realistic and reasonable. The authors rely on population genetics, mathematics, extrapolations, &c in an effort to buttress their position that modern humans have inherited a small but important percentage of Neanderthal genetic material. It makes sense to me.Among so many things, I admire the authors for having the courage to challenge our current received wisdom. It seems to me that they have taken quite a risk in doing so as there is nothing 'politically correct' about this book. The authors even point to data that most writers shy away from as it may cast them in a negative light. Whatever the reason for shying away from data, it is vital that we humans look facts straight in the face and deal with the realities of our evolution, our cultural wisdom and ethnocentricities, and our impact upon this planet. At the minimum, debate these issues rather than labeling and dismissing them. This book tackles a few of these issues."
123,0465002218,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4534780-alina,5,"The old thinking is that, when cultural evolution took off, biological evolution stopped -- because instead of being shaped by our environment, we began shaping our environment to us. That idea always seemed reasonable to me, but this book has changed my mind. The authors contend that, on the contrary, evolution has sped up since the neolithic revolution. The social innovations associated with agriculture and civilization mean we have subjected ourselves to major new environmental pressures, and that has fueled rapid natural selection. Their idea is that cultural evolution interacts with biological evolution; the two drive each other. One of the book's points is that natural selection isn't as slow as is often believed, since altering just one gene or even one nucleotide can sometimes result in important advantages. By examining evidence from the exploding field of population genetics, as well as other sources, the authors find indications of significant biological change in the past 10,000 years or so. Examples include differing disease resistance in response to local conditions, the development of lactose tolerance in dairy farmers, and selection for higher intelligence among Ashkenazi Jews. Although I'd heard of some of these things before, I hadn't appreciated the impact on history. The authors make a convincing case that genetic factors can be decisive. I no longer think of biological evolution as something that stopped being important once modern humans came into existence."

Agriculture really played a very big role to form the whole new civilization, people settled down, with more food to grow more population, so were the diseases followed ( Animal husbandry kept them moving around, the diseases could not followed with the climate difference that easily). People gather up would also start to form commerce, society and strict hierarchy and government.below i copied the part i found interesting : Ashkenazi jewish. 那么为何德系犹太人特别聪慧呢？想要解答这个谜题，或许我们可以看看关于阿什肯纳兹犹太人的DNA我们都知道些什么，因为事实证明它们还有另一个有趣的特征。即，它们有一组不常见的严重遗传病，例如家族性黑蒙性痴呆症、高雪氏病、家族性自主神经功能异常，以及两种不同形式的遗传性乳腺癌（BRCA1和BRCA2），这些疾病在阿什肯纳兹犹太人群体中的发病率比在其他欧洲人群中高将近100倍。我们相信这两个谜题有单一的解释。我们认为阿什肯纳兹犹太人在北欧逗留的时期在白领职业的自然选择中获得了成功，而这成功源自他们智力上的遗传优势。但对于智力的强势选择也产生了一些让人不愉快的副作用：提高遗传携带者智商的等位基因同时也对纯合体产生损害。这一类解释自然是有争议的。事实上很多人排斥这一类说法：智力是可测量的，由遗传决定的，不同的人类群体间有智力上的差异。有趣的是，这些批评和斥责甚少来自从事认知测试及其结果分析的科学工作者。业内对此很少或几乎没有任何争议，智商测试是准确的，测试结果能预测学术成就和个体生活的其他方面，而且智商值有极高的遗传率。如果遗传的确能影响智力，那么一段时间后，智力带来的繁殖优势必然会带来更高的智力。这个简单的逻辑是关于自然选择的演化理论的核心：能增加繁殖的基因在人类群体中会随时间推移变得越来越常见。.................我们认为印欧扩张起始于乳糖耐受突变的频率增高，当其频率增高至足以使整个人群转型从事制乳业经济的时候，印欧人就迅速扩散至整个南俄大草原。这迅速的扩张就有可能导致说近似语言的同一人群分散在从当今的乌克兰直到乌拉尔河地区这一广阔区域。因为扩张如此迅速，语言还没有分化，所以这一广大区域中分散的人群说的还是相似的语言。印欧人前进的步伐持续至进入欧洲，在那里制乳业在生态学效应上足以跟早期农业竞争，而且前者催生了一种远远更具侵略性的文化。印欧文化很可能是更好战的，因为印欧人群的高机动性、更多的人口数量和更好的营养使他们能比其他人群更经常赢得战争。而他们的胜利反过来又会提升他们的军事行动效率，从而成功哺育了更多成功。从印欧人基因在欧洲基因库占的相对低的比例来看，他们似乎实行的是精英统治，做被征服人群的统治者但没有摧毁或替代原先的居住者。然而相对小的精英人口常常能够让所有其余人口说他们的语言。此外，印欧人还把乳糖耐受的等位基因加进了本地的混合基因库。乳糖耐受突变在印欧人入侵前的欧洲很罕见或根本不存在，然而当制乳业受自然选择青睐的时候，它就在欧洲变得很常见了，特别是在北欧。[20]印欧语言和文化在制乳业流行的地域传播扩散，比方说，它们还进入了南欧和伊朗，然而中东的强势国家们似乎阻止了这些语言文化进入中东。我们认为印欧扩张起始于乳糖耐受突变的频率增高，当其频率增高至足以使整个人群转型从事制乳业经济的时候，印欧人就迅速扩散至整个南俄大草原。这迅速的扩张就有可能导致说近似语言的同一人群分散在从当今的乌克兰直到乌拉尔河地区这一广阔区域。因为扩张如此迅速，语言还没有分化，所以这一广大区域中分散的人群说的还是相似的语言。印欧人前进的步伐持续至进入欧洲，在那里制乳业在生态学效应上足以跟早期农业竞争，而且前者催生了一种远远更具侵略性的文化。印欧文化很可能是更好战的，因为印欧人群的高机动性、更多的人口数量和更好的营养使他们能比其他人群更经常赢得战争。而他们的胜利反过来又会提升他们的军事行动效率，从而成功哺育了更多成功。从印欧人基因在欧洲基因库占的相对低的比例来看，他们似乎实行的是精英统治，做被征服人群的统治者但没有摧毁或替代原先的居住者。然而相对小的精英人口常常能够让所有其余人口说他们的语言。此外，印欧人还把乳糖耐受的等位基因加进了本地的混合基因库。乳糖耐受突变在印欧人入侵前的欧洲很罕见或根本不存在，然而当制乳业受自然选择青睐的时候，它就在欧洲变得很常见了，特别是在北欧。[20]印欧语言和文化在制乳业流行的地域传播扩散，比方说，它们还进入了南欧和伊朗，然而中东的强势国家们似乎阻止了这些语言文化进入中东。.......一开始他们是作为基督教与穆斯林世界的中介的国际商人。然而随着穆斯林和基督徒（特别是意大利人）逐渐开始直接通商，阿什肯纳兹犹太商人越来越多地开始从事本地贸易。当对犹太人的迫害越来越严重从而长距离旅行无法得到安全保障之后，德系犹太人越来越专注于金融业，这个行业对他们是敞开的，因为基督徒被禁止放高利贷。在公元1100年前绝大部分德系犹太人都是放贷者，这一模式延续了几个世纪。[15]这些职业（交易和金融业）有很高的智商需求，我们可以肯定没有其他人类群体有这么高数量比例的人口在长时段内从事需要很高认知能力的职业。有时我们能找到相当详尽的阿什肯纳兹犹太人的商业活动记录。比如关于南法鲁西永犹太人在约公元1270年就有这样的记录：“有全面证据证明这群犹太人以放贷为生，实质上完全没有从事任何其他种类的经济活动。有记录的228名男性犹太人中近八成在向他们的基督教邻居放贷。犹太女人（几乎都是寡妇）放贷的也很常见，这些来自弱势者的资本被投资到相似的渠道。并且最积极从事放贷的犹太人似乎在他们的群体内是最受尊崇的。................他们曾是波兰立陶宛王国的管理者阶层。除了读写能力之外，在这些特定职业上取得成功所依靠的是类似于现今商人的素质，至少也需要有追踪复杂交易和资金流动的能力。最终，随着波兰立陶宛王国的阿什肯纳兹犹太人人口数量上升，越来越多的犹太人成了手工艺者——毕竟对管理和金融职业的需求也是有一定限度的。然而在800到900年的时间段内，也就是大致从公元800年到公元1650或1700年，绝大部分的阿什肯纳兹犹太人从事的是管理和金融业，也就是复杂度很高的职业，他们几乎从来不当农民和匠人。在这个方面他们和所有其他定居人口都有所不同。事实上，在那个时代任何占有领地的人类族群都不可能有那么高比例的人口从事白领职业，因为这样农业生产率就会过低。九成的人口都必须务农，从而生产足够的粮食去养活他们自己和社会顶层少量的统治者、文员、士兵、匠人以及商人。对白领职业的自然选择只有在这一阶层独自成为一个族群的时候才有可能成功，这一族群必须靠职业而非其据地而界定。在高复杂度职业中取得成功的犹太人享有更高的遗传优势。学者怀里波说：“在富裕的家庭中有更多的孩子能活到成年。总体上属于更富裕阶层的许多商业领袖、显赫拉比、群体领袖和类似个体的谱系显示，这些人通常有4个、6个甚至8～9个孩子活到成年。........智商有很高的可遗传性。这意味着一个个体的智商值会部分取决于遗传影响，从而更接近他或她的父母和兄弟姐妹而不是随便哪个别人。同一对父母生下的子女即便在不同环境下养大也会有相近的智商值，而领养的兄弟姐妹即便在同一屋檐下长大也不会有相近的智商值。高度也是类似的：长得高的人更可能有高于平均身高的子女。事实上，成年人的智商值与身高一样主要受遗传因素影响。然而童年的智商值却受遗传影响更少，而更容易受周围环境影响。周围环境对儿童智商测试结果的影响会在青春期期间或其后消失，这成了美国先锋计划（Head Start Program）的基础，即宣扬智商值能因一定干预而提高。非遗传因素同样会影响智商值，但很多情况下那些起作用的因素都不是人们想象会起作用的因素。父母关爱、母乳喂养、营养情况、早教、子宫中听莫扎特音乐和燕麦麸几乎都没起什么作用。而让人惊讶的是，一个家庭养育孩子的方式看起来对孩子成年时的智商值没有任何影响。这有效地反驳了一些流行的环境决定论——它们对阿什肯纳兹犹太人的高智商做各种成长环境方面的解释，尤其反驳了那些认为犹太母亲用特殊的方式抚养孩子催发了他们的高智商的论调。...在阿什肯纳兹犹太人特别高发的遗传病中，广为人知的是家族性黑蒙性痴呆症、高雪氏病和BRCA1与BRCA2乳腺癌突变，但同时还有许多其他的疾病，比如尼曼匹克症、卡纳万病和家族性自主神经功能异常。有些会引起神经方面的问题。它们在阿什肯纳兹犹太人身上特别高发，这已经成了人类遗传学上一个长久的谜题。.....是什么样的性征在阿什肯纳兹犹太人身上比在他们的邻居身上更宝贵呢？嗯，我们有一些很强的线索。是什么性征在当今的德系犹太人身上最突出呢？他们是壮大如萨摩亚人，高如图西族人，以及牛奶耐受如荷兰人吗？不是的，他们的特殊性征就是智力。这些突变体本身就提示了这一点：它们中的一些看起来就很像会提高智商的，考虑到它们作用于中枢神经系统的发展。鞘脂类突变体特别有可能具有提升智力的作用。在每一种这类突变体中，都有一些特定鞘脂累积；这些鞘脂是变更过的脂类分子，它们在信号传输中起作用，并在神经组织中特别常见。研究者已经确定这些鞘脂类作用水平的提升会引致神经元（中枢神经系统的基本细胞）之间更多的连接（高雪氏病的轴突生长）。在家族性黑蒙性痴呆症的情形中有相似的效应：特定的累积混合物（GM2神经节苷脂）作用水平提升会促进树突（连接神经元的纤细多分支突起）的增长。[41]这种树突生成的增加现象也同样发生在A型尼曼匹克细胞出现、动物版黑蒙性痴呆症和尼曼匹克病的情形下。这些都是已知的疾病等位基因中唯一能引致神经连接增加的因素。我们同时还有（并不确凿的）证据证明德系犹太人身上常见的一些基因变异有可能提升智力。我们研究了耶路撒冷高雪氏病患者的职业——实际上是所有在耶路撒冷沙尔泽德克医学中心（Shaare Zedek Medical Centre）治疗的患者。这些患者成为工程师或科学家的概率比以色列阿什肯纳兹犹太人从事这些职业的平均概率要高很多，事实上大概要高11倍。[42]关于阿什肯纳兹犹太人的另一种遗传病扭转性肌张力障碍也有类似的研究结果。这种遗传病最初被诊断出来的时候，研究者就已经开始注意到其患者不同寻常的智力水平。.....结论文化革新在很长的时间里都是人类生物学变化的驱动力，在约250万年前人类开始使用工具之后就一直如此。自然选择青睐那些从事早期文化革新的原始人类大脑，而这些革新本身就导向更多身体和心理上的变化。生物学特征和文化特征的协同演化一开始是很缓慢的，至少以现代标准看是慢的，但渐渐演化速度就快起来了。考古学记录显示我们的革新能力持续上升，直至约4万年前，我们已经为所谓的“人类革命”或旧石器时代晚期欧洲和亚洲北部的“创造性大爆发”蓄势待发。技术和艺术的突然兴盛发生在人类扩张并走出非洲的不久以后；它同时也跟生物学变化有关，而我们猜想这些生物学变化部分是由从尼安德特人或其他远古人类（亚洲大陆更早的占据者）身上偷得的基因驱动的。行为现代化导致更多的变化：人类制作更精良的工具，然后他们在数代人的时间里也反过来被这些工具不断塑造变化。农业出现之后，文化和生物演化都加速了，因为新的生活方式使人们有了新的需求。农业出现以前人类一直都是觅食者：农业带来的人口急剧增加使得更多有益的变异体出现，也使得更多新想法出现。我们人类在农业传播后的快速演化的确是一万年的爆发。 这爆发如今还在持续：人类演化并没有止步于解剖学意义上的现代人类出现，或他们扩张走出非洲的时候。它从来没有停止。而且它怎么会停下呢？演化停滞需要一个静滞的环境，而行为现代化一直带来的都是革新和变化。一直以来我们都不曾有稳定和静滞的环境。这一点应该是很明显的，然而人类科学不仅忽视了它，相反还一直在一个奇怪的前提下辛勤地做研究，这个奇怪的想法认为演化在4万年前就停止了。 所有这些都意味着也必然意味着，生物变化是驱动历史的重要因素。当然它不是唯一的因素，而且很奇怪的是，它还被与更传统的影响绑定在一起。诸如乳糖耐受一类的遗传变化的出现和传播是文化革新（例如农业的发展）的结果，它同时也源自随机出现的合适的突变。这些遗传变化反过来也对文化产生了影响。印欧人的扩张，欧洲人在北美和澳大利亚的成功定居，“瓜分非洲”的失败，阿什肯纳兹犹太人进入智力舞台，甚至有可能工业革命和科学的兴起，所有这些看来都是生物和文化变化之永恒的舞步所营造的。 如果人类科学的研究者们继续忽略自然选择从未停止作用这一事实，他们就会把许多重要问题的解答线索给丢掉，把谜题变成秘密。科尔特斯带着500人就征服并控制了几百万人的帝国。想要解释这件事情而不提持续演化带来的疾病抵御机制中的生物学差异，这完全不可能。公元前5世纪的修昔底德说人类特征是不会变化的，所以可以预测，而当今许多科学家相信人类特征几万年前就停止了改变。历史学家们似乎一直以此为研究的前提。然而这样一来他们就忽略了巨大的契机，不仅在于解读人类的往昔，而且也在于塑造未来。贯穿人类历史的持续演化一直是一个巨大的自然界的实验，这个实验承诺了我们在理解自身、抵御疾病和精神病症方面的巨大的成果。利莫内苏尔加尔达隐藏着关于人类疾病的一个重要线索。世界上大概有100万个这样的小村庄，一定有更多类似的线索等待我们去发现。人类历史为我们展现的一些实验的成果甚至有可能帮助我们进行更有野心的尝试，去增加人类寿命和认知能力。从事人类科学的学者们是时候去甩掉一系列关于演化停止和“心理均一”的僵化教条了。每一刻时间都很宝贵，我们有一整个世界要去争取呢。"

I will give it 4/5 on account of me enjoying the ideas. These ideas, however, convince me to the extent of them ""making sense"". As a scientist I do expect much more in order to be convinced. I understand that this would make the book significantly longer and it might not necessarily be aimed for the ""general public"", but I would argue that here we don't really see the case of oversimplification being the issue, since the ideas, terminology, methodology described etc. are not necessarily ""dumbed down"". Instead, there is a certain haughty attitude - judging by this book alone, everybody other than the authors thinks genetic changes in human beings stopped 40,000 years ago and is wholly dogmatic. "
126,0465002218,http://goodreads.com/user/show/77887124-paul-clark,1,"This book rejects the view that race is primarily a social construct and proposes five hypotheses about genetic differences between ethnic groups. The first two, lactose tolerance and resistance to pathogens, are physiological and uncontroversial. The same cannot be said of the other three: that interbreeding between Eurasians and Neanderthals increased Eurasian intelligence, that long-term exposure to agriculture leads to a greater predisposition to the ‘bourgeois’ values of hard work and restraint, and that medieval restrictions on Ashkenazi Jews raised their intelligence. This review will focus on these three hypotheses.THE NEANDERTHAL ADVANTAGEHomo sapiens first encountered Neanderthals after leaving Africa 40,000 years ago. Cochran and Harpending speculate that interbreeding between the two species raised Eurasian intelligence, triggering the Upper Palaeolithic revolution in technology, symbolic behaviour and socio-economic organisation. Quite how sub-Saharan Africans later managed the same transition to modern behaviour without the benefit of Neanderthal DNA, the authors do not say.In any case, many archaeologists favour non-genetic explanations for the transition. Others argue that it occurred in Africa much earlier, citing discoveries like a large 70,000 year-old settlement in Sudan and sophisticated 44,000 year-old southern African artefacts. If critics of the Upper Palaeolithic model turn out to be correct, Cochran and Harpending’s highly speculative hypothesis would be falsified.THE AGRICULTURAL REVOLUTION AND BOURGEOIS VALUESThe authors claim that the development of agriculture led to the spread of genes for hard work and restraint among those populations in the Middle East, East Asia and Europe that have been exposed to agriculture for longest.Whilst superficially convincing, their account has serious flaws. The most glaring is the claim that ADHD has been bred out of China, where it actually affects up to 5% of schoolchildren. Other claims presented as facts are in reality matters of dispute. Agriculture might have arisen in sub-Saharan Africa 1,000 years earlier than the authors state, and their claim that Australian Aborigines never developed agriculture is contested.In most pre-capitalist societies, hard work did not have the significance the authors give it because any attempt to rise above your station was seen as sinful and peasants generally did as little work as they could get away with. The way people accumulated wealth was to squeeze it out of someone else as a warlord, a landlord or the holder of a sinecure that enabled them to milk others.Traders who acquired wealth through hard work dreamed of turning it into land, finding an impoverished noble family to marry into and putting their feet up. The only ones unable to do this were religious minorities like Armenians, Jews, Lebanese and Parsees. Cochran and Harpending claim that bourgeois genes made these communities successful middlemen when in fact it was their minority religion that trapped them in this niche.Similarly dubious is the claim that a lack of bourgeois genes fuels opposition to neo-liberalism in Latin America. Surely the growth of the industrial working class is a better explanation for the influence of socialism there.The authors contrast farmers who refrain from eating their seed corn with hunter gatherers who scupper efforts to turn them into herders by eating all their goats. But are hunter gatherers really so stupid? Or is this a case of a top-down innovation deliberately sabotaged by a community that never wanted it?The claim that aggression has been bred out of those populations longest exposed to agriculture is undermined by Cohen and Nisbett’s famous study that found startling differences in levels of aggression between genetically indistinguishable people from different cultures.THE INTELLIGENCE OF AHKANAZI JEWSCochran and Harpending’s third controversial hypothesis concerns the high IQs of Ashkenazi Jews, allegedly 12-15 points above other Europeans. They favour the theory that this is genetically determined because medieval north European Jews were restricted to white-collar occupations, particularly money lending, in which only intelligent people could succeed, giving them greater reproductive success in a community where marrying out was forbidden.However, the data they present is superficial. The influence of heritability on IQ shifts during a person’s life, rising dramatically as children grow to adulthood. But the authors never give the ages of the people in their statistics, making them impossible to assess.Their claim that 80% of economically active medieval Ashkenazim were full-time moneylenders is unconvincing, since Jews were confined to ghettoes with separate micro-economies, and rules forbidding the ‘improper subordination’ of Christians by Jews would probably have created the need for a Jewish servant class.Despite these caveats, this hypothesis is credible if unproven. There is no a priori reason why the heritable intelligence of every ethnic group should be the same and the Ashkenazim are a genetically closed community with a unique history.CONCLUSIONSThe 10,000 Year Explosion makes noteworthy points about physiological differences between the races and asks an interesting question about the intelligence of Ashkenazi Jews without quite supplying the answer. But it has conspicuously failed to demonstrate any other link between race and either intelligence or character. Cochran and Harpending’s Neanderthal hypothesis is highly speculative, and their claims about bourgeois values and agriculture rest on questionable evidence and a willingness to ignore simpler and more obvious explanations.Please see my website for a longer and fully sourced version of this review."
127,0465002218,http://goodreads.com/user/show/84499280-david-baer,4,"I got worried reading the introduction, because (among many others) they thanked Phil Rushton, who I remember from a lifetime ago as being in the news in a bad way, as in using his research to either promote or implicitly support racist ideologies. But I continued anyway, because I find the subject matter fascinating.Because, as I opined in my review of Before the Dawn: Recovering the Lost History of Our Ancestors, it's not by definition racist to inquire into the genetic basis of racial variation - it's only racist if you use such inquiry to justify privilege for one group, or even to consider one group as inherently superior to another. So, for example, it's not racist to find the genetic basis for why Kenyans are so successful at long-distance running. It is racist to conclude from that fact, that, I don't know, say, ""driving while black"" isn't really a thing. Or that separation of the ""races"" is a good thing, etc etc.This book isn't racist, in my opinion - but I understand how it could come off as such. The thing about Ashkenazi Jews having enhanced intelligence has a certain taint to it, because it's been used to justify (racist) hierarchies of the ""races"". And this thing about the Ashkenazi Jews comes up again and again: because they experienced unique conditions of repression in northern Europe for a thousand years, those who could really be successful in intellectually challenging roles such as (principally) money-lending, were more reproductively successful. So there is a lot of evidence presented, and I buy it, and I don't believe I am racist for buying it, but still - there are a lot of racists who also buy it, and that makes me a bit uncomfortable.Even though the book has a lot of footnotes and a good bibliography, I felt the authors did a poor job of constructing arguments. It seemed they were all over the place, all the time - promising answers and then discursively wandering away from what they promised to answer, never getting back to it. Like on page 91 we are told ""we now understand quite a bit about the genetic changes that led to light skin in northern Eurasians."" Wow! That's a big statement; I was prepared for a big explanation. But a dozen pages of stuff later, they were moving on to another topic; I carefully re-read the intervening pages, which were all quite interesting, but I confirmed that they definitely never delivered on their promised explanation of skin color.I give it 4 stars because I love the subject matter and am fascinated by the implications of the fact that all modern people emerged from a small African population of humans who lived about 50kya. Our written history is so microscopic compared to all of what must have happened - just to know what we can infer from genetics to fill in the blanks is amazing. Unfortunately racists will also find much to love in this book; I can't help that and it's not the fault of the authors either."
128,0465002218,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50953703-groot,5,"The rate of human evolution has accelerated radically over the last 10,000 years. This takes a genetic perspective on history and archaeology, benefiting from the vast improvement in the science and technology of genomic knowledge. Organisms, including people, adapt to changing environments, and our environment is changing radically, starting with the Upper Paleolithic, the introduction of farming, settling into towns, domesticating animals (including milk-yielding species), the vast increase in the number of humans and consequent breeding ground for infectious diseases, literacy and numeracy and their contribution to human prospering for those that could excel at them, and so on. A fascinating book, with some safe and interesting insights, but not shying away from more controversial hypotheses, such as the contributions of proto-humans, such as Neanderthals and Denisovans, to modern humans, with their longer-term adaptations to living in northern climes, possibly contributing lighter skin and other features."
129,0465002218,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40298632-joe-q,4,"This book cogently argues that, rather than ending with the dawn of modern Homo sapiens, evolution has been continuing apace over the last 10,000 years. Arguments from natural selection are used to explain patterns in world history, including Europeans' success in displacing Amerindians in the Americas and their failure to displace Africans in the tropical parts of that continent. It's a quick read, and very enlightening.While the authors make their case very clearly, I would have liked to see them explore whether modern medical science -- or demographics in general -- has weakened the link between ""reproductive fitness"" and actual numbers of descendants. Given that so much infectious disease can be treated or controlled, quality food and good sanitation are abundant, and many very ""reproductively fit"" people choose to have small families (or none at all), does their thesis still apply? Will the next 10,000 years be like the last 10,000 were?"
130,0465002218,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70611546-kevin,2,"According to this book, conventional evolutionary psychology claims that we became adapted to the savannah after spending hundreds of thousands of years other. The tens of thousands of years since we left Africa were not enough for evolution to do anything more than tweak us around the edges and the time since the agricultural revolution is a mere blink of an evolutionary eye and human evolution has more or less slowed to a crawl.The 10,000 Year Explosion is evolutionary psychology dialed up to 11. Rather than slowing down, evolution has actually sped up. Genetic change was responsible not just for the agricultural revolution but the scientific and industrial revolutions too, not to mention the rise and fall of empires. Examples of candidate mutations abound. The sum of the books arguments, though was unconvincing. "

The authors lays out evolutionary thinking in such a way that the reader will by the end of the book feel a lot more confident in her understanding of the world. It should truly be read by everyone.The book can be read by anyone without any prior knowledge on evolutionary theory. The minimum level of the book is high-school.

The concept of a variant on 'artificial selection' as is observed for dogs and other domesticated animals and plants, seems suggested although not explicit. This seems based on advantages for particular populations, with more offspring among those with particular genetic traits and cultural adaptations such as herding, farming, urbanization, domestic animals such as horses, and improved military weaponry. Pretty persuasive that the process seems ongoing."

Then I brought the book with me on my trips to Chengdu with parents and reading became on and off and hard to concentrate. So the middle part of the book is a bit lost to me. Then I returned home and read the last chapter about why a branch of Jews (German Jews) are super smart while bearing more genetic diseases really really interesting and I learned a lot.

146,0465002218,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12991284-jeremy,3,"As a long time reader of science books I was immediately attracted to this book due to its great title – titles are important, take note publishers. The last science book I read was the great The Fifth Miracle by Paul Davies, which was an examination of how life evolved. Cochran and Harpending’s book promised an argument against the long held theory that humans stopped evolving fifty thousand years ago, just after emerging out of Africa. The book describes itself as the “…the latest edition to the fast emerging discipline of biohistory.” There’s been quite a bit of news related to this area lately, so I thought that it was time to give it a read.The book opens with a refutation of “conventional wisdom”, with the authors claiming that human evolution has accelerated in the last ten thousand years due to various selection pressures, such as agriculture, geographic expansion and climate change. They go on to examine the period that started fifty to forty thousand years ago when modern humans moved into the European territories of the Neanderthal. Ten thousand years later the Neanderthal were extinct and humans were flourishing. No one knows for sure but it seems that humans displayed better adaptations such as advanced language, tools and hunting techniques. There is convincing genetic evidence that we interbreed with Neanderthals and picked up and kept various advantageous genes – just ask Ozzy Osbourne. The ensuing four chapters examine the impact of the advent of agriculture some ten thousand years ago and how the changes to what we ate affected our genetic makeup; the genetic flow of humanity as expressed by selective sweeps of particular genes and also the impact of expansion on humans throughout the globe. A succinct summary - but if you want to know the facts then read the book! But is it worth reading?The ideas presented in The 10,000 Year Explosion are certainly well argued. The authors blend history, archaeology, paleontology and biology to weave their arguments convincingly. They refer to their work as “genetic history” – a “new kind of history.” This is all very well but unfortunately the flaw of this book is that the writing style is relatively bland. There is an effort to engage and give the facts some personality, but as interested as I was in the arguments presented I often found myself bored. I believe that writing popular science is a tricky thing, because, after all, you don’t want to dumb it down; but also you don’t want to put the average reader off either. After reading this book I appreciate science writers such as Paul Davies and Marcus Chown for their efforts to both explain and engage.The 10,000 Year Explosion ends with a case study of the Ashkenazi Jews – Jews that were confined to Europe from medieval times and that were restricted to money lending and clerical professions; the kind of jobs that required a certain level of intelligence. The combination of the demands of their profession and their tendency to marry within their faith meant that the European Jews were selected for a higher intelligence than Jews in the Middle East. Five hundred or so years later descendants of this group were making the major scientific breakthroughs throughout many disciplines and they also displayed higher IQs than other groups. A fascinating case study, but once again the bland writing created a nagging sense of boredom.The story of human evolution is an amazing tale to behold - one that’s obsessed me on and off for years. It’s compelling, fascinating and most of all it’s our story. Unfortunately this book does not really capture the sense of wonder that our story can engender, which is a shame. Read this book if you want the facts, but perhaps look elsewhere if you want to feel that elusive sense of wonder. Although I was slightly disappointed overall, the one interesting thing this book did do for me was to make me ponder just how our present point in human evolutionary history will be viewed in five hundred years; and that’s not such a bad thing."
147,0465002218,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17431775-schwarzenberger,3,"Considering the subject matter, it is a light read with a lot of little tidbits thrown in about how many relatives Genghis Khan has that are still living across central Asia, how disease really helped Pizarro and only 168 soldiers tear apart the Inca Empire, where blue eyes originated, and other such scientific matters that make great dinner conversation and cocktail party opening lines.By the way, i like the cover with the almost stroboscopic depiction of evolutionary influenced skeletal uprightness and locomotion. It is a grabber of a design that gets your eye from across the floor of the library or bookshop.The authors may not like this, but I am giving away a highly kept secret they mention in the index--Yes I actually do read indices, to me they give a sense of the real core of a book and let you know what the authors think is really important. If you have limited time perusing the index gets you right to the action. Well, in the index there is an entry--Lost Dutchman Mine, location, 400. I guess this means that one or both of the authors knows where this reputedly amazingly rich gold mine is hidden. It is a legend in its own right, I'm sure there are some good books about it and Wikipedia says people are still looking for it. The authors know where it is and they are telling you. It is all on page 400! However, my paperback edition (2010) only has 288 pages including the index. It's a wonderfully hidden joke that I did not see mentioned in any other review. I guess we'll have to wait another 10,000 years for the ""20,000 Year Explosion"" followup edition that will explain how humans have evolved since the demise of print books, audio CDs, broadcast television, sidewalks and other signs of civilization. Hopefully this newer edition will have a page 400.To me this was a fascinating read. ""Explosion"" discusses human genetics and evolution, a subject that I have found interesting for a long time but have not actually had the patience to really delve into in order to get a comprehensive basis for true knowledge--I feel that it would take a little more time than I want to dedicate to find out more about organic chemistry and processes of how organic molecules act and react with other to make up DNA mechanisms, and how that affects how life works etc. I did tackle ""The Eight Day of Creation"" some decades ago...what I read of it was fascinating but then life's personal activities got in the way. But the thing that really stopped me was that I kept the used copy (It cost only 1 dollar) of the book I bought on a back shelf for about 10 years and then when I finally started reading it and got a little more than half way through--it is an 800 page monster--I realized that it was mis-bound and many pages were duplicated but also very mixed up and completely out of order. More importantly, a lot was missing overall and the local library didn't have a copy that that could be loaned out to read. I was not going to sit in the library and work my way through it. So basically, that's now where I left my knowledge of genes and DNA and alleles and the mechanics of genetics.That said, I did appreciate the simplification in general that the authors made to get their point across. That point is that we are still evolving, our physiology is still reacting to the environment around us trying to adapt us in the best way possible to allow for species survival and thriving. It's a good read and will get me to read more about this subject. Parts of their theses reminded me of Julian Jaynes' book with that wonderful title--""The Development of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind"" and his theory that we humans finally realized that it wasn't the Gods talking to each and every one of us, it was just our brains finally melding messages together across the corpus callosum inside each of our skulls."
148,0465002218,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1219617-erik,3,"Cochran and Harpending dispel the long-held scientific notion that human evolution reached a plateau tens of thousands of years ago, as well as all change has been cultural. Instead, they argue that cultural change has effected genetic change, and vice versa. Not only did agriculture select for certain characteristics – like lactose tolerance as a result of animal husbandry, for one – but so introgression with Neanderthals, which has been historically frowned upon in the scientific community due to biased in favor of the notion homo sapiens purity. ""The explosion is ongoing: Human evolution didn’t stop when anatomically modern humans appeared, or when they expanded out of Africa. It never stopped – and why would it? Evolutionary stasis requires a static environment, whereas behavioral modernity is all about innovation and change. Stability is exactly what we have not had. This should be obvious, but instead the human sciences have labored under the strange idea that evolution stopped 40,000 years ago.""One of their most controversial notions is their well-supported argument that the Ashkenazi Jews of Eastern Europe have a genetic propensity for higher intelligence as a direct result of marriage only within their community combined with societal pressures against intermarriage with gentiles, strict limitations on what kinds of white-collars jobs they could hold (banking, finance, science), and the resulting economic rewards for succeeding economically (higher birth rate, better heated homes, more personal privacy in those homes that helped thwart contact with diseases fatal to the more impoverished, etc.). All of these combined set the conditions for natural selection that resulted in a better-educated and genetically-insular population with a slightly higher-than-average IQ when compared to the other European genetic groups that they lived alongside. Perhaps this is a stretch for the politically correct crowd, but it certainly is worthy of reasoned debate and consideration. (On the flip side, Cochran and Harpending are quick to remind us that the Ashkenazi Jews also have an accompanying genetic predisposition for various diseases that other groups do not have.)As an educator, I was particularly struck by their assertion that ""Nongenetic factors also influence IQ, but for the most part, the ones that matter are not the ones people thought would matter. Prenatal care, breastfeeding, nutrition, access to early education, Mozart in the womb, and oat bran all have little or no effect. Surprisingly, the way in which a family raised children seems to have no effect on adult IQ.""Alas, neither Cochran nor Harpending go on to detail just what nongenetic factors can or do influence IQ. (I would argue that the quality of formal education be one.)On a style note, I admit to wishing several times for either Richard Dawkins or Jared Diamond’s more persuasive and personable narrative styles. (No surprise, Diamond’s Guns, Germs, and Steel and The Third Chimpanzee are both quoted numerous times.) Of course, knowing that this is the first book between the Cochran and Harpending, I imagine that they will both improve in this area in future books the co-write. "
149,0465002218,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4975079-daniel-hammer,4,"This is just the kind of exciting, accessible and provocative science that I like to read about. For the most part. Cochran and Harpending's book presents the argument that human evolution has increased in pace over the last 10,000 years. This is in contrast to a more standard view which argues that, due to the ability to culturally and technologically reshape our environment, modern human beings have less of a need to evolve biologically in response to environmental pressures. He begins with a few basics of populations genetic which support the likelihood of an increased rate of evolution in recent times. Among these are the increase in human population numbers; more people equals more chances for mutations to develop. Also important is the fact that our diets have changed more in the past 10,000 years than had hominin diets for the previous several million years. This would have introduced significant dietary pressures on us, and those who could tolerate or process certain foods (such as lactose) would be more evolutionarily successful. 10,000 years ago is a key starting point because it corresponds with the advent of agriculture, which introduced larger populations, new diets, crowded living, and more.Cochran and Harpending survey a range or very interesting ideas. They argue that humans almost definitely bred with Neanderthals. That lactose tolerance was a key to the spread of Indo-European languages, via the adaptable, milk-drinking people which spoke those tongues. They examine a number of genetic mutations which are limited to certain populations and reflect recent genetic (evolutionary) responses to environment and diet, like sickle-cell trait. They suggest that light skin color may have evolved for more than just the ability to synthesize more vitamin D, and that the human brain likely underwent important structural changes just in the past 30,000 years.All of this is seriously interesting, and a pleasure to read and debate. The downside is that Cochran and Harpending are slim on evidence for much of this. I an inclined to believe they are largely correct, but too often the book reads like a laundry list of exciting suggestions, without much to back them up.This book certainly worth a quick read and makes some great food for thought."
150,0465002218,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19773041-joseph-hirsch,3,"Depending on a whole host of factors (your scientific background, religion, personal experiences, and biases, to name a few) one could come away from ""The 10,000 Year Explosion"" thinking that anthropologist Greg Cochran is an intellectually voracious man who wants to know where and how humans differ in their genes in order to cure diseases and increase social harmony, or conversely, that he is a latter-day Cesare Lombroso who wants to bust out the calipers to measure our heads to find out which of us have seed worth saving for his eugenic experiments and which of us need to undergo forced sterilization.Having read his ""10,000 Year Explosion"" written by Cochran in conjunction with geneticist Henry Harpending, I found the authors to be intelligent, humorous men capable of explaining very, very complicated concepts in a way that did not scare off this layman. The problem I had with the book was not some kind of moral objection (science doesn't care about my feelings) but rather the nagging sense that this was a paper or presentation stretched out to book length, and that any one of the ideas explicated in the book in one chapter would have made a great book in itself. Dr (?) Cochran cites Jared Diamond's ""Guns, Germs, and Steel"" multiple times throughout the book; I just wish he'd taken the same sort of ""deep dive"" approach to this book in terms of its structure and breadth. In brief (and it's hard to be brief with this information) Cochran argues that human evolution did not stop roughly 40,000 years ago as many believe, and that evolution is an ongoing process, and that this process can ""explode"" in a very local and idiosyncratic way, based on everything from rigorous man-made laws (especially regarding things like out-marriage) to civic arrangements (one of the more disturbing but fascinating detours in the book holds that once humans shifted from hunter-gatherers to agrarians, we started to favor the conforming and even servile over the independent and strong).Someone, in an attempt to summarize this book, called it something like an exploration of history through the lens of genetics, which would be a pretty good capitulation. The authors take the reader from ancient Asian Steppes where Mongol hordes perfected a simple but effective reproduction strategy (kill the men and mate with the women), all the way forward in time to an Israeli hospital in the twenty-first, where the idea that genetic advantages can become disadvantages or can even be made irrelevant is explored. As previously mentioned, all of the subjects dealt with are fascinating, and presented in a clear manner. But it's a bit too thumbnail for my taste. Your take might differ. I'd certainly take a class with Dr. Cochran, though, if I were still in college. I imagine it would be easy to stay awake during his seminars. "
151,0465002218,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32156837-mike,5,"This is a fascinating book on the mutual influence of genes on culture and of culture on genes. The ""explosion"" referred to in the title was the advent of agriculture, which greatly multiplied the size of the human population, greatly altered culture, and redirected human evolution down new paths to adapt to this new culture. When human population increased the rate of genetic mutations increased correspondingly, which increased the rate of evolution (by 100 fold according to the authors). Humans, especially those in densely populated areas, have been evolving rapidly in the last 10,000 years--and their evolution is driven by their environment, including their culture. But, then, newly evolved humans, being different from their ancestors, develop different cultural environments more suitable to their nature. Thus, evolution and human culture form a feedback loop. Of course, in a world of relatively isolated regional and local populations, their will be different natural/cultural environments, hence differential evolution to adapt to them. Inuit amidst ice flows and tundra would not (and did not) evolve the same way as Melanesians on their tropical islands. And evolution may proceed quite rapidly under certain circumstances, particularly large population size and major environmental impetus. On top of well supported scientific theory, the authors add numerous examples of evolution-culture interaction throughout history. It's an important new perspective on history. The style of writing is clear, needless academic jargon wisely jettisoned. The historical examples that run through the book seem somewhat arbitrarily chosen, but, this being a relatively new field of inquiry, the authors are probably just following the trail of such evidence as we currently have. The newness also means we face some uncertainties of interpretation. The authors note evidential limitations when present, but are bold to cast forth their nets in some clever speculations, one of which has been confirmed since publication (non-African humans have some Neanderthal DNA). This is what scientists do and are meant to do when faced with uncertainty: formulate hypotheses, preferably intelligent, informed ones. In this book, we have something of a hybrid beast: a populist approach with some vanguard hypothesizing. "
152,0465002218,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5466619-naftoli,5,"This book has opened my eyes to so many issues; to say that it is transformative is understatement. I had been taught in college that human evolution stopped with the advent of culture, that culture made adjustments to the environment thus eliminating the need for biology to fine tune our bodies. I had also been trained to view IQ tests as simply racist tools used by white patriarchal society to convince the priveleged that minority people are inferior - it sounds hyperbolic but I was actually told this by professors! I had also been taught that all humans are essentially the same (one world, one people, that race is only skin deep). When confronted with differences in intelligence, adaptability, etc. I was taught that this is due to political inequities, war, in short, culture. This book challenges these biases. I will no doubt read this book again at some later date and refer to it from time to time. I am not trained as a scientist so I will have to review and re-review the data from time to time. I was trained as a social scientist - cultural anthropology - so I am the target audience for this book. The issue regarding Neanderthals and what became of them is one of the first issues undertaken in this work; I found it to be both realistic and reasonable. The authors rely on population genetics, mathematics, extrapolations, &c in an effort to buttress their position that modern humans have inherited a small but important percentage of Neanderthal genetic material. It makes sense to me.Among so many things, I admire the authors for having the courage to challenge our current received wisdom. It seems to me that they have taken quite a risk in doing so as there is nothing 'politically correct' about this book. The authors even point to data that most writers shy away from as it may cast them in a negative light. Whatever the reason for shying away from data, it is vital that we humans look facts straight in the face and deal with the realities of our evolution, our cultural wisdom and ethnocentricities, and our impact upon this planet. At the minimum, debate these issues rather than labeling and dismissing them. This book tackles a few of these issues."
153,0465002218,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4534780-alina,5,"The old thinking is that, when cultural evolution took off, biological evolution stopped -- because instead of being shaped by our environment, we began shaping our environment to us. That idea always seemed reasonable to me, but this book has changed my mind. The authors contend that, on the contrary, evolution has sped up since the neolithic revolution. The social innovations associated with agriculture and civilization mean we have subjected ourselves to major new environmental pressures, and that has fueled rapid natural selection. Their idea is that cultural evolution interacts with biological evolution; the two drive each other. One of the book's points is that natural selection isn't as slow as is often believed, since altering just one gene or even one nucleotide can sometimes result in important advantages. By examining evidence from the exploding field of population genetics, as well as other sources, the authors find indications of significant biological change in the past 10,000 years or so. Examples include differing disease resistance in response to local conditions, the development of lactose tolerance in dairy farmers, and selection for higher intelligence among Ashkenazi Jews. Although I'd heard of some of these things before, I hadn't appreciated the impact on history. The authors make a convincing case that genetic factors can be decisive. I no longer think of biological evolution as something that stopped being important once modern humans came into existence."
154,0465002218,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13459886-yhc,4,"We think biological evolution is fasten up the evolution of civilization, this book actually told us another side of story. Agriculture really played a very big role to form the whole new civilization, people settled down, with more food to grow more population, so were the diseases followed ( Animal husbandry kept them moving around, the diseases could not followed with the climate difference that easily). People gather up would also start to form commerce, society and strict hierarchy and government.below i copied the part i found interesting : Ashkenazi jewish. 那么为何德系犹太人特别聪慧呢？想要解答这个谜题，或许我们可以看看关于阿什肯纳兹犹太人的DNA我们都知道些什么，因为事实证明它们还有另一个有趣的特征。即，它们有一组不常见的严重遗传病，例如家族性黑蒙性痴呆症、高雪氏病、家族性自主神经功能异常，以及两种不同形式的遗传性乳腺癌（BRCA1和BRCA2），这些疾病在阿什肯纳兹犹太人群体中的发病率比在其他欧洲人群中高将近100倍。我们相信这两个谜题有单一的解释。我们认为阿什肯纳兹犹太人在北欧逗留的时期在白领职业的自然选择中获得了成功，而这成功源自他们智力上的遗传优势。但对于智力的强势选择也产生了一些让人不愉快的副作用：提高遗传携带者智商的等位基因同时也对纯合体产生损害。这一类解释自然是有争议的。事实上很多人排斥这一类说法：智力是可测量的，由遗传决定的，不同的人类群体间有智力上的差异。有趣的是，这些批评和斥责甚少来自从事认知测试及其结果分析的科学工作者。业内对此很少或几乎没有任何争议，智商测试是准确的，测试结果能预测学术成就和个体生活的其他方面，而且智商值有极高的遗传率。如果遗传的确能影响智力，那么一段时间后，智力带来的繁殖优势必然会带来更高的智力。这个简单的逻辑是关于自然选择的演化理论的核心：能增加繁殖的基因在人类群体中会随时间推移变得越来越常见。.................我们认为印欧扩张起始于乳糖耐受突变的频率增高，当其频率增高至足以使整个人群转型从事制乳业经济的时候，印欧人就迅速扩散至整个南俄大草原。这迅速的扩张就有可能导致说近似语言的同一人群分散在从当今的乌克兰直到乌拉尔河地区这一广阔区域。因为扩张如此迅速，语言还没有分化，所以这一广大区域中分散的人群说的还是相似的语言。印欧人前进的步伐持续至进入欧洲，在那里制乳业在生态学效应上足以跟早期农业竞争，而且前者催生了一种远远更具侵略性的文化。印欧文化很可能是更好战的，因为印欧人群的高机动性、更多的人口数量和更好的营养使他们能比其他人群更经常赢得战争。而他们的胜利反过来又会提升他们的军事行动效率，从而成功哺育了更多成功。从印欧人基因在欧洲基因库占的相对低的比例来看，他们似乎实行的是精英统治，做被征服人群的统治者但没有摧毁或替代原先的居住者。然而相对小的精英人口常常能够让所有其余人口说他们的语言。此外，印欧人还把乳糖耐受的等位基因加进了本地的混合基因库。乳糖耐受突变在印欧人入侵前的欧洲很罕见或根本不存在，然而当制乳业受自然选择青睐的时候，它就在欧洲变得很常见了，特别是在北欧。[20]印欧语言和文化在制乳业流行的地域传播扩散，比方说，它们还进入了南欧和伊朗，然而中东的强势国家们似乎阻止了这些语言文化进入中东。我们认为印欧扩张起始于乳糖耐受突变的频率增高，当其频率增高至足以使整个人群转型从事制乳业经济的时候，印欧人就迅速扩散至整个南俄大草原。这迅速的扩张就有可能导致说近似语言的同一人群分散在从当今的乌克兰直到乌拉尔河地区这一广阔区域。因为扩张如此迅速，语言还没有分化，所以这一广大区域中分散的人群说的还是相似的语言。印欧人前进的步伐持续至进入欧洲，在那里制乳业在生态学效应上足以跟早期农业竞争，而且前者催生了一种远远更具侵略性的文化。印欧文化很可能是更好战的，因为印欧人群的高机动性、更多的人口数量和更好的营养使他们能比其他人群更经常赢得战争。而他们的胜利反过来又会提升他们的军事行动效率，从而成功哺育了更多成功。从印欧人基因在欧洲基因库占的相对低的比例来看，他们似乎实行的是精英统治，做被征服人群的统治者但没有摧毁或替代原先的居住者。然而相对小的精英人口常常能够让所有其余人口说他们的语言。此外，印欧人还把乳糖耐受的等位基因加进了本地的混合基因库。乳糖耐受突变在印欧人入侵前的欧洲很罕见或根本不存在，然而当制乳业受自然选择青睐的时候，它就在欧洲变得很常见了，特别是在北欧。[20]印欧语言和文化在制乳业流行的地域传播扩散，比方说，它们还进入了南欧和伊朗，然而中东的强势国家们似乎阻止了这些语言文化进入中东。.......一开始他们是作为基督教与穆斯林世界的中介的国际商人。然而随着穆斯林和基督徒（特别是意大利人）逐渐开始直接通商，阿什肯纳兹犹太商人越来越多地开始从事本地贸易。当对犹太人的迫害越来越严重从而长距离旅行无法得到安全保障之后，德系犹太人越来越专注于金融业，这个行业对他们是敞开的，因为基督徒被禁止放高利贷。在公元1100年前绝大部分德系犹太人都是放贷者，这一模式延续了几个世纪。[15]这些职业（交易和金融业）有很高的智商需求，我们可以肯定没有其他人类群体有这么高数量比例的人口在长时段内从事需要很高认知能力的职业。有时我们能找到相当详尽的阿什肯纳兹犹太人的商业活动记录。比如关于南法鲁西永犹太人在约公元1270年就有这样的记录：“有全面证据证明这群犹太人以放贷为生，实质上完全没有从事任何其他种类的经济活动。有记录的228名男性犹太人中近八成在向他们的基督教邻居放贷。犹太女人（几乎都是寡妇）放贷的也很常见，这些来自弱势者的资本被投资到相似的渠道。并且最积极从事放贷的犹太人似乎在他们的群体内是最受尊崇的。................他们曾是波兰立陶宛王国的管理者阶层。除了读写能力之外，在这些特定职业上取得成功所依靠的是类似于现今商人的素质，至少也需要有追踪复杂交易和资金流动的能力。最终，随着波兰立陶宛王国的阿什肯纳兹犹太人人口数量上升，越来越多的犹太人成了手工艺者——毕竟对管理和金融职业的需求也是有一定限度的。然而在800到900年的时间段内，也就是大致从公元800年到公元1650或1700年，绝大部分的阿什肯纳兹犹太人从事的是管理和金融业，也就是复杂度很高的职业，他们几乎从来不当农民和匠人。在这个方面他们和所有其他定居人口都有所不同。事实上，在那个时代任何占有领地的人类族群都不可能有那么高比例的人口从事白领职业，因为这样农业生产率就会过低。九成的人口都必须务农，从而生产足够的粮食去养活他们自己和社会顶层少量的统治者、文员、士兵、匠人以及商人。对白领职业的自然选择只有在这一阶层独自成为一个族群的时候才有可能成功，这一族群必须靠职业而非其据地而界定。在高复杂度职业中取得成功的犹太人享有更高的遗传优势。学者怀里波说：“在富裕的家庭中有更多的孩子能活到成年。总体上属于更富裕阶层的许多商业领袖、显赫拉比、群体领袖和类似个体的谱系显示，这些人通常有4个、6个甚至8～9个孩子活到成年。........智商有很高的可遗传性。这意味着一个个体的智商值会部分取决于遗传影响，从而更接近他或她的父母和兄弟姐妹而不是随便哪个别人。同一对父母生下的子女即便在不同环境下养大也会有相近的智商值，而领养的兄弟姐妹即便在同一屋檐下长大也不会有相近的智商值。高度也是类似的：长得高的人更可能有高于平均身高的子女。事实上，成年人的智商值与身高一样主要受遗传因素影响。然而童年的智商值却受遗传影响更少，而更容易受周围环境影响。周围环境对儿童智商测试结果的影响会在青春期期间或其后消失，这成了美国先锋计划（Head Start Program）的基础，即宣扬智商值能因一定干预而提高。非遗传因素同样会影响智商值，但很多情况下那些起作用的因素都不是人们想象会起作用的因素。父母关爱、母乳喂养、营养情况、早教、子宫中听莫扎特音乐和燕麦麸几乎都没起什么作用。而让人惊讶的是，一个家庭养育孩子的方式看起来对孩子成年时的智商值没有任何影响。这有效地反驳了一些流行的环境决定论——它们对阿什肯纳兹犹太人的高智商做各种成长环境方面的解释，尤其反驳了那些认为犹太母亲用特殊的方式抚养孩子催发了他们的高智商的论调。...在阿什肯纳兹犹太人特别高发的遗传病中，广为人知的是家族性黑蒙性痴呆症、高雪氏病和BRCA1与BRCA2乳腺癌突变，但同时还有许多其他的疾病，比如尼曼匹克症、卡纳万病和家族性自主神经功能异常。有些会引起神经方面的问题。它们在阿什肯纳兹犹太人身上特别高发，这已经成了人类遗传学上一个长久的谜题。.....是什么样的性征在阿什肯纳兹犹太人身上比在他们的邻居身上更宝贵呢？嗯，我们有一些很强的线索。是什么性征在当今的德系犹太人身上最突出呢？他们是壮大如萨摩亚人，高如图西族人，以及牛奶耐受如荷兰人吗？不是的，他们的特殊性征就是智力。这些突变体本身就提示了这一点：它们中的一些看起来就很像会提高智商的，考虑到它们作用于中枢神经系统的发展。鞘脂类突变体特别有可能具有提升智力的作用。在每一种这类突变体中，都有一些特定鞘脂累积；这些鞘脂是变更过的脂类分子，它们在信号传输中起作用，并在神经组织中特别常见。研究者已经确定这些鞘脂类作用水平的提升会引致神经元（中枢神经系统的基本细胞）之间更多的连接（高雪氏病的轴突生长）。在家族性黑蒙性痴呆症的情形中有相似的效应：特定的累积混合物（GM2神经节苷脂）作用水平提升会促进树突（连接神经元的纤细多分支突起）的增长。[41]这种树突生成的增加现象也同样发生在A型尼曼匹克细胞出现、动物版黑蒙性痴呆症和尼曼匹克病的情形下。这些都是已知的疾病等位基因中唯一能引致神经连接增加的因素。我们同时还有（并不确凿的）证据证明德系犹太人身上常见的一些基因变异有可能提升智力。我们研究了耶路撒冷高雪氏病患者的职业——实际上是所有在耶路撒冷沙尔泽德克医学中心（Shaare Zedek Medical Centre）治疗的患者。这些患者成为工程师或科学家的概率比以色列阿什肯纳兹犹太人从事这些职业的平均概率要高很多，事实上大概要高11倍。[42]关于阿什肯纳兹犹太人的另一种遗传病扭转性肌张力障碍也有类似的研究结果。这种遗传病最初被诊断出来的时候，研究者就已经开始注意到其患者不同寻常的智力水平。.....结论文化革新在很长的时间里都是人类生物学变化的驱动力，在约250万年前人类开始使用工具之后就一直如此。自然选择青睐那些从事早期文化革新的原始人类大脑，而这些革新本身就导向更多身体和心理上的变化。生物学特征和文化特征的协同演化一开始是很缓慢的，至少以现代标准看是慢的，但渐渐演化速度就快起来了。考古学记录显示我们的革新能力持续上升，直至约4万年前，我们已经为所谓的“人类革命”或旧石器时代晚期欧洲和亚洲北部的“创造性大爆发”蓄势待发。技术和艺术的突然兴盛发生在人类扩张并走出非洲的不久以后；它同时也跟生物学变化有关，而我们猜想这些生物学变化部分是由从尼安德特人或其他远古人类（亚洲大陆更早的占据者）身上偷得的基因驱动的。行为现代化导致更多的变化：人类制作更精良的工具，然后他们在数代人的时间里也反过来被这些工具不断塑造变化。农业出现之后，文化和生物演化都加速了，因为新的生活方式使人们有了新的需求。农业出现以前人类一直都是觅食者：农业带来的人口急剧增加使得更多有益的变异体出现，也使得更多新想法出现。我们人类在农业传播后的快速演化的确是一万年的爆发。 这爆发如今还在持续：人类演化并没有止步于解剖学意义上的现代人类出现，或他们扩张走出非洲的时候。它从来没有停止。而且它怎么会停下呢？演化停滞需要一个静滞的环境，而行为现代化一直带来的都是革新和变化。一直以来我们都不曾有稳定和静滞的环境。这一点应该是很明显的，然而人类科学不仅忽视了它，相反还一直在一个奇怪的前提下辛勤地做研究，这个奇怪的想法认为演化在4万年前就停止了。 所有这些都意味着也必然意味着，生物变化是驱动历史的重要因素。当然它不是唯一的因素，而且很奇怪的是，它还被与更传统的影响绑定在一起。诸如乳糖耐受一类的遗传变化的出现和传播是文化革新（例如农业的发展）的结果，它同时也源自随机出现的合适的突变。这些遗传变化反过来也对文化产生了影响。印欧人的扩张，欧洲人在北美和澳大利亚的成功定居，“瓜分非洲”的失败，阿什肯纳兹犹太人进入智力舞台，甚至有可能工业革命和科学的兴起，所有这些看来都是生物和文化变化之永恒的舞步所营造的。 如果人类科学的研究者们继续忽略自然选择从未停止作用这一事实，他们就会把许多重要问题的解答线索给丢掉，把谜题变成秘密。科尔特斯带着500人就征服并控制了几百万人的帝国。想要解释这件事情而不提持续演化带来的疾病抵御机制中的生物学差异，这完全不可能。公元前5世纪的修昔底德说人类特征是不会变化的，所以可以预测，而当今许多科学家相信人类特征几万年前就停止了改变。历史学家们似乎一直以此为研究的前提。然而这样一来他们就忽略了巨大的契机，不仅在于解读人类的往昔，而且也在于塑造未来。贯穿人类历史的持续演化一直是一个巨大的自然界的实验，这个实验承诺了我们在理解自身、抵御疾病和精神病症方面的巨大的成果。利莫内苏尔加尔达隐藏着关于人类疾病的一个重要线索。世界上大概有100万个这样的小村庄，一定有更多类似的线索等待我们去发现。人类历史为我们展现的一些实验的成果甚至有可能帮助我们进行更有野心的尝试，去增加人类寿命和认知能力。从事人类科学的学者们是时候去甩掉一系列关于演化停止和“心理均一”的僵化教条了。每一刻时间都很宝贵，我们有一整个世界要去争取呢。"

I will give it 4/5 on account of me enjoying the ideas. These ideas, however, convince me to the extent of them ""making sense"". As a scientist I do expect much more in order to be convinced. I understand that this would make the book significantly longer and it might not necessarily be aimed for the ""general public"", but I would argue that here we don't really see the case of oversimplification being the issue, since the ideas, terminology, methodology described etc. are not necessarily ""dumbed down"". Instead, there is a certain haughty attitude - judging by this book alone, everybody other than the authors thinks genetic changes in human beings stopped 40,000 years ago and is wholly dogmatic. "
156,0465002218,http://goodreads.com/user/show/77887124-paul-clark,1,"This book rejects the view that race is primarily a social construct and proposes five hypotheses about genetic differences between ethnic groups. The first two, lactose tolerance and resistance to pathogens, are physiological and uncontroversial. The same cannot be said of the other three: that interbreeding between Eurasians and Neanderthals increased Eurasian intelligence, that long-term exposure to agriculture leads to a greater predisposition to the ‘bourgeois’ values of hard work and restraint, and that medieval restrictions on Ashkenazi Jews raised their intelligence. This review will focus on these three hypotheses.THE NEANDERTHAL ADVANTAGEHomo sapiens first encountered Neanderthals after leaving Africa 40,000 years ago. Cochran and Harpending speculate that interbreeding between the two species raised Eurasian intelligence, triggering the Upper Palaeolithic revolution in technology, symbolic behaviour and socio-economic organisation. Quite how sub-Saharan Africans later managed the same transition to modern behaviour without the benefit of Neanderthal DNA, the authors do not say.In any case, many archaeologists favour non-genetic explanations for the transition. Others argue that it occurred in Africa much earlier, citing discoveries like a large 70,000 year-old settlement in Sudan and sophisticated 44,000 year-old southern African artefacts. If critics of the Upper Palaeolithic model turn out to be correct, Cochran and Harpending’s highly speculative hypothesis would be falsified.THE AGRICULTURAL REVOLUTION AND BOURGEOIS VALUESThe authors claim that the development of agriculture led to the spread of genes for hard work and restraint among those populations in the Middle East, East Asia and Europe that have been exposed to agriculture for longest.Whilst superficially convincing, their account has serious flaws. The most glaring is the claim that ADHD has been bred out of China, where it actually affects up to 5% of schoolchildren. Other claims presented as facts are in reality matters of dispute. Agriculture might have arisen in sub-Saharan Africa 1,000 years earlier than the authors state, and their claim that Australian Aborigines never developed agriculture is contested.In most pre-capitalist societies, hard work did not have the significance the authors give it because any attempt to rise above your station was seen as sinful and peasants generally did as little work as they could get away with. The way people accumulated wealth was to squeeze it out of someone else as a warlord, a landlord or the holder of a sinecure that enabled them to milk others.Traders who acquired wealth through hard work dreamed of turning it into land, finding an impoverished noble family to marry into and putting their feet up. The only ones unable to do this were religious minorities like Armenians, Jews, Lebanese and Parsees. Cochran and Harpending claim that bourgeois genes made these communities successful middlemen when in fact it was their minority religion that trapped them in this niche.Similarly dubious is the claim that a lack of bourgeois genes fuels opposition to neo-liberalism in Latin America. Surely the growth of the industrial working class is a better explanation for the influence of socialism there.The authors contrast farmers who refrain from eating their seed corn with hunter gatherers who scupper efforts to turn them into herders by eating all their goats. But are hunter gatherers really so stupid? Or is this a case of a top-down innovation deliberately sabotaged by a community that never wanted it?The claim that aggression has been bred out of those populations longest exposed to agriculture is undermined by Cohen and Nisbett’s famous study that found startling differences in levels of aggression between genetically indistinguishable people from different cultures.THE INTELLIGENCE OF AHKANAZI JEWSCochran and Harpending’s third controversial hypothesis concerns the high IQs of Ashkenazi Jews, allegedly 12-15 points above other Europeans. They favour the theory that this is genetically determined because medieval north European Jews were restricted to white-collar occupations, particularly money lending, in which only intelligent people could succeed, giving them greater reproductive success in a community where marrying out was forbidden.However, the data they present is superficial. The influence of heritability on IQ shifts during a person’s life, rising dramatically as children grow to adulthood. But the authors never give the ages of the people in their statistics, making them impossible to assess.Their claim that 80% of economically active medieval Ashkenazim were full-time moneylenders is unconvincing, since Jews were confined to ghettoes with separate micro-economies, and rules forbidding the ‘improper subordination’ of Christians by Jews would probably have created the need for a Jewish servant class.Despite these caveats, this hypothesis is credible if unproven. There is no a priori reason why the heritable intelligence of every ethnic group should be the same and the Ashkenazim are a genetically closed community with a unique history.CONCLUSIONSThe 10,000 Year Explosion makes noteworthy points about physiological differences between the races and asks an interesting question about the intelligence of Ashkenazi Jews without quite supplying the answer. But it has conspicuously failed to demonstrate any other link between race and either intelligence or character. Cochran and Harpending’s Neanderthal hypothesis is highly speculative, and their claims about bourgeois values and agriculture rest on questionable evidence and a willingness to ignore simpler and more obvious explanations.Please see my website for a longer and fully sourced version of this review."
157,0465002218,http://goodreads.com/user/show/84499280-david-baer,4,"I got worried reading the introduction, because (among many others) they thanked Phil Rushton, who I remember from a lifetime ago as being in the news in a bad way, as in using his research to either promote or implicitly support racist ideologies. But I continued anyway, because I find the subject matter fascinating.Because, as I opined in my review of Before the Dawn: Recovering the Lost History of Our Ancestors, it's not by definition racist to inquire into the genetic basis of racial variation - it's only racist if you use such inquiry to justify privilege for one group, or even to consider one group as inherently superior to another. So, for example, it's not racist to find the genetic basis for why Kenyans are so successful at long-distance running. It is racist to conclude from that fact, that, I don't know, say, ""driving while black"" isn't really a thing. Or that separation of the ""races"" is a good thing, etc etc.This book isn't racist, in my opinion - but I understand how it could come off as such. The thing about Ashkenazi Jews having enhanced intelligence has a certain taint to it, because it's been used to justify (racist) hierarchies of the ""races"". And this thing about the Ashkenazi Jews comes up again and again: because they experienced unique conditions of repression in northern Europe for a thousand years, those who could really be successful in intellectually challenging roles such as (principally) money-lending, were more reproductively successful. So there is a lot of evidence presented, and I buy it, and I don't believe I am racist for buying it, but still - there are a lot of racists who also buy it, and that makes me a bit uncomfortable.Even though the book has a lot of footnotes and a good bibliography, I felt the authors did a poor job of constructing arguments. It seemed they were all over the place, all the time - promising answers and then discursively wandering away from what they promised to answer, never getting back to it. Like on page 91 we are told ""we now understand quite a bit about the genetic changes that led to light skin in northern Eurasians."" Wow! That's a big statement; I was prepared for a big explanation. But a dozen pages of stuff later, they were moving on to another topic; I carefully re-read the intervening pages, which were all quite interesting, but I confirmed that they definitely never delivered on their promised explanation of skin color.I give it 4 stars because I love the subject matter and am fascinated by the implications of the fact that all modern people emerged from a small African population of humans who lived about 50kya. Our written history is so microscopic compared to all of what must have happened - just to know what we can infer from genetics to fill in the blanks is amazing. Unfortunately racists will also find much to love in this book; I can't help that and it's not the fault of the authors either."
158,0465002218,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50953703-groot,5,"The rate of human evolution has accelerated radically over the last 10,000 years. This takes a genetic perspective on history and archaeology, benefiting from the vast improvement in the science and technology of genomic knowledge. Organisms, including people, adapt to changing environments, and our environment is changing radically, starting with the Upper Paleolithic, the introduction of farming, settling into towns, domesticating animals (including milk-yielding species), the vast increase in the number of humans and consequent breeding ground for infectious diseases, literacy and numeracy and their contribution to human prospering for those that could excel at them, and so on. A fascinating book, with some safe and interesting insights, but not shying away from more controversial hypotheses, such as the contributions of proto-humans, such as Neanderthals and Denisovans, to modern humans, with their longer-term adaptations to living in northern climes, possibly contributing lighter skin and other features."

Arguments from natural selection are used to explain patterns in world history, including Europeans' success in displacing Amerindians in the Americas and their failure to displace Africans in the tropical parts of that continent. It's a quick read, and very enlightening.While the authors make their case very clearly, I would have liked to see them explore whether modern medical science -- or demographics in general -- has weakened the link between ""reproductive fitness"" and actual numbers of descendants. Given that so much infectious disease can be treated or controlled, quality food and good sanitation are abundant, and many very ""reproductively fit"" people choose to have small families (or none at all), does their thesis still apply? Will the next 10,000 years be like the last 10,000 were?"

The tens of thousands of years since we left Africa were not enough for evolution to do anything more than tweak us around the edges and the time since the agricultural revolution is a mere blink of an evolutionary eye and human evolution has more or less slowed to a crawl.The 10,000 Year Explosion is evolutionary psychology dialed up to 11. Rather than slowing down, evolution has actually sped up. Genetic change was responsible not just for the agricultural revolution but the scientific and industrial revolutions too, not to mention the rise and fall of empires. Examples of candidate mutations abound. The sum of the books arguments, though was unconvincing. "

With a firm root in evolutionary theory, Cochran and Harpending convinces anyone who isn't blind or an absolute idiot about the impossibility of evolutionary pressures on humans halting to a stop. The authors lays out evolutionary thinking in such a way that the reader will by the end of the book feel a lot more confident in her understanding of the world. It should truly be read by everyone.The book can be read by anyone without any prior knowledge on evolutionary theory. The minimum level of the book is high-school.

The concept of a variant on 'artificial selection' as is observed for dogs and other domesticated animals and plants, seems suggested although not explicit. This seems based on advantages for particular populations, with more offspring among those with particular genetic traits and cultural adaptations such as herding, farming, urbanization, domestic animals such as horses, and improved military weaponry. Pretty persuasive that the process seems ongoing."

Then the modern human out of africa confonrting Neaderteals is also interesting. Then I brought the book with me on my trips to Chengdu with parents and reading became on and off and hard to concentrate. So the middle part of the book is a bit lost to me. Then I returned home and read the last chapter about why a branch of Jews (German Jews) are super smart while bearing more genetic diseases really really interesting and I learned a lot. This last chapter alone make the book deserve a 5 star.

176,0465002218,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12991284-jeremy,3,"As a long time reader of science books I was immediately attracted to this book due to its great title – titles are important, take note publishers. The last science book I read was the great The Fifth Miracle by Paul Davies, which was an examination of how life evolved. Cochran and Harpending’s book promised an argument against the long held theory that humans stopped evolving fifty thousand years ago, just after emerging out of Africa. The book describes itself as the “…the latest edition to the fast emerging discipline of biohistory.” There’s been quite a bit of news related to this area lately, so I thought that it was time to give it a read.The book opens with a refutation of “conventional wisdom”, with the authors claiming that human evolution has accelerated in the last ten thousand years due to various selection pressures, such as agriculture, geographic expansion and climate change. They go on to examine the period that started fifty to forty thousand years ago when modern humans moved into the European territories of the Neanderthal. Ten thousand years later the Neanderthal were extinct and humans were flourishing. No one knows for sure but it seems that humans displayed better adaptations such as advanced language, tools and hunting techniques. There is convincing genetic evidence that we interbreed with Neanderthals and picked up and kept various advantageous genes – just ask Ozzy Osbourne. The ensuing four chapters examine the impact of the advent of agriculture some ten thousand years ago and how the changes to what we ate affected our genetic makeup; the genetic flow of humanity as expressed by selective sweeps of particular genes and also the impact of expansion on humans throughout the globe. A succinct summary - but if you want to know the facts then read the book! But is it worth reading?The ideas presented in The 10,000 Year Explosion are certainly well argued. The authors blend history, archaeology, paleontology and biology to weave their arguments convincingly. They refer to their work as “genetic history” – a “new kind of history.” This is all very well but unfortunately the flaw of this book is that the writing style is relatively bland. There is an effort to engage and give the facts some personality, but as interested as I was in the arguments presented I often found myself bored. I believe that writing popular science is a tricky thing, because, after all, you don’t want to dumb it down; but also you don’t want to put the average reader off either. After reading this book I appreciate science writers such as Paul Davies and Marcus Chown for their efforts to both explain and engage.The 10,000 Year Explosion ends with a case study of the Ashkenazi Jews – Jews that were confined to Europe from medieval times and that were restricted to money lending and clerical professions; the kind of jobs that required a certain level of intelligence. The combination of the demands of their profession and their tendency to marry within their faith meant that the European Jews were selected for a higher intelligence than Jews in the Middle East. Five hundred or so years later descendants of this group were making the major scientific breakthroughs throughout many disciplines and they also displayed higher IQs than other groups. A fascinating case study, but once again the bland writing created a nagging sense of boredom.The story of human evolution is an amazing tale to behold - one that’s obsessed me on and off for years. It’s compelling, fascinating and most of all it’s our story. Unfortunately this book does not really capture the sense of wonder that our story can engender, which is a shame. Read this book if you want the facts, but perhaps look elsewhere if you want to feel that elusive sense of wonder. Although I was slightly disappointed overall, the one interesting thing this book did do for me was to make me ponder just how our present point in human evolutionary history will be viewed in five hundred years; and that’s not such a bad thing."
177,0465002218,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17431775-schwarzenberger,3,"Considering the subject matter, it is a light read with a lot of little tidbits thrown in about how many relatives Genghis Khan has that are still living across central Asia, how disease really helped Pizarro and only 168 soldiers tear apart the Inca Empire, where blue eyes originated, and other such scientific matters that make great dinner conversation and cocktail party opening lines.By the way, i like the cover with the almost stroboscopic depiction of evolutionary influenced skeletal uprightness and locomotion. It is a grabber of a design that gets your eye from across the floor of the library or bookshop.The authors may not like this, but I am giving away a highly kept secret they mention in the index--Yes I actually do read indices, to me they give a sense of the real core of a book and let you know what the authors think is really important. If you have limited time perusing the index gets you right to the action. Well, in the index there is an entry--Lost Dutchman Mine, location, 400. I guess this means that one or both of the authors knows where this reputedly amazingly rich gold mine is hidden. It is a legend in its own right, I'm sure there are some good books about it and Wikipedia says people are still looking for it. The authors know where it is and they are telling you. It is all on page 400! However, my paperback edition (2010) only has 288 pages including the index. It's a wonderfully hidden joke that I did not see mentioned in any other review. I guess we'll have to wait another 10,000 years for the ""20,000 Year Explosion"" followup edition that will explain how humans have evolved since the demise of print books, audio CDs, broadcast television, sidewalks and other signs of civilization. Hopefully this newer edition will have a page 400.To me this was a fascinating read. ""Explosion"" discusses human genetics and evolution, a subject that I have found interesting for a long time but have not actually had the patience to really delve into in order to get a comprehensive basis for true knowledge--I feel that it would take a little more time than I want to dedicate to find out more about organic chemistry and processes of how organic molecules act and react with other to make up DNA mechanisms, and how that affects how life works etc. I did tackle ""The Eight Day of Creation"" some decades ago...what I read of it was fascinating but then life's personal activities got in the way. But the thing that really stopped me was that I kept the used copy (It cost only 1 dollar) of the book I bought on a back shelf for about 10 years and then when I finally started reading it and got a little more than half way through--it is an 800 page monster--I realized that it was mis-bound and many pages were duplicated but also very mixed up and completely out of order. More importantly, a lot was missing overall and the local library didn't have a copy that that could be loaned out to read. I was not going to sit in the library and work my way through it. So basically, that's now where I left my knowledge of genes and DNA and alleles and the mechanics of genetics.That said, I did appreciate the simplification in general that the authors made to get their point across. That point is that we are still evolving, our physiology is still reacting to the environment around us trying to adapt us in the best way possible to allow for species survival and thriving. It's a good read and will get me to read more about this subject. Parts of their theses reminded me of Julian Jaynes' book with that wonderful title--""The Development of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind"" and his theory that we humans finally realized that it wasn't the Gods talking to each and every one of us, it was just our brains finally melding messages together across the corpus callosum inside each of our skulls."
178,0465002218,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1219617-erik,3,"Cochran and Harpending dispel the long-held scientific notion that human evolution reached a plateau tens of thousands of years ago, as well as all change has been cultural. Instead, they argue that cultural change has effected genetic change, and vice versa. Not only did agriculture select for certain characteristics – like lactose tolerance as a result of animal husbandry, for one – but so introgression with Neanderthals, which has been historically frowned upon in the scientific community due to biased in favor of the notion homo sapiens purity. ""The explosion is ongoing: Human evolution didn’t stop when anatomically modern humans appeared, or when they expanded out of Africa. It never stopped – and why would it? Evolutionary stasis requires a static environment, whereas behavioral modernity is all about innovation and change. Stability is exactly what we have not had. This should be obvious, but instead the human sciences have labored under the strange idea that evolution stopped 40,000 years ago.""One of their most controversial notions is their well-supported argument that the Ashkenazi Jews of Eastern Europe have a genetic propensity for higher intelligence as a direct result of marriage only within their community combined with societal pressures against intermarriage with gentiles, strict limitations on what kinds of white-collars jobs they could hold (banking, finance, science), and the resulting economic rewards for succeeding economically (higher birth rate, better heated homes, more personal privacy in those homes that helped thwart contact with diseases fatal to the more impoverished, etc.). All of these combined set the conditions for natural selection that resulted in a better-educated and genetically-insular population with a slightly higher-than-average IQ when compared to the other European genetic groups that they lived alongside. Perhaps this is a stretch for the politically correct crowd, but it certainly is worthy of reasoned debate and consideration. (On the flip side, Cochran and Harpending are quick to remind us that the Ashkenazi Jews also have an accompanying genetic predisposition for various diseases that other groups do not have.)As an educator, I was particularly struck by their assertion that ""Nongenetic factors also influence IQ, but for the most part, the ones that matter are not the ones people thought would matter. Prenatal care, breastfeeding, nutrition, access to early education, Mozart in the womb, and oat bran all have little or no effect. Surprisingly, the way in which a family raised children seems to have no effect on adult IQ.""Alas, neither Cochran nor Harpending go on to detail just what nongenetic factors can or do influence IQ. (I would argue that the quality of formal education be one.)On a style note, I admit to wishing several times for either Richard Dawkins or Jared Diamond’s more persuasive and personable narrative styles. (No surprise, Diamond’s Guns, Germs, and Steel and The Third Chimpanzee are both quoted numerous times.) Of course, knowing that this is the first book between the Cochran and Harpending, I imagine that they will both improve in this area in future books the co-write. "
179,0465002218,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4975079-daniel-hammer,4,"This is just the kind of exciting, accessible and provocative science that I like to read about. For the most part. Cochran and Harpending's book presents the argument that human evolution has increased in pace over the last 10,000 years. This is in contrast to a more standard view which argues that, due to the ability to culturally and technologically reshape our environment, modern human beings have less of a need to evolve biologically in response to environmental pressures. He begins with a few basics of populations genetic which support the likelihood of an increased rate of evolution in recent times. Among these are the increase in human population numbers; more people equals more chances for mutations to develop. Also important is the fact that our diets have changed more in the past 10,000 years than had hominin diets for the previous several million years. This would have introduced significant dietary pressures on us, and those who could tolerate or process certain foods (such as lactose) would be more evolutionarily successful. 10,000 years ago is a key starting point because it corresponds with the advent of agriculture, which introduced larger populations, new diets, crowded living, and more.Cochran and Harpending survey a range or very interesting ideas. They argue that humans almost definitely bred with Neanderthals. That lactose tolerance was a key to the spread of Indo-European languages, via the adaptable, milk-drinking people which spoke those tongues. They examine a number of genetic mutations which are limited to certain populations and reflect recent genetic (evolutionary) responses to environment and diet, like sickle-cell trait. They suggest that light skin color may have evolved for more than just the ability to synthesize more vitamin D, and that the human brain likely underwent important structural changes just in the past 30,000 years.All of this is seriously interesting, and a pleasure to read and debate. The downside is that Cochran and Harpending are slim on evidence for much of this. I an inclined to believe they are largely correct, but too often the book reads like a laundry list of exciting suggestions, without much to back them up.This book certainly worth a quick read and makes some great food for thought."
180,0465002218,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19773041-joseph-hirsch,3,"Depending on a whole host of factors (your scientific background, religion, personal experiences, and biases, to name a few) one could come away from ""The 10,000 Year Explosion"" thinking that anthropologist Greg Cochran is an intellectually voracious man who wants to know where and how humans differ in their genes in order to cure diseases and increase social harmony, or conversely, that he is a latter-day Cesare Lombroso who wants to bust out the calipers to measure our heads to find out which of us have seed worth saving for his eugenic experiments and which of us need to undergo forced sterilization.Having read his ""10,000 Year Explosion"" written by Cochran in conjunction with geneticist Henry Harpending, I found the authors to be intelligent, humorous men capable of explaining very, very complicated concepts in a way that did not scare off this layman. The problem I had with the book was not some kind of moral objection (science doesn't care about my feelings) but rather the nagging sense that this was a paper or presentation stretched out to book length, and that any one of the ideas explicated in the book in one chapter would have made a great book in itself. Dr (?) Cochran cites Jared Diamond's ""Guns, Germs, and Steel"" multiple times throughout the book; I just wish he'd taken the same sort of ""deep dive"" approach to this book in terms of its structure and breadth. In brief (and it's hard to be brief with this information) Cochran argues that human evolution did not stop roughly 40,000 years ago as many believe, and that evolution is an ongoing process, and that this process can ""explode"" in a very local and idiosyncratic way, based on everything from rigorous man-made laws (especially regarding things like out-marriage) to civic arrangements (one of the more disturbing but fascinating detours in the book holds that once humans shifted from hunter-gatherers to agrarians, we started to favor the conforming and even servile over the independent and strong).Someone, in an attempt to summarize this book, called it something like an exploration of history through the lens of genetics, which would be a pretty good capitulation. The authors take the reader from ancient Asian Steppes where Mongol hordes perfected a simple but effective reproduction strategy (kill the men and mate with the women), all the way forward in time to an Israeli hospital in the twenty-first, where the idea that genetic advantages can become disadvantages or can even be made irrelevant is explored. As previously mentioned, all of the subjects dealt with are fascinating, and presented in a clear manner. But it's a bit too thumbnail for my taste. Your take might differ. I'd certainly take a class with Dr. Cochran, though, if I were still in college. I imagine it would be easy to stay awake during his seminars. "
181,0465002218,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32156837-mike,5,"This is a fascinating book on the mutual influence of genes on culture and of culture on genes. The ""explosion"" referred to in the title was the advent of agriculture, which greatly multiplied the size of the human population, greatly altered culture, and redirected human evolution down new paths to adapt to this new culture. When human population increased the rate of genetic mutations increased correspondingly, which increased the rate of evolution (by 100 fold according to the authors). Humans, especially those in densely populated areas, have been evolving rapidly in the last 10,000 years--and their evolution is driven by their environment, including their culture. But, then, newly evolved humans, being different from their ancestors, develop different cultural environments more suitable to their nature. Thus, evolution and human culture form a feedback loop. Of course, in a world of relatively isolated regional and local populations, their will be different natural/cultural environments, hence differential evolution to adapt to them. Inuit amidst ice flows and tundra would not (and did not) evolve the same way as Melanesians on their tropical islands. And evolution may proceed quite rapidly under certain circumstances, particularly large population size and major environmental impetus. On top of well supported scientific theory, the authors add numerous examples of evolution-culture interaction throughout history. It's an important new perspective on history. The style of writing is clear, needless academic jargon wisely jettisoned. The historical examples that run through the book seem somewhat arbitrarily chosen, but, this being a relatively new field of inquiry, the authors are probably just following the trail of such evidence as we currently have. The newness also means we face some uncertainties of interpretation. The authors note evidential limitations when present, but are bold to cast forth their nets in some clever speculations, one of which has been confirmed since publication (non-African humans have some Neanderthal DNA). This is what scientists do and are meant to do when faced with uncertainty: formulate hypotheses, preferably intelligent, informed ones. In this book, we have something of a hybrid beast: a populist approach with some vanguard hypothesizing. "
182,0465002218,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5466619-naftoli,5,"This book has opened my eyes to so many issues; to say that it is transformative is understatement. I had been taught in college that human evolution stopped with the advent of culture, that culture made adjustments to the environment thus eliminating the need for biology to fine tune our bodies. I had also been trained to view IQ tests as simply racist tools used by white patriarchal society to convince the priveleged that minority people are inferior - it sounds hyperbolic but I was actually told this by professors! I had also been taught that all humans are essentially the same (one world, one people, that race is only skin deep). When confronted with differences in intelligence, adaptability, etc. I was taught that this is due to political inequities, war, in short, culture. This book challenges these biases. I will no doubt read this book again at some later date and refer to it from time to time. I am not trained as a scientist so I will have to review and re-review the data from time to time. I was trained as a social scientist - cultural anthropology - so I am the target audience for this book. The issue regarding Neanderthals and what became of them is one of the first issues undertaken in this work; I found it to be both realistic and reasonable. The authors rely on population genetics, mathematics, extrapolations, &c in an effort to buttress their position that modern humans have inherited a small but important percentage of Neanderthal genetic material. It makes sense to me.Among so many things, I admire the authors for having the courage to challenge our current received wisdom. It seems to me that they have taken quite a risk in doing so as there is nothing 'politically correct' about this book. The authors even point to data that most writers shy away from as it may cast them in a negative light. Whatever the reason for shying away from data, it is vital that we humans look facts straight in the face and deal with the realities of our evolution, our cultural wisdom and ethnocentricities, and our impact upon this planet. At the minimum, debate these issues rather than labeling and dismissing them. This book tackles a few of these issues."
183,0465002218,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4534780-alina,5,"The old thinking is that, when cultural evolution took off, biological evolution stopped -- because instead of being shaped by our environment, we began shaping our environment to us. That idea always seemed reasonable to me, but this book has changed my mind. The authors contend that, on the contrary, evolution has sped up since the neolithic revolution. The social innovations associated with agriculture and civilization mean we have subjected ourselves to major new environmental pressures, and that has fueled rapid natural selection. Their idea is that cultural evolution interacts with biological evolution; the two drive each other. One of the book's points is that natural selection isn't as slow as is often believed, since altering just one gene or even one nucleotide can sometimes result in important advantages. By examining evidence from the exploding field of population genetics, as well as other sources, the authors find indications of significant biological change in the past 10,000 years or so. Examples include differing disease resistance in response to local conditions, the development of lactose tolerance in dairy farmers, and selection for higher intelligence among Ashkenazi Jews. Although I'd heard of some of these things before, I hadn't appreciated the impact on history. The authors make a convincing case that genetic factors can be decisive. I no longer think of biological evolution as something that stopped being important once modern humans came into existence."

那么为何德系犹太人特别聪慧呢？想要解答这个谜题，或许我们可以看看关于阿什肯纳兹犹太人的DNA我们都知道些什么，因为事实证明它们还有另一个有趣的特征。即，它们有一组不常见的严重遗传病，例如家族性黑蒙性痴呆症、高雪氏病、家族性自主神经功能异常，以及两种不同形式的遗传性乳腺癌（BRCA1和BRCA2），这些疾病在阿什肯纳兹犹太人群体中的发病率比在其他欧洲人群中高将近100倍。我们相信这两个谜题有单一的解释。我们认为阿什肯纳兹犹太人在北欧逗留的时期在白领职业的自然选择中获得了成功，而这成功源自他们智力上的遗传优势。但对于智力的强势选择也产生了一些让人不愉快的副作用：提高遗传携带者智商的等位基因同时也对纯合体产生损害。这一类解释自然是有争议的。事实上很多人排斥这一类说法：智力是可测量的，由遗传决定的，不同的人类群体间有智力上的差异。有趣的是，这些批评和斥责甚少来自从事认知测试及其结果分析的科学工作者。业内对此很少或几乎没有任何争议，智商测试是准确的，测试结果能预测学术成就和个体生活的其他方面，而且智商值有极高的遗传率。如果遗传的确能影响智力，那么一段时间后，智力带来的繁殖优势必然会带来更高的智力。这个简单的逻辑是关于自然选择的演化理论的核心：能增加繁殖的基因在人类群体中会随时间推移变得越来越常见。.................我们认为印欧扩张起始于乳糖耐受突变的频率增高，当其频率增高至足以使整个人群转型从事制乳业经济的时候，印欧人就迅速扩散至整个南俄大草原。这迅速的扩张就有可能导致说近似语言的同一人群分散在从当今的乌克兰直到乌拉尔河地区这一广阔区域。因为扩张如此迅速，语言还没有分化，所以这一广大区域中分散的人群说的还是相似的语言。印欧人前进的步伐持续至进入欧洲，在那里制乳业在生态学效应上足以跟早期农业竞争，而且前者催生了一种远远更具侵略性的文化。印欧文化很可能是更好战的，因为印欧人群的高机动性、更多的人口数量和更好的营养使他们能比其他人群更经常赢得战争。而他们的胜利反过来又会提升他们的军事行动效率，从而成功哺育了更多成功。从印欧人基因在欧洲基因库占的相对低的比例来看，他们似乎实行的是精英统治，做被征服人群的统治者但没有摧毁或替代原先的居住者。然而相对小的精英人口常常能够让所有其余人口说他们的语言。此外，印欧人还把乳糖耐受的等位基因加进了本地的混合基因库。乳糖耐受突变在印欧人入侵前的欧洲很罕见或根本不存在，然而当制乳业受自然选择青睐的时候，它就在欧洲变得很常见了，特别是在北欧。[20]印欧语言和文化在制乳业流行的地域传播扩散，比方说，它们还进入了南欧和伊朗，然而中东的强势国家们似乎阻止了这些语言文化进入中东。我们认为印欧扩张起始于乳糖耐受突变的频率增高，当其频率增高至足以使整个人群转型从事制乳业经济的时候，印欧人就迅速扩散至整个南俄大草原。这迅速的扩张就有可能导致说近似语言的同一人群分散在从当今的乌克兰直到乌拉尔河地区这一广阔区域。因为扩张如此迅速，语言还没有分化，所以这一广大区域中分散的人群说的还是相似的语言。印欧人前进的步伐持续至进入欧洲，在那里制乳业在生态学效应上足以跟早期农业竞争，而且前者催生了一种远远更具侵略性的文化。印欧文化很可能是更好战的，因为印欧人群的高机动性、更多的人口数量和更好的营养使他们能比其他人群更经常赢得战争。而他们的胜利反过来又会提升他们的军事行动效率，从而成功哺育了更多成功。从印欧人基因在欧洲基因库占的相对低的比例来看，他们似乎实行的是精英统治，做被征服人群的统治者但没有摧毁或替代原先的居住者。然而相对小的精英人口常常能够让所有其余人口说他们的语言。此外，印欧人还把乳糖耐受的等位基因加进了本地的混合基因库。乳糖耐受突变在印欧人入侵前的欧洲很罕见或根本不存在，然而当制乳业受自然选择青睐的时候，它就在欧洲变得很常见了，特别是在北欧。[20]印欧语言和文化在制乳业流行的地域传播扩散，比方说，它们还进入了南欧和伊朗，然而中东的强势国家们似乎阻止了这些语言文化进入中东。.......一开始他们是作为基督教与穆斯林世界的中介的国际商人。然而随着穆斯林和基督徒（特别是意大利人）逐渐开始直接通商，阿什肯纳兹犹太商人越来越多地开始从事本地贸易。当对犹太人的迫害越来越严重从而长距离旅行无法得到安全保障之后，德系犹太人越来越专注于金融业，这个行业对他们是敞开的，因为基督徒被禁止放高利贷。在公元1100年前绝大部分德系犹太人都是放贷者，这一模式延续了几个世纪。[15]这些职业（交易和金融业）有很高的智商需求，我们可以肯定没有其他人类群体有这么高数量比例的人口在长时段内从事需要很高认知能力的职业。有时我们能找到相当详尽的阿什肯纳兹犹太人的商业活动记录。比如关于南法鲁西永犹太人在约公元1270年就有这样的记录：“有全面证据证明这群犹太人以放贷为生，实质上完全没有从事任何其他种类的经济活动。有记录的228名男性犹太人中近八成在向他们的基督教邻居放贷。犹太女人（几乎都是寡妇）放贷的也很常见，这些来自弱势者的资本被投资到相似的渠道。并且最积极从事放贷的犹太人似乎在他们的群体内是最受尊崇的。................他们曾是波兰立陶宛王国的管理者阶层。除了读写能力之外，在这些特定职业上取得成功所依靠的是类似于现今商人的素质，至少也需要有追踪复杂交易和资金流动的能力。最终，随着波兰立陶宛王国的阿什肯纳兹犹太人人口数量上升，越来越多的犹太人成了手工艺者——毕竟对管理和金融职业的需求也是有一定限度的。然而在800到900年的时间段内，也就是大致从公元800年到公元1650或1700年，绝大部分的阿什肯纳兹犹太人从事的是管理和金融业，也就是复杂度很高的职业，他们几乎从来不当农民和匠人。在这个方面他们和所有其他定居人口都有所不同。事实上，在那个时代任何占有领地的人类族群都不可能有那么高比例的人口从事白领职业，因为这样农业生产率就会过低。九成的人口都必须务农，从而生产足够的粮食去养活他们自己和社会顶层少量的统治者、文员、士兵、匠人以及商人。对白领职业的自然选择只有在这一阶层独自成为一个族群的时候才有可能成功，这一族群必须靠职业而非其据地而界定。在高复杂度职业中取得成功的犹太人享有更高的遗传优势。学者怀里波说：“在富裕的家庭中有更多的孩子能活到成年。总体上属于更富裕阶层的许多商业领袖、显赫拉比、群体领袖和类似个体的谱系显示，这些人通常有4个、6个甚至8～9个孩子活到成年。........智商有很高的可遗传性。这意味着一个个体的智商值会部分取决于遗传影响，从而更接近他或她的父母和兄弟姐妹而不是随便哪个别人。同一对父母生下的子女即便在不同环境下养大也会有相近的智商值，而领养的兄弟姐妹即便在同一屋檐下长大也不会有相近的智商值。高度也是类似的：长得高的人更可能有高于平均身高的子女。事实上，成年人的智商值与身高一样主要受遗传因素影响。然而童年的智商值却受遗传影响更少，而更容易受周围环境影响。周围环境对儿童智商测试结果的影响会在青春期期间或其后消失，这成了美国先锋计划（Head Start Program）的基础，即宣扬智商值能因一定干预而提高。非遗传因素同样会影响智商值，但很多情况下那些起作用的因素都不是人们想象会起作用的因素。父母关爱、母乳喂养、营养情况、早教、子宫中听莫扎特音乐和燕麦麸几乎都没起什么作用。而让人惊讶的是，一个家庭养育孩子的方式看起来对孩子成年时的智商值没有任何影响。这有效地反驳了一些流行的环境决定论——它们对阿什肯纳兹犹太人的高智商做各种成长环境方面的解释，尤其反驳了那些认为犹太母亲用特殊的方式抚养孩子催发了他们的高智商的论调。...在阿什肯纳兹犹太人特别高发的遗传病中，广为人知的是家族性黑蒙性痴呆症、高雪氏病和BRCA1与BRCA2乳腺癌突变，但同时还有许多其他的疾病，比如尼曼匹克症、卡纳万病和家族性自主神经功能异常。有些会引起神经方面的问题。它们在阿什肯纳兹犹太人身上特别高发，这已经成了人类遗传学上一个长久的谜题。.....是什么样的性征在阿什肯纳兹犹太人身上比在他们的邻居身上更宝贵呢？嗯，我们有一些很强的线索。是什么性征在当今的德系犹太人身上最突出呢？他们是壮大如萨摩亚人，高如图西族人，以及牛奶耐受如荷兰人吗？不是的，他们的特殊性征就是智力。这些突变体本身就提示了这一点：它们中的一些看起来就很像会提高智商的，考虑到它们作用于中枢神经系统的发展。鞘脂类突变体特别有可能具有提升智力的作用。在每一种这类突变体中，都有一些特定鞘脂累积；这些鞘脂是变更过的脂类分子，它们在信号传输中起作用，并在神经组织中特别常见。研究者已经确定这些鞘脂类作用水平的提升会引致神经元（中枢神经系统的基本细胞）之间更多的连接（高雪氏病的轴突生长）。在家族性黑蒙性痴呆症的情形中有相似的效应：特定的累积混合物（GM2神经节苷脂）作用水平提升会促进树突（连接神经元的纤细多分支突起）的增长。[41]这种树突生成的增加现象也同样发生在A型尼曼匹克细胞出现、动物版黑蒙性痴呆症和尼曼匹克病的情形下。这些都是已知的疾病等位基因中唯一能引致神经连接增加的因素。我们同时还有（并不确凿的）证据证明德系犹太人身上常见的一些基因变异有可能提升智力。我们研究了耶路撒冷高雪氏病患者的职业——实际上是所有在耶路撒冷沙尔泽德克医学中心（Shaare Zedek Medical Centre）治疗的患者。这些患者成为工程师或科学家的概率比以色列阿什肯纳兹犹太人从事这些职业的平均概率要高很多，事实上大概要高11倍。[42]关于阿什肯纳兹犹太人的另一种遗传病扭转性肌张力障碍也有类似的研究结果。这种遗传病最初被诊断出来的时候，研究者就已经开始注意到其患者不同寻常的智力水平。.....结论文化革新在很长的时间里都是人类生物学变化的驱动力，在约250万年前人类开始使用工具之后就一直如此。自然选择青睐那些从事早期文化革新的原始人类大脑，而这些革新本身就导向更多身体和心理上的变化。生物学特征和文化特征的协同演化一开始是很缓慢的，至少以现代标准看是慢的，但渐渐演化速度就快起来了。考古学记录显示我们的革新能力持续上升，直至约4万年前，我们已经为所谓的“人类革命”或旧石器时代晚期欧洲和亚洲北部的“创造性大爆发”蓄势待发。技术和艺术的突然兴盛发生在人类扩张并走出非洲的不久以后；它同时也跟生物学变化有关，而我们猜想这些生物学变化部分是由从尼安德特人或其他远古人类（亚洲大陆更早的占据者）身上偷得的基因驱动的。行为现代化导致更多的变化：人类制作更精良的工具，然后他们在数代人的时间里也反过来被这些工具不断塑造变化。农业出现之后，文化和生物演化都加速了，因为新的生活方式使人们有了新的需求。农业出现以前人类一直都是觅食者：农业带来的人口急剧增加使得更多有益的变异体出现，也使得更多新想法出现。我们人类在农业传播后的快速演化的确是一万年的爆发。 这爆发如今还在持续：人类演化并没有止步于解剖学意义上的现代人类出现，或他们扩张走出非洲的时候。它从来没有停止。而且它怎么会停下呢？演化停滞需要一个静滞的环境，而行为现代化一直带来的都是革新和变化。一直以来我们都不曾有稳定和静滞的环境。这一点应该是很明显的，然而人类科学不仅忽视了它，相反还一直在一个奇怪的前提下辛勤地做研究，这个奇怪的想法认为演化在4万年前就停止了。 所有这些都意味着也必然意味着，生物变化是驱动历史的重要因素。当然它不是唯一的因素，而且很奇怪的是，它还被与更传统的影响绑定在一起。诸如乳糖耐受一类的遗传变化的出现和传播是文化革新（例如农业的发展）的结果，它同时也源自随机出现的合适的突变。这些遗传变化反过来也对文化产生了影响。印欧人的扩张，欧洲人在北美和澳大利亚的成功定居，“瓜分非洲”的失败，阿什肯纳兹犹太人进入智力舞台，甚至有可能工业革命和科学的兴起，所有这些看来都是生物和文化变化之永恒的舞步所营造的。 如果人类科学的研究者们继续忽略自然选择从未停止作用这一事实，他们就会把许多重要问题的解答线索给丢掉，把谜题变成秘密。科尔特斯带着500人就征服并控制了几百万人的帝国。想要解释这件事情而不提持续演化带来的疾病抵御机制中的生物学差异，这完全不可能。公元前5世纪的修昔底德说人类特征是不会变化的，所以可以预测，而当今许多科学家相信人类特征几万年前就停止了改变。历史学家们似乎一直以此为研究的前提。然而这样一来他们就忽略了巨大的契机，不仅在于解读人类的往昔，而且也在于塑造未来。贯穿人类历史的持续演化一直是一个巨大的自然界的实验，这个实验承诺了我们在理解自身、抵御疾病和精神病症方面的巨大的成果。利莫内苏尔加尔达隐藏着关于人类疾病的一个重要线索。世界上大概有100万个这样的小村庄，一定有更多类似的线索等待我们去发现。人类历史为我们展现的一些实验的成果甚至有可能帮助我们进行更有野心的尝试，去增加人类寿命和认知能力。从事人类科学的学者们是时候去甩掉一系列关于演化停止和“心理均一”的僵化教条了。每一刻时间都很宝贵，我们有一整个世界要去争取呢。"
185,0465002218,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16831597-fran-globlek,4,"The authors manage to spoil many thought-provoking observations with a careless approach to logic and underwhelming scientific rigour. I will give it 4/5 on account of me enjoying the ideas. These ideas, however, convince me to the extent of them ""making sense"". As a scientist I do expect much more in order to be convinced. I understand that this would make the book significantly longer and it might not necessarily be aimed for the ""general public"", but I would argue that here we don't really see the case of oversimplification being the issue, since the ideas, terminology, methodology described etc. are not necessarily ""dumbed down"". Instead, there is a certain haughty attitude - judging by this book alone, everybody other than the authors thinks genetic changes in human beings stopped 40,000 years ago and is wholly dogmatic. "
186,0465002218,http://goodreads.com/user/show/77887124-paul-clark,1,"This book rejects the view that race is primarily a social construct and proposes five hypotheses about genetic differences between ethnic groups. The first two, lactose tolerance and resistance to pathogens, are physiological and uncontroversial. The same cannot be said of the other three: that interbreeding between Eurasians and Neanderthals increased Eurasian intelligence, that long-term exposure to agriculture leads to a greater predisposition to the ‘bourgeois’ values of hard work and restraint, and that medieval restrictions on Ashkenazi Jews raised their intelligence. This review will focus on these three hypotheses.THE NEANDERTHAL ADVANTAGEHomo sapiens first encountered Neanderthals after leaving Africa 40,000 years ago. Cochran and Harpending speculate that interbreeding between the two species raised Eurasian intelligence, triggering the Upper Palaeolithic revolution in technology, symbolic behaviour and socio-economic organisation. Quite how sub-Saharan Africans later managed the same transition to modern behaviour without the benefit of Neanderthal DNA, the authors do not say.In any case, many archaeologists favour non-genetic explanations for the transition. Others argue that it occurred in Africa much earlier, citing discoveries like a large 70,000 year-old settlement in Sudan and sophisticated 44,000 year-old southern African artefacts. If critics of the Upper Palaeolithic model turn out to be correct, Cochran and Harpending’s highly speculative hypothesis would be falsified.THE AGRICULTURAL REVOLUTION AND BOURGEOIS VALUESThe authors claim that the development of agriculture led to the spread of genes for hard work and restraint among those populations in the Middle East, East Asia and Europe that have been exposed to agriculture for longest.Whilst superficially convincing, their account has serious flaws. The most glaring is the claim that ADHD has been bred out of China, where it actually affects up to 5% of schoolchildren. Other claims presented as facts are in reality matters of dispute. Agriculture might have arisen in sub-Saharan Africa 1,000 years earlier than the authors state, and their claim that Australian Aborigines never developed agriculture is contested.In most pre-capitalist societies, hard work did not have the significance the authors give it because any attempt to rise above your station was seen as sinful and peasants generally did as little work as they could get away with. The way people accumulated wealth was to squeeze it out of someone else as a warlord, a landlord or the holder of a sinecure that enabled them to milk others.Traders who acquired wealth through hard work dreamed of turning it into land, finding an impoverished noble family to marry into and putting their feet up. The only ones unable to do this were religious minorities like Armenians, Jews, Lebanese and Parsees. Cochran and Harpending claim that bourgeois genes made these communities successful middlemen when in fact it was their minority religion that trapped them in this niche.Similarly dubious is the claim that a lack of bourgeois genes fuels opposition to neo-liberalism in Latin America. Surely the growth of the industrial working class is a better explanation for the influence of socialism there.The authors contrast farmers who refrain from eating their seed corn with hunter gatherers who scupper efforts to turn them into herders by eating all their goats. But are hunter gatherers really so stupid? Or is this a case of a top-down innovation deliberately sabotaged by a community that never wanted it?The claim that aggression has been bred out of those populations longest exposed to agriculture is undermined by Cohen and Nisbett’s famous study that found startling differences in levels of aggression between genetically indistinguishable people from different cultures.THE INTELLIGENCE OF AHKANAZI JEWSCochran and Harpending’s third controversial hypothesis concerns the high IQs of Ashkenazi Jews, allegedly 12-15 points above other Europeans. They favour the theory that this is genetically determined because medieval north European Jews were restricted to white-collar occupations, particularly money lending, in which only intelligent people could succeed, giving them greater reproductive success in a community where marrying out was forbidden.However, the data they present is superficial. The influence of heritability on IQ shifts during a person’s life, rising dramatically as children grow to adulthood. But the authors never give the ages of the people in their statistics, making them impossible to assess.Their claim that 80% of economically active medieval Ashkenazim were full-time moneylenders is unconvincing, since Jews were confined to ghettoes with separate micro-economies, and rules forbidding the ‘improper subordination’ of Christians by Jews would probably have created the need for a Jewish servant class.Despite these caveats, this hypothesis is credible if unproven. There is no a priori reason why the heritable intelligence of every ethnic group should be the same and the Ashkenazim are a genetically closed community with a unique history.CONCLUSIONSThe 10,000 Year Explosion makes noteworthy points about physiological differences between the races and asks an interesting question about the intelligence of Ashkenazi Jews without quite supplying the answer. But it has conspicuously failed to demonstrate any other link between race and either intelligence or character. Cochran and Harpending’s Neanderthal hypothesis is highly speculative, and their claims about bourgeois values and agriculture rest on questionable evidence and a willingness to ignore simpler and more obvious explanations.Please see my website for a longer and fully sourced version of this review."
187,0465002218,http://goodreads.com/user/show/84499280-david-baer,4,"I got worried reading the introduction, because (among many others) they thanked Phil Rushton, who I remember from a lifetime ago as being in the news in a bad way, as in using his research to either promote or implicitly support racist ideologies. But I continued anyway, because I find the subject matter fascinating.Because, as I opined in my review of Before the Dawn: Recovering the Lost History of Our Ancestors, it's not by definition racist to inquire into the genetic basis of racial variation - it's only racist if you use such inquiry to justify privilege for one group, or even to consider one group as inherently superior to another. So, for example, it's not racist to find the genetic basis for why Kenyans are so successful at long-distance running. It is racist to conclude from that fact, that, I don't know, say, ""driving while black"" isn't really a thing. Or that separation of the ""races"" is a good thing, etc etc.This book isn't racist, in my opinion - but I understand how it could come off as such. The thing about Ashkenazi Jews having enhanced intelligence has a certain taint to it, because it's been used to justify (racist) hierarchies of the ""races"". And this thing about the Ashkenazi Jews comes up again and again: because they experienced unique conditions of repression in northern Europe for a thousand years, those who could really be successful in intellectually challenging roles such as (principally) money-lending, were more reproductively successful. So there is a lot of evidence presented, and I buy it, and I don't believe I am racist for buying it, but still - there are a lot of racists who also buy it, and that makes me a bit uncomfortable.Even though the book has a lot of footnotes and a good bibliography, I felt the authors did a poor job of constructing arguments. It seemed they were all over the place, all the time - promising answers and then discursively wandering away from what they promised to answer, never getting back to it. Like on page 91 we are told ""we now understand quite a bit about the genetic changes that led to light skin in northern Eurasians."" Wow! That's a big statement; I was prepared for a big explanation. But a dozen pages of stuff later, they were moving on to another topic; I carefully re-read the intervening pages, which were all quite interesting, but I confirmed that they definitely never delivered on their promised explanation of skin color.I give it 4 stars because I love the subject matter and am fascinated by the implications of the fact that all modern people emerged from a small African population of humans who lived about 50kya. Our written history is so microscopic compared to all of what must have happened - just to know what we can infer from genetics to fill in the blanks is amazing. Unfortunately racists will also find much to love in this book; I can't help that and it's not the fault of the authors either."

This takes a genetic perspective on history and archaeology, benefiting from the vast improvement in the science and technology of genomic knowledge. Organisms, including people, adapt to changing environments, and our environment is changing radically, starting with the Upper Paleolithic, the introduction of farming, settling into towns, domesticating animals (including milk-yielding species), the vast increase in the number of humans and consequent breeding ground for infectious diseases, literacy and numeracy and their contribution to human prospering for those that could excel at them, and so on. A fascinating book, with some safe and interesting insights, but not shying away from more controversial hypotheses, such as the contributions of proto-humans, such as Neanderthals and Denisovans, to modern humans, with their longer-term adaptations to living in northern climes, possibly contributing lighter skin and other features."

Arguments from natural selection are used to explain patterns in world history, including Europeans' success in displacing Amerindians in the Americas and their failure to displace Africans in the tropical parts of that continent. It's a quick read, and very enlightening.While the authors make their case very clearly, I would have liked to see them explore whether modern medical science -- or demographics in general -- has weakened the link between ""reproductive fitness"" and actual numbers of descendants. Given that so much infectious disease can be treated or controlled, quality food and good sanitation are abundant, and many very ""reproductively fit"" people choose to have small families (or none at all), does their thesis still apply? Will the next 10,000 years be like the last 10,000 were?"

The tens of thousands of years since we left Africa were not enough for evolution to do anything more than tweak us around the edges and the time since the agricultural revolution is a mere blink of an evolutionary eye and human evolution has more or less slowed to a crawl.The 10,000 Year Explosion is evolutionary psychology dialed up to 11. Rather than slowing down, evolution has actually sped up. Genetic change was responsible not just for the agricultural revolution but the scientific and industrial revolutions too, not to mention the rise and fall of empires. Examples of candidate mutations abound. The sum of the books arguments, though was unconvincing. "

The authors lays out evolutionary thinking in such a way that the reader will by the end of the book feel a lot more confident in her understanding of the world. It should truly be read by everyone.The book can be read by anyone without any prior knowledge on evolutionary theory. The minimum level of the book is high-school.

The concept of a variant on 'artificial selection' as is observed for dogs and other domesticated animals and plants, seems suggested although not explicit. This seems based on advantages for particular populations, with more offspring among those with particular genetic traits and cultural adaptations such as herding, farming, urbanization, domestic animals such as horses, and improved military weaponry. Pretty persuasive that the process seems ongoing."

Then the modern human out of africa confonrting Neaderteals is also interesting. Then I brought the book with me on my trips to Chengdu with parents and reading became on and off and hard to concentrate. So the middle part of the book is a bit lost to me. Then I returned home and read the last chapter about why a branch of Jews (German Jews) are super smart while bearing more genetic diseases really really interesting and I learned a lot. This last chapter alone make the book deserve a 5 star.

206,0465002218,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12991284-jeremy,3,"As a long time reader of science books I was immediately attracted to this book due to its great title – titles are important, take note publishers. The last science book I read was the great The Fifth Miracle by Paul Davies, which was an examination of how life evolved. Cochran and Harpending’s book promised an argument against the long held theory that humans stopped evolving fifty thousand years ago, just after emerging out of Africa. The book describes itself as the “…the latest edition to the fast emerging discipline of biohistory.” There’s been quite a bit of news related to this area lately, so I thought that it was time to give it a read.The book opens with a refutation of “conventional wisdom”, with the authors claiming that human evolution has accelerated in the last ten thousand years due to various selection pressures, such as agriculture, geographic expansion and climate change. They go on to examine the period that started fifty to forty thousand years ago when modern humans moved into the European territories of the Neanderthal. Ten thousand years later the Neanderthal were extinct and humans were flourishing. No one knows for sure but it seems that humans displayed better adaptations such as advanced language, tools and hunting techniques. There is convincing genetic evidence that we interbreed with Neanderthals and picked up and kept various advantageous genes – just ask Ozzy Osbourne. The ensuing four chapters examine the impact of the advent of agriculture some ten thousand years ago and how the changes to what we ate affected our genetic makeup; the genetic flow of humanity as expressed by selective sweeps of particular genes and also the impact of expansion on humans throughout the globe. A succinct summary - but if you want to know the facts then read the book! But is it worth reading?The ideas presented in The 10,000 Year Explosion are certainly well argued. The authors blend history, archaeology, paleontology and biology to weave their arguments convincingly. They refer to their work as “genetic history” – a “new kind of history.” This is all very well but unfortunately the flaw of this book is that the writing style is relatively bland. There is an effort to engage and give the facts some personality, but as interested as I was in the arguments presented I often found myself bored. I believe that writing popular science is a tricky thing, because, after all, you don’t want to dumb it down; but also you don’t want to put the average reader off either. After reading this book I appreciate science writers such as Paul Davies and Marcus Chown for their efforts to both explain and engage.The 10,000 Year Explosion ends with a case study of the Ashkenazi Jews – Jews that were confined to Europe from medieval times and that were restricted to money lending and clerical professions; the kind of jobs that required a certain level of intelligence. The combination of the demands of their profession and their tendency to marry within their faith meant that the European Jews were selected for a higher intelligence than Jews in the Middle East. Five hundred or so years later descendants of this group were making the major scientific breakthroughs throughout many disciplines and they also displayed higher IQs than other groups. A fascinating case study, but once again the bland writing created a nagging sense of boredom.The story of human evolution is an amazing tale to behold - one that’s obsessed me on and off for years. It’s compelling, fascinating and most of all it’s our story. Unfortunately this book does not really capture the sense of wonder that our story can engender, which is a shame. Read this book if you want the facts, but perhaps look elsewhere if you want to feel that elusive sense of wonder. Although I was slightly disappointed overall, the one interesting thing this book did do for me was to make me ponder just how our present point in human evolutionary history will be viewed in five hundred years; and that’s not such a bad thing."
207,0465002218,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17431775-schwarzenberger,3,"Considering the subject matter, it is a light read with a lot of little tidbits thrown in about how many relatives Genghis Khan has that are still living across central Asia, how disease really helped Pizarro and only 168 soldiers tear apart the Inca Empire, where blue eyes originated, and other such scientific matters that make great dinner conversation and cocktail party opening lines.By the way, i like the cover with the almost stroboscopic depiction of evolutionary influenced skeletal uprightness and locomotion. It is a grabber of a design that gets your eye from across the floor of the library or bookshop.The authors may not like this, but I am giving away a highly kept secret they mention in the index--Yes I actually do read indices, to me they give a sense of the real core of a book and let you know what the authors think is really important. If you have limited time perusing the index gets you right to the action. Well, in the index there is an entry--Lost Dutchman Mine, location, 400. I guess this means that one or both of the authors knows where this reputedly amazingly rich gold mine is hidden. It is a legend in its own right, I'm sure there are some good books about it and Wikipedia says people are still looking for it. The authors know where it is and they are telling you. It is all on page 400! However, my paperback edition (2010) only has 288 pages including the index. It's a wonderfully hidden joke that I did not see mentioned in any other review. I guess we'll have to wait another 10,000 years for the ""20,000 Year Explosion"" followup edition that will explain how humans have evolved since the demise of print books, audio CDs, broadcast television, sidewalks and other signs of civilization. Hopefully this newer edition will have a page 400.To me this was a fascinating read. ""Explosion"" discusses human genetics and evolution, a subject that I have found interesting for a long time but have not actually had the patience to really delve into in order to get a comprehensive basis for true knowledge--I feel that it would take a little more time than I want to dedicate to find out more about organic chemistry and processes of how organic molecules act and react with other to make up DNA mechanisms, and how that affects how life works etc. I did tackle ""The Eight Day of Creation"" some decades ago...what I read of it was fascinating but then life's personal activities got in the way. But the thing that really stopped me was that I kept the used copy (It cost only 1 dollar) of the book I bought on a back shelf for about 10 years and then when I finally started reading it and got a little more than half way through--it is an 800 page monster--I realized that it was mis-bound and many pages were duplicated but also very mixed up and completely out of order. More importantly, a lot was missing overall and the local library didn't have a copy that that could be loaned out to read. I was not going to sit in the library and work my way through it. So basically, that's now where I left my knowledge of genes and DNA and alleles and the mechanics of genetics.That said, I did appreciate the simplification in general that the authors made to get their point across. That point is that we are still evolving, our physiology is still reacting to the environment around us trying to adapt us in the best way possible to allow for species survival and thriving. It's a good read and will get me to read more about this subject. Parts of their theses reminded me of Julian Jaynes' book with that wonderful title--""The Development of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind"" and his theory that we humans finally realized that it wasn't the Gods talking to each and every one of us, it was just our brains finally melding messages together across the corpus callosum inside each of our skulls."
208,0465002218,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1219617-erik,3,"Cochran and Harpending dispel the long-held scientific notion that human evolution reached a plateau tens of thousands of years ago, as well as all change has been cultural. Instead, they argue that cultural change has effected genetic change, and vice versa. Not only did agriculture select for certain characteristics – like lactose tolerance as a result of animal husbandry, for one – but so introgression with Neanderthals, which has been historically frowned upon in the scientific community due to biased in favor of the notion homo sapiens purity. ""The explosion is ongoing: Human evolution didn’t stop when anatomically modern humans appeared, or when they expanded out of Africa. It never stopped – and why would it? Evolutionary stasis requires a static environment, whereas behavioral modernity is all about innovation and change. Stability is exactly what we have not had. This should be obvious, but instead the human sciences have labored under the strange idea that evolution stopped 40,000 years ago.""One of their most controversial notions is their well-supported argument that the Ashkenazi Jews of Eastern Europe have a genetic propensity for higher intelligence as a direct result of marriage only within their community combined with societal pressures against intermarriage with gentiles, strict limitations on what kinds of white-collars jobs they could hold (banking, finance, science), and the resulting economic rewards for succeeding economically (higher birth rate, better heated homes, more personal privacy in those homes that helped thwart contact with diseases fatal to the more impoverished, etc.). All of these combined set the conditions for natural selection that resulted in a better-educated and genetically-insular population with a slightly higher-than-average IQ when compared to the other European genetic groups that they lived alongside. Perhaps this is a stretch for the politically correct crowd, but it certainly is worthy of reasoned debate and consideration. (On the flip side, Cochran and Harpending are quick to remind us that the Ashkenazi Jews also have an accompanying genetic predisposition for various diseases that other groups do not have.)As an educator, I was particularly struck by their assertion that ""Nongenetic factors also influence IQ, but for the most part, the ones that matter are not the ones people thought would matter. Prenatal care, breastfeeding, nutrition, access to early education, Mozart in the womb, and oat bran all have little or no effect. Surprisingly, the way in which a family raised children seems to have no effect on adult IQ.""Alas, neither Cochran nor Harpending go on to detail just what nongenetic factors can or do influence IQ. (I would argue that the quality of formal education be one.)On a style note, I admit to wishing several times for either Richard Dawkins or Jared Diamond’s more persuasive and personable narrative styles. (No surprise, Diamond’s Guns, Germs, and Steel and The Third Chimpanzee are both quoted numerous times.) Of course, knowing that this is the first book between the Cochran and Harpending, I imagine that they will both improve in this area in future books the co-write. "
209,0465002218,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4975079-daniel-hammer,4,"This is just the kind of exciting, accessible and provocative science that I like to read about. For the most part. Cochran and Harpending's book presents the argument that human evolution has increased in pace over the last 10,000 years. This is in contrast to a more standard view which argues that, due to the ability to culturally and technologically reshape our environment, modern human beings have less of a need to evolve biologically in response to environmental pressures. He begins with a few basics of populations genetic which support the likelihood of an increased rate of evolution in recent times. Among these are the increase in human population numbers; more people equals more chances for mutations to develop. Also important is the fact that our diets have changed more in the past 10,000 years than had hominin diets for the previous several million years. This would have introduced significant dietary pressures on us, and those who could tolerate or process certain foods (such as lactose) would be more evolutionarily successful. 10,000 years ago is a key starting point because it corresponds with the advent of agriculture, which introduced larger populations, new diets, crowded living, and more.Cochran and Harpending survey a range or very interesting ideas. They argue that humans almost definitely bred with Neanderthals. That lactose tolerance was a key to the spread of Indo-European languages, via the adaptable, milk-drinking people which spoke those tongues. They examine a number of genetic mutations which are limited to certain populations and reflect recent genetic (evolutionary) responses to environment and diet, like sickle-cell trait. They suggest that light skin color may have evolved for more than just the ability to synthesize more vitamin D, and that the human brain likely underwent important structural changes just in the past 30,000 years.All of this is seriously interesting, and a pleasure to read and debate. The downside is that Cochran and Harpending are slim on evidence for much of this. I an inclined to believe they are largely correct, but too often the book reads like a laundry list of exciting suggestions, without much to back them up.This book certainly worth a quick read and makes some great food for thought."
210,0465002218,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19773041-joseph-hirsch,3,"Depending on a whole host of factors (your scientific background, religion, personal experiences, and biases, to name a few) one could come away from ""The 10,000 Year Explosion"" thinking that anthropologist Greg Cochran is an intellectually voracious man who wants to know where and how humans differ in their genes in order to cure diseases and increase social harmony, or conversely, that he is a latter-day Cesare Lombroso who wants to bust out the calipers to measure our heads to find out which of us have seed worth saving for his eugenic experiments and which of us need to undergo forced sterilization.Having read his ""10,000 Year Explosion"" written by Cochran in conjunction with geneticist Henry Harpending, I found the authors to be intelligent, humorous men capable of explaining very, very complicated concepts in a way that did not scare off this layman. The problem I had with the book was not some kind of moral objection (science doesn't care about my feelings) but rather the nagging sense that this was a paper or presentation stretched out to book length, and that any one of the ideas explicated in the book in one chapter would have made a great book in itself. Dr (?) Cochran cites Jared Diamond's ""Guns, Germs, and Steel"" multiple times throughout the book; I just wish he'd taken the same sort of ""deep dive"" approach to this book in terms of its structure and breadth. In brief (and it's hard to be brief with this information) Cochran argues that human evolution did not stop roughly 40,000 years ago as many believe, and that evolution is an ongoing process, and that this process can ""explode"" in a very local and idiosyncratic way, based on everything from rigorous man-made laws (especially regarding things like out-marriage) to civic arrangements (one of the more disturbing but fascinating detours in the book holds that once humans shifted from hunter-gatherers to agrarians, we started to favor the conforming and even servile over the independent and strong).Someone, in an attempt to summarize this book, called it something like an exploration of history through the lens of genetics, which would be a pretty good capitulation. The authors take the reader from ancient Asian Steppes where Mongol hordes perfected a simple but effective reproduction strategy (kill the men and mate with the women), all the way forward in time to an Israeli hospital in the twenty-first, where the idea that genetic advantages can become disadvantages or can even be made irrelevant is explored. As previously mentioned, all of the subjects dealt with are fascinating, and presented in a clear manner. But it's a bit too thumbnail for my taste. Your take might differ. I'd certainly take a class with Dr. Cochran, though, if I were still in college. I imagine it would be easy to stay awake during his seminars. "
211,0465002218,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32156837-mike,5,"This is a fascinating book on the mutual influence of genes on culture and of culture on genes. The ""explosion"" referred to in the title was the advent of agriculture, which greatly multiplied the size of the human population, greatly altered culture, and redirected human evolution down new paths to adapt to this new culture. When human population increased the rate of genetic mutations increased correspondingly, which increased the rate of evolution (by 100 fold according to the authors). Humans, especially those in densely populated areas, have been evolving rapidly in the last 10,000 years--and their evolution is driven by their environment, including their culture. But, then, newly evolved humans, being different from their ancestors, develop different cultural environments more suitable to their nature. Thus, evolution and human culture form a feedback loop. Of course, in a world of relatively isolated regional and local populations, their will be different natural/cultural environments, hence differential evolution to adapt to them. Inuit amidst ice flows and tundra would not (and did not) evolve the same way as Melanesians on their tropical islands. And evolution may proceed quite rapidly under certain circumstances, particularly large population size and major environmental impetus. On top of well supported scientific theory, the authors add numerous examples of evolution-culture interaction throughout history. It's an important new perspective on history. The style of writing is clear, needless academic jargon wisely jettisoned. The historical examples that run through the book seem somewhat arbitrarily chosen, but, this being a relatively new field of inquiry, the authors are probably just following the trail of such evidence as we currently have. The newness also means we face some uncertainties of interpretation. The authors note evidential limitations when present, but are bold to cast forth their nets in some clever speculations, one of which has been confirmed since publication (non-African humans have some Neanderthal DNA). This is what scientists do and are meant to do when faced with uncertainty: formulate hypotheses, preferably intelligent, informed ones. In this book, we have something of a hybrid beast: a populist approach with some vanguard hypothesizing. "
212,0465002218,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5466619-naftoli,5,"This book has opened my eyes to so many issues; to say that it is transformative is understatement. I had been taught in college that human evolution stopped with the advent of culture, that culture made adjustments to the environment thus eliminating the need for biology to fine tune our bodies. I had also been trained to view IQ tests as simply racist tools used by white patriarchal society to convince the priveleged that minority people are inferior - it sounds hyperbolic but I was actually told this by professors! I had also been taught that all humans are essentially the same (one world, one people, that race is only skin deep). When confronted with differences in intelligence, adaptability, etc. I was taught that this is due to political inequities, war, in short, culture. This book challenges these biases. I will no doubt read this book again at some later date and refer to it from time to time. I am not trained as a scientist so I will have to review and re-review the data from time to time. I was trained as a social scientist - cultural anthropology - so I am the target audience for this book. The issue regarding Neanderthals and what became of them is one of the first issues undertaken in this work; I found it to be both realistic and reasonable. The authors rely on population genetics, mathematics, extrapolations, &c in an effort to buttress their position that modern humans have inherited a small but important percentage of Neanderthal genetic material. It makes sense to me.Among so many things, I admire the authors for having the courage to challenge our current received wisdom. It seems to me that they have taken quite a risk in doing so as there is nothing 'politically correct' about this book. The authors even point to data that most writers shy away from as it may cast them in a negative light. Whatever the reason for shying away from data, it is vital that we humans look facts straight in the face and deal with the realities of our evolution, our cultural wisdom and ethnocentricities, and our impact upon this planet. At the minimum, debate these issues rather than labeling and dismissing them. This book tackles a few of these issues."
213,0465002218,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4534780-alina,5,"The old thinking is that, when cultural evolution took off, biological evolution stopped -- because instead of being shaped by our environment, we began shaping our environment to us. That idea always seemed reasonable to me, but this book has changed my mind. The authors contend that, on the contrary, evolution has sped up since the neolithic revolution. The social innovations associated with agriculture and civilization mean we have subjected ourselves to major new environmental pressures, and that has fueled rapid natural selection. Their idea is that cultural evolution interacts with biological evolution; the two drive each other. One of the book's points is that natural selection isn't as slow as is often believed, since altering just one gene or even one nucleotide can sometimes result in important advantages. By examining evidence from the exploding field of population genetics, as well as other sources, the authors find indications of significant biological change in the past 10,000 years or so. Examples include differing disease resistance in response to local conditions, the development of lactose tolerance in dairy farmers, and selection for higher intelligence among Ashkenazi Jews. Although I'd heard of some of these things before, I hadn't appreciated the impact on history. The authors make a convincing case that genetic factors can be decisive.

那么为何德系犹太人特别聪慧呢？想要解答这个谜题，或许我们可以看看关于阿什肯纳兹犹太人的DNA我们都知道些什么，因为事实证明它们还有另一个有趣的特征。即，它们有一组不常见的严重遗传病，例如家族性黑蒙性痴呆症、高雪氏病、家族性自主神经功能异常，以及两种不同形式的遗传性乳腺癌（BRCA1和BRCA2），这些疾病在阿什肯纳兹犹太人群体中的发病率比在其他欧洲人群中高将近100倍。我们相信这两个谜题有单一的解释。我们认为阿什肯纳兹犹太人在北欧逗留的时期在白领职业的自然选择中获得了成功，而这成功源自他们智力上的遗传优势。但对于智力的强势选择也产生了一些让人不愉快的副作用：提高遗传携带者智商的等位基因同时也对纯合体产生损害。这一类解释自然是有争议的。事实上很多人排斥这一类说法：智力是可测量的，由遗传决定的，不同的人类群体间有智力上的差异。有趣的是，这些批评和斥责甚少来自从事认知测试及其结果分析的科学工作者。业内对此很少或几乎没有任何争议，智商测试是准确的，测试结果能预测学术成就和个体生活的其他方面，而且智商值有极高的遗传率。如果遗传的确能影响智力，那么一段时间后，智力带来的繁殖优势必然会带来更高的智力。这个简单的逻辑是关于自然选择的演化理论的核心：能增加繁殖的基因在人类群体中会随时间推移变得越来越常见。.................我们认为印欧扩张起始于乳糖耐受突变的频率增高，当其频率增高至足以使整个人群转型从事制乳业经济的时候，印欧人就迅速扩散至整个南俄大草原。这迅速的扩张就有可能导致说近似语言的同一人群分散在从当今的乌克兰直到乌拉尔河地区这一广阔区域。因为扩张如此迅速，语言还没有分化，所以这一广大区域中分散的人群说的还是相似的语言。印欧人前进的步伐持续至进入欧洲，在那里制乳业在生态学效应上足以跟早期农业竞争，而且前者催生了一种远远更具侵略性的文化。印欧文化很可能是更好战的，因为印欧人群的高机动性、更多的人口数量和更好的营养使他们能比其他人群更经常赢得战争。而他们的胜利反过来又会提升他们的军事行动效率，从而成功哺育了更多成功。从印欧人基因在欧洲基因库占的相对低的比例来看，他们似乎实行的是精英统治，做被征服人群的统治者但没有摧毁或替代原先的居住者。然而相对小的精英人口常常能够让所有其余人口说他们的语言。此外，印欧人还把乳糖耐受的等位基因加进了本地的混合基因库。乳糖耐受突变在印欧人入侵前的欧洲很罕见或根本不存在，然而当制乳业受自然选择青睐的时候，它就在欧洲变得很常见了，特别是在北欧。[20]印欧语言和文化在制乳业流行的地域传播扩散，比方说，它们还进入了南欧和伊朗，然而中东的强势国家们似乎阻止了这些语言文化进入中东。我们认为印欧扩张起始于乳糖耐受突变的频率增高，当其频率增高至足以使整个人群转型从事制乳业经济的时候，印欧人就迅速扩散至整个南俄大草原。这迅速的扩张就有可能导致说近似语言的同一人群分散在从当今的乌克兰直到乌拉尔河地区这一广阔区域。因为扩张如此迅速，语言还没有分化，所以这一广大区域中分散的人群说的还是相似的语言。印欧人前进的步伐持续至进入欧洲，在那里制乳业在生态学效应上足以跟早期农业竞争，而且前者催生了一种远远更具侵略性的文化。印欧文化很可能是更好战的，因为印欧人群的高机动性、更多的人口数量和更好的营养使他们能比其他人群更经常赢得战争。而他们的胜利反过来又会提升他们的军事行动效率，从而成功哺育了更多成功。从印欧人基因在欧洲基因库占的相对低的比例来看，他们似乎实行的是精英统治，做被征服人群的统治者但没有摧毁或替代原先的居住者。然而相对小的精英人口常常能够让所有其余人口说他们的语言。此外，印欧人还把乳糖耐受的等位基因加进了本地的混合基因库。乳糖耐受突变在印欧人入侵前的欧洲很罕见或根本不存在，然而当制乳业受自然选择青睐的时候，它就在欧洲变得很常见了，特别是在北欧。[20]印欧语言和文化在制乳业流行的地域传播扩散，比方说，它们还进入了南欧和伊朗，然而中东的强势国家们似乎阻止了这些语言文化进入中东。.......一开始他们是作为基督教与穆斯林世界的中介的国际商人。然而随着穆斯林和基督徒（特别是意大利人）逐渐开始直接通商，阿什肯纳兹犹太商人越来越多地开始从事本地贸易。当对犹太人的迫害越来越严重从而长距离旅行无法得到安全保障之后，德系犹太人越来越专注于金融业，这个行业对他们是敞开的，因为基督徒被禁止放高利贷。在公元1100年前绝大部分德系犹太人都是放贷者，这一模式延续了几个世纪。[15]这些职业（交易和金融业）有很高的智商需求，我们可以肯定没有其他人类群体有这么高数量比例的人口在长时段内从事需要很高认知能力的职业。有时我们能找到相当详尽的阿什肯纳兹犹太人的商业活动记录。比如关于南法鲁西永犹太人在约公元1270年就有这样的记录：“有全面证据证明这群犹太人以放贷为生，实质上完全没有从事任何其他种类的经济活动。有记录的228名男性犹太人中近八成在向他们的基督教邻居放贷。犹太女人（几乎都是寡妇）放贷的也很常见，这些来自弱势者的资本被投资到相似的渠道。并且最积极从事放贷的犹太人似乎在他们的群体内是最受尊崇的。................他们曾是波兰立陶宛王国的管理者阶层。除了读写能力之外，在这些特定职业上取得成功所依靠的是类似于现今商人的素质，至少也需要有追踪复杂交易和资金流动的能力。最终，随着波兰立陶宛王国的阿什肯纳兹犹太人人口数量上升，越来越多的犹太人成了手工艺者——毕竟对管理和金融职业的需求也是有一定限度的。然而在800到900年的时间段内，也就是大致从公元800年到公元1650或1700年，绝大部分的阿什肯纳兹犹太人从事的是管理和金融业，也就是复杂度很高的职业，他们几乎从来不当农民和匠人。在这个方面他们和所有其他定居人口都有所不同。事实上，在那个时代任何占有领地的人类族群都不可能有那么高比例的人口从事白领职业，因为这样农业生产率就会过低。九成的人口都必须务农，从而生产足够的粮食去养活他们自己和社会顶层少量的统治者、文员、士兵、匠人以及商人。对白领职业的自然选择只有在这一阶层独自成为一个族群的时候才有可能成功，这一族群必须靠职业而非其据地而界定。在高复杂度职业中取得成功的犹太人享有更高的遗传优势。学者怀里波说：“在富裕的家庭中有更多的孩子能活到成年。总体上属于更富裕阶层的许多商业领袖、显赫拉比、群体领袖和类似个体的谱系显示，这些人通常有4个、6个甚至8～9个孩子活到成年。........智商有很高的可遗传性。这意味着一个个体的智商值会部分取决于遗传影响，从而更接近他或她的父母和兄弟姐妹而不是随便哪个别人。同一对父母生下的子女即便在不同环境下养大也会有相近的智商值，而领养的兄弟姐妹即便在同一屋檐下长大也不会有相近的智商值。高度也是类似的：长得高的人更可能有高于平均身高的子女。事实上，成年人的智商值与身高一样主要受遗传因素影响。然而童年的智商值却受遗传影响更少，而更容易受周围环境影响。周围环境对儿童智商测试结果的影响会在青春期期间或其后消失，这成了美国先锋计划（Head Start Program）的基础，即宣扬智商值能因一定干预而提高。非遗传因素同样会影响智商值，但很多情况下那些起作用的因素都不是人们想象会起作用的因素。父母关爱、母乳喂养、营养情况、早教、子宫中听莫扎特音乐和燕麦麸几乎都没起什么作用。而让人惊讶的是，一个家庭养育孩子的方式看起来对孩子成年时的智商值没有任何影响。这有效地反驳了一些流行的环境决定论——它们对阿什肯纳兹犹太人的高智商做各种成长环境方面的解释，尤其反驳了那些认为犹太母亲用特殊的方式抚养孩子催发了他们的高智商的论调。...在阿什肯纳兹犹太人特别高发的遗传病中，广为人知的是家族性黑蒙性痴呆症、高雪氏病和BRCA1与BRCA2乳腺癌突变，但同时还有许多其他的疾病，比如尼曼匹克症、卡纳万病和家族性自主神经功能异常。有些会引起神经方面的问题。它们在阿什肯纳兹犹太人身上特别高发，这已经成了人类遗传学上一个长久的谜题。.....是什么样的性征在阿什肯纳兹犹太人身上比在他们的邻居身上更宝贵呢？嗯，我们有一些很强的线索。是什么性征在当今的德系犹太人身上最突出呢？他们是壮大如萨摩亚人，高如图西族人，以及牛奶耐受如荷兰人吗？不是的，他们的特殊性征就是智力。这些突变体本身就提示了这一点：它们中的一些看起来就很像会提高智商的，考虑到它们作用于中枢神经系统的发展。鞘脂类突变体特别有可能具有提升智力的作用。在每一种这类突变体中，都有一些特定鞘脂累积；这些鞘脂是变更过的脂类分子，它们在信号传输中起作用，并在神经组织中特别常见。研究者已经确定这些鞘脂类作用水平的提升会引致神经元（中枢神经系统的基本细胞）之间更多的连接（高雪氏病的轴突生长）。在家族性黑蒙性痴呆症的情形中有相似的效应：特定的累积混合物（GM2神经节苷脂）作用水平提升会促进树突（连接神经元的纤细多分支突起）的增长。[41]这种树突生成的增加现象也同样发生在A型尼曼匹克细胞出现、动物版黑蒙性痴呆症和尼曼匹克病的情形下。这些都是已知的疾病等位基因中唯一能引致神经连接增加的因素。我们同时还有（并不确凿的）证据证明德系犹太人身上常见的一些基因变异有可能提升智力。我们研究了耶路撒冷高雪氏病患者的职业——实际上是所有在耶路撒冷沙尔泽德克医学中心（Shaare Zedek Medical Centre）治疗的患者。这些患者成为工程师或科学家的概率比以色列阿什肯纳兹犹太人从事这些职业的平均概率要高很多，事实上大概要高11倍。[42]关于阿什肯纳兹犹太人的另一种遗传病扭转性肌张力障碍也有类似的研究结果。这种遗传病最初被诊断出来的时候，研究者就已经开始注意到其患者不同寻常的智力水平。.....结论文化革新在很长的时间里都是人类生物学变化的驱动力，在约250万年前人类开始使用工具之后就一直如此。自然选择青睐那些从事早期文化革新的原始人类大脑，而这些革新本身就导向更多身体和心理上的变化。生物学特征和文化特征的协同演化一开始是很缓慢的，至少以现代标准看是慢的，但渐渐演化速度就快起来了。考古学记录显示我们的革新能力持续上升，直至约4万年前，我们已经为所谓的“人类革命”或旧石器时代晚期欧洲和亚洲北部的“创造性大爆发”蓄势待发。技术和艺术的突然兴盛发生在人类扩张并走出非洲的不久以后；它同时也跟生物学变化有关，而我们猜想这些生物学变化部分是由从尼安德特人或其他远古人类（亚洲大陆更早的占据者）身上偷得的基因驱动的。行为现代化导致更多的变化：人类制作更精良的工具，然后他们在数代人的时间里也反过来被这些工具不断塑造变化。农业出现之后，文化和生物演化都加速了，因为新的生活方式使人们有了新的需求。农业出现以前人类一直都是觅食者：农业带来的人口急剧增加使得更多有益的变异体出现，也使得更多新想法出现。我们人类在农业传播后的快速演化的确是一万年的爆发。 这爆发如今还在持续：人类演化并没有止步于解剖学意义上的现代人类出现，或他们扩张走出非洲的时候。它从来没有停止。而且它怎么会停下呢？演化停滞需要一个静滞的环境，而行为现代化一直带来的都是革新和变化。一直以来我们都不曾有稳定和静滞的环境。这一点应该是很明显的，然而人类科学不仅忽视了它，相反还一直在一个奇怪的前提下辛勤地做研究，这个奇怪的想法认为演化在4万年前就停止了。 所有这些都意味着也必然意味着，生物变化是驱动历史的重要因素。当然它不是唯一的因素，而且很奇怪的是，它还被与更传统的影响绑定在一起。诸如乳糖耐受一类的遗传变化的出现和传播是文化革新（例如农业的发展）的结果，它同时也源自随机出现的合适的突变。这些遗传变化反过来也对文化产生了影响。印欧人的扩张，欧洲人在北美和澳大利亚的成功定居，“瓜分非洲”的失败，阿什肯纳兹犹太人进入智力舞台，甚至有可能工业革命和科学的兴起，所有这些看来都是生物和文化变化之永恒的舞步所营造的。 如果人类科学的研究者们继续忽略自然选择从未停止作用这一事实，他们就会把许多重要问题的解答线索给丢掉，把谜题变成秘密。科尔特斯带着500人就征服并控制了几百万人的帝国。想要解释这件事情而不提持续演化带来的疾病抵御机制中的生物学差异，这完全不可能。公元前5世纪的修昔底德说人类特征是不会变化的，所以可以预测，而当今许多科学家相信人类特征几万年前就停止了改变。历史学家们似乎一直以此为研究的前提。然而这样一来他们就忽略了巨大的契机，不仅在于解读人类的往昔，而且也在于塑造未来。贯穿人类历史的持续演化一直是一个巨大的自然界的实验，这个实验承诺了我们在理解自身、抵御疾病和精神病症方面的巨大的成果。利莫内苏尔加尔达隐藏着关于人类疾病的一个重要线索。世界上大概有100万个这样的小村庄，一定有更多类似的线索等待我们去发现。人类历史为我们展现的一些实验的成果甚至有可能帮助我们进行更有野心的尝试，去增加人类寿命和认知能力。从事人类科学的学者们是时候去甩掉一系列关于演化停止和“心理均一”的僵化教条了。每一刻时间都很宝贵，我们有一整个世界要去争取呢。"
215,0465002218,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16831597-fran-globlek,4,"The authors manage to spoil many thought-provoking observations with a careless approach to logic and underwhelming scientific rigour. I will give it 4/5 on account of me enjoying the ideas. These ideas, however, convince me to the extent of them ""making sense"". As a scientist I do expect much more in order to be convinced. I understand that this would make the book significantly longer and it might not necessarily be aimed for the ""general public"", but I would argue that here we don't really see the case of oversimplification being the issue, since the ideas, terminology, methodology described etc. are not necessarily ""dumbed down"". Instead, there is a certain haughty attitude - judging by this book alone, everybody other than the authors thinks genetic changes in human beings stopped 40,000 years ago and is wholly dogmatic. "
216,0465002218,http://goodreads.com/user/show/77887124-paul-clark,1,"This book rejects the view that race is primarily a social construct and proposes five hypotheses about genetic differences between ethnic groups. The first two, lactose tolerance and resistance to pathogens, are physiological and uncontroversial. The same cannot be said of the other three: that interbreeding between Eurasians and Neanderthals increased Eurasian intelligence, that long-term exposure to agriculture leads to a greater predisposition to the ‘bourgeois’ values of hard work and restraint, and that medieval restrictions on Ashkenazi Jews raised their intelligence. This review will focus on these three hypotheses.THE NEANDERTHAL ADVANTAGEHomo sapiens first encountered Neanderthals after leaving Africa 40,000 years ago. Cochran and Harpending speculate that interbreeding between the two species raised Eurasian intelligence, triggering the Upper Palaeolithic revolution in technology, symbolic behaviour and socio-economic organisation. Quite how sub-Saharan Africans later managed the same transition to modern behaviour without the benefit of Neanderthal DNA, the authors do not say.In any case, many archaeologists favour non-genetic explanations for the transition. Others argue that it occurred in Africa much earlier, citing discoveries like a large 70,000 year-old settlement in Sudan and sophisticated 44,000 year-old southern African artefacts. If critics of the Upper Palaeolithic model turn out to be correct, Cochran and Harpending’s highly speculative hypothesis would be falsified.THE AGRICULTURAL REVOLUTION AND BOURGEOIS VALUESThe authors claim that the development of agriculture led to the spread of genes for hard work and restraint among those populations in the Middle East, East Asia and Europe that have been exposed to agriculture for longest.Whilst superficially convincing, their account has serious flaws. The most glaring is the claim that ADHD has been bred out of China, where it actually affects up to 5% of schoolchildren. Other claims presented as facts are in reality matters of dispute. Agriculture might have arisen in sub-Saharan Africa 1,000 years earlier than the authors state, and their claim that Australian Aborigines never developed agriculture is contested.In most pre-capitalist societies, hard work did not have the significance the authors give it because any attempt to rise above your station was seen as sinful and peasants generally did as little work as they could get away with. The way people accumulated wealth was to squeeze it out of someone else as a warlord, a landlord or the holder of a sinecure that enabled them to milk others.Traders who acquired wealth through hard work dreamed of turning it into land, finding an impoverished noble family to marry into and putting their feet up. The only ones unable to do this were religious minorities like Armenians, Jews, Lebanese and Parsees. Cochran and Harpending claim that bourgeois genes made these communities successful middlemen when in fact it was their minority religion that trapped them in this niche.Similarly dubious is the claim that a lack of bourgeois genes fuels opposition to neo-liberalism in Latin America. Surely the growth of the industrial working class is a better explanation for the influence of socialism there.The authors contrast farmers who refrain from eating their seed corn with hunter gatherers who scupper efforts to turn them into herders by eating all their goats. But are hunter gatherers really so stupid? Or is this a case of a top-down innovation deliberately sabotaged by a community that never wanted it?The claim that aggression has been bred out of those populations longest exposed to agriculture is undermined by Cohen and Nisbett’s famous study that found startling differences in levels of aggression between genetically indistinguishable people from different cultures.THE INTELLIGENCE OF AHKANAZI JEWSCochran and Harpending’s third controversial hypothesis concerns the high IQs of Ashkenazi Jews, allegedly 12-15 points above other Europeans. They favour the theory that this is genetically determined because medieval north European Jews were restricted to white-collar occupations, particularly money lending, in which only intelligent people could succeed, giving them greater reproductive success in a community where marrying out was forbidden.However, the data they present is superficial. The influence of heritability on IQ shifts during a person’s life, rising dramatically as children grow to adulthood. But the authors never give the ages of the people in their statistics, making them impossible to assess.Their claim that 80% of economically active medieval Ashkenazim were full-time moneylenders is unconvincing, since Jews were confined to ghettoes with separate micro-economies, and rules forbidding the ‘improper subordination’ of Christians by Jews would probably have created the need for a Jewish servant class.Despite these caveats, this hypothesis is credible if unproven. There is no a priori reason why the heritable intelligence of every ethnic group should be the same and the Ashkenazim are a genetically closed community with a unique history.CONCLUSIONSThe 10,000 Year Explosion makes noteworthy points about physiological differences between the races and asks an interesting question about the intelligence of Ashkenazi Jews without quite supplying the answer. But it has conspicuously failed to demonstrate any other link between race and either intelligence or character. Cochran and Harpending’s Neanderthal hypothesis is highly speculative, and their claims about bourgeois values and agriculture rest on questionable evidence and a willingness to ignore simpler and more obvious explanations.Please see my website for a longer and fully sourced version of this review."
217,0465002218,http://goodreads.com/user/show/84499280-david-baer,4,"I got worried reading the introduction, because (among many others) they thanked Phil Rushton, who I remember from a lifetime ago as being in the news in a bad way, as in using his research to either promote or implicitly support racist ideologies. But I continued anyway, because I find the subject matter fascinating.Because, as I opined in my review of Before the Dawn: Recovering the Lost History of Our Ancestors, it's not by definition racist to inquire into the genetic basis of racial variation - it's only racist if you use such inquiry to justify privilege for one group, or even to consider one group as inherently superior to another. So, for example, it's not racist to find the genetic basis for why Kenyans are so successful at long-distance running. It is racist to conclude from that fact, that, I don't know, say, ""driving while black"" isn't really a thing. Or that separation of the ""races"" is a good thing, etc etc.This book isn't racist, in my opinion - but I understand how it could come off as such. The thing about Ashkenazi Jews having enhanced intelligence has a certain taint to it, because it's been used to justify (racist) hierarchies of the ""races"". And this thing about the Ashkenazi Jews comes up again and again: because they experienced unique conditions of repression in northern Europe for a thousand years, those who could really be successful in intellectually challenging roles such as (principally) money-lending, were more reproductively successful. So there is a lot of evidence presented, and I buy it, and I don't believe I am racist for buying it, but still - there are a lot of racists who also buy it, and that makes me a bit uncomfortable.Even though the book has a lot of footnotes and a good bibliography, I felt the authors did a poor job of constructing arguments. It seemed they were all over the place, all the time - promising answers and then discursively wandering away from what they promised to answer, never getting back to it. Like on page 91 we are told ""we now understand quite a bit about the genetic changes that led to light skin in northern Eurasians."" Wow! That's a big statement; I was prepared for a big explanation. But a dozen pages of stuff later, they were moving on to another topic; I carefully re-read the intervening pages, which were all quite interesting, but I confirmed that they definitely never delivered on their promised explanation of skin color.I give it 4 stars because I love the subject matter and am fascinated by the implications of the fact that all modern people emerged from a small African population of humans who lived about 50kya. Our written history is so microscopic compared to all of what must have happened - just to know what we can infer from genetics to fill in the blanks is amazing. Unfortunately racists will also find much to love in this book; I can't help that and it's not the fault of the authors either."
218,0465002218,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50953703-groot,5,"The rate of human evolution has accelerated radically over the last 10,000 years. This takes a genetic perspective on history and archaeology, benefiting from the vast improvement in the science and technology of genomic knowledge. Organisms, including people, adapt to changing environments, and our environment is changing radically, starting with the Upper Paleolithic, the introduction of farming, settling into towns, domesticating animals (including milk-yielding species), the vast increase in the number of humans and consequent breeding ground for infectious diseases, literacy and numeracy and their contribution to human prospering for those that could excel at them, and so on. A fascinating book, with some safe and interesting insights, but not shying away from more controversial hypotheses, such as the contributions of proto-humans, such as Neanderthals and Denisovans, to modern humans, with their longer-term adaptations to living in northern climes, possibly contributing lighter skin and other features."
219,0465002218,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40298632-joe-q,4,"This book cogently argues that, rather than ending with the dawn of modern Homo sapiens, evolution has been continuing apace over the last 10,000 years. Arguments from natural selection are used to explain patterns in world history, including Europeans' success in displacing Amerindians in the Americas and their failure to displace Africans in the tropical parts of that continent. It's a quick read, and very enlightening.While the authors make their case very clearly, I would have liked to see them explore whether modern medical science -- or demographics in general -- has weakened the link between ""reproductive fitness"" and actual numbers of descendants. Given that so much infectious disease can be treated or controlled, quality food and good sanitation are abundant, and many very ""reproductively fit"" people choose to have small families (or none at all), does their thesis still apply? Will the next 10,000 years be like the last 10,000 were?"
220,0465002218,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70611546-kevin,2,"According to this book, conventional evolutionary psychology claims that we became adapted to the savannah after spending hundreds of thousands of years other. The tens of thousands of years since we left Africa were not enough for evolution to do anything more than tweak us around the edges and the time since the agricultural revolution is a mere blink of an evolutionary eye and human evolution has more or less slowed to a crawl.The 10,000 Year Explosion is evolutionary psychology dialed up to 11. Rather than slowing down, evolution has actually sped up. Genetic change was responsible not just for the agricultural revolution but the scientific and industrial revolutions too, not to mention the rise and fall of empires. Examples of candidate mutations abound. The sum of the books arguments, though was unconvincing. "

With a firm root in evolutionary theory, Cochran and Harpending convinces anyone who isn't blind or an absolute idiot about the impossibility of evolutionary pressures on humans halting to a stop. The authors lays out evolutionary thinking in such a way that the reader will by the end of the book feel a lot more confident in her understanding of the world. It should truly be read by everyone.The book can be read by anyone without any prior knowledge on evolutionary theory. The minimum level of the book is high-school. This due to the authors' superior skill in laying out and explaining every phenomenon in the most simple manner. "

The concept of a variant on 'artificial selection' as is observed for dogs and other domesticated animals and plants, seems suggested although not explicit. This seems based on advantages for particular populations, with more offspring among those with particular genetic traits and cultural adaptations such as herding, farming, urbanization, domestic animals such as horses, and improved military weaponry. Pretty persuasive that the process seems ongoing."

Then the modern human out of africa confonrting Neaderteals is also interesting. Then I brought the book with me on my trips to Chengdu with parents and reading became on and off and hard to concentrate. So the middle part of the book is a bit lost to me. Then I returned home and read the last chapter about why a branch of Jews (German Jews) are super smart while bearing more genetic diseases really really interesting and I learned a lot. This last chapter alone make the book deserve a 5 star.

236,0465002218,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12991284-jeremy,3,"As a long time reader of science books I was immediately attracted to this book due to its great title – titles are important, take note publishers. The last science book I read was the great The Fifth Miracle by Paul Davies, which was an examination of how life evolved. Cochran and Harpending’s book promised an argument against the long held theory that humans stopped evolving fifty thousand years ago, just after emerging out of Africa. The book describes itself as the “…the latest edition to the fast emerging discipline of biohistory.” There’s been quite a bit of news related to this area lately, so I thought that it was time to give it a read.The book opens with a refutation of “conventional wisdom”, with the authors claiming that human evolution has accelerated in the last ten thousand years due to various selection pressures, such as agriculture, geographic expansion and climate change. They go on to examine the period that started fifty to forty thousand years ago when modern humans moved into the European territories of the Neanderthal. Ten thousand years later the Neanderthal were extinct and humans were flourishing. No one knows for sure but it seems that humans displayed better adaptations such as advanced language, tools and hunting techniques. There is convincing genetic evidence that we interbreed with Neanderthals and picked up and kept various advantageous genes – just ask Ozzy Osbourne. The ensuing four chapters examine the impact of the advent of agriculture some ten thousand years ago and how the changes to what we ate affected our genetic makeup; the genetic flow of humanity as expressed by selective sweeps of particular genes and also the impact of expansion on humans throughout the globe. A succinct summary - but if you want to know the facts then read the book! But is it worth reading?The ideas presented in The 10,000 Year Explosion are certainly well argued. The authors blend history, archaeology, paleontology and biology to weave their arguments convincingly. They refer to their work as “genetic history” – a “new kind of history.” This is all very well but unfortunately the flaw of this book is that the writing style is relatively bland. There is an effort to engage and give the facts some personality, but as interested as I was in the arguments presented I often found myself bored. I believe that writing popular science is a tricky thing, because, after all, you don’t want to dumb it down; but also you don’t want to put the average reader off either. After reading this book I appreciate science writers such as Paul Davies and Marcus Chown for their efforts to both explain and engage.The 10,000 Year Explosion ends with a case study of the Ashkenazi Jews – Jews that were confined to Europe from medieval times and that were restricted to money lending and clerical professions; the kind of jobs that required a certain level of intelligence. The combination of the demands of their profession and their tendency to marry within their faith meant that the European Jews were selected for a higher intelligence than Jews in the Middle East. Five hundred or so years later descendants of this group were making the major scientific breakthroughs throughout many disciplines and they also displayed higher IQs than other groups. A fascinating case study, but once again the bland writing created a nagging sense of boredom.The story of human evolution is an amazing tale to behold - one that’s obsessed me on and off for years. It’s compelling, fascinating and most of all it’s our story. Unfortunately this book does not really capture the sense of wonder that our story can engender, which is a shame. Read this book if you want the facts, but perhaps look elsewhere if you want to feel that elusive sense of wonder. Although I was slightly disappointed overall, the one interesting thing this book did do for me was to make me ponder just how our present point in human evolutionary history will be viewed in five hundred years; and that’s not such a bad thing."
237,0465002218,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17431775-schwarzenberger,3,"Considering the subject matter, it is a light read with a lot of little tidbits thrown in about how many relatives Genghis Khan has that are still living across central Asia, how disease really helped Pizarro and only 168 soldiers tear apart the Inca Empire, where blue eyes originated, and other such scientific matters that make great dinner conversation and cocktail party opening lines.By the way, i like the cover with the almost stroboscopic depiction of evolutionary influenced skeletal uprightness and locomotion. It is a grabber of a design that gets your eye from across the floor of the library or bookshop.The authors may not like this, but I am giving away a highly kept secret they mention in the index--Yes I actually do read indices, to me they give a sense of the real core of a book and let you know what the authors think is really important. If you have limited time perusing the index gets you right to the action. Well, in the index there is an entry--Lost Dutchman Mine, location, 400. I guess this means that one or both of the authors knows where this reputedly amazingly rich gold mine is hidden. It is a legend in its own right, I'm sure there are some good books about it and Wikipedia says people are still looking for it. The authors know where it is and they are telling you. It is all on page 400! However, my paperback edition (2010) only has 288 pages including the index. It's a wonderfully hidden joke that I did not see mentioned in any other review. I guess we'll have to wait another 10,000 years for the ""20,000 Year Explosion"" followup edition that will explain how humans have evolved since the demise of print books, audio CDs, broadcast television, sidewalks and other signs of civilization. Hopefully this newer edition will have a page 400.To me this was a fascinating read. ""Explosion"" discusses human genetics and evolution, a subject that I have found interesting for a long time but have not actually had the patience to really delve into in order to get a comprehensive basis for true knowledge--I feel that it would take a little more time than I want to dedicate to find out more about organic chemistry and processes of how organic molecules act and react with other to make up DNA mechanisms, and how that affects how life works etc. I did tackle ""The Eight Day of Creation"" some decades ago...what I read of it was fascinating but then life's personal activities got in the way. But the thing that really stopped me was that I kept the used copy (It cost only 1 dollar) of the book I bought on a back shelf for about 10 years and then when I finally started reading it and got a little more than half way through--it is an 800 page monster--I realized that it was mis-bound and many pages were duplicated but also very mixed up and completely out of order. More importantly, a lot was missing overall and the local library didn't have a copy that that could be loaned out to read. I was not going to sit in the library and work my way through it. So basically, that's now where I left my knowledge of genes and DNA and alleles and the mechanics of genetics.That said, I did appreciate the simplification in general that the authors made to get their point across. That point is that we are still evolving, our physiology is still reacting to the environment around us trying to adapt us in the best way possible to allow for species survival and thriving. It's a good read and will get me to read more about this subject. Parts of their theses reminded me of Julian Jaynes' book with that wonderful title--""The Development of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind"" and his theory that we humans finally realized that it wasn't the Gods talking to each and every one of us, it was just our brains finally melding messages together across the corpus callosum inside each of our skulls."
238,0465002218,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1219617-erik,3,"Cochran and Harpending dispel the long-held scientific notion that human evolution reached a plateau tens of thousands of years ago, as well as all change has been cultural. Instead, they argue that cultural change has effected genetic change, and vice versa. Not only did agriculture select for certain characteristics – like lactose tolerance as a result of animal husbandry, for one – but so introgression with Neanderthals, which has been historically frowned upon in the scientific community due to biased in favor of the notion homo sapiens purity. ""The explosion is ongoing: Human evolution didn’t stop when anatomically modern humans appeared, or when they expanded out of Africa. It never stopped – and why would it? Evolutionary stasis requires a static environment, whereas behavioral modernity is all about innovation and change. Stability is exactly what we have not had. This should be obvious, but instead the human sciences have labored under the strange idea that evolution stopped 40,000 years ago.""One of their most controversial notions is their well-supported argument that the Ashkenazi Jews of Eastern Europe have a genetic propensity for higher intelligence as a direct result of marriage only within their community combined with societal pressures against intermarriage with gentiles, strict limitations on what kinds of white-collars jobs they could hold (banking, finance, science), and the resulting economic rewards for succeeding economically (higher birth rate, better heated homes, more personal privacy in those homes that helped thwart contact with diseases fatal to the more impoverished, etc.). All of these combined set the conditions for natural selection that resulted in a better-educated and genetically-insular population with a slightly higher-than-average IQ when compared to the other European genetic groups that they lived alongside. Perhaps this is a stretch for the politically correct crowd, but it certainly is worthy of reasoned debate and consideration. (On the flip side, Cochran and Harpending are quick to remind us that the Ashkenazi Jews also have an accompanying genetic predisposition for various diseases that other groups do not have.)As an educator, I was particularly struck by their assertion that ""Nongenetic factors also influence IQ, but for the most part, the ones that matter are not the ones people thought would matter. Prenatal care, breastfeeding, nutrition, access to early education, Mozart in the womb, and oat bran all have little or no effect. Surprisingly, the way in which a family raised children seems to have no effect on adult IQ.""Alas, neither Cochran nor Harpending go on to detail just what nongenetic factors can or do influence IQ. (I would argue that the quality of formal education be one.)On a style note, I admit to wishing several times for either Richard Dawkins or Jared Diamond’s more persuasive and personable narrative styles. (No surprise, Diamond’s Guns, Germs, and Steel and The Third Chimpanzee are both quoted numerous times.) Of course, knowing that this is the first book between the Cochran and Harpending, I imagine that they will both improve in this area in future books the co-write. "
239,0465002218,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4975079-daniel-hammer,4,"This is just the kind of exciting, accessible and provocative science that I like to read about. For the most part. Cochran and Harpending's book presents the argument that human evolution has increased in pace over the last 10,000 years. This is in contrast to a more standard view which argues that, due to the ability to culturally and technologically reshape our environment, modern human beings have less of a need to evolve biologically in response to environmental pressures. He begins with a few basics of populations genetic which support the likelihood of an increased rate of evolution in recent times. Among these are the increase in human population numbers; more people equals more chances for mutations to develop. Also important is the fact that our diets have changed more in the past 10,000 years than had hominin diets for the previous several million years. This would have introduced significant dietary pressures on us, and those who could tolerate or process certain foods (such as lactose) would be more evolutionarily successful. 10,000 years ago is a key starting point because it corresponds with the advent of agriculture, which introduced larger populations, new diets, crowded living, and more.Cochran and Harpending survey a range or very interesting ideas. They argue that humans almost definitely bred with Neanderthals. That lactose tolerance was a key to the spread of Indo-European languages, via the adaptable, milk-drinking people which spoke those tongues. They examine a number of genetic mutations which are limited to certain populations and reflect recent genetic (evolutionary) responses to environment and diet, like sickle-cell trait. They suggest that light skin color may have evolved for more than just the ability to synthesize more vitamin D, and that the human brain likely underwent important structural changes just in the past 30,000 years.All of this is seriously interesting, and a pleasure to read and debate. The downside is that Cochran and Harpending are slim on evidence for much of this. I an inclined to believe they are largely correct, but too often the book reads like a laundry list of exciting suggestions, without much to back them up.This book certainly worth a quick read and makes some great food for thought."
240,0465002218,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19773041-joseph-hirsch,3,"Depending on a whole host of factors (your scientific background, religion, personal experiences, and biases, to name a few) one could come away from ""The 10,000 Year Explosion"" thinking that anthropologist Greg Cochran is an intellectually voracious man who wants to know where and how humans differ in their genes in order to cure diseases and increase social harmony, or conversely, that he is a latter-day Cesare Lombroso who wants to bust out the calipers to measure our heads to find out which of us have seed worth saving for his eugenic experiments and which of us need to undergo forced sterilization.Having read his ""10,000 Year Explosion"" written by Cochran in conjunction with geneticist Henry Harpending, I found the authors to be intelligent, humorous men capable of explaining very, very complicated concepts in a way that did not scare off this layman. The problem I had with the book was not some kind of moral objection (science doesn't care about my feelings) but rather the nagging sense that this was a paper or presentation stretched out to book length, and that any one of the ideas explicated in the book in one chapter would have made a great book in itself. Dr (?) Cochran cites Jared Diamond's ""Guns, Germs, and Steel"" multiple times throughout the book; I just wish he'd taken the same sort of ""deep dive"" approach to this book in terms of its structure and breadth. In brief (and it's hard to be brief with this information) Cochran argues that human evolution did not stop roughly 40,000 years ago as many believe, and that evolution is an ongoing process, and that this process can ""explode"" in a very local and idiosyncratic way, based on everything from rigorous man-made laws (especially regarding things like out-marriage) to civic arrangements (one of the more disturbing but fascinating detours in the book holds that once humans shifted from hunter-gatherers to agrarians, we started to favor the conforming and even servile over the independent and strong).Someone, in an attempt to summarize this book, called it something like an exploration of history through the lens of genetics, which would be a pretty good capitulation. The authors take the reader from ancient Asian Steppes where Mongol hordes perfected a simple but effective reproduction strategy (kill the men and mate with the women), all the way forward in time to an Israeli hospital in the twenty-first, where the idea that genetic advantages can become disadvantages or can even be made irrelevant is explored. As previously mentioned, all of the subjects dealt with are fascinating, and presented in a clear manner. But it's a bit too thumbnail for my taste. Your take might differ. I'd certainly take a class with Dr. Cochran, though, if I were still in college. I imagine it would be easy to stay awake during his seminars. "
241,0465002218,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32156837-mike,5,"This is a fascinating book on the mutual influence of genes on culture and of culture on genes. The ""explosion"" referred to in the title was the advent of agriculture, which greatly multiplied the size of the human population, greatly altered culture, and redirected human evolution down new paths to adapt to this new culture. When human population increased the rate of genetic mutations increased correspondingly, which increased the rate of evolution (by 100 fold according to the authors). Humans, especially those in densely populated areas, have been evolving rapidly in the last 10,000 years--and their evolution is driven by their environment, including their culture. But, then, newly evolved humans, being different from their ancestors, develop different cultural environments more suitable to their nature. Thus, evolution and human culture form a feedback loop. Of course, in a world of relatively isolated regional and local populations, their will be different natural/cultural environments, hence differential evolution to adapt to them. Inuit amidst ice flows and tundra would not (and did not) evolve the same way as Melanesians on their tropical islands. And evolution may proceed quite rapidly under certain circumstances, particularly large population size and major environmental impetus. On top of well supported scientific theory, the authors add numerous examples of evolution-culture interaction throughout history. It's an important new perspective on history. The style of writing is clear, needless academic jargon wisely jettisoned. The historical examples that run through the book seem somewhat arbitrarily chosen, but, this being a relatively new field of inquiry, the authors are probably just following the trail of such evidence as we currently have. The newness also means we face some uncertainties of interpretation. The authors note evidential limitations when present, but are bold to cast forth their nets in some clever speculations, one of which has been confirmed since publication (non-African humans have some Neanderthal DNA). This is what scientists do and are meant to do when faced with uncertainty: formulate hypotheses, preferably intelligent, informed ones. In this book, we have something of a hybrid beast: a populist approach with some vanguard hypothesizing. "
242,0465002218,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5466619-naftoli,5,"This book has opened my eyes to so many issues; to say that it is transformative is understatement. I had been taught in college that human evolution stopped with the advent of culture, that culture made adjustments to the environment thus eliminating the need for biology to fine tune our bodies. I had also been trained to view IQ tests as simply racist tools used by white patriarchal society to convince the priveleged that minority people are inferior - it sounds hyperbolic but I was actually told this by professors! I had also been taught that all humans are essentially the same (one world, one people, that race is only skin deep). When confronted with differences in intelligence, adaptability, etc. I was taught that this is due to political inequities, war, in short, culture. This book challenges these biases. I will no doubt read this book again at some later date and refer to it from time to time. I am not trained as a scientist so I will have to review and re-review the data from time to time. I was trained as a social scientist - cultural anthropology - so I am the target audience for this book. The issue regarding Neanderthals and what became of them is one of the first issues undertaken in this work; I found it to be both realistic and reasonable. The authors rely on population genetics, mathematics, extrapolations, &c in an effort to buttress their position that modern humans have inherited a small but important percentage of Neanderthal genetic material. It makes sense to me.Among so many things, I admire the authors for having the courage to challenge our current received wisdom. It seems to me that they have taken quite a risk in doing so as there is nothing 'politically correct' about this book. The authors even point to data that most writers shy away from as it may cast them in a negative light. Whatever the reason for shying away from data, it is vital that we humans look facts straight in the face and deal with the realities of our evolution, our cultural wisdom and ethnocentricities, and our impact upon this planet. At the minimum, debate these issues rather than labeling and dismissing them. This book tackles a few of these issues."
243,0465002218,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4534780-alina,5,"The old thinking is that, when cultural evolution took off, biological evolution stopped -- because instead of being shaped by our environment, we began shaping our environment to us. That idea always seemed reasonable to me, but this book has changed my mind. The authors contend that, on the contrary, evolution has sped up since the neolithic revolution. The social innovations associated with agriculture and civilization mean we have subjected ourselves to major new environmental pressures, and that has fueled rapid natural selection. Their idea is that cultural evolution interacts with biological evolution; the two drive each other. One of the book's points is that natural selection isn't as slow as is often believed, since altering just one gene or even one nucleotide can sometimes result in important advantages. By examining evidence from the exploding field of population genetics, as well as other sources, the authors find indications of significant biological change in the past 10,000 years or so. Examples include differing disease resistance in response to local conditions, the development of lactose tolerance in dairy farmers, and selection for higher intelligence among Ashkenazi Jews. Although I'd heard of some of these things before, I hadn't appreciated the impact on history. The authors make a convincing case that genetic factors can be decisive. I no longer think of biological evolution as something that stopped being important once modern humans came into existence."
244,0465002218,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13459886-yhc,4,"We think biological evolution is fasten up the evolution of civilization, this book actually told us another side of story. Agriculture really played a very big role to form the whole new civilization, people settled down, with more food to grow more population, so were the diseases followed ( Animal husbandry kept them moving around, the diseases could not followed with the climate difference that easily). People gather up would also start to form commerce, society and strict hierarchy and government.below i copied the part i found interesting : Ashkenazi jewish. 那么为何德系犹太人特别聪慧呢？想要解答这个谜题，或许我们可以看看关于阿什肯纳兹犹太人的DNA我们都知道些什么，因为事实证明它们还有另一个有趣的特征。即，它们有一组不常见的严重遗传病，例如家族性黑蒙性痴呆症、高雪氏病、家族性自主神经功能异常，以及两种不同形式的遗传性乳腺癌（BRCA1和BRCA2），这些疾病在阿什肯纳兹犹太人群体中的发病率比在其他欧洲人群中高将近100倍。我们相信这两个谜题有单一的解释。我们认为阿什肯纳兹犹太人在北欧逗留的时期在白领职业的自然选择中获得了成功，而这成功源自他们智力上的遗传优势。但对于智力的强势选择也产生了一些让人不愉快的副作用：提高遗传携带者智商的等位基因同时也对纯合体产生损害。这一类解释自然是有争议的。事实上很多人排斥这一类说法：智力是可测量的，由遗传决定的，不同的人类群体间有智力上的差异。有趣的是，这些批评和斥责甚少来自从事认知测试及其结果分析的科学工作者。业内对此很少或几乎没有任何争议，智商测试是准确的，测试结果能预测学术成就和个体生活的其他方面，而且智商值有极高的遗传率。如果遗传的确能影响智力，那么一段时间后，智力带来的繁殖优势必然会带来更高的智力。这个简单的逻辑是关于自然选择的演化理论的核心：能增加繁殖的基因在人类群体中会随时间推移变得越来越常见。.................我们认为印欧扩张起始于乳糖耐受突变的频率增高，当其频率增高至足以使整个人群转型从事制乳业经济的时候，印欧人就迅速扩散至整个南俄大草原。这迅速的扩张就有可能导致说近似语言的同一人群分散在从当今的乌克兰直到乌拉尔河地区这一广阔区域。因为扩张如此迅速，语言还没有分化，所以这一广大区域中分散的人群说的还是相似的语言。印欧人前进的步伐持续至进入欧洲，在那里制乳业在生态学效应上足以跟早期农业竞争，而且前者催生了一种远远更具侵略性的文化。印欧文化很可能是更好战的，因为印欧人群的高机动性、更多的人口数量和更好的营养使他们能比其他人群更经常赢得战争。而他们的胜利反过来又会提升他们的军事行动效率，从而成功哺育了更多成功。从印欧人基因在欧洲基因库占的相对低的比例来看，他们似乎实行的是精英统治，做被征服人群的统治者但没有摧毁或替代原先的居住者。然而相对小的精英人口常常能够让所有其余人口说他们的语言。此外，印欧人还把乳糖耐受的等位基因加进了本地的混合基因库。乳糖耐受突变在印欧人入侵前的欧洲很罕见或根本不存在，然而当制乳业受自然选择青睐的时候，它就在欧洲变得很常见了，特别是在北欧。[20]印欧语言和文化在制乳业流行的地域传播扩散，比方说，它们还进入了南欧和伊朗，然而中东的强势国家们似乎阻止了这些语言文化进入中东。我们认为印欧扩张起始于乳糖耐受突变的频率增高，当其频率增高至足以使整个人群转型从事制乳业经济的时候，印欧人就迅速扩散至整个南俄大草原。这迅速的扩张就有可能导致说近似语言的同一人群分散在从当今的乌克兰直到乌拉尔河地区这一广阔区域。因为扩张如此迅速，语言还没有分化，所以这一广大区域中分散的人群说的还是相似的语言。印欧人前进的步伐持续至进入欧洲，在那里制乳业在生态学效应上足以跟早期农业竞争，而且前者催生了一种远远更具侵略性的文化。印欧文化很可能是更好战的，因为印欧人群的高机动性、更多的人口数量和更好的营养使他们能比其他人群更经常赢得战争。而他们的胜利反过来又会提升他们的军事行动效率，从而成功哺育了更多成功。从印欧人基因在欧洲基因库占的相对低的比例来看，他们似乎实行的是精英统治，做被征服人群的统治者但没有摧毁或替代原先的居住者。然而相对小的精英人口常常能够让所有其余人口说他们的语言。此外，印欧人还把乳糖耐受的等位基因加进了本地的混合基因库。乳糖耐受突变在印欧人入侵前的欧洲很罕见或根本不存在，然而当制乳业受自然选择青睐的时候，它就在欧洲变得很常见了，特别是在北欧。[20]印欧语言和文化在制乳业流行的地域传播扩散，比方说，它们还进入了南欧和伊朗，然而中东的强势国家们似乎阻止了这些语言文化进入中东。.......一开始他们是作为基督教与穆斯林世界的中介的国际商人。然而随着穆斯林和基督徒（特别是意大利人）逐渐开始直接通商，阿什肯纳兹犹太商人越来越多地开始从事本地贸易。当对犹太人的迫害越来越严重从而长距离旅行无法得到安全保障之后，德系犹太人越来越专注于金融业，这个行业对他们是敞开的，因为基督徒被禁止放高利贷。在公元1100年前绝大部分德系犹太人都是放贷者，这一模式延续了几个世纪。[15]这些职业（交易和金融业）有很高的智商需求，我们可以肯定没有其他人类群体有这么高数量比例的人口在长时段内从事需要很高认知能力的职业。有时我们能找到相当详尽的阿什肯纳兹犹太人的商业活动记录。比如关于南法鲁西永犹太人在约公元1270年就有这样的记录：“有全面证据证明这群犹太人以放贷为生，实质上完全没有从事任何其他种类的经济活动。有记录的228名男性犹太人中近八成在向他们的基督教邻居放贷。犹太女人（几乎都是寡妇）放贷的也很常见，这些来自弱势者的资本被投资到相似的渠道。并且最积极从事放贷的犹太人似乎在他们的群体内是最受尊崇的。................他们曾是波兰立陶宛王国的管理者阶层。除了读写能力之外，在这些特定职业上取得成功所依靠的是类似于现今商人的素质，至少也需要有追踪复杂交易和资金流动的能力。最终，随着波兰立陶宛王国的阿什肯纳兹犹太人人口数量上升，越来越多的犹太人成了手工艺者——毕竟对管理和金融职业的需求也是有一定限度的。然而在800到900年的时间段内，也就是大致从公元800年到公元1650或1700年，绝大部分的阿什肯纳兹犹太人从事的是管理和金融业，也就是复杂度很高的职业，他们几乎从来不当农民和匠人。在这个方面他们和所有其他定居人口都有所不同。事实上，在那个时代任何占有领地的人类族群都不可能有那么高比例的人口从事白领职业，因为这样农业生产率就会过低。九成的人口都必须务农，从而生产足够的粮食去养活他们自己和社会顶层少量的统治者、文员、士兵、匠人以及商人。对白领职业的自然选择只有在这一阶层独自成为一个族群的时候才有可能成功，这一族群必须靠职业而非其据地而界定。在高复杂度职业中取得成功的犹太人享有更高的遗传优势。学者怀里波说：“在富裕的家庭中有更多的孩子能活到成年。总体上属于更富裕阶层的许多商业领袖、显赫拉比、群体领袖和类似个体的谱系显示，这些人通常有4个、6个甚至8～9个孩子活到成年。........智商有很高的可遗传性。这意味着一个个体的智商值会部分取决于遗传影响，从而更接近他或她的父母和兄弟姐妹而不是随便哪个别人。同一对父母生下的子女即便在不同环境下养大也会有相近的智商值，而领养的兄弟姐妹即便在同一屋檐下长大也不会有相近的智商值。高度也是类似的：长得高的人更可能有高于平均身高的子女。事实上，成年人的智商值与身高一样主要受遗传因素影响。然而童年的智商值却受遗传影响更少，而更容易受周围环境影响。周围环境对儿童智商测试结果的影响会在青春期期间或其后消失，这成了美国先锋计划（Head Start Program）的基础，即宣扬智商值能因一定干预而提高。非遗传因素同样会影响智商值，但很多情况下那些起作用的因素都不是人们想象会起作用的因素。父母关爱、母乳喂养、营养情况、早教、子宫中听莫扎特音乐和燕麦麸几乎都没起什么作用。而让人惊讶的是，一个家庭养育孩子的方式看起来对孩子成年时的智商值没有任何影响。这有效地反驳了一些流行的环境决定论——它们对阿什肯纳兹犹太人的高智商做各种成长环境方面的解释，尤其反驳了那些认为犹太母亲用特殊的方式抚养孩子催发了他们的高智商的论调。...在阿什肯纳兹犹太人特别高发的遗传病中，广为人知的是家族性黑蒙性痴呆症、高雪氏病和BRCA1与BRCA2乳腺癌突变，但同时还有许多其他的疾病，比如尼曼匹克症、卡纳万病和家族性自主神经功能异常。有些会引起神经方面的问题。它们在阿什肯纳兹犹太人身上特别高发，这已经成了人类遗传学上一个长久的谜题。.....是什么样的性征在阿什肯纳兹犹太人身上比在他们的邻居身上更宝贵呢？嗯，我们有一些很强的线索。是什么性征在当今的德系犹太人身上最突出呢？他们是壮大如萨摩亚人，高如图西族人，以及牛奶耐受如荷兰人吗？不是的，他们的特殊性征就是智力。这些突变体本身就提示了这一点：它们中的一些看起来就很像会提高智商的，考虑到它们作用于中枢神经系统的发展。鞘脂类突变体特别有可能具有提升智力的作用。在每一种这类突变体中，都有一些特定鞘脂累积；这些鞘脂是变更过的脂类分子，它们在信号传输中起作用，并在神经组织中特别常见。研究者已经确定这些鞘脂类作用水平的提升会引致神经元（中枢神经系统的基本细胞）之间更多的连接（高雪氏病的轴突生长）。在家族性黑蒙性痴呆症的情形中有相似的效应：特定的累积混合物（GM2神经节苷脂）作用水平提升会促进树突（连接神经元的纤细多分支突起）的增长。[41]这种树突生成的增加现象也同样发生在A型尼曼匹克细胞出现、动物版黑蒙性痴呆症和尼曼匹克病的情形下。这些都是已知的疾病等位基因中唯一能引致神经连接增加的因素。我们同时还有（并不确凿的）证据证明德系犹太人身上常见的一些基因变异有可能提升智力。我们研究了耶路撒冷高雪氏病患者的职业——实际上是所有在耶路撒冷沙尔泽德克医学中心（Shaare Zedek Medical Centre）治疗的患者。这些患者成为工程师或科学家的概率比以色列阿什肯纳兹犹太人从事这些职业的平均概率要高很多，事实上大概要高11倍。[42]关于阿什肯纳兹犹太人的另一种遗传病扭转性肌张力障碍也有类似的研究结果。这种遗传病最初被诊断出来的时候，研究者就已经开始注意到其患者不同寻常的智力水平。.....结论文化革新在很长的时间里都是人类生物学变化的驱动力，在约250万年前人类开始使用工具之后就一直如此。自然选择青睐那些从事早期文化革新的原始人类大脑，而这些革新本身就导向更多身体和心理上的变化。生物学特征和文化特征的协同演化一开始是很缓慢的，至少以现代标准看是慢的，但渐渐演化速度就快起来了。考古学记录显示我们的革新能力持续上升，直至约4万年前，我们已经为所谓的“人类革命”或旧石器时代晚期欧洲和亚洲北部的“创造性大爆发”蓄势待发。技术和艺术的突然兴盛发生在人类扩张并走出非洲的不久以后；它同时也跟生物学变化有关，而我们猜想这些生物学变化部分是由从尼安德特人或其他远古人类（亚洲大陆更早的占据者）身上偷得的基因驱动的。行为现代化导致更多的变化：人类制作更精良的工具，然后他们在数代人的时间里也反过来被这些工具不断塑造变化。农业出现之后，文化和生物演化都加速了，因为新的生活方式使人们有了新的需求。农业出现以前人类一直都是觅食者：农业带来的人口急剧增加使得更多有益的变异体出现，也使得更多新想法出现。我们人类在农业传播后的快速演化的确是一万年的爆发。 这爆发如今还在持续：人类演化并没有止步于解剖学意义上的现代人类出现，或他们扩张走出非洲的时候。它从来没有停止。而且它怎么会停下呢？演化停滞需要一个静滞的环境，而行为现代化一直带来的都是革新和变化。一直以来我们都不曾有稳定和静滞的环境。这一点应该是很明显的，然而人类科学不仅忽视了它，相反还一直在一个奇怪的前提下辛勤地做研究，这个奇怪的想法认为演化在4万年前就停止了。 所有这些都意味着也必然意味着，生物变化是驱动历史的重要因素。当然它不是唯一的因素，而且很奇怪的是，它还被与更传统的影响绑定在一起。诸如乳糖耐受一类的遗传变化的出现和传播是文化革新（例如农业的发展）的结果，它同时也源自随机出现的合适的突变。这些遗传变化反过来也对文化产生了影响。印欧人的扩张，欧洲人在北美和澳大利亚的成功定居，“瓜分非洲”的失败，阿什肯纳兹犹太人进入智力舞台，甚至有可能工业革命和科学的兴起，所有这些看来都是生物和文化变化之永恒的舞步所营造的。 如果人类科学的研究者们继续忽略自然选择从未停止作用这一事实，他们就会把许多重要问题的解答线索给丢掉，把谜题变成秘密。科尔特斯带着500人就征服并控制了几百万人的帝国。想要解释这件事情而不提持续演化带来的疾病抵御机制中的生物学差异，这完全不可能。公元前5世纪的修昔底德说人类特征是不会变化的，所以可以预测，而当今许多科学家相信人类特征几万年前就停止了改变。历史学家们似乎一直以此为研究的前提。然而这样一来他们就忽略了巨大的契机，不仅在于解读人类的往昔，而且也在于塑造未来。贯穿人类历史的持续演化一直是一个巨大的自然界的实验，这个实验承诺了我们在理解自身、抵御疾病和精神病症方面的巨大的成果。利莫内苏尔加尔达隐藏着关于人类疾病的一个重要线索。世界上大概有100万个这样的小村庄，一定有更多类似的线索等待我们去发现。人类历史为我们展现的一些实验的成果甚至有可能帮助我们进行更有野心的尝试，去增加人类寿命和认知能力。从事人类科学的学者们是时候去甩掉一系列关于演化停止和“心理均一”的僵化教条了。每一刻时间都很宝贵，我们有一整个世界要去争取呢。"

I will give it 4/5 on account of me enjoying the ideas. These ideas, however, convince me to the extent of them ""making sense"". As a scientist I do expect much more in order to be convinced. I understand that this would make the book significantly longer and it might not necessarily be aimed for the ""general public"", but I would argue that here we don't really see the case of oversimplification being the issue, since the ideas, terminology, methodology described etc. are not necessarily ""dumbed down"". Instead, there is a certain haughty attitude - judging by this book alone, everybody other than the authors thinks genetic changes in human beings stopped 40,000 years ago and is wholly dogmatic. "
246,0465002218,http://goodreads.com/user/show/77887124-paul-clark,1,"This book rejects the view that race is primarily a social construct and proposes five hypotheses about genetic differences between ethnic groups. The first two, lactose tolerance and resistance to pathogens, are physiological and uncontroversial. The same cannot be said of the other three: that interbreeding between Eurasians and Neanderthals increased Eurasian intelligence, that long-term exposure to agriculture leads to a greater predisposition to the ‘bourgeois’ values of hard work and restraint, and that medieval restrictions on Ashkenazi Jews raised their intelligence. This review will focus on these three hypotheses.THE NEANDERTHAL ADVANTAGEHomo sapiens first encountered Neanderthals after leaving Africa 40,000 years ago. Cochran and Harpending speculate that interbreeding between the two species raised Eurasian intelligence, triggering the Upper Palaeolithic revolution in technology, symbolic behaviour and socio-economic organisation. Quite how sub-Saharan Africans later managed the same transition to modern behaviour without the benefit of Neanderthal DNA, the authors do not say.In any case, many archaeologists favour non-genetic explanations for the transition. Others argue that it occurred in Africa much earlier, citing discoveries like a large 70,000 year-old settlement in Sudan and sophisticated 44,000 year-old southern African artefacts. If critics of the Upper Palaeolithic model turn out to be correct, Cochran and Harpending’s highly speculative hypothesis would be falsified.THE AGRICULTURAL REVOLUTION AND BOURGEOIS VALUESThe authors claim that the development of agriculture led to the spread of genes for hard work and restraint among those populations in the Middle East, East Asia and Europe that have been exposed to agriculture for longest.Whilst superficially convincing, their account has serious flaws. The most glaring is the claim that ADHD has been bred out of China, where it actually affects up to 5% of schoolchildren. Other claims presented as facts are in reality matters of dispute. Agriculture might have arisen in sub-Saharan Africa 1,000 years earlier than the authors state, and their claim that Australian Aborigines never developed agriculture is contested.In most pre-capitalist societies, hard work did not have the significance the authors give it because any attempt to rise above your station was seen as sinful and peasants generally did as little work as they could get away with. The way people accumulated wealth was to squeeze it out of someone else as a warlord, a landlord or the holder of a sinecure that enabled them to milk others.Traders who acquired wealth through hard work dreamed of turning it into land, finding an impoverished noble family to marry into and putting their feet up. The only ones unable to do this were religious minorities like Armenians, Jews, Lebanese and Parsees. Cochran and Harpending claim that bourgeois genes made these communities successful middlemen when in fact it was their minority religion that trapped them in this niche.Similarly dubious is the claim that a lack of bourgeois genes fuels opposition to neo-liberalism in Latin America. Surely the growth of the industrial working class is a better explanation for the influence of socialism there.The authors contrast farmers who refrain from eating their seed corn with hunter gatherers who scupper efforts to turn them into herders by eating all their goats. But are hunter gatherers really so stupid? Or is this a case of a top-down innovation deliberately sabotaged by a community that never wanted it?The claim that aggression has been bred out of those populations longest exposed to agriculture is undermined by Cohen and Nisbett’s famous study that found startling differences in levels of aggression between genetically indistinguishable people from different cultures.THE INTELLIGENCE OF AHKANAZI JEWSCochran and Harpending’s third controversial hypothesis concerns the high IQs of Ashkenazi Jews, allegedly 12-15 points above other Europeans. They favour the theory that this is genetically determined because medieval north European Jews were restricted to white-collar occupations, particularly money lending, in which only intelligent people could succeed, giving them greater reproductive success in a community where marrying out was forbidden.However, the data they present is superficial. The influence of heritability on IQ shifts during a person’s life, rising dramatically as children grow to adulthood. But the authors never give the ages of the people in their statistics, making them impossible to assess.Their claim that 80% of economically active medieval Ashkenazim were full-time moneylenders is unconvincing, since Jews were confined to ghettoes with separate micro-economies, and rules forbidding the ‘improper subordination’ of Christians by Jews would probably have created the need for a Jewish servant class.Despite these caveats, this hypothesis is credible if unproven. There is no a priori reason why the heritable intelligence of every ethnic group should be the same and the Ashkenazim are a genetically closed community with a unique history.CONCLUSIONSThe 10,000 Year Explosion makes noteworthy points about physiological differences between the races and asks an interesting question about the intelligence of Ashkenazi Jews without quite supplying the answer. But it has conspicuously failed to demonstrate any other link between race and either intelligence or character. Cochran and Harpending’s Neanderthal hypothesis is highly speculative, and their claims about bourgeois values and agriculture rest on questionable evidence and a willingness to ignore simpler and more obvious explanations.Please see my website for a longer and fully sourced version of this review."
247,0465002218,http://goodreads.com/user/show/84499280-david-baer,4,"I got worried reading the introduction, because (among many others) they thanked Phil Rushton, who I remember from a lifetime ago as being in the news in a bad way, as in using his research to either promote or implicitly support racist ideologies. But I continued anyway, because I find the subject matter fascinating.Because, as I opined in my review of Before the Dawn: Recovering the Lost History of Our Ancestors, it's not by definition racist to inquire into the genetic basis of racial variation - it's only racist if you use such inquiry to justify privilege for one group, or even to consider one group as inherently superior to another. So, for example, it's not racist to find the genetic basis for why Kenyans are so successful at long-distance running. It is racist to conclude from that fact, that, I don't know, say, ""driving while black"" isn't really a thing. Or that separation of the ""races"" is a good thing, etc etc.This book isn't racist, in my opinion - but I understand how it could come off as such. The thing about Ashkenazi Jews having enhanced intelligence has a certain taint to it, because it's been used to justify (racist) hierarchies of the ""races"". And this thing about the Ashkenazi Jews comes up again and again: because they experienced unique conditions of repression in northern Europe for a thousand years, those who could really be successful in intellectually challenging roles such as (principally) money-lending, were more reproductively successful. So there is a lot of evidence presented, and I buy it, and I don't believe I am racist for buying it, but still - there are a lot of racists who also buy it, and that makes me a bit uncomfortable.Even though the book has a lot of footnotes and a good bibliography, I felt the authors did a poor job of constructing arguments. It seemed they were all over the place, all the time - promising answers and then discursively wandering away from what they promised to answer, never getting back to it. Like on page 91 we are told ""we now understand quite a bit about the genetic changes that led to light skin in northern Eurasians."" Wow! That's a big statement; I was prepared for a big explanation. But a dozen pages of stuff later, they were moving on to another topic; I carefully re-read the intervening pages, which were all quite interesting, but I confirmed that they definitely never delivered on their promised explanation of skin color.I give it 4 stars because I love the subject matter and am fascinated by the implications of the fact that all modern people emerged from a small African population of humans who lived about 50kya. Our written history is so microscopic compared to all of what must have happened - just to know what we can infer from genetics to fill in the blanks is amazing. Unfortunately racists will also find much to love in this book; I can't help that and it's not the fault of the authors either."
248,0465002218,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50953703-groot,5,"The rate of human evolution has accelerated radically over the last 10,000 years. This takes a genetic perspective on history and archaeology, benefiting from the vast improvement in the science and technology of genomic knowledge. Organisms, including people, adapt to changing environments, and our environment is changing radically, starting with the Upper Paleolithic, the introduction of farming, settling into towns, domesticating animals (including milk-yielding species), the vast increase in the number of humans and consequent breeding ground for infectious diseases, literacy and numeracy and their contribution to human prospering for those that could excel at them, and so on. A fascinating book, with some safe and interesting insights, but not shying away from more controversial hypotheses, such as the contributions of proto-humans, such as Neanderthals and Denisovans, to modern humans, with their longer-term adaptations to living in northern climes, possibly contributing lighter skin and other features."

Arguments from natural selection are used to explain patterns in world history, including Europeans' success in displacing Amerindians in the Americas and their failure to displace Africans in the tropical parts of that continent. It's a quick read, and very enlightening.While the authors make their case very clearly, I would have liked to see them explore whether modern medical science -- or demographics in general -- has weakened the link between ""reproductive fitness"" and actual numbers of descendants. Given that so much infectious disease can be treated or controlled, quality food and good sanitation are abundant, and many very ""reproductively fit"" people choose to have small families (or none at all), does their thesis still apply? Will the next 10,000 years be like the last 10,000 were?"

The tens of thousands of years since we left Africa were not enough for evolution to do anything more than tweak us around the edges and the time since the agricultural revolution is a mere blink of an evolutionary eye and human evolution has more or less slowed to a crawl.The 10,000 Year Explosion is evolutionary psychology dialed up to 11. Rather than slowing down, evolution has actually sped up. Genetic change was responsible not just for the agricultural revolution but the scientific and industrial revolutions too, not to mention the rise and fall of empires. Examples of candidate mutations abound. The sum of the books arguments, though was unconvincing. "

With a firm root in evolutionary theory, Cochran and Harpending convinces anyone who isn't blind or an absolute idiot about the impossibility of evolutionary pressures on humans halting to a stop. The authors lays out evolutionary thinking in such a way that the reader will by the end of the book feel a lot more confident in her understanding of the world. It should truly be read by everyone.The book can be read by anyone without any prior knowledge on evolutionary theory. The minimum level of the book is high-school. This due to the authors' superior skill in laying out and explaining every phenomenon in the most simple manner. "

The concept of a variant on 'artificial selection' as is observed for dogs and other domesticated animals and plants, seems suggested although not explicit. This seems based on advantages for particular populations, with more offspring among those with particular genetic traits and cultural adaptations such as herding, farming, urbanization, domestic animals such as horses, and improved military weaponry. Pretty persuasive that the process seems ongoing."

Then the modern human out of africa confonrting Neaderteals is also interesting. Then I brought the book with me on my trips to Chengdu with parents and reading became on and off and hard to concentrate. So the middle part of the book is a bit lost to me. Then I returned home and read the last chapter about why a branch of Jews (German Jews) are super smart while bearing more genetic diseases really really interesting and I learned a lot. This last chapter alone make the book deserve a 5 star.

266,0465002218,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12991284-jeremy,3,"As a long time reader of science books I was immediately attracted to this book due to its great title – titles are important, take note publishers. The last science book I read was the great The Fifth Miracle by Paul Davies, which was an examination of how life evolved. Cochran and Harpending’s book promised an argument against the long held theory that humans stopped evolving fifty thousand years ago, just after emerging out of Africa. The book describes itself as the “…the latest edition to the fast emerging discipline of biohistory.” There’s been quite a bit of news related to this area lately, so I thought that it was time to give it a read.The book opens with a refutation of “conventional wisdom”, with the authors claiming that human evolution has accelerated in the last ten thousand years due to various selection pressures, such as agriculture, geographic expansion and climate change. They go on to examine the period that started fifty to forty thousand years ago when modern humans moved into the European territories of the Neanderthal. Ten thousand years later the Neanderthal were extinct and humans were flourishing. No one knows for sure but it seems that humans displayed better adaptations such as advanced language, tools and hunting techniques. There is convincing genetic evidence that we interbreed with Neanderthals and picked up and kept various advantageous genes – just ask Ozzy Osbourne. The ensuing four chapters examine the impact of the advent of agriculture some ten thousand years ago and how the changes to what we ate affected our genetic makeup; the genetic flow of humanity as expressed by selective sweeps of particular genes and also the impact of expansion on humans throughout the globe. A succinct summary - but if you want to know the facts then read the book! But is it worth reading?The ideas presented in The 10,000 Year Explosion are certainly well argued. The authors blend history, archaeology, paleontology and biology to weave their arguments convincingly. They refer to their work as “genetic history” – a “new kind of history.” This is all very well but unfortunately the flaw of this book is that the writing style is relatively bland. There is an effort to engage and give the facts some personality, but as interested as I was in the arguments presented I often found myself bored. I believe that writing popular science is a tricky thing, because, after all, you don’t want to dumb it down; but also you don’t want to put the average reader off either. After reading this book I appreciate science writers such as Paul Davies and Marcus Chown for their efforts to both explain and engage.The 10,000 Year Explosion ends with a case study of the Ashkenazi Jews – Jews that were confined to Europe from medieval times and that were restricted to money lending and clerical professions; the kind of jobs that required a certain level of intelligence. The combination of the demands of their profession and their tendency to marry within their faith meant that the European Jews were selected for a higher intelligence than Jews in the Middle East. Five hundred or so years later descendants of this group were making the major scientific breakthroughs throughout many disciplines and they also displayed higher IQs than other groups. A fascinating case study, but once again the bland writing created a nagging sense of boredom.The story of human evolution is an amazing tale to behold - one that’s obsessed me on and off for years. It’s compelling, fascinating and most of all it’s our story. Unfortunately this book does not really capture the sense of wonder that our story can engender, which is a shame. Read this book if you want the facts, but perhaps look elsewhere if you want to feel that elusive sense of wonder. Although I was slightly disappointed overall, the one interesting thing this book did do for me was to make me ponder just how our present point in human evolutionary history will be viewed in five hundred years; and that’s not such a bad thing."
267,0465002218,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17431775-schwarzenberger,3,"Considering the subject matter, it is a light read with a lot of little tidbits thrown in about how many relatives Genghis Khan has that are still living across central Asia, how disease really helped Pizarro and only 168 soldiers tear apart the Inca Empire, where blue eyes originated, and other such scientific matters that make great dinner conversation and cocktail party opening lines.By the way, i like the cover with the almost stroboscopic depiction of evolutionary influenced skeletal uprightness and locomotion. It is a grabber of a design that gets your eye from across the floor of the library or bookshop.The authors may not like this, but I am giving away a highly kept secret they mention in the index--Yes I actually do read indices, to me they give a sense of the real core of a book and let you know what the authors think is really important. If you have limited time perusing the index gets you right to the action. Well, in the index there is an entry--Lost Dutchman Mine, location, 400. I guess this means that one or both of the authors knows where this reputedly amazingly rich gold mine is hidden. It is a legend in its own right, I'm sure there are some good books about it and Wikipedia says people are still looking for it. The authors know where it is and they are telling you. It is all on page 400! However, my paperback edition (2010) only has 288 pages including the index. It's a wonderfully hidden joke that I did not see mentioned in any other review. I guess we'll have to wait another 10,000 years for the ""20,000 Year Explosion"" followup edition that will explain how humans have evolved since the demise of print books, audio CDs, broadcast television, sidewalks and other signs of civilization. Hopefully this newer edition will have a page 400.To me this was a fascinating read. ""Explosion"" discusses human genetics and evolution, a subject that I have found interesting for a long time but have not actually had the patience to really delve into in order to get a comprehensive basis for true knowledge--I feel that it would take a little more time than I want to dedicate to find out more about organic chemistry and processes of how organic molecules act and react with other to make up DNA mechanisms, and how that affects how life works etc. I did tackle ""The Eight Day of Creation"" some decades ago...what I read of it was fascinating but then life's personal activities got in the way. But the thing that really stopped me was that I kept the used copy (It cost only 1 dollar) of the book I bought on a back shelf for about 10 years and then when I finally started reading it and got a little more than half way through--it is an 800 page monster--I realized that it was mis-bound and many pages were duplicated but also very mixed up and completely out of order. More importantly, a lot was missing overall and the local library didn't have a copy that that could be loaned out to read. I was not going to sit in the library and work my way through it. So basically, that's now where I left my knowledge of genes and DNA and alleles and the mechanics of genetics.That said, I did appreciate the simplification in general that the authors made to get their point across. That point is that we are still evolving, our physiology is still reacting to the environment around us trying to adapt us in the best way possible to allow for species survival and thriving. It's a good read and will get me to read more about this subject. Parts of their theses reminded me of Julian Jaynes' book with that wonderful title--""The Development of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind"" and his theory that we humans finally realized that it wasn't the Gods talking to each and every one of us, it was just our brains finally melding messages together across the corpus callosum inside each of our skulls."
268,0465002218,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1219617-erik,3,"Cochran and Harpending dispel the long-held scientific notion that human evolution reached a plateau tens of thousands of years ago, as well as all change has been cultural. Instead, they argue that cultural change has effected genetic change, and vice versa. Not only did agriculture select for certain characteristics – like lactose tolerance as a result of animal husbandry, for one – but so introgression with Neanderthals, which has been historically frowned upon in the scientific community due to biased in favor of the notion homo sapiens purity. ""The explosion is ongoing: Human evolution didn’t stop when anatomically modern humans appeared, or when they expanded out of Africa. It never stopped – and why would it? Evolutionary stasis requires a static environment, whereas behavioral modernity is all about innovation and change. Stability is exactly what we have not had. This should be obvious, but instead the human sciences have labored under the strange idea that evolution stopped 40,000 years ago.""One of their most controversial notions is their well-supported argument that the Ashkenazi Jews of Eastern Europe have a genetic propensity for higher intelligence as a direct result of marriage only within their community combined with societal pressures against intermarriage with gentiles, strict limitations on what kinds of white-collars jobs they could hold (banking, finance, science), and the resulting economic rewards for succeeding economically (higher birth rate, better heated homes, more personal privacy in those homes that helped thwart contact with diseases fatal to the more impoverished, etc.). All of these combined set the conditions for natural selection that resulted in a better-educated and genetically-insular population with a slightly higher-than-average IQ when compared to the other European genetic groups that they lived alongside. Perhaps this is a stretch for the politically correct crowd, but it certainly is worthy of reasoned debate and consideration. (On the flip side, Cochran and Harpending are quick to remind us that the Ashkenazi Jews also have an accompanying genetic predisposition for various diseases that other groups do not have.)As an educator, I was particularly struck by their assertion that ""Nongenetic factors also influence IQ, but for the most part, the ones that matter are not the ones people thought would matter. Prenatal care, breastfeeding, nutrition, access to early education, Mozart in the womb, and oat bran all have little or no effect. Surprisingly, the way in which a family raised children seems to have no effect on adult IQ.""Alas, neither Cochran nor Harpending go on to detail just what nongenetic factors can or do influence IQ. (I would argue that the quality of formal education be one.)On a style note, I admit to wishing several times for either Richard Dawkins or Jared Diamond’s more persuasive and personable narrative styles. (No surprise, Diamond’s Guns, Germs, and Steel and The Third Chimpanzee are both quoted numerous times.) Of course, knowing that this is the first book between the Cochran and Harpending, I imagine that they will both improve in this area in future books the co-write. "
269,0465002218,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4975079-daniel-hammer,4,"This is just the kind of exciting, accessible and provocative science that I like to read about. For the most part. Cochran and Harpending's book presents the argument that human evolution has increased in pace over the last 10,000 years. This is in contrast to a more standard view which argues that, due to the ability to culturally and technologically reshape our environment, modern human beings have less of a need to evolve biologically in response to environmental pressures. He begins with a few basics of populations genetic which support the likelihood of an increased rate of evolution in recent times. Among these are the increase in human population numbers; more people equals more chances for mutations to develop. Also important is the fact that our diets have changed more in the past 10,000 years than had hominin diets for the previous several million years. This would have introduced significant dietary pressures on us, and those who could tolerate or process certain foods (such as lactose) would be more evolutionarily successful. 10,000 years ago is a key starting point because it corresponds with the advent of agriculture, which introduced larger populations, new diets, crowded living, and more.Cochran and Harpending survey a range or very interesting ideas. They argue that humans almost definitely bred with Neanderthals. That lactose tolerance was a key to the spread of Indo-European languages, via the adaptable, milk-drinking people which spoke those tongues. They examine a number of genetic mutations which are limited to certain populations and reflect recent genetic (evolutionary) responses to environment and diet, like sickle-cell trait. They suggest that light skin color may have evolved for more than just the ability to synthesize more vitamin D, and that the human brain likely underwent important structural changes just in the past 30,000 years.All of this is seriously interesting, and a pleasure to read and debate. The downside is that Cochran and Harpending are slim on evidence for much of this. I an inclined to believe they are largely correct, but too often the book reads like a laundry list of exciting suggestions, without much to back them up.This book certainly worth a quick read and makes some great food for thought."
270,0465002218,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19773041-joseph-hirsch,3,"Depending on a whole host of factors (your scientific background, religion, personal experiences, and biases, to name a few) one could come away from ""The 10,000 Year Explosion"" thinking that anthropologist Greg Cochran is an intellectually voracious man who wants to know where and how humans differ in their genes in order to cure diseases and increase social harmony, or conversely, that he is a latter-day Cesare Lombroso who wants to bust out the calipers to measure our heads to find out which of us have seed worth saving for his eugenic experiments and which of us need to undergo forced sterilization.Having read his ""10,000 Year Explosion"" written by Cochran in conjunction with geneticist Henry Harpending, I found the authors to be intelligent, humorous men capable of explaining very, very complicated concepts in a way that did not scare off this layman. The problem I had with the book was not some kind of moral objection (science doesn't care about my feelings) but rather the nagging sense that this was a paper or presentation stretched out to book length, and that any one of the ideas explicated in the book in one chapter would have made a great book in itself. Dr (?) Cochran cites Jared Diamond's ""Guns, Germs, and Steel"" multiple times throughout the book; I just wish he'd taken the same sort of ""deep dive"" approach to this book in terms of its structure and breadth. In brief (and it's hard to be brief with this information) Cochran argues that human evolution did not stop roughly 40,000 years ago as many believe, and that evolution is an ongoing process, and that this process can ""explode"" in a very local and idiosyncratic way, based on everything from rigorous man-made laws (especially regarding things like out-marriage) to civic arrangements (one of the more disturbing but fascinating detours in the book holds that once humans shifted from hunter-gatherers to agrarians, we started to favor the conforming and even servile over the independent and strong).Someone, in an attempt to summarize this book, called it something like an exploration of history through the lens of genetics, which would be a pretty good capitulation. The authors take the reader from ancient Asian Steppes where Mongol hordes perfected a simple but effective reproduction strategy (kill the men and mate with the women), all the way forward in time to an Israeli hospital in the twenty-first, where the idea that genetic advantages can become disadvantages or can even be made irrelevant is explored. As previously mentioned, all of the subjects dealt with are fascinating, and presented in a clear manner. But it's a bit too thumbnail for my taste. Your take might differ. I'd certainly take a class with Dr. Cochran, though, if I were still in college. I imagine it would be easy to stay awake during his seminars. "
271,0465002218,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32156837-mike,5,"This is a fascinating book on the mutual influence of genes on culture and of culture on genes. The ""explosion"" referred to in the title was the advent of agriculture, which greatly multiplied the size of the human population, greatly altered culture, and redirected human evolution down new paths to adapt to this new culture. When human population increased the rate of genetic mutations increased correspondingly, which increased the rate of evolution (by 100 fold according to the authors). Humans, especially those in densely populated areas, have been evolving rapidly in the last 10,000 years--and their evolution is driven by their environment, including their culture. But, then, newly evolved humans, being different from their ancestors, develop different cultural environments more suitable to their nature. Thus, evolution and human culture form a feedback loop. Of course, in a world of relatively isolated regional and local populations, their will be different natural/cultural environments, hence differential evolution to adapt to them. Inuit amidst ice flows and tundra would not (and did not) evolve the same way as Melanesians on their tropical islands. And evolution may proceed quite rapidly under certain circumstances, particularly large population size and major environmental impetus. On top of well supported scientific theory, the authors add numerous examples of evolution-culture interaction throughout history. It's an important new perspective on history. The style of writing is clear, needless academic jargon wisely jettisoned. The historical examples that run through the book seem somewhat arbitrarily chosen, but, this being a relatively new field of inquiry, the authors are probably just following the trail of such evidence as we currently have. The newness also means we face some uncertainties of interpretation. The authors note evidential limitations when present, but are bold to cast forth their nets in some clever speculations, one of which has been confirmed since publication (non-African humans have some Neanderthal DNA). This is what scientists do and are meant to do when faced with uncertainty: formulate hypotheses, preferably intelligent, informed ones. In this book, we have something of a hybrid beast: a populist approach with some vanguard hypothesizing. "
272,0465002218,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5466619-naftoli,5,"This book has opened my eyes to so many issues; to say that it is transformative is understatement. I had been taught in college that human evolution stopped with the advent of culture, that culture made adjustments to the environment thus eliminating the need for biology to fine tune our bodies. I had also been trained to view IQ tests as simply racist tools used by white patriarchal society to convince the priveleged that minority people are inferior - it sounds hyperbolic but I was actually told this by professors! I had also been taught that all humans are essentially the same (one world, one people, that race is only skin deep). When confronted with differences in intelligence, adaptability, etc. I was taught that this is due to political inequities, war, in short, culture. This book challenges these biases. I will no doubt read this book again at some later date and refer to it from time to time. I am not trained as a scientist so I will have to review and re-review the data from time to time. I was trained as a social scientist - cultural anthropology - so I am the target audience for this book. The issue regarding Neanderthals and what became of them is one of the first issues undertaken in this work; I found it to be both realistic and reasonable. The authors rely on population genetics, mathematics, extrapolations, &c in an effort to buttress their position that modern humans have inherited a small but important percentage of Neanderthal genetic material. It makes sense to me.Among so many things, I admire the authors for having the courage to challenge our current received wisdom. It seems to me that they have taken quite a risk in doing so as there is nothing 'politically correct' about this book. The authors even point to data that most writers shy away from as it may cast them in a negative light. Whatever the reason for shying away from data, it is vital that we humans look facts straight in the face and deal with the realities of our evolution, our cultural wisdom and ethnocentricities, and our impact upon this planet. At the minimum, debate these issues rather than labeling and dismissing them. This book tackles a few of these issues."
273,0465002218,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4534780-alina,5,"The old thinking is that, when cultural evolution took off, biological evolution stopped -- because instead of being shaped by our environment, we began shaping our environment to us. That idea always seemed reasonable to me, but this book has changed my mind. The authors contend that, on the contrary, evolution has sped up since the neolithic revolution. The social innovations associated with agriculture and civilization mean we have subjected ourselves to major new environmental pressures, and that has fueled rapid natural selection. Their idea is that cultural evolution interacts with biological evolution; the two drive each other. One of the book's points is that natural selection isn't as slow as is often believed, since altering just one gene or even one nucleotide can sometimes result in important advantages. By examining evidence from the exploding field of population genetics, as well as other sources, the authors find indications of significant biological change in the past 10,000 years or so. Examples include differing disease resistance in response to local conditions, the development of lactose tolerance in dairy farmers, and selection for higher intelligence among Ashkenazi Jews. Although I'd heard of some of these things before, I hadn't appreciated the impact on history. The authors make a convincing case that genetic factors can be decisive. I no longer think of biological evolution as something that stopped being important once modern humans came into existence."

那么为何德系犹太人特别聪慧呢？想要解答这个谜题，或许我们可以看看关于阿什肯纳兹犹太人的DNA我们都知道些什么，因为事实证明它们还有另一个有趣的特征。即，它们有一组不常见的严重遗传病，例如家族性黑蒙性痴呆症、高雪氏病、家族性自主神经功能异常，以及两种不同形式的遗传性乳腺癌（BRCA1和BRCA2），这些疾病在阿什肯纳兹犹太人群体中的发病率比在其他欧洲人群中高将近100倍。我们相信这两个谜题有单一的解释。我们认为阿什肯纳兹犹太人在北欧逗留的时期在白领职业的自然选择中获得了成功，而这成功源自他们智力上的遗传优势。但对于智力的强势选择也产生了一些让人不愉快的副作用：提高遗传携带者智商的等位基因同时也对纯合体产生损害。这一类解释自然是有争议的。事实上很多人排斥这一类说法：智力是可测量的，由遗传决定的，不同的人类群体间有智力上的差异。有趣的是，这些批评和斥责甚少来自从事认知测试及其结果分析的科学工作者。业内对此很少或几乎没有任何争议，智商测试是准确的，测试结果能预测学术成就和个体生活的其他方面，而且智商值有极高的遗传率。如果遗传的确能影响智力，那么一段时间后，智力带来的繁殖优势必然会带来更高的智力。这个简单的逻辑是关于自然选择的演化理论的核心：能增加繁殖的基因在人类群体中会随时间推移变得越来越常见。.................我们认为印欧扩张起始于乳糖耐受突变的频率增高，当其频率增高至足以使整个人群转型从事制乳业经济的时候，印欧人就迅速扩散至整个南俄大草原。这迅速的扩张就有可能导致说近似语言的同一人群分散在从当今的乌克兰直到乌拉尔河地区这一广阔区域。因为扩张如此迅速，语言还没有分化，所以这一广大区域中分散的人群说的还是相似的语言。印欧人前进的步伐持续至进入欧洲，在那里制乳业在生态学效应上足以跟早期农业竞争，而且前者催生了一种远远更具侵略性的文化。印欧文化很可能是更好战的，因为印欧人群的高机动性、更多的人口数量和更好的营养使他们能比其他人群更经常赢得战争。而他们的胜利反过来又会提升他们的军事行动效率，从而成功哺育了更多成功。从印欧人基因在欧洲基因库占的相对低的比例来看，他们似乎实行的是精英统治，做被征服人群的统治者但没有摧毁或替代原先的居住者。然而相对小的精英人口常常能够让所有其余人口说他们的语言。此外，印欧人还把乳糖耐受的等位基因加进了本地的混合基因库。乳糖耐受突变在印欧人入侵前的欧洲很罕见或根本不存在，然而当制乳业受自然选择青睐的时候，它就在欧洲变得很常见了，特别是在北欧。[20]印欧语言和文化在制乳业流行的地域传播扩散，比方说，它们还进入了南欧和伊朗，然而中东的强势国家们似乎阻止了这些语言文化进入中东。我们认为印欧扩张起始于乳糖耐受突变的频率增高，当其频率增高至足以使整个人群转型从事制乳业经济的时候，印欧人就迅速扩散至整个南俄大草原。这迅速的扩张就有可能导致说近似语言的同一人群分散在从当今的乌克兰直到乌拉尔河地区这一广阔区域。因为扩张如此迅速，语言还没有分化，所以这一广大区域中分散的人群说的还是相似的语言。印欧人前进的步伐持续至进入欧洲，在那里制乳业在生态学效应上足以跟早期农业竞争，而且前者催生了一种远远更具侵略性的文化。印欧文化很可能是更好战的，因为印欧人群的高机动性、更多的人口数量和更好的营养使他们能比其他人群更经常赢得战争。而他们的胜利反过来又会提升他们的军事行动效率，从而成功哺育了更多成功。从印欧人基因在欧洲基因库占的相对低的比例来看，他们似乎实行的是精英统治，做被征服人群的统治者但没有摧毁或替代原先的居住者。然而相对小的精英人口常常能够让所有其余人口说他们的语言。此外，印欧人还把乳糖耐受的等位基因加进了本地的混合基因库。乳糖耐受突变在印欧人入侵前的欧洲很罕见或根本不存在，然而当制乳业受自然选择青睐的时候，它就在欧洲变得很常见了，特别是在北欧。[20]印欧语言和文化在制乳业流行的地域传播扩散，比方说，它们还进入了南欧和伊朗，然而中东的强势国家们似乎阻止了这些语言文化进入中东。.......一开始他们是作为基督教与穆斯林世界的中介的国际商人。然而随着穆斯林和基督徒（特别是意大利人）逐渐开始直接通商，阿什肯纳兹犹太商人越来越多地开始从事本地贸易。当对犹太人的迫害越来越严重从而长距离旅行无法得到安全保障之后，德系犹太人越来越专注于金融业，这个行业对他们是敞开的，因为基督徒被禁止放高利贷。在公元1100年前绝大部分德系犹太人都是放贷者，这一模式延续了几个世纪。[15]这些职业（交易和金融业）有很高的智商需求，我们可以肯定没有其他人类群体有这么高数量比例的人口在长时段内从事需要很高认知能力的职业。有时我们能找到相当详尽的阿什肯纳兹犹太人的商业活动记录。比如关于南法鲁西永犹太人在约公元1270年就有这样的记录：“有全面证据证明这群犹太人以放贷为生，实质上完全没有从事任何其他种类的经济活动。有记录的228名男性犹太人中近八成在向他们的基督教邻居放贷。犹太女人（几乎都是寡妇）放贷的也很常见，这些来自弱势者的资本被投资到相似的渠道。并且最积极从事放贷的犹太人似乎在他们的群体内是最受尊崇的。................他们曾是波兰立陶宛王国的管理者阶层。除了读写能力之外，在这些特定职业上取得成功所依靠的是类似于现今商人的素质，至少也需要有追踪复杂交易和资金流动的能力。最终，随着波兰立陶宛王国的阿什肯纳兹犹太人人口数量上升，越来越多的犹太人成了手工艺者——毕竟对管理和金融职业的需求也是有一定限度的。然而在800到900年的时间段内，也就是大致从公元800年到公元1650或1700年，绝大部分的阿什肯纳兹犹太人从事的是管理和金融业，也就是复杂度很高的职业，他们几乎从来不当农民和匠人。在这个方面他们和所有其他定居人口都有所不同。事实上，在那个时代任何占有领地的人类族群都不可能有那么高比例的人口从事白领职业，因为这样农业生产率就会过低。九成的人口都必须务农，从而生产足够的粮食去养活他们自己和社会顶层少量的统治者、文员、士兵、匠人以及商人。对白领职业的自然选择只有在这一阶层独自成为一个族群的时候才有可能成功，这一族群必须靠职业而非其据地而界定。在高复杂度职业中取得成功的犹太人享有更高的遗传优势。学者怀里波说：“在富裕的家庭中有更多的孩子能活到成年。总体上属于更富裕阶层的许多商业领袖、显赫拉比、群体领袖和类似个体的谱系显示，这些人通常有4个、6个甚至8～9个孩子活到成年。........智商有很高的可遗传性。这意味着一个个体的智商值会部分取决于遗传影响，从而更接近他或她的父母和兄弟姐妹而不是随便哪个别人。同一对父母生下的子女即便在不同环境下养大也会有相近的智商值，而领养的兄弟姐妹即便在同一屋檐下长大也不会有相近的智商值。高度也是类似的：长得高的人更可能有高于平均身高的子女。事实上，成年人的智商值与身高一样主要受遗传因素影响。然而童年的智商值却受遗传影响更少，而更容易受周围环境影响。周围环境对儿童智商测试结果的影响会在青春期期间或其后消失，这成了美国先锋计划（Head Start Program）的基础，即宣扬智商值能因一定干预而提高。非遗传因素同样会影响智商值，但很多情况下那些起作用的因素都不是人们想象会起作用的因素。父母关爱、母乳喂养、营养情况、早教、子宫中听莫扎特音乐和燕麦麸几乎都没起什么作用。而让人惊讶的是，一个家庭养育孩子的方式看起来对孩子成年时的智商值没有任何影响。这有效地反驳了一些流行的环境决定论——它们对阿什肯纳兹犹太人的高智商做各种成长环境方面的解释，尤其反驳了那些认为犹太母亲用特殊的方式抚养孩子催发了他们的高智商的论调。...在阿什肯纳兹犹太人特别高发的遗传病中，广为人知的是家族性黑蒙性痴呆症、高雪氏病和BRCA1与BRCA2乳腺癌突变，但同时还有许多其他的疾病，比如尼曼匹克症、卡纳万病和家族性自主神经功能异常。有些会引起神经方面的问题。它们在阿什肯纳兹犹太人身上特别高发，这已经成了人类遗传学上一个长久的谜题。.....是什么样的性征在阿什肯纳兹犹太人身上比在他们的邻居身上更宝贵呢？嗯，我们有一些很强的线索。是什么性征在当今的德系犹太人身上最突出呢？他们是壮大如萨摩亚人，高如图西族人，以及牛奶耐受如荷兰人吗？不是的，他们的特殊性征就是智力。这些突变体本身就提示了这一点：它们中的一些看起来就很像会提高智商的，考虑到它们作用于中枢神经系统的发展。鞘脂类突变体特别有可能具有提升智力的作用。在每一种这类突变体中，都有一些特定鞘脂累积；这些鞘脂是变更过的脂类分子，它们在信号传输中起作用，并在神经组织中特别常见。研究者已经确定这些鞘脂类作用水平的提升会引致神经元（中枢神经系统的基本细胞）之间更多的连接（高雪氏病的轴突生长）。在家族性黑蒙性痴呆症的情形中有相似的效应：特定的累积混合物（GM2神经节苷脂）作用水平提升会促进树突（连接神经元的纤细多分支突起）的增长。[41]这种树突生成的增加现象也同样发生在A型尼曼匹克细胞出现、动物版黑蒙性痴呆症和尼曼匹克病的情形下。这些都是已知的疾病等位基因中唯一能引致神经连接增加的因素。我们同时还有（并不确凿的）证据证明德系犹太人身上常见的一些基因变异有可能提升智力。我们研究了耶路撒冷高雪氏病患者的职业——实际上是所有在耶路撒冷沙尔泽德克医学中心（Shaare Zedek Medical Centre）治疗的患者。这些患者成为工程师或科学家的概率比以色列阿什肯纳兹犹太人从事这些职业的平均概率要高很多，事实上大概要高11倍。[42]关于阿什肯纳兹犹太人的另一种遗传病扭转性肌张力障碍也有类似的研究结果。这种遗传病最初被诊断出来的时候，研究者就已经开始注意到其患者不同寻常的智力水平。.....结论文化革新在很长的时间里都是人类生物学变化的驱动力，在约250万年前人类开始使用工具之后就一直如此。自然选择青睐那些从事早期文化革新的原始人类大脑，而这些革新本身就导向更多身体和心理上的变化。生物学特征和文化特征的协同演化一开始是很缓慢的，至少以现代标准看是慢的，但渐渐演化速度就快起来了。考古学记录显示我们的革新能力持续上升，直至约4万年前，我们已经为所谓的“人类革命”或旧石器时代晚期欧洲和亚洲北部的“创造性大爆发”蓄势待发。技术和艺术的突然兴盛发生在人类扩张并走出非洲的不久以后；它同时也跟生物学变化有关，而我们猜想这些生物学变化部分是由从尼安德特人或其他远古人类（亚洲大陆更早的占据者）身上偷得的基因驱动的。行为现代化导致更多的变化：人类制作更精良的工具，然后他们在数代人的时间里也反过来被这些工具不断塑造变化。农业出现之后，文化和生物演化都加速了，因为新的生活方式使人们有了新的需求。农业出现以前人类一直都是觅食者：农业带来的人口急剧增加使得更多有益的变异体出现，也使得更多新想法出现。我们人类在农业传播后的快速演化的确是一万年的爆发。 这爆发如今还在持续：人类演化并没有止步于解剖学意义上的现代人类出现，或他们扩张走出非洲的时候。它从来没有停止。而且它怎么会停下呢？演化停滞需要一个静滞的环境，而行为现代化一直带来的都是革新和变化。一直以来我们都不曾有稳定和静滞的环境。这一点应该是很明显的，然而人类科学不仅忽视了它，相反还一直在一个奇怪的前提下辛勤地做研究，这个奇怪的想法认为演化在4万年前就停止了。 所有这些都意味着也必然意味着，生物变化是驱动历史的重要因素。当然它不是唯一的因素，而且很奇怪的是，它还被与更传统的影响绑定在一起。诸如乳糖耐受一类的遗传变化的出现和传播是文化革新（例如农业的发展）的结果，它同时也源自随机出现的合适的突变。这些遗传变化反过来也对文化产生了影响。印欧人的扩张，欧洲人在北美和澳大利亚的成功定居，“瓜分非洲”的失败，阿什肯纳兹犹太人进入智力舞台，甚至有可能工业革命和科学的兴起，所有这些看来都是生物和文化变化之永恒的舞步所营造的。 如果人类科学的研究者们继续忽略自然选择从未停止作用这一事实，他们就会把许多重要问题的解答线索给丢掉，把谜题变成秘密。科尔特斯带着500人就征服并控制了几百万人的帝国。想要解释这件事情而不提持续演化带来的疾病抵御机制中的生物学差异，这完全不可能。公元前5世纪的修昔底德说人类特征是不会变化的，所以可以预测，而当今许多科学家相信人类特征几万年前就停止了改变。历史学家们似乎一直以此为研究的前提。然而这样一来他们就忽略了巨大的契机，不仅在于解读人类的往昔，而且也在于塑造未来。贯穿人类历史的持续演化一直是一个巨大的自然界的实验，这个实验承诺了我们在理解自身、抵御疾病和精神病症方面的巨大的成果。利莫内苏尔加尔达隐藏着关于人类疾病的一个重要线索。世界上大概有100万个这样的小村庄，一定有更多类似的线索等待我们去发现。人类历史为我们展现的一些实验的成果甚至有可能帮助我们进行更有野心的尝试，去增加人类寿命和认知能力。从事人类科学的学者们是时候去甩掉一系列关于演化停止和“心理均一”的僵化教条了。每一刻时间都很宝贵，我们有一整个世界要去争取呢。"
275,0465002218,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16831597-fran-globlek,4,"The authors manage to spoil many thought-provoking observations with a careless approach to logic and underwhelming scientific rigour. I will give it 4/5 on account of me enjoying the ideas. These ideas, however, convince me to the extent of them ""making sense"". As a scientist I do expect much more in order to be convinced. I understand that this would make the book significantly longer and it might not necessarily be aimed for the ""general public"", but I would argue that here we don't really see the case of oversimplification being the issue, since the ideas, terminology, methodology described etc. are not necessarily ""dumbed down"". Instead, there is a certain haughty attitude - judging by this book alone, everybody other than the authors thinks genetic changes in human beings stopped 40,000 years ago and is wholly dogmatic. "
276,0465002218,http://goodreads.com/user/show/77887124-paul-clark,1,"This book rejects the view that race is primarily a social construct and proposes five hypotheses about genetic differences between ethnic groups. The first two, lactose tolerance and resistance to pathogens, are physiological and uncontroversial. The same cannot be said of the other three: that interbreeding between Eurasians and Neanderthals increased Eurasian intelligence, that long-term exposure to agriculture leads to a greater predisposition to the ‘bourgeois’ values of hard work and restraint, and that medieval restrictions on Ashkenazi Jews raised their intelligence. This review will focus on these three hypotheses.THE NEANDERTHAL ADVANTAGEHomo sapiens first encountered Neanderthals after leaving Africa 40,000 years ago. Cochran and Harpending speculate that interbreeding between the two species raised Eurasian intelligence, triggering the Upper Palaeolithic revolution in technology, symbolic behaviour and socio-economic organisation. Quite how sub-Saharan Africans later managed the same transition to modern behaviour without the benefit of Neanderthal DNA, the authors do not say.In any case, many archaeologists favour non-genetic explanations for the transition. Others argue that it occurred in Africa much earlier, citing discoveries like a large 70,000 year-old settlement in Sudan and sophisticated 44,000 year-old southern African artefacts. If critics of the Upper Palaeolithic model turn out to be correct, Cochran and Harpending’s highly speculative hypothesis would be falsified.THE AGRICULTURAL REVOLUTION AND BOURGEOIS VALUESThe authors claim that the development of agriculture led to the spread of genes for hard work and restraint among those populations in the Middle East, East Asia and Europe that have been exposed to agriculture for longest.Whilst superficially convincing, their account has serious flaws. The most glaring is the claim that ADHD has been bred out of China, where it actually affects up to 5% of schoolchildren. Other claims presented as facts are in reality matters of dispute. Agriculture might have arisen in sub-Saharan Africa 1,000 years earlier than the authors state, and their claim that Australian Aborigines never developed agriculture is contested.In most pre-capitalist societies, hard work did not have the significance the authors give it because any attempt to rise above your station was seen as sinful and peasants generally did as little work as they could get away with. The way people accumulated wealth was to squeeze it out of someone else as a warlord, a landlord or the holder of a sinecure that enabled them to milk others.Traders who acquired wealth through hard work dreamed of turning it into land, finding an impoverished noble family to marry into and putting their feet up. The only ones unable to do this were religious minorities like Armenians, Jews, Lebanese and Parsees. Cochran and Harpending claim that bourgeois genes made these communities successful middlemen when in fact it was their minority religion that trapped them in this niche.Similarly dubious is the claim that a lack of bourgeois genes fuels opposition to neo-liberalism in Latin America. Surely the growth of the industrial working class is a better explanation for the influence of socialism there.The authors contrast farmers who refrain from eating their seed corn with hunter gatherers who scupper efforts to turn them into herders by eating all their goats. But are hunter gatherers really so stupid? Or is this a case of a top-down innovation deliberately sabotaged by a community that never wanted it?The claim that aggression has been bred out of those populations longest exposed to agriculture is undermined by Cohen and Nisbett’s famous study that found startling differences in levels of aggression between genetically indistinguishable people from different cultures.THE INTELLIGENCE OF AHKANAZI JEWSCochran and Harpending’s third controversial hypothesis concerns the high IQs of Ashkenazi Jews, allegedly 12-15 points above other Europeans. They favour the theory that this is genetically determined because medieval north European Jews were restricted to white-collar occupations, particularly money lending, in which only intelligent people could succeed, giving them greater reproductive success in a community where marrying out was forbidden.However, the data they present is superficial. The influence of heritability on IQ shifts during a person’s life, rising dramatically as children grow to adulthood. But the authors never give the ages of the people in their statistics, making them impossible to assess.Their claim that 80% of economically active medieval Ashkenazim were full-time moneylenders is unconvincing, since Jews were confined to ghettoes with separate micro-economies, and rules forbidding the ‘improper subordination’ of Christians by Jews would probably have created the need for a Jewish servant class.Despite these caveats, this hypothesis is credible if unproven. There is no a priori reason why the heritable intelligence of every ethnic group should be the same and the Ashkenazim are a genetically closed community with a unique history.CONCLUSIONSThe 10,000 Year Explosion makes noteworthy points about physiological differences between the races and asks an interesting question about the intelligence of Ashkenazi Jews without quite supplying the answer. But it has conspicuously failed to demonstrate any other link between race and either intelligence or character. Cochran and Harpending’s Neanderthal hypothesis is highly speculative, and their claims about bourgeois values and agriculture rest on questionable evidence and a willingness to ignore simpler and more obvious explanations.Please see my website for a longer and fully sourced version of this review."
277,0465002218,http://goodreads.com/user/show/84499280-david-baer,4,"I got worried reading the introduction, because (among many others) they thanked Phil Rushton, who I remember from a lifetime ago as being in the news in a bad way, as in using his research to either promote or implicitly support racist ideologies. But I continued anyway, because I find the subject matter fascinating.Because, as I opined in my review of Before the Dawn: Recovering the Lost History of Our Ancestors, it's not by definition racist to inquire into the genetic basis of racial variation - it's only racist if you use such inquiry to justify privilege for one group, or even to consider one group as inherently superior to another. So, for example, it's not racist to find the genetic basis for why Kenyans are so successful at long-distance running. It is racist to conclude from that fact, that, I don't know, say, ""driving while black"" isn't really a thing. Or that separation of the ""races"" is a good thing, etc etc.This book isn't racist, in my opinion - but I understand how it could come off as such. The thing about Ashkenazi Jews having enhanced intelligence has a certain taint to it, because it's been used to justify (racist) hierarchies of the ""races"". And this thing about the Ashkenazi Jews comes up again and again: because they experienced unique conditions of repression in northern Europe for a thousand years, those who could really be successful in intellectually challenging roles such as (principally) money-lending, were more reproductively successful. So there is a lot of evidence presented, and I buy it, and I don't believe I am racist for buying it, but still - there are a lot of racists who also buy it, and that makes me a bit uncomfortable.Even though the book has a lot of footnotes and a good bibliography, I felt the authors did a poor job of constructing arguments. It seemed they were all over the place, all the time - promising answers and then discursively wandering away from what they promised to answer, never getting back to it. Like on page 91 we are told ""we now understand quite a bit about the genetic changes that led to light skin in northern Eurasians."" Wow! That's a big statement; I was prepared for a big explanation. But a dozen pages of stuff later, they were moving on to another topic; I carefully re-read the intervening pages, which were all quite interesting, but I confirmed that they definitely never delivered on their promised explanation of skin color.I give it 4 stars because I love the subject matter and am fascinated by the implications of the fact that all modern people emerged from a small African population of humans who lived about 50kya. Our written history is so microscopic compared to all of what must have happened - just to know what we can infer from genetics to fill in the blanks is amazing. Unfortunately racists will also find much to love in this book; I can't help that and it's not the fault of the authors either."
278,0465002218,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50953703-groot,5,"The rate of human evolution has accelerated radically over the last 10,000 years. This takes a genetic perspective on history and archaeology, benefiting from the vast improvement in the science and technology of genomic knowledge. Organisms, including people, adapt to changing environments, and our environment is changing radically, starting with the Upper Paleolithic, the introduction of farming, settling into towns, domesticating animals (including milk-yielding species), the vast increase in the number of humans and consequent breeding ground for infectious diseases, literacy and numeracy and their contribution to human prospering for those that could excel at them, and so on. A fascinating book, with some safe and interesting insights, but not shying away from more controversial hypotheses, such as the contributions of proto-humans, such as Neanderthals and Denisovans, to modern humans, with their longer-term adaptations to living in northern climes, possibly contributing lighter skin and other features."
279,0465002218,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40298632-joe-q,4,"This book cogently argues that, rather than ending with the dawn of modern Homo sapiens, evolution has been continuing apace over the last 10,000 years. Arguments from natural selection are used to explain patterns in world history, including Europeans' success in displacing Amerindians in the Americas and their failure to displace Africans in the tropical parts of that continent. It's a quick read, and very enlightening.While the authors make their case very clearly, I would have liked to see them explore whether modern medical science -- or demographics in general -- has weakened the link between ""reproductive fitness"" and actual numbers of descendants. Given that so much infectious disease can be treated or controlled, quality food and good sanitation are abundant, and many very ""reproductively fit"" people choose to have small families (or none at all), does their thesis still apply? Will the next 10,000 years be like the last 10,000 were?"
280,0465002218,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70611546-kevin,2,"According to this book, conventional evolutionary psychology claims that we became adapted to the savannah after spending hundreds of thousands of years other. The tens of thousands of years since we left Africa were not enough for evolution to do anything more than tweak us around the edges and the time since the agricultural revolution is a mere blink of an evolutionary eye and human evolution has more or less slowed to a crawl.The 10,000 Year Explosion is evolutionary psychology dialed up to 11. Rather than slowing down, evolution has actually sped up. Genetic change was responsible not just for the agricultural revolution but the scientific and industrial revolutions too, not to mention the rise and fall of empires. Examples of candidate mutations abound. The sum of the books arguments, though was unconvincing. "
281,0465002218,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46659477-atalay-oral,5,"The ""Aha"" per page of this book is unrivaled in comparison to the ubiquitous sophistry of the social sciences. With a firm root in evolutionary theory, Cochran and Harpending convinces anyone who isn't blind or an absolute idiot about the impossibility of evolutionary pressures on humans halting to a stop. The authors lays out evolutionary thinking in such a way that the reader will by the end of the book feel a lot more confident in her understanding of the world. It should truly be read by everyone.The book can be read by anyone without any prior knowledge on evolutionary theory. The minimum level of the book is high-school. This due to the authors' superior skill in laying out and explaining every phenomenon in the most simple manner. "
282,0465002218,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49654956-gerald-mclaughlin,4,"One among several books that attempts to describe recent human evolution, with attention to the long-known mutations associated with malaria resistance, lactose tolerance, alcohol tolerance, and other simple mutations. The concept of a variant on 'artificial selection' as is observed for dogs and other domesticated animals and plants, seems suggested although not explicit. This seems based on advantages for particular populations, with more offspring among those with particular genetic traits and cultural adaptations such as herding, farming, urbanization, domestic animals such as horses, and improved military weaponry. Pretty persuasive that the process seems ongoing."
283,0465002218,http://goodreads.com/user/show/553795-nemo,5,I like its starting chapters immediately about how evolution made huge apperance difference in wild animals and domesticated animals in just a short period of time. Then the modern human out of africa confonrting Neaderteals is also interesting. Then I brought the book with me on my trips to Chengdu with parents and reading became on and off and hard to concentrate. So the middle part of the book is a bit lost to me. Then I returned home and read the last chapter about why a branch of Jews (German Jews) are super smart while bearing more genetic diseases really really interesting and I learned a lot. This last chapter alone make the book deserve a 5 star.

Apparently they started being able to drink milk real good and everybody started talking like them. It's science. This book didn't blow my friggin mind or nothing, but presented the findings in an easy to digest manner (albeit with some eye rollingly bad jokes here and there), and the studies provide enough ideas to ruminate over while taking a dump and posting book updates online."
285,0465002218,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5560994-patrick-fay,3,"A very interesting concept and one that I agree is almost certainly correct- natural selection and biological differences among people have had a large effect on human history- these biological processes are ongoing and likely increasing in speed due to sweeping changes to the environment and selective pressures. But for an idea this controversial, the book did not provide enough evidence. The evidence may exist, but the support provided here felt weak."

Obviously I do see some role for culture to play, but the arguments for the power of genetics via marginal advantage and genetic fixation were powerful. Definitely an important, though underrated book. As with any book, I did have differences, but if you are interested in the social sciences, you should not do yourself the disservice of not reading this book (all the way through.)"

296,0465002218,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12991284-jeremy,3,"As a long time reader of science books I was immediately attracted to this book due to its great title – titles are important, take note publishers. The last science book I read was the great The Fifth Miracle by Paul Davies, which was an examination of how life evolved. Cochran and Harpending’s book promised an argument against the long held theory that humans stopped evolving fifty thousand years ago, just after emerging out of Africa. The book describes itself as the “…the latest edition to the fast emerging discipline of biohistory.” There’s been quite a bit of news related to this area lately, so I thought that it was time to give it a read.The book opens with a refutation of “conventional wisdom”, with the authors claiming that human evolution has accelerated in the last ten thousand years due to various selection pressures, such as agriculture, geographic expansion and climate change. They go on to examine the period that started fifty to forty thousand years ago when modern humans moved into the European territories of the Neanderthal. Ten thousand years later the Neanderthal were extinct and humans were flourishing. No one knows for sure but it seems that humans displayed better adaptations such as advanced language, tools and hunting techniques. There is convincing genetic evidence that we interbreed with Neanderthals and picked up and kept various advantageous genes – just ask Ozzy Osbourne. The ensuing four chapters examine the impact of the advent of agriculture some ten thousand years ago and how the changes to what we ate affected our genetic makeup; the genetic flow of humanity as expressed by selective sweeps of particular genes and also the impact of expansion on humans throughout the globe. A succinct summary - but if you want to know the facts then read the book! But is it worth reading?The ideas presented in The 10,000 Year Explosion are certainly well argued. The authors blend history, archaeology, paleontology and biology to weave their arguments convincingly. They refer to their work as “genetic history” – a “new kind of history.” This is all very well but unfortunately the flaw of this book is that the writing style is relatively bland. There is an effort to engage and give the facts some personality, but as interested as I was in the arguments presented I often found myself bored. I believe that writing popular science is a tricky thing, because, after all, you don’t want to dumb it down; but also you don’t want to put the average reader off either. After reading this book I appreciate science writers such as Paul Davies and Marcus Chown for their efforts to both explain and engage.The 10,000 Year Explosion ends with a case study of the Ashkenazi Jews – Jews that were confined to Europe from medieval times and that were restricted to money lending and clerical professions; the kind of jobs that required a certain level of intelligence. The combination of the demands of their profession and their tendency to marry within their faith meant that the European Jews were selected for a higher intelligence than Jews in the Middle East. Five hundred or so years later descendants of this group were making the major scientific breakthroughs throughout many disciplines and they also displayed higher IQs than other groups. A fascinating case study, but once again the bland writing created a nagging sense of boredom.The story of human evolution is an amazing tale to behold - one that’s obsessed me on and off for years. It’s compelling, fascinating and most of all it’s our story. Unfortunately this book does not really capture the sense of wonder that our story can engender, which is a shame. Read this book if you want the facts, but perhaps look elsewhere if you want to feel that elusive sense of wonder. Although I was slightly disappointed overall, the one interesting thing this book did do for me was to make me ponder just how our present point in human evolutionary history will be viewed in five hundred years; and that’s not such a bad thing."
297,0465002218,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17431775-schwarzenberger,3,"Considering the subject matter, it is a light read with a lot of little tidbits thrown in about how many relatives Genghis Khan has that are still living across central Asia, how disease really helped Pizarro and only 168 soldiers tear apart the Inca Empire, where blue eyes originated, and other such scientific matters that make great dinner conversation and cocktail party opening lines.By the way, i like the cover with the almost stroboscopic depiction of evolutionary influenced skeletal uprightness and locomotion. It is a grabber of a design that gets your eye from across the floor of the library or bookshop.The authors may not like this, but I am giving away a highly kept secret they mention in the index--Yes I actually do read indices, to me they give a sense of the real core of a book and let you know what the authors think is really important. If you have limited time perusing the index gets you right to the action. Well, in the index there is an entry--Lost Dutchman Mine, location, 400. I guess this means that one or both of the authors knows where this reputedly amazingly rich gold mine is hidden. It is a legend in its own right, I'm sure there are some good books about it and Wikipedia says people are still looking for it. The authors know where it is and they are telling you. It is all on page 400! However, my paperback edition (2010) only has 288 pages including the index. It's a wonderfully hidden joke that I did not see mentioned in any other review. I guess we'll have to wait another 10,000 years for the ""20,000 Year Explosion"" followup edition that will explain how humans have evolved since the demise of print books, audio CDs, broadcast television, sidewalks and other signs of civilization. Hopefully this newer edition will have a page 400.To me this was a fascinating read. ""Explosion"" discusses human genetics and evolution, a subject that I have found interesting for a long time but have not actually had the patience to really delve into in order to get a comprehensive basis for true knowledge--I feel that it would take a little more time than I want to dedicate to find out more about organic chemistry and processes of how organic molecules act and react with other to make up DNA mechanisms, and how that affects how life works etc. I did tackle ""The Eight Day of Creation"" some decades ago...what I read of it was fascinating but then life's personal activities got in the way. But the thing that really stopped me was that I kept the used copy (It cost only 1 dollar) of the book I bought on a back shelf for about 10 years and then when I finally started reading it and got a little more than half way through--it is an 800 page monster--I realized that it was mis-bound and many pages were duplicated but also very mixed up and completely out of order. More importantly, a lot was missing overall and the local library didn't have a copy that that could be loaned out to read. I was not going to sit in the library and work my way through it. So basically, that's now where I left my knowledge of genes and DNA and alleles and the mechanics of genetics.That said, I did appreciate the simplification in general that the authors made to get their point across. That point is that we are still evolving, our physiology is still reacting to the environment around us trying to adapt us in the best way possible to allow for species survival and thriving. It's a good read and will get me to read more about this subject. Parts of their theses reminded me of Julian Jaynes' book with that wonderful title--""The Development of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind"" and his theory that we humans finally realized that it wasn't the Gods talking to each and every one of us, it was just our brains finally melding messages together across the corpus callosum inside each of our skulls."
298,0465002218,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1219617-erik,3,"Cochran and Harpending dispel the long-held scientific notion that human evolution reached a plateau tens of thousands of years ago, as well as all change has been cultural. Instead, they argue that cultural change has effected genetic change, and vice versa. Not only did agriculture select for certain characteristics – like lactose tolerance as a result of animal husbandry, for one – but so introgression with Neanderthals, which has been historically frowned upon in the scientific community due to biased in favor of the notion homo sapiens purity. ""The explosion is ongoing: Human evolution didn’t stop when anatomically modern humans appeared, or when they expanded out of Africa. It never stopped – and why would it? Evolutionary stasis requires a static environment, whereas behavioral modernity is all about innovation and change. Stability is exactly what we have not had. This should be obvious, but instead the human sciences have labored under the strange idea that evolution stopped 40,000 years ago.""One of their most controversial notions is their well-supported argument that the Ashkenazi Jews of Eastern Europe have a genetic propensity for higher intelligence as a direct result of marriage only within their community combined with societal pressures against intermarriage with gentiles, strict limitations on what kinds of white-collars jobs they could hold (banking, finance, science), and the resulting economic rewards for succeeding economically (higher birth rate, better heated homes, more personal privacy in those homes that helped thwart contact with diseases fatal to the more impoverished, etc.). All of these combined set the conditions for natural selection that resulted in a better-educated and genetically-insular population with a slightly higher-than-average IQ when compared to the other European genetic groups that they lived alongside. Perhaps this is a stretch for the politically correct crowd, but it certainly is worthy of reasoned debate and consideration. (On the flip side, Cochran and Harpending are quick to remind us that the Ashkenazi Jews also have an accompanying genetic predisposition for various diseases that other groups do not have.)As an educator, I was particularly struck by their assertion that ""Nongenetic factors also influence IQ, but for the most part, the ones that matter are not the ones people thought would matter. Prenatal care, breastfeeding, nutrition, access to early education, Mozart in the womb, and oat bran all have little or no effect. Surprisingly, the way in which a family raised children seems to have no effect on adult IQ.""Alas, neither Cochran nor Harpending go on to detail just what nongenetic factors can or do influence IQ. (I would argue that the quality of formal education be one.)On a style note, I admit to wishing several times for either Richard Dawkins or Jared Diamond’s more persuasive and personable narrative styles. (No surprise, Diamond’s Guns, Germs, and Steel and The Third Chimpanzee are both quoted numerous times.) Of course, knowing that this is the first book between the Cochran and Harpending, I imagine that they will both improve in this area in future books the co-write. "
299,0465002218,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4975079-daniel-hammer,4,"This is just the kind of exciting, accessible and provocative science that I like to read about. For the most part. Cochran and Harpending's book presents the argument that human evolution has increased in pace over the last 10,000 years. This is in contrast to a more standard view which argues that, due to the ability to culturally and technologically reshape our environment, modern human beings have less of a need to evolve biologically in response to environmental pressures. He begins with a few basics of populations genetic which support the likelihood of an increased rate of evolution in recent times. Among these are the increase in human population numbers; more people equals more chances for mutations to develop. Also important is the fact that our diets have changed more in the past 10,000 years than had hominin diets for the previous several million years. This would have introduced significant dietary pressures on us, and those who could tolerate or process certain foods (such as lactose) would be more evolutionarily successful. 10,000 years ago is a key starting point because it corresponds with the advent of agriculture, which introduced larger populations, new diets, crowded living, and more.Cochran and Harpending survey a range or very interesting ideas. They argue that humans almost definitely bred with Neanderthals. That lactose tolerance was a key to the spread of Indo-European languages, via the adaptable, milk-drinking people which spoke those tongues. They examine a number of genetic mutations which are limited to certain populations and reflect recent genetic (evolutionary) responses to environment and diet, like sickle-cell trait. They suggest that light skin color may have evolved for more than just the ability to synthesize more vitamin D, and that the human brain likely underwent important structural changes just in the past 30,000 years.All of this is seriously interesting, and a pleasure to read and debate. The downside is that Cochran and Harpending are slim on evidence for much of this. I an inclined to believe they are largely correct, but too often the book reads like a laundry list of exciting suggestions, without much to back them up.This book certainly worth a quick read and makes some great food for thought."
