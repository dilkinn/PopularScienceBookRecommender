0,1846144329,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5448792-b-schrodinger,3,"I love Brian Cox and I went to see him in a live show in Canberra at the end of October. I started this book the day before that with a huge amount of enthusiasm and excitement, but the grind soon slowed down and I finished it this afternoon.What happened?I think other reviews have summed the problem up correctly. To explain certain aspects of quantum mechanics the authors latched onto an analogy with clocks. It was fine at first and I understood what was going on. But then it was expanded upon again, and then again, oh and 100 pages later. Over time I was confused about why we were winding clocks back at this point. Does how long can you carry an analogy before it becomes easier to explain the aspect you are trying to convey from scratch? I came away with a feeling that it would have been much easier if I sat myself down with a textbook and worked through the problems sans clocks. Using an analogy so much and with so much depth was a huge risk and for me it did not pay off at all.But there is still a lot of meat to get your teeth into. It wasn't all about the clocks...not quite. I have been exposed to quantum mechanics from a chemistry viewpoint, most of my work has to do with molecular orbitals or the behaviour of electrons. So most was broadening my understanding of the subject. I don't know if I could recommend this book to many people. It's not going to be accessible to most people at all. Physicists will probably know how this works without the analogy and I'd guess other scientists or science enthusiasts may get frustrated like myself. It's a curious book which makes me wonder who the authors were intending the audience to be. "
1,1846144329,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1308238-gerald,1,"Okay... well first off I should declare that I have a degree in Quantum Physics. And that I was bought this book as a present. Its clearly trying to explain Quantum Theory for 'the layperson' - those that aren't scientists or mathematicians. That's a problem, because Quantum Theory is really rather complicated. In order to try and explain how wave addition works, the authors come up with what they obviously believe is a very straightforward mechanism to do with clocks. Only it takes them so long to explain the clock mechanism, that we've then forgotten what its for. And to be honest, I didn't understand the clocks thing anyway - and I do understand how wave addition works (so fortunately could skip this bit). But then they come back to it again and again.And despite openly saying at the beginning, 'we're not going to use many equations in this book', they've clearly completely forgotten that by halfway through, or just realised its impossible to explain complicated Physics without them.So in the end I struggled to understand everything they were talking about, in their efforts to 'dumb it down', but I suspect those efforts have failed too, because its probably more complicated to try and explain it simply than to explain it in your own language.And if anyone really doesn't like Brian Cox (I was fairly neutral on him, but am put off a little now), I don't think you'll like this much... its definitely a wee bit smug. But the main problem is obviously that it ends up being inaccessible to virtually everyone.Nice jacket though."
2,1846144329,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1651956-riku-sayuj,2,If only they could stop with their stupid clocks and use standard terminology like 'amplitude'. Why complicate such a simple concept when there is ample stuff to simplify? Bad grades for that.
3,1846144329,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36489698-r-nair,5,"This book, irrespective of the complaints from other reviewers, still deserves 5 stars just for successfully deriving Heisenberg's Uncertainty correlation from first principles and moving on from there to explain Quantum theory without using complex mathematics. This book literally walks you through the approximate derivation of the The Chandrasekhar limit (the maximum mass a white dwarf star can have) beginning from classical concepts without solving a single partial differential equation of any order. It also stops to appreciate how such an incredible truth about the Universe can be divined from just sitting down with a paper and pencil and simply thinking.I don't agree with the notion that the book is bad because it makes something obvious (like wave phase while calculating spatial probability density) complicated by doing the same with clocks. To me this is the only pop-science book I know where I have actually been intellectually taken through the development of a theory from first principles. Yes, knowing the maths that others invented for you over decades makes talking about QM easy NOW as you throw around Hamiltonians and probability densities. But what if you had to develop it from scratch as a physicist working in the 1900s? What would be your thinking process? How would you even begin to develop a theory such as this?I think this book is special because it gives the lay reader a taste of how to THINK about QM from the basics. Once you get the concept, thinking of something as a clock or an amplitude or a spin or chicken-curry for that matter is trivial."
4,1846144329,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6100646-brian-clegg,4,"Brian Cox has picked up a lot of fans (and a few parodies) for his light and fluffy 'here's me standing on top of a mountain looking at the stars' TV science shows - no doubt a fair number of them will rush out and buy his latest collaboration with Jeff Forshaw. They will be disappointed. So, I suspect, will a number of My Little Pony fans, as with its rainbow cover and glittery lettering it only needs a pink pony tail bookmark to complete the look.The reason The Quantum Universe will disappoint is not because it is a bad book. It's brilliant. But it is to Cox's TV show what the Texas Chainsaw Massacre is to Toy Story. It's a different beast altogether.As they did with their E=mc2 book, but even more so here, Cox and Forshaw take no prisoners and are prepared to delve deep into really hard-to-grasp aspects of quantum physics. This is the kind of gritty popular science writing that makes A Brief History of Time look like easy-peasy bedtime reading - so it really isn't going to be for everyone, but for those who can keep going through a lot of hard mental work the rewards are great too.More than anything, I wish this book had been available when I started my undergraduate course in physics. It would have been a superb primer to get the mind into the right way of thinking to deal with quantum physics. Using Feynman's least action/sum over paths with 'clocks' representing phase, the authors take us into the basics of quantum physics, effectively deriving Heisenberg's uncertainty principle from basic logic - wonderful.They go on to describe electron orbitals, the mechanics of electronic devices, quantum electrodynamics, virtual particles in a vacuum and more with the same mix of heavy technical arguments, a little maths (though nowhere near as much as a physics textbook) and a lot of Feynman-style diagrams and logic.The reason I think I would have benefited so much is that this book explains much more than an (certainly my) undergraduate course does. Not explaining why quantum physics does what it does - no one can do that. But explaining the powerful logic behind the science, laying the groundwork for the undergraduate to then be able to do the fancy maths and fling Hamiltonians around and such. It is very powerful in this respect and I would urge anyone about to start a physics degree (or in the early stages of one) to read it. I would also recommend it for someone who is just really interested in physics and is prepared to put a lot of work into reading it, probably revisiting some pages several times to get what Cox and Forshaw have in mind - because they don't ease up very often.What I can't do, though, is recommend this as general popular science. It isn't the kind of excellent introduction that gives you an understanding of what's going on in quantum theory, a view of the mysteries and a broad understanding of what the topic is about. This book is just too hard core. I'd suggest that 90% plus of popular science readers shouldn't touch it with the proverbial barge pole. If that sounds condescending, it isn't meant to be. Good popular science can and does have a lot more content and thought provoking meat than a typical Brian Cox TV show - but this book goes so much further still than that, inevitably limiting its audience.Review first published on www.popularscience.co.uk - reproduced with permission"
5,1846144329,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4901122-cara,1,"This book commits one of the cardinal sins of pop science, which is replacing mathematics (deemed by the authors to be too difficult for the apparently mentally deficient reader) with an analogy so tortured it ends up being far more complicated than it would have been if they had just used the damn math. As math goes, wave addition is actually pretty easy, so I have no idea why the authors thought that replacing waves with clocks and adding together the clocks was simpler. How can you add together clocks? How can a clock represent probability? Why would you use a clock when wave functions are far more easy to understand? Even if you assume that the average person is familiar with clocks and not with wave functions, they could have just spent two pages explaining wave addition instead of half the book explaining clock addition and saved us all some effort."
6,1846144329,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7070851-jakub,0,"Simply put, I cannot really comment on this book. I didn't get most of it, but I couldn't tell you if this was more my problem, or the book's problem. Historically, I have been terrible with math. This book has just enough of it to leave me feeling lost more than 50% of the time. Even when I thought I understood something, that understanding was extremely tentative. I have this sneaking suspicion that in trying to make a quantum physics book that is accessible to a layperson, while still including some mathematics (algebra, trigonometry, etc), they have written a book that is actually accessible to almost no one - too dumbed down for the math and physics types, and too much maths for the math-phobic types. But, once again, I cannot say this with a higher degree of certainty. It might have just been me."
7,1846144329,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5686119-book,5,"The Quantum Universe by Brian Cox & Jeff Forshaw“The Quantum Universe"" is the interesting book about the subatomic realm. Well known physicist and science celebrity Brian Cox along with fellow physicist Jeff Forshaw take us into the intimidating world of quantum mechanics. Using the latest in scientific understanding and creative analogies these scientists make complex topics accessible to the masses. This 272-page book is composed of the following eleven chapters: 1. Something Strange Is Afoot, 2. Being in Two Places at Once, 3. What Is a Particle? 4. Everything That Can Happen Does Happen, 5. Movement as an Illusion, 6. The Music of the Atoms, 7. The Universe in a Pin-head (and Why We Don’t Fall Through the Floor), 8. Interconnected, 9. The Modern World, 10. Interaction, and 11. Empty Space Isn’t Empty.Positives:1.	The ability of great scientists to communicate to the masses.2.	Fascinating topic in the hands of experts. Well researched and well written.3.	Finally, a book about quantum mechanics that I can comprehend and in the process I didn’t perceive it was “dumbed” down either. Most importantly, it kept my interest and I learned while doing so. Bravo!4.	Great use of charts and illustrations to assist the reader. Many concepts of physics defy common logic so the choice of sound illustrations is a must in order to understand the concepts. As an example, the use of clocks to understand particles.5.	Grounding what we know based on the best knowledge that science can offer. The authors do a wonderful job of explaining the scientific process and defining what a good scientific theory is all about.6.	This is strictly a science book. The authors are focused on quantum mechanics, not on the supernatural. In fact, the term ""God"" or ""Creator"" was never articulated!7.	Effective use of math, math is vital in understanding physics but the authors know their target audience well and provide the math necessary to enhance the level of comprehension. The authors don’t make the mistake of other books that bombard readers with esoteric equations and don’t follow up with a comprehensive narration. 8.	Great explanation of why the laws of quantum theory replace Newton’s laws.9.	The authors seamlessly capture discoveries and their discoverers throughout the book.10.	The unique characteristics of the electron, and I mean unique.11.	I'm in awe of science! It's truly amazing how a basic understanding of quantum theory can lead one to understand the observed properties of some of the most massive objects in the universe.12.	The great Richard Feynman and his contributions to quantum mechanics...the understanding of subatomic particles. ""Feynman is a second Dirac, only this time human"". A giant of the subatomic world.13.	Understanding that being counterintuitive (moving away from common experience) is common in quantum mechanics. In other words, embrace your weirdness.14.	Fascinating tidbits throughout such as it was often claimed that the youth of the scientists allowed them to free themselves of old ways of thinking and thus be able to understand the world of quantum theory. Of course there are exceptions...Schrodinger.15.	The probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics...the loss of predictive power, even Einstein was bothered with it.16.	The least action principle...a cornerstone of physics.17.	The Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle...it's amazing how being annoyed by the attention that Schrodinger received would drive a great scientist to his own version of quantum theory. We are talking about great scientists, not reality-TV stars. Goes to show that even scientists are humans too.18.	The brief history of Planck's constant. He was able to explain the black body spectrum...the rest is well, history.19.	The fascinating result of how to describe a moving particle. The de Broglie equation and how it works and wave packets. 20.	 The vastness inside an atom and what exactly is going on inside there. If you like guitars or drums this section is for you. The term quantized is music to my ears.21.	The work of physicist Wolfgang Pauli and why we don't fall through the floor. The Pauli Exclusion Principle. Great stuff.22.	The book does touch up on cosmology and you know that is always fun.23.	The periodic table an interesting narrative.24.	Atomic clusters...chemical bonding, semiconductors.25.	An appreciation for one of the most important inventions ever, the transistor. Thank you quantum theory.26.	Profound thoughts and concepts: ""Every electron in the Universe knows about the state of every other electron"". And that goes for protons and neutrons too. 27.	Understanding the utility of semiconductor materials. Who knew physics was so much fun?28.	The nature of interaction between particles. Quantum field theory and its rules.29.	Quantum electrodynamics (QED), the theory that explains how particles interact with each other and photons. Once again than you Mr. Feynman and Schwinger and company.30.	Anti-matter or an electron travelling backwards in time. Remember, embrace your weirdness. Oh and it does get weird.31.	A survey of The Standard Model of particle physics. Come on Large Hadron Collider (LHC)...32.	A list of all the known particles and if we are lucky with the aforementioned LHC certainly more will be added to the list.33.	 How modern physics aim to provide an answer to ""what is the origin of mass?"" The key...the Higgs boson, come on LHC. Branching rules.34.	An interesting Epilogue on the death of Stars. Fascinating stuff, applied science at its best. Negatives:1.	Quantum mechanics is complicated there is no ifs and buts about it. Even at the most accessible level some concepts will not be comprehended. Many concepts of physics defy common logic and so some patience is needed to go over some of the topics. 2.	The metric system is used so those of us who are a product of the American system will suffer a minor discomfort. The truth is we should have embraced the metric system but that is a tale for another day.3.	No links to speak of other than to diagrams.4.	Further reading section would have been enhanced with a complete bibliography.In summary, I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. The authors made comprehending such complex topics fun which is an accomplishment in its own right. The introductory knowledge that I have obtained by this book helps me gain a better understanding of our world. My love of knowledge is rewarded by great books like The Quantum Universe”. We know so little about world but every little bit of knowledge that we do obtain through the endeavors of science just gives me a sense of awe that no other human experience can match. The quest for knowledge is the most fulfilling journey any human can take. Do yourself a favor and don’t hesitate to get the “The Quantum Universe”.Further suggestions: ""A Universe from Nothing"" by Lawrence M. Krauss, ""About Time"" by Adam Frank, ""Death from the Skies"" by Philip Plait, ""The Grand Design"" by Stephen Hawking, and ""The Age of Everything"" by Mathew Hedman."
8,1846144329,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1598384-jim,4,"So what was the tipping point that caused me to read a popular book on Quantum Physics (QP) after years of successfully avoiding the topic ?

9,1846144329,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25942645-mark-hebwood,3,"I am, frankly, unsure how much of quantum physics can be conveyed meaningfully without a mathematical description of the subject. Brian and Jeff did a heroic job in keeping maths out of the discussion, and for the most part I think they still managed to deliver interesting insights into the nature of quantum physics. For example, the idea to replace complex numbers with clocks is actually quite clever, although I agree with most reviewers on this site that this device failed to make things easier to grasp.Also, I am not sure the clock-idea is entirely original. The authors clearly start off following an approach to quantum physics inspired by Feynman path integrals (at least that is what I thought lay buried beneath the metaphor of carrying clocks through the universe) and Feynman himself uses stopwatches to aid understanding in his own account on QED. But they do not seem to be touching on a lot of modern stuff - I am not knowledgeable enough to know for sure, but it seemed to me that Brian and Jeff put forward a reasonably dated view of the subject. I believe QED was basically formulated in the 40s, and (unless I missed it) there was nothing specific about quantum entanglement, non-locality, or QCD in the book. And although the authors seem to be embracing Feynman's path integrals, they later go back to wave functions to capture the dynamics. Finally, the title of the book suggests that Brin & Jeff favour Hugh Everett's many-world interpretation over the Copenhagen interpretation - I am not sure how that fits with Feynman's approach. So I ended up being a bit confused. The metaphors frustrated me, and I was not sure I understood where the authors stood 'philosophically' in their interpretation of the quantum world.In the end, though, I would still recommend this to those who are not yet frustrated by qualitative explanations of this complicated and anti-intuitive subject."
10,1846144329,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10449878-naomi,4,"This was an incredibly fascinating yet baffling book. I am quite ashamed to admit that I was confused by Chapter 3! The concept of tiny clocks as a method of understanding quantum waves was so abstract and unusual that I frequently had to remind myself what the clocks were actually representing. Nevertheless, I was perpetually amazed and astonished by the insights into the quantum world that this book elucidated, and I thoroughly enjoyed being forced out of my comfort zone, and having my perspectives challenged continuously. By the end of the book, I was mentally exhausted (and physically exhausted from concentrating so hard!) yet I learnt a lot of new concepts and I have become more open to new ideas and abstract ways of thinking.The authors were brilliant. One of the best things about this book was how the authors fused humour and science so that the novel was not like reading a dull, monotonous textbook, but more like talking to a knowledgeable, comprehensible friend. This increased my understanding of certain concepts and held my attention avidly.Lastly, I absolutely loved the epilogue; it brought together all the ideas learnt throughout the book to demonstrate how these quantum theories can contribute to the understanding of the universe. That, to me, is why science is so wonderful and beautiful. "
11,1846144329,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21177142-roger,1,"As I had studied quantum mechanics at university in the late 1960s as part of my chemistry degree I had a good idea what to expect from this book but, nevertheless, I found much of it very confusing. In particular, the use of the clocks, and the rules for the winding thereof, didn't help. These were supposedly introduced to avoid the use of complex mathematics but personally I would have done better struggling with the maths than trying to visualise these pesky clocks.It also seemed to me that few of the chapters summarised what had been said or drew any conclusions to pull together what had been discussed. I think that with a subject like this there needs to be some pauses to pull together the story so far to make sure that the audience is still on board. (Although who that intended audience is, I can't be sure.)I'm writing this review a couple of months after finishing the book and, to be honest, I can remember little of the book over and above what I already knew before I read it. Overall, I was expecting better than this from Brian Cox, given his renowned reputation as a television science communicator, so I wonder if having two authors isn't the root of the problem. Perhaps either author working alone would have done better than the two acting together. As it is, I've been put off reading anything else written by either of them!"
12,1846144329,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1260126-tim,2,"Probably the most annoying thing about this book is that it claims you don't need the maths to understand it, then proceeds to fill every page with maths. After one long equation filled section it rubs your face in it by saying, basically, that you needn't have bothered.With quantum physics relying so much on maths to be explained, it seems rather glib to claim you don't need to understand it, but then again how could they have sold this as a pop-science book if you needed a degree in maths to read it? I guess you'd also be left with a very thin book on quantum physics if you didn't pad it out with equations.This book seems aimless: Too complicated for the typical pop-science fans of Brian Cox, too lightweight for the kind of people who actually need to understand quantum physics. "
13,1846144329,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3536004-jenna,2,"By far NOT my favourite book on quantum physics. I found the authors difficult to follow much of the time, partially because I don't have the maths ability needed for this book. That said, I also found the writers rather boring, sadly. Usually I find this topic very exciting to read.... not this book. I found this book quite tedious and had to force myself to continue reading through the end."
14,1846144329,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3273779-mirek-kukla,4,"Overview""The Quantum Universe"" is an approachable book that attempts to explain the mathematical ideas underpinning modern quantum theory. In this regard, it is quite different than most other books of its kind. Take Brian Greene's brilliant ""The Fabric of the Cosmos,"" for instance: whereas Greene attempts to provide intuitive descriptions of quantum phenomena, Cox and Forshaw attempt to provide intuition for the mathematics of quantum theory. In other words, whereas most pop modern physics books strive to explain how the quantum world behaves, ""The Quantum Universe"" is more concerned with explaining the mathematical formalisms we use to describe quantum behavior.Complex ideas are explained by analogyIf this sounds a bit intimidating, don't worry: there's very little math to be had. As in every good science book for the masses, the authors explain by way of analogy. You're invited to think of ""quantum interference"" as water waves canceling each other out; of ""propagating probability waves"" as a set of clocks moving through space; and of logic gates in semiconducters as simple hydraulic valves. For the most part, the analogies are enlightening, and they make a lot of intuitive sense.That said, this book IS a lot more technical than most of its compatriots. If you've never picked up (and read through!) a popular presentation of modern physics, this probably isn't the place to start. The quantum world is a strange place, and you'll want to make sure you've had some exposure before you let Cox and Forshaw guide you through the particulars. On the other hand, if you've ever felt like every pop physics book tends to rehash the same analogies - and you're ready to probe a bit deeper - ""The Quantum Universe"" is a breath of fresh air.Short summary of contentAbout half of the book is spent explaining electron propagation. The authors do a great job of explaining deeply mathematical ideas without invoking any complex equations. Schrodinger’s wave equation is describe in terms of clocks: ""numbers in the complex plane"" are replaced by the ""clocks,"" complex addition amounts to ""combining clocks,"" and so. We're told to imagine a propagating probability wave (read: traveling electron) as the aggregate sum of a bunch of winding, traveling clocks, and to find the probability a certain electron will show up at a certain place, you learn to add up all of its clocks and take the height of the resulting hour hand. It all sounds pretty confusing and nonsensical, summarized in a paragraph like this, but the authors really do use this analogy to great effect.The rest of the book uses this simplified model of electron propagation to explain some pretty deep concepts. The highlight of the book comes when the authors effectively derive the Heisenberg uncertainty principle using nothing but said ""clocks"" and a clever bit of reasoning. The authors go on to explain why electrons only swirl about atomic nuclei in quantized (read: ""discrete"") energy levels; they introduce you to the Pauli exclusion principle, and use it to explain why we don't simply fall through the floor; and they attempt to convey the utility of quantum theory by explaining how it led to the development of semiconductors.ConclusionThe authors probe ambitious depths, and for the most part, they succeed. Unfortunately, they sometimes over-reach. Certain topics, it seems to me, simply cannot be penetrated without fully delving into some serious mathematics. Clocks can only do so much, and as a result, you often have no choice but simply take the authors’ word as they ask you to make one unmotivated leap of faith after another.Despite this occasional wand-waving, ""The Quantum Universe"" is a great book. Most books like it focus on describing the quantum weirdness we observe, they as such, they tend to leave you a bit bewildered. Here, Cox and Forshaw focus on explaining how it we're able to model this weirdness, and as a result, you'll leave feeling like it at least makes sense that someone out there really understands this stuff. ""The Quantum Universe"" appeals to your intuition without dumbing down its subject matter, and if you're willing to delve a bit deeper than usual - and you're still able to surface at the end - you'll come out with a profoundly deeper understanding of the weird, weird ways in which our world works.Quotes:""Quantum theory is perhaps the prime example of the infinitely esoteric becoming the profoundly useful"" (2)""The job of quantum theory should be to predict directly observable things... it should not be expected to provide some kind of satisfying mental picture for the internal workings of the atom, because this is not necessary and it may not even be possible."" (13)""We have learned that our perception that objects move smoothly from point to point is, form the perspective of quantum theory, and illusion. It is closer to the truth to suppose that particles move from A to B via all possible paths."" (90)""...point-like particles are really of no size and to as 'What happens if I split an electron in half?' makes no sense at all - there is not meaning to the idea of 'half an electron'."" (116)Appendix: what is a ""propagating probability wave""?To begin with, let's briefly talk about ""wave-particle duality."" The idea here is that electrons sometimes behave like particles, and other times behave like waves - in other words, electrons are both particles and waves. Huh?The idea that electrons are particles is fairly intuitive. It’s pretty easy to imagine an electron point orbiting an atomic nucleus. In fact, it turns out that electrons look like particles whenever they're observed: that is, we never detect electron waves. We only detect electron points.On the other hand, electrons sometimes behave like waves, in that they 'interfere' with one another. If you shoot a bunch of electrons at two tiny side-by-side holes in front of an electron-sensing plate, the electrons hit the plate in a 'striped' pattern. It's as if the electrons were waves - some entering through the right hole, and others through the left - where at some places, the waves cancel out, and at others, they combine. The end result of this ' wave interference' is the observed striped pattern.But it gets even weirder that this: apparently even a single electron interferes with ITSELF. Let’s say you shoot an electron through the two holes. Once it hits the plate on the other side, you shoot another. You repeat this for a while. At the end of this one-electron-at-a-time experiment, you'll see the same stripped pattern as before. Again, here electrons were all fired in series, and yet, at the end we observe a pattern that indicates interference.To explain this so-called double-slit experiment, we assume that a single electron is actually many places - at the same time. Essentially, we assume that an electron is a PROBABILITY wave. An electron travels as a sort of ""wave of possible electron locations."" The wave is ""highest"" at locations the electron is most likely to be found. And as soon as the wave is observed, or interacts with something, the electron simply manifests itself at a SINGLE location, where the location was picked, at random, from the probability distribution.This basically means that it makes no sense to ask ""what path did the electron take to arrive at the location of measurement""? In a sense, it took EVERY path touched by its probability wave, and in doing so, it ""interfered with itself. ""Weird? Totally. True? Almost certainly. Interesting? That’s for you to judge, but cool shit, as far as I’m concerned."
15,1846144329,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6573781-anthony,2,"First, a disclaimer. I have a degree in Physics so have studied Quantum Mechanics (QM) at degree level. Therefore I didn't read this as a lay person (it's intended target audience), so YMMV.I was hoping that if anyone could make QM accessible to the layman it would be Prof. Brain Cox. Sadly, in my opinion, this isn't the case.The book starts with a brief history of the beginning of the subject (which I found interesting), but when the author starts to describe the actual theory things start to unravel. In what I assume is an attempt to reduce the amount of maths in the book, he uses a 'clock system' to try and explain the theory. To my mind trying to explain it this way made no sense - if you don't have a solid understanding of the basics of the subject then you stand no chance of understanding the harder stuff once you reach it, and to truly understand the basics you need to understand the maths.Approximately half way through the clock system is retired and maths starts to assert itself. I could almost hear the author think 'hmmm, this clock thing isn't really working, I'm going to have to start using maths'. However by then I think it's too little too late.It wasn't all bad though; I enjoyed the last chapter on the death of stars. However overall this book reinforced my opinion that it's not possible to understand QM without a suitable high level understanding of maths (despite how elitist that may sound!)."
16,1846144329,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1411444-ed-erwin,4,"The title and cover turn me off since the title implies the many-worlds interpretation and the cat implies the Copenhagen interpretation, but luckily that isn't what this book is about. The authors endorse the many-worlds interpretation, but the issue of interpretation occupies only about 2 pages. This is about something else.They also don't spend much time on the double-slit experiment, entanglement, wave-particle duality, or any of the other old chestnuts. The main meat of this book, covering the final half of it, is the Pauli exclusion principle. This is the rule that says, basically, no two electrons in a system can be in the same quantum state. Is there really half a book's worth of stuff to say about that? Absolutely! The most common application is to electron orbitals in an atom or molecule. This simple principle (plus a few other things) gives rise to the differences between atoms of different elements, and thus to all of chemistry. It also explains the difference between conductors, insulators and semiconductors. And the emission/absorption spectra of atoms and molecules. It even explains why white dwarf stars exist, and what their maximum mass is. (An appendix contains a detailed rough sketch of how to calculate that mass. It is the only part of the book with detailed equations.)I studied the exclusion principle in school. In grad school we did the calculations for energy levels in hydrogen atoms. We did part of the calculations for energy levels in helium. We did calculations for energy levels in hydrogen molecules, demonstrating that the lower energy state causes them to form and calculating the mean distance between the nuclei those molecules. (I nearly decided to do my Ph.D. research on related computations for larger systems.) I mention this to point out that when studying this stuff in school, we tended to focus on the calculations (""Shut up and calculate!"") and not on the deeper meanings. As the two hydrogen nuclei are moved further and further apart, the influence of them on each other gets smaller and smaller until it becomes negligible for all practical purposes, so we didn't worry about it. But.... if you trust the math, and trust that the formulas are a complete description, the mutual influence, due to the exclusion principle, cannot ever actually go to zero. Even if moved to opposite sides of the galaxy, the exclusion principle still states that the electrons in those two atoms cannot have exactly the same energy levels. In fact, no two electrons in any two atoms in the entire universe can be in exactly the same state! In some sense, every electron in the universe is influenced by every other electron in the universe. That is mind-blowing and hard to believe. I pretty much expect that there is something, somewhere that we don't know yet that makes the interaction go to zero after sufficient distance, maybe due to quantization of space or who-knows-what, but based on the existing math in the existing model, that doesn't happen. Compared to an atom, white dwarf stars are huge, yet the principle clearly still applies to them.As for the subtitle ""...anything that can happen, does,"" that is referring both to the many-worlds interpretation (yuck!) and the principle of least action. It goes something like this. Newton described motion in terms of 3 laws, all of which are stated in terms of local things affecting an object at some point. But it is possible to derive those same laws by inventing (from thin air) some quantity called the action and noting that the path taken by a moving object (under appropriate conditions) can be calculated either by the laws as Newton wrote them, or by considering all possible paths that the object could take, and finding the one where the sum of the ""action"" along those paths is minimized. It is ""as if"" the object tried all the possible paths and then picked the one that took least action. In quantum mechanics, a similar action approach can be used to determine the path of a particle. We construct something called the ""path integral"" which is a pain-in-the-butt to calculate, but basically considers all the possible wave functions generated by considering the photon or electron or whatever taking every possible path to get from A to B, and add all those possibilities together and most of the wave functions cancel each other out except along one path and thus that is the path the photon or electron took. In class we treated this mostly as a computational trick, but some, including these authors treat it as actual fact: the particle really did explore all possible paths. I find that hard to accept. But the universe doesn't care what I accept, and whether real or just a computational trick, the math does generate the right answer.To avoid equations in the book, the authors describe a wave function as little clocks located at points in space, rather than using the notion of complex numbers. Some reviewers here were really turned-off by this. Initially, I was, too. The authors have to explain how to add, and eventually how to multiply, these little clocks by each other, so I thought they might as well just explain complex numbers: they aren't all that hard. But the more I think about it, the more I like the clock idea. They have to talk about these quite a lot. The word ""clock"" is one syllable, while ""complex number"" is four and ""value of the wave function"" is seven, so saying ""clock"" saves a lot of time as well as removing the need for equations. Eliminating equations helps with the tree vs. forest problem that could otherwise come up. You can focus on the big picture, and not try to deal so much with the equations. (In other words, the opposite of my college experience.)I have no idea which people will or will not get something out of this book, but it was very useful and thought-provoking for me, even though I've read and studied about QM for years.By the way, Brian Cox is apparently known from TV in Britain, but is someone I previously didn't know.Trigger warning: this book contains frequent use of the word ""learnt"" which is an accepted variant spelling, but annoying to me."

Brian Cox takes what could be classed as a complex topic and translates it into a easy to read, follow and understand topic. This book would appeal to students probably at University level, and people that are interested in the Quantum universe.

Only negative, is that the book cover is a bit plain in my opinion, other than that, a decent book. Glad I read it, learnt allot of new things from this book."

23,1846144329,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25360918-blair,3,"As in their previous book (Why Does E=mc²?), the authors are trying to address audiences with different technical backgrounds. This time, readers without a decent grounding in pre-calculus mathematics and basic physics will be lost most of the time. Even those with a science background will be lost (or confused, or disagree) at least some of the time. In common with other reviewers, I had trouble with the use of multitudes of little clocks that fill the universe to represent waves. I found myself translating them back into wave terms. I understand he is trying to avoid the differential equations that fully describe wave mechanics, but surely he could have worked with pictures of waves that interfere with each other. This makes a good half of the book more difficult to follow than it should be.I liked how he developed the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle using wave interference, despite the clocks. He did a nice job introducing us to the Standard Model using Feynman diagrams. I thought the way he describes the miracle of how fusion occurs in the sun was excellent. The final chapter uses the concepts developed in the book, including the fundamental constants, to describe how stars collapse. Although the math in that chapter is quite complex, at least it did not need those damned clocks. Now, lets talk about some of the problems.He tells us that the real statement of relativity is that information cannot exceed the speed of light? I thought relativity was about mass interacting with space-time, as he explained it in his previous book. How do you even physically represent the concept of information?The Pauli Exclusion Principle means that two particles (fermions) with the same quantum state cannot exist in the same place, because their wave functions will interfere with each other. This is why all the electrons in an atom do not crowd together in the lowest energy level, making atomic structure and chemistry possible. But since electrons follow every possible path in the universe, each one must be present in every other atom in some way. Therefore they claim that all electrons in the universe interact with each other, and must each have a slightly different energy level. This contradicts the fact that the energy levels are quantized, so they cannot be slightly different. I suspect the answer has to do with the superposition of states within an atom, and he has oversimplified the explanation.For some reason, the concept of entanglement is never mentioned, at least by name. Not only is this perhaps the most interesting implication of quantum mechanics, but entanglement and decoherence play an essential role in the so-called “measurement problem”. Instead we are told, “The approach to quantum mechanics that we have been discussing, which rejects the idea that Nature chooses a particular version of reality when someone (or something) ‘makes a measurement’, forms the basis of the Many Worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics. It is very appealing because it is the logical consequence of taking the laws that govern the behavior of elementary particles seriously enough to use them to describe all phenomena.” The subtitle of the book is that anything that can happen does happen. Does this mean particles appear to take every possible path in the universe, or that every possible history of a universe that can happen does happen in multiple universes? Somehow replacing a superposition of coherent states in an atom with a superposition of coherent universes is supposed to be an improvement. But then this controversial idea is not mentioned again, as “these musings are not of pressing importance when it comes to the serious business of computing the probability that something will happen when we do an experiment,” appearing to endorse the “shut up and calculate” school of physics.This book is really about the math, which a few philosophical insights (like those quoted above) sprinkled in. If you want philosophy, along with robust support for the multiverse, try The Beginning of Infinity: Explanations That Transform the World. For some basic insight into the mathematical basis of quantum mechanics, this book may be as good as it gets, but it is not a smooth ride."

Bearing all this in mind, you might well be expecting The Quantum Universe to be a bigger book. However, despite their brevity, Brain Cox and Jeff Forshaw do succeed admirably in their ambitious mission to show that everybody can understand the deepest questions of science.Over the course of eleven chapters [there’s also an epilogue concerning the death of stars] Cox and Forshaw use The Quantum Universe to provide readers with a fascinating, up-to-date picture of the subatomic world. Taking an historical approach to explaining quantum theory, Cox and Forshaw begin by investigating what exactly is contained within the discipline of quantum physics and how it helps to facilitate understanding of the universe. They consider the work of the great and the good [Newton, Bohr, Heisenberg, Einstein, etc] and how modern understanding of quantum theory has impacted on these ‘classic’ principles of physics. Once this background has been thoroughly established, Cox and Forshaw go on to explain the core of quantum theory itself, considering issues such as why particles can be in two places at once, why movement is an illusion, how empty space isn’t empty and why we don’t fall through the floor. It’s fascinating and occasionally spooky stuff.While The Quantum Universe might at first appear to be far less popularly accessible than the two astronomy books that Brain Cox has co-authored in the last year or so [those being the excellent Wonders of the Solar System and Wonders of the Universe], it is actually written in a very clear and straightforward, rather conversational in fact, style. There are certainly far less eye-catching pictures [although there are plenty of equations and charts] and The Quantum Universe is really a book that needs to be read from cover to cover in an orderly fashion rather than just dipped into, but it is still a book that engages the layman and explains complex scientific principles in appealingly simple terms. Petty as it may be, the most difficult to appreciate element of The Quantum Universe is the publisher’s choice of cover material.The Quantum Universe is a carefully thought out and well presented guide to a series of complex yet everyday issues. Brian Cox and Jeff Forshaw are clearly both very passionate about their scientific research and about sharing their knowledge with as wide an audience as possible. With this in mind, it is no surprise that they have succeeded brilliantly at providing a concise and straightforward [yet, importantly, never condescending] explanation of why “everything that can happen does happen.” This is not to say that it is always an easy book though. While no previous knowledge of complex mathematics or quantum theory is required in order to understand the explanations given by Cox and Forshaw, such knowledge would certainly be a boon and would aid an uninterrupted reading of the text.The Quantum Universe is a safe yet still exciting [detailed] introduction to quantum theory and its impact on our lives and universe. It is not always a ‘fun’ read but it is certainly a valuable one and is great for those seeking to understand the downright bizarre behaviour of atoms and energy [and the effects that these have on our equally bizarre human experience]."
26,1846144329,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5861984-judyta-szaci-o,5,"This is the most serious piece of literature on the subject that I have ever braved. I stopped pretending half-way through the book and skipped all the remaining descriptions of equasions (""chalk talk"", as it is called throughout the text), but I appreciate that they are by no means redundant, as the book aims to demonstrate the mathematical basis of quantum physics. There is plenty of commentary in between the equasions, and it does help to gain at least a vague idea of what they show.What they show is mind-blowing. I could not bring myself to trust all the pop-science I had read before. The implications I found there seemed wondrous, but also tremendously far-fetched. But I am a big fan of Brian Cox, and I trust the guy's not giving me any nonsense. Cox and Forshaw are cautious and meticulous in what they say, and yet I read:It really is conceivable that, at some time in our future, something can happen to us which requires that, in the past, we did two mutually opposite things.The approach to quantum mechanics that we have been discussing, which rejects the idea that Nature goes about choosing a particular version of reality every time someone (or something) ‘makes a measurement’, forms the basis of what is often referred to as the ‘many worlds’ interpretation. It is very appealing because it is the logical consequence of taking the laws that govern the behaviour of elementary particles seriously enough to use them to describe all phenomena. But the implications are striking, for we are to imagine that the Universe is really a coherent superposition of all of the possible things that can happen and the world as we perceive it (with its apparently concrete reality) arises only because we are fooled into thinking that coherence is lost every time we ‘measure’ something. I am lost in the sea of possibilities. How cool is that? :-)"

Unfortunately, I never could understand algebra and this is no average book explaining why things happen at all. Unlike other work of his I have read, which is written for the lay person, you need a degree in quantum mechanics to even begin to understand this one. I really tried but have to confess I didn't understand a word of it, despite Cox's best efforts at explaining things. There was even a TV show that aired the other evening 'A night with the stars' where Cox lectured to a group of celebs and covered some of the book. The material he covered I do understand but that is just the very basic concepts and the book tries to explain not what happens because it can, but rather why things happen - in mathematical terms that are beyond my comprehension. I already understood the second law of thermodynamics (law of entropy) well enough - but this is beyond me. No disrespect to Professor Cox. I am just not educated to that level regarding physics and unless you are, this is not for you."

I have a degree in mathematics, so I know imaginary numbers. But even with the knowledge that clocks in this book represent imaginary numbers some how, it was still hard to grasp. I can only imaging how confused readers who didn't know i must have been. Or maybe it was because I read this book with prior knowledge that I had such a hard time. In any case, it wasn't like the other book of Brian Cox I read this year, which was about relativity. I think I should stick to the academic books. They don't try to skip mathematics and if I spend a little more time familiarizing my self to the mathematics of the topic, I might develope a better understanding in the topic."

I can't say to have understood it in its entirety (to do so, would bear many re-readings, a renewal of calculus, some of Feynman's books, and a class), but Cox is able to explain many ideas about quantum theories that even I can comprehend, gave me a better understanding of transistors, and threw in a couple of historical oddities that had me giggling."

Yet, to the general public, much of it is either unknown by its applications, not understood by its significance, shrouded in false mysticism and pseudoscience by numerous frauds, and/or a subject of internet memes (Schrödinger’s cat is, and isn’t, for the rescue). The word “quantum” gets thrown around a lot by many people without fully understanding its meaning. This is where the particle physicists Brian Cox and Jeff Forshaw come in with their book “The Quantum Universe: Everything That Can Happen Does Happen”. Mainly, the book has three principal aim: A presentation of what quantum mechanics are and how they work, a demystification of quantum physics replying to all pseudoscience related to it, and providing examples and explanations on how quantum physics are part of our world.The authors did their best to try and show us the workings of quantum physics and especially highlighting that the universe is at no obligation to make sense to us. We can understand more and more how it functions, but that doesn’t have to be intuitive to our minds. They highlight as well how hugely titanic were/are the efforts in quantum physics to try and understand the inner and most delicate parts of the universe’s components. Nevertheless, I did find that this isn’t the most accessible of books regarding particle physics. A physics specialist would read it with ease, someone very much interested in physics, especially quantum physics, should be able to follow through, but it might not be the best option for someone who has never read anything on quantum physics before. This issue in my opinion is summarized by two points: The first is the reliance on mathematical equations several times during the book, and the second is the over reliance on a single analogy to represent quantum mechanics to the reader. This is why the book to me, which is a good book, is more of a demonstration of the workings of quantum mechanics (And see it’s natural to use math. This allows the authors to combat any pseudoscience.) rather than an imaginative explanation of quantum physics to the average reader. But I enjoyed reading it. It did teach me more stuff. It did help me understand more stuff. And I know I will be reading more and more on this fascinating field to understand better our cosmos."

I've been trying to get my head around the theory my entire adult life. I think I may now finally have a very basic grasp of the most significant elements of quantum theory and that, for me, is a cause for almost celebration. This is a book that respects its readers and expects some mental effort from them. There's some math you might want to work through and there's some modelling and visualizations to help you along. If you read these sections carefully, and do what they suggest, you're going to find yourself more embedded in the subject matter than some of the more armchair treatments of the subject matter.IMHO everyone needs to get their head around the basic tenets of the theory. There is a lot of nonsense out there that claims to rely on it to argue things like the mind having control over matter. Some of the implications of the theory are very hard to understand, they fly right in the face of observation and intuition, but that doesn't mean everything is possible. Far from it, the microworld has laws as well, but they operate on the basis of probability rather than deterministic predictions.Again, this is a superb book."

This, on the other hand, is a much much more difficult kettle of fish and suffers from the same shortcomings that A Brief History of Time does: it tries to avoid equations and explain complex mathematical concepts by using 'easy to understand' metaphors - in this case, clocks. This shorthand doesn't really work, and after much labouring, I soon wished Brian had taught me how to do the maths properly instead. Textually, this book is pretty impeccable.

Our minds have trouble conceiving of the vastness of the universe, on either scales of time and space, or their unified presentation as spacetime. And the moment we think we might possibly be able to get used to this idea, it becomes apparent that the very foundations of our universe are small. So small, so tiny, that the energy required to probe these depths is nearly as impressively vast as the scale of the universe they conspire to create. This is The Quantum Universe that Brian Cox and Jeff Forshaw want to explore with us.Quantum mechanics is notorious among physicists and laypeople alike for appearing to be nonsensical and unintuitive (or at least counter-intuitive). The chapter titles of this book illustrate this line of thought: “Being in Two Places at Once,” “Everything That Can Happen Does Happen,” “Movement as an Illusion,” etc. But such ideas are fundamentally biased by our perspective as macro-sized beings. If we experienced the world at the quantum level, then quantum mechanics would seem quite normal. Since our larger world is based on the confluence of so many quantum-level events, the picture this builds up is so far removed from those quantum effects that we get a false sense of reality.So Cox and Forshaw follow Heisenberg in establishing thatthe job of quantum theory should be to predict directly observable things…. It should not be expected to provide some kind of satisfying mental picture for the internal workings of the atom, because this is not necessary and it may not even be possible.This is really difficult to accept. I know because I read a lot about physics and science, and I still picture a really tiny, featureless sphere when I picture an electron. But, of course, the whole idea of “picturing” an electron is the part that doesn’t make sense. Particles are not solid lumps of matter that happen to be really small. Particles are waves and waves are particles because both are descriptions of specific phenomena, often at a particular space and time in the universe.Cox and Forshaw do a pretty good job, then, of deconstructing this false notion of particles. I also appreciate how they ground this deconstruction in the historical development of quantum mechanics. I knew the names, and had a vague idea of what the heavyweights behind quantum mechanics were known for—Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle, Rutherford and the structure of the atom, Dirac and antimatter, Schrödinger and the wave equation, etc. But Cox and Forshaw provide a more detailed context and chronology. They would describe, for instance, how Rutherford quickly realized the solar system model of the atom was wrong, or how Born or Dirac or Feynman would feed off each other’s discoveries very quickly. The 1920s was a really interesting time in the rapid development of quantum theory!Starting around chapter 3, the book tries to explain these basic ideas in quantum theory to a reader who is assumed to have little scientific or mathematical background. Cox and Forshaw try to be reassuring, claiming that if someone is intimidated by the math, they can safely skip it. To their credit, although they refer to calculus and other higher math, the actual math they show is comprehensible to someone who took high school physics. Nevertheless, if you do skip the math … well, you’ll end up reading very little of what’s already a short book.I fear The Quantum Universe suffers from trying to have its cake and eat it as well. Cox and Forshaw are so invested in not having to explain complex-based trigonometry to a lay audience that they manage to invent an analogy even more complicated than this math! I pulled down my copy of 
The Illustrated A Brief History of Time and The Universe in a Nutshell
, really the best, to see how Stephen Hawking deals with this. He dodges it by just not discussing the math behind it (famously, of course, declaiming in his original introduction that each equation would apparently halve book sales). Yet somehow he manages to discuss the double-slit experiment, quantized electron orbits, and sum-over-histories just fine.Buried deep in later chapters, Cox and Forshaw explain the difference between the Copenhagen and many-worlds interpretations (though they don’t identify the former as such). And then they take a half-hearted stab and describing the Standard Model but acknowledge it’s going beyond the remit of the book. (
Knocking on Heaven’s Door
, although laden with a lot of other information and tangents, provides one of the most cogent explanations of the Standard Model I’ve read.)It’s a shame, because in between the confusing analogies and inexorable unravelling, The Quantum Universe treats the subject of quantum mechanics with wit and a graceful touch. Cox and Forshaw write well together. There is a sense of humour to the descriptions, particularly when they take a stab at the intelligence of drum players (since Cox used to be in a rock band). Despite making assurances about being able to skip the math, they never patronize the reader. This could have been a brilliant introduction to quantum mechanics for the layperson. As it is, while it’s not a total trainwreck, I wouldn’t recommend starting here either.

As other reviewers have stated, the clock analogy is developed as a system to enable people to understand the concepts in quantum physics, but instead ends up being more complicated than the subject itself. Probably the worst use of analogy I've ever read. Everytime a new chapter starts its not long before clocks are brought up again, and I found myself skimming through until there were no clock references. An analogy too far! "
48,1846144329,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13257565-damian-pearce,4,"Great book worth taking your time with. There's no mathematics in it so you don't need a background in that to understand what the co-authors are describing to you. There is a chapter at the end - an epilogue - that does contain some mathematics, quite a bit and it describes why White Dwarfs exist. This chapter is optional to read but I read it anyway.I think the job of a science book for the public is to enhance or change the understanding of the reader of the subject and I think this book certainly did that. A little easier going than Brian Greene's Elegant Universe... but just as informative. Good stuff!"
49,1846144329,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48678927-bor-zupan,4,"It was on my reading list for quite a while. It took me far too much time, which was mostly spent on rereading past paragraphs. I would recommend a piece of paper and a pen to make some notes as you read through it.Somewhere in the middle I found it extraordinary that a book can explain the principle quantum laws and ideas with virtually no math involved. But in the end it would be a lot simpler to just educate the average reader with the complex numbers and wave mechanics, because the analogy with clocks starts to make less and less sense and in the end the writer himself realizes that he cant really explain QF without equations :) Still. I think it deserves 4/5"
50,1846144329,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61205946-sam-close,3,"A good introduction to some quantum phenomena for a beginner, but becomes very quickly complex and hard to grasp even for someone with a more mathematical background. This can be seen with the explanation of the phase of a wave using a clock; referring to moving forwards in time confuses the notion of winding back the clocks. I reckon 5-10 pages maximum of explaining what the clocks actually were, it would've been a lot more coherent throughout. Otherwise an enjoyable read with some eureka moments throughout."
51,1846144329,http://goodreads.com/user/show/196037-jrobertus,3,"Watching a Great Courses series stimulated me to refresh my long gone studies in quantum mechanics. This book is quite good for lay readers. It adopts the Feynman method of analysis which I had at UCSD and which is a good one. In order to avoid too much math the authors adopt some rather strained clock metaphors which I found more confusing than the actual math. However, I have used complex numbers for wave analysis as part of my work for 50 years so that helps. Anyway, if you are a nerd and want to understand some of the basics of quantum weirdness, this is a good place to go."
52,1846144329,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65498977-samarjeet-das-ray,3,"The authors made the book unnecessarily complicated at places especially at the end. I couldn’t understand the reason to explain the calculation of Chandrasekhar limit. Also, tribute should have been paid to Indian scientist SN Bose as he and Einstein discovered the statistical rules for particles which do not follow Pauli’s Exclusion principle leading to Dirac naming a set of particles as Boson. After all, Higgs particles are a type of Boson. "
53,1846144329,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62747656-shreyansh-jain,4,"Certainly an entertaining read.Brain Cox has a way of showing how to eat the elephant to his readers and this book didnt disappoint either. It was perhaps a little too dumbed down but halfway into it rapidly picks up speed. He should have exposed more of behind the scene equations since converting them all to ""English"" makes this a somewhat laborious read. After all, most readers of this book would have some aptitude for actual math anyway (or an interest to learn). A good intro overall. "
54,1846144329,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76263262-tim,2,"I am not sure what I expect out of these books trying to describe quantum theory but I'm generally disappointed in them. This one does present explanations/interpretations for Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle (and some other effects that I knew about) in ways I had not seen before and presented an explanation that I could nearly grasp as to why every particle knows about every other particle in the universe. About half way through, though, the narrative became not much use or interest to me."
55,1846144329,http://goodreads.com/user/show/107537185-callum-hair,3,"The authors faced a monumental task in this book: making quantum mechanics accessible to the general public. They fall short in a few ways, with a few too many analogies about clocks and other less than accessible passages. I feel that wavelength diagrams may have been simpler to get some of the science across. Having said that, there was a lot to gain from this book about the history of quantum mechanics, and how it has exponentially improved our lives."
56,1846144329,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38766886-adam-wigington,2,"I thought the clock analogy for particle waves confounding perhaps because I have a better mathematics understanding than the target reader.

There were plenty of good explanations and interesting quantum physics explained."
57,1846144329,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12969777-dan-cooley,3,Interesting but I found the way it was explained a but convoluted. The use of clocks as a way to explain what happens is kind of more confusing than what is actually going on. I think maybe I need to read this again or maybe read another book on the subject. It hasn't dampened my curiosity though even though some of it was hard to fathom.

70,1846144329,http://goodreads.com/user/show/96942433-basel,3,"Niels Bohr famously said “Anyone who is not shocked by quantum theory has not understood it.” The field of quantum mechanics in physics is one of the most revolutionary leaps achieved by humanity in understanding the universe, and in improving our lives. Yet, to the general public, much of it is either unknown by its applications, not understood by its significance, shrouded in false mysticism and pseudoscience by numerous frauds, and/or a subject of internet memes (Schrödinger’s cat is, and isn’t, for the rescue). The word “quantum” gets thrown around a lot by many people without fully understanding its meaning. This is where the particle physicists Brian Cox and Jeff Forshaw come in with their book “The Quantum Universe: Everything That Can Happen Does Happen”. Mainly, the book has three principal aim: A presentation of what quantum mechanics are and how they work, a demystification of quantum physics replying to all pseudoscience related to it, and providing examples and explanations on how quantum physics are part of our world.The authors did their best to try and show us the workings of quantum physics and especially highlighting that the universe is at no obligation to make sense to us. We can understand more and more how it functions, but that doesn’t have to be intuitive to our minds. They highlight as well how hugely titanic were/are the efforts in quantum physics to try and understand the inner and most delicate parts of the universe’s components. Nevertheless, I did find that this isn’t the most accessible of books regarding particle physics. A physics specialist would read it with ease, someone very much interested in physics, especially quantum physics, should be able to follow through, but it might not be the best option for someone who has never read anything on quantum physics before. This issue in my opinion is summarized by two points: The first is the reliance on mathematical equations several times during the book, and the second is the over reliance on a single analogy to represent quantum mechanics to the reader. This is why the book to me, which is a good book, is more of a demonstration of the workings of quantum mechanics (And see it’s natural to use math. This allows the authors to combat any pseudoscience.) rather than an imaginative explanation of quantum physics to the average reader. But I enjoyed reading it. It did teach me more stuff. It did help me understand more stuff. And I know I will be reading more and more on this fascinating field to understand better our cosmos."
71,1846144329,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12173625-peter-crofts,5,"Superb. Absolutely superb. The authors don't treat you like a dunce, nor as a particle physicist. It really hit the sweet spot for me. I've read a lot of texts aimed at the layman and this is the one where things started to, for once, really kick in. I've been trying to get my head around the theory my entire adult life. I think I may now finally have a very basic grasp of the most significant elements of quantum theory and that, for me, is a cause for almost celebration. This is a book that respects its readers and expects some mental effort from them. There's some math you might want to work through and there's some modelling and visualizations to help you along. If you read these sections carefully, and do what they suggest, you're going to find yourself more embedded in the subject matter than some of the more armchair treatments of the subject matter.IMHO everyone needs to get their head around the basic tenets of the theory. There is a lot of nonsense out there that claims to rely on it to argue things like the mind having control over matter. Some of the implications of the theory are very hard to understand, they fly right in the face of observation and intuition, but that doesn't mean everything is possible. Far from it, the microworld has laws as well, but they operate on the basis of probability rather than deterministic predictions.Again, this is a superb book."

This, on the other hand, is a much much more difficult kettle of fish and suffers from the same shortcomings that A Brief History of Time does: it tries to avoid equations and explain complex mathematical concepts by using 'easy to understand' metaphors - in this case, clocks. This shorthand doesn't really work, and after much labouring, I soon wished Brian had taught me how to do the maths properly instead. Textually, this book is pretty impeccable. It's written in a moderately colloquial, but still highbrow, style and immaculately proofread.

100,1846144329,http://goodreads.com/user/show/96942433-basel,3,"Niels Bohr famously said “Anyone who is not shocked by quantum theory has not understood it.” The field of quantum mechanics in physics is one of the most revolutionary leaps achieved by humanity in understanding the universe, and in improving our lives. Yet, to the general public, much of it is either unknown by its applications, not understood by its significance, shrouded in false mysticism and pseudoscience by numerous frauds, and/or a subject of internet memes (Schrödinger’s cat is, and isn’t, for the rescue). The word “quantum” gets thrown around a lot by many people without fully understanding its meaning. This is where the particle physicists Brian Cox and Jeff Forshaw come in with their book “The Quantum Universe: Everything That Can Happen Does Happen”. Mainly, the book has three principal aim: A presentation of what quantum mechanics are and how they work, a demystification of quantum physics replying to all pseudoscience related to it, and providing examples and explanations on how quantum physics are part of our world.The authors did their best to try and show us the workings of quantum physics and especially highlighting that the universe is at no obligation to make sense to us. We can understand more and more how it functions, but that doesn’t have to be intuitive to our minds. They highlight as well how hugely titanic were/are the efforts in quantum physics to try and understand the inner and most delicate parts of the universe’s components. Nevertheless, I did find that this isn’t the most accessible of books regarding particle physics. A physics specialist would read it with ease, someone very much interested in physics, especially quantum physics, should be able to follow through, but it might not be the best option for someone who has never read anything on quantum physics before. This issue in my opinion is summarized by two points: The first is the reliance on mathematical equations several times during the book, and the second is the over reliance on a single analogy to represent quantum mechanics to the reader. This is why the book to me, which is a good book, is more of a demonstration of the workings of quantum mechanics (And see it’s natural to use math. This allows the authors to combat any pseudoscience.) rather than an imaginative explanation of quantum physics to the average reader. But I enjoyed reading it. It did teach me more stuff. It did help me understand more stuff. And I know I will be reading more and more on this fascinating field to understand better our cosmos."
101,1846144329,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12173625-peter-crofts,5,"Superb. Absolutely superb. The authors don't treat you like a dunce, nor as a particle physicist. It really hit the sweet spot for me. I've read a lot of texts aimed at the layman and this is the one where things started to, for once, really kick in. I've been trying to get my head around the theory my entire adult life. I think I may now finally have a very basic grasp of the most significant elements of quantum theory and that, for me, is a cause for almost celebration. This is a book that respects its readers and expects some mental effort from them. There's some math you might want to work through and there's some modelling and visualizations to help you along. If you read these sections carefully, and do what they suggest, you're going to find yourself more embedded in the subject matter than some of the more armchair treatments of the subject matter.IMHO everyone needs to get their head around the basic tenets of the theory. There is a lot of nonsense out there that claims to rely on it to argue things like the mind having control over matter. Some of the implications of the theory are very hard to understand, they fly right in the face of observation and intuition, but that doesn't mean everything is possible. Far from it, the microworld has laws as well, but they operate on the basis of probability rather than deterministic predictions.Again, this is a superb book."
102,1846144329,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5949552-andrew-ives,4,"Brian Cox's many TV series, and his really enjoyable Human Universe book, are all quite accessible to most people. This, on the other hand, is a much much more difficult kettle of fish and suffers from the same shortcomings that A Brief History of Time does: it tries to avoid equations and explain complex mathematical concepts by using 'easy to understand' metaphors - in this case, clocks. This shorthand doesn't really work, and after much labouring, I soon wished Brian had taught me how to do the maths properly instead. Textually, this book is pretty impeccable. It's written in a moderately colloquial, but still highbrow, style and immaculately proofread. Around the 150-200 page area, I became quite lost, slightly disbelieving of the theories, consequently slipping in and out of comprehension no matter how many times I reread certain paragraphs. The epilogue chapter about calculating the Chandrasekhar limit is quite mindboggling. I think I managed to catch about 60% of it if I really concentrated hard, but he does qualify that by saying it's one of the pinnacles of human mental achievement. I can well believe it! 4.25/5"
103,1846144329,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75039510-toby-bond,3,"Some of this book is mind bending, especially when they talk about the double slit experiment and go into heisenberg. Some of the book you have to re-read several times to make sure you kind of understand what is going on, the clocks and wave interference were fine, its when they start extrapolating their ideas that it gets tricky. Usually i snatch reading time when i can, therefore stopping and starting the book frequently meant going back a few pages to re-acquaint yourself with what the hell is going on. The book is written in a folksy style, as if quantum physics is the stuff of daily conversation, peppered with unfunny jokes and a moderate amount of smugness. I like science orientated books and have read a fair amount of Brian Cox's work, this isn't his best. I would prefer to read Galfard's 'The universe in your hand', it doesnt go into as much detail, but it is better written, more engaging and accessible."

I believe it's my problem, i don't have a good basic about particle physics, nor mathematics. This book is rather difficult for to hit the point. The first half seems still ok, but second half i am totally lost.

105,1846144329,http://goodreads.com/user/show/78342970-nina,3,"This book. What a frustrating experience. Because some of the material in this was familiar from other places, like the BBC2 lecture thing Cox presented some weeks back, I could understand some of what was in this book, but unfortunately, it was just enough to be able to grasp that I was missing a lot! Ideas formed in my head, but very often they never quite came to fruition. The book became an increasingly difficult read as it went on, but I enjoyed it enough to glean what I could. And I enjoyed it enough to feel a terrible regret about my ability to understand not quite stretching as far as I wanted it to. I'm not entirely sure if this is written for the science-literate or the layperson, all I know is it left me behind at some point, as well as leaving me feeling a little thick. So, three stars of limited understanding for a probable five star read."
106,1846144329,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1188122-kara-babcock,2,"The universe is big. Mindbogglingly big. Our minds have trouble conceiving of the vastness of the universe, on either scales of time and space, or their unified presentation as spacetime. And the moment we think we might possibly be able to get used to this idea, it becomes apparent that the very foundations of our universe are small. So small, so tiny, that the energy required to probe these depths is nearly as impressively vast as the scale of the universe they conspire to create. This is The Quantum Universe that Brian Cox and Jeff Forshaw want to explore with us.Quantum mechanics is notorious among physicists and laypeople alike for appearing to be nonsensical and unintuitive (or at least counter-intuitive). The chapter titles of this book illustrate this line of thought: “Being in Two Places at Once,” “Everything That Can Happen Does Happen,” “Movement as an Illusion,” etc. But such ideas are fundamentally biased by our perspective as macro-sized beings. If we experienced the world at the quantum level, then quantum mechanics would seem quite normal. Since our larger world is based on the confluence of so many quantum-level events, the picture this builds up is so far removed from those quantum effects that we get a false sense of reality.So Cox and Forshaw follow Heisenberg in establishing thatthe job of quantum theory should be to predict directly observable things…. It should not be expected to provide some kind of satisfying mental picture for the internal workings of the atom, because this is not necessary and it may not even be possible.This is really difficult to accept. I know because I read a lot about physics and science, and I still picture a really tiny, featureless sphere when I picture an electron. But, of course, the whole idea of “picturing” an electron is the part that doesn’t make sense. Particles are not solid lumps of matter that happen to be really small. Particles are waves and waves are particles because both are descriptions of specific phenomena, often at a particular space and time in the universe.Cox and Forshaw do a pretty good job, then, of deconstructing this false notion of particles. I also appreciate how they ground this deconstruction in the historical development of quantum mechanics. I knew the names, and had a vague idea of what the heavyweights behind quantum mechanics were known for—Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle, Rutherford and the structure of the atom, Dirac and antimatter, Schrödinger and the wave equation, etc. But Cox and Forshaw provide a more detailed context and chronology. They would describe, for instance, how Rutherford quickly realized the solar system model of the atom was wrong, or how Born or Dirac or Feynman would feed off each other’s discoveries very quickly. The 1920s was a really interesting time in the rapid development of quantum theory!Starting around chapter 3, the book tries to explain these basic ideas in quantum theory to a reader who is assumed to have little scientific or mathematical background. Cox and Forshaw try to be reassuring, claiming that if someone is intimidated by the math, they can safely skip it. To their credit, although they refer to calculus and other higher math, the actual math they show is comprehensible to someone who took high school physics. Nevertheless, if you do skip the math … well, you’ll end up reading very little of what’s already a short book.I fear The Quantum Universe suffers from trying to have its cake and eat it as well. Cox and Forshaw are so invested in not having to explain complex-based trigonometry to a lay audience that they manage to invent an analogy even more complicated than this math! I pulled down my copy of 
The Illustrated A Brief History of Time and The Universe in a Nutshell
, really the best, to see how Stephen Hawking deals with this. He dodges it by just not discussing the math behind it (famously, of course, declaiming in his original introduction that each equation would apparently halve book sales). Yet somehow he manages to discuss the double-slit experiment, quantized electron orbits, and sum-over-histories just fine.Buried deep in later chapters, Cox and Forshaw explain the difference between the Copenhagen and many-worlds interpretations (though they don’t identify the former as such). And then they take a half-hearted stab and describing the Standard Model but acknowledge it’s going beyond the remit of the book. (
Knocking on Heaven’s Door
, although laden with a lot of other information and tangents, provides one of the most cogent explanations of the Standard Model I’ve read.)It’s a shame, because in between the confusing analogies and inexorable unravelling, The Quantum Universe treats the subject of quantum mechanics with wit and a graceful touch. Cox and Forshaw write well together. There is a sense of humour to the descriptions, particularly when they take a stab at the intelligence of drum players (since Cox used to be in a rock band). Despite making assurances about being able to skip the math, they never patronize the reader. This could have been a brilliant introduction to quantum mechanics for the layperson. As it is, while it’s not a total trainwreck, I wouldn’t recommend starting here either.

Some of the book you have to re-read several times to make sure you kind of understand what is going on, the clocks and wave interference were fine, its when they start extrapolating their ideas that it gets tricky. Usually i snatch reading time when i can, therefore stopping and starting the book frequently meant going back a few pages to re-acquaint yourself with what the hell is going on. The book is written in a folksy style, as if quantum physics is the stuff of daily conversation, peppered with unfunny jokes and a moderate amount of smugness.

Ideas formed in my head, but very often they never quite came to fruition. The book became an increasingly difficult read as it went on, but I enjoyed it enough to glean what I could. And I enjoyed it enough to feel a terrible regret about my ability to understand not quite stretching as far as I wanted it to.

136,1846144329,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1188122-kara-babcock,2,"The universe is big. Mindbogglingly big. Our minds have trouble conceiving of the vastness of the universe, on either scales of time and space, or their unified presentation as spacetime. And the moment we think we might possibly be able to get used to this idea, it becomes apparent that the very foundations of our universe are small. So small, so tiny, that the energy required to probe these depths is nearly as impressively vast as the scale of the universe they conspire to create. This is The Quantum Universe that Brian Cox and Jeff Forshaw want to explore with us.Quantum mechanics is notorious among physicists and laypeople alike for appearing to be nonsensical and unintuitive (or at least counter-intuitive). The chapter titles of this book illustrate this line of thought: “Being in Two Places at Once,” “Everything That Can Happen Does Happen,” “Movement as an Illusion,” etc. But such ideas are fundamentally biased by our perspective as macro-sized beings. If we experienced the world at the quantum level, then quantum mechanics would seem quite normal. Since our larger world is based on the confluence of so many quantum-level events, the picture this builds up is so far removed from those quantum effects that we get a false sense of reality.So Cox and Forshaw follow Heisenberg in establishing thatthe job of quantum theory should be to predict directly observable things…. It should not be expected to provide some kind of satisfying mental picture for the internal workings of the atom, because this is not necessary and it may not even be possible.This is really difficult to accept. I know because I read a lot about physics and science, and I still picture a really tiny, featureless sphere when I picture an electron. But, of course, the whole idea of “picturing” an electron is the part that doesn’t make sense. Particles are not solid lumps of matter that happen to be really small. Particles are waves and waves are particles because both are descriptions of specific phenomena, often at a particular space and time in the universe.Cox and Forshaw do a pretty good job, then, of deconstructing this false notion of particles. I also appreciate how they ground this deconstruction in the historical development of quantum mechanics. I knew the names, and had a vague idea of what the heavyweights behind quantum mechanics were known for—Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle, Rutherford and the structure of the atom, Dirac and antimatter, Schrödinger and the wave equation, etc. But Cox and Forshaw provide a more detailed context and chronology. They would describe, for instance, how Rutherford quickly realized the solar system model of the atom was wrong, or how Born or Dirac or Feynman would feed off each other’s discoveries very quickly. The 1920s was a really interesting time in the rapid development of quantum theory!Starting around chapter 3, the book tries to explain these basic ideas in quantum theory to a reader who is assumed to have little scientific or mathematical background. Cox and Forshaw try to be reassuring, claiming that if someone is intimidated by the math, they can safely skip it. To their credit, although they refer to calculus and other higher math, the actual math they show is comprehensible to someone who took high school physics. Nevertheless, if you do skip the math … well, you’ll end up reading very little of what’s already a short book.I fear The Quantum Universe suffers from trying to have its cake and eat it as well. Cox and Forshaw are so invested in not having to explain complex-based trigonometry to a lay audience that they manage to invent an analogy even more complicated than this math! I pulled down my copy of 
The Illustrated A Brief History of Time and The Universe in a Nutshell
, really the best, to see how Stephen Hawking deals with this. He dodges it by just not discussing the math behind it (famously, of course, declaiming in his original introduction that each equation would apparently halve book sales). Yet somehow he manages to discuss the double-slit experiment, quantized electron orbits, and sum-over-histories just fine.Buried deep in later chapters, Cox and Forshaw explain the difference between the Copenhagen and many-worlds interpretations (though they don’t identify the former as such). And then they take a half-hearted stab and describing the Standard Model but acknowledge it’s going beyond the remit of the book. (
Knocking on Heaven’s Door
, although laden with a lot of other information and tangents, provides one of the most cogent explanations of the Standard Model I’ve read.)It’s a shame, because in between the confusing analogies and inexorable unravelling, The Quantum Universe treats the subject of quantum mechanics with wit and a graceful touch. Cox and Forshaw write well together. There is a sense of humour to the descriptions, particularly when they take a stab at the intelligence of drum players (since Cox used to be in a rock band). Despite making assurances about being able to skip the math, they never patronize the reader. This could have been a brilliant introduction to quantum mechanics for the layperson. As it is, while it’s not a total trainwreck, I wouldn’t recommend starting here either.

137,1846144329,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75505674-victor-kurzweil,1,"What started as an exciting explanation of quantum mechanics very quickly became a total failure as the authors brought it an analogy of clocks to explain quantum fields and probabilities. As other reviewers have stated, the clock analogy is developed as a system to enable people to understand the concepts in quantum physics, but instead ends up being more complicated than the subject itself. Probably the worst use of analogy I've ever read. Everytime a new chapter starts its not long before clocks are brought up again, and I found myself skimming through until there were no clock references. An analogy too far! "
138,1846144329,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13257565-damian-pearce,4,"Great book worth taking your time with. There's no mathematics in it so you don't need a background in that to understand what the co-authors are describing to you. There is a chapter at the end - an epilogue - that does contain some mathematics, quite a bit and it describes why White Dwarfs exist. This chapter is optional to read but I read it anyway.I think the job of a science book for the public is to enhance or change the understanding of the reader of the subject and I think this book certainly did that. A little easier going than Brian Greene's Elegant Universe... but just as informative. Good stuff!"

I would recommend a piece of paper and a pen to make some notes as you read through it.Somewhere in the middle I found it extraordinary that a book can explain the principle quantum laws and ideas with virtually no math involved. But in the end it would be a lot simpler to just educate the average reader with the complex numbers and wave mechanics, because the analogy with clocks starts to make less and less sense and in the end the writer himself realizes that he cant really explain QF without equations :) Still. I think it deserves 4/5"
140,1846144329,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61205946-sam-close,3,"A good introduction to some quantum phenomena for a beginner, but becomes very quickly complex and hard to grasp even for someone with a more mathematical background. This can be seen with the explanation of the phase of a wave using a clock; referring to moving forwards in time confuses the notion of winding back the clocks. I reckon 5-10 pages maximum of explaining what the clocks actually were, it would've been a lot more coherent throughout. Otherwise an enjoyable read with some eureka moments throughout."
141,1846144329,http://goodreads.com/user/show/196037-jrobertus,3,"Watching a Great Courses series stimulated me to refresh my long gone studies in quantum mechanics. This book is quite good for lay readers. It adopts the Feynman method of analysis which I had at UCSD and which is a good one. In order to avoid too much math the authors adopt some rather strained clock metaphors which I found more confusing than the actual math. However, I have used complex numbers for wave analysis as part of my work for 50 years so that helps. Anyway, if you are a nerd and want to understand some of the basics of quantum weirdness, this is a good place to go."

This one does present explanations/interpretations for Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle (and some other effects that I knew about) in ways I had not seen before and presented an explanation that I could nearly grasp as to why every particle knows about every other particle in the universe.

Our minds have trouble conceiving of the vastness of the universe, on either scales of time and space, or their unified presentation as spacetime. And the moment we think we might possibly be able to get used to this idea, it becomes apparent that the very foundations of our universe are small. So small, so tiny, that the energy required to probe these depths is nearly as impressively vast as the scale of the universe they conspire to create. This is The Quantum Universe that Brian Cox and Jeff Forshaw want to explore with us.Quantum mechanics is notorious among physicists and laypeople alike for appearing to be nonsensical and unintuitive (or at least counter-intuitive). The chapter titles of this book illustrate this line of thought: “Being in Two Places at Once,” “Everything That Can Happen Does Happen,” “Movement as an Illusion,” etc. But such ideas are fundamentally biased by our perspective as macro-sized beings. If we experienced the world at the quantum level, then quantum mechanics would seem quite normal. Since our larger world is based on the confluence of so many quantum-level events, the picture this builds up is so far removed from those quantum effects that we get a false sense of reality.So Cox and Forshaw follow Heisenberg in establishing thatthe job of quantum theory should be to predict directly observable things…. It should not be expected to provide some kind of satisfying mental picture for the internal workings of the atom, because this is not necessary and it may not even be possible.This is really difficult to accept. I know because I read a lot about physics and science, and I still picture a really tiny, featureless sphere when I picture an electron. But, of course, the whole idea of “picturing” an electron is the part that doesn’t make sense. Particles are not solid lumps of matter that happen to be really small. Particles are waves and waves are particles because both are descriptions of specific phenomena, often at a particular space and time in the universe.Cox and Forshaw do a pretty good job, then, of deconstructing this false notion of particles. I also appreciate how they ground this deconstruction in the historical development of quantum mechanics. I knew the names, and had a vague idea of what the heavyweights behind quantum mechanics were known for—Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle, Rutherford and the structure of the atom, Dirac and antimatter, Schrödinger and the wave equation, etc. But Cox and Forshaw provide a more detailed context and chronology. They would describe, for instance, how Rutherford quickly realized the solar system model of the atom was wrong, or how Born or Dirac or Feynman would feed off each other’s discoveries very quickly. The 1920s was a really interesting time in the rapid development of quantum theory!Starting around chapter 3, the book tries to explain these basic ideas in quantum theory to a reader who is assumed to have little scientific or mathematical background. Cox and Forshaw try to be reassuring, claiming that if someone is intimidated by the math, they can safely skip it. To their credit, although they refer to calculus and other higher math, the actual math they show is comprehensible to someone who took high school physics.

Cox and Forshaw write well together. There is a sense of humour to the descriptions, particularly when they take a stab at the intelligence of drum players (since Cox used to be in a rock band). Despite making assurances about being able to skip the math, they never patronize the reader. This could have been a brilliant introduction to quantum mechanics for the layperson.

As other reviewers have stated, the clock analogy is developed as a system to enable people to understand the concepts in quantum physics, but instead ends up being more complicated than the subject itself. Probably the worst use of analogy I've ever read. Everytime a new chapter starts its not long before clocks are brought up again, and I found myself skimming through until there were no clock references. An analogy too far! "
168,1846144329,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13257565-damian-pearce,4,"Great book worth taking your time with. There's no mathematics in it so you don't need a background in that to understand what the co-authors are describing to you. There is a chapter at the end - an epilogue - that does contain some mathematics, quite a bit and it describes why White Dwarfs exist. This chapter is optional to read but I read it anyway.I think the job of a science book for the public is to enhance or change the understanding of the reader of the subject and I think this book certainly did that. A little easier going than Brian Greene's Elegant Universe... but just as informative. Good stuff!"
169,1846144329,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48678927-bor-zupan,4,"It was on my reading list for quite a while. It took me far too much time, which was mostly spent on rereading past paragraphs. I would recommend a piece of paper and a pen to make some notes as you read through it.Somewhere in the middle I found it extraordinary that a book can explain the principle quantum laws and ideas with virtually no math involved. But in the end it would be a lot simpler to just educate the average reader with the complex numbers and wave mechanics, because the analogy with clocks starts to make less and less sense and in the end the writer himself realizes that he cant really explain QF without equations :) Still. I think it deserves 4/5"
170,1846144329,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61205946-sam-close,3,"A good introduction to some quantum phenomena for a beginner, but becomes very quickly complex and hard to grasp even for someone with a more mathematical background. This can be seen with the explanation of the phase of a wave using a clock; referring to moving forwards in time confuses the notion of winding back the clocks. I reckon 5-10 pages maximum of explaining what the clocks actually were, it would've been a lot more coherent throughout. Otherwise an enjoyable read with some eureka moments throughout."
171,1846144329,http://goodreads.com/user/show/196037-jrobertus,3,"Watching a Great Courses series stimulated me to refresh my long gone studies in quantum mechanics. This book is quite good for lay readers. It adopts the Feynman method of analysis which I had at UCSD and which is a good one. In order to avoid too much math the authors adopt some rather strained clock metaphors which I found more confusing than the actual math. However, I have used complex numbers for wave analysis as part of my work for 50 years so that helps. Anyway, if you are a nerd and want to understand some of the basics of quantum weirdness, this is a good place to go."

I couldn’t understand the reason to explain the calculation of Chandrasekhar limit. Also, tribute should have been paid to Indian scientist SN Bose as he and Einstein discovered the statistical rules for particles which do not follow Pauli’s Exclusion principle leading to Dirac naming a set of particles as Boson. After all, Higgs particles are a type of Boson. "

It was perhaps a little too dumbed down but halfway into it rapidly picks up speed. He should have exposed more of behind the scene equations since converting them all to ""English"" makes this a somewhat laborious read. After all, most readers of this book would have some aptitude for actual math anyway (or an interest to learn). A good intro overall. "

This one does present explanations/interpretations for Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle (and some other effects that I knew about) in ways I had not seen before and presented an explanation that I could nearly grasp as to why every particle knows about every other particle in the universe. About half way through, though, the narrative became not much use or interest to me."

They fall short in a few ways, with a few too many analogies about clocks and other less than accessible passages. I feel that wavelength diagrams may have been simpler to get some of the science across. Having said that, there was a lot to gain from this book about the history of quantum mechanics, and how it has exponentially improved our lives."

190,1846144329,http://goodreads.com/user/show/96942433-basel,3,"Niels Bohr famously said “Anyone who is not shocked by quantum theory has not understood it.” The field of quantum mechanics in physics is one of the most revolutionary leaps achieved by humanity in understanding the universe, and in improving our lives. Yet, to the general public, much of it is either unknown by its applications, not understood by its significance, shrouded in false mysticism and pseudoscience by numerous frauds, and/or a subject of internet memes (Schrödinger’s cat is, and isn’t, for the rescue). The word “quantum” gets thrown around a lot by many people without fully understanding its meaning. This is where the particle physicists Brian Cox and Jeff Forshaw come in with their book “The Quantum Universe: Everything That Can Happen Does Happen”. Mainly, the book has three principal aim: A presentation of what quantum mechanics are and how they work, a demystification of quantum physics replying to all pseudoscience related to it, and providing examples and explanations on how quantum physics are part of our world.The authors did their best to try and show us the workings of quantum physics and especially highlighting that the universe is at no obligation to make sense to us. We can understand more and more how it functions, but that doesn’t have to be intuitive to our minds. They highlight as well how hugely titanic were/are the efforts in quantum physics to try and understand the inner and most delicate parts of the universe’s components. Nevertheless, I did find that this isn’t the most accessible of books regarding particle physics. A physics specialist would read it with ease, someone very much interested in physics, especially quantum physics, should be able to follow through, but it might not be the best option for someone who has never read anything on quantum physics before. This issue in my opinion is summarized by two points: The first is the reliance on mathematical equations several times during the book, and the second is the over reliance on a single analogy to represent quantum mechanics to the reader. This is why the book to me, which is a good book, is more of a demonstration of the workings of quantum mechanics (And see it’s natural to use math. This allows the authors to combat any pseudoscience.) rather than an imaginative explanation of quantum physics to the average reader. But I enjoyed reading it. It did teach me more stuff. It did help me understand more stuff. And I know I will be reading more and more on this fascinating field to understand better our cosmos."
191,1846144329,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12173625-peter-crofts,5,"Superb. Absolutely superb. The authors don't treat you like a dunce, nor as a particle physicist. It really hit the sweet spot for me. I've read a lot of texts aimed at the layman and this is the one where things started to, for once, really kick in. I've been trying to get my head around the theory my entire adult life. I think I may now finally have a very basic grasp of the most significant elements of quantum theory and that, for me, is a cause for almost celebration. This is a book that respects its readers and expects some mental effort from them. There's some math you might want to work through and there's some modelling and visualizations to help you along. If you read these sections carefully, and do what they suggest, you're going to find yourself more embedded in the subject matter than some of the more armchair treatments of the subject matter.IMHO everyone needs to get their head around the basic tenets of the theory. There is a lot of nonsense out there that claims to rely on it to argue things like the mind having control over matter. Some of the implications of the theory are very hard to understand, they fly right in the face of observation and intuition, but that doesn't mean everything is possible. Far from it, the microworld has laws as well, but they operate on the basis of probability rather than deterministic predictions.Again, this is a superb book."

This, on the other hand, is a much much more difficult kettle of fish and suffers from the same shortcomings that A Brief History of Time does: it tries to avoid equations and explain complex mathematical concepts by using 'easy to understand' metaphors - in this case, clocks. This shorthand doesn't really work, and after much labouring, I soon wished Brian had taught me how to do the maths properly instead. Textually, this book is pretty impeccable. It's written in a moderately colloquial, but still highbrow, style and immaculately proofread. Around the 150-200 page area, I became quite lost, slightly disbelieving of the theories, consequently slipping in and out of comprehension no matter how many times I reread certain paragraphs. The epilogue chapter about calculating the Chandrasekhar limit is quite mindboggling.

220,1846144329,http://goodreads.com/user/show/96942433-basel,3,"Niels Bohr famously said “Anyone who is not shocked by quantum theory has not understood it.” The field of quantum mechanics in physics is one of the most revolutionary leaps achieved by humanity in understanding the universe, and in improving our lives. Yet, to the general public, much of it is either unknown by its applications, not understood by its significance, shrouded in false mysticism and pseudoscience by numerous frauds, and/or a subject of internet memes (Schrödinger’s cat is, and isn’t, for the rescue). The word “quantum” gets thrown around a lot by many people without fully understanding its meaning. This is where the particle physicists Brian Cox and Jeff Forshaw come in with their book “The Quantum Universe: Everything That Can Happen Does Happen”. Mainly, the book has three principal aim: A presentation of what quantum mechanics are and how they work, a demystification of quantum physics replying to all pseudoscience related to it, and providing examples and explanations on how quantum physics are part of our world.The authors did their best to try and show us the workings of quantum physics and especially highlighting that the universe is at no obligation to make sense to us. We can understand more and more how it functions, but that doesn’t have to be intuitive to our minds. They highlight as well how hugely titanic were/are the efforts in quantum physics to try and understand the inner and most delicate parts of the universe’s components. Nevertheless, I did find that this isn’t the most accessible of books regarding particle physics. A physics specialist would read it with ease, someone very much interested in physics, especially quantum physics, should be able to follow through, but it might not be the best option for someone who has never read anything on quantum physics before. This issue in my opinion is summarized by two points: The first is the reliance on mathematical equations several times during the book, and the second is the over reliance on a single analogy to represent quantum mechanics to the reader. This is why the book to me, which is a good book, is more of a demonstration of the workings of quantum mechanics (And see it’s natural to use math. This allows the authors to combat any pseudoscience.) rather than an imaginative explanation of quantum physics to the average reader. But I enjoyed reading it. It did teach me more stuff. It did help me understand more stuff. And I know I will be reading more and more on this fascinating field to understand better our cosmos."
221,1846144329,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12173625-peter-crofts,5,"Superb. Absolutely superb. The authors don't treat you like a dunce, nor as a particle physicist. It really hit the sweet spot for me. I've read a lot of texts aimed at the layman and this is the one where things started to, for once, really kick in. I've been trying to get my head around the theory my entire adult life. I think I may now finally have a very basic grasp of the most significant elements of quantum theory and that, for me, is a cause for almost celebration. This is a book that respects its readers and expects some mental effort from them. There's some math you might want to work through and there's some modelling and visualizations to help you along. If you read these sections carefully, and do what they suggest, you're going to find yourself more embedded in the subject matter than some of the more armchair treatments of the subject matter.IMHO everyone needs to get their head around the basic tenets of the theory. There is a lot of nonsense out there that claims to rely on it to argue things like the mind having control over matter. Some of the implications of the theory are very hard to understand, they fly right in the face of observation and intuition, but that doesn't mean everything is possible. Far from it, the microworld has laws as well, but they operate on the basis of probability rather than deterministic predictions.Again, this is a superb book."
222,1846144329,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5949552-andrew-ives,4,"Brian Cox's many TV series, and his really enjoyable Human Universe book, are all quite accessible to most people. This, on the other hand, is a much much more difficult kettle of fish and suffers from the same shortcomings that A Brief History of Time does: it tries to avoid equations and explain complex mathematical concepts by using 'easy to understand' metaphors - in this case, clocks. This shorthand doesn't really work, and after much labouring, I soon wished Brian had taught me how to do the maths properly instead. Textually, this book is pretty impeccable. It's written in a moderately colloquial, but still highbrow, style and immaculately proofread. Around the 150-200 page area, I became quite lost, slightly disbelieving of the theories, consequently slipping in and out of comprehension no matter how many times I reread certain paragraphs. The epilogue chapter about calculating the Chandrasekhar limit is quite mindboggling. I think I managed to catch about 60% of it if I really concentrated hard, but he does qualify that by saying it's one of the pinnacles of human mental achievement. I can well believe it! 4.25/5"
223,1846144329,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75039510-toby-bond,3,"Some of this book is mind bending, especially when they talk about the double slit experiment and go into heisenberg. Some of the book you have to re-read several times to make sure you kind of understand what is going on, the clocks and wave interference were fine, its when they start extrapolating their ideas that it gets tricky. Usually i snatch reading time when i can, therefore stopping and starting the book frequently meant going back a few pages to re-acquaint yourself with what the hell is going on. The book is written in a folksy style, as if quantum physics is the stuff of daily conversation, peppered with unfunny jokes and a moderate amount of smugness. I like science orientated books and have read a fair amount of Brian Cox's work, this isn't his best. I would prefer to read Galfard's 'The universe in your hand', it doesnt go into as much detail, but it is better written, more engaging and accessible."

I believe it's my problem, i don't have a good basic about particle physics, nor mathematics. This book is rather difficult for to hit the point. The first half seems still ok, but second half i am totally lost.

225,1846144329,http://goodreads.com/user/show/78342970-nina,3,"This book. What a frustrating experience. Because some of the material in this was familiar from other places, like the BBC2 lecture thing Cox presented some weeks back, I could understand some of what was in this book, but unfortunately, it was just enough to be able to grasp that I was missing a lot! Ideas formed in my head, but very often they never quite came to fruition. The book became an increasingly difficult read as it went on, but I enjoyed it enough to glean what I could. And I enjoyed it enough to feel a terrible regret about my ability to understand not quite stretching as far as I wanted it to. I'm not entirely sure if this is written for the science-literate or the layperson, all I know is it left me behind at some point, as well as leaving me feeling a little thick. So, three stars of limited understanding for a probable five star read."
226,1846144329,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1188122-kara-babcock,2,"The universe is big. Mindbogglingly big. Our minds have trouble conceiving of the vastness of the universe, on either scales of time and space, or their unified presentation as spacetime. And the moment we think we might possibly be able to get used to this idea, it becomes apparent that the very foundations of our universe are small. So small, so tiny, that the energy required to probe these depths is nearly as impressively vast as the scale of the universe they conspire to create. This is The Quantum Universe that Brian Cox and Jeff Forshaw want to explore with us.Quantum mechanics is notorious among physicists and laypeople alike for appearing to be nonsensical and unintuitive (or at least counter-intuitive). The chapter titles of this book illustrate this line of thought: “Being in Two Places at Once,” “Everything That Can Happen Does Happen,” “Movement as an Illusion,” etc. But such ideas are fundamentally biased by our perspective as macro-sized beings. If we experienced the world at the quantum level, then quantum mechanics would seem quite normal. Since our larger world is based on the confluence of so many quantum-level events, the picture this builds up is so far removed from those quantum effects that we get a false sense of reality.So Cox and Forshaw follow Heisenberg in establishing thatthe job of quantum theory should be to predict directly observable things…. It should not be expected to provide some kind of satisfying mental picture for the internal workings of the atom, because this is not necessary and it may not even be possible.This is really difficult to accept. I know because I read a lot about physics and science, and I still picture a really tiny, featureless sphere when I picture an electron. But, of course, the whole idea of “picturing” an electron is the part that doesn’t make sense. Particles are not solid lumps of matter that happen to be really small. Particles are waves and waves are particles because both are descriptions of specific phenomena, often at a particular space and time in the universe.Cox and Forshaw do a pretty good job, then, of deconstructing this false notion of particles. I also appreciate how they ground this deconstruction in the historical development of quantum mechanics. I knew the names, and had a vague idea of what the heavyweights behind quantum mechanics were known for—Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle, Rutherford and the structure of the atom, Dirac and antimatter, Schrödinger and the wave equation, etc. But Cox and Forshaw provide a more detailed context and chronology. They would describe, for instance, how Rutherford quickly realized the solar system model of the atom was wrong, or how Born or Dirac or Feynman would feed off each other’s discoveries very quickly. The 1920s was a really interesting time in the rapid development of quantum theory!Starting around chapter 3, the book tries to explain these basic ideas in quantum theory to a reader who is assumed to have little scientific or mathematical background. Cox and Forshaw try to be reassuring, claiming that if someone is intimidated by the math, they can safely skip it. To their credit, although they refer to calculus and other higher math, the actual math they show is comprehensible to someone who took high school physics. Nevertheless, if you do skip the math … well, you’ll end up reading very little of what’s already a short book.I fear The Quantum Universe suffers from trying to have its cake and eat it as well. Cox and Forshaw are so invested in not having to explain complex-based trigonometry to a lay audience that they manage to invent an analogy even more complicated than this math! I pulled down my copy of 
The Illustrated A Brief History of Time and The Universe in a Nutshell
, really the best, to see how Stephen Hawking deals with this. He dodges it by just not discussing the math behind it (famously, of course, declaiming in his original introduction that each equation would apparently halve book sales). Yet somehow he manages to discuss the double-slit experiment, quantized electron orbits, and sum-over-histories just fine.Buried deep in later chapters, Cox and Forshaw explain the difference between the Copenhagen and many-worlds interpretations (though they don’t identify the former as such). And then they take a half-hearted stab and describing the Standard Model but acknowledge it’s going beyond the remit of the book. (
Knocking on Heaven’s Door
, although laden with a lot of other information and tangents, provides one of the most cogent explanations of the Standard Model I’ve read.)It’s a shame, because in between the confusing analogies and inexorable unravelling, The Quantum Universe treats the subject of quantum mechanics with wit and a graceful touch. Cox and Forshaw write well together. There is a sense of humour to the descriptions, particularly when they take a stab at the intelligence of drum players (since Cox used to be in a rock band). Despite making assurances about being able to skip the math, they never patronize the reader. This could have been a brilliant introduction to quantum mechanics for the layperson. As it is, while it’s not a total trainwreck, I wouldn’t recommend starting here either.

Ideas formed in my head, but very often they never quite came to fruition. The book became an increasingly difficult read as it went on, but I enjoyed it enough to glean what I could. And I enjoyed it enough to feel a terrible regret about my ability to understand not quite stretching as far as I wanted it to.

256,1846144329,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1188122-kara-babcock,2,"The universe is big. Mindbogglingly big. Our minds have trouble conceiving of the vastness of the universe, on either scales of time and space, or their unified presentation as spacetime. And the moment we think we might possibly be able to get used to this idea, it becomes apparent that the very foundations of our universe are small. So small, so tiny, that the energy required to probe these depths is nearly as impressively vast as the scale of the universe they conspire to create. This is The Quantum Universe that Brian Cox and Jeff Forshaw want to explore with us.Quantum mechanics is notorious among physicists and laypeople alike for appearing to be nonsensical and unintuitive (or at least counter-intuitive). The chapter titles of this book illustrate this line of thought: “Being in Two Places at Once,” “Everything That Can Happen Does Happen,” “Movement as an Illusion,” etc. But such ideas are fundamentally biased by our perspective as macro-sized beings. If we experienced the world at the quantum level, then quantum mechanics would seem quite normal. Since our larger world is based on the confluence of so many quantum-level events, the picture this builds up is so far removed from those quantum effects that we get a false sense of reality.So Cox and Forshaw follow Heisenberg in establishing thatthe job of quantum theory should be to predict directly observable things…. It should not be expected to provide some kind of satisfying mental picture for the internal workings of the atom, because this is not necessary and it may not even be possible.This is really difficult to accept. I know because I read a lot about physics and science, and I still picture a really tiny, featureless sphere when I picture an electron. But, of course, the whole idea of “picturing” an electron is the part that doesn’t make sense. Particles are not solid lumps of matter that happen to be really small. Particles are waves and waves are particles because both are descriptions of specific phenomena, often at a particular space and time in the universe.Cox and Forshaw do a pretty good job, then, of deconstructing this false notion of particles. I also appreciate how they ground this deconstruction in the historical development of quantum mechanics. I knew the names, and had a vague idea of what the heavyweights behind quantum mechanics were known for—Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle, Rutherford and the structure of the atom, Dirac and antimatter, Schrödinger and the wave equation, etc. But Cox and Forshaw provide a more detailed context and chronology. They would describe, for instance, how Rutherford quickly realized the solar system model of the atom was wrong, or how Born or Dirac or Feynman would feed off each other’s discoveries very quickly. The 1920s was a really interesting time in the rapid development of quantum theory!Starting around chapter 3, the book tries to explain these basic ideas in quantum theory to a reader who is assumed to have little scientific or mathematical background. Cox and Forshaw try to be reassuring, claiming that if someone is intimidated by the math, they can safely skip it. To their credit, although they refer to calculus and other higher math, the actual math they show is comprehensible to someone who took high school physics. Nevertheless, if you do skip the math … well, you’ll end up reading very little of what’s already a short book.I fear The Quantum Universe suffers from trying to have its cake and eat it as well. Cox and Forshaw are so invested in not having to explain complex-based trigonometry to a lay audience that they manage to invent an analogy even more complicated than this math! I pulled down my copy of 
The Illustrated A Brief History of Time and The Universe in a Nutshell
, really the best, to see how Stephen Hawking deals with this. He dodges it by just not discussing the math behind it (famously, of course, declaiming in his original introduction that each equation would apparently halve book sales). Yet somehow he manages to discuss the double-slit experiment, quantized electron orbits, and sum-over-histories just fine.Buried deep in later chapters, Cox and Forshaw explain the difference between the Copenhagen and many-worlds interpretations (though they don’t identify the former as such). And then they take a half-hearted stab and describing the Standard Model but acknowledge it’s going beyond the remit of the book. (
Knocking on Heaven’s Door
, although laden with a lot of other information and tangents, provides one of the most cogent explanations of the Standard Model I’ve read.)It’s a shame, because in between the confusing analogies and inexorable unravelling, The Quantum Universe treats the subject of quantum mechanics with wit and a graceful touch. Cox and Forshaw write well together. There is a sense of humour to the descriptions, particularly when they take a stab at the intelligence of drum players (since Cox used to be in a rock band). Despite making assurances about being able to skip the math, they never patronize the reader. This could have been a brilliant introduction to quantum mechanics for the layperson. As it is, while it’s not a total trainwreck, I wouldn’t recommend starting here either.

257,1846144329,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75505674-victor-kurzweil,1,"What started as an exciting explanation of quantum mechanics very quickly became a total failure as the authors brought it an analogy of clocks to explain quantum fields and probabilities. As other reviewers have stated, the clock analogy is developed as a system to enable people to understand the concepts in quantum physics, but instead ends up being more complicated than the subject itself. Probably the worst use of analogy I've ever read. Everytime a new chapter starts its not long before clocks are brought up again, and I found myself skimming through until there were no clock references. An analogy too far! "
258,1846144329,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13257565-damian-pearce,4,"Great book worth taking your time with. There's no mathematics in it so you don't need a background in that to understand what the co-authors are describing to you. There is a chapter at the end - an epilogue - that does contain some mathematics, quite a bit and it describes why White Dwarfs exist. This chapter is optional to read but I read it anyway.I think the job of a science book for the public is to enhance or change the understanding of the reader of the subject and I think this book certainly did that. A little easier going than Brian Greene's Elegant Universe... but just as informative. Good stuff!"

I would recommend a piece of paper and a pen to make some notes as you read through it.Somewhere in the middle I found it extraordinary that a book can explain the principle quantum laws and ideas with virtually no math involved. But in the end it would be a lot simpler to just educate the average reader with the complex numbers and wave mechanics, because the analogy with clocks starts to make less and less sense and in the end the writer himself realizes that he cant really explain QF without equations :) Still. I think it deserves 4/5"
260,1846144329,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61205946-sam-close,3,"A good introduction to some quantum phenomena for a beginner, but becomes very quickly complex and hard to grasp even for someone with a more mathematical background. This can be seen with the explanation of the phase of a wave using a clock; referring to moving forwards in time confuses the notion of winding back the clocks. I reckon 5-10 pages maximum of explaining what the clocks actually were, it would've been a lot more coherent throughout. Otherwise an enjoyable read with some eureka moments throughout."
261,1846144329,http://goodreads.com/user/show/196037-jrobertus,3,"Watching a Great Courses series stimulated me to refresh my long gone studies in quantum mechanics. This book is quite good for lay readers. It adopts the Feynman method of analysis which I had at UCSD and which is a good one. In order to avoid too much math the authors adopt some rather strained clock metaphors which I found more confusing than the actual math. However, I have used complex numbers for wave analysis as part of my work for 50 years so that helps. Anyway, if you are a nerd and want to understand some of the basics of quantum weirdness, this is a good place to go."

This one does present explanations/interpretations for Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle (and some other effects that I knew about) in ways I had not seen before and presented an explanation that I could nearly grasp as to why every particle knows about every other particle in the universe.

Some of the book you have to re-read several times to make sure you kind of understand what is going on, the clocks and wave interference were fine, its when they start extrapolating their ideas that it gets tricky. Usually i snatch reading time when i can, therefore stopping and starting the book frequently meant going back a few pages to re-acquaint yourself with what the hell is going on. The book is written in a folksy style, as if quantum physics is the stuff of daily conversation, peppered with unfunny jokes and a moderate amount of smugness. I like science orientated books and have read a fair amount of Brian Cox's work, this isn't his best. I would prefer to read Galfard's 'The universe in your hand', it doesnt go into as much detail, but it is better written, more engaging and accessible."

Feynman.I don't think i would ever even understand the main frame about quantum physics after reading this book...half way.Brian Cox is one of my favorite scientists, I watched almost all his programs about universe and learned a lot about special relativity, general relativity, even how the solar system works, the planets ...etc. But this book.....i truly have difficult to digest it. I believe it's my problem, i don't have a good basic about particle physics, nor mathematics. This book is rather difficult for to hit the point. The first half seems still ok, but second half i am totally lost. I will give myself few more tries to read other books about quantum physics if i could improve a a bit, i will get back to Cox later."
285,1846144329,http://goodreads.com/user/show/78342970-nina,3,"This book. What a frustrating experience. Because some of the material in this was familiar from other places, like the BBC2 lecture thing Cox presented some weeks back, I could understand some of what was in this book, but unfortunately, it was just enough to be able to grasp that I was missing a lot! Ideas formed in my head, but very often they never quite came to fruition. The book became an increasingly difficult read as it went on, but I enjoyed it enough to glean what I could. And I enjoyed it enough to feel a terrible regret about my ability to understand not quite stretching as far as I wanted it to. I'm not entirely sure if this is written for the science-literate or the layperson, all I know is it left me behind at some point, as well as leaving me feeling a little thick. So, three stars of limited understanding for a probable five star read."
286,1846144329,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1188122-kara-babcock,2,"The universe is big. Mindbogglingly big. Our minds have trouble conceiving of the vastness of the universe, on either scales of time and space, or their unified presentation as spacetime. And the moment we think we might possibly be able to get used to this idea, it becomes apparent that the very foundations of our universe are small. So small, so tiny, that the energy required to probe these depths is nearly as impressively vast as the scale of the universe they conspire to create. This is The Quantum Universe that Brian Cox and Jeff Forshaw want to explore with us.Quantum mechanics is notorious among physicists and laypeople alike for appearing to be nonsensical and unintuitive (or at least counter-intuitive). The chapter titles of this book illustrate this line of thought: “Being in Two Places at Once,” “Everything That Can Happen Does Happen,” “Movement as an Illusion,” etc. But such ideas are fundamentally biased by our perspective as macro-sized beings. If we experienced the world at the quantum level, then quantum mechanics would seem quite normal. Since our larger world is based on the confluence of so many quantum-level events, the picture this builds up is so far removed from those quantum effects that we get a false sense of reality.So Cox and Forshaw follow Heisenberg in establishing thatthe job of quantum theory should be to predict directly observable things…. It should not be expected to provide some kind of satisfying mental picture for the internal workings of the atom, because this is not necessary and it may not even be possible.This is really difficult to accept. I know because I read a lot about physics and science, and I still picture a really tiny, featureless sphere when I picture an electron. But, of course, the whole idea of “picturing” an electron is the part that doesn’t make sense. Particles are not solid lumps of matter that happen to be really small. Particles are waves and waves are particles because both are descriptions of specific phenomena, often at a particular space and time in the universe.Cox and Forshaw do a pretty good job, then, of deconstructing this false notion of particles. I also appreciate how they ground this deconstruction in the historical development of quantum mechanics. I knew the names, and had a vague idea of what the heavyweights behind quantum mechanics were known for—Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle, Rutherford and the structure of the atom, Dirac and antimatter, Schrödinger and the wave equation, etc. But Cox and Forshaw provide a more detailed context and chronology. They would describe, for instance, how Rutherford quickly realized the solar system model of the atom was wrong, or how Born or Dirac or Feynman would feed off each other’s discoveries very quickly. The 1920s was a really interesting time in the rapid development of quantum theory!Starting around chapter 3, the book tries to explain these basic ideas in quantum theory to a reader who is assumed to have little scientific or mathematical background. Cox and Forshaw try to be reassuring, claiming that if someone is intimidated by the math, they can safely skip it. To their credit, although they refer to calculus and other higher math, the actual math they show is comprehensible to someone who took high school physics. Nevertheless, if you do skip the math … well, you’ll end up reading very little of what’s already a short book.I fear The Quantum Universe suffers from trying to have its cake and eat it as well. Cox and Forshaw are so invested in not having to explain complex-based trigonometry to a lay audience that they manage to invent an analogy even more complicated than this math! I pulled down my copy of 
The Illustrated A Brief History of Time and The Universe in a Nutshell
, really the best, to see how Stephen Hawking deals with this. He dodges it by just not discussing the math behind it (famously, of course, declaiming in his original introduction that each equation would apparently halve book sales). Yet somehow he manages to discuss the double-slit experiment, quantized electron orbits, and sum-over-histories just fine.Buried deep in later chapters, Cox and Forshaw explain the difference between the Copenhagen and many-worlds interpretations (though they don’t identify the former as such). And then they take a half-hearted stab and describing the Standard Model but acknowledge it’s going beyond the remit of the book. (
Knocking on Heaven’s Door
, although laden with a lot of other information and tangents, provides one of the most cogent explanations of the Standard Model I’ve read.)It’s a shame, because in between the confusing analogies and inexorable unravelling, The Quantum Universe treats the subject of quantum mechanics with wit and a graceful touch. Cox and Forshaw write well together. There is a sense of humour to the descriptions, particularly when they take a stab at the intelligence of drum players (since Cox used to be in a rock band). Despite making assurances about being able to skip the math, they never patronize the reader. This could have been a brilliant introduction to quantum mechanics for the layperson. As it is, while it’s not a total trainwreck, I wouldn’t recommend starting here either.

287,1846144329,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75505674-victor-kurzweil,1,"What started as an exciting explanation of quantum mechanics very quickly became a total failure as the authors brought it an analogy of clocks to explain quantum fields and probabilities. As other reviewers have stated, the clock analogy is developed as a system to enable people to understand the concepts in quantum physics, but instead ends up being more complicated than the subject itself. Probably the worst use of analogy I've ever read. Everytime a new chapter starts its not long before clocks are brought up again, and I found myself skimming through until there were no clock references. An analogy too far! "
288,1846144329,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13257565-damian-pearce,4,"Great book worth taking your time with. There's no mathematics in it so you don't need a background in that to understand what the co-authors are describing to you. There is a chapter at the end - an epilogue - that does contain some mathematics, quite a bit and it describes why White Dwarfs exist. This chapter is optional to read but I read it anyway.I think the job of a science book for the public is to enhance or change the understanding of the reader of the subject and I think this book certainly did that. A little easier going than Brian Greene's Elegant Universe... but just as informative. Good stuff!"
289,1846144329,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48678927-bor-zupan,4,"It was on my reading list for quite a while. It took me far too much time, which was mostly spent on rereading past paragraphs. I would recommend a piece of paper and a pen to make some notes as you read through it.Somewhere in the middle I found it extraordinary that a book can explain the principle quantum laws and ideas with virtually no math involved. But in the end it would be a lot simpler to just educate the average reader with the complex numbers and wave mechanics, because the analogy with clocks starts to make less and less sense and in the end the writer himself realizes that he cant really explain QF without equations :) Still. I think it deserves 4/5"
290,1846144329,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61205946-sam-close,3,"A good introduction to some quantum phenomena for a beginner, but becomes very quickly complex and hard to grasp even for someone with a more mathematical background. This can be seen with the explanation of the phase of a wave using a clock; referring to moving forwards in time confuses the notion of winding back the clocks. I reckon 5-10 pages maximum of explaining what the clocks actually were, it would've been a lot more coherent throughout. Otherwise an enjoyable read with some eureka moments throughout."
291,1846144329,http://goodreads.com/user/show/196037-jrobertus,3,"Watching a Great Courses series stimulated me to refresh my long gone studies in quantum mechanics. This book is quite good for lay readers. It adopts the Feynman method of analysis which I had at UCSD and which is a good one. In order to avoid too much math the authors adopt some rather strained clock metaphors which I found more confusing than the actual math. However, I have used complex numbers for wave analysis as part of my work for 50 years so that helps. Anyway, if you are a nerd and want to understand some of the basics of quantum weirdness, this is a good place to go."
292,1846144329,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65498977-samarjeet-das-ray,3,"The authors made the book unnecessarily complicated at places especially at the end. I couldn’t understand the reason to explain the calculation of Chandrasekhar limit. Also, tribute should have been paid to Indian scientist SN Bose as he and Einstein discovered the statistical rules for particles which do not follow Pauli’s Exclusion principle leading to Dirac naming a set of particles as Boson. After all, Higgs particles are a type of Boson. "
293,1846144329,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62747656-shreyansh-jain,4,"Certainly an entertaining read.Brain Cox has a way of showing how to eat the elephant to his readers and this book didnt disappoint either. It was perhaps a little too dumbed down but halfway into it rapidly picks up speed. He should have exposed more of behind the scene equations since converting them all to ""English"" makes this a somewhat laborious read. After all, most readers of this book would have some aptitude for actual math anyway (or an interest to learn). A good intro overall. "
294,1846144329,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76263262-tim,2,"I am not sure what I expect out of these books trying to describe quantum theory but I'm generally disappointed in them. This one does present explanations/interpretations for Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle (and some other effects that I knew about) in ways I had not seen before and presented an explanation that I could nearly grasp as to why every particle knows about every other particle in the universe. About half way through, though, the narrative became not much use or interest to me."
295,1846144329,http://goodreads.com/user/show/107537185-callum-hair,3,"The authors faced a monumental task in this book: making quantum mechanics accessible to the general public. They fall short in a few ways, with a few too many analogies about clocks and other less than accessible passages. I feel that wavelength diagrams may have been simpler to get some of the science across. Having said that, there was a lot to gain from this book about the history of quantum mechanics, and how it has exponentially improved our lives."
296,1846144329,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38766886-adam-wigington,2,"I thought the clock analogy for particle waves confounding perhaps because I have a better mathematics understanding than the target reader. Explaining waves in complex numbers is more familiar to me, so I had to keep translating it when reading the clocks analogy. There were plenty of good explanations and interesting quantum physics explained."
297,1846144329,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12969777-dan-cooley,3,Interesting but I found the way it was explained a but convoluted. The use of clocks as a way to explain what happens is kind of more confusing than what is actually going on. I think maybe I need to read this again or maybe read another book on the subject. It hasn't dampened my curiosity though even though some of it was hard to fathom.
298,1846144329,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51028347-nadja,2,"I felt that I missed out on too much of this book to fully appreciate it. If I had more of a scientifically or mathematically oriented brain, maybe I would have grasped more. I think I require science books that are geared even more towards the lay person. As far as lay people go, I'm on the extremely lay end of the spectrum."
299,1846144329,http://goodreads.com/user/show/77709644-saurabh-sanjiv,5,"A Fascinating book about mysteries about quantum mechanics. Brian Cox narrows it down to day to day analogy of our understanding of the world, and most interesting is how just a few fundamental particles and four forces in nature can create the huge matrix of uncertainty which can take billions of years for super comuters to solve."
