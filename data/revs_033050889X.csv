0,033050889X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48650982-always-pouting,3,"This one covers people who loses their senses and still find different ways of communicating or navigating the world. It was actually pretty cool to see the ingenuity and problem solving that can take place when people have to compensate for loss of various brain functions. I really liked Lilian's story and I was pretty interested in the dementia symptoms she showed but the rest of the book I could've done without. I didn't really get anything new out of the rest of it perspective wise and though he writes well, I don't really need to know that much about Oliver Sack's eye surgery because it wasn't like him being partially blind revealed anything new to me the reader about how the brain works, though it clearly gave him more perspective on how it must be for other patients. I also thought the whole facial recognition thing was dumb, like I'm sure that he's not exaggerating his inability to recognize places and faces but like who cares if it's real. We all have our strengths and weaknesses, he sucks with facial recognition woah. Maybe I just know enough about neuroscience at this point that this didn't really contribute anything new, and so someone else who knows less might find this much more fascinating. I just wish there was more substance to the book and Sacks concentrated on patient case histories rather than making such a large portion of the book about his own experiences which only seemed some what relevant to the theme of the book."
1,033050889X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2172096-barbara,3,"Dr. Oliver Sacks was a practicing neurologist and professor who wrote a number of popular books about people afflicted with neurological disorders and/or brain damage. Dr. Oliver Sacks In this book Sacks relates stories about patients who developed problems with their eyes or the 'vision' areas of the brain, including loss of the ability to read, inability to recognize everday objects, and impairment of stereoscopic and/or peripheral vision. Sacks also tells a very personal story about his own eye tumor.Sacks starts with the story of Lillian Kallir, a gifted concert pianist who slowly lost her ability to read music, then words (writing), and finally the ability to identify mundane objects like a fruit or a violin. Through it all, Lillian retained her writing skills and maintained a lively correspondence - though she couldn't read what she wrote. (I'll admit, this seems REALLY strange to me.)Lillian KallirIn normal life Lillian functioned, in part, by memorizing the location of objects around her. Sacks tells a story of having tea at Lillian's house and inadvertently moving a plate of biscuits, after which Lillian could no longer 'see' the biscuits - though they were still on the table. Lillian never recovered her lost abilities but was able to live a (more or less) normal life because of her musical gifts, excellent memory, and the help of her husband, friends, and doctors. Sacks also relates stories about other individuals who lost their ability to read and/or recognize objects - usually due to a stroke or brain injury - and how they coped (or didn't) with the problem. Some patients eventually recovered their capabilities, some didn't.Another interesting topic Sacks address is the inability of some people (including himself) to recognize faces, a condition called prosopagnosia. This problem apparently plagued Sacks for all his life. He tells one story about leaving the office of his long-time psychiatrist, then meeting a gentleman in the lobby who addressed him in a friendly manner. Sacks had no idea who this was....until his psychiatrist identified himself. This problem can be so significant that some patients can't even identify their spouse or children in an 'out of context' situation. Prosopagnosia apparently affects a significant proportion of the population, and sufferers must develop coping mechanisms as best they can. (The actor, Brad Pitt, said he suffers from this condition.)In the most personal part of the book Sacks relates his own experience with an eye tumor, his radiation and laser treatments, and the eventual loss of almost all vision in his right eye. This resulted in a diminution of both stereoscopic and peripheral vision. Again, in his humorous self-deprecating style, Sacks relates incidents of missing stairs, bumping into and tripping over furniture and dogs, and not seeing things around him. He relates the discomfiture of having people or objects 'disappear' from his right side, then suddenly appear again.Sacks goes on to relate the stories of several people who either gained or lost stereoscopic vision. One woman who obtained stereoscopic vision after seeing everything in only two dimensions was mesmerized by seeing, for the first time, her steering wheel projecting from the dashboard and her rear-view mirror sticking out from the windshield. Overall, (for me) these sections are the weakest part of the book, being too long and repetitive. Along with the various stories in the book Sacks discusses parts of the brain that are specialized for specific 'visual' functions, how these brain areas interact, and how malfunction or damage in these areas affects people's vision, reading, object recognition, and so on.All in all, an interesting and informative book.You can follow my reviews at https://reviewsbybarbsaffer.blogspot...."
2,033050889X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/175635-trevor,4,"I listened to this one as a talking book. There were many, many times when I nearly stopped listening to it. The problem was that Sacks himself didn’t read very much of the book – his eye troubles have made reading difficult for him. By far the best parts of this talking book were when he was doing the reading. You would nearly think that the producers of this audio book picked the person to read the other bits of the book as a way to convince Sacks he should just do the whole damn thing himself. The guy who reads most of this one is easily the worst reader of talking books I’ve ever heard – and that includes some of the really poor readers they get on Libravox. The best way I can explain his ‘style’ is to think of a scene from Get Smart where Max thinks he is unassailable. Think of that smug, too-clever-by-half voice of his and that is nearly exactly the voice this guy used the whole way through. Often it nearly completely distracted me from the meaning of what I was listening to.I’ve an astigmatism, quite an impressive one, really. It is part of the reason I know what it means to learn to read, whereas so many other people I know have no memory of ever learning to read – my astigmatism and my going to seven different primary schools made learning to read increasingly difficult and seemingly unlikely for me as things went along. It wasn’t until I was in grade four that a teacher finally worked out the problem – I was too stupid to squint and so my near blindness was never picked up.It took years before I finally found out that I had an astigmatism, before that I just knew I couldn’t see very well – when I was first told I thought the word was ‘stigmata’ and so, when I looked it up in the dictionary, thought it was somehow related to a scar on the eye. I wonder now why an optometrist might think to tell an adolescent boy they have an astigmatism and yet not go on to explain what that defect actually amounts to – effectively a misshapen lens.Another time – or perhaps the same time, I can’t really remember now – I was told that I would never read below the fifth line of a particular chart. It is only now that I realise that one is shown so many charts when getting one’s eyes checked that everyone would be in more or less the same boat. No matter how good your eyes there will always be a chart in which you can only see to the fifth line eventually. But I took this to mean that even with glasses I would always have less than perfect vision. It was only last year that I was told that with my glasses on I had 20/20 vision. I actually had to ask the optometrist to repeat that to me. I had always ‘known’ that my eyesight was so bad, even with glasses on, that it was less than ‘normal’. So her telling me that was not (and had not been) the case completely threw me. The point being that I’ve never quite known what ‘normal’ might be, but I had always just assumed that normal was something different from what I could actually see. To find out that I am, in fact, Mr Normal came as quite a surprise.This book is about seeing. For those of us who can see there seems to be nothing more normal in the world. And those of us who can see generally can think of nothing worse than not being able to see. The choice between being dead and being blind seems, in so many ways, quite a difficult choice to make in theory. But what is very interesting in this book is that while we might well think there is one way to be blind and millions of ways of seeing – in fact, seeing is such a complicated and strange phenomenon that there are even people with no eyes at all who can still ‘see’ in certain senses.I’m going to have to learn more about dyslexia. A lot of this book is about people with degenerative disorders – strokes and such – that stop them being able to read. Cases where they can see the letters and even see the words, but are no longer able to make any sense of them. These are the kinds of stories that make you think someone is taking the piss. The problem is that the complexity of the task involved in reading is such that highly particular dysfunctions in one part of the brain can lead to highly peculiar behaviours in the person suffering from that dysfunction.Sacks even has a chapter on his own problem with sight – brought about by a cancer growth in his eye. This is a particularly interesting chapter for a great number of reasons, but not least because he talks about a curious stereo vision thing happening when he was smoking cannabis one night. You might like to google an image of Mr Sacks now for the full implications of this little confession to take effect. I don’t know about you, but he just isn’t the sort of person I would immediately associate with smoking a little blue. Needing to wear glasses has always made sight seem something of infinite value to me. I remember the first time I looked at my brother’s face after getting them and seeing he had freckles. There was a real sense that I had never really seen his face before. Or the time I first wore contact lenses and how sharp and clear my focus was looking over the Alexandra Gardens in a 64 tram down St Kilda Road – but the pain of them proved too much for me to bother with despite the manifest improvement in sight they gave. Anyway, I look naked without glasses on, and, oddly enough, generally I am. There is an article here about a women who got stereo vision quite late on in life. There is some evidence that many artists did not have stereo vision (they can tell by looking at photos of them and making measurements of their eyes) and so they saw the world as a flat two-dimensional plane. This woman would sit for hours fascinated by the sense of depth, of how things jumped out at her into the third dimension she had never known existed before. I really could identify with this woman in my own small way.Sacks does some name dropping in this book, but not of the boring sort of thick actress or member of the royal family others do – but people I would give my right arm to have known. He mentions writing to the Russian psychologist Luria at one point (someone who has become a bit of a hero to me), he also mentions a tall guy called Jonathan Miller (who I assume is THE Jonathan Miller and who has always been one of my heroes) and then in passing mentions that he wrote to Simon Winchester to congratulate him on one of his talking books.Now, I’m going to end in a second, but I wanted to talk about talking books for a bit first. Sacks says he doesn’t generally like them. He talks of a blind woman in this book who finds her eyes get tired when she listens to them. She visually constructs the text in her head that she is listening to and effectively reads along with the voice. I don’t do anything like this. I listen to talking books for hours of every day – while I drive, while I cook, while I walk to the station. They are my constant companions. People have mentioned to me that they are only meant for the blind or the illiterate – something that makes we feel very sorry for them.Sacks talks about visualisation and how this might well be the third great cognitive ability, he says he is following Colin McGinn (the philosopher) in this. I was thinking of other things when this was mentioned in the book and so missed what the other two were – though I think one of them was making sense of sensual data and maybe the other was linguistic ability – but I could be wrong. Anyway, this got me thinking about visualisation. My ex-wife once told me that I could improve my spelling (always hopeless until my late twenties) by doing what she did. She would just visualise the word in her mind and then copy it onto the paper. She might as well have said, “flying is simple, you just fall at the ground and miss” as Douglas Adams would have it. Marx says somewhere that the difference between a bee making a hive and a person making a house is that even the worst builder making a house has an image in their mind of the final product – the bee does not. Unfortunately, I am that bee. The odd thing is that I’m quite good at connecting visual images – I tend to use images in powerpoint presentations in metaphorical ways, but the thing is that this is in no way natural for me and (as odd as this might sound) in no way ‘visual’ – if you know what I mean. I can’t call up the image, but I will often have a feeling that I can use a certain image to make a certain point, but it is an almost subconscious awareness. In trying to call up, for example, to my mind’s eye now a famous image, say, the Mona Lisa, all I can ever really see is a kind of grey lead pencil tracing of it that fades to white as soon as my concentration is relaxed. Sight has more to do with the mind than we might like to imagine – and this is a fascinating look at when things go wrong that might just get you wondering about your own visual life. Enjoy."
3,033050889X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24882791-india-m-clamp,4,"In a review by “The Guardian” it alludes “we are all close to being someone else.” The 3 lb. mass---aka the brain---is explored fully with Dr. Sacks and thus the opaque is made pellucid. Even now posthumous author Sacks humble words and melodic British accent resonates in my ear (via audible) and ""The Mind’s Eye” embodied ichor. My pre-med studies in anatomy and physiology at Oxford had not prepared me in the least for real medicine. Seeing patients, listening to them...questions about the quality of life and whether life was even worth living in some circumstances. — Oliver Sacks, MD Reading and listening (via audible) to “The Mind’s Eye” on cases regarding agnosia to prosopagnosia (Dr. P) and patients that seem to imitate “hunchback of Notre dame” characters. Dr. Oliver Sacks has a “au courant” sense of observation—as we discover from his written patient records. One engaging case was Lilian Kallir (concert pianist). Some would describe Dr. Sacks as man with a Santa Claus beard, yet after witnessing Sacks “writing his notes on his arm” such characteristics embody the human spirit of his genius. “The Mind’s Eye” does not scream and it instructs gently---like the brush of a butterfly wing on bare skin. Brilliant! Buy and read."
4,033050889X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1237196-petra-x,3,"I like all Sacks' books about the neurological problems and adjustments of the people whose stories he tells. However, when he comes to relating his own problems, that's another matter. He goes into far too much detail as though he had confused his audience - most of us are neither personal fans of Oliver Sacks himself (rather than his work) nor are we neurologists ourselves. We just got sucked into neurology-as-a-popular-science by the brilliant Awakenings, or the film of that book starring Robin Williams, who will forever personify Sacks, at least in my mind. A 3.5 star book (would have been four without the endless meanderings of Sacks as his own subject) and I'm not feeling generous, so three stars. If you enjoy Sacks, you might also enjoy another writer-neurologist, Dr. Harold L. Klawans."
5,033050889X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/367941-michelle,5,"When I first saw the cover of this book, I thought it was called ""O, Liver Sacks"". It took me an embarrassingly long amount of time to figure out it was called ""The Mind's Eye"". I loved the case studies in this book, and most of all how the people were portrayed as humans, not patients. My favorite chapter was probably the one on Lillian. The chapter on Oliver Sacks's eye cancer was really depressing, but it was still good. I definitely want to read more of this author. Favorite parts:""Lillian could still identify objects by inference, using her intact perception of color, shape, texture, and movement, along with her memory and intelligence. Dr. P could not. He could not, for instance, identify a glove by sight or feel (despite being able to describe it in almost absurdly abstract terms, as 'a continuous surface infolded on itself [with] five outpouchings, if this is the word... a container of some sort?')-- until, by accident, he got it on his hand."" (pg 18)""Changizi et al. have found similar topological invariants in a range of natural settings, and this has led them to hypothesize that the shapes of letters 'have been selected to resemble the conglomerations of contours found in natural scenes, thereby tapping into our already-existing object recognition mechanisms."" (pg 74) I read a linguistics book that said something like this, too, and how shorthand is hard to read because it's not made up of contours found in nature.""(It makes me think back to the radioactive clock dials my Uncle Abe used to make, and how I would press these against my closed eyelids as a child and see similar scintillations...could this have played a part in causing my tumor?)"" (pgs 156, 157)"
6,033050889X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1215485-megan,4,"I just wrote a blog post about my school memories and how deafness affected my school experience, and one paragraph seemed particularly relevant to this book, so I'll repost it here:My favorite part of these school trips was the ride [to the audiologist]. The car we rode in was large, at least to my mind, and the back seat faced backwards. Even as a kid I enjoyed other perspectives; I would hang upside down off the jungle gym to see what everything looked like upside down, and purposefully choose other seats on the opposite side of my classroom every once in awhile to see what small things were different over there. So, riding backwards in a car going forwards was absolutely fascinating to me.I soak up visual stuff, I really do. A lot of deaf people tend to do that, particularly if they were deafened prelingually (I fall right on the cusp; I likely had mild hearing loss as I learned to comprehend speech, but not the profound loss I have now). I love photography and the way computer editing can transform a photo from what the subject looks like in real life. I love different perspectives, as I mentioned above. I absolutely cannot stand when I can only hear something and not look at it, and television programs or college lectures that simply feature one person sitting there talking easily put me to sleep.This book made me panicky. Seriously. Oliver Sacks has a chapter in here about how he grappled with the possibility of total blindness, and has to deal with monoscopic vision. The last chapter is about how blind people create a world of sight within them, drawing on previous experiences and what they can touch. The rest of the book follows the same theme of how the brain interprets what we see and how it can fail. Oh, man, I did not want to be thinking about the possibility of not being able to see. No hearing? No big deal. Whatevs. No sight? Panic attack.Since the book evoked a strong reaction in me, I liked it; I don't care what the reaction was. At times it could get a bit dry. One paragraph would be easily readable and relatable and the next would be filled with scientific terminology and buzzwords. I appreciate that Sacks has a large collection of correspondence people have sent to him, telling them their own experiences with various neurological occurences. At times, though, I think the people who write to him are prone to exaggerate, to try to sound interesting. I hope he doesn't take everything at face value, but it doesn't seem like he does.I didn't realize that Sacks was as old as he is. He's in his seventies, at the time of this writing. I do hope he is able to share many more of his experiences."
7,033050889X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2908629-ellie,3,"Like The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat and Other Clinical Tales, The Mind's Eye is a collection of case studies by neurologist Oliver Sacks (who is perhaps best known for his bringing Temple Grandin, an extremely successful woman with autism to the attention of the public and for the film with Robin Williams based on his book Awakenings). Sacks is both a gifted writer and a gifted clinician who brings a warmth, compassion and genuine interest to people who have various disabilities as the result of illness or trauma to the brain. Each essay describes a person coping with some highly unusual ailment-a musician who can no longer read music, or words, but can still write, a woman who loses the ability to use or understand language, a writer who can't read, the loss of stereoscopic vision.What Sacks brings to the studies, beyond his excellent prose and skill at accurately and vividly bringing these individuals (and their families) to life) is an almost heart-breaking warmth and compassion. He is as interested in the ways in which people learn to cope, the skills they develop to compensate for their losses as he is in their disability. More so, in fact.Sacks' last essay is his most personal: what happens when a person's vision is reduced to monoscopic vision as the result of cancer. And he writes particularly poignantly in this essay since the patient is himself.His respect for people is what comes through most strongly. And as painful and frightening as I found some of these studies (these people could be any one of us, including myself, including him), I was also heartened by the courage shown in impossibly difficult situations.One of the patients, a writer afflicted with alexia-the inabiity to read-said it beautifully: ""The problems never went away. I just got cleverer at solving them."""
8,033050889X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22591633-zanna,5,"These latest fascinatingly annotated case histories from Sacks are as ever made wonderful by the rich and tenderly observed personal context of each patient. Most poignantly, he writes of his own experiences of lifelong prosopagnosia (poor facial recognition and sense of direction) and the distressing loss of his stereoscopy due to cancer.Moving and at times painful, this book is as compulsively readable as Sacks' first publication, illustrating how endlessly wonderful and strange is the half-mysterious country of the mind. In this work the theme of visual perception is mined, starting from alexia and proceeding to the surprisingly diverse visual experiences of blindness."
9,033050889X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/933226-kirsti,4,"I'm always impressed by the author's compassion for his patients. One of them has perfect vision but also has a brain disorder that means she can no longer recognize specific objects. She can see an apple, but she isn't sure if it's an apple or a tomato or a pepper. She can see a toy elephant, but it might be a toy dog or a toy giraffe. But she claims to do well in and around her neighborhood. To test this, Sacks takes her grocery shopping . . . and to make sure she doesn't get confused about who or where he is, he dresses from head to toe in red. Who else would think of this?I also liked his account of the mystery novelist who had a stroke and lost the ability to read but not to write. The novelist relearned reading by tracing the letters in his mouth with his tongue (!) and went on to write another novel and a memoir.Because Sacks's eyesight is worsening, he's become drawn to cases that are related to vision. I know some reviewers didn't like this part of the book because so much of the focus is on him, but I didn't mind. It makes sense to me that he's trying to understand how different people react to and experience blindness, since he may soon be blind himself."
10,033050889X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2493714-cindy,5,"Mind's Eye is classic Sacks. It's a collection of essays with a focus on case studies. This time they were loosely based around the theme of the Mind's Eye - or how our perceptions of the world translate to imagery in the mind. As usual, he looks at people who have some sort of injury, illness or deficit to tell us about the normal functioning processes.Sacks has never shied away from including his own illnesses and problems in his books. (To wit: A Leg to Stand On and Migraine.) This time felt brutally personal as he shared both his life-long problem with prosopagnosia (face blindness), and his recent battle with a melanoma tumor on his retina. The latter altered then robbed him of his sight, and we see the normally upbeat the resilient doctor become alarmed, depressed, anxious and doubting. His Melanoma Diary is included verbatim, describing his thoughts as his vision changed day-to-day through the cancer treatments.The last chapter, which was also titled ""Mind's Eye"", is very detailed, filled with citations, and had more of a scholarly and philosophical tone than the other case-study/memoir chapters. However, it really brought together the deeper themes in the book: the difference between perception and mental imagery. I suspect this chapter has been published elsewhere before inclusion in the book.One of the best things I took away from the book is the difference between people who are strong visual imagers and people who do a more abstract type of mental imagery. In that last chapter, he discusses quite a few cases of blind people who have either maintained a very strong sense of visual imagery despite their deficits. He contrasts those with cases where the blind person has completely shifted their mental imagery towards aural, texture, and more abstract imagery. (It turns out Sacks admits he has almost no capabilities to pull up mental visual images, and he attributes some of this to his prosopagnosia.)It took me a long time to think about the differences, but I think there are strong parallels with my fellow physicists. At work, I have always been a very strong visual, ""graph it"" person -- I think best about a physical relationship or concept if I can imagine the graph or other physical representation. My husband, at the other extreme, likes to think much more abstractly in equations, and rarely graphs things in his head. As I've chatted with other folks over the years, physicists tend to fall into one or the other category - and I think this is what Sacks is talking about in the last chapter. "
11,033050889X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11820811-camelia-rose,4,"A fascinating read on the many ways our brain experiencing the visual world. The book includes several case studies: a musician's amazing adaptation after losing the ability of recognizing words later identifying visual objects caused by neurodegeneration; the story of Howard Engel, a writer who lost the ability of reading after a stroke and how he managed to continue to write; a patient who gained three-dimensional vision after not having it for many years; Oliver Sack's own story of suffering melanoma in one eye. The chapter about prosopagnosia is an eye-opening to me. The last chapter about the brain's inner vision is another favorite chapter of mine."
12,033050889X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/175480-helen-helena-nell,5,"I read this after reading Trevor McCandless's review. I was fascinated from page one onwards. Since then I have bored nearly everybody I know by talking about it, lent it to my daughter (who found it just as interesting) and ordered another copy for my mother.It is not just about eye-brain connections, though it is about that. It is about how different people respond in richly unique ways to sensory perception and sensory deprivation. But it is beautifully written, as simple as can be. Sacks is a natural story teller, but he is equally fascinated by people. He just talks about what they do and how they react. No great scientific theories or judgements. Just observation with humour and compassion.Beautiful piece of writing."
13,033050889X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75006997-mo,3,"3.2 stars. After reading The Man Who Mistook his Wife for a Hat, I was hungry for more of Oliver Sacks' stories. Liked this book in general. Unlike the other book I mentioned it has a theme ; vision and the loss (visual agnosia) or gain of it. It is really interesting to read about how someone's brain can affect this persons vision and the other way around. The power of the book is the detailed description of thoughts and vision. But because of the theme it got a bit boring in the end and some parts didn't add much. Overall I found the book interesting with some refreshing ideas and stories, but not that many as I expected. The stories I found interesting were especially the one about a writer who couldn't read (alexia sine agrafia), and so couldn't reread what he had written / find mistakes / know where he stopped last time so he can continue. This is also quite inspiring really, and a thread throughout the whole book; a lot of people find creative ways of living and compensations even though they can't see, have trouble recognizing faces/places (prosopagnosia), have only one eye and therefore can't see depth (monoscopy) or can't distinguish a tomato from a pear.Some quotes that I found interesting:--prosopagnosia (face-blindness)""Many prosopagnosics recognize people by voice, posture, or gait; and of course, context and expectation are paramount - one expects to see one's students at school""""I can see the eyes, nose, mouth quite clearly but they just don't add up""""At the club I saw someone strange staring at me and asked the steward who it was. You'll laugh at me. I'd been looking at myself in the mirror."" ""i see the lower halves of people in stereoscopic depth, while their upper halves are completely flat and two-dimensional.""""He felt that he had become far more sensitive to others' emotional states since losing his sight, for he was no longer taken in by visual appearances, which most people learn to camouflage.""""Born-blind people with normal hearing don't just hear sounds: they can hear objects""There are more but I won't include all of them :)"
14,033050889X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7106296-dilby,0,"Oliver Sacks lived one of the very best and fullest and most other-directed lives in human history, and he did so much to show us how irreducibly embodied each experience, each thought, each emotion, each memory, each person is. It is clear from every word that he wrote how each encounter with another person expanded his conception of human experience, and his commitment to honor the ever-increasing variety of being alive. He was an example of openness, curiosity, vulnerability and kindness whom I try to remember and emulate every day."
15,033050889X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,4,"In six fascinating vignettes, Oliver Sacks explores fascinating case histories of his patients. In most of these cases, the problems arise within the patients' brains. Several of the patients lose the ability to interpret what they see, although their eyesight is not the problem. They may lose the ability to recognize faces or to read, or to negotiate walking in public spaces. I thought the last chapter to be most interesting, about how most (but not all) sighted people form visual images in the minds, and how some blind people use visual imagery, also. One of the chapters explores Oliver Sacks' gradual loss of sight in his right eye. At one point, he was the only member of the ""stereoscopic society"" with monocular vision. While interesting, I found this chapter to drag too long--it should have been much shorter."
16,033050889X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22083484-barb,4,"Oliver Sacks passed away this week and it is a sad loss to those of us who have enjoyed his books as well as to his friends and family. The Mind's Eye, like several other of his popular books, relates stories of his patients with ingenious adaptations to unusual neurological impairments, such as the lack of depth perception, or face blindness (inability to recognize faces). The second half of the book tells his own story in minute detail, of the melanoma tumor discovered behind his eye in 2005 and his developing blindness in that eye. His intimate journal about the early symptoms, his coping mechanisms as well as his fears of loss show a man with deep curiosity about the world and the bravery to face his mortality yet continue to share his insights into the complexities of the brain."
17,033050889X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3843117-ensiform,4,"Another brilliant book by Oliver Sacks, this one on the eye and how vision, perception, thoughts, and identity are so strongly linked. As with his other books, in reading his accounts there is a sense of watching the scene of a gruesome car wreck: everyone is just a bump or a blood clot away from having their entire world irrevocably changed. In this case, by becoming blind, or losing the ability to read (but not, bizarrely, fascinatingly, to write), or losing color vision, or any other bizarre thing damage to the brain can lead to. This book not only has the usual case studies, medical history, musings on what makes us human, but also some memoir. Sacks reveals his own face and place blindness, a lifelong affliction that he has managed to compensate for but still crops up to bemuse and annoy him. In one particularly funny scene, he approaches a mirror, peers at his reflection, starts grooming his beard, only to see that the large bearded man in the mirror is not copying him, but is staring at him astonished: it isn't a mirror at all but another man behind a glass window!As ever, Sacks is a cornucopia of fascinating facts and optimistic sympathy as well as entertaining prose in the case studies. He details how a pianist and a crime writer overcome their alexia, somehow managing to play music and write books without the ability to read notes or words. Another case is about stereo vision, which leaves me still unsure whether I have that or not, and if it is as good as Sacks thinks it is (he enthuses about it a great deal). Unfortunately, Sacks' case isn't the face blindness, but a kind of eye cancer, which ends with him losing vision in his right eye. This part of the book, recorded with precision by the patient himself, is perhaps the most fascinating. It seems to show that deficiencies in the eye can lead to deficiencies in thought. When his right field of vision is gone, for example, Sacks acts and believes as though that entire space is gone. When a person steps into his right side, he panics: where did they go? Did they vanish? It somehow doesn't occur to him that of course he simply can't see them at the moment. ""Contrary to memory and common sense,"" as Sacks says, it is as if for him that space no longer exists. Taken a step further, this would suggest that what the eye sees, deficiencies or no, shapes how the mind thinks. This helps explain, Sacks notes, why some racial characteristics look very similar to those of other races, while within racial ""types,"" the differences are patently clear. The eye doesn't ""learn"" to appreciate the details that distinguish the types of faces that don't surround it from birth, because it doesn't need to. It does need to separate the faces among those it sees from birth, of course. So later in life, faces from other racial groups seem not to have as many variances in detail. A brilliant, sometimes scary, thought-provoking book."

If it had a name, it would probably be called something lame, like 'Choices'. In it, two or three options for a particular choice are available, and I have to justify to myself why I pick the option I do. It's like debating with myself, I gues, and it goes something like this:Palmerston North, Wanganui, or Hamilton? (Hamilton)Taller or thinner? (Taller)Live to 70 or live to 80? (80)Live to 80 or live to 90? (80)Smarter or prettier? (Prettier)Amputation or paralysis? (Amputation)Paralysis or head injury? (Depends on the severity)Oliver Sacks is a neurologist (if you don't know that already - he's up there with Dawkins in the recognisable scientists list, and I don't believe Richard Dawkins has ever been played by Robin Williams). This is Sack's 11th book, most of which are filled with case studies of his patients or correspondents, as he seeks to ""show us what is often concealed in health: the complex workings of the brain and its astounding ability to adapt and overcome disability"". 'The Mind's Eye', as the title suggests, is focused on brain damage - usually stroke - that leads to visual disorders.'The Mind's Eye' had me playing a different kind of Choices. Blind or Deaf? (Deaf). Lose your stereoscopic or peripheral vision? (Stereoscopic). Prosopagnosia (inability to recognise faces and/or places) or alexia (inability to read)? (Alexia. Just. Agonisingly.)It was the case studies of alexia that filled me with horror. I tried to imagine getting up one morning, flipping open the laptop, and not being able to read. Not just not able to piece together the letters of the alphabet, but not even recognising the alphabet. Having those 26 little shapes, so deeply engrained in my brain, appear as unfamiliar as Cyrillic script. Perhaps not only not being able to read, but suddenly, unable to write. Or worse yet, total - global - aphasia: the loss of the ability to process language in anyway, to make sense of words spoken to you, to speak, even, in some cases, to think. Sacks quotes the words of psychologist Scott Moss, who had a stroke at 43 and became aphasic:When I awoke next morning in the hospital, I was totally (globally) aphasic. I could understand vaguely what others said to me if it was spoken slowly and represented a very concrete form of action ... I had lost completely the ability to talk, to read and write. I even lost for the first two months the ability to use words internally, that is, in my thinking ... I had also lost the ability to dream. So, for a matter of eight to nine weeks, I lived in a total vacuum of self-produced concepts. ... I could deal only with the immediate present. ... The part of myself that was missing was [the] intellectual aspect - the sine qua non of my personality - those essential elements most important to being a unique individual. ... For a long period of time I looked upon myself as only half a man.'The Mind's Eye' is Sacks' most intimate book yet. Not only does he talk about bis own prosopagnosia (so severe he may not recognise his assistant and friend of 20 years when she's waiting in a cafe for him, or be able to distinguish his face in a window from the face of a man on the other side, or remember how to get to his own house if he deviates from his familar path: qualities that have lead to him being described as everything from pathologically shy to having Aspergers Syndrome). But he devotes a long chapter, 'Persistence of Vision', to excerpts from the journal he kept after a malignant tumour appeared next to his fovea behind his retina in his right eye. The tumour was treated first by inserting a radioactive plaque for several days; then with several lasering sessions; he nonetheless lost his stereoscopic vision (depth perception) and a large chunk of his central vision: after a bleed, his lost his peripheral vision.It seems a strange thing to say, but sight really matters to Sacks. From childhood (I thoroughly recommend his autobiography of his childhood, 'Uncle Tungsten', my favourite of his books). h has been obsessed with sight in all its manifestations, played out in photography and stereoscopy (he is a member of the New York Stereroscopic Society, a group that gets together to marvel over three-dimensional imaging). 'Persistence of Vision' tracks Sacks' experiences and feelings over several years, from sanguine to panicky to despairing. From the day he first noticed first a fluttering in his vision, and then a scotoma (blind spot), visits an opthamologist and is referred for a later appointment with a surgeon:Back at my apartment that evening, testing my right eye, I was startled to see that the horizontal bars on the air conditioner all seemed to be warped, converging and collapsing into one another, while the vertical bars diverged. I cannot remember how I spent the rest of the weekend. I was very restless, I went for long walks, and when I was inside, I paced to and fro. The nights were especially bad - I had to knock myself out with sleeping pills. Inevitably, self-pity seeps through: at Christmas he looks at the NYT list of people who died in 2005, and wonders if he will appear on the 2006 list. It's not really self-pity, though: it's part of the relentless self-examination he places himself under, tracking each change and quirk (his scotoma is the shape of Australia - “complete with a little bulge in the southeast corner — I thought of this as its Tasmania.”; he learns he can fill it in, with patterns from the carpet, the leaves of a tree, the blue of the sky).Sacks' case studies have fascinated me since I first read them in my third year at uni, when taking a neuropsychology paper. One of the reasons I dropped psych and stuck with art hsitory is the appalling damage psychologists and scientists have done, often inadvertently (but not always) as they seek to understand the human brain. You can't hurt anyone with art history, I reasoned. Sacks' humaneness though continues to shine though. Recommended, even if you just read the bits about himself. "
19,033050889X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26859189-nick,4,"Although I have the Dutch version of this book it still reads pleasantly. Only a few translation errors or one weird sentence but they are not that distracting.This is a great book which gives fascinating insights into the brain, its adaptability and human resilience to life changing events that are quite subtle but have huge implications. Such as not being able to recognize faces or recognize written language but still be able to write letters or text. It contains an array of fascination stories about the human brain and people.Only thing that distracts from the reading are the frequents references to his earlier books. It can get annoying because you're reading this book for a story and not for knowing in how many ways this book is connected to Sacks other books (in a way it may be his way of scientific writing style but this is my first book I read of him so can't say or judge this). It differs for references to other authors bookwork because in a way that expands the scope of the stories and giving the possibility to read some of the described stories in a more personal way. Despite this one main issue I had with the book, it was a great reading."

'""I librate between a glum and a frolic,"" as W.H.

Others, like John M. Hull, author of Touching the Rock: An Experience of Blindness, feel a distinctly subsumed ""deep blindness."" Hull developed more perception in his other senses, and more talents in his other modes of thought, in response to a gradual deterioration of sight that led to complete blindness at age 48.Another memoir of the loss of vision that I want to read before I lose mine is A Journey Round My Skull by Frigyes Karinthy.This is, so far, one of my favorite books by Sacks. I feel like I'm starting to get to know the man himself, and I might even read his more personal books (though I'm not usually into celebrity bios etc. and have been reading Sacks for the case histories).

22,033050889X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/77925-cat,4,"2011 Book 46/100I have read many (if not most) of Oliver Sacks' books about the medical mysteries of neurology. The Man Who Mistook His Wife For A Hat was one of my favorites, and this new endeavor ranks near that 1985 hit for me. I was relieved, because his last book, Musicophilia, bored me to tears - an unwelcome and totally unexpected reaction to one of my favorite science authors. With this book, which explores ""the stories of people who are able to navigate the world and communicate with others despite losing what many of us consider indispensable senses and abilities: the power of speech, the capacity to recognize faces, the sense of three-dimensional space, the ability to read, the sense of sight. For all of these people, the challenge is to adapt to a radically new way of being in the world"", as his website says, he returns to familiar territory, but adds his own story. It was surprising to have so many of the chapters reference his own experience of his own eye cancer and the bizarre and disconcerting effects of losing vision to one side - and then expounds on that experience in a whole chapter devoted to his plight. It was slightly disconcerting to have him suddenly be the 'mystery' that he is exploring in his book, though the journals that he kept from 2005-2009 certainly made that chapter one of the richest in detailing the day to day tribulations of vision loss and the ways that our brains compensate. One of my favorite stories was of how his own visual cortex began to “fill in” his blind spot with imagery borrowed from the parts of the scene he can see. The ever resilient brain, he remarks, “does not just fill in color, it fills in patterns too, and I enjoyed experimenting with my own scotoma, testing its powers and limitations.” A brick wall looks like a red blob from nearby, but as he pulls away, the grain and grid fill in perfectly where he otherwise has a blind spot. A complex patterned rug works best of all, filling in slowly from the sides and creating an illusion that he is seeing the whole rug. If you'd like to see what his writing is all about, here is a link to a New Yorker story that is taken from his work on this book. Enjoy!http://www.truncheon.net/newyorker/20..."
23,033050889X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66616-charlene,3,"Reading this book in my mid-50s, I realize that I'm bringing much of my own life experiences to it and re-acting to the stories instead of considering them from a more scientifc or detached perspective. The new ideas about the plasticity of the brain fascinate me. Case studies though are hard -- those are stories of real people, greatly affected by brain accidents or diseases. The second chapter, Recalled to Life, was about a woman with severe aphasia after a stroke which is what my own mother had for the last 6 1/2 years of her life. It was a difficult one for me to read. The chapters dealing with vision were fascinating and yet also very disturbing since losing my sight is my worst fear, I think, perhaps partially because I am terribly, terribly near sighted. I had to skim over the parts where Dr. Sacks was having his own vision problems. But at the same time I was fascinated by people's different brain reactions to ""not from birth"" blindness -- did their brain still provide visual images or did they go into mental darkness?  I believe that education & psychology classes should concentrate much more on the brain itself -- how does it learn, how does it change, how does it affect us? And maybe even religion classes should discuss this . . .  In my layman opinion, the best book on brain plasticity is The Brain That Changes Itself by Norman Doidge, published in 2008. And perhaps the most interesting of Sacks' books to me (not that I've read all of them) was the one just before this, Musicophilia."
24,033050889X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26188-jafar,3,"Oliver Sacks writes great books about people with rare and strange neurological disorders. He then uses these case studies to understand the inner workings of the human brain. This is well-known by now. What I didn’t know about Sacks is that he himself suffers from one such rare and strange neurological disorder: prosopagnosia. Prosopagnosia is the inability to recognize faces. Sacks can’t recognize anyone, not even close friends and associates with whom he has worked for many years - not even himself in the mirror. Maybe his own condition has been a factor in his compassion towards his patients and his desire to make sense of the human brain and how it affects our consciousness, emotions, and behavior.This book is mostly about vision, and how vision is really achieved in the brain, and how brain damage can result in very strange vision problems even though there is nothing wrong with the eyes. There’s a long chapter about the author’s struggle with eye cancer and how it resulted in his loss of 3D vision. The last chapter about the “vision” of the blind is most fascinating. We all do this, but we should stop pitying the blind. "

The case histories were fascinating and I discovered a few ways my brain has compensated for the loss of sight. I felt a sense of ""Oh, I do that"" as I read the experiences of others. I definitely came away with a greater sense of awe and gratitude to God for the marvel that our brains are and how I have in some ways benefited from this ""mind's eye"" phenomena.

He explored some of the issues related to how the mind processes visual imagery in his previous book Hallucinations, but this book deals entirely with vision. Topics such as colorblindness are explored, but I think my favorite chapter addressed stereo vision. It's one of those senses that we don't think much about until something takes it away, as Dr. Sacks learned personally when he abruptly lost all eyesight in one eye following an illness. Marvel fans take note: If you're curious about how a real-life Daredevil would be able to ""see"" without eyesight, you'll want to skip directly to chapter 7. Every brain experiences the lack of eyesight in a different way - vastly different, in some cases. Dr. Sacks was on the autism spectrum, so he's uniquely skilled to describe neurodivergence, with all the pluses and minuses of various neurological functions and the variations they come in.I borrowed this audiobook from the library using the Libby app. I was not obligated in any way to review it."

The Mind's Eye presents biographical tales of people who experienced a decline in different parts of their mind's eye (ability to recognise faces, things, text, space) or fully lost their sight. A case study after a case study, the book proves how flexible and adaptive the human brain (and spirit) is in finding ways to navigate the world and live a meaningful life in a new and often disorienting reality of facing a visual neurologic challenge. The glimpses of light in irreversible neurologic declines, as well as tales of possible recoveries, are filled with humour, wisdom, and empathy by the author."

I think for me, part of the charm of The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat was that the types of deficits it discussed were so broad ranging. Reading about problems with vision over and over again wasn't as engaging for me. The section I enjoyed the most was the discussion of stereoscopy.

One of my favorite acquisitions from the Quality Paperback Book Club (which is apparently still a thing, though I'm afraid I stopped being a member quite some time ago) is an omnibus edition of Sacks' Awakenings, A Leg to Stand On, The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat and Seeing Voices, all of which I found fascinating when I read them back in the 1990s. Sacks' much more recent collection The Mind's Eye engenders the same admiration now.The essays in this book are organized around one central theme, which could be expressed this way: we do not see the world, not really, not the way a camera records what's before it—what our minds do instead is construct an image of the world, an image which can be more, but is often much less, based on what our eyes record. It is, in fact, often a sheer 
confabulation
 (something which serendipitously ties this book in with my recent reading of Steven Galloway's novel The Confabulist).The Mind's Eye is a subject of great personal interest to Sacks as well. In 2005, his right eye developed a tumor which affected his vision severely—and Sacks' reaction to this was (in addition to the usual upset and search for solutions that any person would experience) one of fascination with the neurological aspects of his condition, a fascination that transmits itself directly to the reader.Not that it's always easy to read about the way Sacks' vision was affected—this passage, from the book I read just after The Mind's Eye (more serendipitous connections!), resonated exceptionally strongly with me after reading Sacks' account of his own surgery:""The body views eye surgery as such a severe violation,""{...}""a unique shock on every level. The eye is not designed to be cut into, like the skin; the central nervous system doesn't know what to make of it when someone goes poking around on the top floors.""—The Zero, by Jess Walter, p.265If the mysteries of stereoscopic vision have ever intrigued you (just how do those Magic Eye® pictures work, anyway?), or if you just want to know what an intelligent and articulate doctor does when his own optics betray him... perhaps you'll get as much out of The Mind's Eye as I did."
45,033050889X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5847899-patrick,3,"It's not as interesting as 'The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat', but I picked it up for a couple of quid in Fopp and it had some interesting bits and pieces.The heart of the appeal of Sacks' books is how what happens when the brain goes wrong can help to illuminate what is going on in the brain, full stop. The first and, on balance, best, of the stories is about an aging musician who found one day that she could no longer read. At first, she thought it was an eyesight problem, and in one sense, it kind of was, but only in the sense that sight is as much about what happens in the brain as in the eye. It turned out to be the beginnings of a progressive disease that slowly robbed her of the ability to perceive objects - so that eventually she was unable to do much at all, because she just couldn't make sense of what was in front of her. When I stop to think about it, it is kind of obvious that there must be some part of the brain which is responsible for making sense of the raw visual data provided by our eyes but it never really occurred to me that it could be wiped out so as to leave someone, in a sense, unable to see what they see. Sacks tentatively suggests that there might be some significance in the fact that it was her ability to read which went first - that perhaps reading is pushing the limits of some aspect of the brain's perceptual abilities and therein may lie some part of the explanation of dyslexia. It also helps to explain the otherwise baffling idea that people could be robbed of the ability to read while remaining able to *write*...The book goes on to discuss a couple of sight/perception-related disorders that I have myself. The lack of stereopsis caused in my case by being near blind in my left eye, and prosopagnosia, or 'face-blindness' (though having read Sacks' account of the condition, I wonder if I might more accurately be described as 'face short-sighted' or something). Of the two, the face-blindness chapter was rather more interesting (to me at least) if only because I recognised so much of what he was saying - films often not making sense because it takes too long to work out who is who (I wonder if this is in part why as a child I preferred books to television) and social occasions with unfamiliar people being something of a trial. Like him, I didn't even realise I lacked an ability that others had for years - though a friend pointed out that I used to grumble about people dying or cutting their hair, losing or gaining weight, or whatever, because it just made them hard to identify... The chapter about Sacks' loss of sight in one eye through cancer didn't interest me so much. Truth be told, I just don't think stereoscopic vision is such a terrible thing to lose. The brain is pretty good at doing depth perception from other cues - and I was a terrible tennis player even when I had two good eyes.The final chapter is about how those born blind (and, to a lesser extent, those who lose their sight later in life) 'see' the world, with the visual cortex of the brain repurposing itself to create a 'visual' world of sorts from the data it receives from the other sense organs. For all that we might think that this is not really 'sight', in a sense, all that is happening when we see is that the brain is creating a mental picture from what our senses tell it is happening around us.

47,033050889X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1050800-laurie,4,"I’ve been a fan of Dr. Sacks’ writing for many, many years, admiring his ability to explain in detail the workings- and malfunctions- of the brain without ever losing sight of the fact that said brain is a part of a human being. No one is every ‘the stroke in room 213’ to Sacks. In this book, the author takes on visual problems. The eyes are merely one part of what makes up vision. They are lenses that gather information to send to the brain. It’s the brain that makes sense of the images it gets, and it’s here that so much can go wrong. People who have perfect eyesight lose their ability to make sense of letters, and so can write but not read; people can see faces but not tell one from another; a musician can lose their ability to read music but still perform from memory or learn new music by ear. One can even lose their ability to tell what objects are when one sees them. Sometimes these afflictions are temporary; sometimes they are chronic; sometimes they are progressive. Knowing this, Sacks is understandably upset when he suddenly discovers a scotoma (a blank spot) in his vision. It turns out he has an ocular melanoma, a cancer of the eye. While ocular melanomas are rarely fatal like the skin type, they can still do a lot of damage. Sacks’ tumor was in a bad spot; radiation therapy, while it got rid of the tumor, actually made his vision worse. Suddenly, the author had no stereo vision and no vision on one side. Not only could he not see things on that side of his body due to problems in his eye, but he no longer thought about the possibility of things being on that side of his body because of how his brain reacted to this. People appearing out of his blind spot still startle him after several years of having this condition. He does not think to look in the blind spot area for an item he has lost sight of. This, despite his vast knowledge of the brain and how it works! This kind of book always makes one away of how scarily fragile the brain is, but some of his essays show how resilient it is, too. The people in these tales find ways of accommodating. Sometimes other senses come to stand in, as a person who loses their sight becomes more aware of sounds and touch. Sometimes their memory for images becomes stronger. Sometimes they learn a new way to communicate. The brain is plastic and can lay down new pathways, even in older people. "
48,033050889X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/763730-stewart,4,"	The case histories of Oliver Sacks, a professor of neurology and psychiatry at Columbia University, use the dysfunctions of the human brain to shed light on the normal functions of the brain that we take for granted. ""Awakenings"" and ""The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat"" fit into this category. His latest book, ""The Mind’s Eye,"" is another good example.	 One chapter in this book, “A Man of Letters,” was of special interest to me because I saw the original article in The New Yorker several months ago. The article fascinated me so much that I made copies of it and e-mailed them to family and friends. Mystery writer Howard Engel suddenly one morning in July 2001 discovered that he couldn’t read. He could see the letters and words in a newspaper or book, but he couldn’t make sense of them. He had suffered a stroke that had affected a limited part of his brain dealing with visual perception. Sacks relates the several years Engel sought to understand and fight his disability.	Sacks wrote, “We think of reading as a seamless and indivisible act, and as we read we attend to the meaning and perhaps the beauty of written language, unconscious of the many processes that make this possible. One has to encounter a condition such as Howard Engel’s to realize that reading is, in fact, dependent on a whole hierarchy or cascade of processes, which can break down at any point.”	Another particularly interesting chapter was “Stereo Sue,” about neurobiologist Sue Barry who suffered severely crossed eyes and who used one eye at a time to view the world. She was unable to see with binocular vision until, in 2002 in her late 40s, she got a special pair of glasses with a prism to align both eyes’ visual field. Suddenly the world changed. “When I was eating lunch,” she wrote in her diary, “I looked down at my fork over the bowl of rice and the fork was poised in the air in front of the bowl. I had never seen that before.” She described flowers as “intensely real, inflated,” whereas before they were “flat” and “deflated.”	Being able to read and see objects in depth are two of a host of abilities we take for granted. Sacks does us a favor by reminding us what an amazing thing the human brain is and how magical the “ordinary” world is."
49,033050889X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46497366-isabella-victoria,4,"The mind's eye is based upon various case studies of individuals who have different problems that are unique to them that doesn't let the grasp the world you could say. The writer even had his own background of this type of topic due to his cancer of the eye. What I liked about the book was that it gave so many different outlooks and perceptions of different people who face the same sort of situation and can relate to each other even though they face different obstacles. What I also liked about the book was that it was sort of primary information you could say because it came from a person who was facing the problem itself and that just makes the story more personal and general. What I also liked about the book was the clever book cover. What I didn't like about the book was that it sort of lingered on one sort of idea for too long that I believe was kind of unnecessary and just ready for the next set of chapter and new information. I am applying it in the way of facing obstacles on when you do encounter them you find new methods to cope with the loss of whatever it may be and look at it as the gaining that may be something sometimes greater within itself. Yes I would recommend this book to everyone because it is unlike something I have read before, it stands on its own as being different and unique and really get your mind working and thinking off of what you have read and what information you have obtained from the book. It is also a very genuine and personal book to the author himself so you could get the real insight on things and also see what other people face when dealing with this sort of situation."
50,033050889X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46580789-maria-fournier,4," To me this was one of the most enlightening books I’ve read over the past year . I absolutely love the compassion Oliver Sacks had for his patients and his ability to understand them so well. Through out the book I learned a lot about some interesting and kinda weird neurological disorders and how those suffering with these disorders were able to adjust to society. I was very impressed with how he even went into detail on his own personal disability, prosopagnosia(the inability to recognize faces) and how it affected him daily. I was also quite impressed with the fact that he was able to use the disorders his patients came to him with and convert them into case studies to better understand what machines can’t figure out about the human brain. His book was very well written and organized, making it easy to understand if you devoted yourself to it. Oliver also made it interesting to read his book by the way he presented his patients cases. He turned them into interesting little stories. His writing style made it easy for me to visualize the message he was trying to convey. That the mind will compensate for what it does not have or can’t comprehend. How the blind see, how the deaf hear, and how the mute speak. In a way I also learned a few things about myself thanks to his explanations for why our mind perceives things certain ways. It’s quite interesting honestly, the way that everything in his book was worded made you question yourself, your mind. If you aren’t disabled you could still put yourself in their shoes and feel what they felt. I would honestly recommend this book to people who are not easily bored or distracted because you have to fully wrap your mind around such a book to completely grasp the message trying to be brought across by the author. Either way, if you have a decent sense of humor might actually find the book quite enjoyable."
51,033050889X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3191832-lisa,4,"This book truely made me appreciate my brain and my eyes and their ability to work in tandem. HOWEVER, being a serious hypochondriac, this book also made me extreamly nervous about losing said ability due to a possible future stroke, eye cancer, or what-have-you (after reading The Family Who Couldn't Sleep, a book about prion diseases, i.e. mad cow, my relationship with meat, namely beef, has been permanently altered). Oliver Sacks writes in layman's terms and his case studies are all unique and interesting. The highlight of the book for me is the last bit, where Sacks gives us his journal and writes of his own experience dealing with eye cancer and stero-blindness (made all the more tragic by Sack's lifelong appreciation of stereoscopy, even mentioning that he is now the only monoscopic member of the New York Stereoscopy club). I myself am a great lover of stereoscopy and pride myself on my immediate ability to ""read"" stereoscopic images. Sacks passingly wonders if by pressing radioactive clock faces to his eyes as a child had something to do with his eye cancer (YES!!!!!), and I wish he would have explored this fleeting thought further. After losing much of his vision to cancer and its harsh treatment, Sacks makes the following observation: ""Greenwich Avenue, and the outside world generally, remain as full of hazards, real and imaginary, as when I went for that first post-hemorrhage walk many weeks ago. People rush around, so preoccupied with cell phones and text messaging that they themselves are functionally deaf and blind, oblivious to their environment..."" The world is unfair, it's clear, but the author's enthusiasim at where his work leads him at the end of his book is clear, and I think we can look forward to more from this author. "
52,033050889X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6188366-deb,4,"*Opening the mind's eye*In _The Mind's Eye_, Oliver Sacks explores the fascinating relationship between vision, recognition, and perception, and the amazing ways that the brain--and spirit--adapt to disorders of vision. The first part of the book does so through fascinating case studies (that give us a look into remarkable ways people respond to vision disorders like aphasia, agnosia, and prosopagnosia), the second through Sacks' personal experience with ocular melanoma, and the third part through neurological explanations and explorations of how changes in vision result in changes in the mind.This book has a little bit of something for everyone. If you're a fan of the engaging case stories found in _The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat_, you'll likely devour the first part of the book. If you want to learn more about Sacks specifically and how he heroically confronts his own personal vision tragedy, this part of the book will captivate you. And, if you want to better understand the neurobiological underpinnings of vision disorders, and how brain neuroplasiticity and human resilience support the adaption to vision loss, you'll probably find the final part of the book to be most satisfying.As other reviewers have noted, this book definitely differs from Sacks' previous books. Although it does have his trademark compelling case stories in the beginning, the successive narrative does at times get rather technical (and sometimes tedious) as he documents his own journey and delves into medical discussions of visual, perception, and recognition disorders. But, with an open mind, this book is nothing short of eye-opening!"
53,033050889X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47323871-sid-nuncius,5,"This is another excellent book from Oliver Sacks. The Mind's Eye is concerned mainly with vision - particularly the question of how our brains process the information from our eyes to form images, and the nature of remembered or imagined images. It is fascinating and illuminating and it has all Sacks's characteristic insight and brilliance combined with immense humanity and empathy with his subjects. It is, as always, quite beautifully written.Following the pattern of many of his other books, Sacks gives us case studies of patients with some malfunction of their visual perception in which he gives an exceptionally clear, vivid account of the problems and a brilliant analysis of what we can learn from them about the way in which we process and use visual information. All of them are very involving and extremely interesting, and the book closes with a very fine essay about visual perception. The longest, and to me most involving, ""case study"" (about a quarter of the book) consists of extracts from Sacks's own journal during the time he developed a melanoma on his right retina. He observes the visual effects with characteristic brilliance, but also talks openly about his human reaction to developing cancer, to his treatment and his experiences as a patient and ultimately to losing some of his vision. It is an exceptional piece of writing even by Sacks's own stellar standard, and a very touching personal account.This isn't a book to relax with after a rough day - it requires and deserves concentration - but it is gripping in its way and immensely rewarding. I thoroughly enjoyed it and recommend it very warmly."
54,033050889X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1711341-marfita,3,"Reading Dr. Sacks's books makes me hypochondriac. I now worry about my visual cortex - but I'm not as far around the bend as when I read The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat & Other Clinical Tales. Neurology is endlessly fascinating and Sacks makes it accessible. His work has given me insights into brain function that turn my previous notions upside-down. Before reading about Temple Grandin I would have insisted that people needed words to think. I'm pretty sure that I use words to think, and not pictures. Anyway, one interesting bit I came across in this books was (from page 59 - at least according to the e-book) that all natural writing systems ""seem to share certain topological features with the environment."" So, our methods of recording information stem from brain development used to make our way in that environment. That's either really exciting and profound or, like, Du-uh! Teaching shapes to children (triangles, squares, circles) is preparatory to learning to read. But, I wonder, what other possible features are there? And there I go, thinking out loud again ... in words. "
55,033050889X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/999171-anita,4,"I always love his books. This time he presents case studies on blindness: letter blindness, face blindness, stereo blindness, complete blindness. The people, he is so compassionate and interested that I can't call them cases, are fascinating. A concert pianist can suddenly no longer read music. A man can no longer recognize letters, but can still write: dyslexia on steroids. People who cannot recognize faces of anyone including loved ones. What happens when you only have one eye and can no longer perceive depth. The accommodations that help these people cope with their limitations are amazing. I always come away with an appreciation for the miracle that is our mind. This book is his most personal--he has face blindness and has lost the sight in one eye, so he is the only monocular member of the stereoscopic society (A group that celebrates 3D stereoscopic pictures--think view-masters). His books are always thought provoking, interesting, but sometimes very dense, and always worth the effort. His books have introduced me to Temple Grandin, the miraculous workings of the mind, and the triumph of the human spirit. I hope there are more to come."
56,033050889X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1291703-kathleen-hagen,0,"The Mind’s Eye, by Oliver Sacks, parts narrated by the author, and parts by another narrator, produced by Random House Audio, downloaded from audible.com.First, Oliver Sacks, now in his late 70’s, because of his own visual problems, introduces each character, but only narrates his own story, the experience of losing the sight in his right eye because of an inoperable tumor. We have six different stories here, including his own. One is of a person with face blindness, or prosapagnosia, a condition which many people have and many don’t know they have it. The disorder involves not usually being able to recognize people’s faces, in some cases not even your spouse. As it turns out Sacks has this disorder too and once walked up to a man and introduced himself, when it turned out he had just been talking to the man-his psychiatrist! After his discussion of his own loss of vision to have remaining sight in only one eye, he then produces a chapter on how various blind persons have coped with, compensated for, and used the visual part of their brain for other purposes. It’s a very interesting book, but it is sad to hear his own journal about losing sight. "
57,033050889X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4209176-allison,4,"I hesitated between three and four stars, but decided to give it four. I have read everything Oliver Sacks has ever written, and _Seeing Voices_ is one of my favorite books. However, I found this book less engaging than nearly all of his previous works. I enjoyed the new case studies, but I felt somehow that I had already read the same information in his previous books. The exception to this is his first-person narrative of his own experience with his changing sight, which was a somewhat jarring stylistic departure from the rest of the book, but very rich content-wise. I was very excited to see this book come out, but now that I've finished it, I miss books like _The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat_ and _The Anthropologist on Mars_. That said, though, for someone who, unlike me, hasn't spent the last five years reading every popular neuroscience/psychology book available, the case studies would probably be intriguing and unique. "
58,033050889X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/115473-siria,4,"This is a really interesting exploration of vision and cognitive function through the case study of six individuals—including a concert pianist who retains her sight, but loses her ability to read the score; a neurobiologist who acquires the ability to see in three dimensions, rather than two, comparatively late in life; a writer who finds a way of continuing his life's work though he can no longer read; and the author's own battle with cancer of the eye. Sacks' writing is clear and focused, but compassionate—he doesn't forget the patient even as he focuses on the illness. Yet, a little ironically, as I do not have a strong visual imagination myself, I found it very hard to take Sacks' written descriptions of how these people experience the world and to translate it into something I could picture and comprehend myself. Sacks' descriptions did move me to make the effort to see the world through other people's eyes, though—which I suppose is exactly what Sacks wanted. "
59,033050889X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3234545-judy,4,"I got this one for Christmas and started reading a few days later. Each chapter is the story of one patient who is coping with difficulties in vision either from a problem with the eye or with the brain.Oliver Sacks manages to write about scientific research and make it so accessible. Further, he writes about how the real people, who have these rare brain defects, manage to cope in their day to day lives.It's a fascinating read. There is one chapter written about vision problems that Sacks himself had to endure. He writes with thoroughness about what he copes with and how he feels about it. Yet, the scientist in him can also stand back and observe his own reactions and the very interesting effects caused by his brain. He's coping with a lot but his curiosity and enjoyment of life shine through.It's a book for those with at least some interest in psychology or neurology. The ""people"" part of the stories make it an inspirational book, as well. "
