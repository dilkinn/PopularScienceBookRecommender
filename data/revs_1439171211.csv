0,1439171211,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3583387-nebuchadnezzar,1,"Why am I sitting here reviewing another Sam Harris book? People keep telling me that I have to have to have to read them, and they seem to generally be what's called in military jargon ""target-rich environments.""Harris sets out to hunt two of his bugbears: Moral relativism and fundamentalist forms of religion, the former being equated with the political left and the latter with the right. These seem to be the only moral-political systems that exist in his world beside the one he goes on to promote. This, of course, leads Harris to ignore secular systems of thought on the right (usually aligned with right-libertarianism) such as those propounded by Ayn Rand or Friedrich A. von Hayek.Indeed, Harris blithely dismisses moral philosophy in a single footnote! Maybe if he hadn't done so, he would have realized that there is a distinction between descriptive relativism and normative relativism, the former meaning simply that there are no objective moral ""facts"" (as there are in the sense of scientific facts). The latter position argues from the former that we ought to have no universal standard of morality. Moral skeptics such as J.L. Mackie and James R. Flynn argue in favor of descriptive but not normative relativism. Harris conflates the two and thus turns moral relativism into some kind of blanket apologia for female genital mutilation and other such horrors. (Also, as Russell Blackford noted in his review, Harris commits even further equivocation in blowing off Mackie in a footnote: http://jetpress.org/v21/blackford3.htm)Harris engages in some rhetorical flailing against David Hume's is-ought distinction, attempting to replace it with a Benthamite hedonic calculus which is to be computed using brain scanning technology. Call it neuro-utilitarianism, I guess. In a truly odd argument, he goes on to use his own neuroscience experiments on religious belief to break down the fact-value distinction, saying that beliefs and facts are equivalent because they are processed in the same fashion in the brain. Well, I use my eyes and visual cortex to process both the sight of a hamburger and the Grand Canyon. That doesn't mean I can eat a national landmark or go whitewater rafting through a beef product.All of this handwaving is claimed to be a solution to the is-ought problem, one of if not the biggest problem in moral philosophy. However, Harris backpedals in a few places as if his argument had failed, noting that science can never determine what we ultimately ought to do. No argument there, but this makes his thinking come off as even more muddled and inconsistent. I'm not aware of any serious arguments that science can never inform morals and ethics. Formulated in this way: ""If you want x, then do y,"" science can inform us about or determine the y, but cannot determine the x. Hume himself also never claimed a total separation of facts and values -- he argued that a logical justification must be made before the ""ought"" can be derived from the ""is."" There is nothing new or controversial there, but it stands in contrast to the rest of the book in which Harris continuously promises a capital-S Science of Morality. Whatever it is, it definitely isn't science. The rest of the book doesn't fare well either. The reader is left wallowing in Harris' sophistry for page after page as he tries to work out of the corner he's painted himself in. Some parts verge on the downright scary as well, such as ""lie-free zones"" that would be made by essentially using fMRI as lie detection technology. (Neuro-fascism?) Harris also wastes some pages pushing a form of naive determinism again, free will and determinism being a topic which he seems to have even less of a handle on than moral and ethical philosophy.Islam pops up as a handy bogeyman again, and he favorably references the conspiratorial Bat Ye'Or, a cranky pseudo-scholar whose book Eurabia: The Euro-Arab Axis has re-gained currency recently with the more rabidly Islamophobic set. (At least there are no cites to parapsychologists this time, at least none that I could find.) Harris also continues his feud with Scott Atran, claiming him to be another ""moral relativist"" (apparently this is code for ""someone I, Sam Harris, disagree with"") and totally misrepresenting his arguments. Atran's ""review"" of the book (http://nationalinterest.org/bookrevie...), if it can be called that, is really a continuation of this line argumentation, though it is a priceless evisceration of Harris' ignorance of anthropological and psychological research on religion.The picture that Harris paints is a gross misrepresentation of moral philosophy and current politics, not to mention the fact that the book is more or less the extension of the naturalistic fallacy to a few hundred pages. Like his previous work, this is filled with smug dismissals of actual scholarship in the fields he's attempting to write in and play-acting at ""revolutionary"" ideas. The only positive I can find here is that it may introduce readers to some more lucid thinkers and scientists doing original research on morality and psychology, such as António R. Damásio, Jonathan Haidt, and Joshua Greene. Otherwise, chalk another one up for the annals of scientism and neo-atheism."

Although I've always enjoyed Christopher Hitchens, I've thought others of the New Atheists a bit shrill. I just assumed Sam Harris was going to be more hammer and less scalpel. I was wrong. I really enjoyed this book. While there is little doubt what Sam Harris feels about religion, his method here is more an attempt to 'cut a third path' through the wilderness between those educated liberals who think there is no universal foundation for human values AND the claim that a universal morality requires the support of faith-based religion. Obviously, being able to criticize religion plays a part of this effort, but Sam Harris (in this book at least) seems more interested in pushing people to think that a scientific approach to morality is at least an important step. I agree. The idea that science has an important thing to say about values and morals is fundamental.Not done. But done enough."
2,1439171211,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2412448-daniel-toker,5,"Harris's ideology is incomplete - he admits this much himself. But this book provides the groundwork for a (slightly) new way of conceiving of ""morality."" The general idea is not new, but his thesis is unique in that it identifies psychology and neuroscience as the tools by which to determine how our actions affect conscious beings. And I think that Harris is thinking in the right direction; though we can derive no moral absolutes, we can identify the ""morality"" of actions on a spectrum or ""landscape"" of happiness/well-being - some actions clearly lead to greater total happiness and well-being than others. And the extent to which actions lead to happiness/well-being is something that psychology and neuroscience can indeed help evaluate. Much work remains to be done in the realms of neuroscience and philosophy to complete the project Harris has put forth. But I think it is a worthy project, as his is the best conception of ""morality"" I have seen yet. "
3,1439171211,http://goodreads.com/user/show/502680-david,2,"	As I read The Moral Landscape I wondered if Sam Harris would be good to have as a neighbor. He is a strong believer in objective morality. Many Christians believe that atheists are all terrible people with no morals. Sam Harris shows that this stereotype is false (though he would go a step further and say it is most Christians who have poor morals). As a moral guy who cares about issues in the world, Sam Harris would be a good neighbor.	The problem is, I am a Christian. For that reason, I fear Sam Harris would not like me. I would hope that if we got together with our wives to play Settlers of Catan, or perhaps watched a football game (does Penn State every play UCLA?) we could get along. Could we disagree and still live in neighborly friendliness? I have read all three of Sam Harris' books and I am not confident that they would as he shows a deep and bitter anger towards Christians. Not that I blame him for this, the hate mail he has received from people of faith has not done much to bring any sort of reconciliation.	In The Moral Landscape, Harris presents a strong argument for objective morality. He opposes secular scientists and philosophers who argue that there are objective facts in science but when it comes to morality, objectivity is gone. Harris sees this moral relativism as false. Worse, he sees in it secularists conceding objective morality to people of faith. His goal is to provide an argument for morality from a secular perspective.	Harris defines ""good"" as that which supports human well-being. Determining human well-being rests mostly on the science of the brain, which Harris admits is still relatively new. Thus his book is not a final argument for a specific morality. Science is not at a place to do that yet. Instead it is an argument that science does speak to issues of morality and over time will do so more and more.	As a Christian I tried to come to this book as open-minded as possible. In other words, I expected to disagree (much as an atheist expects to disagree when coming to a Christian text, we're none of us unbiased). But I tried to give Harris a fair hearing. I am sure there were some specific arguments I did not fully grasp, for I am not a trained scientist. I suspect many of those arguments were in the chapter on belief (chapter three), which I found to be the most interesting and insightful chapter in the book. Overall, I still am a Christian and I still find arguments for morality from a naturalistic perspective wanting.	Harris' argument seems to be a form of utilitarianism - maximizing the good (well-being) and minimizing the bad. It is difficult to see how this can be measured, which I believe has been the main critique of utilitarianism over the years. Besides that, if Harris is right that well-being is the key, the question is whose well being? Why should I care about the well-being of others if it does not affect my own well-being? He reports an exchange he had with a scientist at a conference who said she has no issue with the Taliban's violence against women because that is just the way their culture is. Harris was appalled at this. But if I am happy, if my wife and kids are healthy and my life is comfortable, why should I care about these people on the other side of the world? Perhaps Harris cares, and good for him. But if I am an atheist, I only have this one life to live and then I am gone forever. The Taliban is thousands of miles away and I do not want to bother with it. I would rather enjoy my life. 	The same basic question came up a few times as I read. He seems to lament the fact that more people spend their time playing video games than working to help the homeless (p. 70). Again, if such people were lucky enough (or worked hard enough) to have a comfortable life, why not play video games? Who is Harris or any of us to tell them they should live in a different way? Of course, Harris' whole project is to prove that science does provide such ""shoulds"". I just don't see it.	Likewise, he shares a story of his wife being hit on at the gym (p. 51). He was glad she resisted the flirting of this other man and he speaks of how an affair would damage the well-being of his family. I am glad for Harris that his wife is loyal. But if she had chosen to cheat on him...what if that increased her own and this other man's well-being? What if this man was a widower with four children? Perhaps stealing Harris' wife would hurt Harris' daughter, but it could help these other four children? Isn't that more human well-being?	My point is that judging morality in these ways is unsatisfying. Further, if all that matters is human well-being, why not envision a scenario from a movie like The Matrix where all humans are plugged into a computer? If such an existence would make us happiest, why not? Or as one reviewer says: ""Nobel Prize–winner Daniel Kahneman studies what gives Americans pleasure—watching TV, talking to friends, having sex—and what makes them unhappy—commuting, working, looking after their children."" (http://nationalinterest.org/bookrevie... )	Harris also rejects free will, while assuring us that this does not lead to determinism or fatalism. (103-105). Reading his argument for this, I felt like I was reading John Calvin (and Harris may be surprised to find that Calvin would agree with him in this assessment, though for different reasons). Harris says we believe in free will because we are ignorant of the causes of our actions in each moment (105). He goes on to say:	""But the fact that our choices depend on prior causes does not mean that they do not matter. If I had not decided to write this book, it wouldn't have written itself. My choice to write it was unquestionably the primary cause of its coming into being. Decisions, intentions, efforts, goals, willpower, etc., are all causal states of the brain, leading to specific behaviors, and behaviors lead to outcomes in the world. Human choice, therefore, is as important as fanciers of free will believe"" (105)	""There is a distinction between voluntary and involuntary actions, but it does nothing to support the common idea of free will...the former are associated with felt intentions (desires, goals, expectations, etc.) while the latter are not...a voluntary action is accompanied by the felt intention to carry it out, while an involuntary action isn't. Where our intentions themselves come from, however, and what determines their character in every instant, remains perfectly mysterious in subjective terms...the freedom to do what one intends, and not to do otherwise, is no less valuable than it ever was"" (105-106). 	If there is no free will, then however the intentions, goals and such that arise in us, we are not responsible for them. So how are we responsible for the actions they lead to in the world? He goes on to say, ""What we condemn in another person is the intention to do harm"" (108). Why condemn something that this person has not freely chosen? Why hold them responsible? It seems more consistent to say that we don't have free will and thus we are subject to whatever combination of natural desires made us who we are.	Harris did make a huge point that Christians should listen to (123-124). Here Harris talks of how the internet has reduced intellectual isolation but it has also allowed bad ideas to flourish. He goes on to say that the less competent a person is in a given domain, the more he will overestimate his abilities, in other words ignorant people are more confident (123). He applies this to debates between science and religion:	""When a scientist speaks with appropriate circumspection about controversies in his field, or about the limits of his own understanding, his opponent will often make wildly unjustified assertions about just which religious doctrines can be inserted into the space provided. Thus, one often finds people with no scientific training speaking with apparent certainty about the theological implications of quantum mechanics, cosmology, or molecular biology"" (124)	I have to say, I agree with Harris here. Christians do no one any good when assuming that just because they are Christians, they are right about everything. For example, Christians should have no problem admitting that Richard Dawkins (or Sam Harris) knows more about science than they do (unless said Christian has degrees in science). 	But to turn this critique around on Harris, he often writes as if he possesses a better knowledge of Christian faith than Christians do. He declares the Bible is in favor of slavery, quoting chapter and verse. This sort of surface-level understanding of the text seems to be the same surface-level understanding he decries when Christians approach science. Why not engage with the best Bible scholars? Or at the very least, try to get inside the culture in which the Bible was written to try to understand if there is more going on. 	Would it matter to Harris that though the Bible allows slavery, it puts regulations on this slavery that put the slave in a much higher position than slaves in the surrounding culture? Probably not, as the idea of progressive revelation does not seem to carry much weight for Harris. Harris, like some other atheists, seem to say if God exists then God would do this (says who?). At any rate, if he wants to be as fair to Christians as he expects people to be to scientists, he should recognize that proof-texting is not valid biblical interpretation.	The same critique could be applied to history. Harris rolls out the rhetoric that Christians in the middle-ages burned witches on a regular basis. But Rodney Stark has shown that witches were rarely burned in the middle-ages, instead witch-burning became most popular at the same time as modern science was beginning to rise (see For the Glory of God: How Monotheism Led to Reformations, Science, With-Hunts and the End of Slavery).	This book has me wanting to read more about brain science, especially books that limit the tangents. Harris seems to be writing for an audience that he knows will agree with him, so he throws out rhetoric and red herrings every now and then, to remind us how dumb religion is. I am not sure what the point of the chapter on religion was (chapter four) other than just to smack around religion for a while. In this I am sure Harris comes across as a hero to those who agree. To me, it sounds like the same sort of arrogance that Harris hates when ignorant Christians discount the findings of science. 	While I would like to read more about how the brain works, and I assume science will continue to shed light on this, I do not think it is possible to find morality (or meaning, which is a separate question) here. Jerry Coyne in his book Why Evolution is True talks about how when a lion takes over a pride he will kill the baby lions to rid himself of the competition. Of course, no person would say that lion was a murderer or was evil. Yet when I listen to the History of Rome podcast and learn of how many emperors upon coming into power would kill their relatives or relatives of the previous emperor to solidify their power, I see this as murder. What makes humans different? If we are just animals, or if such murder increases the well-being of the emperor and his empire, why is it wrong?	I still agree with Ivan Karamazov in the amazing novel, The Brothers Karamazov: ""if there is no God, then all things are permissible"". If Harris is wrong and there is no objective morality from a secular view, it does not automatically mean there is a God. Perhaps life just is meaningless. That is what Ivan believed, and it angered him as this philosophy justified his father's disgusting life. I think Ivan is right. If there is no God then what reason can you really give a person to choose to help the poor rather than spend their days playing video games?Online Reviewshttp://bnreview.barnesandnoble.com/t5...http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/03/boo...http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001..."
4,1439171211,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9779623-shaun,5,"Oh my, where to start...Okay, so I guess it would be helpful to disclose that I am a long-time fan of Sam Harris. Not only do I agree with most of his ideas, but I find him to be both an articulate and entertaining writer, always a plus. The Moral Landscape is no exception.The motivation for this book seems to be the commonly held belief that religion, if it does nothing else, serves as the source for our morality. It is one of the most common arguments Harris encounters in his campaign for reason, which often finds itself pitted against religious institutions and their belief systems.According to Harris, religion has long been credited with providing humankind a morale code, a precept that many atheists are unwilling to challenge. For, in some cases, even the greatest champions of science, rationality, and logic seem to feel that science has little to offer once we start talking morality and ethics.Harris, however, argues that this is just not the case. Science, he claims, already has lots to say about morality and, with the continued progress in the neurosciences, will only have more to say in the coming years. He further points out that what science has to offer is infinitely better than the world's many religions for a multitude of reasons. I tend to agree and here's why...For one, it is clear that as a rule and generally speaking there is a trend toward treating people better and more humanely in part because--through science--we have expanded our understanding of ourselves and the dynamics that exist in the societies that form the basis of our existence. This is not to say we don't have a long way to go...simply that we have made progress in the right direction. One needs only to look back into our not too distant past to see the barbaric behaviors that were once commonplace and considered justifiable. So though many nostalgic grandmas and grandpas may not agree, over the years, we clearly have raised the moral bar on many levels. Secondly, religion(s) (especially today's most popular religions) are not the source of our morality and never have been, otherwise we would still judge certain instances of rape, pillaging, infantcide, human sacrifice, and genocide to be completely moral. Again, it is our evolving understanding of ourselves and our environment that shape our ideas about what is and what isn't moral in the various religious texts and not vice versa. Furthermore, asserting that religion establishes morality is self-limiting in the sense that only one religion can be the true authority.Just because we don't currently have all the answers to all the complex moral questions that face us...doesn't mean that the answers don't exist. It also doesn't mean that all the answers are equally valid and worthy of our respect. In many cases, science offers a process by which various answers can be systematically evaluated. As our level of understanding continues to grow, so will our moral sense continue to expand.Finally, if you accept that our beliefs and our actions are the complex result of our physiology, genetics, and past experiences then it would seem logical to believe that science will ultimately have lots to say about those beliefs and actions as well as their consequences for both the individual and for society. Such information can and will serve as a foundation for making moral decisions, and/or decisions that maximize the greatest good for the greatest number of people.In the end, I think Harris'main point is that the understanding of ourselves, our world, and our universe provides the foundation for our moral reasoning and as such, science not only has, but also will continue to contribute to our understanding of the moral landscape.Harris gives concrete examples of the many ways in which science has already helped to shape and mold our contemporary moral code.For example, consider the following:A man kills his girlfriend.A man kills his girlfriend after finding her in bed with her lover.A man kills his girlfriend. Later, doctors find a tumor in an area of his brain that is associated with impulse control. A man who was severely abused by his mother as a child kills his girlfriend.We view each case differently with respect to morality in part because we have a better understanding of the brain and behavior than we did two-hundred years ago.But this represents a small fraction of what is discussed in the book, and I really can't even begin to do it justice, so I won't try. As always, Harris is a champion of reason and doesn't sugar coat his contempt for any dogmatic institution that discourages critical thinking, including religion. He also stresses the innate dangers of treating all ideas as being equally valid and deserving of our tolerance and respect, especially when it comes to morality. He also tries to bridge the gap between philosophy, which must take into consideration what we don't know, and science, that which is focused on our current knowns...though continually expanding its borders.Bottom line, if you've ever contemplated the complex issues that face us all, not simply as individuals but as a society, and ultimately as human beings, then this book is worth reading if only for the points being raised and ideas being explored. Furthermore, if like me, you believe that religion isn't the basis for morality, than this book will help you to explore that idea in greater depths. Harris most definitely writes to the average person (a plus in my mind), which often garners him criticism within certain circles, but for all the wrong reasons...and thank goodness that he does."
5,1439171211,http://goodreads.com/user/show/732522-dylan,2,"I thought I would have few problems with this book. There’s little to no reason where I’d be annoyed by a book where I agree with the fundamental, underlying principles of the work. I fully believe that it’s possible to scientifically determine moral values. And look! It’s a book about scientifically determining moral values. We should get along famously.Except that’s not what ended up happening.Instead I found myself getting progressively more and more annoyed by the general tone of the entire book. I found myself arguing against what Sam Harris was saying, even when I agreed with him. He has such an insufferable, condescending way of putting things that I didn’t want to agree with him. And if that’s how I reacted, I can’t imagine how much he’d put off people who already disagreed with him. He hasn’t really mastered the persuasive part of the persuasive essay.Then there’s the fact that by the end, he had strayed so far from the point that I had completely lost interest in what he was talking about. It had devolved into an attack on attempts to reconcile rational scientific thought with religious beliefs and faith. Which wasn’t really the point of the book or, at least, I didn’t think that was the point. I picked up the book so I could learn “how science can determine human values”, not look at a vomited up pile of Sam Harris’s bile.While I appreciate that he seems to consider himself the lone voice of reason in an increasingly insane world, the man needs to actually talk to people and not rant at them in a thinly veiled attack on his critics."
6,1439171211,http://goodreads.com/user/show/235151-richard,4,"Given that nearly everyone who reads this book will disagree vehemently with its conclusions, and given that the subject matter is almost entirely theoretical, Moral Landscape needed to have been more thoroughly researched and more scholarly in its presentation in order to achieve Harris' goals. I'd originally given the book five stars because, in my opinion, Harris' central points are intriguing and probably correct, but on further reflection I've had to scale my enthusiasm back.Those who disagree with Moral Landscape's conclusion – that reason can guide us to objectively true or false answers to questions of ethics – will almost certainly do so for one (or both) of two reasons:● They argue (per Hume) that an ought can't be derived from an is. Reason may tell us how to achieve our aims after we've decided what they are, but it's incapable of guiding us to those aims in the first place. Morality is therefore intrinsically subjective.● They believe that morality by definition originates with God. Since God establishes the absolute, universal standard, morality is fundamentally objective, but the standard can be obtained only through revelation, never by reason.The problem with the idea of morality deriving from God is that a thing is good either because God has decreed it so, or God has decreed it so because that thing is good. In the former case we would be living under a cosmic dictatorship, whereas in the latter we would find that God, in deferring to a definition of good that exists externally to divine judgment, would be superfluous. As is usually the case with theistic dogma, there's neither objective evidence nor sound logic to support the claim that ethics depends upon God, but if believers choose to regard it as axiomatic, there's also no way to refute it, so that's pretty much that.(Theologians sometimes try to get around that dilemma by arguing that God's nature is somehow ineluctably woven together with goodness. But if good is defined merely as concordance with God's will then it's tautologically trivial for God to be good. If good is defined in terms of happiness and suffering then good can have no intrinsic meaning for an omnipotent, perfect, eternal and solitary being; it can only be meaningful with respect to the interactions of minds capable of harming one another.)The is/ought problem is the more interesting of the two objections. Harris does acknowledge that ethics must be built on postulates that are by definition unprovable, and in this sense, it's true that morality can never be absolutely objective. He argues however, that the same could be said of any such system: there's no reason to consider ethics to be uniquely indeterminate. Physics, for instance, is grounded upon unprovable values. We can't actually prove that acquiring knowledge through reason and evidence is better than obtaining it from authority and revelation; to be a rational skeptic is to accept that axiomatically, and to implicitly reaffirm it at every step in our conversations. Even if one chooses to argue (for example) that reason and evidence are superior because they provide tangible and consistent results, we still must believe, axiomatically and without proof, that tangible and consistent results are things of value. And yet, the necessity for reason to lift itself by its own bootstraps in this way, does not prevent us from asserting that physical laws are objectively true.In other words, the book's major insight (and a point that I think its critics tend to overlook), is that the foundations of ethics are no more arbitrary than the foundations of any other field of understanding. If the physical sciences can be built upon a foundation of unprovable values, why can't there be a science of ethics that does so as well? Even if we accept that an ought can't be derived from an is, what should prevent us from defining our oughts to be is's, i.e., to place our oughts among the axiomatic is's of our moral philosophy? Moral Landscape, in my opinion, stands or falls on whether or not it can convince the reader of this idea. Landscape's second interesting point is that the least arbitrary way to establish our oughts is to base them on the ""well-being of conscious creatures."" Harris argues that anything that is of interest, is interesting precisely because of its effect upon some entity's conscious state. Whatever it is that anyone values, the value of the thing is ultimately grounded in the emotional, subjective mental state of at least one consciousness. If there were any particular thing that could not, under any possible circumstances, ever have an effect upon any conscious creature, then that thing would have no value whatsoever. In a universe completely devoid of any consciousness, the concepts of good and evil could have no meaning. (If a tree falls in a forest and no one is there anywhere to hear it, does it make a sound difference?) (As an aside, Harris argues that there must be a natural hierarchy of importance among conscious creatures, that is, that a mind with the capacity to experience greater ranges of thought and feeling must be considered to be more valuable than a lesser mind. Thus, chimpanzees are more important than mice, human beings are more important than chimpanzees, and in theory, there could be superior intelligences [extraterrestrial or artificial, perhaps] that would be more valuable than humans. If the hierarchy continues indefinitely then wouldn't that open the door to the possibility that there could be an infinite consciousness that might be ethically more important than the combined collective [yet still finite] consciousnesses of every other living being in the entire universe? There could also be multiple infinite consciousnesses; if so, would the moral value of infinite consciousnesses be ranked by their cardinalities? On the other hand, is it possible that there's some threshold of awareness or cognitive ability beyond which all conscious creatures could be considered to be of equal importance?) Having demonstrated (as the reader may or may not accept) that it should be possible in principle to create a hard science of objective ethics, Harris makes little effort to raise or respond to potential objections to his ideas, nor to suggest ways in which we might go about discovering that new ethics, beyond expressing his (to be fair, well-founded) confidence that neuroscience will play a major roll. Those hoping for greater depth will be disappointed, and may wonder if there's anything more useful here than a theoretical refutation of moral relativism (a philosophy which is already easily dismissed for being self-refuting)."
7,1439171211,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5237420-ana,5,"This is my first Sam Harris book, and I'm glad I finally started reading him. I have been familiar with his public appearances, debates and ideas for some time now, but I had not yet found the books of his that I was interested in. Most of the public work that I was aware of was his fight against religion, along side Dawkins, Dennett, Hitchens and so on. Even though he is one of the New Scientists, I've always felt something is special about him, because he seems to consistently be the youngest (and by that I mean almost 50) in all of the debates he has, which tells (me) a lot about his capabilities as an intellectual powerhouse. This work is his attempt to define what he calls a ""moral landscape"", a view of the highs and lows existent in human morality, to answer the question of why morals are important and how they find a place in diverse scientific fields, especially from his own point of view: neuroscience. I have read some of his research before, and especially his work on belief and how it correlates with brain function, and it is fascinating. I truly recommend him as an author, his research to anyone interested in the scienc-y parts, and this book (as I am sure, the others I'll read from him), because we never have the right to say we know enough about an opinion, even if it is one that we hold to be true in our hearts. "
8,1439171211,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,5,"This book starts out rather slow, with a heavy dose of philosophy. It does pick up after the first couple of chapters, as the book shows how the mind treats facts and values in a similar manner. The author shows that the goal of morality should be to maximize the ""well-being"" of as many individuals as possible, in the present life (not the after-life, which is not verified by objective evidence). While it is not always obvious what constitutes ""well-being"" (it can be a very gray area), it is clear that mutilation, slavery, murder, and the like are not conducive to well-being. The book clearly demonstrates why science has just as important things to say about morality as religion--and in certain respects, science is more justified. The author shows that science and religion are truly contradictory in many respects. In fact, though many ""scientists"" try to use scientific arguments to relieve the contradictions, their predisposal toward religion displays an inherent bias. As a result, they are not using the scientific method--they are simply arguing from emotion and faith, rather than reason."
9,1439171211,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,1,"I've had a good go at reading this without any knee-jerk reactions, but generally I find Harris' views instinctively abhorrent -- despite his championing of reason and science, I don't think he avoids knee-jerk reactions more than anyone else. Particularly when it comes to religion.The basis thesis that there are optimal states of well-being for humans, I accept. That science will be able to improve our understanding of that, I don't doubt. That Sam Harris could be the person that executes this moral calculus? That, I can't countenance. It's partly an instinctive dislike -- I haven't enjoyed any of his lectures and talks that I've watched either -- and partly his intolerance of anything he doesn't understand.I mean, he claims to be talking about universal states of well-being, and states that there may be multiple 'peaks' on the 'moral landscape' where the greatest possible well-being can be achieved. In almost the same breath, he dismisses any thought system he can't understand, particularly if it involves religion.Perhaps the fact that I'm a Unitarian Universalist makes this so difficult to swallow. I believe that there are many different paths to follow, whether you're looking for an afterlife, Enlightenment, reincarnation... There are different ways to be good, and it's hard to measure that. For example, we would accept a person who works with abused children in Britain, who kept their good as their first priority, as a good person. We would also accept a person who teaches children who are living in poverty in another country as good. Which is better? Which more worthy? I'm not sure I'm being very coherent about this. I'm sure there's someone waiting to jump on me telling me that Harris is completely coherent, entirely reasonable, etc; most likely some of them will have some sexist comments to make, without being aware of their own hypocrisy. For me, though, I didn't find Harris' argument that coherent. He seemed to argue himself round and round a tiny point without ever looking up to see the wider world and put his work in context -- every statement seemed to be a reiteration of his core thesis, rather than something which expanded it."
10,1439171211,http://goodreads.com/user/show/110433-socraticgadfly,1,"Presumably the last Sam Harris book I will ever readWhat's wrong? Harris is a Platonic idealist in drag. He also engages in scientism. And, his Islamophobia seems to largely come straight from the neoconservative playbook.Read on for the details!Sam Harris tries to draw a hard-and-fast dichotomy between science-based morals and ethics and religious-based morals and ethics in this book.However, this is the real world, not a Platonic idea (Harris comes off as quasi-Platonic in more than one way in parts of this book), and so, it's not totally amenable to Harris' bifurcation.Take abortion. Many religious people support at least some right to abortion, but noted atheist Nat Hentoff is 100 percent prolife. Ditto on end of life issues. And, if I looked a little bit, I could surely find atheists and agnostics with less enlightened views on gay rights than many religious people.Now, as to the science part ... the idea that we can have a science-based morality? Harris offers little in the way of actual neuroscience studies on the brain processing moral issues. We may well get oodles more such studies in the future, but that's not today. Harris also doesn't address the issues of what MRIs measure, how well this correlates with thought output, etc.Likewise, he discusses little in the field of well-done evolutionary psychology (to distinguish it from Pop Evolutionary Psychology).Beyond that, he simply ignores that the study of the human mind, whether from the POV of cognitive neuroscience or evolutionary psychology, is at best in the Early Bronze Age and is arguably, at least on the matter of morality and ethics, still in the Neolithic.So, while science may at some point (far?) in the future offer us significant oversight on specific moral issues, it doesn't today because it can't. And, per the specific moral issues I listed above, it may never be able to.Indeed, with reference to that, Harris' approach to science and morality smacks of a fair degree of scientism. And, I write this as an irreligious, skeptical naturalist.That said, there's several other problems with this book.I'm going to address several overview issues first, before making any page-by-page critique of the book.First is the matter of Harris' Islamophobia. Since Islam is in general cited regularly for examples of immoral behavior and beliefs, we need to examine this.First of all, it seems much of Harris' Islamophobia comes from the neoconservative political playbook. He favorably references an off-the-wall neocon writer, Bat Ye'Or, whose book on Islam's alleged takeover of Europe was one-starred by me.Secondly, he's confusing a static historic snapshot of history with a moving picture. If we went by snapshots, 900 years ago, Christian Crusaders would have been the poster boys for immoral behavior. 750 years ago it would have been pagan/animist Mongols. 600 years ago, polytheistic Aztecs.Finally, if we confine ourselves to today, the Hindu Tamil Tigers of Sri Lanka killed 30,000 in their civil war, far more than al-Qaeda has killed.Second, whence comes Harris' moral stance, ultimately? I believe he is not just a moral objectivist, albeit a consequentialist (a stance more often associated with moral relativism but compatible with objectivism too), but a moral absolutist -- specifically a Platonic Idealist moral absolutist. There's irony there in spades, since the early and middle Platonic dialogues were devoted to Socrates, deconstruction of other people's definitions of moral issues such as justice. (Of course, Socrates usually doesn't offer his own idealist definition back; such things arise only in later dialogues.)Third, what of Harris' claims to be examining morality and its foundations from a scientific perspective?First of all, he's not the first to do so. He didn't invent sociobiology or evolutionary psychology. (Let me be clear here -- much of what passes for science in alleged evolutionary psychology is actuallly the pseudoscience of Pop Evolutionary Psychology. However, unlike a P.Z. Myers, there is legitimate work being done in this field, albeit little and far between.) So, Harris isn't new in his effort and he's certainly not new in his hope.That said, for someone who wants to be scientific, he seems often lacking. (No shock here; I saw the same problem way back in ""The End of Faith."" First, from an evolutionary standpoint, Harris doesn't address issues of individual vs. group selection. Now, I'm not as bullish on group selection as, say, David Sloan Wilson, but I do think it deserves more consideration than many evolutionary biologists give it. Second, Harris doesn't devote any scientific examination to cultural evolution. Admittedly, there's not a lot to really nail down ant this intersection of biology and sociology, but Harris doesn't even get into what is out there.Beyond what I mention above, for someone with a graduate degree in neuroscience, he spends about ZERO time referencing actual neurological study of the brain. No V.S. Ramachandran here, folks! Not even close.Fourth, Harris and philosophy, not just the ""is-ought"" issue, but certainly including that.First of all, for people who have read previous works of his, and not embraced him as a bundle of light, his arrogance in dealing with the philosophical background should be of no surprise. But, it still needs quoting.Page 197, footnote 1: ""Many of my critics fault me for not engaging with the academic literature on moral philosophy. ... First ... I did not arrive at my position ... by reading the work of moral philosophers; I came to it by considering the logical implications of our making continual progress in the sciences of the mind. Second, I am convinced that every appearance of (academic terminology) directly increases the amount of boredom in the universe. ... (T)he professional philosophers I've consulted seem to understand and support what I'm doing""Let's unpack what's wrong with this quote.1. Harris might actually have learned something by engaging with other moral philosophers either of today or the past. That would include wrestling more with Hume's is-ought; that would certainly include a provocative AND nontechnical book like Walter Kaufmann's ""Beyond Guilt and Justice.""2. Is Harris saying he's either too dumb or too lazy to ""translate"" language of academia to a general audience? Or a too-arrogant mix of both? One of the best classical philosophers on moral issues was Hume, precisely because he wrote in a way for the general public (of a certain educational level) to understand.3. Neuroscience is a ""hard"" science with plenty of its own technical language. That doesn't stop Harris from wanting to focus on advances in scientific discovery, albeit while, rather than discussing them in a nontechnical level, not discussing them at all. I smell a HUGE steaming pile of hypocrisy here.4. In light of what I noted above about Socratic dialogues, Harris never discusses what happens when two big moral issues, like ""fairness"" and ""compassion,"" collide. This is one of the brilliancies of Kaufmann's book mentioned above.In light of all that, let's look at Hume's famous is-ought issues.Hume discusses the problem in book III, part I, section I of his A Treatise of Human Nature http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Treati... (1739):>>In every system of morality, which I have hitherto met with, I have always remark'd, that the author proceeds for some time in the ordinary ways of reasoning, and establishes the being of a God, or makes observations concerning human affairs; when all of a sudden I am surpriz'd to find, that instead of the usual copulations of propositions, is, and is not, I meet with no proposition that is not connected with an ought, or an ought not. This change is imperceptible; but is however, of the last consequence. For as this ought, or ought not, expresses some new relation or affirmation, 'tis necessary that it shou'd be observ'd and explain'd; and at the same time that a reason should be given; for what seems altogether inconceivable, how this new relation can be a deduction from others, which are entirely different from it.<<Hume calls for caution against such inferences in the absence of any explanation of how the ought-statements follow from the is-statements. But how exactly can an ""ought"" be derived from an ""is""? The question, prompted by Hume's small paragraph, has become one of the central questions of ethical theory, and Hume is usually assigned the position that such a derivation is impossible. This complete severing of ""is"" from ""ought"" has been given the graphic designation of Hume's Guillotine.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Is%E2%80...Several issues here:1. ""Ought"" is multivalent. Sometimes, most notably in ethics, it has an explicitly moral tone. Other times, far from that. For instance, in late 19th-century physics, scientists said the ether, the luminiferous ether, ""ought"" to weigh a certain amount, even though experiment rebelled against that.2. In the case of ethics, to worry about ""is-ought"" is to approach the issue the wrong way. Rather, staying within Hume, one can ask what ethics can be naturalistically devised and supported. In this case (contra what Harris seems to say) we turn to evolutionary psychology **properly done** (and not Pop Ev Psych), as well as evolutionary biology of non-hominids. We can, through cultural anthropology, partially reinforce hominid ev psych findings. That then said, we would note that often, there is not one ""right"" ethical answer to some issues of ethics. We also should note, per someone like Walter Kaufmann, sometimes there is no right answer at all, or that a ""right"" answer may be culturally determined, or that a ""right"" answer for an individual may be the ""wrong"" answer for society. In this last case, no science gives us ""the answer"" as to whether individual needs or societal needs should prevail. And, for that matter, different religions may give us different answers, or the same religion may give us different answers at different times, as they do on other issues such as collective guilt.That said, this is a serious book. If you want a great modern philosophic study of ethics, read the book I mentioned above - Walter Kaufmann's ""Without Guilt and Justice."""
11,1439171211,http://goodreads.com/user/show/262254-greg,5,"I thought that this book was a brilliant follow up to End of Faith. I've always thought that End of Faith was somewhat of a misnamed book and that with a slightly different focus could have been truly masterful. What I really appreciated about that book was the nuanced exploration of the nature of belief, belief formation, and the role belief plays in behavior and how all of this relates to and affects our states of consciousness. This book was a continuation of that theme in the moral sphere. And for the most part it was fantastic. I thought Harris made a strong case for accepting the strong role science can and should play in moral considerations. I thought his chapter on belief and his section on free will were brilliant. And I was even impressed with his discussion and acknowledgement of many of the problems and difficulties that come with utilitarianism. I found his chapter on religion somewhat pointless though and think the book would have been better simply leaving it out. Especially because his chapter on religion didn't even focus on what I considered might be the obvious and more relevant way to discuss religion. Maybe he's just written so much on religion that he didn't want to rehash the same arguments, but then it just felt like he felt he needed to throw a bit of religion bashing in there, and anything would do. On the whole though I found it marvelous. But rather than continue talking down that path, I thought I'd paste a recent blog post I made discussing some issues I find with Harris' argument. It's because I so strongly agree with the majority of his writings, that rather than focus on everything that was good, it'd actually be more valuable to the conversation to point out where I think he hasn't been careful enough or possibly wrong. These aren't insurmountable obstacles (at least I hope not), but rather holes waiting to be filled. -------------------------------------Sam Harris is one of most vocal writers around today promoting the strong relationship between scientific knowledge and morality. Not only does Harris believe that scientific knowledge can inform moral decisions, but he asserts that science can determine moral values. He’s not the only figure making these claims, but he’s definitely the most prolific. And with an undergraduate degree in philosophy and a PhD in neuroscience, he’s certainly well situated to make and defend these sorts of claims.This is a pretty controversial claim to make though, and Harris is often attacked both by religious figures AND scientists. Ever since David Hume put words to the notion that you can’t derive values from facts, that you can’t derive what “ought” to be from what “is”, philosophers and scientists have behaved with this idea as a presupposition in all their dealings. Science describes facts about the world, science cannot tell you what is important or how to live your life. Some of the biggest names in moral research have concluded that all science can do is describe and explain the moral behavior of human beings, but is overstepping its bounds when it attempts to prescribe what to do, or to determine values.Harris argues that this is-ought distinction is fundamentally mistaken, and I actually agree strongly with him in that. And while I agree with a vast majority of Sam Harris’s arguments, they are not problem free, and they are themselves based on some assumptions that need to be made explicit if we’re to make an informed decision about the quality of his overall argument.Harris’s basic premise is this: If ethics is about anything, it is about the conscious states of organisms able to experience consciousness. Any other definition is meaningless. Any action that has no actual or potential affect on the conscious state of an organism is by definition valueless. I think we can accept this claim as long as we are responsible about thinking about the broader affects that stem from our actions. If my action isn’t immoral to me, or you, or anyone else in the world, or anyone that may ever come along, if it causes no pain or suffering to any creature able to experience those states of consciousness, if there is no one around to care one way or the other, then what could possibly be immoral about anything?Harris’s next point is a simple small jump. If ethics is about the conscious states of organisms, then this must by definition translate into facts about brains and their interaction with the world. This also seems uncontroversial. Assuming conscious states have a neurophysiological correlate (an extremely grounded assumption), then it’s obvious that science can give us a complete account of the ever evolving dynamic states of consciousness, the very thing that ethics is about. It’s worth pointing out that when Harris uses the word “science”, he is not talking about double blind research carried out in labs by people wearing white lab coats. Harris is defining science in the broadest way imaginable, as a process with respect for the scientific method, incorporating reason and logic and proper justification for beliefs (I sometimes think his definition of science is just ""philosophy"", a label and pursuit he tries to keep himself separate from). Agree or disagree with his definition, just keep it in mind when evaluating his assertions, since many who disagree with him tend to ignore his encompassing view of science.But this can’t be it right? Ethics isn’t simply about conscious states; it’s about a certain type of conscious state. And here is where we start running into some conceptual problems, which to some degree I hate myself for having. Sam Harris’s next point is that ethics must specifically be about maximizing the well being of conscious organisms. On the one hand, this also seems uncontroversial. Moral concerns about the well being of other people very obviously translate into facts about how our thoughts and behaviors affect these people. Science can thus describe the result of this endeavor, and based on our goal of maximizing well being, determine what it is we ought to do.Did you see the problem? Science can determine moral values if we accept three assumptions.1) Ethics is about the conscious states of organisms. (okay)2) Conscious states of organisms are within the realm of science. (okay)3) Ethics is about maximizing the well being of conscious organisms. (hmmmm)I think you’ll see why I dislike even having to question this last assumption, since generally I agree with it. But is this statement itself something that can be determined by science or not? And if it is, can science determine the specific nuances that go into it? Sam Harris, true to form, again defines “well being” in the broadest way possible. He does not mean simply physical health. And also doesn’t simply mean “happiness”. Sam Harris is using a definition of well being that itself is, or would have to be, the result of a very nuanced philosophical argument through this process of scientific exploration. This would involve taking into account the motivation for being kind and caring towards others, understanding the affect it would have on their mental states, on your mental states, and on the mental states of others. This is not a simple one to one relationship. This is a convoluted story that needs to incorporate the affect behavior may have on broader social, political, and economic systems, and how those systems themselves affect other people, and the resulting mental states of those people due to those changes.How to balance various issues like civil liberties, individual privacy, free speech, and the importance of keeping citizens safe to maximize well being, surely has an answer, even if the complexities of it lay forever out of our reach. Harris is quick to point this out often. Harris isn’t arguing that science has all the answers, but that science can conceivably determine all the answers with enough information and enough time. But even accepting this we find ourselves in a dilemma, because this pursuit depends on a definition of well being that is itself part of the pursuit, and how those factors discussed weigh in a well being scale. How we define well being, how our conscious states change for the better is not solely dependent on biology, on genetics, it is also dependent in a very strong way on our values and beliefs (some of which are there for evolutionary reasons, yes). And as human beings who are prone to error, we know we can wrong about values and beliefs. If you’re neighbor believes they are the reincarnation of Jesus, we’re likely to assume they’re wrong. Someone might value money above all else, someone else might value respect for authority above all else, and someone else might value open mindedness above all else. Whether we can objectively determine which of these values should be preferred over others and by how much isn’t necessarily the point. The point is that as it stands, people currently value those things in different ways, and their conscious states will change differently based on the presence or absence of those things.If somehow science determines that free speech should be weighed above the safety of the citizenry as a means to maximize well being, but the majority of the population values safety over freedom, their conscious states will not be maximized, because of the nature of their neurophysiology and psychology. Is the right thing to then disregard the scientific data? Or implement it regardless? What if science determines that the wearing of Hijabs by women in the Islamic faith is in fact a practice not conducive to maximizing well being, what do we do? A woman who has grown up in this culture and with this belief and value system believes this is the right way to live. Do you force her to take it off? Wouldn’t that objectively lower her well being since her entire psychology is geared towards reacting negatively to that? What if we found out that by immediately murdering half of the current population of the planet, 3 billion people, countless trillions and trillions of our descendents would be able to live lives where their well being was maximized? If we don’t commit this act of mass genocide, only 25% of those trillions of descendents will have their well being maximized.How can we go about answering these questions through the process of science and empiricism? One problem is inherent in Harris’s espousement of utilitarianism (morality lies in the consequences of an action). Where is the point of evaluation of a utilitarian argument? Is it how the action will affect the recipient immediately? Is it how the action will affect everyone alive on the planet through the vast web of interconnectedness that the nature of cause and affect necessitates? What time frame do we judge by? Immediately? One year? 100 years? A million? Imagine I criticize you in some way that has the immediate affect of lowering your state of well being. But then after two weeks and some reflection you realize it was actually a good thing and it has helped you out and it raises your level of well being. But then a year from now it turns out this criticism and the changes it has made in you have actually drastically lowered your well being. How do we evaluate something like this? And how do we evaluate all the people you affected during that time with the mental states that I helped create? Further, how do we compare various forms of well being and suffering against each other? How do ten headaches compare against one broken bone? Ten jailed innocents vs. the hunger of 1000 children? I’m skeptical whether these are questions a utilitarianist approach is capable of addressing due it's sole focus on outcomes. No matter how much consideration for outcomes a person takes into account, a decision can only be made in the now, with insufficient information. And well being is a temporal process, as is consciousness, and neither exist as snapshots in time.Even had Sam Harris chose a different moral theory, we can argue that whichever theory is chosen relates to his other points about science in the same way. My argument is that whichever theory we choose will have the same problems for his argument. Science has to determine the rightness of the theory itself. A theory is only as good as the facts it's based on, and so this topic strays into what philosophers call epistemology, or theory of knowledge. How do we know anything about the world, and what warrant and justification do we have for believing things. Part of this process involves determining what is right and good to value, and providing justification for the very goal of morality. I don’t think this is impossible. In fact, using Harris’s broad conception of science I’ll even grant we can provide good reasons for being able to do this, since this endeavor of defining what is worth valuing will itself undergo a process that must respect the scientific method and rationality. What we value, how we act, and towards what ethical goal we are progressing is all intertwined, and arguably should not be separated in pursuit of morality. The problem is that Sam Harris doesn’t focus on this, and it leaves what I find to be otherwise impressively strong arguments with a hole waiting to be filled.my blog: Cognitive Philosophy"
12,1439171211,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10445368-kevin-kelsey,5,"Terrific. The main concept is that although moral questions are often very difficult to answer, and there are usually many satisfactory answers to each one, we can use the principles of science to eliminate the obviously bad answers to those questions."
13,1439171211,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3692137-xing-chen,4,"Agreed wholeheartedly with practically everything in the book, except for a couple of things:1.Harris repeatedly laments the frequency with which he encounters well-educated, scientifically-minded, secular moral relativists, who defend the practice of repugnant rituals, such as genital mutilation. I imagine that the reason behind their inability to see eye to eye is not due to a fundamental disagreement on morality and the existence of a range of states of being that, for all practical intents and purposes, have positive and negative poles, but rather to the failure to establish a clear consensus on underlying assumptions when discussing theoretical situations. For example, he posed the question to an acquaintance, ‘What if we found a culture that ritually blinded every third child by literally plucking out his or her eyes at birth, would you then agree that we had found a culture that was needlessly diminishing human well-being?’To which she replied, ‘It would depend on why they were doing it.’Harris did not respond favourably to this person’s reply. I hardly doubt that if the issue were discussed further, the two of them would be able to find common ground. Maybe the scenario flashing through her mind was that of a technologically-advanced civilization, capable of replacing ordinary human eyes with superior bionic ones. Surgical methods, performed under anaesthesia, with all the modern equipment at hand, often involve procedures that can still be crudely described as ‘plucking’ something out. The issue that sometimes trips up conversations between thoughtful people is that one is often inclined to play the devil’s advocate, to make contrarian pronouncements and to throw open the gates of the imagination in an understandable attempt to advertise one’s creativity and open-mindedness. We naturally tend to bask in our hyper-awareness of the fact that our individual understanding is limited, and thus there exist states of which we know little, and which render us leery of passing snap judgments. And the problem, I always find, with these ‘hypothetical scenario’-type gedankens (whether or not they’ve to do with morality), is that they’re often cloyingly predicated on limited, restrictive assumptions, and are so impoverished in detail that one struggles to find hooks upon which to hang substantial arguments. (Searle’s annoyingly pointless and irrational ‘Chinese Room’ and the ‘Throw a person onto train tracks to save many lives’ “quandary” are examples that pop insufferably to mind. Or heinously formulated essay questions along the lines of, ‘Money cannot buy happiness. Discuss.’) Their queries are phrased in such an over-simplistic, self-consciously provocative way- bleating to be construed in exactly the flavour that the poser of the question intended it, despite their lack of detailed qualification- that one cannot help but tease slightly when giving a response. We let loose with non-committal, politically saccharine replies, burnished with the sarcasm of “Let’s see whether our questioner really believes that I’m as small-minded and absurd as that.”There must be some prevalent but oft-overlooked, rarely-discussed difference in the way individuals mull over such questions- or in the way the particular context of a discussion is able to elicit a variety of reactions. Some people respond strongly and decisively with clear-cut opinions, using commonly-cited arguments that rely on immediate acceptance of certain underlying assumptions, whereas others have a tendency to exploit their contrary streak. Empathy, playfulness, argumentativeness, and scope of the imagination are contributing factors. If there’s a wealth of literature out there on ‘What gives rise to a contrarian mindset?’, I need to get acquainted with it.2.'Meaning, values, morality, and the good life must relate to facts about the well-being of conscious creatures- and, in our case, must lawfully depend upon events in the world and upon states of the human brain.'I find this an unnecessarily narrow definition- imagine that you are responsible for setting public policy that relates, for example, to nuclear proliferation. You are faced with a decision that potentially leads to one of two outcomes: all human beings are wiped off the face of the planet, as well as all life as we know it, so that only 'inert' materials such as rocks remain; or: all life is destroyed, AND the earth is obliterated, so that not even rocks remain. In either case, humans become extinct, and life as we know it vanishes. But I would argue that there still exists a moral obligation to choose the second option, which accommodates the preservation of the non-living components of our planet. Life and consciousness, and therefore meaning and morality, emerge from non-living, unconscious matter; as such, our considerations of what constitutes morality should take non-sentient beings into account. Perhaps this is so broad a definition that it is pointless for all reasonably conceivable intents and purposes. If so, I back off.Favourite quotes:'...morality should be considered an undeveloped branch of science.''...not knowing what is right- or that anything can ever be truly right- often leads secular liberals to surrender their intellectual standards and political freedoms with both hands.''Meaning, values, morality, and the good life must relate to facts about the well-being of conscious creatures- and, in our case, must lawfully depend upon events in the world and upon states of the human brain.''...the division between facts and values is intellectually unsustainable. especially from the perspective of neuroscience.''We have recently emerged- some of us leaping, some shuffling, others crawling- out of many dark centuries of religious bewilderment and persecution, into an age when mainstream science is still occasionally treated with overt hostility by the general public and even by governments.

So while knowledge is open-source, ignorance is, too. It is also true that the less competent a person is in a given domain, the more he will tend to overestimate his abilities. This often produces an ugly marriage of confidence and ignorance that is very difficult to correct for.

14,1439171211,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3844551-mike,2,"Sam Harris starts off his book stating that he has the modest mission to convince the reader that neither divine command theory nor positivistic emotivist theory is a sufficient account of morality. But then he goes somewhat further: His actual mission, as he lays it out, is to show how maximizing human wellbeing--defined as a subjective neurological state of wellbeing--can form the basis for moral reasoning, and that scientific inquiry into neurology and effects of different acts can form the basis for such a moral system. The scope of his argument is therefore rather limited; however, his writing betrays a lack of the education and clear, analytical thought that would be necessary to make a broadly persuasive or powerful argument.Pinning down exactly what Harris is arguing in any bigger context is difficult. He is frankly hostile to religion; therefore it seems he is looking for an account of morality that is based on some combination of naturalism and pure reason. He is not at all clear about the distinctions between morality, ethics (he identifies morality and ethics), politics or public policy, and jurisprudence or legal philosophy. It seems that at different times in the book, he addresses all of these issues, without making clear when he's dealing with which. Given that these are usually considered different areas of academic inquiry, and there is a large literature about their similarities, differences, and overlaps, this presents in itself a significant flaw in his book.A second flaw that makes analyzing Harris difficult is that he is not clear about what ""wellbeing"" is. On the one hand, he is honest about this; he frequently uses the analogy to health. He points out that health is a poorly-defined concept that nevertheless can be discerned. However, where his analogy becomes a problem is that he does not seem clear about whose wellbeing is being discerned. Is it the wellbeing of the moral actor, or the aggregate greatest wellbeing for the greatest number? He seems to vacillate on this point. At times, he seems at pains to show why helping others is pleasurable to the individual moral actor, and at times he sounds almost like a utilitarian. Either way, he seems to slip in between the two paradigms without signaling or justifying his moves.He senses his first task is to deal with the problem of question-begging. Both David Hume and G.E. Moore identified a problem in consequentialist moral philosophy: If, as Harris says, the objective of his system is to maximize human wellbeing, then it isn't really a system of moral philosophy. It's a system of wellbeing philosophy, not moral philosophy, because there is as yet an irreducible leap between any state of affairs and the good. In other words, just because something leads to wellbeing, has no bearing on whether it is good; and there is no guarantee, either in principle or practice, that any particular instance of wellbeing is actually ""good,"" unless you simply fiat that wellbeing is good and close your mind to further inquiry. Harris rightly senses that this is a devastating objection that he cannot answer head-on. Hume, Moore, Kant, and others all found more or less convincing ways around this question-begging, but Harris doesn't even try. Instead, he simply says: You don't really believe that. You can identify a better or worse life. And he uses some examples to show that in fact we can identify ""good"" or ""bad"" lives and that in many cases, good or evil acts are more or less intuitively clear. And his argument is fairly convincing, even if it is basically special pleading. But this is a insurmountable problem for Harris that I will return to later in my review.Closely related to his confusion about whose wellbeing he is talking about, Harris seems to have difficulty taking individuality seriously. This shows up in two ways. First, he assumes that everyone wants wellbeing. Either this is meaningless, or it is an unclear statement. If it simply means that even if you do something that objectively harms your wellbeing, you clearly meant to do it in order to increase your wellbeing, then it is a tautology and adds nothing to the discussion. On the other hand, if there is some objective way of measuring wellbeing, then we can at least start making some moves toward thinking about what wellbeing really is and how to get there. But he never really closes that gap. More profoundly, Harris has no answer to the issue of the oppressed minority. Imagine if 80% of the population would have their average wellbeing level go from 75 to 85 if some act were done--with sufficient attenuation to make it not tantamount to slavery, etc.--that would cause the other 20% to have their average wellbeing level go from 75 to 55. Clearly, the aggregate wellbeing of the society has increased; and clearly some individuals are very badly hurt. Harris attempts to deal with this problem three times, and fails every time. First, he simply denies it, when he mentions Rawls' statement of the issue; then he says that the subjective wellbeing of the 80% would be harmed because their neurological state would be harmed; then he says that it just doesn't work that way. But of course all he has to do is look at his native United Kingdom (or my native United States) to see a society where a real-world scenario similar to this has happened over the last decade, and it seems no one is much bothered by it.It barely deserves mention that Harris's overt hostility toward and determination to misrepresent religion whenever possible mars his arguments. He is a New Atheist, which is to say he's regurgitating some Hume and Voltaire as if he thought of it himself. That will tell the reader of this review all you need to know.I am also ignoring the philosophy of science issues that using scientific inquiry to get at morals raises. Suffice to say they appear huge on first glance, but I'm not smart enough to suss them out fully.Very closely related to the Hume issue is the Brave New World issue. Ultimately, because he has no philosophically adequate account of what the word ""good"" means, he cannot explain why World Controller Mustafa Mond was not correct that he had created the best of all possible worlds, or why the Savage might have had a point. He also, of course, cannot deal with the problem of the suicidal person, except to say (and to his credit Harris is honest about this) that he is wrong about his own wellbeing, unless he takes of course the Vatican-ish position that a life in being, no matter how unpleasant, is always per se infinitely more valuable than a life not in being, which I doubt he would do.In short, what Harris has done is written an excellent apologia for a particular variety of early-21st-century vision of human wellbeing. He has not written a book of ethics. It is helpful, interesting, and probably is grounds for public policy research and a reasonably good guide to personal action a lot of the time. But it isn't a book about morality."
15,1439171211,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2118517-michael,1,"Ironically, Harris's latest can best be described as a sermon that will appeal only to the choir. Its angry tirades will only convince those who haven't already committed themselves to every jot and tittle of his world view that Harris has spent his entire conscious life seeking to justify his own visceral hatred anything and anybody religious--without realizing that his efforts to do so have only led him to invent his own peculiar religion. (I think calling Harris's uncompromising ""New Atheism"" a religion is consistent with Harris's own understanding of the concept of religion: in his last book, ""End of Faith""--which lays all evil at the feet of a phenomenon he labels ""religion""--Harris felt comfortable calling even communism a religion. It might, however, be argued that ""religion"" is simply Harris's term of choice for any system of thought that differs even an iota from his own.)The subtitle of the book promises much more than Harris delivers. First, Harris's belief system rests on the proposition that the measure of all actions is whether they conduce to something Harris calls the ""wellbeing of conscious creatures"". Harris never acknowledges that this axiom is unproven (and unprovable) by any scientific method. Second, even Harris acknowledges that science hasn't--and may never--provide us with definitive answers about human happiness. The point Harris is really trying to make is that nonbelievers should embrace the same moral absolutism that has traditionally been the province of those who believe in gods or the supernatural. Though he doesn't say so explicitly, it seems that the reason this is important to him is that it can justify his desire to wage war upon the religious.One example of the single-mindedness of Harris's attack: As an example of a society that he supposes everyone will agree does not function properly, he discusses at some length the culture of the Dobu, residents of an island now part of Papua-New Guinea. Examination of the books extensive notes and bibliography reveals that in forming his opinion Harris has failed to examine any of the ethnographical literature on this group--a subject not free from controversy. Instead, Harris has apparently relied on a quotation and discussion found in a collection of essays dealing principally with neuroscience.Thus, Harris's book is best read as a cautionary tale about the power of the non-conscious part of our minds to subvert and control the conscious. Indeed, since the evolution of those parts of the mind preceded the conscious, it is unsurprising that the conscious is generally their servant and not their master."
16,1439171211,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9512361-andrew-langridge,2,"Although Sam Harris would deny that philosophy prior to the age of science has anything worthwhile to teach us, The Moral Landscape falls squarely within two long traditions of philosophy that could be said to include Aristotle; namely utilitarianism and naturalism. I find it admirable that Harris dispenses with philosophical jargon in making his book accessible to the general reader, but I also find it rather disingenuous to pay no regard to these traditions.Harris’ utilitarianism starts from the premise that there may not be one perfect way to organize society, but there are clearly better and worse ways of doing it, and he envisages an ethical continuum (or ‘landscape’ of peaks and troughs) in which we are able to rank our moral beliefs in terms of their positive or negative impacts on human well-being. So our values are always expressible in terms of our well-being as conscious individuals and reducible, in principle, to facts about our brains and our environment. Thus, Harris’ naturalism reveals itself as a demystifying worldview in which all human values and ethical positions are explainable in terms of scientific concepts. If defining and objectifying them in this way is not always possible in practice, owing to the complexity of human society, then Harris thinks it is bound to be possible in the future with developments in neuroscience.There are some aspects of this book about which I am not going to take issue, such as the centrality of consciousness in morality and the difficulty in separating facts about our lives from our moral values. I also agree that religious prescription is superfluous in moral discourse and often damaging, although I would not want to dispense with concepts such as ‘authority’ and ‘power’ altogether when analyzing the origin of moral terms such as ‘ought’. The key question is whether what we care about in life is actually measurable; whether moral terms are really susceptible to objectification, as Harris believes. I agree that moral relativism is wrong as a metaphysical position, but the relativistic aspect of moral argument is not so easily swept under the carpet. Moral reasoning always seems to involve an open-ended ‘stepping back’ process. Hence, it is impossible to simply state “murder is wrong”, since murder is typically permitted in the case of a ‘just war’; which in turn forces a consideration of the meaning of ‘just’. Most of us would agree with Harris that the moral beliefs of the Taliban are condemnable, and yet every member of the Taliban must surely be worthy of respect as a human being, whatever his or her beliefs. It is very easy for moral approbation to become a pretext for imperialism and domination of those deemed somehow less than human. The very notion of ‘human rights’ is capable of being used as a weapon for the strong to control the weak. This moral complexity is clear on an individual level, and even on a political level moral assessments are never unproblematic, as evidenced by the fact that the USA initially supported the Taliban on grounds of their opposition to Iran.As I see it, there are two major problems at the heart of Harris’ arguments. Firstly there is a lack of appreciation for the limitations inherent in the scientific method and, secondly, there is a lack of acknowledgment of the role that historical contingency plays in social and political analysis. I think that these two problems are related, but let me start with science. There are, of course, some basic empirical facts impinging on any analysis of the human condition such as our requirement for food, drink and shelter. These isolated facts are not very interesting from an ethical point of view, and they gain their significance from the context or hypothetical structure in which they appear. In physical science we rely on abstract rationalization to reduce any natural phenomenon to a few definable and repeatable variables; so for example, Newton's second law says that the gravitational force acting on a falling body is proportional to its mass, but is independent of the size, material and shape of the body. By contrast, in any moral or political analysis, the historical and social context in which decisions are made is always relevant and so abstraction is not effective. We must endeavor to leave out as few variables as possible and try to synthesize all the available information. I disagree with Harris that adding this layer of complexity leads to a moral relativism in which we are impotent to judge. It simply means that owing to the ‘accidental’ contingencies of history, there are an excess of possible reasons and reason is never sufficient to make judgments. We rely on something besides our rational faculties when putting ourselves in the position of another individual; a difficult empathy that is generally understood to be what morality consists in (“love thy neighbor as thyself”). The closer our proximity in space and time to the subject, the easier it is for us to pass judgment. Thus, we are much more comfortable judging the practice of slavery wrong in contemporary western society than in ancient Greek society; more comfortable judging a friend wrong to divorce his wife than someone with whom we have no connection. Even if empathy is ultimately reducible to a brain process (which I doubt), the historical content of empathetic attention is not.Harris wants to replace all appeals to abstract moral values by a grounded empirical analysis of consciousness and environment. We certainly cannot afford to ignore the latest scientific findings in evaluating the human condition, but this book manages, somehow, to ignore history, and that is equally unaffordable. Rather than trying to objectify consciousness in natural terms, Harris would be better advised to acknowledge Kierkegaard’s dictum that we become who we are and have no essential nature. Things happen to us as individuals, and it is how we react and cope with them that forms the basis of our morality."
17,1439171211,http://goodreads.com/user/show/597461-elyse-walters,5,"This book is amazing!!!!!!! It keep me awake at night--turned me upside down-and back around!This just might have been the most valuable book I've read in years! My husband is going to read it now, too."
18,1439171211,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3710740-robert,1,"In this work, the prominent critic of religion, Sam Harris, argues that a comprehensive morality can be established using the well-being of conscious entities as the single normative value. ""Good"" is whatever contributes to this well-being. And ""Science"" is the arbitrator of what constitutes that well-being. It is the final arbitrator, the judge of what actions, behaviors, serve this goal. And there is no absolute good. As science's understanding of human well-being deepens, becomes more complete, all value judgments, all political systems, economies, societies, cultures, will be continuously reassessed and modified, fine-tuned, to ensure that they produce the optimal ""well-being"". This is not a new idea. Is just a variety of consequential utilitarianism: ""The most good for the greatest number"" but with the ""good"" to be verified experientially by its actual beneficial results. This is more of less conventional, common sense ethics - the way most people determine what to do - what is best. But this is not formal academic ethics. Harris makes no effort to theoretically establish this ""well-being"" as the highest value - beyond making the simple statement that he can think of nothing better. Nor does he consider how such a general goal could possibly motivate compliance - that is, why anyone would act according to this norm - why anyone would pay a price, no matter how slight, to serve this vague end. His implication is that they would just recognize it as the right thing to do and do it. This is arguing in circles - i.e., there is a deeper norm, the ""right thing"", and ""increasing well-being"" serves this deeper value. However, an even greater problem with Harris' argument is that he radicalizes his concept of ""well-being"" by insisting that it is to be restricted to ""the level of the brain"" - to the physical level, the level of the neuron. This is odd, unusual. It turns ethics into biology, into neurology. Perhaps he does this out of a desire to foreclose the application of ""well-being"" to minds, to souls, to things that science is unable to evaluate, whose well-being it cannot measure. Perhaps, he fears that otherwise there may be an opening for religion, for spiritual values. Course, at the ""level of the brain"", where everything is reduced to the physical level, to chemical and electrical properties and processes, everything is determined by scientific laws - therefore predetermined by natural laws. There is no ""free will"". And Harris embraces this. To him, thoughts and memories and images are not the product of volitional minds. They are phenomena produced by chemical and electrical processes. The consciousness is not in control - is completely dependent on the material actions of the physical brain. Hence has no independent volition. Has no free will. But if this is true, then ethical thought has no purpose, and Harris' book is useless. So why did he write it? He has, as his previous books prove, a great antipathy towards religion. Perhaps here he is attempting to strip religion of its value as a positive ethical force, to show that it is not necessary by providing an alternative ethics, one without any appeal to spiritual values - to remove completely from moral thought any concept of ""soul"" . But with that gone, man is only a material entity. His individuality is reduced to his DNA. He has no intrinsic worth. His only value is whatever he contributes to the general well-being. Human rights disappear - the individual is no longer a Kantian end - but a means. Once respect for each individual is lost, the door opens to ""scientific"" theories on how to make things better - opens to clever ""rational"" ways ""to increase the general well-being"". Folks tried this in the last century - some with attempts to create a communitarian, classless utopia, while others wanted to form a more perfect world by removing the unhealthy, by creating a superior humanity, a ""master race"". These attempts did not work out well. No ethical system that ignores the human spirit can. Harris regards man as a body, a physical entity, with his mind, his soul, only an unimportant phenomenon created by that body. This is mistaken. Science itself is the mental phenomenon - a construct - valuable, indispensable - but still a construct - something we use to explain what happens, what we see. Our true core reality is our conscious minds and the minds we encounter - the other spirits we meet. These are all that we can truly know - they are the loci of all value - the ends of all ethical thought. The ""scientific"" ethics Harris proposes in this book is closer to animal husbandry - a ""how-to"" book on keeping the herd healthy and content. "
19,1439171211,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5686119-book,5,"The Moral Landscape by Sam Harris Sam Harris is fast becoming one of my favorite authors and that is with just three books under his belt. In the Moral Landscape, Sam Harris makes a much needed statement for our time: Morality should be put under the scrutiny of science. Sam Harris a neuroscientist himself, states ""that once we understand ourselves at the level of the brain, the more we will see there are right and wrong answers to questions of human values."" I couldn't agree more. This book is important for many reasons. Religion has failed to provide the proper moral guidance that it claims to make. Steps in Sam Harris and provides the proper approach to take: these questions of morality...we know where the answers are, in our brains. It is his contention that morality must relate to facts about ""well-being"" of conscious creatures, and off he goes in a world where science can tackle the most important questions about our world in an objective and scientific manner. Morality needs and can be studied scientifically, and no one can explain it better than Sam Harris. I bought the Kindle version of the book and I must say that Amazon did a wonderful job of making sure that all the links work properly. It's a good thing too because the author makes a lot of great references. The book is broken out into five chapters and an excellent introduction: Chapter 1 - Moral Truth. In this chapter Sam Harris really lays the ground work for his main proposition of the book: we need a science of morality because it will enable humans with an objective tool to better our world. As a freethinker, I can be swayed with compelling information and the author does exactly that. I always considered myself a moral relativist, I guess in large part to make it perfectly clear from my point of view, objective morality can NOT be achieved with a non-existing supernatural entity. In particular because there are many supernatural entities to choose from. So morality at that point would be relative to the ""God"" of your choice and hence relative. Of course, Sam Harris alters my thinking in a positive way. Science can establish the framework to an objective morality. Chapter 2 - Good and Evil. This chapter deals with the understanding of good and evil in scientific terms. It also includes the necessary coupling of philosophy and science. ""This is where a science of morality could be indispensable to us: the more we understand the causes and constituents of human fulfillment, and the more we know about the experiences of our fellow human beings, the more we will be able to make intelligent decisions about which social policies to adopt."" This captures the essence of this chapter. Chapter 3 - Belief. In this chapter Sam Harris introduces some neurological terms such as: medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) that helps better understand the workings of the brain and how it relates to beliefs. Many great examples of how we obtain our beliefs , ""feeling of knowing"", and religious beliefs to name a few. I also enjoyed his explanation for scientific validity. Chapter 4 - Religion. In probably my favorite chapter, Sam Harris tackles religion. Great discussions in this chapter: an explanation of religion and how the brain is predisposed to religious thoughts, delusions, the soul (this brief section alone is worth the price of the book) , also a good discussion on altruism, and how religious dogmatism presents an obstacle to scientific reasoning . Chapter 5 - The Future of Happiness. In an uncharacteristic manner, Sam Harris provides an optimistic outlook for the future. A future in which science can lead morality grounded in reason to a better future. In summary, this is a well researched book by a great author. I highly recommend it!"
20,1439171211,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2160536-marvin,3,"I find Sam Harris to be the most interesting and least abrasive of the so-called new atheists, a group that is comprised of Richard Dawkins, Christopher Hitchens, and others. But in his earlier The End of Faith he was taken to task by atheists and believers alike for suggesting that what we call Spirituality may exist, although not in the sense of the supernatural, and may actually be measurable by scientific means. Harris takes a similar stance in The Moral Landscape regarding morality. He criticizes both the religious idea that moralality comes from God but also the common scientific viewpoint that morality had no scientific basis and is culturally relative. He sees morality as a concept that is ripe for scientific exploration. That there may someday be science based guidelines that will help us know what is right and what is wrong. A few ideas...1. Morality is the responses and actions that lead to our well-being and happiness.1. Some ideas lead to happiness and well-being better than others and these may exist in the realm of scientific inquiry.3. Religion is a poor arbitrator of guidelines for morality as they are based on fictitious ideas. For instance, if it is true there is a heaven full of virgins for martyrs of the faith, then suicide bombers are immensely moral people. Almost all of us would disagree with that, but it is unarguable that their erroneous belief justify the act as moral in their minds. In other words, our concept of morality may be based on myths and lies.4. Therefore morality constitutes a landscape of behaviors and actions that can be determined by logic, reason, and the discovery of scientific evidence for how to live in a a moral way.I've probably over-simplified Harris' basic thesis yet I believe Harris has a good idea. You are not going to find too many answers in this book. The author is mainly setting up the foundation to why scientific exploration of morality is plausible. Yet there is plenty of research information, and more footnotes I've ever seen for a layman's book..slightly under half the book is appendixes...that bolster his arguments. While Harris does remain critical of religion, you will find little sniping and rudeness in these pages. I found this book to be informative and though-provoking. It will be interesting to watch where the discussion takes us.Three and a half stars."
21,1439171211,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6080598-bakunin,1,"Yet another believer in objective morality. To Harris morality, to be crude, is any set of rules that maximizes wellbeing of the largest possible number of people on the planet. I'm not positive if he thinks that this is objective morality, because it is obviously not. Morality is subjective like most things and it is usually justified by expression of power. 	I'll give a hypothetical example. Let's say that a horrible virus started spreading around the globe and humans are dying rapidly. There is a cure but to utilize it we must take radical measures. Let's say that scientists had discovered a cure but to create one cure for one person you need, let's say two human livers. So in other words to save one life you must take two. If you don't do this, everybody dies. If you do it few survive and not the majority. You can't just save the children because without adults they'll be lost. So children must die too. How can these two choices be justified as moral? I'm not sure.If you go with morality everybody dies. If you renounce it, few survive but at tremendous cost. The example is extreme, I realise that, but Harris doesn't address it. At least I can't recall any such example. 	 What's happening in the book is what happens in every book written by a person that believes in objective morality(Ayn Rand). You have a person that is trying to subjectively set what moral behaviours is and try to convince as many people as possible that their way is the right way. Then, when or if they manage to get the mob on their side, they would proclaim their subjective morality as objective one. This is done in religion, where morality is a set of rules given to us by god. In this book morality is a set of rules given to us by science or by Sam Harris. I agree with Harris when it comes to trying to maximise wellbeing of the global population because this way you are creating healthier and more productive society. But there will be times when this doesn't apply. And to claim that this is moral is simply trying to proclaim that your idea of morality is ""right"" and noting more. If he went another route and claimed that we should look at things from what works and what doesn't perspective, in other words rely on practicality and not morality I might of have bought the ""wellbeing"" concept; otherwise one star."
22,1439171211,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24258499-alan-johnson,3,"Since at least World War II, the social “sciences” have followed the “hard” sciences in insisting that “facts” can be known while “values” cannot be known. Indeed, following Max Weber and others, values have long been considered to be merely subjective preferences that cannot be demonstrated to be true or false (or valid or invalid) by either philosophy (inductive and deductive reasoning) or science. This view necessarily implies moral or cultural relativism. A few twentieth-century scholars in the field of philosophy or political philosophy (notably Leo Strauss) and at least one twenty-first-century scientist (neuroscientist Sam Harris) have insisted that the traditional fact-value dichotomy is incorrect. Rather, “values” can be determined rationally or scientifically and are not relative to culture or individual preference. We can say, for example, that cannibalism or genocide is wrong without merely expressing a subjective preference. In articulating this position from a scientific perspective, Sam Harris has expanded the concept of science beyond testability to mean rationality in a more philosophical sense. See Harris, The Moral Landscape: How Science Can Determine Human Values (Free Press, 2010). Is Harris correct? Is this where science and philosophy meet?I do not necessarily agree with Harris on all issues. For example, he seems to me to contradict himself on the question of free will (we apparently don't have free will except when liberating ourselves from religion), and I'm not too sure about the ease with which he moves back and forth between individual and collective well being (a difficult question involving both ethical and political philosophy, including but not limited to means and ends issues). But I find his rejection of the fact-value dichotomy quite interesting, even though I might have a somewhat different way of approaching the issue.Harris has been harshly attacked by left-wing academia for rejecting cultural relativism (see his ""Afterword"" to the paperback and Kindle editions of The Moral Landscape). He has long, of course, been attacked from the right for being a proponent of the ""New Atheism."" I tend to think that both critiques are misguided, though, again, I don't necessarily agree with the entirety of his analysis."
23,1439171211,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4249546-ben,5,"Let's ask a simple question: ""Is it wrong to torture children?"" The only possible answer, it seems, is yes, of course it is. And yet, as Harris argues, link such torture with the ""cultural traditions"" of a particular religion , and the respondent will hum and haw about the relativity of morals and freedom of religion. My example is not that outlandish; consider how hesitant many are to criticize the practice of female genital mutilation: an unequivocally barbaric practice, yet not universally condemned lest one would offend certain religious sensibilities.Harris’s thesis is simple and eloquently argued. There is a real thing called “well-being,” which can be a measure of the quality of one’s life; generally speaking we should encourage those practices which improve well-being, and condemn those which reduce well-being. Nuance is not lost on Harris; certainly, there can be debate about what constitutes well-being, and about whose well-being is more important; in principal though, these are questions that can be answered based on actual empirically derived data. In other words, we can link our values to what we know about the world, and not be beholden to this or that ancient book.In postulating this theory, Harris anticipates pissing off the two groups who currently monopolize moral discourse: religious conservatives and multicultural liberals. The first group insist that morality can be realized within the confines of one’s own religious doctrine; the second puts forth the feeble and self-contradictory notion that “all values are relative,” thereby refusing to challenge religious dogmatists, even as the latter espouse such lovely practices as child abuse and domestic violence, and actively oppose the basic human rights of homosexuals and minority groups. As Harris points out, we can achieve a real conversation about the “good life,” but we first have to discard notions that religious doctrines are beyond criticism."
24,1439171211,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1652517-merilee,4,"Harris attempts to show that one can define good vs bad scientifically, and we will be able to do so even better as brain scanning tools become more sophisticated. For him good means providing the most well-being for the most people (and most defnitely leaves religion out of the equation). There is not usually only one good way of doing things, there being ""many peaks on the moral landscape."" Much of the book is a bit vague, but this may be my inability to follow all his philoso-speak. His 24-minute talk at Ted is a terrific summary of his ideas.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hj9oB4..."
25,1439171211,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1879990-adam,3,"The Moral Landscape is an easy book to criticize. Its thesis is both less controversial than it thinks it is, but still sufficiently worth stating that there is a lot more to say about it than Harris manages to say. Structurally each chapter feels disconnected from the overall argument and varies wildly in quality. No one will be surprised to hear that Harris devotes an entire chapter to religion-bashing. Some of this does bear on his point, but there's a strong sense that the dog wearing glasses giving this lecture just saw the mailman go by. A less foregone issue is that Harris simply isn't a particularly good science writer, so his neuroscience chapter, while interesting, could almost certainly have been done better by someone else. In general, he is a clear, forceful, and level-headed writer but even outside of the religion chapter there are certain triggering topics that do give the sort of cringe inducing impression that Harris couldn't, or decided he would rather not, exercise self-conscious circumspection in the editing process. Most of those triggering issues are probably obvious (Islam, the taboo against criticizing religion, the stigmatization of atheists, etc.) but the one that really mattered to me was relativism. This was the whole reason I picked this book up in the first place: it seems to represent the clearest statement of the anti-theist belief that science can replace religion as a source of absolute knowledge about the world. To be honest, I was expecting a relatively shitty argument I could knock down to show the superiority of my own position. Instead, I found a more or less satisfactory version of that same argument. That is, an explicitly relativist argument for morality. The confounding part, though, is that ""relativists"" are the single greatest bugbear of the whole book. As many advocates of relativism note, it's hard to spend too much time arguing with religious people about the philosophical nature of truth and morality because they are very straightforward and honest about their incompatible position. So as much as Harris likes trashing religious people, his main interlocutors here are stereotypical liberal academics who accept a version of postmodernism that claims morality is culturally contingent.What makes this so frustrating and confusing is that Harris is really bad at distinguishing the precise difference between his position and their position. Politically, his thesis – morality means increasing the well-being, or decreasing the suffering, of conscious creatures – is so broad that it almost by definition includes every common sense and intuitive take on the topic. Secular humanists, and especially the secular Left, take it for granted that everyone believes an even narrower version of this thesis (ie Harris explicitly argues that religious ideas assuming souls persist into the afterlife where they suffer or thrive are compatible with this idea) even when this is not entirely true. Philosophically, things get a little more dicey. Harris wants the philosophical status of moral ideas to be the centerpiece of the book, but he is wary of entering the fray as a normal participant in the discourse of metaethics. He at least pays more lip service to the importance of philosophy than many of the New Atheists do, but he stopped short of actually placing his thesis within the existing language of that field.That leaves Harris crusading against ""moral relativism"" by arguing that ""values only exist relative to the well-being of conscious creatures."" So as often as he presents anecdotes about the frustrating conversations he has with relativist-as-a-pejorative liberals, it's hard not to wonder if the confusion is just semantic. In clear terms, the position he is arguing against is called normative relativism: the norm that we should be tolerant of other moral viewpoints because we have no absolute grounds to prefer ours over theirs. Harris never uses this term, and instead slanders people who (seem to) hold this position as multiculturalists, postmodernists, or just relativists. I say seem to because it isn't actually clear that anyone truly holds this position. As widespread as Harris believes it is in academia, it is somewhat surprising he can't point to a contemporary advocate outside of a random conversation he had with a bioethicist and an anthropology paper from 70 years ago. Neither of those cases convinced me that those people were in fact normative relativists. It seems much more likely that both of them are simply descriptive relativists who at worst have not thought through the implications of that position as well as they might have.That's why my main takeaway is kind of that it's unfortunate it was Harris who decided to write this book. Because I think there is actually an important point to be made here, a clarification of what a relativist morality actually does and does not mean. It's easy to imagine a Leftist philosopher making the same case but without ruffling feathers of its target audience by openly insulting them and misunderstanding the value of some of their core insight. In a sense, this is the opposite counterpart of Bloor's Knowledge and Social Imagery. Bloor argues that scientific knowledge, which we intuitively except as objective and implicitly absolute, is in fact only true relative to social norms – though, importantly, social norms are not as unstable as we tend to believe. Harris, conversely, points out that while (nonreligious) people tend to treat morality as a kind of emphatic preference, it's actually a lot more like scientific knowledge. That is to say, it is socially negotiated with reference to a complex web of norms and values, many of which are shared or translatable across cultures and therefore admit a meaningful sense of permanence and thus a substantial, if imperfect, degree of objectivity. I think this is a genuinely novel point for public discourse, even if it probably isn't unprecedented in the philosophical literature. Of course, this point is confused by the fact that Harris (without any stated grounds to do so) doesn't seem to treat scientific knowledge as relativist in the way Bloor would, and often takes its unproblematic objectivity for granted in the same way he wants us to extend to moral truths. It's further confused when he does in fact give a few distinct arguments demonstrating why scientific knowledge is relative in that same way – radical skepticism shows that scientific knowledge cannot be justified absolutely, neuroscience finds no distinction between scientific and moral belief, etc. It just doesn't seem to matter to him.The reason for that is likely that once again he's using the term relative in a different way as everyone else. For him, it means something very different for something to be true relative to cultural context rather than biological context. This is also something I think bears exploring for postmodernists, but at the same time seems already self-evident. I think you'd be hard-pressed to find a historian sufficiently relativist to argue that slaves enjoyed their bondage because they didn't have access to a moral system that could condemn it. Harris clearly believes this sort of position is common, but that seems to only be because he tends to overreact and misinterpret much more reasonable positions. For instance, on the topic of female genital mutilation, the anthropological debate, such as one even exists, advocates collecting objective data from people who have experienced the custom and empowering potential subjects to make their own informed decisions. As much as Harris wants to imagine that such things are morally wrong a priori, this approach is entirely in line with the one he is advocating. As he would put it, if that investigation finds that FGM increases the well-being of conscious creatures, so be it.Even though Harris can be a bit of a churl about it, I find myself still more or less agreeing with positions on religious and ""scientism"" that a lot of my current ideological company would find objectionable. But his attitudes to anthropology and the cultures it studies are genuinely pretty disappointing, and I think do more to discredit his argument than anything else. I will go along with him far enough to agree that, if we can make negative judgments about the cosmology, medical knowledge, or ecology of historical peoples and nonscientific subcultures both inside and outside of the West, we can make similar negative judgments about their moral positions. To be fair, I think I have to admit I would only have agreed to that statement before I read this book depending on how it was phrased. He's actually clarified my own postmodernist worldview in a meaningful way. The problem is just that he never really grapples with the problems that cultural differences pose to studying moral landscape. He just avoids the conversation by binning some into ""just details we'll figure out with research"" and the rest into ""objectively wrong."" It isn't so much that that's wrong as that it's a copout, and worse, one motivated more by disdain for the idea that the muddy water there could trip up any useful application of his question than by a simple decision about scope. It's also worth noting that one of the main reasons Harris wants to define his relativist moral epistemology as a form of absolutism is because he can use it as a bludgeon against religion. This is the universal appeal of absolutes, and it isn't particularly surprising, but I just don't can get over how thoroughly he can subscribe to relativist positions and yet still, after all that thinking and writing, convert them to absolutism in order to bolster the superficial power of his rhetoric even though he must know that isn't actually a particularly useful tool in convincing the people he wants to convert. This ties into the previous point, because familiarity with the anthropological literature seemingly give him some more respect for the mechanisms that perpetuate belief. You can say someone is objectively wrong, or call them an imbecile (something Harris resorts to more than a more self-aware writer would), but neither of those tactics are likely to win you converts to the cause of objectively improving the well-being of the world's conscious creatures. "
26,1439171211,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2105523-bob-nichols,2,"Harris starts out strong. He argues that we can have a science of morality. Just as there is a general definition of bodily health, he argues that science can tell us how to interact with others. Just as we ought to promote our own welfare, we ought to maximize the welfare of others. Of course, this bumps into the argument that science can't tell us how we ought to live. Harris sidesteps that criticism by, in effect, stating that critics can fiddle with that line of thought all they want but he's going to stipulate the obvious: promoting survival and well-being is not only an obvious good for most, it is also consistent with evolutionary theory. He makes a helpful distinction between ""answers in practice"" and ""answers in principle"" to emphasize that while we may disagree about what ""well-being"" (our own and others) means, that concept is valid as a principle for morality. We can study ""subjective"" facts objectively, he writes.Then Harris goes astray. He largely dismisses evolution's relevance to our moral life. What Harris wants is a science of morals, which is a one-hundred percent intellectual enterprise. Harris has the mind take control of our beings so that we leave our ""apish ways"" behind. ""Most of what constitutes human well-being,"" he writes, ""escapes any narrow Darwinian calculus."" Of Pinker, Harris writes that, ""if conforming to the dictates of evolution were the foundation of subjective well-being, most men would discover no higher calling in life than to make daily contributions to their local sperm bank."" There are a few problems with Harris's approach. Evolution is more than depositing sperm. In fact, there's a strong body of evidence indicating that cooperation is fundamental to the viability of our species, probably because individual survival depends on the support network of the group. Second, evolution most likely designed all sorts of other-oriented emotions and behaviors (love, compassion, empathy, fairness and loyalty) conducive to restricting the self in deference to others. Third, Harris makes an iffy leap when he states that one should maximize the well-being of others and that ""we genuinely want fair and just societies."" That flies in the face of the evidence of a good part of history and contemporary life. If we're excessively self-oriented, why should we care about others? If we're loyal to our group, why should we care about the welfare of other groups? Evolutionary theory is relevant here as well. Those who are nurturing by nature may have a natural inclination to respect others; for those who are not, they may nevertheless respect the interests of others because they see such behavior benefiting their own interest in the long-run (as a utilitarian calculus). Fourth, in dismissing the animal side, Harris seems to be arguing that reason alone can transform our natures to accord with his scientific view of things. That leaves too much deference to ""reason"" versus, say, the observation of Hobbes that, in the end, power is essential to preserve order and some semblance of justice. Reason alone cannot do the job. Finally, Harris's faith in reason and science has a hint of arrogance and intolerance about it. In response to criticism of ""Orwellian moral experts"" telling people what to do, Harris writes revealingly that ""If there were a way for you and those you care about to be much happier than you now are, would you want to know about it?"" Happiness is such a subjective thing and is most likely highly variable among individuals and groups. Harris's criticism of veiled women may not be as offensive to the women themselves as it is to Harris.Harris is right to argue that the standard of morality is our well-being. His argument about why we should restrict the maximization of our well being out of deference to others and affirmatively promote their well being is weak. We do that because either we are naturally inclined to be that way, or because we make the utilitarian calculus that it's in our own interest to promote the good of all. The latter translates into a golden rule type of principle that says that it's in our interest to respect the interests of others. What that principle means in practice is where the real challenge lies and where a hefty dose of tolerance and humility is needed. "
27,1439171211,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13438159-dan,2,"I must first admit, I was skeptical that science could answer questions about morality but I was hopeful that Dr. Harris, with a degree in philosophy and a PhD in neuroscience, might be the one with a sound argument as to how and why science might be the answer.I was hopeful because I agree with him that there is [currently] no such thing as Christian or Muslim [or other religious] morality… that “the mere endurance of a belief system or custom does not suggest that it is adaptive much less wise,” that it is possible for people to believe and to value the wrong things… that science and religion are antithetical and will “never come to terms,” and especially, that “the chief enemy of open conversation is dogmatism in all its forms.”I also think Harris is right to make the distinction between pleasure and well-being.  Perhaps most important is Harris’s assessment that “this faith in the intrinsic limits of reason is now the received opinion in intellectual circles.”  “There is an epidemic of scientific ignorance in the United States… few things make thinking like a scientist more difficult that an attachment to religion” he tells us. Although I believe this assessment is correct, I find it to be a frightening characterization of todays “intellectuals.”Unfortunately, I remain unconvinced with the argument made by Sam Harris. He tell us very clearly that his argument is that ""questions about values - about meaning, morality and life's larger purpose - are really questions about the well-being of conscious creatures... and therefore, translate into facts that can be scientifically understood."" And he states that understanding of the brain will give us ""the right and wrong answers to questions of human values.""He then tells us the alternatives: ""to invoke God; [or] to give voice to ones apish urges, cultural biases, and philosophical confusion. Of course, he is correct. Today's values are determined almost exclusively by culture, tradition, and interpretation of the Bible, Koran, the Tanakh (and other documents of the Jewish faith). I would argue, as I believe the author implies, that the ""values"" these latter provide are, in fact, also derived from culture and tradition. To his last alternative - ""philosophical confusion"" he is also right. But this one, I believe, can and should be corrected and it is due to an epidemic of philosophical ignorance. Harris is right to look to science for answers to this problem, but we should not give up on philosophy either.It is the clearly articulated premises that I believe is incorrect: ""human well being entirely depends on events in the world and on states of the human brain."" ""Consequently, there must be scientific truths to be known about it [which will] ""force us to draw clear distinctions between different ways of living... judging some to be better or worse, more or less true to the facts, and more or less ethical.""I believe this premise to be wrong on several levels. Foremost is his conviction that ""well-being"" is the goal. This begs the question. Well-being of what? He tells us: ""questions about values... are really questions about the well-being of conscious creatures.He then argues that the ultimate value can be determined ""if only we can obtain facts about how the brain responds.""But a brain that is in a state of drug-induced euphoria may provide scientific indicator that jumping out of an automobile traveling at high speed is a sensible thing to do. Or it may show that rats on LSD light up the indicators like nothing else. Does this prove that the ultimate value is rats on LSD? Or, if we are convinced that 'man' is the ultimate value - the standard of reference for all decisions about what we ought or ought not do - does this example prove that anything, including drugs, that create a state of euphoria, is the correct measure of this ""ultimate value.""?"
28,1439171211,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3038974-steve-van-slyke,4,"It's not often than one gets read something about a genuinely new theory that has far reaching implications for all of mankind (think Einstein/Relativity, Newton/Gravity, etc.). It's also unusual that someone develops such a theory and then has the courage to put themselves and their reputation on the line in the world spotlight. It seems like Sam Harris has done that with this book.Whether you buy into Harris' thesis or not I cannot see how one could help but admire his courage for putting it out there, knowing that some of the big guns of philosophy, religion, and even science would begin shelling him with heavy artillery.The analogy of well-being-is-to-science as health-is-to-medicine (in the Afterword), really helped convince me that he has a theory that should be seriously considered and attacked in the time-honored methods of good scientific practice. It will be interesting to see which scientists and philosophers jump on board. Putting out a theory like this one is a big risk, but if it slowly gains support and leads to further inquiry, Harris might live to be rewarded by one day seeing his name in history books as the person that initiated a new branch of scientific endeavor.One of the parts that I struggled with was the section on Free Will. This is not the first time I have read about the various theories of Free Will, and unfortunately this one also failed to make it crystal clear for me what the argument is about. I am still looking for something like “Free Will for Idiots”. Whoa, I just discovered that Harris has a new book coming out next month titled....”Free Will”.It ended rather abruptly for me. I was hoping for and expecting some kind of road map for what the next steps should be to test and validate or invalidate the theory, but perhaps that is the topic of another book.When someone like Deepak Chopra trashes the book in a review without even having read it that tells you something has certainly struck a nerve and may be worth checking out. It seems as if some of the criticism aimed at Harris and the book are based more on a dislike of the messenger than a dislike of the message. If Harris was not the vocal critic of the three great monotheisms that he is, I wonder if the rhetoric in some of the reviews might have been a little more reasoned and softer in tone"

We will embarrass our descendants, just as out ancestors embarrass us. This is moral progress.While this book can be read as a standalone, it is written as a response to the criticism and further discussion of moral philosophy and the scientific basis behind ethics that he put forth in 2004 in The End of Faith. I seem to be reading Harris books in reverse order (this my second book of his, after reading his most recent Waking Up in 2015), and I am still learning a lot, but I would recommend going in chronological order if you are interested in Harris.There are plenty of moral dilemmas framed here - classic psychological/philosophical scenarios where we are asked to make a decision for well-being or happiness of all, even if it means that something bad has to happen to get there. Harris discusses morality distinct from religion, and the scientific basis for it - embracing this idea of well-being for all creatures, human and animal. There are some pretty disturbing topics covered as well - psychopathy and those who generally lack morality. And as one now expects in any Harris work, there is a systematic breakdown of how science and faith are completely incompatible. He specifically calls out Francis Collins, one of the most outspoken (and well-regarded) scientists who is also a deeply religious (Christian) believer.This book was published in 2010, and the book's arguments ring truer than ever with the rise of ISIS, the Charlie Hebdo attacks, the refugee crisis, the continued fundamentalist bent in American politics, etc. I have some reservations (hence the 4 stars) about ALL that Harris puts forward, but he makes some very compelling statements. I want to follow this up by reading his standalone essays on Free Will and Lying. "
30,1439171211,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4251182-david,3,A very uneven book with some glaring overstatements and a dodgy premise (morality based upon well-being and the enterprise of an empirical morality). This book will most likely appeal to those attracted to the other New Atheists...such as Dawkins and Hitchens. Makes some good points but gets a tad hysterical/hostile and doesn't really draw the reader along...mostly bludgeons them with facts which the author would require you to assume are wholly without debate...as well he tends to cherry pick the most horrendous examples of moral abuses amongst conservatives (religious or otherwise). We must accept that Harris is a journalist (though he read Philosophy @ Standford) and trained to create simple narratives for people to follow...but that training doesn't work with this subject. More subtlety of thought and rhetoric is required and the reader does not receive this. He also seems out of this depth when attempting to communicate complex philosophical and scientific concepts. I'm not suggesting he is wrong...he just doesn't communicate them clearly and elegantly. Books like this one need both skills...he just doesn't have enough of them to carry the weight of the subject. He tends to shift from complex meandering to moronic narrative examples which seems pulled directly from Fox News or the Daily Show...similar to these at least.I would recommend a pass on this unless you are a recent convert to atheism and are still very angry with religion. Note: I am an atheist and have been one since 14.
31,1439171211,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2343621-andrew,5,"We, or at least I, tend to flock to authors who verbalize my innermost thoughts, those which I am either unable or unwilling to voice. This drew me to 2004's ""End of Faith"", a book which forever changed the course of my thinking about religion, piety, or even the wisdom of religious moderation. ""Letters to a Christian Nation"" was Harris' mass-market appeal to the bullet points of EOF, if you will. But ""The Moral Landscape"" has another audience entire.Imagine that we could objectively quantify the moral superiority of certain cultures, ways of dress, religious practices, views about women, reading lists, thoughts about the hereafter, and their attendant effects on human well-being. Wouldn't this be a field worthy of intense consideration and study? Harris believes so to such a degree that he is focusing his doctoral and now life's work towards supposing this is true. The peaks and valleys on the moral landscape may well be a path to the future of human happiness. He does not assert that we must strive for every peak, or that such is even discernible, but that we must admit, right out, that certain questions have answers. And that differences between cultures, on matters of human well being, matter."
32,1439171211,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3715786-stobrawa,5,"According to Harris: ""It seems to me that the only way we are going to build a global civilization based on shared values--allowing us to converge on the same political, economic, and environmental goals--is to admit that questions about right and wrong and good and evil have answers, in the same way the questions about human health do."" It's hard to get past much of the morally relativist programming of a modern secular society without toggling over to religious dogmatism. But, if we stop and listen to Sam, we see that there is a very murky area between moral relativism on one side and the black and white world of religious superstition on the other. Sam is trying to start the discussion that will ultimately carve the scientific truth of morality--of human and animal well-being--out of that murky, gray area. Sam's arguments don't have to be great, they just have to be interesting enough for the scientifically-inclined to start teasing out these often neglected truths. Sam's arguments are more than interesting enough for that.This book is the beginning of the discussion that should have started a century ago. "

Then it quickly became insufferable. I think that on the one hand we do have to look at fundamentalism and ask ourselves how people get to this mindset where they justify heinous activity under the influence of extremist religion. But on the other hand it seems that taking it as either far left or far right and pointing to this as the ""wrong of the religion"" is extreme as most people take a middle ground. I think Sam is unaffected by the middle ground. Its all in or all out. I can appreciate this in him as a person and I would like him in real life I imagine but his writing comes across as very condescending to a large middle ground majority.

39,1439171211,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2920307-david,4,"The basic idea of the book is that science can build an evidence-based foundation for human morals. (That is, atttitudes, policies, social environments, etc. that improve or maintain the well-being of intelligent beings. ""Well-being"" referring to the health, happiness and similar beneficial aspects of material beings, it doesn't claim to deal with immaterial beings people may believe in.)Keep in mind, I was sympathetic to the book's concept from the beginning, but I may have expressed things differently or varied on emphasis in places. The focus on the material world may make religious people think it is incomplete, although there is much overlap between what is considered ""right"" and ""wrong"" by major religions and secular governments. To a large extent, where non-theocratic governments and religions differ are areas where most religious people would consider to be private matters between the individual and their god (they don't expect the government to arrest people for eating on religious fast days or such). Of course, there are some issues such as abortion where religious organizations may try to enact laws consistent with their religous doctrines. From a secular point of view, there may be a need to clarify aspects of such matters, such as what organic matter deserves the legal protections of a human being. If a person intentionally destroys a unit of donated blood, is it murder because human cells die? What if the blood donor has died, so the blood is the last living part of that human? If not, when does an embryo / fetus become different? It may be tricky to define what makes a protected human life, but it would provide a clear basis for such decisions - and a basis which doesn't simply quote the assertions of one of the various differeing religions.The author may at times be sharper than needed in criticizing religion. But I appreciate the basic points. Science at least attempts to establish a solid basis for what it puts forward, while religous people feel no more need than having a gut feeling something is right. Numerous cases are available of religion refusing (at least for extanded periods of tiem) to accept evidence contrary to ancient texts. Religious wars, inquisitions, discrimination and such have been used to impose religion on others.I agree with the book's premise that scientists have been too inclined to take a cautious approach to criticizing religious practices which are contrary to human well-being. Science could use criteria of physical and emotinal well-being to guage whether Americans following an Amish lifestyle or a more modern lifestyle achieve a better level. Scientists could give an evidence-based analysis of the differing consequences of following a ""be fruitful and multiply"" or population growth sensitive approach. It shouldn't be necessary to say all religious practices are indistinguishable in impact on human lives (or to be quiet or vague on the issue).One of the arguments others use against the book's advocacy of building a scientifically-based morality of human well-being is that humans need the religious-based morallity that is current today to limit some harmful actions. Even assuming it would be unwise to weaken religious morality in the short-term, that doesn't seem a reason not to try to construct something better to take over in the future.One of the things science has helped us see is that consciousness and free will are not what we've assumed or what most people would like to believe. Conscious thought is what percolates up from unconscious regions in order to help us do such things as justify ourselves to others or attempt to get others to do something. We have conscious ""experience,"" but even that is edited on an unconscious level. For instance, your unconscious edits out the sensory data which results from the blinking of your eyes. To one degree or another, when the unconscious lets the conscious know what it wants or intends, the conscious mind can try to veto it; but since the conscious is only the tip of the iceberg, a ""conscious veto"" may really be one part of the unconscious vetoing another part. I don't think the author directed these considerations enough in his discussion of religion. The actions of individuals who perceive themselves as acting upon religious beliefs have consequences regardless of whether the religion is truly the cause or just a post-hoc rationalization. However, understanding to what degree the motives are actually something else disguised in religious garb in order to justify to others could lead us to a different approach to dealing with it."
40,1439171211,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12831990-jason,3,"I find myself somehow conflicted about a book that I agree with virtually from cover to cover. I appreciate the message that 'moral truths exist'; that morality can be discussed from a logical, fact based, proof supported, point of view seems obvious, but is still an argument that in our society and time needs to be made and Harris makes a good case. I personally had two issues, (1) it felt like preaching to the converted in my case - which is more about me -, and (2) large chunks of the persuasive text seemed to be more about Harris himself than about the ideas and it's support.In order to convince the reader that logic and science can and should be utilized in the efforts of morality, Harris has to also make the case against the current 'owners' of the moral territory - religious groups/individuals - and while I believe this is exceedingly well reasoned, I doubt whether someone who is not predisposed to such arguments will accept them. Because most religions conceive of their morality as a matter of being obedient to the word of God (generally for the sake of receiving supernatural reward), their precepts often have nothing to do with maximizing well-being in this world. Religious believers can, therefore, assert the immortality of contraception, masturbation, homosexuality,etc., without ever feeling obliged to argue that these practices actually cause suffering. They can also pursue aims that are flagrantly immoral, in that they needlessly perpetuate human misery, while believing that these actions are morally obligatory. This pious uncoupling of moral concern from the reality of human and animal suffering has caused tremendous harm. What Harris is essentially trying to propose is a philosophy on how we should act in order to propagate and cultivate 'well-being' for self and society; he is attempting to teach people to think in a scientific manner about things that we traditionally have been taught is not to be thought of in such terms. Believe a proposition because it is well supported be theory and evidence; believe it because it has been experimentally verified; believe it because a generation of smart people have tried their best to falsify it and failed; believe it because it is true (or seems so). This is an effort I believe worth while. Conversation is key and I think this is the real goal for Harris, to continue to be part of the discussion and make incremental movement in the direction of well supported decisions in the realm of morality. He believes that science and the scientific method has too long surrendered the moral ground to religion, and the question may be at this point and in this climate whether the scientific viewpoint will even be allowed a seat at the table, and on this point Harris is not immediately optimistic. At the end of Harris's very persuasive case we, the reader, seem to be dragged along while Harris exposes the scientific community for 'copping out' and not standing up for the methods and ideals it should rightfully fight for, it is a bit of an unpleasant way for the text to end, but perhaps also legitimate defense of his stance - ugly, but necessary I suppose.

Or more importantly, what does Sam Harris mean by ""better"" in this context?I'm not saying that there are no differences, I'm asking how do we determine whether Harris' premise is correct? How do we know whether someone else's life is ""better"" than our own? For example, suppose I could measure in some way the quotient of my life and it comes to a. I think Sam Harris is saying that in principle there is someone who's quotient is >a. He isn't saying we have to be able to identify that person, or know who they are or how they lived their life. He is asking us to accept that in principle this person does exist or has existed.Well, in that case I'm not sure I can accept the premise. I don't think that it is possible for a person to know that a better life exists. I am able to observe that my neighbour has had and is having a very different life than mine, but by what metric is it possible for me to know that it is ""better"" than mine? The impossibility of answering this question tells me that it is not safe to agree with Harris' premise.Suppose, though, that isn't what Harris meant by ""better"". Suppose that he doesn't mean better for me as an individual, he means better for society. It's not about whether painting flowers or raising children is more fun for the individual it's about which of those is better for society.In which case raising children is clearly better because the one thing the world needs right now is more people, right? Or what about one guy who empties rubbish bins for a living while some other guy does heart transplant operations. Which one of them is ""better"" for society? The question is unanswerable, and therefore the premise cannot be accepted.I think at that point Sam Harris would say that heart transplant surgery versus emptying rubbish bins is not a moral choice reflective of the real world. There is no administrator of some city health care budget debating whether to hire a heart transplant surgeon or lay off five dustbin men. He's talking about moral choices we have in the real world not artificial constructs designed to miss the point.In which case, if Sam Harris is talking about better morally for society then I reply that since morality is not universal I again am unable to accept his premise. Since one man's moral imperative is another man's abhorrent abomination by what standard is he measuring ""morally better"" for society as a whole? The premise cannot be accepted. And since we cannot accept the premise we don't have to bother reading the book based on it.There are no spelling mistakes in it, though."
42,1439171211,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5920051-jeremy,1,"The book is essentially a combination of soft targets and old news. The Taliban aren't an ideal moral society! Who knew? Fulfillment is to be preferred to abject misery? What revolutionary advice! Refuting religious fundamentalism and some extreme-left versions of prescriptive cultural relativism, while valid enough, is also vapid and easy work, beyond the fact that it's merely rehashing work that Harris has done better elsewhere. What is genuinely worse, however, is that Harris seems to think that religious fundamentalism and prescriptive relativism represent the only two viable alternatives to his utilitarianism-with-an-fMRI plugged into it. It's worse still that he doesn't even feel like Bentham and Mill, from whom these ideas originate, are even worthy of meaningful discussion in his book.As has been noted everywhere, Harris' attempt to conduct this end-run around the philosophical literature that he is, consciously or not, merely restating is childish, lazy, and irritating. All that he has ultimately done in his book has been to redefine consequentialist philosophy as science and then to suggest that science, and not philosophy, is what should determine human values. It's both internally incoherent as an argument and a disingenuous shock ploy to sell copies. In defending the book, Harris claims to have addressed all of these criticisms in The Moral Landscape itself. If by ""addressing,"" we mean either indicating that he does not understand them and/or perfunctorily dismissing them (as is the case with Jonathan Haidt, whose points Harris talks straight past, among others), then surely he has. If he feels that he has competently refuted the backbreaking weight of what he is up against, then he seems alone in that belief.Any competent introduction to moral philosophy (James Rachels is a good place to start) will be much more worth your time. If you're concerned about missing out on all the science that Harris brings to bear on the topic (spoiler alert!), don't waste your time. There's passing reference to some psychology and Harris' graduate work with an fMRI. None of it is essential to his argument. The ""science"" in Harris' subtitle essentially translates to ""anything about nature that can be known in principle."" It's hard to imagine applying for a grant to fund that."
43,1439171211,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20051503-kunal-sen,5,"This is another book that I feel lucky to have found. The book argues why morality can and should be treated as a scientifically understandable phenomenon, rather than keeping it forever shrouded under religious doctrines or imagining it as a mysterious property of another mysterious entity called the soul. It does not claim the task will be easy, or that we will ever have a perfect theory of morality that can explain or predict all of our moral choices. However, it explains why we should still pursue the course of trying to understand it as a scientific fact, which can be understood in terms of our brain and our biological evolution.There is a very important and essential distinction between a question having an answer in principle, and actually being able to get a specific answer. For example, consider the question “how many people on this planet touched their head in the last one minute?” It is an impossibly difficult question to answer in practice, but there is no doubt the question has a precise numerical answer. While we can never determine that number, it is conceivable to perform a sample study on a small group of people and extend that to come up with an estimate. This estimated number is almost certainly going to be “wrong”, and not going to match the actual answer, but it will be less wrong than say “1” or “6 billion”. To find out if a question can be explored scientifically, we just need to make sure that an answer exists in principle, and not get bogged down by the difficulty of actually getting an answer. Also, in order to claim that we have made scientific progress in answering the question we do not need to narrow it down to a precise answer, but if we can just restrict it to a range of answers that is better than what we could do randomly, then we have already made scientific progress.When confronted with difficult questions like morality or values, we should not feel dejected because the process seems too difficult, or because we cannot get an exact answer. In this book the author convincingly argues that it is possible to treat any moral question as a universal and scientific issue. The book also argues why, neither religion nor some idea of Elan Vital can successfully explain the phenomenon of morality."
44,1439171211,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30924713-kramer-thompson,1,"This book is bad. I don't mind Sam Harris in general, but this book is basically worthless. I won't go into all the details here because other reviewers have done so, but I've got three main complaints. Firstly, Harris ignores, strawmans, or misunderstands every philosophical position he considers or even mentions, yet he clearly thinks that he is a philosophical genius who is grasping something that is plainly obvious but somehow slipped under the noses of all these philosophers. That's definitely not happening. Sam's philosophical ""argument"" is awful; he just asserts that morality = wellbeing maximisation. Wow, amazing. Even if we accept this ""argument"", what's science got to do with it? Science can tell us how to maximise wellbeing, but it doesn't determine that morality = wellbeing. Morality = wellbeing because Sam says so. But who cares if Science can tell us how to increase wellbeing? Wouldn't anyone accept that? Touching a hot stove decreases wellbeing, drinking water regularly increases it. Again, amazing.Secondly, the book's structure was an absolute mess. Sam was introducing the book up until at least page 67 (more than a quarter of the book's length) and possibly even further than that. Why don't you stop telling me what you're going to tell me, and just tell me? Additionally, it wasn't clear at all what the latter half of the book has to do with determining values. Sam was just talking about beliefs and how religious people's beliefs interfere with their scientific abilities. Ok, and? I admit that this section was less disastrous than the first half of the book, but it wasn't particularly interesting either.And that's my third complaint. The book was pretty boring. For the most part Sam just discussed the most popular of the pop science topics, which can be found in basically any pop science book.Overall, I knew going into it that Sam's attempt to demonstrate science's determination of values would fail, but I didn't know it would fail this badly. It might have been worth reading just so that I know exactly how bad his argument is."
45,1439171211,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34442147-nuno-r,5,"This book seems to mess with what, for some, was a beneficial pact of non-agression: science deals with facts, religions deal with values. And this fracture came to be on the assumption that facts and values are entities of very distinct nature. For many people both the compatibility of science and religion and the mere tolerance (without compatibility) rests in that everyone agrees on what fields science and religion are suposed to cover. Sam Harris thoroughly argues on every point made against science evaluating well being, and deciding matters of right and wrong on human experience. He makes his case against moral relativism, with a strong voice, and a lucid view of what's at stake. His vision is provocative, humanist, bright. His writting is clear and rich and part of what makes this and his other books so powerful. Something important for his critics, and he has gathered many, in both sides of the trench (religious people who think that science has nothing to say about [what] morality [should be] and secularists who, give or take a little bit, think pretty much the same). The title of this book is ""The Moral Landscape"". The idea, that Harris gets back to many times, is that the peaks of human flourishing may be thousands, hundreads of thousands. The ways in which humans and human societies thrive and produce hapiness and well being may be many and all equally desirable. If we were to represent it in a landscape, we would have thousands of peaks and many thousands of valeys. Sam Harris is saying that there are many ways to be right about how to make a society flourish. And many wrong ways to do it. That is the whole premise, the title of the book. Some, who have not read it or bother to understand it, may be inclined to dismiss this, just because there is no acceptance of what Sam Harris proposes: science can help determine how to get to a peak of human flourishing, how to escape from a valey, a low."
46,1439171211,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1652278-susan,4,"I liked this one even though I think I'd really have to read it again to follow all of the scientific arguments he makes. Harris' thesis is that, contrary of a popular belief, morality can and does exist in the absence of adherence to a religion and, in fact, perhaps as a side benefit, one avoids outdated moral pronouncements (like maybe ""women should keep quiet in the churches"" as well as injunctions to kill nonbelievers). Harris is a neuroscientists and wants to put forward the nation that science has much to contribute to morality. I don't disagree with that at all, but I have to say that the functional MRI studies he sites (and which he seems to be involved in conducting) were the least interesting material in this book.I suppose I am somewhere between atheist and agnostic these days, and while I appreciate many of the arguments against religion made by Dawkins and Harris and Hitchens (I haven't read the latter's book but there's some of his argument in Hitch 22), I'm most interested in facilitating an environment where one can talk about religion in something other than hushed tones and where current opinion doesn't force one to take seriously anything anyone says in the name of religion. It may be wise in many circumstances to abjure discussion of religion and politics, still with politics most of us feel pretty free expressing our opinions. I may have turned off the TV this morning when Christiane Amanpour was interviewing four new tea party Congress men and women, but I don't hesitate to disagree loudly and publicly and I don't fear the PC police telling me I can't disparage their politics."
47,1439171211,http://goodreads.com/user/show/937966-mark,4,"You know what you are going to get with Sam Harris, a member of the so-called ""new atheist"" movement (a name he shuns). Harris' writings are direct, to the point, and based upon a clear use of critical analysis. What I like about Harris' book the most is that it breaks the illusionary lines between morality, the individual, the society, and science. While Harris is not the first to broach the subject of applying critical analysis to ethics, I would argue that he has done so in the most clear and concise way yet, here.His reliance upon his background in neuroscience is the basis for his argument and his conclusion that well-being is the ultimate goal of all sentient creatures is Aristotelian. While utility does plays a role in his writings (via his views upon religion), I would argue that it is ethical virtue that is at its foundation. Harris spends a bit of time on the nature of belief from the perspective of science that does a fine job of explaining why so many people have relied wrongly upon religious belief for their moral compass. On that note, his books points out possible problems of having those who do not view ethics from a scientific view by exemplifying Francis Collins, the head of the NIH and author of ""The Language of God: A Scientist Presents Evidence for Belief"". His point is well-taken.The Moral Landscape offers the reader an ethical option that makes sense, is not ethically relative, and further points out the dangers of religion to such an important topic.This is a very readable book and is fully referenced with copious notes that will lead the reader to further material."
48,1439171211,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4077739-anthony,5,"Sam Harris has written a simple, yet extraordinarily powerful book about the ""science of morality"" and it is quite a revelation. He cuts through the cloudy thinking of religion and relativism to get at the heart of the problem: How do we as human beings maximize our well being? He shows how certain points of view should necessarily be ignored on specific topics like morality. He doesn't argue there is one right way to be moral, to live the good life, but that there are obvious, self evident wrong ways. He also shows how neuroscience and a growing understanding of our psychology and biology are breaking new ground in the study of how we think about facts and values, and how our brains see little to no difference between these areas. Needless to say, this goes against prevailing ""common sense"", which is one more thing Harris lays bare as not nearly as reliable as we might like to think. Harris provides no hard and fast answers, he is attempting to lay the foundations here. He is not, like Moses, stumbling off Mt. Sinai with stone tablets emblazoned with the ""truth,"" he is merely sketching out how we might orient ourselves to best tackle the mountain without hoping some higher power will do the work, the thinking, for us. Refreshing and brilliant."
49,1439171211,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2198250-nikki,3,"Harris tries to prove with this book that science should be the determining factor when it comes to making moral decisions. He claims that science is the only way we can live a truly moral life. He uses the concept of ""well-being"" as his ruler for evaluating morality. I found his ideas to be very interesting. His discussion of free will was quite thought-provoking. For most of the book I found him to be fair in his criticism of people of faith as well as people of science (who espouse moral relativism). However, his true color comes out towards the end of the book when discussing religion--he believes that religious people are psychologically disturbed (p. 157 in my edition).In trying to judge this book based on Harris' own premise, I kept expecting him to show me evidence of HOW science will make these moral decisions for us, but I never saw that. I think he views science as the perfect, flawless solution, but apparently he is unaware of just how many differing views there are AMONG SCIENTISTS! Choose any field (evolution, archaeology, paleontology, even math) and you will be astounded by the number of differing opinions.I appreciated many of his ideas but I remain unconvinced."
50,1439171211,http://goodreads.com/user/show/794774-diana,3,"i thought this book intended to state that science can inform human well-being and moral questions, but it was hard to see that through the author's bias against religion. his argument would be stronger if it didn't get clouded up by his efforts to prove how stupid everyone else is, particularly religious people - he hides behind his skill at belittling other people's beliefs. he spends more time arguing ""against"" than arguing ""for"" anything. i finished the book wondering 'but how CAN science determine human values?' i'd say the low of the book was when he stated that he tried to persuade a friend with rational arguments via email to not commit suicide. when his friend did kill himself 4 years later, he was left with questions such as 'what did the word depression mean to him' 'are there other remedies to depression that we don't know about'. i wonder if a loving community responding in person to his friend might have been more effective than rational emails. despite all my negative responses here, i do think this book has value and i'm glad to have read it, but i think my take away will be a few anecdotes and that this author really hates religion."
51,1439171211,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3660911-augusts-bautra,5,"Is it hyped? Sure! But is it good, as good as they say? Absolutely! A must read no doubt.Harris takes a breath and delivers a groundbreaking new perspective in the field of ethics by focusing on ""wellbeing"", a universal, albeit at this point in time, still murky underlying principle of moral actions. Then he establishes his second premise - that everything, that could possibly matter as far as wellbeing is concerned, is expressed through mental states in purely material human brain. And this is where science comes in, as the most reliable tool humanity has in studying reality. We, Harris argues, are obliged to turn the gaze of scientific mind to human values and decisions of right and wrong, so that we can map out the moral landscape and traverse it to a more compassionate, collaborative and flourishing peak.Filled with abundant insight in human cognition and it's relevance to our perception and thinking about what matters to us, The Moral Landscape provides a substantial addition to the collection of our knowledge about ourselves and the future of mankind."
52,1439171211,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4629416-betsy,3,"Somewhat disappointing. Seemed rather disjointed to me. Too much diatribe against religion and not enough real description of how science could provide evidence for moral values. Digression on freewill also lost me, but it wasn't too long. This book is more just a call to possible action than a framework for that action. [3/22/2012]"
53,1439171211,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15394822-bukk,4,"Like Richard Dawkins, ""I was one of those who had unthinkingly bought into the hectoring myth that science can say nothing about morals."" I think everyone falls into that camp at first. I did overcome this idea a while ago, after reflecting on how the more we learn about psychology and even the sentience of other animals the more we see that ideas we once thought to be outside the realm of objective knowledge, or questions we thought unanswerable, were precisely not as we thought of them. There are many things in fact that science can inform us on, and has, that previously we thought belonged to the study of philosophy or something else. And I think morality and ethics are included among these things. Moral relativism has always had a bit of a disgusting stink to it, much like the other fashionable ideas floating around in vogue circles. Sam Harris seems to not only recognize this, but to be one of the few scientists with enough intellectual honesty and disregard for fashion to address it head on.But Harris tackles this topic much more comprehensively and interestingly than I ever thought possible, and makes a hugely compelling case that so far stands up to even the strongest scrutiny. He delivers a powerful, logically sound, reasoned assessment of morality and makes a good case for a scientific basis for it, with such clear thinking that by the end of his work, it becomes evident that anyone who doubts that future discoveries in neuroscience and psychology could ever lead to a scientific and rational approach to morality sits on the same level as those who would argue that health cannot be approached scientifically. The entire medical industry stands in stark defiance of this bizarre notion. The afterward sees Sam addressing his critics, which is something everyone in the business of developing and spreading ideas should do. He effectively refutes some of the biggest criticisms of his work.I don't always agree with Sam Harris, though my disagreements with him are rare and often pedantic, but I find him to be one of the most important public intellectuals today, for a number of reasons. His thinking is ahead of its time, proposing consistent and intelligent ideas that future generations will look back at, and say, ""You mean to tell me there were people alive back then who honestly thought otherwise? People found these ideas hard to accept?"" And they will laugh that our fashions, our glazed over collective stupidity, our tribalism, our taboos, our superstitions, our insecurities were the primary reasons of disagreement with Sam Harris's good ideas, and rarely, if ever, were sound reasoning and logic the cause for disagreement. Sadly, even scientists have fallen into pitiful holes of sentiment and irrationality when trying to refute Sam's theses.Sam receives a hell of a lot of flack and shit from other intellectuals and pseudointellectuals, and this seems to be caused by something that Sam cannot fix: He tends to approach ideas rationally and objectively, while virtually all of his detractors (sadly, even those with scientific credentials) are in some form limited and severely affected by emotion, attachment to comfortable notions, and tend to think with a flair of subjective populace-pleasing in their rhetoric. Sam rises above this every time, and he unfortunately pays the price for it in a society that can't quite accept bluntness and honesty. This wouldn't be the case if many of his ideas didn't fly in the face of habits and ideological phantasms that our societies have stubbornly refused to let die. Strong ideas that move us forward are rarely comfortable and are never easy. I see Harris as one of the few people alive contributing to the public discourse with these kinds of ideas.Edit: I've amended this review to include more concrete examples of what Sam discusses, as encouraged in the comments below.What Sam's proposing isn't that science currently has all the answers to moral questions, or that it ever will have all the answers, which the subtitle of his book seems to suggest. He isn't saying, ""Here is the science that shows us which morality is right."" He's saying, ""Moral questions will, in time, be able to be scrutinized scientifically instead of merely philosophically, with a more objective treatment than the relativistic way we look at them now,"" because science will allow us to develop a better understanding of how different behaviors and actions result in positive or negative outcomes, in terms of conscious experience. The metric he proposes to measure this is human and animal well-being. An obvious response to this idea is that there doesn't seem to be a universally easy and clear way to define well-being, which makes this kind of metric useless. But by the same token, there is no clear and universal way to evaluate what health means, but this doesn't stop an entire scientific industry being devoted to it and understanding it, and it doesn't stop most people from realizing health is important, or that there are objectively right and wrong answers in how to maximize one's health. In the ways we understand health as a spectrum of bad to good, despite having definitive answers as to what exactly always constitutes good health vs bad health, we can also understand well-being, with some states objectively better than others: Living comfortably and content and having all your needs accounted for, not feeling any emotional or physical pain, no suffering, VS. Living in constant fear, constant pain, experiencing frequent loss, etc.. These are two extremes along a spectrum, but they can objectively be understood to differ in value. The basic principle behind Sam's idea is that with advancements in neuroscience, physiology, and psychology, and with better understandings of how measurable brain activity corresponds to human feeling, or emotion, we can first of all develop a more objective and measurable basis for well-being, and can then find out what actions or conditions allow humans to reach the higher levels of this spectrum. This entails eliminating the intellectual crutch of cultural context and moral relativism in trying to justify how actions that are obviously at odds with human or animal well-being can be moral, because the most basic facts about human (and all about animal) flourishing transcend culture. So, he uses various examples throughout the book to support the assertions he makes. He states that once we think about morality in terms of well-being, it becomes easy to discern a moral hierarchy across human societies. He uses the Dobu islanders as an example to illustrate a group toward the bottom of this hierarchy, as they are a deeply violent culture, with jealousy, superstition, widespready distrust, ""sorcery"", and greed running rampant through their society, without any minimization by social institutions. Their beliefs in superstitions and magic often result in death and suffering, while even the act of someone dying in their society can result in that person's closest relatives being blamed as magical accomplices in that person's death, which leads to further violence. Everyone fears everyone else, because trust is non-existent, and cooperation even seems to be minimal and based only on fear of pain or curse. They believe that spells can be purchased and traded, and that certain magical people among them hold all control of illness and resources.It must be objectively stated that the Dobu have patently false beliefs about reality, about science, about medicine. But a moral relativist would argue that they can't possibly have wrong beliefs about morality. And some would even argue that despite all these massive cultural differences, the Dobu must still love one another and have compassion for one another just like we do. But the reality of the matter is that love, compassion, trust, and other states of the human mind have distinct neurophysiology, which we are getting better and better grips on with advancements in science, that will allow us to show that, objectively, the Dobu do not likely possess the same well-being as people in other societies. And this fact will be due to their position on the moral hierarchy. The idea of moral science isn't to say that there is always a single right answer to a moral question, or even that we will ever be capable of knowing every possible answer to a moral question. A more fundamental principle in Sam's thesis is that all questions of ""good"" and ""evil"" boil down to the possibility of experiencing values like happiness, suffering, despair, etc... So saying an act is morally necessary, evil, or blameless, is to make claims about its consequences in the lives of conscious creatures. And that even within religion, consequences and conscious states are the foundation of all values. He uses a Muslim suicide bomber as an example to illustrate this, as someone who most might think is not following this mode of consequentialist thinking when committing an immoral act. But in fact, he is thinking this way, because the consequences of his actions, real and imaginary, are the entire point. He assumes he will secure a place for himself in Paradise, and for seventy of his closest relatives. Although it can easily be argued his morals are flawed and his thinking is flawed, what he believes is a moral act is based upon his understanding of consequence and experience. Here is some reasoning he uses when discussing whether or not we could ever be ""right"" about what is right and wrong. Joshua Greene, who has done neuroimaging research on morality, says that there is nothing that could make a moral claim true or false. Harris disagrees and says:Moral view A is truer than moral view B if A entails a more accurate understanding of the connections between human thoughts/intentions/behavior and human well-being. Does forcing women and girls to wear burqas make a net positive contribution to human well-being? Does it produce happier boys and girls? Does it produce more compassionate men or more contented women? Does it make for better relationships between men and women, between boys and their mothers, or between girls and their fathers? These are questions that could be answered, particularly with the help of science."
54,1439171211,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1334545-david-s-t,2,"I've read several books from the so called 'new atheists'. I've found that on books concerning religious matters, I mostly hate their books. Its not that I even care that they're atheist or not, I'm all for reading atheist arguments. I recently read Sagan's agnostic lecture book and loved it, but I have a problem with they way the present their material, they take the most absurd extreme examples of religion and throw them out as the norm. Most of these examples would infuriate the vast majority of religious people, I often feel that their arguments are more polemics and anti religious propaganda than actual thought out reasons of whether there is or isn't a deity. Sadly it seems the more I read their book reviews on sites like amazon, it seems that many of their followers take the same intolerant stances. With that being said, for the most part I like Dawkin's evolution books, so I figured that its worth a shot reading Harris's book on using science to determine morality. Sadly it seems the 'science' part of the book is pretty sparse and its just more of the same.I think I sort of agreed with the idea of this book before I started reading, basically that we should use science to help determine our morals and actions. I wouldn't be exclusive to science though, but if something can be tested and proved to be useful then I'm all for it. I actually don't think that religious values should be the norm for our laws, for example even though you could argue that Paul (see Romans in the bible) and orthodox Christianity are reasons for requiring marriage to be between a man and a woman, but if you remove the religious aspect of it, I think that most people with an open mind would allow gay marriage (I wonder if one day we'll look back on these things the same way we look back on racial issues). I think issues such as stem cell research or abortion should be discussed and both sides presented. I also think we're getting overpopulated and so I'm all for things like using condoms for birth control.My first surprise with this book is just how sparse the references to scientific studies are, I guess at this time there just aren't that many or Harris didn't want to mention them because it might quickly outdate his book. There are a few studies mentioned every now and then, but for the most part its more of him trying to show how religion is a bad way to determine morality, how there can be objective morality and that science can reach it (although few examples of what he means). For the most part I was okay with this, I didn't agree with everything he presented and don't think that some issues aren't easy to agree on, but I didn't hate the book up to this point.Then came the chapter on religion which basically made me want to put the book down (had this been earlier in the book, I would have stopped reading, but by then I was already too committed to stop). Harris didn't grow up religious and I think he fails just to understand what its like for a believer to believe. Take for example, at one part of the book he mocks belief in Jesus, one of his comments mocks the idea that Jesus can hear a billion prayers at once. Logically if Jesus was only a man then this is a pretty good argument. Now regardless of what you actually believe, pretend you're a christian who believes that all things were created through Jesus (meaning that a billion billion galaxies were created by him, see John 1:1-3), then its not hard to see why a Christian would have no problem believing that Jesus could hear a billion prayers at once, its relatively a simple task compared to creating the universe. Obviously mocking someone for accepting prayer to a being like this is pretty absurd. Of course if you believe that Jesus was just a man then he couldn't hear just one prayer let alone billions. Later he comes to a rant against Francis Collins, the person appointed by Obama as the director of the National Institutes of Health. Basically, he's pissed that Collins, someone that hold religious convictions is appointed to such a high position, and he basis this on religious grounds. He admits that Collins holds the same position as him on issues like evolution or stem cell research, but he can't stand the fact that Collins prayed before taking this position. Now here is my point, I hope that one day we can get to a point of racial, ethnic and religious tolerance for all people. For example a place where the next president candidate is elected on his views and past voting precedent and not on something like his religious stance. I think it is wrong that if someone is an open atheist/agnostic, he doesn't stand a chance of being the president regardless of his credentials. I'm not sure Harris would agrees on the opposite, I think if he had his way only atheists would be qualified. Take Collins, Harris seems to attack someone whom does seem to be qualified for the position almost solely on his religious beliefs. Harris's comments about Collins seems to have pissed off some fellow atheists, and Harris goes on to reprint their letters / newspaper columns. These remarks from the others seem logical to me (more so than the majority of the book), they think Harris should back down, not attack someone based on Christianity, that Harris and the new atheists are doing more harm than good on issues like evolution (I've seen this first hand where someone will deny evolution because it makes you an atheist like Dawkins). Harris ignores this because truthfully his goal isn't getting things like modern science / evolution accepted but its to remove religion. Which brings me to my final point, who is the audience of this book? Harris seems to try to piss everyone off, religious, philosophers, and fellow scientists. It seems the audience is the very limited to his new atheist followers. This is the biggest problem with the book, if you want to see change happen you have to convince a much broader audience, we live in a democracy and a majority of the population does still believe in a deity and Harris tries to be elite and attack the masses and expects real change to happen, but the only thing which will happen is they'll further oppose his view. This major thing makes the book pretty pointless, Harris is just trying to convince his small (relatively) audience and no one else. With everything being said, I'm done reading these new atheist books for now, I'll get my atheist / agnostic arguments elsewhere. I don't have time to read intolerant Christian fundamentalists, I don't have time to read their atheist counterparts either. "
55,1439171211,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2425221-joshua,3,"The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly.First of all, I have to admit that I am a devout Christian and I completely disagree with the philosophy of Scientism. And although everyone reads and learns with some element of bias, I tried to read this with much of an open mind as possible. With that being said, I found a lot of good and enjoyed The Moral Landscape. I respect Harris and applaud his bravery on the topic. However, there were also many elements of his book where I thought his rationale was shaky and perhaps even contradictory. And some parts that, to me, were downright absurd. I'll discuss all these things under the topics of ""Good, bad, and ugly"".THE GOOD: While Harris and I sit rather far away on many spectrum of thought, one of the most important beliefs is one that we both share, which is the praxis of Ethics. Harris cares a lot about human suffering. He is not the type who merely ponders ethics in an ivory tower. He stresses action - and this is vital regardless of one's worldview. And while it seems that Christians and Atheists rarely play nice with each other, I'd rather go to a party with a room full of Atheistic doers than Christian thinkers. Another thing that Harris and I have in common is our beliefs in moral absolutism. Harris is bold in his moral views that typically don't fit with many that run in his circle. He unapologetically combats the views of moral relativism with articulation and vigor. I'm sure this puts poor Sam Harris in a situation where he gets heat from both sides, so I admire his convictions. I think it's sad when people determine the quality of a book based on how much of it they agreed or disagreed with. The Moral Landscape had a plethora of views and ideas that while I can respect I completely disagree with. This does not take away from the fact that it was a decently written book. He articulated his thoughts with a lot of detail and was easily understandable thanks to a lot of his analogies. He was humble enough to list plenty of argument against his finds and argued them with relative respect. Regardless of my belief, I learned a lot, as he covered a variety of tidbits in various studies like ontology, epistemology, psychology, natural science, etc. Harris did not change my mind on many things, but I am ultimately better for reading this book.THE BAD: As much as I liked this book, there were a few disappointing things. First off, the subtitle should not have been ""How Science can determine values,"" it should have been ""Why Science can determine values"". The book was 95% argument and defense and about 5% how. This was a little disappointing. And in his many, many arguments, there were a few that were very weak and even contradictory. Now, in Harris' defense, this field is still very young and he was honest enough to admit that he did not have all the answers. And I'm honest enough to say that perhaps I interpreted some of thoughts incorrectly. After all, I'm but a journeyman intellectual trying to comprehend the unique perspective of a neuroscientist. But there has been a trend among many readers that have seen the same pattern of inconsistency in his arguments. Another bad aspect - Harris, just like in his other books, couldn't suppress his inner angry Atheist. But what would a Sam Harris book be without a little vitriol against Christians? Now, as a Christian I must say that he is correct on a lot of his views regarding morality and religion. Moral absolutism, mixed with religious views can sometimes create incredibly dogmatic people that refuse to see reason because, after all, they're arguing on behalf of God. I'll be the first to admit that throughout history many Christians have been ignorant and dangerous with their ethics that are based on poor interpretations of scripture. But it's important to not throw the baby out with the bathwater. Harris tends to focus on the stupidity of a small yet vocal minority in order to discredit all aspects of faith. And while Harris mostly writes with objectivity when talking about Science, he tends to show a little more pathos and personal bias when talking about Christianity. THE UGLY: There were a few unfortunate points in the book. Harris had me respecting all of his thoughts until he stated his belief that we have no free will and are nothing but slaves to the neurons in our heads. With this belief, I felt that a lot of his views came crashing down like a house of cards. Harris tried to distinguish differences between this view and fatalism, but I feel it's incredibly hard to do this. It was this point that he should have explained more. But his arguments were absurdly shallow. Another ugly part of the book was its often feel of arrogance that is characteristic of the new Atheist movement. Harris, as well as many of his drinking buddies, tend to argue through nothing but the small lens of Methodism, play Scientism as a trump card, and intellectually write off anyone who thinks otherwise. Harris does not go as far as some like Hawking who proclaims that Philosophy is dead, but his arrogance in Scientism appears to be evident. He at one point talks about those who argue things that they have little knowledge of, such as Christian Apologists that debate Evolution. But Harris is guilty of this as well. Harris also implies the notion that Scientists are always humble and honest and objective. Bull. This ever-growing attitude that Scientism is completely impartial and unbiased and humble and all about facts is absurd and laughable. I would question anyone's rationality and/or honesty who says that the theories in Steven Hawking's new book was based on pure scientific observation without an iota of his strong belief that God doesn't exist. With all that being said, I am glad I read the Moral Landscape. Again, regardless of my extremely opposing views, the most important take away from this book is a call to moral action that ends human suffering. And while my particularism views majorly clash with Harris, I do believe that Science should play a role in ethics. Science can give some incredibly valuable information on the subject - it just can't be the only thing determining it. "
56,1439171211,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13369978-jana-light,3,"On the face of it, I am the perfect, most receptive audience for this book. I love Harris's podcast (his guests and conversations are fascinating) and I already think that we should look to science to help us figure out what ""good"" means for human beings as we tackle tough ethical questions. I was pretty disappointed in the final product, unfortunately. Most importantly of my criticisms is that Harris claims far too quickly that his science-based morality overcomes the ""is/ought"" problem. It doesn't. It can't. Claiming that science does overcome this foundational-to-ethics problem makes him overreach on his general conclusion that science can and should determine ethical norms. If he instead had said that science can and should inform our ethical norms, I would be all on board. Even though I think he overreached with his conclusion, there is still a LOT of good stuff to consider and take seriously in this book for anyone thinking through the thorny issues of how to discover and construct the ethical norms that best allow us to navigate this difficult, complicated thing called relational living, with as much good and as little harm as possible."
57,1439171211,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73614068-tuomas-auvinen,1,"The basic idea of this book is interesting and compelling. However, the analysis is, with the exception of the parts on brain studies and neuroscience, superficial and lacks proper definitions of the very thing that, for Harris, constitutes the ultimate measure of moral: well-being and human flourishing. He side steps this trap with numerous low hanging fruits and with the classic “the fact that we don’t have a final understanding of something doesn’t mean it doesn’t exist” -argument. Right, you could say this of almost anything we don’t know. Furthermore, when Harris fails to institute a logically coherent and empirically proved “science of morality and ethics”, he continues his crusade against his nemesis, that is religion(s), especially Christianity and Islam, by discussing how religion definitely is not the place where good morals and ethics are found. This he does with the largest collection of straw men known to man."
58,1439171211,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67699918-will,4,"INTRODUCTION-Morals/Values like Food Analogy: There is not 1 best food to eat but there are still ""good"" foods and ""bad foods"" (poison for instance). There are also exceptions for individual circumstances like allergies that could kill one person but be healthy for another which can be studied by science via chemistry, biology, etc. Because we can examine how food effects our well being, we do not say that all food is on equal foundation or equally good or that all cultures foods are equal in health (American vs Asian for instance).-""As with all matters of fact, differences of opinion on moral questions merely reveal the incompleteness of our knowledge; they do not oblige us to respect a diversity of views indefinitely.""-""While it is rarely stated this clearly, this faith in the intrinsic limits of reason is now the received opinion in intellectual circles."" (in response to the philosophies of Hume, Moore, and Popper and subsequently 'confirmed' by scientist Fodor regarding the divide between science owning the natural world, and religion owning the moral landscape.-The gap between Science and Religion is an illusion in at least 3 senses: 1) whatever can be known about maximizing the well-being of conscious creatures must at some point translate into facts about brains and their interaction with the world; 2) the very idea of 'objective' knowledge has values built into it as we must first value logical consistency, reliance on evidence, parsimony, etc in order to rely on the knowledge; and 3) beliefs about facts and beliefs about values appear to arise from similar processes in the brain - it appears that we have a common system for judging truth and falsity for 'values' and 'facts.'-A 'scientific' view of human values DOES NOT EQUAL an 'evolutionary' view of human values. As with everything else we value now (art, science, math), we do not rely on an evolutionary scope or instinctual drives for explanation or understanding. If we did, men would find sperm donations to be the highest calling as it relates to furthering the genealogy without exerting resources.-Support for a Moral Landscape only requires 2 points: 1) Some people have better lives than others and 2) these differences relate to states of the human brain and the world. This is illustrated by the Good Life and Bad Life scenario in which 1 person's life is a living hell (raped, murdered, etc) while the other is a privileged person helping the poor with a million dollar grant. Both of these scenarios exist in the world and are clearly different and due to states of the brain and world.-Promoting well-being is the ultimate positive value and is similar to physical health in many ways. For instance, it sometimes requires suffering in some form. Exercise, surgery, learning can all be painful in the short term but are clearly beneficial long term. This can be the same for human progress - technology sometimes has unintended consequences that can even result in the death of some people but that does not mean it should not be valued.-Science and Religion are in a Zero-Sum game regarding facts, values, etc. Eventually they will collide and reason is the only rational way to proceed. The secular liberals are creating a harmful discourse in which they allow science to coexist with religion which allows religious dogma to be pushed into political and social realms where it does not belong and cannot make rational decisions. This results in an undermining of the scientific community and those who support it. Right-wing conservatives are bad for pushing pro religion, but Left-wing liberals are bad for not allowing rational discourse regarding religious dogma.MORAL TRUTH: CHAPTER 1-Harris's thesis: Science can, in principle, help us understand what we should do and should want—and, therefore, what other people should do and should want in order to live the best lives possible. My claim is that there are right and wrong answers to moral questions, just as there are right and wrong answers to questions of physics, and such answers may one day fall within reach of the maturing sciences of mind.-Morality can be studied by science just as any other subject can be studied by science. Science is not some mathematical equation or meeting of hyper educated persons - it is merely the belief that evidence is required to form facts, logic should be upheld, and thought processes should be free of outside sources of information that would sway one's opinion. Because morality is essentially how the well-being of conscious creatures can be affected by the physical world (brain and actual world itself), we can study how changes in the brain and physical world affect well-being. Well-being can have many forms of good (like food or health) and does not require that there be a single answer BUT it still allows for some answers to be obviously wrong (poison, eating sugar all day every day, cutting off your leg, etc). This line of thought can be applied to 'morals' and 'values' in terms of how they affect well-being overall.-Values only exist relative to actual or potential changes in the well-being of conscious creatures.-Well-being is not perfectly defined and does not have to be in order to continue studying and improving upon it (life, death, etc. are the same way). Universal morality (change in well-being) can be identified (worst case scenario). Because we can identify an absolute worst case scenario, doing anything that is better than that scenario can be considered good. Some will be better than others and we may not know which ones, but that doesn't mean some answers can't be obviously wrong. Killing everyone you meet because it makes you feel good would not be a 'good' way to improve the well-being of those you come into contact with and is obviously a problem. The same can be said of religious practices (taliban, FGM, genocide, etc).-Culture (millions of people doing the same thing) somehow provides a get out of jail free card to those who perform despicable acts of human cruelty (female genital mutilation). Imagine if a single person were to attempt to perform this and how pissed off the world would be, clamoring to have them put away or killed. But because it is happening within an entire 'culture' it is somehow deemed to be acceptable (the fact that it is based on religious precepts gives it further invincibility from scrutiny).-Three separate projects that should not be confused: 1) Explain why people follow certain patterns of thought and behavior, 2) Determine which patterns of thought and behavior we should follow, and 3) Convince those who are having harmful patterns of thought to reject them and start living based on behavior we believe they should follow.GOOD AND EVIL: CHAPTER 2-Human cooperation and interaction is probably the most important piece of the well-being of humanity and is governed by 'ethics/morality.'-The human brain is sometimes not capable of doing morale arithmetic and requires that laws and institutions help to bridge the gap (valuing 1 persons misery over the misery of thousands, your kid vs 10 other kids, etc). This does not mean morals cannot be Right or Wrong, but merely that there is not a perfect scenario that we understand yet. We can still determine whether or not the action will make things better or worse and choose based on that distinction.-""No human being stands as author to his own genes or his upbringing, and yet we have every reason to believe that these factors determine his character throughout life. Our system of justice should reflect our understanding that each of us could have been dealt a very different hand in life. In fact, it seems immoral not to recognize just how much luck is involved in morality itself.""-Free will is an illusion - we are not a separate entity from our brain but merely the collection of thoughts and physical/chemical reactions taking place within the biological constraint of our brain. Thoughts merely arise, they are not directed by 'us.' This makes the justice system seem particularly odd when you consider that intent is of major concern in court proceedings. Environment as a driving force in the lives of people is becoming more and more apparent as science grows and has huge implications on all aspects of humanity.BELIEF: CHAPTER 3-Belief is the act of coming to the understanding of a situation, fact, etc. with no prior knowledge or reason to think otherwise.-""The answer to the question “What should I believe, and why should I believe it?” is generally a scientific one. Believe a proposition because it is well supported by theory and evidence; believe it because it has been experimentally verified; believe it because a generation of smart people have tried their best to falsify it and failed; believe it because it is true (or seems so). This is a norm of cognition as well as the core of any scientific mission statement. As far as our under standing of the world is concerned— there are no facts without values.""RELIGION: CHAPTER 4-Case studies of various countries and their overall well-being prove that religion does not drive societal success and the lack of religion certainly does not spell the doom of society either. One need only look at Norway, Netherlands, Denmark, etc.-Neuroimaging of individuals being presented religious claims and standard fact claims shows the the brain processes belief (whether it be value driven or standard historical or physical facts about the universe) in the same part of the brain. This lends credence to the theory that values can be assessed by science the same way the facts about the physical universe can be.-Beliefs have consequences which is why religion (or any other irrational thought process) can be so dangerous.-Neurological studies continue to support the idea that the mind (and 'soul') is not separate from the brain and therefor does not even exist as the 'duality' our common sense seems to tell us.-Random thought: If babies, children, etc go to heaven when they die (if saved, etc), what form do they take while they are there? Do they forever remain a child body with a child mind? Does everyone have infinite knowledge? If so, how does one determine that you're even the same individual?-Many religious people tend to denigrate science whenever asked about origins of the universe, biological history of man, the theory of evolution (anything that pokes glaring holes in their religious beliefs); but they tend to accept and even partake in the scientific advances from every other facet: antibiotics and advances in healthcare, methods of killing other humans via weapons and war devices, transportation, electricity, even pseudoscience that purports to backup their claims of the earth being 6k years old by a handful of 'scientists' while the larger community clearly stands opposed. It is fairly obvious they are picking and choosing specific portions to believe and others to ignore in order to suit their current worldview rather than being open to interpret any and all evidence presented to them.-""One wonders if the author has ever read a newspaper. The behavior of humans offers no such “dramatic contrast”? How badly must human beings behave to put this “sense of universal rightness” in doubt? While no other species can match us for altruism, none can match us for sadistic cruelty either. And just how widespread must “glimmerings” of morality be among other animals before Collins—who, after all, knows a thing or two about genes—begins to wonder whether our moral sense has evolutionary precursors? What if mice show greater distress at the suffering of familiar mice than unfamiliar ones? (They do. 88 ) What if monkeys will starve themselves to prevent their cage mates from receiving painful shocks? (They will. 89 ) What if chimps have a demonstrable sense of fairness when receiving food rewards? (They have. 90 ) What if dogs do too? (Ditto. 91 ) Wouldn’t these be precisely the sorts of findings one would expect if our morality were the product of evolution?""-Human stem cell research requires the destruction of a 150 cell human embryo and is considered to be a heinous act of violence by the religious community. Yet, they allow for the destruction of siamese twins and twins that appear as a fetus within a fetus which are far more developed than 150 cells. The same can be said of houseflies, people from other other cultures that we continually assail, prisoners, etc. Not to mention that bombing others does not present the potential upside that stem cell research does in terms of medical discoveries to alleviate human suffering.THE FUTURE OF HAPPINESS: CHAPTER 5-We, humans, are not particularly good at determining what will make us happy whether it be in the past, present, or future. This causes us to have a difficult time pursuing things that will make us happy long term and requires some sort of solution to determine rather than 'common sense.'-We have both a 'remembering self' and an 'experiencing self' that seem to feel different levels of contentment surrounding the same time frames and experiences, only told from a different frame of mind. They are both part of the same underlying current of memories, but told from varying perspectives.-If Harris's theory is correct (science can help to determine which values are more conducive to the well-being of humans), than there is hope for the future. If not, than the status quo will probably be maintained as we stumble through the dark trying to make things better without a proper tool to understand our progress."
