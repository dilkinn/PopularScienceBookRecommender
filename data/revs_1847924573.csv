No one understands what the theory means. And as Philip Ball says, “No one tells you that it often lacks any justification beyond the mere (and obviously important) fact that it works.” And this has a startling implication: It’s not just the physical world that is different from what we thought; reason itself must be something much more obscure than we have ever conceived. Both the scientific route to quantum theory and the meaning of that theory contradict our most dearly held principles of correct thinking, or for that matter our most deeply engrained image of ourselves.Ball takes an intriguing perspective. Most commentators on quantum physics, possibly most scientists, consider its contradictions - entanglement, wave/particle ambiguity, simultaneous existence and non-existence, etc. - as indications that the theory is incomplete, that some further theoretical breakthrough will resolve these contradictions and make it more rational. Ball doesn’t do that. Suppose, he suggests, “the apparent oddness, the paradoxes and puzzles of quantum mechanics, are real.” What we are then confronted with is a challenge to think differently because the world demands that we do so.If reality is as quantum physics says it is, we don’t need a better physics, we need to reconsider what we mean when we use words like ‘reasonable’, and ‘rational’, and ‘logical’, and even ‘knowing’. If reality is as quantum physics says it is, we need to re-learn what it means to learn - not just about physics but about everything. If reality is as quantum physics says it is, the real issue isn’t about matter and energy but about mind. We may know far less than we thought we knew about what constitutes this dominant human capacity for making sense of the world because what it means to make sense doesn’t anymore. Quantum physics “calls into question the meanings and limits of space and time, cause and effect, and knowledge itself.”Ball’s thesis is that quantum theory isn’t even about physics, it’s about information: “We now realise that quantum mechanics is less about particles and waves, uncertainty and fuzziness, than a theory about information: about what can be known and how.” In other words quantum theory is the key to an entirely new epistemology, an unexpected kind of ‘knowability’. As a species, we have stumbled across something more fundamental than another tool for exploiting the universe. We may, instead, have an impetus (or at least invitation) for beginning to investigate and understand ourselves in a new way.This is clearly exciting stuff. When Ball points out that quantum theory “is not so much a theory that one can test by observation and measurement, but a theory about what it means to observe and measure,” he is implying that it is a theory of being human, a cosmic anthropology perhaps. After all, isn’t that what we spend most of our lives as human beings doing? Observing, comparatively assessing, and judging everything? If quantum theory is a theory of those things, it is a theory of us. It is certainly not a fully worked out theory but it does give a clear direction which is rather different than any other ever proposed.For example, a central issue of quantum theory is measurement. Essentially, measurement is not a neutral act; it changes the character of the thing measured in some annoying ways. There is no such thing as ‘unobtrusive measurement’ in quantum physics. This challenges the idea of measurement as something which observes and comparatively assesses the properties of an object. The results of experimentation show that this is not the case. Measurement is not the assessment of the inherent properties of an object, it is the assignment of an object as a property of a scale of measurement, a metric.* This is the case as much in the ‘macro’ world we inhabit as it is in that of atomic particles. We just haven’t needed to recognise the fact.So, this is a revelation of quantum physics: there are no inherent properties. ‘Properties’ are not inherent in anything. They are essentially scales on which we assign a place to events, objects, or relationships. As it turns out, sometimes the scales are incompatible with each other. Nothing to do with the object; everything to do with the scales. There is absolutely nothing ‘objective’ about these scales; they are chosen for some reason, some human reason, that has nothing to do with the phenomenon in question. These scales are not merely the basis for further judgment, they are themselves a judgment about what’s important in the world. That is, they are always subjective in the sense that they have a personal import to the one who chooses them.The ‘meaning’ of quantum uncertainty, therefore, is fundamentally aesthetical and ethical, even in scientific research. The choice of a metric always means the rejection of other metrics. And the positive choice is not nearly so significant as the exclusion of the myriad of other possible metrics which could have been used to assess a phenomenon. The choice even at the quantum level is not binary - position vs. momentum - it is so for any number of so-called conjugate variables; and any choice means that an infinite number of other things will not be ‘observed,’ that is assigned a place on alternative metrics. This is one interpretation of the process of ‘replication’ of quantum events. The ‘imprint’ of the event is what is left on the metric; and if it is left 0n one it cannot be left on another. The event is quite literally a property of the metric which ‘absorbs’ information making it unavailable as a property of another metric.These musings on measurement are mine not Ball’s; but I think they conform with the spirit of his analysis of quantum theory: “Rather than insisting on its difficulty, we might better regard it as a beguiling, maddening, even amusing gauntlet thrown down to challenge the imagination. For that is indeed what is challenged.” I imagine a logic which has yet to be articulated, specifically a logic of permissible choices of criteria of judgment. Such a logic would be both aesthetic and moral. It would also explicitly acknowledge that it is inevitable that we project our aesthetic and moral selves upon the world (as we do with the idea of a wave function - actually instructions for how to measure - which then allows the calculation of all sorts of ‘properties’ which are derived from these instructions). Perhaps most important is the recognition in this logic that we have a choice, and therefore a responsibility, about what we project. If we don’t know why we make certain choices, then we have a duty to find out.The applicability of such a logic is of course not confined to measurement. Measurement is one activity in the more general realm of language (which in turn is a component of information, that are all elements, perhaps the only elements, of mind). This suggests that there might be an aesthetic/moral logic of language that overrides categories like vocabulary, grammar, and pragmatics. Perhaps that is what literature is meant to do - uncover the hidden quantum logic of language one story at a time. And that logic exists, if it does at all, in mind not matter. Or if that way of expressing it is prejudicial, perhaps it would be better to say that it exists in matter as incipient mind. Matter merely awaits its turn at mind... and vice-versa. Meanwhile mind tells stories about matter, and there is nothing to compare these stories with... except other stories. Matter, of course, remains mute on the subject and just lurks, biding its time.*See for further discussion: https://www.goodreads.com/review/show..."

Then there’s no problem: we’re back with the gloves. The trouble is that there are no hidden variables in quantum mechanics that ‘secretly’ assign definite values to variables even though they appear to acquire them randomly through the act of measurement.”In “Beyond Weird” by Philip Ball“It seems that measurement somehow does destroy quantum coherence, forcing us to speak of the wavefunction as having ‘collapsed’.”In “Beyond Weird” by Philip Ball“Decoherence is what destroys the possibility of observing macroscopic superpositions - including Schrödinger’s live/dead cat. And this has nothing to do with observation in the normal sense: we don’t need a conscious mind to ‘look’ in order to ‘collapse the wavefunction’. All we need is for the environment to disperse the quantum coherence. This happens with extraordinary efficiency - it’s probably the most efficient process known to science. And it is very clear why size matters here: there is simply more interaction with the environment, and therefore faster decoherence, for larger objects.”In “Beyond Weird” by Philip Ball"

I also enjoy sorting out my understanding of quantum physics, searching for better stories, better analogies, and just... BETTER. This book is one of the BETTER. It may not be as charming as some and I don't mind how it skimps on biographies and jumps right into the SCIENCE, but it does fall short in outright describing the math. (That may be a good thing for some. Especially if you're not in the mood to crunch math.)To be certain, this text goes beyond the everyday norm and focuses on the science. The ideas. The concerns. And it's all in the service of demystifying it all.Quantum Physics is one of those subjects that agrees on fundamental maths but invites wildly divergent theories that make a coherent STORY of our reality. You know: Copenhagen (don't go nuts on us,) Everett (multiple-worlds), String, and more.What we have in this book is not a biography of the physicists but an admirable attempt to make the famously weird (thank you Feynman!) as commonplace and normal as can be. I mean, we're human, and humans are most famous for turning all things truly fantastic into the stunningly banal. :)And this is exactly what this book tries to accomplish. Step by step, it demystifies the very small particles, removes the term spooky action, and naturalizes all things entangled.It gives time to the various big-action theories that align the quantum with the macro, and all of this is pretty good if not as good as some other books that cover these topics, but what this book does best is describe the current technology of quantum computers. It doesn't shirk the shortcomings of our descriptions or the limitations of the process. This isn't a PR job by prospective companies trying to sell you a 100k computer.BTW quantum computers ARE on the market now. Some developers are working on cheaper versions. What are they really good at? Factoring prime numbers. Thank goodness! That's great for all you hackers out there! PGP MAY need a booster soon. :)While this one doesn't always come close to the charm I'm used to in popularized physics books, I really have nothing bad to say about the contents. "
3,1847924573,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3073125-jon-ure-a,4,"Beyond whatever subject I end up being interested in from time to time, quantum mechanics, the study of the processes that lie at the bottom of reality, is the most interesting subject. If you disagree, you can physically fight me. I tend to come back to books on quantum mechanics from time to time to learn about the recent discoveries, which in a field as bizarre as this one could mean a complete reframing of reality.This is the kind of book on quantum mechanics you read after you've been hit with most of its mysteries and you have had some time to ponder them. In any case, the nonsensical results of the famous double slit experiment are a good first approximation to the subject, or to get a refresher.In the double slit experiment, you put a photon gun on one side of a table, a panel in the middle that you can slide revealing either one or two slits, and on the opposite side of the table some sort of ""wall"" of material that can capture the impression of the photons as they hit it. The experiment progressed in phases through the years:1) In a single slit configuration, you shoot a bunch of photons at once. On the wall a stripe appears where the photons hit it: the kind of impression produced when a bunch of particles go through a narrow slit behaving like microscopic bullets.2) In a two slit configuration, after shooting the photons at once, you would expect to get two stripes on the wall, a strip behind each slit, as the particles of light passed through either one slit or the other. That's not what happens. Instead you get something like this on the wall:That's an interference pattern caused by waves, which is routinely described mathematically. So are particles concrete entities, or are they waves? Both?3) In a two slit configuration, you use the photon gun so it only fires a single photon after the previous one has hit the wall. Naturally, the photon then would have to pass through one slit or the other, and the final impression on the wall would suggest a particle based nature for the photons. However, that's not what happens: you get the same interference pattern as in the previous point. But a single photon could not interfere with any other, so that must at least mean that it is interfering with itself.4) To figure out through which of the slits each photon passes, you can put special detectors. In a two slit configuration and with the photon gun shooting plenty at once, as long as there is a detector in any of the slits that doesn't otherwise interact with the photon, what you get on the wall is a particle based behavior: two stripes of impressions. The result changes depending on whether or not you choose to measure the progress midway through. That's a phenomenon unheard of in classical physics, not to mention completely illogical.5) The scientists got clever and pushed the detector further in between a slit and the wall. A photon would hit it and through the detector you would figure out if it passed through that slit or the other. However, nature would not be tricked: if you try to detect the path of a particle from its origin to the moment it hits the wall, the interference pattern disappears. That would mean that a particle that hits a detector after it passes a slit is able to go back in time or know ahead of time that its properties are going to be measured midway through, and the particle will change how it manifests.The study of quantum mechanics, even at the level of a layman, implies realizing that the most basic assumptions about reality hold up during your day to day just because that's how the world happens to manifest as at your size. But it's quantum mechanics all the way down, and at some point the following assumptions break down: that there's a history of cause and effect you can follow, that an object has a solid physical presence with defined properties, that the properties of an object will not change depending on how you look at it, that all the properties of an object will be located in that object, and not, lets say, light years away, that measuring the properties of an object repeatedly doesn't change the results or even invalidate some property, etc.The revelations of quantum mechanics strike us as illogical and contrary to common sense, but only because our instincts and intelligence are not attuned to reality as it is: we evolved to handle the world from the ground to the height of some lowest branches, and that's all we ever needed. It's so bad that even putting the behaviors discovered through quantum mechanics in words in a coherent manner is very hard, because it hits the limits of what human language is able to express.Although quantum mechanics is a field that started in the early 20th century, there's still no orthodoxy about some of its biggest mysteries: turns out that at the bottom of reality everything comes down to something called a wavefunction, a mathematical representation of the probabilities a quantum object's properties will have this or that value when measured. For example, an electron ""trapped"" in a box, when measured could have a 95 percent probability of being found inside the solid box, but a non-negligible probability of being found inside the walls of the box, or even outside of it. This phenomenon, called quantum tunneling, is used extensively in electronics to exchange electrons between its elements; around 30% of the world's economy depends on applied quantum mechanics. The controversy regarding wavefunctions comes down to two factions: one of them believes that the wavefunction relates to an underlying physical reality with a history of cause and effect, but the other position, so far backed by more evidence, says that asking what exists ""under"" the wavefunction doesn't make sense, because the properties of a quantum object manifest when measured: literally come into existence. The phenomenon of radioactivity is evidence for this position, because radioactive decay seems to be truly random.Probably my favorite quantum behavior is that of entanglement: two quantum objects can be ""interlinked"" so as to the properties of one become part of the other. If an entangled electron spins, you know that its paired electron will have spun in the opposite direction. That's how reality works. The astonishing issue is that the linked effect will happen immediately, no matter how far away one quantum object is from the other, even light years away. This happens with no apparent physical connection of any kind transmiting information between them. Obviously the phenomenon breaks the speed of light, which should be impossible. It suggests that the distances in spacetime are illusory, and that all the points are in fact connected. That's some hope for someone like me who wishes we would be able to ""move"" faster than light to other planets. However, some scientists seem to believe that in fact the effects of entanglement don't break the speed of light, because the correlation between the measurement of one of the pairs and the other, to make sure that they have changed, will always be made at the speed of light. I'm not sure if I can understand that; it seems to me that the effect would have happened anyway already, but part of quantum mechanics is that the effects don't ""pop up"" into existence until measured. So it's another head spin.Learning about behaviors like these makes many students of quantum mechanics shiver with the notion that reality is in fact a computer simulation (likely in a quantum computer). Anyone who programs complicated graphic simulations knows that only what's going to appear on the screen (therefore to be looked at) is really represented and drawn, and everything else is just variables waiting to be transformed into a representation when their turn on the stage comes. If you were to write a simulation that someone would experience, having all of the entities' properties as a range of probabilities to be spawned when someone would require that experience is likely the least resource intensive way of simulating an entire universe, because the underlying memory wouldn't have to keep precise track of anything nobody is paying attention to. That's very suspicious. So is entanglement in that case: how you would store the coordinates of the entire universe would have no relation to its physical representation, and therefore there would be no problem with manipulating linked entities at the same time.The notion that depending on how you choose to observe nature at its rawest you get different results, often even contradictory, and therefore consciousness seemed to be able to change reality, has seeped over the decades into the public perception, in nasty ways. One of the worst recent examples is an idea I won't name that seemed to become most popular amongst isolated housewives: that what the universe creates depends on your thoughts, which often means that positive thoughts result in the universe gifting you whatever you wished for (and if your kid ended up developing an aggressive cancer, you weren't positive enough). However, over the recent decades the role of consciousness has been taken out of the picture entirely, and we now understand how a quantum system becomes ""classical"". A quantum system starts ""coherent"", with all its possible states in superpositions, but through interactions with the environment, the system ""decoheres"". It's not the action of measuring, but the interaction between the macroscopic measuring devices and the coherent quantum system. Some quantum states ""blur out"" faster than others, and/or are more resistant to interference. However, you don't seem to be able to choose which of the possibilities the system's wavefunction (in this case an aggregation of wavefunctions) collapses to. The size of the elements of a quantum system does matter, because the more atoms it contains the higher the risk of a catastrophic interaction, but experiments have shown that there seems to be no limit to the size of an object to sustain it in a quantum state, as long as you isolate it from enviromental influences and cool it down ""enough"".It's important to restate this: there's no gap between the quantum world and the classical world. The classical world is the result of smudged out quantum states, and there are ways to keep them coherent perpetually, and in some cases even recover decohered states.Far from being a curiosity, this breakthrough has been used in the development of quantum computers. We are used to hearing the adjective ""quantum"" attached to any name in order for it to sound futuristic, but quantum computers are entirely based on quantum mechanics. They were first proposed, officially at least, by physicist Richard Feynman: he brought to the world's attention that the computers that were being developed were based on classical physics, which would be unable to simulate nor bring solutions to the most complicated and time consuming problems that could be turned into algorithms: to realistically simulate any physical system, it should be processed in quantum states to its smallest element, because that's how reality works, but so far our computers had only been able to produce approximations very, very distant from how the universe actually works.The average person would think that our current classical computers are fast enough. If you are a programmer and into artificial intelligence, you know that training a neural network requires from hours to days and sometimes even weeks. However, none of that comes close to the amount of time required by the most meaningful problems. Finding out new ways for proteins to fold could lead to enormous advances in medicine and biology in general, but the permutations involving realistic amounts of atoms and molecules are far too high for computers to handle. Finding entirely new materials, for example, is a process that throughout human history has been more a matter of luck than a deliberate process, and yet a quantum computer could try an insane number of permutations of realistically simulated atoms. The advances that could come in the field of artificial intelligence are unimaginable. Something as simple in theory as evolving the entire structure of a vehicle, down to the atomic level, so it adjusts through billions of iterations to the requirements wanted by a company (for example speed, stability, resistance, etc.) could be achieved in seconds.Some of the top scientists, employed by some of the most important companies, have been competing to achieve the holy grail: quantum supremacy. They defined it as the moment when an algorithm that would take a known amount of time in a supercomputer to solve would be invariably solved much faster in a quantum computer. After some hesitation, Google recently announced that they had achieved that breakthrough. The following link is for their video: Demonstrating Quantum Supremacy. The test they devised would have taken a supercomputer 10,000 years to process. The complex problems mentioned before are on those realms of intractable time. Their quantum computer spat out the correct result in little more than three minutes. It solved in three minutes a problem that would have taken 10,000 years with our previous best technology.It's very hard to predict what's going to happen from now on. A major hurdle is figuring out the quantum algorithm to describe a problem; if you can't program it in, the quantum computer can't even attempt to process it. Who knows if most problems that are handled by classical computers are going to be translatable to quantum computers, or if the quantum computers of the future will end up taking up space in our houses; after all, the quantum bits need to be isolated from their environment and cooled to near absolute zero. But remember that some of the problems that a quantum computer would be able to solve is discovering new materials.There isn't a field whose developments I follow more closely than quantum computing. For me this feels like we are jumping from the bronze age to the space age. A worrying aspect of it, of course, is that human beings, the primates with delusions of grandeur that we are, aren't known to handle breakthrough technological advances in a very rational, peaceful manner."

6,1847924573,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16212136-peter-pete-mcloughlin,5,The author seems to be close to the Copenhagen School on interpretations of QM and I really like Everettian Many Worlds. That said this is a really good book on boiling down the strangeness of Quantum Mechanics and getting our heads around it. The author makes clear a lot of physics might have hard math and quantum mechanics is no exception but that is not the counterintuitive mind-bogglingly weird part of QM. It is the probabilistic nature and the seeming acausality of it. It tests the limits of knowledge and measurement of a system. Things can be in two different places at once. The author takes his time and gently explains the utter uncanniness of this branch of physics. He is clear and a great expositor and writes in an easily digestible style. I may not go with him on Copenhagen but I recommend his book.
7,1847924573,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1411444-ed-erwin,5,"For years there was very little published comparing different interpretations of QM. Suddenly there seems to be a flood of them. While I loved What Is Real? by Adam Becker, this one might be even better. Becker was re-telling the history of QM and discussing the personalities of the scientists along with talking about interpretations. Ball skips almost completely over the history and personalities and just gets right down to what we currently know and several attempts at interpretation.Becker was more friendly to the Many Worlds Interpretation(s) which Ball pretty much considers logically inconsistent. (I share his sentiment, but don't fully follow the argument.) Ball gives much more detail on how ""decoherence"" could maybe avoid the ""measurement problem"". And Ball talks about recent ideas on whether ""super-quantum entanglement"" and ""PR boxes"" can exist and if not, why not. I'd only met that concept before in a ""graphic novel"" type book: Totally Random.I'm going to have to read this again later to really get my head around it.There are a few things I hate about this book. The title is horrible and the subtitle is worse. No table of contents. No chapter numbers. End notes are not numbered or linked easily to the page they are commenting on. But despite all that, this is excellent!"
8,1847924573,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69500282-hamid,5,"This is a book that tries to describe the weirdness of quantum mechanics. And I think it does a great job. Although it is written primarily for the general audience, I don't recommend it if you're not familiar with the ABC of QM. There are much simpler books out there. Quantum mechanics doesn’t tell us how a thing is, but what (with calculable probability) it could be, along with – and this is crucial – a logic of the relationships between those ‘coulds’. If this, then that.What this means is that, to truly describe the features of quantum mechanics, as far as that is currently possible, we should replace all the conventional ‘isms’ with ‘ifms’. For example:Not‘here it is a particle, there it is a wave’but‘if we measure things like this, the quantum object behaves in a manner we associate with particles; but if we measure it like that, it behaves as if it’s a wave’Not‘the particle is in two states at once’but‘if we measure it, we will detect this state with probability X, and that state with probability Y’"
9,1847924573,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20465079-tam,4,"Well, I like it, but should I recommend it?It really depends. If you are just curious intellectually then go ahead and check it out. It's not very easy though, after all you are trying to learn quantum physics. But it's manageable. That's an incredible feat that the author was able to achieve. I have zero background in quantum physics, though do work with probability. But Philip Ball speaks in such an intelligible language (despite him repeatedly saying the limit of language in expressing quantum ideas), without refering much if at all to math. I appreciate that some physicists in particular (and reasearchers in all fields in general) do care about the ""meaning(s)"" of of math and their experiments. It's also fun philosophically, as people still struggle with the implications and interpretations of quantum physics. It's an open ended question and you, by the end of the book, kind of participate in that discussion too. Which side do you take? I dislike the many worlds theory too, but not completely sold by the information theory one.The book is almost purely intellectual (except for a short discussion about computing, very cool indeed). There is no conclusion yet because it's still an intense debate, and you will only vaguely grasp a tiny bit of quantum physics. Whether it's worth your time, it's up to you."
10,1847924573,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7907737-john,5,"I was a bit hesitant about reading this book initially as I thought who needs yet another popular science book about quantum mechanics or the history of quantum mechanics. I decided to pick up a copy as Jim Al-Khalili gave it a glowing review. The good news is that this isn't just another history of quantum mechanics, but a great up to date account of where quantum theory is today. There is a lot of focus on the interpretation of QM from Many Worlds, Copenhagen Interpretation etc. through to modern ideas around quantum information and quantum computing. This is a really interesting read, but it isn't necessarily an easy read (coming from someone who did two quantum mechanics courses at degree level and two quantum field theory courses at masters level). It should appeal to mathematicians and physicists, but I would recommend the layperson reads the excellent  In Search of Schrodingers Cat first. "
11,1847924573,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6953429-elazar,3,"Took me a while to finish this book. It’s a reasonably good summary of what’s known and mostly what’s unknown about quantum mechanics. A bit too long and a bit repetitive. For me, the most important discovery was the notion/interpretation of QBism which I wasn’t aware of until now."
12,1847924573,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2412666-mangoo,4,"This brand new book - from one of the most prolific science divulgators, consistently delivering high to very high quality works on whatever field he chooses (and he chooses among very diverse ones) - fills a gap in many ways in the scenario of quantum mechanics literature. It is less technical than Ghirardi's ""Un'occhiata alle carte di Dio"" but as engaging; it is far less technical than Bricmont's ""Making sense of quantum mechanics"" but it is wider in scope, even concerning deep matters. While both aforementioned books are outstanding and highly recommended, Ball's stays mostly on the conceptual and implicational side of things, dispells several misconceptions (in fact, that's sort of the point of the book, eventually), includes ample treatment of decoherence (also as part of a long treatment of measurement and so-called wavefunction collapse), involves quantum computation as integral part of the attempts to elucidate what quantum theory is and allows, and describes attempts at ""quantum reconstruction"" that emerged recently and that are not even mentioned elsewhere. Interestingly, Ball covers bits and pieces of the book also in his long essays for e.g. Nautilus - for instance, the cloudy outlook on quantum supremacy, and the quantum reconstruction program - though in a different (and shorter, unfortunately) way.What you get is therefore a book that mostly maintains the high expectations that it elicited, and provides a very engaging, thoughtful and at times very deep read - as Ball's affectionate readers are accostumed to. There are cute illustrations scattered through, though more technicality would have spiced the book even better. I find it a pity that Ball has decided to glide too quickly across several fundamental or foundational interpretations of quantum mechanics ""without observers"" (like the De Broglie-Bohm interpretation, if only because favourite of Bell and Bricmont - which he even ridicules for missing experimental evidence, which is imprecise to say the least; or the GRW approach), while dedicating ample text only to the most fashionable interpretation (the Many Worlds). He is openly and rightly very critical about it, in spite of the many vociferous and illustrious sustainers (Deutsch, Tegmark, Carroll, Greene...is it that shared belief that made them write books?).The view that Ball expounds is that quantum mechanics is being now envisioned as a theory about information, about what can and cannot be manipulated about a system in terms of its information structure and content. This view only lightly reminds of Bohr's initial, almost dogmatic view while it incorporates the acknowledgment that there are fundamental limits to what is knowable (which still the quiet Danish, devout of Kant, would have thoroughly agreed upon). A big part of it seems to derive from the non-commutativity of operations on quantum systems (that's where ultimately the Heisenberg principle comes from, and not from the unavoidable perturbation induced by experimental apparati), which works also as discriminat between micro- and macroscopic domain. Why that is so is still left out.A big minus of the book sits unfortunately with the references: they are not signalled through the text to start with (supposedly to leave the text smooth), and the reference section (where the references have no number, but just the piece of text they are attached to) does not indicate division in chapters nor sections (the book is only informally divided into sections, which is kind of cool, but is no justification for not replicating those delimitations in the reference section), so it is hard to connect references and text (admittedly, the refereces are not that many, though). That's rather underwhelming. I wish they went back to the best method of putting references in paper books, which is as footnote in the same page the reference appears. Still, a very good book that does not completely follow the classical (pun intended) way of presenting the subject matter - that is, the historical sequence of events - and foreshadows a future didactic exposition where, as Susskind already did in his textbook - quantization appears last as a consequence of, not first access to, the theory.[Update 7 Sept. 2018] I have read the book for a second time meawhile, with the excuse to underline the text and write notes on the margins. I appreciate it as much and possibly more than the first time. The discussion of decoherence is a real highlight, while the quantum reconstruction is partial (as well as the quantum computing part), meaning that the author has written more extensively on that elsewhere (Quanta magazine, for instace). I still think it would do even better at spending more time on GRW and Bohmian mechanics, however it sort of compensates with listing the troubles with multiuniverses. I anyway cannot still get it an additional star because of the references - note to editors: please go back to putting references as footnotes at the bottom of text pages!"
13,1847924573,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5917740-nilesh,5,"This is not a review of the book - the book is fantastic with new insights pouring out in every section and with nary a word wasted. The rest of the writeup is an extended summary of my takeaways for whatever they are worth.Beyond Weird makes one think more than almost any other book on the subject. This reviewer has read dozens of books on quantum physics over the last two decades. For years, I have been swayed by, and against, different interpretations. Like any amateur, my impressions were roughly set by the last thing I read. For the first time, I have my own view. Three caveats before I get into it:I am an amateur. I do not have the language rigor or practice to explain what I feel precisely.My views are shaped mainly by the book again, which happens to be the last one I read! Unlike before, I have my modifications/hypothesis. I am astounded by how much more is known or almost proven about the decoherence. I am also impressed by the book's counters against the other popular schools of thought, particularly the Copenhagen interpretation as well as the many-world.I retain that quantum mechanics and interactions are not fully comprehensible in anything other than their raw equations. Interpretations sought any other way, particularly through natural languages, materially reduce its explicatory powers, if not lead to substantial errors.Finally, to my complete picture (a lot of it is derived from the author's beliefs in the book): All physical entities have quantum nature or quantumness. Schrodinger's equations give us a description of this quantum potential nature. These aspects of physical entities are probabilistic with particular randomness built-in, and humanity is yet to unearth it completely. The quantumness of any system is more apparent when it is reasonably small and allowed to operate in isolation. Physical entities' quantumness interact with each other when they come in close connections with each other. The quantumness entanglement is over and above what we know about influences through the classical forces. Let's say there is a new ""force,"" called quantum force (QF), to describe these interactions or entanglements involving the quantumness of the entities. QF is made up by me to understand quantum behavior and unlikely to be a real force in the traditional sense. That said, I so dream some QF-like to be the source of dark energy!Effectively, when quantum characteristics of different physical entities interfere with each other, some of the quantumness - particularly in the ""direction"" of the most robust interaction - fuse like two waves of different wavelengths. Combinations of differing wave functions, like interference of unharmonious waves, causes decoherence. As the book details, this decoherence is no longer a theory: some of it is well measured, including its pace and extent in quantum experiments. There is more to it: while a decoherence happens in one or more directions or dimensions of strongest intermingling, the entities continue to have quantumness in many other parts, albeit altered. One can argue that if a previous decoherence had eliminated the quantumness in one direction/dimension, call it A, a new entanglement along B would recreate quantumness (""recoherence""?) along A. When the extent of decoherence - because of the strength of QF - is exceptionally substantial in any dimension, it would appear like a collapse of quantumness in that dimension/parameter and emergence of a classical manifestation. My artificial QF to explain decoherence is an ultra short-range force. It looks like its impact is proportional to the ""size"" of the elements involved, which would explain the quick collapse caused by macro devices and/or the environment in the double slit. In other words, decoherence or collapse is measured on the smaller of the interacting elements as the quantumness of the larger elements is too faint and is even more faintly impacted by the smaller elements (Penrose may be onto something with the gravity hypothesis). Quantum scientists need to study this interaction frontier or the entanglement, and the associated decoherences more as it might unearth a lot more. For example, I feel that while a collapse happens in one/some directions of a quantum interaction, the quantumness is preserved and re-created in the ""non-aligned"" (poorly defined by me) directions.Let me elaborate on this: no environment seems to obliterate the quantumness of any element in all directions/dimensions. Decoherence appears to happen only along some parameters. Perhaps, the total quantumness of any system is always constant - so now we got a preservation law too! Or quantumness is only partially destroyed and is re-creatable. This is the reason why the universe still has particles exhibiting quantumness, and we did not have a complete collapse into everything classical at the Big Bang. So take the usual Stern-Gerlach experiment: a set of particles that pass through the z-axis filter interact with the environment such that a strong z-axis interaction leaves them polarised either up or down along the z-axis (pointer state). If measured again along the same axis, those with the up result the first time keep showing up and vice versa. Effectively, these particles' z-axis spin (einstate) has decohered and assumed a fixed value but not spin along any other axis. If the next environmental element causes decoherence along any other axis, the z-axis decoherence is lost (i.e., it gets scrambled or reobtains quantumness in its z-axis spin). We can rephrase what we have been explained more simplistically through the Heisenberg's. As per the uncertainty principle, the more one fixes the position, the less one can know about the momentum. Generalizing it, it seems the more one decoheres in one dimension, the less one does in many other (maybe all other) conjugal dimensions.The decoherence interpretation almost entirely explains the impact of the observation, which is nothing but introduction of an environment or elements that cause quantum interactions. Like in the relativity, the frame of reference matters in this line of thinking. The reference frame is different, as it is more about elements introduced to make the measurement and the decoherence they enforce. This is the reason why what matters depends on what questions are asked. There is nothing that seems to be absolute in quantum theory, either. Let's stretch this further. We know nothing about the quantumness interactions today. It is possible that as we understand them more, we might even be able to answer ""why this and not that."" It is conceivable that just like those myriads of unknown elements or forces that cause a standing pin to fall in one direction or not the other, we may have a quantum version of the same through interactions.Finally, I know what I believe in, at least as of today. As the author says, such interpretations are more a reflection of the believers' biases and leanings than whatever might be the reality. There is no compulsion for the reality to be of any human-conceived idea mold. That said, intuitive leaps of faith have helped the quantum science progress right from its inceptions. Major insights developed by Einstein (quantum nature of photons), Bohr (quantized orbits of the electron), Heisenberg (uncertainty principle), Bohm (probability imputation), Schrodinger's wave function were all well-judged guesses or hypothesis that made massive contributions to the field. Could it be the same for QF?!!Well, that's enough about my views based on what I understood. Let me also note some other well-made points in the book for future reference. Quantization, or the world being grainy at the smallest level, is a small part or effect of the quantum theory. Quantum theory is not because of the quantized nature of matter and energy but the other way around. In other words, nothing is staggering about the quantized nature by itself except that that is how the world is. The author beautifully summarises Susskind's views about where quantum mechanics is different from the classical. For most of us, the difference has something to do with the fact that the classical world is analog/continuous. At the same time, the base reality seems to be digital and discontinuous - quantum. The author/Susskind feels that this is not a big deal. Quantum theory has an entirely different mathematical abstraction or representation of the fundamental particles.Consequently, one obtains a comprehensively different type of abstraction or mathematical equation sets for their interactions with each other too. In quantum mechanics, there is a relationship between the state of the system and any measurements made on it. This implies that the equations on the state of the system are not enough until we decide where we want to deploy them (or how we want to measure) as there is not much reality without measurement. The book does well in its refutations of both the Copenhagen and the many-world notions. The descriptions are particularly enlightening when the author writes about quantum mechanics as an epistemic versus an ontic theory. The believers of its epistemic nature view the theory, and its components like wave function, as prescriptive. They are artificial constructs that help us forecast what we are likely to obtain if we make some measurements on the underlying system and nothing more or less. The Copenhagen interpretation is such an epistemic view.The ontic view is that QM equations (or its better future variants) are descriptive of the underlying reality the way classical parameters like density or temperature are. The epistemic believers generally do not like ""why"" questions or in-depth interpretations of the theory and are more of a ""shut up"" and calculate variety. The author does equally well in demystifying the classical, macro world we observe versus the underlying world of the particles. The former can be an emergent phenomenon of the latter as we have more reasons to believe in the decoherence. As we understand quantum entanglements/interactions better, we might even find answers to why this and not that (i.e., why we get one reality and not some other with a quantum collapse). This could be the best refutation of the many-world; the author does well in rebuffing it as a usable theory. That is, it adds little to our understanding even while extending the theoretical scope materially more without anything provable.The short book has useful sections on quantum computing as well. The section on how little is understood about quantum interactions and the end results from the gate-like conversions of qubits is most important. It highlights the need for science to focus on the decoherence. As we learn more about decoherence, quantum computing could make astounding progress, particularly if it is accompanied by a better ability to manipulate quantum states as well."
14,1847924573,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48011083-steve,4,"Mr. Ball provided the lay reader, me, an excellent distillation of the current frontiers in quantum physics, something of a second derivative to the underlying research in the field. Nary an equation appears; even the chapter titles are free of numerical ordering. And what from it?Mr. Ball capably reviewed the principal themes and characters involved in quantum physics today. We met Messrs. Schrödinger, Bohr, Planck, Heisenberg, Feynman, et alia. We read of entanglement, superposition, collapsing wavefunctions, decoherence, a Many Worlds Interpretation, etc. Then there was that famous cat and even some kittens.Because Mr. Ball is writing in the vernacular, he permits a line of thought to develop that begins with theory and observation and extends to philosophy. What is reality? How should we process causality? My understanding, now having read this work, is rather more unsettled in reply to those questions. To the firm answers associated with classical physics, quantum physics offers uncertainties, uncertainties that may very well never be satisfactorily resolved. I do also wonder whether we have met an experimental boundary, where theories can no longer be tested against observed natural phenomena because the measurement scales now defy the boundaries of engineering, to the extent measurements can even be made in light of the wily nature of the quantum world."
15,1847924573,http://goodreads.com/user/show/79768356-david-good,4,"A great book exploring the latest thinking on the meaning of quantum mechanics, one of the the strangest and most rigorously tested theories in all of science. Philip Ball steps through some of the key concepts of quantum mechanics, such as superposition, entanglement and decoherence, explaining what the latest research has to say about them. He also reviews the main historical interpretations of quantum mechanics in the light of the latest research and shows their failings. He covers the Copenhagen interpretation put forward by Niels Bohr in the 1930's, and the many worlds view developed by Hugh Everett in the 1950's, amongst others. Philip Ball also outlines recent developments that are taking the understanding of quantum mechanics in a different direction. In the course of this he dispels a number of myths about the theory, many of which we originated with founders of the theory in the 1930's and 1940's. For example, he explains how the uncertainty principle is not about the perturbation caused by measurement as Heisenberg originally popularised it.I have always been fascinated by quantum mechanics, and particularly it's philosophical interpretation. This book has changed my view of how to understand the theory. A great read."
16,1847924573,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7331806-rob-adey,3,"I had high hopes for a Philip Ball quantum book as he's a good and original pop science writer. The fact I didn't get on too well with it is probably because he pours super-cooled water on the multiple worlds interpretation, as well as some of the other famously strange bits of quantum physics. Not knowing the maths or actually being a physicist of any kind I've got no way of sensibly deciding whether he's wrong or not, of course (though as far as I can make out he has a chiefly hypocritical reason for discounting it - he says that a sort of aesthetic outrage against infinite universes being created at every quantum junction is not a valid reason for denying the MWI; half a page later, he seems to be saying a similar kind of outrage at the creation of infinite minds within those universes is why the MWI is unthinkable). But let's face it, infinite universes are much more fun for the lay reader to think about, so you're always going to come across a little curmudgeonly if you attack them."
17,1847924573,http://goodreads.com/user/show/282056-kim,4,"This is, I think, the book on quantum mechanics I've been wanting to read for 15 years—though my ability to embrace it may be due to my experience with the less-comprehensive titles I've read in the meantime. Superb, even if I did get snarled once or twice in Ball's explanations of experiments.Interesting, though, how many shades of Kant and Wittgenstein I kept encountering. I'm not sure if that's because they've greatly influenced quantum physicists, Ball, or if I just saw them because I love them so much (in true what-I-measure-affects-what-I-see quantum style).I also had the thought whilst reading that instead of us measuring the universe, perhaps the universe is measuring us...and trying all the time to tell us what it sees in ways we can comprehend."
18,1847924573,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2492905-jon-pensak,2,"I found this disappointing. The overall tone is off-putting as Ball condescends to historical figures and oversells the extent to wish decoherence answers outstanding questions in QM. (E.g., as far as I understand, the interpretation makes no unique, testable predictions.). Ball's self-promotional slant steers him away from going into any topic too deeply and instead we get a lot of repetition of a few reductive ideas. One is left wondering how constructive much of the ""foundations"" work being done really is."

21,1847924573,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61898144-diocletian,4,"After reading these ~350 pages I now feel like I know less about Quantum Mechanics (QM) than before I started. There were times when some of the concepts were beyond my comprehension (e.g. Popescu-Rohrlich boxes) but hopefully with some more reading and research, I'll be able to understand them.Ball starts to say, fundamentally that the crux of QM is that measurement on a system affects the outcome of measurements on the system itself. Quantization is not a requirement for QM. The book did solve a long held mystery of mine. How did Schrödinger come up his famous, eponymous, wave equation. He took the equation for waves and tweaked it using intuition, to what he thought would apply to particles. Miraculously it worked. Squaring the wavefunction of an object gives you the probability of finding the object at a given position when measured. QM is often misunderstood as a theory governing things only very small. However, entanglement shows that quantum effects can propagate over vast distances (non-locality). Schrödinger's cat, commonly misunderstood, is dispelled with swiftly in many ways. Firstly, in the way that Tegmark explains, the cat will die if in a vacuum, otherwise it'll interfere with air molecules (the environment) and decohere and no longer exhibit quantum effects (wavefunctions of macroscopic objects can't interfere or exist in a superposition if they aren't coherent). Further, the notion of a superposition of dead and alive states is meaningless, unless we define what they mean in quantum terms and then calculate the wavefunction. As an aside, Ball explains that superpositions aren't fragile. As they ""decohere"" their quantumness spreads out into the environment creating a large entity. System and environment merge into a single superposition. This effectively destroys the superposition as we can't discern it anymore by looking at a small part of it.Interestingly, physicists are actually trying to do this experiment dubbed Schrödinger's Kittens, albeit with much smaller matter - water bears (think around mesoscale/millimeters). QM teaches us that the order in which we do things (e.g. measurements) matters (non-commutable) dubbed Quantum Contextuality. In classical physics it doesn't matter. This partly explains the double slit experiment, you are in effect doing two different experiments to elicit a classical or quantum outcome. In terms of the uncertainty principle, this explains why we get the results we do. You can't know all the details of a quantum system, the more you measure, the more it will decohere. Until eventually it behaves as a classical system only. The Many Worlds Interpretation (MWI), was devised as a way to deal with apparent wave function collapse and where it goes afterwards. So now you've created an even bigger problem, of a parallel universe, rather than the smaller problem of wavefunction ""collapse"". Ball says the MWI is false because it cannot deal with the transfer of consciousness (to other ""yous"") after universe splitting, as it depends on user experience. Arguments I find more compelling are as follows: science has always told us that the very fine details don't matter and they should hardly be splitting universes. Proponents of MWI feel uncomfortable with proposals such as, Quantum Russian Roulette (if MWI is correct they shouldn't). Finally for me personally, we can't do an experiment to prove MWI correct, so it is unscientific in this regard. MWI does not tell us how the splitting occurs, only that it does. I was pleasantly surprised to find several pages devoted to quantum computing (QC). Ball says that QC won't necessarily revolutionise home computing. Although they may solve P=NP type problems quicker, breaking current encryption methods easily, they wouldn't really speed up things modern computers already do well. QC is a long way off anyway, currently they can just about find prime factors of 21. It was interesting to learn how they worked. Ultimately, Ball concludes QM is a theory about the representation and manipulation of information. Further, that the theory needs rewriting from the bottom up (Quantum Reconstruction) so that it's not about waves or particles. That if you start with a few fundamental rules, properties do emerge that describe behaviour of quantum objects. Concluding, Ball condenses QM down to 3 axioms:1. You can't transmit information faster than light (no-signalling)2. You can't deduce or perfectly copy the information in an unknown quantum state (no-cloning)3. There is no unconditionally secure bit commitment (relating to cryptography)Much of the problems talking about QM come from language. In that, we lack the vocabulary to accurately describe properties of quantum objects. We have to borrow words such as spin and entanglement. Entanglement could be the key to the long-standing mystery of how to reconcile quantum mechanics with he theory of gravitation as supplied by general relativityNot‘here it is a particle, there it is a wave’but‘if we measure things like this, the quantum object behaves in a manner we associate with particles; but if we measure it like that, it behaves as if it’s a wave’Not‘the particle is in two states at once’but‘if we measure it, we will detect this state with probability X, and that state with probability Y’What the MWI really denies is the existence of facts at all. It replaces them with an experience of pseudo-facts (we think that this happened, even though that happened too). In so doing, it eliminates any coherent notion of what we can experience, or have experienced, or are experiencing right now. We might reasonably wonder if there is any value – any meaning – in what remains, and whether the sacrifice has been worth itWhen someone explains something in a complicated way, it’s often a sign that they don’t really understand it. A popular maxim in science used to be that you can’t claim to understand your subject until you can explain it to your grandmother.The key difference between classical and quantum mechanics is that the first calculates trajectories of objects while the second calculates probabilities (expressed as a wave equation)"

Quantum objects are what they are, and we have no reason to suppose that ‘what they are’ changes in any meaningful way depending on how we try to look at them.""""Everything that seems strange about quantum mechanics comes down to measurement.""""What is more fundamental – a fact established by logic or one established by observation?""Is measurement the limit of our understanding of the macro-world?

And I've read many, from popular science books to physics textbooks. Ball has a take-down of the many worlds interpretation, for which he has little patience, but that isn't the main focus of the book. He starts with the Copenhagen interpretation, but criticizes it as insufficient and unsatisfying, mostly because it states that we are simply not allowed to ask certain questions. He offers a different, more comprehensive set of answers to the big questions: why isn't the macro world like the quantum world? what is a measurement and how does it affect the system? It's essentially a well-written, well-reasoned examination of the questions that Shroedinger's cat bring up. There's also extensive discussion of quantum entanglement.And then after most of this is a very good discussion of quantum computing: the status of research, what might be possible, why it might be possible.I imagine that you'd have to be intrinsically interested in quantum mechanics to stick with a book on a topic that's this complicated, but as long as you have the curiosity, I strongly recommend curling up with this one to ponder the nature of reality.I got a copy to review from Net Galley."
27,1847924573,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59682834-jerry-pogan,4,"Utterly fascinating! I've read dozens of books about Quantum Mechanics over the years. My interest is driven solely by curiosity and not aptitude. I can honestly say I don't really understand it and at a much deeper level than most who are interested in it. This book explains some of my problems with the subject and that is that, although, it has been proven beyond any doubt the results are totally up for interpretation in a wildly varying variety of ways. That is because it defies any form of common sense relating to everything else we know about the world. Philip Ball did an excellent job in explaining many of these concepts but I have to admit even with his well thought out explanations much of it was still beyond my grasp."
28,1847924573,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6423134-bernie-gourley,4,"Quantum mechanics is so mystifying and baffling that I even misunderstood the title of Philip Ball’s book on the subject at first. I thought “Beyond Weird” was being used as is in, “twelve miles outside of Weird, almost all the way to ‘Incomprehensibly-bizarre-burg,’ is where one finds quantum theory.” About two-thirds of the way through the book, I realized that what he meant was that it’s time to move beyond thinking of the subject as one that – while it works well for the technologist’s practical purposes -- is impossible to make any sense of with the human mind. [Perhaps the author wants to move “Beyond Weird” because the popular descriptions of quantum mechanics paint a picture that’s hard for the average reader to differentiate from magic – i.e. things popping in and out of existence inexplicably, things seeming to be in two irreconcilably different states at once, particles interacting instantaneously across light-years, etc. It all sounds like the stuff of a Harry Potter novel.] Who knows, maybe Ball meant “beyond weird” in both ways, like a quantum object is said to be both particle and a wave. (Though Ball weakly rejects that notion as untrue, though stating that sometimes it might as well be true.)What is weird about the quantum world? To oversimplify, one can think of three interconnected conundrums. The first set of challenges I’ll group together as measurement problems. This includes both the fact that observing evidence of a quantum object cannot be done without influencing the nature of that evidence, and the fact that measuring one characteristic may limit the accuracy with which one can measure another. The second challenge, which derives from the first, is often called wave-particle duality, and it’s the fact that evidence of the same entity or object may sometimes suggest it’s more particle-like and other times that it behaves in a more wave-like fashion. [As is famously observed in double-slit experiments.] A third counter-intuitive fact is quantum entanglement, which is observed when one quantum object is observed and another that has become entangled with it instantaneously displays a corresponding measure. [The reader will note that, even after reading the book, I’m sure that I’m not describing these ideas in nearly sufficient precision to make them truly accurate. And still I’m writing convoluted sentences in attempt to give it my best shot to accuracy. And that’s just how confusing the topic is.]  Because the world behaves oddly at a quantum scale when compared to the world we see (the one that is governed by classical physics,) many paradigms have been established to try to convey what is happening to non-specialists. These models are necessarily oversimplifications. A lot of what Ball does is try to wring a tiny bit more clarity out of what goes on at the quantum scale by describing in greater detail what is true, false, or under contention about what we “see” in quantum objects. This is how Ball comes up with chapter titles such as: “Quantum objects are neither wave nor particle, (but sometimes they might as well be.” Or, “Quantum particles aren’t in two states at once (but sometimes they might as well be.)” The first half of the book is mostly spent trying to clean up the public perception of quantum mechanics a little. Completely clarifying the subject isn’t yet possible. If it was, the value of such a volume would be minimal. In the second half of the book, Ball gets into the influence of quantum mechanics on technology (and, in particular, tries to give the lay-reader some concept of what is being talked about when technologists talk of quantum computing.) He also explores some of the theories that are being pursued in the halls of academia to try to make sense of the parts of quantum mechanics that we can’t yet wrap our heads around. This includes the many-worlds interpretation in which each [“decision”] event results in a schism of the universe, such that Schrodinger’s -- much misunderstood -- cat isn’t in a super-position of alive and dead, but is alive in one branch universe and dead in the other. The book ends with a chapter entitled, “Can we get to the bottom of it?” There is hope that once we are able to look at the subject from the right angle, it will all clear up. Humans do have difficulty making sense of scales that are smaller or bigger than those of our daily experience, as well as time scales shorter than we can notice or longer than we live. We are viewing the world through frames, and those frames create – in a sense – blinders. Some scientists hope that one day we’ll be free of whatever frame (e.g. inability to experience all dimensions of space, time, or space-time) is limiting our capacity to understand the quantum. As one would expect of this type of book, there are graphics, notes, and a bibliography. My primary interest in quantum mechanics involves its implications (if any) for consciousness, and this is not a subject that Ball gets into in much detail beyond discussing Eugene Wigner’s views on the subject and touching on the ideas of David Bohm. Wigner was a Nobel Prize-winning scientist who believed that consciousness caused wave-form collapse. It should be noted that there are many scientists who feel that there is no need to think consciousness exerts any influence outside the skull of the conscious one. However, it remains an open question, and it’s not clear whether those who reject it have much better ideas or just have a knee-jerk reaction to that which might halt the onward march of the Copernican revolutionary norm. Though ideas at the interaction of consciousness and the quantum are not explored in great detail in Ball’s book, I still found it of use for edging a little closer to what goes on at a quantum scale than past popular science books have gotten me. I’d recommend this book for the non-physicist who wants a little better grasp on quantum theory. It’s readable and helps separate wheat from chaff with respect to popular models of quantum mechanics.

30,1847924573,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32994630-tikkers,5,"This is a review of the Kindle edition of “Beyond Weird”, the format was easy to read.The book comes with a comprehensive bibliography which appears to be useful. It also has a good index.I imagine that the book will appeal to students and educated laymen alike.I found it absorbing and interesting. Hence the 5 stars. I will be rereading it and following up on some items in the bibliography.Firstly, this is not about how quantum mechanics is weirder than you ever thought. If you don’t know quantum mechanics (QM) is weird, it would be a good idea to introduce yourself to the history of the subject; you will see why It has this reputation. Neither is this a book from which you might teach yourself QM. You should seek out another if that is what you need. The book contains no mathematics or equations. It is an ideas book in which Ball provides the reader with an excellent account of the state of play as of 2018. I use the words “complex Hilbert space” in a quote from the book below. It is neither necessary to know what a complex Hilbert space is to read the book (or understand my review!) nor is it the case that if you know what this is then the book is a waste of time for you.Bohr and Einstein could not agree on what, if any reality underlay QM. It may be tempting (justifiably so) to give up, abandon further inquiry and dismiss QM as “weird”. After all, it remains true that attending “any meeting about the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics is like being in a holy city in great tumult. You will find all the religions with all their priests pitted in holy war”. The priests agree on the foundational scriptures, but they diverge on the interpretation. The experts are not of one mind. Ball invites us to go “Beyond” our concern with weirdness and bring ourselves up to date with current thinking about what the theory means. What underlying reality if any, does Schrödinger’s equation describe or even hint at?Paradoxes which have illuminated difficulties with the subject have been with us for many years. Schrödinger's Cat (is it, could it be, both dead and alive?) and the EPR paradox (does “quantum entanglement” entail instantaneous action at a distance, breaking relativity?) are amongst the conceptually difficult ideas tackled here.Interpretations of QM are explained and evaluated. We are taken through Bohr's (the Schrödinger equation tells us all that can be known) Everett and Deutsch's (many worlds interpretation), Qbism (an even stronger reliance Schrödinger than Bohr) and others. Currently, attempts are being made to find satisfying axiomatic foundations; some are described here. The motivation behind this can be appreciated if we compare an example of a “standard” set for QM like:“1. For every system there is a complex Hilbert space H.2. States of the system correspond to projection operators onto H.3. Those things that are observable somehow correspond to the eigenprojectors of Hermitian operators.4. Isolated systems evolve according to the Schrödinger equation.”with the laws of motion underlying Newtonian mechanics:“1. Every object keeps moving at the same speed if no force is applied to it. If it is still to begin with, it stays still.2. If a force is applied to an object, it accelerates in direct proportion to that force, and in the direction of that force.”3. For every force that one body exerts on another, the other body exerts an equal force back in the opposite direction.”Ball points out that given the difference in the language in the two sets of axioms, it is not surprising that there is a push for a quantum reconstruction. He describes an informational approach to QM and why it is seen as potentially fruitful given the peculiarities and limitations of types of information available from quantum systems.I get the impression that the informational approach is his favourite. A substantial minority of practitioners in the field still favour Bohr's view. Ball is harshest with the many worlds interpretation. To repeat, I found this to be an excellent survey which has equiped me to venture deeper into the alleyways of that tumultuous city, listen to the priests and perhaps form an opinion of my own on the merits of their competing interpretations."
31,1847924573,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15091414-ryan,4,"I’ve long been fascinated by quantum physics even though I barely understand it. Beyond Weird is no exception. I readily admit that I had trouble comprehending much of it, though I enjoyed trying nonetheless.Beyond Weird reviews the perplexing aspects of quantum mechanics and tries to bring greater clarity to it beyond just declaring them “weird.” Such perplexing aspects of quantum mechanics include quantum tunneling (in which particles pass through barriers that they physically should not be able to pass through), wave-particle duality (quantum objects behave as both a wave and a particle, resulting in a wave function determining the probability of a particle location), superposition (a quantum particle can be located both “here” and “there” simultaneously), the uncertainty principle (we can’t simultaneously and precisely know two paired properties of quantum objects), entanglement (in which two or more quantum particles can be related so that action on one will have a simultaneous effect on the other no matter how far the other is located), and that we can’t measure anything in the quantum realm without disturbing it.Perhaps the most famous and foundational quantum experiment is the double slit experiment in which a single electron is fired at a screen and a barrier is placed in its path in between with just two slits through which the electron could pass. When the electron is not measured on its path to the screen, it travels as a wave and passes through both slits simultaneously. When the electron is measured on its path, it travels as a particle and only passes through one slit. The act of measurement changes the nature of the electron and related experiments have shown that this is not bound by time, the nature of the electron can change as if by going back in time to adjust to the presence of measurement. Not only that, but the state of a quantum object changes depending on the way it is measured. So it is as if the very act of measuring brings a quantum state into existence, before measurement it is just a wave function of probable states in which the quantum object can be in multiple possible locations at the same time.Another fascinating aspect of quantum mechanics is that quantum entanglement has some sort of connection to the very existence of space time, but we don’t understand yet what it is. Quantum entanglement means two or more particles share a property or characteristic no matter how far apart they may be (they could be on opposite sides of the universe). Quantum entanglement thus produces a phenomenon called non-locality. A way to understand this is if two people wear one sweatshirt in different locations at the same time. They share the same sweatshirt (not identical copies) in different locations simultaneously. Wrap your mind around that!The quantum world becomes classical (the world of large objects that we are used to) due to the decoherence of the quantum wave function caused by its interaction with its environment. If we could control decoherence (which is effectively impossible) then theoretically we could potentially produce superposition (existing both “here” and “there” simultaneously) of larger classical objects.One of the stranger implications of quantum superposition is the possibility of alternate universes. Theoretically, there could be a nearly infinite number of alternate universes with alternate versions of me in which everything that can happen, does happen. The author, however, argues against the likelihood of this. I didn’t find his arguments very convincing, but then, I didn’t fully understand them either.The author dedicates some time to discussing the state of quantum computers and quantum encryption, though I even found this difficult to comprehend.Ultimately, the author argues that quantum mechanics is not a theory of tiny particles and waves but instead is a theory about information and its causative influence. In other words, it is about how much we can deduce about the world by looking at it and how that depends on intimate, invisible connections between “here” and “there.” I’m not entirely sure what that means, but what is quite clear is that quantum mechanics calls into question the very nature of reality as we understand it."
32,1847924573,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25999818-jason-oliver,5,"Beyond Weird - Why Everything You Thought You Knew About Quantum Physics Is Different.I am not normally susceptible to click bait, but this title got me. I my first thought, ""What do you think I know about Quantum Physics"" and my second ""And why is it wrong""But this book is not about what you think and is commonly known about Quantum Physics is wrong. Its ""Different"" An ideological shift in how we view what we know about Quantum Physics.The author starts off saying, if you think you can explain Quantum Physics with language, then you don't fully understand Quantum Physics and then to proceeds to tell you with language what Quantum Physics is....and what it is not.Ball does a great job of describing different quantum theories and quantum mechanics and then explaining that things such as superposition, entanglement, and the uncertainty principle are not what Quantum Physics is. Instead, the things we know about Quantum Physics are measurements or information about the Quantum world. We have yet to discover, and may never discover what Quantum Mechanics is. Ball focuses, not on answers, but instead, asking the right question.He traces Quantum Physics, not from a chronological historical view, but from a building block view, actually leaving some of the first ""discoveries"" for much later in the book to help get a better sense of the Quantum world. But again, this book is just as much about what Quantum Physics is not.The book is an easy read and the concepts are in easy to understand language but the concepts are not intuitive and very abstract and language cannot really depict the Quantum world.Beyond a shift in view of what I thought I knew, I also learned new things about Quantum Physics. While reading the book, I realized most of the physics books I've read are from the 90s and early 2000, or only had chapters on Quantum Physics. Here, more recent discoveries, theories and experiments are talked about. Quantum computing and Quantum Cryptography are covered. I especially enjoyed the cryptography after reading The Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography.I also loved the chapter entitled ""The Everyday World is What Quantum Becomes at Everyday Scales"" as I was not aware that a theory and experiments have been done to find a correlation between the classical world we live in and the quantum world.Its a great book."
33,1847924573,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18293816-bill-leach,5,"Church's book describes quantum mechanics, virtually without math. The chapters are presented as a series of ideas:- quantum objects are neither a wave nor a particle- measurement apparently causes waveform collapse- Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle- decoherence- entanglementA few chapters are devoted to quantum computing. Surprisingly, the concept of how quantum computing may work is quite controversial with many ideas having been proposed.The Copenhagen Interpretation sees that quantum mechanics is only a description of the real world. It holds that ""... measurement and observation bring specific realities into being from a palette of possibility.""Ball looks at alternatives to the Copenhagen Interpretation. David Bohm has proposed that a quantum field that guides particles, providing the quantum effects. The most controversial is the many worlds theory proposed by Hugh Everitt.""Increasingly, it looks more logical to frame quantum mechanics as a set of rules about information: what is and isn't permissible when it comes to sharing, copying, transmitting and reading it.""John Wheeler felt that if we really understood the central point of quantum mechanics, we ought to be able to state it in a simple sentence. Chris Fuchs shares this view, believing that one day we will be able to describe quantum mechanics in relatively simple words. To this end a number of scientists are engaging in reconstruction where they attempt to identify some fundamental quantum axioms that are physically meaningful and show how quantum mechanics emerges from these. The feeling is that we are looking at quantum mechanics from the wrong perspective. Clifton, Bub and Halvorson believe that Quantum mechanics is about information and with three rules, one can deduce much of quantum behaviour including superposition, entanglement, uncertainty and non-locality.Toward the end of the book, Church raises the question of whether quantum mechanics describes something that is really out there (an ontic theory), or merely describes what we can know about the world (an epistemic theory).An excellent book, not only because it explains current thinking on quantum concepts, but also shows the range of opinion and how unsettled the field is."
34,1847924573,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54618585-santhanakrishnan,0,"A gripping account on quantum world, read once more! Made it a point to read this gripping work once again (first read being in Jan/Feb'19) - just to be sure I picked up the concepts a bit more clearly. Quantum mechanics and theory is such that even without the complex Math equations associated, it could be quite challenging to comprehend - especially as it dfeies familiar logic (apparent wave and/or particle duality of elementary particles or more generally 'superposition of states', results of experiments varying based on whether they are measured or not as in the famous double slit experiment and interference patterns, and finally(?) the notorious 'entanglement' which puzzled even Einstein - since instantaneous correlation of property of one particle on another appeared to violate speed of light). For the folks who love physics / science in general but aren't full time scientists, this is a great primer on how quantum mechanics looks so unreal, but is at the base of everyday life and the many concepts / experiments in science we have come across in high school. Towards the end, the way the book summarizes the many counterintuitive observations as a possible outcome of how in nature 'one bit of information encoded in a fundamental constituents of a system' could be a limit, and that making a measurement* of any sort (say measurement of the spin) extracts that one bit, making everything else about that particle unknowable (since we sacrificed the 'degree of freedom' to measure some other prooerty by using it to extract the one bit already) - simply blows the mind, opens up new ways of thinking, and continues to keep the promise of Science being the greatest thriller of human lives. (*Note - even the slightest of interaction with the environment counts as a measurement. This also explains the very famous quantum scale vs every day life's macro scale paradox 'Schrodinger's Cat'). All in all, a fantastic read if you love physics / science. "
35,1847924573,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6944024-maynard-handley,3,"The good: As you would expect from Philip Ball, it's a better, and better organized, summary of the state of interpretations of QM than anything else out there.The bad:- Like everyone else, his analyses of the existing interpretations take into account nothing related to QFT and precious little related to relativity; it's like everyone engaged in this subject is mentally trapped in 1927. - He hates many-worlds, but his arguments against it are his own, not those of the establishment, and their lousiness shows. His arguments are essentially+ many-worlds is bloated and multiplies entities. Apparently he's unaware that science has been doing this pretty much ever since we left behind us the universe consisting of a geocentric solar system that began 6000 years ago. All those galaxies? All those billions of years in the past (and so many more in the future)? That's somehow ""acceptable"" bloat?+ if many-worlds is true, ethics will break down. This seems like a rerun of every argument against Galileo and Darwin. In the first place, so what? Physics doesn't depend for truth on what's best for ethics. In the second place, this is as crazy and ignorant as the claim that the only reason people ever behave decently is because they believe otherwise god will punish them. We behave decently to our future selves, and we behave decently towards random strangers. Why would a wide-spread belief in many-worlds suddenly convert us into psychopathic hedonists eager to hurt others on the theory that somehow, somewhere, that will benefit some tiny fraction of our future selves?"
36,1847924573,http://goodreads.com/user/show/96810550-paul-watts,5,"I have had a keen but layman’s interest in the Quantum World for as long as I can remember, since first discovering the topic as a child in my set of children’s encyclopaedias.While I don’t have the brain power, or the mathematical ability, to fully understand everything explained in this book there nevertheless have been some truly profound moments reading this book that have immensely enlarged my understanding of this topic.In particular I have always been puzzled on how the quantum world can seemingly operate in such a radically different way to the “classical” view of the world we see around us and how the two can co-exist at the same time with such fundamentally different “views”.The section on “decoherence” in this book was the lightbulb moment that built on everything before it and fully answered this question for me based on observable experiments (the scientific method).This is one of those books that you need to keep reading, even if you don’t fully understand all that you have read. The nice thing is you are not alone on this as some of the greatest minds, including Einstein, have been at a loss to explain it.This book opens the mind to so many possibilities and areas of exploration, in a scientific way, that transcends the physical science into the very nature of “reality” and the structure of space-time itself. I’m truly in awe of some of the physical experiments that have been devised to demonstrate and prove these quantum concepts and the genius of the minds behind them as written about in this book.If you are even remotely interested in this topic then I highly recommend reading this book."
37,1847924573,http://goodreads.com/user/show/99127157-alex,5,"Finally. This is the real face of quantum mechanics, beyond the easy but misleading metaphors and wonky generalisations, to the real philosophical and physical challenges of the theory and the cutting-edge work that is currently pinning down what QM really means. If you've often wondered whether an quantum mechanical ""observer"" means a person or whether there are ways to distinguish between ""interpretations"" of the theory, this is the book for you. It's a challenging read, but purely out of necessity. There are paragraphs that you'll need to re-read to really grasp their implications, and the way ideas build upon each other means you'll want to get through the book in a week, lest you forget some important principle, but the rigour and clarity of the writing mean that if you stick with it, you'll really get to understand why QM is so important.My one qualm is about the chapter on the ""many worlds interpretation"". I don't think that Ball is wrong here, or that his arguments are misplaced, but unlike the rest of the book this chapter places a lot more stock in the apparent absurdity of certain conclusions about consciousness and the sense of self, rather than the strict philosophical or physical problems those conclusions cause. It's also the only chapter that really seems to be coming directly out of Ball himself, rather than Ball presenting the conclusions of the experts in the field. That said it's a thought provoking section towards the tail end and I think the book would've been weaker and less interesting without it."

It was my time of year to go to the movies; it occurred to me that the parallel universes from which all that Marvel power---all that almost infinite energy---was being stolen might come looking for it. Hmmm. According to Phillip Ball, it won't happen. On the other hand, the results of experiments on quantum subjects are not much less unbelievable than the movies.Yes, we've known for a long time that quantum mechanics seems to be weird. At first blush, the ""Beyond Weird"" title might seem to suggest a discussion of things even more bizarre than we have come to expect. But what is being proposed is that we move beyond our perception of weirdness and ask different questions, expect different answers, and accept that the Universe might not accord to our intuition. The standard way of telling the quantum story is to relate the history, thereby building odd on top of strange on up to plain weird. Mr. Ball does tell a lot of the story, but he includes recent ideas and perspectives and forsakes strict chronology. Quantum is never easy. Ball makes it as understandable as I've ever read it, going deeply and widely and including material ripped from today's journals, so to speak.Highly Recommended"
39,1847924573,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62519741-drew,4,"I would not recommend this as a first book on quantum physics. This doesn't get deeply into all the ins and outs of all the commonly discussed weird things that make quantum physics fascinating to the non-physicist. It would be best to have exposure to those phenomena under your belt first. What this book does is to take the reader beyond the anecdotes and history and personalities of the subject and instead poses some questions about how we should be thinking about quantum physics and all the weirdness that comes with it. The author does a fantastic job of doing just that. Is it a theory of information more than physics? Does the math come first or does it follow? Are we asking the right questions, and what role does our asking play in what we expect to find out? Admittedly, there are parts of this book that required the rereading of a few pages at a time to stay with the concepts being described. There were others that were incompatible with my second scotch. But relating and analysing some of the topics in this book - using language to describe something that seems indescribable at times - is very, very difficult. That effort is a tall order, but the author does a great job with it."

This accidental discovery was to change physics and also our understanding of the universe.Quanta is neither wave nor particle and can be both inside and outside a box like Schrodinger’s cat. Does the inability to understand something logically make it untrue? Of course not. However, does it smell like the ancients use of ether to force their math to work? Maybe... If you have any interest in science, the inability of scientists to explain the weird behavior of quantum mechanics is fascinating. If you have ever wanted to be Galileo discovering the Earth circles the Sun, there is an obvious task for you to take on. I suspect that the elusive Unified Field Theory will also be found by an amateur who has no fixed ideas of how physics should work.

The book is one of the best summaries of the current state of quantum mechanics and why normal analogies don't work when describing the quantum world. The author steps through the development of the theory and largely ignores quantum history which is to the book's service. Normally, the first 1/3 to 1/2 of a book on quantum mechanics for a lay audience is just going to be history which gives a skewed presentation of where the topic actually stands. The book does an excellent job of pointing out where metaphors break and where historical ideas where discarded and then talks about current possible interpretations. I think it's a little hard on the Many Worlds Interpretation because it quickly gets hung up on the logical implications of what ""I"" and ""likely"" mean in such a world. I feel this was overly semantic and points out flaws in language not in the theory.The book also does a good break down of the variants of the Bell experiments, their various loopholes, and what we've done to eliminate them. It also suggests a few ways This book is more accurately a book on the state of quantum foundations. What the model is that we feel is underlying the experiments we do and not just the mathematical formalism. If you want a quick survey, start here. "

Terrific grasp of both the parts and the whole, made me understand concepts that had seemed mysterious or cuckoo before. He also brought things together in my mind that I’d been thinking about but had never quite gotten to gel. Though presented by a journalist, it's no shallow popularization. He brings up numerous aspects of the subject I’ve never seen mentioned before, and carefully, even-handedly discusses all the major (and many minor) outlooks and controversies in the field. There's no math at all, yet he brings out the kind of subtleties that are usually glossed over in ""layman"" texts. If you really want to understand  quantum mechanics (as much as it can be understood), this is superb both as an overview or an in-depth look at its subtleties.

Because we are used to think of the universe in Einsteinian terms (or really in Newtonian terms) of course the quantum world seem weird. Ball's approach is ""So what?"". Facts are facts and interpretation s may be unhelpfull. At the same time, he is no fan of the ""Shut up and calculate"" school. His attitude is more ""It is what it is"" and it is no welder than Newton's postulate of an unknown force. Besides, Ball recounts one of the best physic jokes. Ervin Schroedinger is driving down the highway. He is stopped by a cop. ""Do you have anything in the trump?"" the cop asked. "" a cat in a box, "" he replies. The cop looks in the trunk. ""There's a dead cat in a box here Has it been dead a long time?"". Schlesinger replies , ""It has been now."""

61,1847924573,http://goodreads.com/user/show/83804966-sandy,5,One of my favourite books on this topic. Great read.
62,1847924573,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61084294-lawrence-plummer,5,Definitely agree with the title! This was a mind bender and very interesting. Just illustrates what I am loving about quantum physics in the context of today.
63,1847924573,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13831188-glen,5,Simply the best attempt to describe and help understand what quantum mechanics is and is not.
64,1847924573,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19239134-govind-nair,5,This book presents a very compelling argument for the Copenhagen interpretation of Quantum Mechanics.

66,1847924573,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30821178-matt,2,"This book is both good and bad. Unless you have already read it, in which case you will know if it is either good or bad. I already measured it."
67,1847924573,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23288130-rebecca-otis,4,"Dense, but a good explanation of the state of the science."
68,1847924573,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67393598-jeffrey,5,Quantum physics undermines our belief in the reality of particles dancing through space-time.
69,1847924573,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6232534-joe,5,"Outstanding, and fairly readable, even for the non-scientific. I don't recall seeing a single equation. If you're curious about the state of the art in QM research, this is the one to read"
70,1847924573,http://goodreads.com/user/show/90592607-jacques,4,"Read this one over and over, always entertaining"
