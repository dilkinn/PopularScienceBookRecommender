0,1400032253,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68583290-jamie,4,"If you decide to read this book, get the print version. I read the Amazon ebook, and the software that was used to make the digital conversion had problems with Greek letters and math symbols, so most of the time alpha, beta, pi, and the square root symbol were rendered as question marks. For example, the caption to Figure 12.4 starts with, “The relative shift (??/?) in the value of the fine structure constant...” Well that’s helpful. In addition, the images and equations printed as graphics are tiny and faint, almost impossible to decipher. Amazon does occasionally release updates to its ebook editions, so it is possible that this will be fixed in the future, but for now it is a mess.It is a pity that the presentation of this book is so annoying, because the content is really interesting. I admit that when I picked it up I thought it was going to be about the histories and uses of the kinds of symbols we all grew up using, such as pi, e, and c, with perhaps things like Avogadro’s Number thrown in. Nope, it is about the cosmological constants that give form and structure to the universe, such as the fine structure constant, Planck’s constant, the speed of light, and similar values which shape the cosmos into something that can support life as we understand it.The physicist George Gamov created a wonderful little explanation tying the constants together. I can’t summarize it any better than this book's author did, so I will use his words:[Consider] the central importance of the constants of Nature characterizing gravity (G), quantum reality (h), and light (c). We can use them to paint a simple picture of the correspondences between different laws of Nature. We need only to appreciate a simple principle. When G is set to zero we are turning off the force of gravity and ignoring it; when h is set to zero we are ignoring the quantum nature of the Universe, through which energies can only take on particular values, like steps on a ladder. The size of the steps between the rungs are fixed by h. If h were zero there would be no gaps and the energy of an atom could change by any value, no matter how small. Third, when c is set equal to infinity (or, what is the same thing, 1/c equal to zero) then light signals move with infinite speed. This was the picture in Newton’s day, with gravity acting instantaneously between the Earth and the Sun.If all three of these constants are set to zero you get Newtonian Mechanics. Leave g and h at zero but apply c and you get Special Relativity. Set c and G equal to zero and apply h and you get Quantum Mechanics. Apply h and G but leave c at zero and you have Newton’s theory of gravity. Set h to zero and apply G and c and you get Einstein’s theory of General Relativity, which can also be reached by applying gravity to Special Relativity. Start with Quantum Mechanics and apply a finite value of 1/c and you reach Quantum Field Theory. From there set 1/c=0 and you get the quantum version of Newtonian gravity. Finally, apply all of them to get a theory that is relativistic, gravitational, and quantum and you reach that mysterious, as yet undiscovered unified Theory of Everything. (pg. 57-59) This is the kind of thing you read, then re-read a couple of times, then lean back and stare at the ceiling for a while.There is also an excellent discussion of the conditions which must exist for the universe to be hospitable to life. Notwithstanding the caveat that life may have evolved in forms completely different from our own, it would be unlikely to exist anywhere if gravity were slightly heavier, thus pulling the expanding primordial matter back before it had the time to form stars, galaxies, and the heavier elements. Another such constraint, which I had not heard of before, is that “a change of more than 0.4 per cent in the constants governing the strength of the strong nuclear force or more than 4 per cent in the fine structure constant would destroy almost all carbon or almost all oxygen in every star.” (p.155)The author also makes a few comments on what an advanced extraterrestrial life form may be like we see a trend in our own technological societies towards the fabrication of smaller and smaller machines that consume less and less energy and produce almost no waste. Taken to its logical conclusion, we expect advanced life-forms to be as small as the laws of physics allow...we might mention that this could explain why there is no evidence of extraterrestrial life in the Universe. If it is truly advanced, even by our standards, it will most likely be very small, down to the molecular scale. All sorts of advantages then accrue. There is lots of room there – huge populations can be sustained. Powerful, intrinsically quantum computation can be harnessed. Little raw material is required and space travel is easier. You can also avoid being detected by civilizations of clumsy bipeds living on bright planets that beam continuous radio noise into interplanetary space.” (p.170)There is only one statement the author makes that brought me up short. Either I am misunderstanding what he is getting at or there is a typo in the text. On page 252 is the statement, “light travels at a finite speed and so the farther away a star is from us the longer it has taken for its light to reach us. In the case of the Sun the light travel time is very short, about 3 seconds.” Really? Given the distance the Sun is from the earth it should take about 8 minutes for its light to reach us.Finally, there is a discussion about whether constants are truly constant or if they were different in the early universe, and perhaps may be slowly changing even today. This raises the interesting possibility that we live within a finite slice of time where the conditions of life are possible, and that in the future the changing constants may close that window and extinguish life.I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I found lots of new information that I had not known, and the author does a great job of setting up thought provoking scenarios that the reader keeps coming back to again and again."

2,1400032253,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21177142-roger,3,"Don't be misled by title - this is a book about cosmology, the structure of the universe, and how life, of the sort we know, fits in. I struggled with the first few chapters because I didn't feel that the author really explained why so few fundamental physical constants (primarily, the speed of light, the gravitational constant and Planck's constant) are needed to describe the universe. I was expecting there to be a lot more, such as the masses of the particles comprising the standard model, the strength of the Higgs' field, etc, and Barrow didn't seek to explain why these were not fundamental constants. And having finished the book I'm still somewhat in the dark on this matter! But as the book progressed, so it got a little better. There was much to read about the Anthropic Principle, which I found very interesting. Barrow also addressed the question of whether the constants are actually constant or whether they have changed (or are changing) with time, and here he introduced some of his own research. I learnt a lot from this book. Nevertheless, overall I'm not convinced that the author has really done justice to the subject in the title, ""The Constants of Nature"", because I don't think it ever fully recovers from what I found was a challenging start. Also, for me, Barrow made too many assumptions about my prior knowledge of this subject so I struggled to understand many of the points he was making. This is not a book for the faint-hearted."

4,1400032253,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6743601-jim-fonseca,4,"Let's start with what this book is not about. It's not about mathematical constants such as pi and little e, the natural logarithm. It is about constants of physics such as Planck's constant, the speed of light and the gravitational constant. The book is primarily about cosmology focused around the question, is the universe expanding or contracting? What happens to these physical constants in these cases; are they the same everywhere in the universe at all times and in all places, or can they vary based on expansion and contraction of the universe? If its expansion is slowing, will it eventually stop and re-implode, perhaps leading to another Big Bang? On the other hand, if the universe is expanding, as it appears to be, and if it is expanding at an increasing rate, what will happen? Since you are reading this review, you have had at least college math and that is generally sufficient to understand and to enjoy this book. It is not heavy math; the reading level is more like Discovery Magazine or Scientific American. An exception is the last section where the author explores new territory, apparently his own research, and the math gets difficult for the ordinary reader. Because constants might indeed vary over space or over time, it is fascinating how little they can vary, at least based on the ranges we know of in the known universe. But how do we truly know? "
5,1400032253,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17920211-tuomas,3,"Constants are a topic that interests me greatly, since I've written about them in my own philosophical work. Barrow is the first-hand authority on the topic, given his involvement in the team that found possible variation of the fine-structure constant via observation of quasars. So I was excited to finally read this book, even though it's over a decade old now. And it is a good book: very catchy writing and nice anecdotes. However, for someone who already knew much of the relevant data, this was a little too ""popular"". The punch line came very late in the book and the speculation that followed was a bit fluffy. While I'd recommend the book to those who don't know much about the topic yet, it's perhaps not the best source of further information even for interested amateurs like myself."
6,1400032253,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33441404-amol-kate,4,"It’s a fantastic book on constants and what they are? We all have knew about constant values in science like constant of gravity, speed of light. We have consider these values are never change anywhere. How scientist find out these values Barrow discussed all about in this book. Barrow is great story teller of difficult subjects in sciences. He started book from the human quest of measuring thing and make measurement standard for all. He tells about how different standard units like pound, kilogram came into use. In further chapters he narrates how these standards are very limited in use. For measuring electron we required some other units obviously one can convert these units from one to another but different things required different ways of measuring. He also discussed about reality of numbers of constants. Do these constants are always constants or they are also changing. What kind of fate our universe will have in changing constant criteria and steady constant criteria. Book is content with historical events, Science philosophy and scientific information. Anyone who is slightly interested in science can read this book."
7,1400032253,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19982554-suyog-garg,2,"The book certainly is written after extensive research on the topic and the author been an University Professor is aptly one of the best to refer on the topic. The writing style, words and sentence structure are also well suited for the kind of popular science book like this. The reason of two stars is that although the book is certainly a good read on the topics like Cosmological constants, multiverse, big band, extra dimensions etc., it isn’t what the misleading subtitle ‘From alpha to omega’ promises. When I bought this book I had anticipated a history of origin, usage, numerical value, significance and discussion on the constancy of constants like pi, golden ratio, e, Planck constant among many other. What I had not envisaged was chapters similar to numerous other book for instance penned by Brian Greene etc. All in all, I would say the verdict is that you gonna love the book if you are a bit philosophically inclined."
8,1400032253,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8355999-betsy,1,I have an undergraduate degree in Physics and Chemistry and graduate degrees in Computer Science and mathematics but this book defeated me. The author seemed to be attempting to identify dimensionless quantities from which all physical constants could be derived. At some point he stepped off into something that began to sound a lot like numerology. He appeared to be drawing some kind of mystical connection between the magnitudes of some of these constants. I could make very little sense of this book even after going back to the beginning and starting over. I finally gave up part way through it. 
9,1400032253,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58127609-rod-innis,3,An interesting book. The author talks about the fine tuning of the universe and yet seems to reject a tuner.

15,1400032253,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23888196-rama,5,"Changing Constantsn order to explain physical reality, physicists measure and determine physical quantities/parameters/information related to the object/subject in question using well defined laws such as; the laws of classical physics (theory relativity), quantum mechanics, and thermodynamics. Physicists do not know the details of all the laws, and their interpretations/explanations often vary, but the physical laws themselves are the same across the universe. Einstein's principle of covariance states that laws of nature should appear the same for all observers in the universe no matter where they are located or how they are moving. The equations and the fundamental constants that write these laws are universal, but as physicists try to explain how the universe works, it is increasingly becoming apparent to a few physicists that some fundamental constants such as the speed of light (c), fine-structure constant, proton-electron mass ratio, and gravity (G) have changed over the last 13.7 billion light years. The author chronicles the historical development in the physics research of universal constant and touches upon the most fundamental part of creation. How do these constants that are a part of an equation could have impacted a functional universe that supports life? Mathematician Ramanujan once said that ""An equation has no meaning unless it expresses the thought of God."" The dimensionless constant is certainly the thought of God. Time variation of fundamental constants is subjected to theoretical and experimental research by a number of physicists such as; Arthur Eddington, Paul Dirac, George Gamow, Robert Dicke, Brendan Carter and others. The fine-structure constant was originally introduced in 1916 by Arnold Sommerfeld, as a measure of the relativistic deviations in atomic spectral lines of the Bohr's atomic model. This constsnt is interpreted as a measure of electromagnetic force that holds the atoms together or the strength of the interaction between electrons and photons; the ratio of two energies, the energy needed to bring two electrons from infinity to a distance against their electrostatic repulsion, and the energy of a single photon. It is also defined as the ratio of the strengths of the electromagnetic and gravitational interactions. This constant is a dimensionless quantity (1/137.035999679); hence its numerical value is independent of the system of units used. Many physicists have wondered why God would have created such an odd number for this constant (value of Pi is another example.) One explanation is the cosmological evolution of a quintessence-like scalar field coupled to gauge fields and matter would have effectively modified the coupling constants and particle masses over time. However, the anthropic principle states that the value of the fine-structure is what it is because stable matter could not have existed in the universe if that was any other number. In other words, galaxies, stars, planetary systems and life forms would not have evolved. For instance, if this constsnt was changed by 4%, carbon and oxygen would not have been produced in stars. Since fine-structure constant is present wherever electromagnetism is, it is determined by various methods from atomic spectra. One is by analyzing the atomic spectra of distant galaxies and stars. The second one is the natural reactor of Oklo has been used to check if the atomic fine-structure constant might have changed over the past 2 billion years. That is because it influences the rate of nuclear reactions. For example, Samarium(149) captures a neutron to become Samarium(150), and since the rate of neutron capture depends on the value of this constant, the ratio of the two samarium isotopes in samples from Oklo can be used to calculate the value of this constant that existed 2 billion years ago. The results are conflicting and it is not clear if these constant are changing. Despite the fact that this book has many irrelevant quotations from unorthodox figures such as; Joan Rivers, Woody Allen, Brooke Shields, W.C. Fields, and George Bush, it is highly recommended. "
16,1400032253,http://goodreads.com/user/show/83932316-zofia-m-jdzin,4,One of the books full of mysteries that I totally don't understand (but still enjoy reading about) :)
17,1400032253,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4696922-ushan,3,"Despite the title, the book is mostly about just one constant. Take two electrons very far apart; bringing them to distance d of each other takes work that is proportional to 1/d. Now take a photon with frequency 1/d; its energy is also proportional to 1/d. Dividing the two coefficients of proportionality produces the fine structure constant, 1/137.035999074(44). This is the strength of the electromagnetic interaction, a fundamental force of nature. There is a caveat: quantum field theory says that an electron is surrounded by a cloud of virtual pairs of charged particles that screen its charge; the less the screening, the bigger the effective charge; so at energies near 80 GeV the effective constant is about 1/128. Where did the number 1/137... come from? Nobody knows. Since the constant was introduced in 1916, physicists have been trying to reduce it to a simple mathematical expression; they have failed. Was it ever different? Because U-235 decays faster than U-238, the proportion of U-235 in natural uranium was higher billions of years ago; some 2 billion years ago in Africa, an underground stream washing through uranium ore started a chain reaction; nowadays you need either heavy water or enriched uranium. A young Soviet nuclear physicist knew that the neutron capture rate of a certain decay product isotope depends very sensitively on the fine structure constant; he realized that by measuring the abundance of the isotope in the African ore, one could check whether 2 billion years ago the value of the constant was measurably different. It wasn't. Astronomers have looked into the spectra of quasars billions of light-years away; when their light was emitted billions of years ago, the value of the fine structure constant seems to have been the same as now. It has been reported that the value of the constant was very slightly different billions of years ago in different parts of the sky, but this is an extraordinary claim, and extraordinary evidence for it hasn't yet been produced.Now, if the value of the fine structure constant had differed by only a few percent, synthesis of carbon from helium in red giants would not take place, and carbon-based life such as humans wouldn't exist. This fact is picked up by modern creationists, though thankfully not the author himself, who claim that the universe was created for humans: ""He gave us eyes to see them, And lips that we might tell, How great is God Almighty, Who has made all things well."" The fact is that no one has any idea, where the fine structure constant came from, whether it could have been any different, and if it could, what process generated it, and where the parameters for that process came from. There are also fundamental constants for which this is not true. The muon is an elementary particle similar to the electron, but 207 times heavier. No one knows where that number came from either, but as far as I know, it could have been significantly different with no consequences for life on Earth."
18,1400032253,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4472406-hollowman,1,"This review will be in draft mode for a while.I actually got this book way back in 2002 when it was first pub'd. What a confusing mess!I haven't read any of Barrows' other books, so I can't say whether he can't (IMO) write clear books in general or whether the lack of clarity is an issue with Constants...In the first chapter -- heck, even in the Preface -- the author should LIST off (bullet, number, letter, etc.) the Constants (symbol and all) followed by a one- or two-sentence description. Next, and to a lesser degree perhaps, one chapter should be dedicated to each Constant.Finally, a Glossary should be provided with brief definitions for each constant.That's the LEAST an author needs to do to treat a topic as important and potentially complex as ""the Constants of Nature"".Barrow has done none of that ... this book was frustrating!If you go thru some of Barrow's YouTube videos and articles in New Scientist, you'll note that he's not really a bad communicator. The video lectures are clear and structured and worth watching. The same clarity needs to given to a topic as important as the Constants of Nature ... not sure this book will ever be revised ... but all we need is someone to dedicate a Blog or Wiki article to the topic. Books are kinda inconvenient nowadays anyway.==== EDIT UPDATES BELOW ====This 2013 ScienceBlogs post is kinda what I had in mind (it lists 26)...http://scienceblogs.com/startswithaba...This may also help ...http://einsteinsintuition.com/what-is...In 2007, the Journal NATURE reported:Physicists whittle down the number of truly fundamental constants.""How many physical constants does it take to describe the Universe? The answer, according to a team of physicists in Brazil, is just two.The two can be chosen, according to taste, from a list of three: the speed of light, the strength of gravity, and Planck’s constant, which relates the energy to the frequency of a particle of light, say George Matsas of the São Paulo State University and his colleagues.Once two constants have been chosen from that list, they say, those are the only parameters that need have units of measurement ascribed to them. Everything else — for example, the charge or the mass of an electron, or the strength of nuclear forces — can be described in relation to these two 'dimensional' constants.""More here:http://www.nature.com/news/2007/07122..."
19,1400032253,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6949571-thomas-paul,2,"There is a good book in this book somewhere, but it is trapped inside of a fair book that promises a lot more than it actually delivers. There is an initial problem that the book fails to make the case as to why particular constants are important. When discussing the fine structure constant (which is really the only constant that is given any significant coverage), the author tells us that it is made up of a combination of the electron charge, the speed of light, and Plank's constant. One might ask why these three particular values and that would be a fair question. The author tells us that if these three values changed but the fine structure constant remained the same, the resulting universe would be indistinguishable from our own. And then he leaves it there. What does that mean? Why is this the case? The author skips over this and moves on to other topics. He also makes a claim for ""natural units"" without being clear about what he means and why they are particularly natural.In chapter six the author discusses some curious coincidences surrounding Eddington's number. But after having debunked some other coincidental numbers he seems to leave himself open to claims that he is simply invoking meaningless coincidences. For example, he lays claim to an odd coincidence between the number of protons in the Universe and the ratio of the strengths of the electromagnetic and gravitational forces between two protons. Why these particular numbers? There are some interesting twists and turns in the book but there are also enough things that seem rather shaky that I began to doubt how much of the book was truly reliable. As one reviewer has already pointed out, what does one say when a book is so careless as to claim that solar eclipses are caused by the Earth's shadow falling on the Sun? I am sure the author doesn't believe that to be the case but it shows a certain amount of carelessness that worries me about the remainder of the book.There are some good parts to the book that I should mention. The discussion of the Anthropic Principle was clear and concise. His explanation of why intelligent life could not evolve unless there were exactly three spatial dimensions and one time dimension was convincing although I would have liked him to expand on this in more depth. Chapter eleven's discussion of natural nuclear reactors was also quite interesting. Overall there are some good parts in here but I didn't find the book as a whole delivered on its promise."

That said, it did cover a range of interesting topics in Physics and was broken up with some funny and quirky quotes by famous authors, scientists, etc. which was a nice touch. The book probably could have been condensed to half the size, but I can understand why it wasn't - you'd probably lose the friendly tone and extra snippets of insight and humour that the author put in, which although didn't add anything in terms of knowledge, made the book more enjoyable to read."
