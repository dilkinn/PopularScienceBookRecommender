0,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67532575-kevin-shepherd,5,"""Belief in god depends on religious faith. Acceptance of evolution depends on empirical evidence. This is the fundamental difference between religion and science. If you attempt to reconcile and combine religion and science on questions about nature and the universe, and if you push the science to its logical conclusion, you will end up naturalizing the deity; for any question about nature, if your answer is ""God did it,"" a scientist will ask such questions as ""How did god do it? What forces did god use? What forms of matter and energy were employed in the creation process?"" The end result can only be natural explanations for all natural phenomena."" (pg 123)Michael Shumer is meticulous, thorough, and articulate. He first exposes the evangelical ""Intelligent Design"" philosophy for what it really is, then proceeds to dismantle it, brick by brick. Shumer writes about the not-so-hidden agenda of ID legislation and litigators, points out the flaws and falsehoods at its foundation, then proposes real world solutions - constructive fact-based solutions. In spite of what some other reviewers have written, this is not an attack on faith, it's a stand against the idiocy of theocrats and sanctimonious blowhards. Roll on Michael Shermer, roll on."
1,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1713956-manny,3,"[Original review, Jan 2010]The bit I liked best in this book was his categorisation of the different shades of belief in the Intelligent Design/Creationism spectrum. I hadn't understood that there was such a lot of variety; points of view range from the straightforwardly loopy (the world was created in 4004 B.C. and there were dinosaurs on the Ark) to the very subtle (evolution happened, and so did the Big Bang, but God started the ball rolling), with plenty in between.As you can see, I have no sympathy for one end of this continuum, but I don't see any clear arguments at the other extreme. My summary would be, simply, that no one knows. If the ID people moved further to the right and acknowledged the indisputable facts while sensibly debating the things that really are unclear, I might have to start taking them seriously. So far, though, I don't see any obvious signs of that happening.______________________________________[Update, Apr 2010]I posted a review of The Ancestor's Tale earlier this morning, and within minutes was in the middle of another argument about Intelligent Design. For the record, here are my top objections to mainstream ID:1. It shouldn't make a difference to a theory what specific labels you use for the key concepts. Quantum chromodynamics would be just as respectable if you replaced ""red"", ""blue"" and ""green"" with ""sweet"", ""sour"" and ""salty"". They're just names. ID doesn't sound too bad if you say ""God created the different species"" or ""Some higher intelligence did it"". But if you paraphrase the theory as ""Very long-lived, technologically advanced aliens have been messing with the DNA for the last several hundred million years"", then people who like ID get all upset. Why? It seems to me that this is already a serious warning sign.2. It's bad science, because it doesn't make any testable predictions. Or, to put it another way, proponents of ID refuse to put their money where their mouth is. They won't come out and name any specific thing we can check, that would be turn out to be true if their theory were correct.How seriously would you take an investment analyst who never actually recommended that you buy or sell a particular stock? People get a reputation for being good because they've called it right enough times. 3. It's disrespectful to God. I don't myself believe in God - but, if I did, I would like to take seriously the idea that He is all-powerful. So I wouldn't much appreciate arguments along the lines of ""Having thought about it for several minutes, I don't see how the human eye could have evolved by natural selection, so it must have been designed"". To me, the truly impressive demonstration of God's power would be to have been able to set things up so cleverly that the eye arose as a consequence of natural selection among creatures who initially didn't have eyes. I freely admit that I don't understand all the details. But it seems incredibly presumptuous to say that, just because my mortal mind is having a bit of trouble grasping this particular piece of the sequence, then it couldn't have happened. I think that this is a serious misreading of what the word ""omnipotent"" means.I often have to review papers on computational linguistics and language engineering, and the ones I'm most impressed with are those in which some apparently simple idea turns out to have many subtle and unexpected consequences. I'm less thrilled by the ones where the author keeps having to invent special-purpose hacks to take care of every little problem. It seems to me that the ID people are saying that God couldn't come up with any clean, elegant way to create life because it was too technically demanding, so He had to resort to a bunch of special-purpose hacks. Guys, I hate to be the one to point it out to you, but that's called blasphemy.______________________________________[Update, Nov 2014]I discover, on reading Hume's Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding, that he expressed the above thought over two hundred years ago in a rather more elegant way. It is particularly impressive that he did so before the concept of evolution had even been discovered:It surely argues more power in the Deity to delegate a certain degree of power to inferior creatures than to produce every thing by his own immediate volition. It argues more wisdom to contrive at first the fabric of the world with such perfect foresight that, of itself, and by its proper operation, it may serve all the purposes of Providence, than if the great Creator were obliged at every moment to adjust its parts, and animate by his breath all the wheels of that stupendous machine."
2,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3112-scott-lerch,5,Excellent short and concise explanation of why creationism/ID is crap and dangerous to teach as even close to real science.
3,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13151041-manish-sinha,4,"This is probably one of the finest books to pick up, in case you were confused about Creationism or Intelligent Design controversy. It’s not as much of a controversy in the scientific world as we are taught, but we all know controversies can be manufactured and the biggest victim of this manufactured controversy is Darwin’s theory of Evolution by Natural Selection.The Author Michael Shermer is former self-declared creationist who spent a big deal of his young adult life enthusiastically spreading creationism. Later in his life he saw reason and realized that the creationism movement was not portraying evolution correctly. Having been in that movement, he understands how creationists and Intelligent Design (ID)advocates think and push their agenda.One of the great things of this book was the way he explained how our body is not exactly intelligently designed because it evolved through natural selection which isn’t intelligent. He mentioned a few of them: male nipples, male uterus, anomalous thirteen ribs, tail bone, wisdom teeth, appendix, body hair, goosebumps etc. All these are remnants of our ancestral apes and since existence of any of these doesn’t affect our survival rate, these traits don’t get extinct.Shermer provided a very simple explanation why people don’t accept Evolution. It feels too simplified, but given that most of evolution denial is religiously motivated, it’s not a broad generalizationThis [morality] is what bothers people aboutevolution theory, not the technical detailsof the science. Most folks don’t give onewhit about adaptive radiation,allopathic speciation, [….] punctured equilibrium and the like. What they docare is about whether teaching evolutionwill make their kids reject God, allowscriminals and sinners to blame theirgenes for their actions and generallycause society to fall apart.There is a pretty good explanation of the Scopes trial and in general pretty un-intelligent movement called “Intelligent Design”. The members of ID would claim in court that their theory [sic] has nothing to do with religion and outside the court they would profess their love for God and link ID with God without caring that their statements are being recorded in public. It would be surprising if such people who are anything but intelligent cant come up with the Intelligent Design explanation of existence of life.The fruitless debatesShermer explains how Creationism/ID vs Evolution debates are kind of fruitless because one relies on faith whereas other relies on evidence. Even though it is fruitless, refusal to take up the debate challenge can be seen as weak of insecurity of the scientists. The goal of the debates are to target the fence sitters as the hardcore creationists won’t change their mind as they consider their unmoved faith as a virtue and there is no point in targeting the scientific minded people as it would be preaching to the choir.Either-Or-FallacyShermer goes on the explain another fallacy of the ID movement (as there is a shortage of fallacies) where they consider only two explanation — evolution or ID. If science is not able to explain something, then it is an implicit proof that ID is right. The fallacy lies in the fact that there can be more than two answers for a question. Another fallacy which Shermer didn’t emphasize enough is that ID needs to explicitly prove it’s validity. Lack of scientific explanation doesn’t automatically make ID valid. This fallacy is also known to us as Gods of the Gaps.Science disproving religionThis was probably the most important chapter of the book. Sherman provides three models in which science and religion can exist* Conflicting world model: A model where findings of science are considered a threat to religion and the ideas of religion are considered dangerous to science. It is a model in which “evidence” clashes with “faith”.* Same-world model: A model which holds that science and religion are two ways of observing the world* Separate-World model: In this model, science and religion are not compatible or mutually exclusive, but serve different purposes. It explains how religion takes care of emotions, friendship, societies whereas science takes care of knowing the world.Shermer left this question mostly unanswered without providing any solid hint if he choses any of these models. If I had to choose, my bet would be on Seperate World model. It is useless and waste of time to explain people why religion does not explain the world. Religion has been used as a shield for horrible things in the past, but if we can channel belief into something constructive, then it should be a much sought after option.I would not buy the argument that science and religion can coexist for the same topic. If take for example — origin of life. Science has made it very clear that the answer to our best of knowledge is Evolution by Natural Selection (along with Artificial Selection). What about stars? In this case, we have two answers provided by each — The gas cloud collapsing on itself, which is provided by science and “God/Designer did it” by Creationism/ID. In this case, I would have to choose evidence over faith.Science does not deal with all the things which religion deals with. Morality, for example is something which we humans accept as a part of the culture which has very little to do with science. Some religious people claim that morals come from God/scriptures whereas other people who disagree with that claim don’t say “It comes from science”. Science is currently absent from the field of morality. In case you think science should have an answer, then you should read The Moral Landscape: How Science Can Determine Human Values by “Sam Harris” where he claims that science can answer moral questions, even though admitting his ideology isn’t complete and needs more work to even qualify as any kind of scientific theory."
4,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47975-robu-sensei,3," Why Darwin Matters, by well-known skeptic author Michael Shermer, is an excellent introduction to the science, and lack thereof, behind the ""controversy"" between evolution and ""Intelligent Design"" (ID) creationism that has jeopardized science education in the USA. Those who are seeking an in-depth criticism of current ID arguments, however, will find this book lacking in particulars.Shermer begins with a concise survey of what evolution really is, and masterfully sets the historical stage in which evolution is pitted against Christian fundamentalism. He accurately pinpoints the major logical fallacies characteristic of ID creationists' arguments, and briefly surveys the ""best"" arguments put forth in favor of ID, touching on the flaws in each. Finally, he reveals some disturbing facts about the true motives of the ID movement. All in all, the book is beautifully organized and extremely well written.Nonetheless, it is not until the Coda—after the Epilogue—that Shermer drives home the central argument against ID, that it is scientifically vacuous: ""The problem with the supernatural explanations of Intelligent Design is that there is nothing we can do with supernatural explanations. They lead to no data collection, no testable hypotheses, no quantifiable theories: therefore, no science."" Moreover, Shermer does an admirable job explaining the key role of evolution in modern biology, yet somehow fails to mention its enormous potential to improve human health, as geneticists and molecular biologists have already begun to unravel the secrets of the human genome, drawing crucial information from the genomes of the chimpanzee and other animals. To the average American, that's why Darwin matters.The battle-hardened scientist or science teacher already embroiled in the ""controversy"" will learn little from  Why Darwin Matters—but will still enjoy reading it. And for any up-and-coming defender of science, this book makes a perfect springboard from which to explore the politico-religious phenomenon of ID in greater depth."
5,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/875001-corinne-edwards,4,"I have come to the conclusion that the subtitle should actually be the title of this book. Sometimes I felt like I was in court and Intelligent Design was the defendant - Shermer's purpose was to lay down the facts regarding evolution is such a way as to explain why Intelligent Design is a scientific impossibility. Or, the fact that, in his opinion, Intelligent Design is not scientific at all.I rarely read books that are so thoroughly scientific. I'm not going to lie: sometimes I had to skim over the most in-depth parts about RNA and mitochondria and the more nitty gritty aspects of evolutionary theory. But there was much that was interesting about studies that have been done and anecdotal stories about evolutionary science - these were very accessibly written. I feel like I now have a sense for what both sides of the Evolution vs. Intelligent Design debate assert and that I'm more able to have an informed discussion about the topic.I liked how the book was set-up, the chapter headings and sub-headings really guided my reading and often answered questions that came up as I read, especially this: is it possible to reconcile a faith in God as a supreme being/creator and knowledge of evolutionary theory? He goes into this in depth, obviously, as he separates the theory of evolution from theological discourse. I appreciated that he acknowledged that yes, it is totally possible to be reconciled to both - but I also felt, and this bothered me, that he tended to be condescending regarding those who DID believe in Intelligent Design. Actually, the whole tone of the book felt a bit condescending to me - and even though he presents an excellent case and I don't even disagree with his point - I just wish he'd been less patronizing.This book got me thinking, that's for sure. I can't pretend this is the perfect summer beach read or that everyone will want to pick it up, but it helped me use my brain for a while, got me to sort through how I feel about a multitude of issues and for the most part, it did entertain me. So, take from that what you will. "
6,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1339246-gendou,5,"This book doesn't go into the medical, biological, and zoological importance of Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection. It exposes the ""Intelligent Design"" movement as nothing more than non-scientific Creationism dressed up in a bed sheet like a Scooby-Doo ghost."
7,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27781063-dyary-abubakr,3,"“Darwin matters because evolution matters. Evolution matters because science matters. Science matters because it is the preeminent story of our age, an epic saga about who we are, where we came from, and where we are going.”"
8,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5686119-book,4,"Why Darwin Matters: The Case against Intelligent Design by Michael Shermer Why Darwin Matters is a solid, very accessible, concise book that refutes Intelligent Design (ID). It also provides lucid arguments in support of evolution. The book is composed of the following nine chapters: The Facts of Evolution, Why People Do Not Accept Evolution, In Search of the Designer, Debating Intelligent Design, Science Under Attack, The Real Agenda, Why Science Cannot Contradict Religion, Why Christians and Conservatives Should Accept Evolution, The Real Unsolved Problems in Evolution and a very interesting Appendix . Positives: 1. One of the main reasons Michael Shermer is a very good author is because he understands his audience. He understands that this book is intended for the masses and he succeeds at providing the masses what it needs. A clear understanding of Why Darwin in fact matters and the facts about evolution, in an accessible manner. 2. Mr. Shermer is also a very likeable and intelligent man and this comes through in his writing style which is straight forward, easy to follow yet profound. It's the perfect gift for someone who wants to know the facts from fiction regarding evolution and ID. 3. It clearly shows why ID is not science by going over their arguments. 4. Explains to the layman what constitutes scientific work. 5. The concept of convergence of independent lines of evidence leads to the very compelling and single conclusion, that life evolved. 6. Love the use of lists throughout the book, such as: vestigial structures, reasons why people resist the truth of evolutionary theory, seven strongest predictors of belief in God, reasons to engage in the debate between evolution and ID, arguments for ID, six cosmic numbers of the Anthropic Principle, ten ""icons"" of evolution, 7. Mr. Shermer knows how to get to the point and does a wonderful job with lists and other interesting tidbits. So much is covered succinctly in less than 225 pages. 8. A good section on science under attack and a discussion on important court cases. 9. The truth behind the people behind the ID movement and their ultimate agenda. 10. An interesting chapter on what the real unsolved problems in evolution truly are. 11. A truly enjoyable introduction to evolution written in an accessible manner for all levels to enjoy. 12. Extensive notes and the links work well. Negatives: 1. Not as technical as other books on the topic but provides great references for those who want to dig deeper. 2. Table of contents work fine but you can't access it from the menu. 3. I think the weakest part of the book is when Mr. Shermer tries to extend an olive branch of sorts to believers ""Evolution makes for good theology."" Didn't really buy this argument. You can't allow faith to get in the way of the facts, no matter what they are. In summary, this book is another great addition to my evolutionary collection. I also recommend the following books on evolution: ""Why Evolution Is True"" by Jerry Coyne (my favorite book on this topic), ""Your Inner Fish..."" by Neil Shubin, ""The Making of the Fittest"" by Sean B. Carroll, ""What Evolution Is"" by Ernst Mayr, ""Life Ascending: The Ten Great Inventions of Evolution"" by Nick Lane and of course you have your pick of books from the master Richard Dawkins his most recent book on evolution is ""The Greatest Show on Earth"". "
9,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7324264-john,5,"In ""Why Darwin Matters: The Case Against Intelligent Design"" Michael Shermer, publisher of Skeptic magazine, reviews succinctly both the overwhelming evidence in support of contemporary evolutionary theory and the pseudoscientific religious nonsense known as Intelligent Design, and then, discusses ""the real, unsolved problems in evolution"". Shermer, for example, has ample space to describe briefly Ernst Mayr's theory of allopatric speciation, and its relationship to punctuated equilibrium, the evolutionary paleontological theory developed by American invertebrate paleontologists Niles Eldredge and Stephen Jay Gould. But he also devotes ample space to dissecting Intelligent Design concepts like William Dembski's ""Law of Conservation of Information"", noting its irrelevance to both current mathematical information theory and the transfer and accretion of information - via DNA - in living biological systems. He offers an elegant overview of the origins and history of the so-called ""Evolution vs. Intelligent Design Debate"", devoting ample time to the existence of the infamous ""Wedge Document"" and the trial proceedings of the Kitzmiller vs. Dover trial and, of course, the harsh verdict rendered by Federal Judge John E. Jones III against both Intelligent Design and the Dover Area School District board. Shermer's terse tome is noteworthy for several reasons. First, he recognizes the necessity for engaging Intelligent Design advocates like Michael Behe and William Dembski, among others, in debates between themselves and knowledgeable critics on behalf of genuine science like Shermer, if only to educate public audiences on the nature of scientific inquiry, the ample facts obtained from genuine scientific research, and the disingenuous lies, half-truths, and omissions promoted zealously by Intelligent Design advocates. Second, he makes a most persuasive case explaining why evolution ought to be accepted by conservatives, as the agent ultimately responsible for the origins of morality in humans, and that ""survival of the fittest"" could be seen as a biological application of Adam Smith's concept of laissez faire free market economics. Last, but not least, Shermer contends that science should be viewed as being complementary towards spirituality, by engendering a ""sense of awe"" in viewing, for example, distant galaxies; therefore evolution can and should be seen in this very light. For these reasons, Shermer's terse tome deserves a place on the bookshelves of as wide a readership as possible. (Reposted from my 2008 Amazon review)"
10,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3023305-pankaj-singh,5,"A brilliant and detailed, albeit a bit short discussion of the evolution vs creationism/ID debate. Shermer is extremely respectful towards the creationists, but still firm enough when demonstrating how wrong they are. The longest chapter in this book gives space to the ID arguments. Shermer describes in detail what ID proponents claim, and then tears each argument down beautifully. Of course, a book on a topic like this is bound to attract creationists who just love one starring. The funniest reason I read for disliking this book was "" Shermer quotes himself"". Well, if you have published tons of books and papers, you have the right to quote yourself. I just feel sorry for all the people who dismiss evolution before understanding it. As Shermer points out, by claiming God conjured humans like a cheap magic trick, one takes away credit from God. Creationism and intelligent design are not just terrible science, they are bad theology."
11,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5963979-jim-razinha,4,"Excellent book, well-documented, well-reasoned and goes on the ""must read"" list for our homeschoolers, if only to learn from Shermer in how to frame and refute the arguments.It's not a long read, and covers much material previously published, but I like that Shermer is willing to engage the purveyors of non-science, for while I agree with Dawkins et al that engaging in debate legitimizes what is absurd, someone needs to cogently demonstrate such absurdity. He does a good job explaining why science cannot disprove religion but also how religion cannot conscript science to support its aims, for science easily disproves such attempts if that door is opened.."

Recommended. I have read other books by Shermer who write technical subjects with interest and clarity.
14,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9098678-scott-holstad,5,"This book isn't necessarily tremendously original, but it IS pretty good in that good arguments are made, facts are laid out, idiocies are exposed -- again -- and thus it's one more nail in the coffin of religion and most especially Abrahaminic theism, particularly as practised by most Christians (and especially evangelicals and fundies in America). Having grown up in that tradition, being steeped in it, having played leadership roles, been a missionary, was Billy Graham's youngest counselor, went to a Presbyterian college, etc., I know full well how Christians neither know their holy book nor take it seriously, as all of them cherry pick out what's most convenient to support their own personal beliefs while trashing the rest of it as merely a product of its times and no longer relevant, or worse yet, don't have the foggiest clue about most things in that book, such as which of the two creation stories in Genesis to believe, how Moses was able to write about and vividly describe his own death, where he was buried, etc., how the two gospel genealogies literally don't match up at all, and it's basically irrelevant anyway as the Messiah was supposed to come from the line of David and Jews count their lineage through their mothers, not their fathers, which is still even more irrelevant because even if Joseph had descended from the line of David, he was NOT the blood father of Jesus -- no human was (assuming the Christian Jesus even existed, for which there's no first century independent proof, records, anything at all), and one wonders if Joseph even existed at all (if any of them did) as once the babe was born, he basically disappears from the text and is never seen again, four totally different resurrection stories, etc. And on and on. I don't need to write a book; plenty enough have already been written. So, the concept of ""intelligent design"" is a hilarious fraud masquerading as ""science,"" although virtually no actual, real scientists acknowledge it as legitimate since it doesn't stand up to the scientific method, among many other reasons, and thus back to Darwin. Again, not the first or best book on the subject, but not bad and again, just another nail in the coffin of a failed and inhumane prehistoric myth. Recommended."
15,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17709230-winston-jen,5,"Why Facts MatterWhy Darwin Matters is an immensely readable book about a very complicated and crucial subject: evolution. Beginning with Shermer's account of an archaeological dig for fossils and a description of how the Earth is most certainly NOT fined tuned for life. Even if we disregard the array of predators that would sooner make a meal of us than be our companions in life, the environment itself is hostile to human breeding, let alone flourishing. Unintelligent design is also rampant and obvious even after a cursory analysis. The appendix, male nipples and the remnants of a uterus in men are just three.Evolution is the most well-supported scientific fact. There is a larger body of evidence vindicating it than there is to show that gravity is true (which should tell readers something).Chapter 2 details the Scopes Monkey Trial, and how opposition against the theory of evolution is primarily based on a fear that evolution will lead to agnosticism, then atheism and hence a total moral vacuum. The surfeit of theistic evolutionists is testament against this lie.They equate Darwinism with the Nazi ""Ubermensch"" regime, ignoring the fact that the Nazis believed in eugenics, a philosophy based on arrogance, racism and prejudice. Evolution, on the other hand, is based on facts, observation, experiments and testing. Sadly, Brian, the main antagonist against science, was not permitted to give his closing statements, but they are available online. A 90-minute documentary was also made on the subject.Shermer follows the voluminous paper trail left by the Intelligent Design lobbyists. All of them, save one (a disciple of Reverend Moon) is an evangelical Christian. As they are so well-funded, organised and willing to waste so much time and taxpayer resources to force the lies of the ID movement into public schools, it is imperative that citizens concerned for the truth stand up and work against them. Teachers should be teaching proven scientific facts, not preaching from a state-funded pulpit through the intimidation of authority.I am grateful to Shermer for following the facts where they led him, and not starting from an assumed and impervious conclusion before setting out on this didactic quest for knowledge and elucidation."
16,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/237286-jeff,5,"This is a nice introduction to the whole evolution/Intelligent Design ""debate"" and a nice introduction to the science and implications of biological evolution. I put debate in quotes because, after having had numerous discussions with Creationists and after having read substantial amounts of ID material, it is obvious that IDers/Creationists are not interested in rational debate; rather, they hold a faith-based position that they think is right, regardless of evidence...evidence which many discount out of hand as being fabricated by materialistic humanists (i.e., people like me).For IDers, their beliefs are little more than the use of the language of science as a Potemkin Village for Creationism. Those assertions that are testable - like the idea have of irreducible complexity - have been shown to be at odds with well known data. Those that are not - like the notion that because the universe exists in a fashion allowing our form of life to exist there must be a designer who wanted us to exist - are just not germane to a discussion within the bounds of science.You definitely would not want this book to be your only source of knowledge on evolution; it really is an introduction to the current attempt by religious elements in our society to destroy science and secular institutions and modes of thought (or godless materialistic humanism, if you wish). But it is a very good place to start.Schermer is a very, accessible writer and the book is short enough to be read in an afternoon. It is jargon light, so anyone should be able to pick this up and understand everything Schermer is writing about. Check it out. "
17,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/208893-kim-olson,4,"Once an evangelical Christian, Michael Shermer made the journey from creationist to evolutionist, as did Darwin himself, when his foray into the natural sciences left him overwhelmed by evidence of evolution. In this book, Shermer (now the publisher of Skeptic magazine) details several specific arguments made by those who believe in Intelligent Design (such as the belief that only micro- and not macro-evolution occurs). Then, one by one, he shows how each of these arguments fall apart at the most crucial point. In each case, he then provides the explanation provided by science/evolution. He sheds light on how little those who champion Intelligent Design (many of whom are influencing textbook content) seem to understand about even something as basic as the scientific method or the definition of ""theory"" in science.After discrediting Intelligent Design, Shermer goes on to make one of the more elegant arguments I've heard about how one can both accept evolution and a creator (although not Intelligent Design), as many do. He makes attempts to explain why one might, but of course, must abandon intellectual rigor at this point. Still, the argument is eloquent and he does resolve the conflict. Proving the existence of gods, of course, is another matter, but that isn't his task."
18,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4837743-halden,2,"I am normally a fan of Michael Shermer’s mixture of wit and wisdom but Why Darwin Matters just fell a little flat for me. The book is well written and full of facts and wry wit but I found it read like a primer, only useful for those about to debate a proponent of Intelligent Design (ID). Now this maybe the goal of the book and if it is then it has accomplished it, but I was looking for more and this may have been where I went wrong.The book goes over the basics of evolution and of the advances made in biology since Darwin, which was interesting but not very in depth. Much of the text is spent educating the reader on the history of Creationism, ID and the legal battles in the US to get them taught as alternatives to Evolution. The focus on US court battles is where Shermer begins to lose me, I care to learn about the science but the legal battles, not so much. Once again I am probably falling victiim to not being the core audience for this book.Why Darwin Matters is a good book and I am sure it will find a receptive audience amongst American skeptics and freethinkers but I fear that it’s narrow look at evolution left me out of the loop and hoping for more."
19,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5869795-steve-mitchell,5,"This has now become one of my favourite science books. Shermer systematically takes all the arguments thrown at evolution by creationists and believers in intelligent design – or creationists to give them their proper name – and demonstrates the lack of science and the jargon used to blur the issue. Contrary to the popular belief of people like Ann Coulter, Darwinian evolution has withstood every criticism that has ever been thrown at it and is a robust scientific theory. Intelligent design is a nonsense attempt to get Biblical creationism into the science class by changing the name; but when you get down to the basics, the general view is that an invisible magic man did it! Shermer began his academic life as creationist accepting the rebuttals of evolution at face value; then he actually looked at the science of evolution. As a convert to evolution, Shermer’s account here is all the more damaging to the cause of the intelligent design lobby as he highlights the sheer beauty and simplicity of Darwin’s theory."

Here's a guy who used to be a stanch creationist, reading and following some of the ""back woodsy"" types of creationists only to find that he has seen the ""truth"" and the ""truth"" has set him free...that truth being Darwinism. There are a miriad of reasons to hate this book - I can't stand authors that quote themselves for no good reason than to quote themselves; being belittled because religious people are just children who can't handle real life; or the shear sarcasm, audacity and arrogance that drips from every page. Read his column instead of this book, it's only a page, so you can get done with it soon enough to digest before laying in bed with heartburn."

It might be useful for the ""Fence Sitters,"" as Shermer calls them, those who aren't clear as to what the debate is all about. Shermer isn’t against belief in God, just certain versions of him (or her, they, it) and asserts that Christians can accept evolution as one source of moral values. The most interesting part of the book to me is chapter 9, where Shermer discusses what he calls the”real unsolved problems in evolution,” such as where life began, what causes major shifts in evolution, and what is the target of natural selection. Title aside, this is still a short, readable summary and clarified for me just what it is that people object to in evolutionary theory. "

Because of the rigors of what it takes to move a hypothesis to being a theory and the willingness of scientists to uncover new truths about existing studies and new areas of exploration, science is always progressing. ID cannot be studied without science, and as such, should be a belief system for Christians to hold separately from 21st century intellectual education.Due to Shermer's quotes form Carl Sagan's ""Demon-Haunted World"", I will be reading THAT book soon because of the sense of awe and wonder it conveys about what we have learned about our world and the universe so far."

This book, written by the head of the National Skeptics Society, pretty much lays bare all the arguments used against evolution in the name of equal time or “teaching the controversy” of (essentially) creationism vs. evolution. Science has a process: Intelligent Design has an agenda. As Shermer concludes, “Darwin Matters because evolution matters. Evolution matters because science matters. Science matters because it is the pre-eminent story of our age, an epic saga about who we are, where we came from and where we are going.” (P. 161) ‘Nuff said. "

After doing some research I’ve found out that the theory of intelligent design isn’t as new as its adepts would like to think. In fact, the theologian William Paley first proposed in 1802 an argument for the existence of an intelligent designer. The conclusion is that Darwin’s theory is still one of the most revolutionary ideas not only in the history of biology, but also in the history of scientific thought."

Most of the book seems to be some history and background which is interesting, but not particularly focused. Personally, this book is weaker in its arguments than something like Faith vs Fact and Why Evolution is True by Jerry Coyne. It's a simple book but would not be my recommendation for a book that deals with evolution. The best thing he does in this book is demonstrate that Intelligent Design is a weakly disguised Creationism and that's it."
38,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2318453-paul,2,"The AuthorMichael Shermer is a former fundamentalist Christian turned skeptic. In fact, he started The Skeptics Society and is the editor in chief of Skeptic magazine. Shermer got his B.A. in Psychology from Pepperdine (though he began as a theology major). He went on to get his Master's in Experimental Psychology from CSU-Fullerton, and his Ph.D in the History of Science from Claremont. Shermer is the classic case of a Christian who turned his back on the faith when confronted with facts and then took up a career as an apologist against the faith (see also Bart Ehrman).SummaryThis book lays out the history of the development of the theory of evolution, and also a brief history of Shermer's journey from fundamentalist Christian faith to accepting the theory of evolution as true. Shermer attempts to give reasons why people disagree with evolution (and believe in religion). I imagine much of this material found its source in his other book Why People Believe Weird Things. Shermer researches the reasons behind the Intelligent Design movement and interviews its greatest supporters and determines that Intelligent Design is really just Creationism revisited. From this he determines that the argument to get ID into schools is an attempt to push the Christian religious views down the throats of children. He carefully notes that all of the major proponents of Intelligent Design are evangelical Christians except one. He also notes that no other piece of science has ever resorted to using political power to force its inclusion into the curriculum. He then goes through the 10 best arguments for Intelligent Design and attempts to disprove them. He shows that Intelligent Design is all about proving evolution wrong and offers no contributions of its own.Shermer draws on his theological background to show why Christians should believe in evolution. He also argues for a Non Overlapping Magisteria view of the relationship between religion and science (a la Steven Jay Gould). In other words, science can't contradict religion and vice versa because science is about the natural world and religion is about the supernatural world.Shermer ends by introducing the 10 greatest problems with the theory of evolution and shows where change is expected and more research is needed.My TakeAs one would expect from a man with a Ph.D. in the History of Science, Shermer does a good job of presenting the gradual accumulation of evidence for evolution over time. He gives us brief insights into the history of the debate between evolution and Christianity, and gives us some quotes from Darwin himself to show how he wrestled with his own ideas and their implications. Shermer also does a nice job of showing how Intelligent Design is *not* science, and is not helpful to scientists. Science is based on methodological naturalism, the assumption that everything has a natural cause. This limitation in scope is what makes science so good at what it does. A scientist can never throw his hands up and say ""It must be God"". There is no room for miracles. So scientists will search for the solution to a problem for generations! Scientists will proceed by trial and error forever to figure something out. That is why science has done such a good job of explaining how our universe works.Intelligent Design wants us to base our science on methodological supernaturalism, the assumption that some things have supernatural causes. But any scientist can see that this robs the scientific method of its greatest strength: its persistence. Now, any scientist working on any problem can just raise his hands and cry ""I can't explain it. It must be a miracle!""The right thing to do is not to include miracles into science, it is to show people the inherent limitations of science. I agree with Shermer on this point. Intelligent Design is not science.So, the first three quarters of this book, in my opinion, correctly show the evidence for evolution, the problems with ID, the history of the debate, and the underlying rationale of the ID crowd. All of this is worth reading. (Caveat: The justification of religion on evolutionary terms is weak almost to the point of ridiculousness)After that the book goes downhill fast, both in terms of quality of thought and quantity of evidence. (Exception: Chapter 10 on the problems in evolution is both honest and well done.) Shermer's attempt to show how religion and science are compatible is terrible. Shermer ""shows"" how religion evolved to make our evolved morals work better. This ""showing"" involves mostly suggestions of how it could have happened. Then he sallies forth with some philosophy showing how science and religion should relate to one another (the NOMA principle ... which isn't that bad, it's just poorly argued for). Shermer fails to impress there too. Finally, he adds an appendix to show how science can fill the void left by religion because religion is all about awe and science can inspire awe. So science is the new religion. Which is kind of what one would expect from a guy who has lived as a Christian, and felt like his faith betrayed him, and is looking for something else. The appendix should be required reading for anyone who does not believe that we should start educating our children on how science fits into the big picture of life. "
39,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61808093-alexander-rivas,4,"Being a Christian, I wanted to start to understand this whole evolution versus creation debate. I decided to read this book where I learned about Darwin, the setbacks both sides face in our society, and how a Christian can believe in evolution without going against his beliefs. I enjoyed this book and never felt upset or angered by its content."
40,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43784978-tracie-nicolai,3,Interesting. There are a couple of troublesome premises offered. Well done on the Darwin insights and educational impacts. 
41,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11566185-alan,2,"Needless to say, I disagree with the stanch naturalistic presuppositional tone in which this book was written. However, I picked this book knowing what to expect. Given that Michael Shermer is a militant agnostic, I don't expect him to write much differently. Honestly, I like Mike Shermer because he genuinely seems like a down-to-earth guy. Unfortunately, like the other mainstream atheist authors, he paints any worldview that doesn't coincide with mainstream Darwinism as an anchor that will inevitably slow the progress of science. This is discouraging to read because it is a complete misrepresentation of reality. Shermer ideologically assumes that intelligent design (ID) is a religious attack on science. This message is continuously communicated throughout the book. In his view, ID is a conspiracy against the ""scientific community"" (notice the presupposition that ID has nothing to add to the scientific dialogue) to demote science from a objective methodology of gathering information, testing hypothesis, etc... to throwing Bibles at children in schools. With this message being present throughout the book, it almost appears that regardless of what advocates of ID bring to the table, they will be dismissed before their ideas are even considered. It seems to be a philosophical commitment to rejecting anything with the possibility of a designer rather than being open to conclusions based on evidence, despite implications of a designer. Shermer attempts to take on some common ID arguments for the possibility of a designer. For example, the fine-tuning argument, as he admits, is the strongest argument for the existence of a designer. However, his treatment of it is horribly insufficient, especially when he is attempting to make 'the case against ID'. He treats to argument with sentiments like, 'the vast universe is empty space', 'the majority of the universe is inhospitable to life', and 'it is only in recent to time that the universe became finely tuned for life', just to name the highlights. He then resorted to saying that since the multiverse is a probable theory, of a potentially infinite amount of universes that exist, it's not surprising to see life existing under these types of improbable conditions. Clearly, it is irrelevant how occupied our universe is with life in order for it to be fine-tuned. Fine-tuning isn't contingent on the presence of life, life is contingent on the existence of fine-tuning. Without the presence of fine-tuning, the universe wouldn't be habitable. Since he has provided an insufficient refutation of fine-tuning, predictably, he enacted the multiverse theory to counteract the incomprehensibly improbable existence of fine-tuning of the universe for life. Despite what people like Shermer say about the speculative existence of a multiverse, there is no evidence for it and it plays a god-like figure in the ideologies of skeptics. Shermer attempted to treat the moral component of evolution near the end of the book. He declares that since objective morals exist, they are the result of biological evolution for the purposes of survivability. Under a Darwinian worldview, if true, they would have developed under the process of evolution and social conditioning. However, morals would not be objective. Meaning, there would not be a transcendent source for morality in which to judge moral actions. Essentially, no reference point in which to gauge moral good vs. bad. Shermer fails to address the ontological basis for morals under a Darwinian worldview. Maybe he completely overlooked it on the basis of this fact. A worldview is never appealing when you tell your adherents that there is no objective moral difference between Mother Theresa and Hitler.Overall, it was a good summary of the Darwinian point of view. Shermer is a good and qualified representative of this worldview. In my own opinion, it appeared that the ID position and overall ID motive on most matters was misrepresented to make the Darwinian position look better. Like I said, it's a mainstream book and you have to decipher the fact vs. the fiction."
42,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/369290-the-other-john,2,"The conflict between evolution and intelligent design is one of the warmer issues of the day. Since reading 
Darwin on Trial
, I've been in the design camp, but I've never been completely comfortable there. There's been too many times when a person whose opinions I respect blasts into intelligent design and I fumble about looking for an excuse for my position. And when some ardent supporter of my side starts laying on the propaganda, I likewise wince. So while I was back overseas, one thing I decided I should do upon my return to the land of the free and home of the public library was do some more digging on evolution. Specifically, I wanted to get some more info on how a supporter of evolution would respond to the main arguments of the design side. Well, this book was my first attempt at getting more info. Mr. Shermer was helpful in clearing away some of the confusion in my mind, but didn't draw me any closer to the evolution camp. The biggest favor that Mr. Shermer did was point out that the leading proponents of intelligent design are really creationists trying to sell their beliefs in a new package. I don't care for sales pitches regardless of who's doing the selling. That's the main reason why I would rate the book as waiting room material, despite the useful information it contains. Mr. Shermer has his own agenda to promote. As for the meat of the debate, I get the impression that, like the abortion conflict, the problem lies in the conflict of two different issues. By definition, science excludes the supernatural. If you can't observe it, measure it, study it, then you can't assume it exists. To bring divine revelation, namely, the Bible, into the science classroom, is a violation of the scientific method. I think what happened over the years in Western society is that many people have started to consider the scientific method the only source of authoritative knowledge. So while any good scientist will tell you that any scientific law or theory might be proven wrong some day, they will proceed to live as if the accepted laws and theories are the truth. Just as I live as if the Bible is the truth. So where does this leave me? Well, I wouldn't mind digging up some more info on evolution. I'm curious about the fossil record and just how many of the bones in the skeletons are real and how many have been imagined to fill in the gaps. But I also realize that I'm never going to have a simple, irrefutable argument as to why we should believe we're created. In the end, only the Creator can prove He exists."
43,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18061078-emma,1,"This book isn't about ""Why Darwin Matters"", it's an overview of what Intelligent Design is, how it's been used as a Trojan horse to try and sneak creationism into science, what its arguments are and why they're easy to debunk, etc. Shermer includes a lot of little factoids that are simplified to the point of being wrong, such as defining sexual selection as nothing more than female choice (although he does at least mention that other aspects of sexual selection exist in a later chapter) and saying things like ""ever since Darwin, [people have had an idea that was around long before Darwin]"". In a chapter focused mainly around why Christians shouldn't turn to intelligent design (because most of the ""Intelligent Design"" groups are run by evangelical Christians), he goes off on a random tangent about monogamy in which he projects his personal opinions onto nature with no evidence from biological research and demonizes men in the process (I know people throw around empty accusations of ""demonizing men"" whenever someone brings up sexism or toxic masculinity, but Shermer actually does it, along with infantilizing women and misinterpreting a study of college students in order to perpetuate the ""coy females"" stereotype that's been sneaking into biology for a while). Then, in the same chapter, he throws in a section about conservatives for some unknown reason (?) and starts rambling about Adam Smith and seems to argue for Social Darwinism, and makes up some nonsense about how evolution supposedly promotes some Malthusian, social Darwinist, extremely anti-Christian views (in the same chapter where he's trying to recruit Christians). There's no possible way this argument was written in good faith, because he's obviously done enough research to know that Darwinism isn't the same as Social Darwinism -- and even if it were, it's not something you should be promoting. Trying to get people to accept evolution by telling them that it will let them make up a pseudo-scientific argument in favor of whatever they already want to do, whether it's monogamy or laissez-faire economics or eugenics or anything else, is not an argument for evolution. Some parts of this book are pretty good as a basic overview of the topic (which is ""what's the Intelligent Design debate all about?"", not ""why does Darwin matter?""), but there are far better sources out there for this information, and I can't think of a reason to read this book when you could read almost anything else on the topic."
44,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3648143-rob,4,"When Michael Shermer surveyed people about their religious beliefs, asking them why they believed in God and why they thought other people believe in God, he found that people tend to invoke intellectual causes for their personal beliefs and assign emotional causes for the beliefs of others. While this trend may not be true for all people, a majority of people sampled exhibit this textbook attribution bias. I am certainly guilty of this, even to the point where I can’t help but question if my reading of this book is evidence of a further bias, the confirmation bias--a prejudice in which I form an opinion and seek out information that supports my already held beliefs thus reinforcing my supposed intellectualism on the topic. I can partly blame Mr. Shermer for my acute neuroticism. It was, after all, his book, The Believing Brain, that introduced me to most of the concepts that now affect my thinking. But, I don’t think this is a bad thing. Skepticism is a healthy attribute. Shermer’s book, Why Darwin Matters: The Case Against Intelligent Design does a much better job expounding on its subtitle than it’s primary title. It is not until the last page that Shermer reveals why Darwin matters (it’s because evolution matters, which matters because science matters, so there you go). The entire book is dedicated to dispelling the myths surrounding both sides of the creationism vs. evolution debate. Its longest chapter breaks down the ten best arguments for intelligent design (ID) and exposes them as unscientific religious propaganda. Shermer argues with tact, for the most part, avoiding the hyperbole one might expect in a book of this nature.The chapter covering ID in American public schools is particularly compelling for me because I have worked in a conservative school district where a dominant religion plays a huge role in what is taught in school. Shermer, a proud libertarian, would want a privatized school system where parents can choose to send their kids to whatever school they want, but he lays out his defense of evolution only science classrooms since most Americans are publicly schooled. He summarizes several court cases, and builds his defense primarily on the legal justification for evolution in the classroom. He explains that creationism can not be understood as science when we understand what science is."
45,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3038974-steve-van-slyke,4,"For those who have not read much about evolution or the debate between creationists and science this is a good place to start. On the other hand for those that have, it may seem a bit thin in some areas but even so he offers many new takes on the relation between the domains of science and religion. He also mentions and quotes several other authorities whose works go into evolution more deeply such as Dawkins, Margulis, Mayr, Gould, Fortey, Kenneth Miller, and others. He also comments on the writings of the main proponents of ID, such as Behe, Dembski, Meyer and Wells.At one point Shermer states that he was advised against debating proponents of Intelligent Design because it only served to give them credibility. As I read more of his analysis of the arguments on both sides I began to agree with his advisers. Nevertheless, Shermer makes the case that when the stakes become more than just winning a debate, when it comes down to whether science, or religion thinly disguised as science, will be taught in public schools, then someone has to step forward and shine the light of reason on the discussion.Shermer points out that is a relatively small minority of religious groups, primarily the 70% of evangelical Christians who do not accept evolution. The vast majority of mainstream Protestants and Catholics do accept evolution.He goes on to make the case that there are three possible approaches to the relationship between religion and science: 1) to make war on each other, 2) to combine, or 3) to co-exist in separate realms. The latter he says is the only rational option. “Believers can have both religion and science as long as...” they don't try to force the two together. “God is beyond the dominion of science, and science is outside the realm of God.”"
46,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1542839-mike,4,"This was quite a good defense of the neo-Darwinian synthesis. I think I tend to hold Michael Shermer in lower intellectual regard than, for example, Richard Dawkins, Daniel Dennett, or Stephen Gould. But this book is really an excellent, scholarly work. Like the best output by Carl Sagan, Shermer regards people's faith with seriousness and respect, at the same time using logic and evidence to build his own case. The book starts with a great, pocket description of what evolution is, and what natural selection is, followed by a list of the reasons that people use to reject it. He ranks these reasons by their intellectual rigor, then refutes them using science and the data that have been found since the 1800s. He deals with social Darwinism, the non-effect that Darwinism has on ethics and morals, it's non-attachment to nihilism. He then talks about debate tactics that intelligent design proponents use in debates against him, ranks them again, and points out the fallacy in each. He presents a case of why Christians should accept evolution, using the language of theology and even showing the influence of Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations on Darwin's work. The final chapter is a fascinating look at the actual modern controversies in evolution science, as opposed to those trumped up by ID supporters. Again, all in all, an excellent, concise use of philosophy, genetics, theology, biology, and history against the creeping ID movement. "
47,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6076331-ergun-coruh,4,"The publisher of Skeptic magazine was once an enthusiastic Evangelical Christian, but his ardent pursuit of a scientific education induced reconsideration. Now he staunchly advocates discriminating religion from science and in this book concisely defends evolutionary theory from the almost exclusively -Evangelical--Christian-backed concept of intelligent design (ID), aka creationism, aka creation science--the name changes whenever a suit over having public schools teach the idea as science gets shot down by a high U.S. court (the ID movement always appeals mere state-court decisions). Shermer debates ID often, and he expertly marshals point-by-point explanations of why evolution is worthwhile science, why ID isn't science at all, why ID criticisms of evolution are irrelevant, why science cannot invalidate religion, and why Christians and conservatives ought to accept evolution. His orderly presentation makes the book something of a reference manual on evolution, and only the historically minded will smile at his citation of congruence between evolution and Adam Smith as reason for conservatives to embrace evolution, for Smith's capitalism is a branch of classical liberalism.

But this was a good read as it breaks down the most common arguments against evolution and shows why biologists and naturalists reject and laugh at them. It's a good guide on how to argue with a creationist but things have changed since then and creationists are creating new arguments to justify their beliefs so this is a tip of the iceberg since creationists have some more arguments that this book doesn't cover, might need to do a little bit of research there. Along with covering all of the arguments and what your response should be to each, it also explains the different forms of creationism and intelligent design. Shermer might want to re-release it to provide updated information in the section explaining what we really don't know about evolution since a Google search into what we still don't know about evolution turns up a bunch of creationist sites and no actual answers to the question. If you are questioning the reasoning and logic behind the whole creationism thing then read this and decide which answer make sense between the science and the ideas from people that have no degrees in biology from a secular institution."

I'm giving it 4 stars because it's very informative and for the most part it's also enjoyable to read. Being a microbiologist and having previously read about ID I recognized many things in the text. However, I also understand that most people probably don't know so much about evolution or ID, and since ID is all about PR and propaganda it's easy to see that normal people don't immediately see it for what it is: a copy-paste of creationism with the word ""Designer"" replacing ""God"".This book is mainly aimed towards the American public, since it's in the US most of the Intelligent Design Movement exists. A big reason for this (also explained in the book) is the verdict of the Edwards v. Aguillard trial in 1987, where the US Supreme Court ruled that ""Teaching creationism in public schools is unconstitutional.."". This lead to the birth of the ""Intelligent Design Creationism"" and eventually a second court case, Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District in 2005, again with the court ruling that Intelligent Design is not science but merely Creationism pretending to be Science."

It provides good talking points to arm yourself with if you plan to enter a debate with a creationist. It is interesting that the intelligent design movement is just a warmed over version of creationism that is trying to pose as scientific. Their main strategy so far has been to refute evolution. They do not have any research or evidence to back up any of their claims. The whole creationist mind set is based on ancient texts that can not be edited or updated when new evidence comes to light. Since they see the bible as the unerring word of God, they cannot incorporate the evidence of evolution because it renders their texts inaccurate. The creation myths of Genesis are understandable as a means for a Bronze Age civilization to explain their world. But given the tools and methods of science that we have now, there is no excuse to believe that the accounts of the worlds creation in the Bible are true. Get this book and read it. Then discuss with your creationist friends! "

However, I do recommend this book to people who are new to the debate, or to people who have just not thought about it that much.I'm a skeptic, and have read Mr. Shermer's various articles in Skeptic Magazine and through various skeptic websites, such as Skeptologists. Though I already knew most of the information presented, I found that Mr. Shermer was far less condescending than other skeptics I've read (I'm looking at you, Christopher Hitchens), and presented the material in an accessable, easy-to-understand matter. He carefully breaks down the sides of the argument and goes to show why evolution does, in fact, matter. What stuck with me the most, I think, was a question he posits somewhere towards the end of the book: why would anyone want to limit their deity to the physical realm in which we inhabit?"
52,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1264081-melydia,3,"I came away from this book with rather tepid feelings. It didn't feel like it flowed very well from point to point, and each point made felt glossed over, with a couple of bare sentences with a footnote. Shermer's survey of evolutionary biology was often unclear, but when he was in his element - that is, the psychology of belief and religiosity - the tone became smooth and easy to read. I especially liked his discussion of the evolution of morality and the Genesis revisit at the end. However, I found his discussion of logical fallacies fell flat, his responses to Intelligent Design arguments felt unsatisfying even to an evolutionist like myself, and he spent so much time referring to other books that I started to wonder what purpose there was in reading this one. I am not sure what the target audience of this book was, but I don't think I was part of it. Still, I do want to pick up some of Shermer's other works that fall closer to his own field of study. "
53,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51466379-morninglight-mama,3,"While I can't say with any shred of honesty that I understood the vast majority of this book, I can appreciate Shermer's emphasis on the so-called evolution vs. creationism or evolution vs. Intelligent Design debates. The simple bottom line is that evolution is science and both creationism and ID have no scientific basis, but are instead theological ideas and therefore do not belong in the same conversation of science. I know some people were turned off by his bouts of smugness or sarcasm throughout this book, but I could understand the frustration that could lead someone to communicate seemingly obvious arguments with a tinge of 'C'MON already!' I tried my best to get through the complex scientific jargon, but I mostly enjoyed the sections that discuss the more sociological perspectives of these 'conflicts' of ideas."
54,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/747149-jacob,2,"Honestly, I didn't finish this book. It offered no insight or argument that I already didn't know and understand. I'm also not sure how many people would find this book interesting. It's arguments against Intelligent Design from a former creationist. Creationists won't care what the arguments are and will avoid this on principle. Those with scientific interest and any basic knowledge should already understand this stuff. I guess there may be a market of undecided, open minded readers who aren't scientifically knowledgable, but are interested. In that circumstance, this would be a very good read. It's a slim book with clear, well-stated arguments, but I seriously doubt there are many people who would care or be interested who don't already know this stuff."
55,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/937966-mark,3,"Shermer has in the past presented ideas in an entertaining and inquisitive way. However, I think that that while this book certainly puts forward a clear argument why ID (Intelligent Design) fails, it does so with the caveat: there might still be something...Shermer is not an atheist, but an agnostic, and this book does not go the full route against Intelligent Design. That being said, the book is easy to read, and in the same style as Shermer's other excellent books such as Why People Believe Weird Things (a better book in my opinion). Intelligent Design fails absolutely as a scientific theory and Shermer makes that clear. However, the ""theory"" is still writhing in the dirt and Shermer walks away from the kill."
56,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61943-tamara,4,"Again, Shermer gets technical, but is still interesting. Not that I had to be convinced; evolution happened. One thing I like about Shermer is that he doesn't ridicule those who have religious faith, he just points out that the more literal sects (for instance, those who believe the Earth is only 10,000 years old) are just being stubbornly ignorant in ignoring irrefutable evidence that Earth is MUCH older than that. And he includes examples of scientists who have both strong religous faith and a belief in what science shows them to be true."
57,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/242253-sean-duffy,4,"There's nothing new here, but the text is clear and persuasive even though Shermer was preaching to the choir. I'm convinced that evolution happened and is happening (except for humans, for whom natural selection has been eliminated). ID's best arguments are explained and effectively dealt with. Still there persists the nagging question: why? As in, yes but, why? That question will remain unanswerable, and therein lies the only real argument for God. But this stuff about the Singularity is frightening. We should already be smashing the machines with our shoes."

To be honest, I already knew all of the scientific issues from reading debates online, so I didn't learn much from it, but I do think the book probably does a good job at convincing people who are already at least leaning towards pro-evolution but don't know all the details yet. For those that are leaning the other way, there's not enough there. I also had to raise an eyebrow at some of Shermer's reasons as to why conservatives and Christians should be pro-evolution.

Most of the book seems to be some history and background which is interesting, but not particularly focused. Personally, this book is weaker in its arguments than something like Faith vs Fact and Why Evolution is True by Jerry Coyne. It's a simple book but would not be my recommendation for a book that deals with evolution. The best thing he does in this book is demonstrate that Intelligent Design is a weakly disguised Creationism and that's it."
68,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2318453-paul,2,"The AuthorMichael Shermer is a former fundamentalist Christian turned skeptic. In fact, he started The Skeptics Society and is the editor in chief of Skeptic magazine. Shermer got his B.A. in Psychology from Pepperdine (though he began as a theology major). He went on to get his Master's in Experimental Psychology from CSU-Fullerton, and his Ph.D in the History of Science from Claremont. Shermer is the classic case of a Christian who turned his back on the faith when confronted with facts and then took up a career as an apologist against the faith (see also Bart Ehrman).SummaryThis book lays out the history of the development of the theory of evolution, and also a brief history of Shermer's journey from fundamentalist Christian faith to accepting the theory of evolution as true. Shermer attempts to give reasons why people disagree with evolution (and believe in religion). I imagine much of this material found its source in his other book Why People Believe Weird Things. Shermer researches the reasons behind the Intelligent Design movement and interviews its greatest supporters and determines that Intelligent Design is really just Creationism revisited. From this he determines that the argument to get ID into schools is an attempt to push the Christian religious views down the throats of children. He carefully notes that all of the major proponents of Intelligent Design are evangelical Christians except one. He also notes that no other piece of science has ever resorted to using political power to force its inclusion into the curriculum. He then goes through the 10 best arguments for Intelligent Design and attempts to disprove them. He shows that Intelligent Design is all about proving evolution wrong and offers no contributions of its own.Shermer draws on his theological background to show why Christians should believe in evolution. He also argues for a Non Overlapping Magisteria view of the relationship between religion and science (a la Steven Jay Gould). In other words, science can't contradict religion and vice versa because science is about the natural world and religion is about the supernatural world.Shermer ends by introducing the 10 greatest problems with the theory of evolution and shows where change is expected and more research is needed.My TakeAs one would expect from a man with a Ph.D. in the History of Science, Shermer does a good job of presenting the gradual accumulation of evidence for evolution over time. He gives us brief insights into the history of the debate between evolution and Christianity, and gives us some quotes from Darwin himself to show how he wrestled with his own ideas and their implications. Shermer also does a nice job of showing how Intelligent Design is *not* science, and is not helpful to scientists. Science is based on methodological naturalism, the assumption that everything has a natural cause. This limitation in scope is what makes science so good at what it does. A scientist can never throw his hands up and say ""It must be God"". There is no room for miracles. So scientists will search for the solution to a problem for generations! Scientists will proceed by trial and error forever to figure something out. That is why science has done such a good job of explaining how our universe works.Intelligent Design wants us to base our science on methodological supernaturalism, the assumption that some things have supernatural causes. But any scientist can see that this robs the scientific method of its greatest strength: its persistence. Now, any scientist working on any problem can just raise his hands and cry ""I can't explain it. It must be a miracle!""The right thing to do is not to include miracles into science, it is to show people the inherent limitations of science. I agree with Shermer on this point. Intelligent Design is not science.So, the first three quarters of this book, in my opinion, correctly show the evidence for evolution, the problems with ID, the history of the debate, and the underlying rationale of the ID crowd. All of this is worth reading. (Caveat: The justification of religion on evolutionary terms is weak almost to the point of ridiculousness)After that the book goes downhill fast, both in terms of quality of thought and quantity of evidence. (Exception: Chapter 10 on the problems in evolution is both honest and well done.) Shermer's attempt to show how religion and science are compatible is terrible. Shermer ""shows"" how religion evolved to make our evolved morals work better. This ""showing"" involves mostly suggestions of how it could have happened. Then he sallies forth with some philosophy showing how science and religion should relate to one another (the NOMA principle ... which isn't that bad, it's just poorly argued for). Shermer fails to impress there too. Finally, he adds an appendix to show how science can fill the void left by religion because religion is all about awe and science can inspire awe. So science is the new religion. Which is kind of what one would expect from a guy who has lived as a Christian, and felt like his faith betrayed him, and is looking for something else. The appendix should be required reading for anyone who does not believe that we should start educating our children on how science fits into the big picture of life. "
69,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61808093-alexander-rivas,4,"Being a Christian, I wanted to start to understand this whole evolution versus creation debate. I decided to read this book where I learned about Darwin, the setbacks both sides face in our society, and how a Christian can believe in evolution without going against his beliefs. I enjoyed this book and never felt upset or angered by its content."
70,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43784978-tracie-nicolai,3,Interesting. There are a couple of troublesome premises offered. Well done on the Darwin insights and educational impacts. 
71,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11566185-alan,2,"Needless to say, I disagree with the stanch naturalistic presuppositional tone in which this book was written. However, I picked this book knowing what to expect. Given that Michael Shermer is a militant agnostic, I don't expect him to write much differently. Honestly, I like Mike Shermer because he genuinely seems like a down-to-earth guy. Unfortunately, like the other mainstream atheist authors, he paints any worldview that doesn't coincide with mainstream Darwinism as an anchor that will inevitably slow the progress of science. This is discouraging to read because it is a complete misrepresentation of reality. Shermer ideologically assumes that intelligent design (ID) is a religious attack on science. This message is continuously communicated throughout the book. In his view, ID is a conspiracy against the ""scientific community"" (notice the presupposition that ID has nothing to add to the scientific dialogue) to demote science from a objective methodology of gathering information, testing hypothesis, etc... to throwing Bibles at children in schools. With this message being present throughout the book, it almost appears that regardless of what advocates of ID bring to the table, they will be dismissed before their ideas are even considered. It seems to be a philosophical commitment to rejecting anything with the possibility of a designer rather than being open to conclusions based on evidence, despite implications of a designer. Shermer attempts to take on some common ID arguments for the possibility of a designer. For example, the fine-tuning argument, as he admits, is the strongest argument for the existence of a designer. However, his treatment of it is horribly insufficient, especially when he is attempting to make 'the case against ID'. He treats to argument with sentiments like, 'the vast universe is empty space', 'the majority of the universe is inhospitable to life', and 'it is only in recent to time that the universe became finely tuned for life', just to name the highlights. He then resorted to saying that since the multiverse is a probable theory, of a potentially infinite amount of universes that exist, it's not surprising to see life existing under these types of improbable conditions. Clearly, it is irrelevant how occupied our universe is with life in order for it to be fine-tuned. Fine-tuning isn't contingent on the presence of life, life is contingent on the existence of fine-tuning. Without the presence of fine-tuning, the universe wouldn't be habitable. Since he has provided an insufficient refutation of fine-tuning, predictably, he enacted the multiverse theory to counteract the incomprehensibly improbable existence of fine-tuning of the universe for life. Despite what people like Shermer say about the speculative existence of a multiverse, there is no evidence for it and it plays a god-like figure in the ideologies of skeptics. Shermer attempted to treat the moral component of evolution near the end of the book. He declares that since objective morals exist, they are the result of biological evolution for the purposes of survivability. Under a Darwinian worldview, if true, they would have developed under the process of evolution and social conditioning. However, morals would not be objective. Meaning, there would not be a transcendent source for morality in which to judge moral actions. Essentially, no reference point in which to gauge moral good vs. bad. Shermer fails to address the ontological basis for morals under a Darwinian worldview. Maybe he completely overlooked it on the basis of this fact. A worldview is never appealing when you tell your adherents that there is no objective moral difference between Mother Theresa and Hitler.Overall, it was a good summary of the Darwinian point of view. Shermer is a good and qualified representative of this worldview. In my own opinion, it appeared that the ID position and overall ID motive on most matters was misrepresented to make the Darwinian position look better. Like I said, it's a mainstream book and you have to decipher the fact vs. the fiction."
72,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/369290-the-other-john,2,"The conflict between evolution and intelligent design is one of the warmer issues of the day. Since reading 
Darwin on Trial
, I've been in the design camp, but I've never been completely comfortable there. There's been too many times when a person whose opinions I respect blasts into intelligent design and I fumble about looking for an excuse for my position. And when some ardent supporter of my side starts laying on the propaganda, I likewise wince. So while I was back overseas, one thing I decided I should do upon my return to the land of the free and home of the public library was do some more digging on evolution. Specifically, I wanted to get some more info on how a supporter of evolution would respond to the main arguments of the design side. Well, this book was my first attempt at getting more info. Mr. Shermer was helpful in clearing away some of the confusion in my mind, but didn't draw me any closer to the evolution camp. The biggest favor that Mr. Shermer did was point out that the leading proponents of intelligent design are really creationists trying to sell their beliefs in a new package. I don't care for sales pitches regardless of who's doing the selling. That's the main reason why I would rate the book as waiting room material, despite the useful information it contains. Mr. Shermer has his own agenda to promote. As for the meat of the debate, I get the impression that, like the abortion conflict, the problem lies in the conflict of two different issues. By definition, science excludes the supernatural. If you can't observe it, measure it, study it, then you can't assume it exists. To bring divine revelation, namely, the Bible, into the science classroom, is a violation of the scientific method. I think what happened over the years in Western society is that many people have started to consider the scientific method the only source of authoritative knowledge. So while any good scientist will tell you that any scientific law or theory might be proven wrong some day, they will proceed to live as if the accepted laws and theories are the truth. Just as I live as if the Bible is the truth. So where does this leave me? Well, I wouldn't mind digging up some more info on evolution. I'm curious about the fossil record and just how many of the bones in the skeletons are real and how many have been imagined to fill in the gaps. But I also realize that I'm never going to have a simple, irrefutable argument as to why we should believe we're created. In the end, only the Creator can prove He exists."
73,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18061078-emma,1,"This book isn't about ""Why Darwin Matters"", it's an overview of what Intelligent Design is, how it's been used as a Trojan horse to try and sneak creationism into science, what its arguments are and why they're easy to debunk, etc. Shermer includes a lot of little factoids that are simplified to the point of being wrong, such as defining sexual selection as nothing more than female choice (although he does at least mention that other aspects of sexual selection exist in a later chapter) and saying things like ""ever since Darwin, [people have had an idea that was around long before Darwin]"". In a chapter focused mainly around why Christians shouldn't turn to intelligent design (because most of the ""Intelligent Design"" groups are run by evangelical Christians), he goes off on a random tangent about monogamy in which he projects his personal opinions onto nature with no evidence from biological research and demonizes men in the process (I know people throw around empty accusations of ""demonizing men"" whenever someone brings up sexism or toxic masculinity, but Shermer actually does it, along with infantilizing women and misinterpreting a study of college students in order to perpetuate the ""coy females"" stereotype that's been sneaking into biology for a while). Then, in the same chapter, he throws in a section about conservatives for some unknown reason (?) and starts rambling about Adam Smith and seems to argue for Social Darwinism, and makes up some nonsense about how evolution supposedly promotes some Malthusian, social Darwinist, extremely anti-Christian views (in the same chapter where he's trying to recruit Christians). There's no possible way this argument was written in good faith, because he's obviously done enough research to know that Darwinism isn't the same as Social Darwinism -- and even if it were, it's not something you should be promoting. Trying to get people to accept evolution by telling them that it will let them make up a pseudo-scientific argument in favor of whatever they already want to do, whether it's monogamy or laissez-faire economics or eugenics or anything else, is not an argument for evolution. Some parts of this book are pretty good as a basic overview of the topic (which is ""what's the Intelligent Design debate all about?"", not ""why does Darwin matter?""), but there are far better sources out there for this information, and I can't think of a reason to read this book when you could read almost anything else on the topic."
74,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3648143-rob,4,"When Michael Shermer surveyed people about their religious beliefs, asking them why they believed in God and why they thought other people believe in God, he found that people tend to invoke intellectual causes for their personal beliefs and assign emotional causes for the beliefs of others. While this trend may not be true for all people, a majority of people sampled exhibit this textbook attribution bias. I am certainly guilty of this, even to the point where I can’t help but question if my reading of this book is evidence of a further bias, the confirmation bias--a prejudice in which I form an opinion and seek out information that supports my already held beliefs thus reinforcing my supposed intellectualism on the topic. I can partly blame Mr. Shermer for my acute neuroticism. It was, after all, his book, The Believing Brain, that introduced me to most of the concepts that now affect my thinking. But, I don’t think this is a bad thing. Skepticism is a healthy attribute. Shermer’s book, Why Darwin Matters: The Case Against Intelligent Design does a much better job expounding on its subtitle than it’s primary title. It is not until the last page that Shermer reveals why Darwin matters (it’s because evolution matters, which matters because science matters, so there you go). The entire book is dedicated to dispelling the myths surrounding both sides of the creationism vs. evolution debate. Its longest chapter breaks down the ten best arguments for intelligent design (ID) and exposes them as unscientific religious propaganda. Shermer argues with tact, for the most part, avoiding the hyperbole one might expect in a book of this nature.The chapter covering ID in American public schools is particularly compelling for me because I have worked in a conservative school district where a dominant religion plays a huge role in what is taught in school. Shermer, a proud libertarian, would want a privatized school system where parents can choose to send their kids to whatever school they want, but he lays out his defense of evolution only science classrooms since most Americans are publicly schooled. He summarizes several court cases, and builds his defense primarily on the legal justification for evolution in the classroom. He explains that creationism can not be understood as science when we understand what science is."
75,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3038974-steve-van-slyke,4,"For those who have not read much about evolution or the debate between creationists and science this is a good place to start. On the other hand for those that have, it may seem a bit thin in some areas but even so he offers many new takes on the relation between the domains of science and religion. He also mentions and quotes several other authorities whose works go into evolution more deeply such as Dawkins, Margulis, Mayr, Gould, Fortey, Kenneth Miller, and others. He also comments on the writings of the main proponents of ID, such as Behe, Dembski, Meyer and Wells.At one point Shermer states that he was advised against debating proponents of Intelligent Design because it only served to give them credibility. As I read more of his analysis of the arguments on both sides I began to agree with his advisers. Nevertheless, Shermer makes the case that when the stakes become more than just winning a debate, when it comes down to whether science, or religion thinly disguised as science, will be taught in public schools, then someone has to step forward and shine the light of reason on the discussion.Shermer points out that is a relatively small minority of religious groups, primarily the 70% of evangelical Christians who do not accept evolution. The vast majority of mainstream Protestants and Catholics do accept evolution.He goes on to make the case that there are three possible approaches to the relationship between religion and science: 1) to make war on each other, 2) to combine, or 3) to co-exist in separate realms. The latter he says is the only rational option. “Believers can have both religion and science as long as...” they don't try to force the two together. “God is beyond the dominion of science, and science is outside the realm of God.”"
76,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1542839-mike,4,"This was quite a good defense of the neo-Darwinian synthesis. I think I tend to hold Michael Shermer in lower intellectual regard than, for example, Richard Dawkins, Daniel Dennett, or Stephen Gould. But this book is really an excellent, scholarly work. Like the best output by Carl Sagan, Shermer regards people's faith with seriousness and respect, at the same time using logic and evidence to build his own case. The book starts with a great, pocket description of what evolution is, and what natural selection is, followed by a list of the reasons that people use to reject it. He ranks these reasons by their intellectual rigor, then refutes them using science and the data that have been found since the 1800s. He deals with social Darwinism, the non-effect that Darwinism has on ethics and morals, it's non-attachment to nihilism. He then talks about debate tactics that intelligent design proponents use in debates against him, ranks them again, and points out the fallacy in each. He presents a case of why Christians should accept evolution, using the language of theology and even showing the influence of Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations on Darwin's work. The final chapter is a fascinating look at the actual modern controversies in evolution science, as opposed to those trumped up by ID supporters. Again, all in all, an excellent, concise use of philosophy, genetics, theology, biology, and history against the creeping ID movement. "
77,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6076331-ergun-coruh,4,"The publisher of Skeptic magazine was once an enthusiastic Evangelical Christian, but his ardent pursuit of a scientific education induced reconsideration. Now he staunchly advocates discriminating religion from science and in this book concisely defends evolutionary theory from the almost exclusively -Evangelical--Christian-backed concept of intelligent design (ID), aka creationism, aka creation science--the name changes whenever a suit over having public schools teach the idea as science gets shot down by a high U.S. court (the ID movement always appeals mere state-court decisions). Shermer debates ID often, and he expertly marshals point-by-point explanations of why evolution is worthwhile science, why ID isn't science at all, why ID criticisms of evolution are irrelevant, why science cannot invalidate religion, and why Christians and conservatives ought to accept evolution. His orderly presentation makes the book something of a reference manual on evolution, and only the historically minded will smile at his citation of congruence between evolution and Adam Smith as reason for conservatives to embrace evolution, for Smith's capitalism is a branch of classical liberalism.

But this was a good read as it breaks down the most common arguments against evolution and shows why biologists and naturalists reject and laugh at them. It's a good guide on how to argue with a creationist but things have changed since then and creationists are creating new arguments to justify their beliefs so this is a tip of the iceberg since creationists have some more arguments that this book doesn't cover, might need to do a little bit of research there. Along with covering all of the arguments and what your response should be to each, it also explains the different forms of creationism and intelligent design. Shermer might want to re-release it to provide updated information in the section explaining what we really don't know about evolution since a Google search into what we still don't know about evolution turns up a bunch of creationist sites and no actual answers to the question. If you are questioning the reasoning and logic behind the whole creationism thing then read this and decide which answer make sense between the science and the ideas from people that have no degrees in biology from a secular institution."

I'm giving it 4 stars because it's very informative and for the most part it's also enjoyable to read. Being a microbiologist and having previously read about ID I recognized many things in the text. However, I also understand that most people probably don't know so much about evolution or ID, and since ID is all about PR and propaganda it's easy to see that normal people don't immediately see it for what it is: a copy-paste of creationism with the word ""Designer"" replacing ""God"".This book is mainly aimed towards the American public, since it's in the US most of the Intelligent Design Movement exists. A big reason for this (also explained in the book) is the verdict of the Edwards v. Aguillard trial in 1987, where the US Supreme Court ruled that ""Teaching creationism in public schools is unconstitutional.."". This lead to the birth of the ""Intelligent Design Creationism"" and eventually a second court case, Kitzmiller v.

It provides good talking points to arm yourself with if you plan to enter a debate with a creationist. It is interesting that the intelligent design movement is just a warmed over version of creationism that is trying to pose as scientific. Their main strategy so far has been to refute evolution. They do not have any research or evidence to back up any of their claims. The whole creationist mind set is based on ancient texts that can not be edited or updated when new evidence comes to light. Since they see the bible as the unerring word of God, they cannot incorporate the evidence of evolution because it renders their texts inaccurate. The creation myths of Genesis are understandable as a means for a Bronze Age civilization to explain their world. But given the tools and methods of science that we have now, there is no excuse to believe that the accounts of the worlds creation in the Bible are true. Get this book and read it. Then discuss with your creationist friends! "
81,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/828715-sonya-s,4,"Let's be fair: this is not a book for those already embroiled in the debates of creationism v. evolution. If you already have an in-depth knowledge of the theory of evolution, or have had extensive science classes, this book is not going to present any new material. However, I do recommend this book to people who are new to the debate, or to people who have just not thought about it that much.I'm a skeptic, and have read Mr. Shermer's various articles in Skeptic Magazine and through various skeptic websites, such as Skeptologists. Though I already knew most of the information presented, I found that Mr. Shermer was far less condescending than other skeptics I've read (I'm looking at you, Christopher Hitchens), and presented the material in an accessable, easy-to-understand matter. He carefully breaks down the sides of the argument and goes to show why evolution does, in fact, matter. What stuck with me the most, I think, was a question he posits somewhere towards the end of the book: why would anyone want to limit their deity to the physical realm in which we inhabit?"
82,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1264081-melydia,3,"I came away from this book with rather tepid feelings. It didn't feel like it flowed very well from point to point, and each point made felt glossed over, with a couple of bare sentences with a footnote. Shermer's survey of evolutionary biology was often unclear, but when he was in his element - that is, the psychology of belief and religiosity - the tone became smooth and easy to read. I especially liked his discussion of the evolution of morality and the Genesis revisit at the end. However, I found his discussion of logical fallacies fell flat, his responses to Intelligent Design arguments felt unsatisfying even to an evolutionist like myself, and he spent so much time referring to other books that I started to wonder what purpose there was in reading this one. I am not sure what the target audience of this book was, but I don't think I was part of it. Still, I do want to pick up some of Shermer's other works that fall closer to his own field of study. "
83,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51466379-morninglight-mama,3,"While I can't say with any shred of honesty that I understood the vast majority of this book, I can appreciate Shermer's emphasis on the so-called evolution vs. creationism or evolution vs. Intelligent Design debates. The simple bottom line is that evolution is science and both creationism and ID have no scientific basis, but are instead theological ideas and therefore do not belong in the same conversation of science. I know some people were turned off by his bouts of smugness or sarcasm throughout this book, but I could understand the frustration that could lead someone to communicate seemingly obvious arguments with a tinge of 'C'MON already!' I tried my best to get through the complex scientific jargon, but I mostly enjoyed the sections that discuss the more sociological perspectives of these 'conflicts' of ideas."
84,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/747149-jacob,2,"Honestly, I didn't finish this book. It offered no insight or argument that I already didn't know and understand. I'm also not sure how many people would find this book interesting. It's arguments against Intelligent Design from a former creationist. Creationists won't care what the arguments are and will avoid this on principle. Those with scientific interest and any basic knowledge should already understand this stuff. I guess there may be a market of undecided, open minded readers who aren't scientifically knowledgable, but are interested. In that circumstance, this would be a very good read. It's a slim book with clear, well-stated arguments, but I seriously doubt there are many people who would care or be interested who don't already know this stuff."
85,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/937966-mark,3,"Shermer has in the past presented ideas in an entertaining and inquisitive way. However, I think that that while this book certainly puts forward a clear argument why ID (Intelligent Design) fails, it does so with the caveat: there might still be something...Shermer is not an atheist, but an agnostic, and this book does not go the full route against Intelligent Design. That being said, the book is easy to read, and in the same style as Shermer's other excellent books such as Why People Believe Weird Things (a better book in my opinion). Intelligent Design fails absolutely as a scientific theory and Shermer makes that clear. However, the ""theory"" is still writhing in the dirt and Shermer walks away from the kill."
86,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61943-tamara,4,"Again, Shermer gets technical, but is still interesting. Not that I had to be convinced; evolution happened. One thing I like about Shermer is that he doesn't ridicule those who have religious faith, he just points out that the more literal sects (for instance, those who believe the Earth is only 10,000 years old) are just being stubbornly ignorant in ignoring irrefutable evidence that Earth is MUCH older than that. And he includes examples of scientists who have both strong religous faith and a belief in what science shows them to be true."
87,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/242253-sean-duffy,4,"There's nothing new here, but the text is clear and persuasive even though Shermer was preaching to the choir. I'm convinced that evolution happened and is happening (except for humans, for whom natural selection has been eliminated). ID's best arguments are explained and effectively dealt with. Still there persists the nagging question: why? As in, yes but, why? That question will remain unanswerable, and therein lies the only real argument for God. But this stuff about the Singularity is frightening. We should already be smashing the machines with our shoes."
88,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1447864-joshua-nomen-mutatio,4,"An excellent book to hand to those who deny the veracity of the continually enlarging body of evidence that supports biological evolution or think ""intelligently designed"" evolution is a well-supported idea, and even to those who say they believe that evolution is real yet don't quite understand why (a category which I've found many people fall under).Shermer is well-positioned to write towards the beliefs of the religious who think that evolutionary theory is bogus since he was once one them: Shermer was a evangelical Christian for a few years before rejecting the whole thing."
89,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/872094-pingpongabyss,3,"Decent book by Michael Shermer about the intelligent design debate. To be honest, I already knew all of the scientific issues from reading debates online, so I didn't learn much from it, but I do think the book probably does a good job at convincing people who are already at least leaning towards pro-evolution but don't know all the details yet. For those that are leaning the other way, there's not enough there. I also had to raise an eyebrow at some of Shermer's reasons as to why conservatives and Christians should be pro-evolution. The invisible hand? Are you kidding me?"

Most of the book seems to be some history and background which is interesting, but not particularly focused. Personally, this book is weaker in its arguments than something like Faith vs Fact and Why Evolution is True by Jerry Coyne. It's a simple book but would not be my recommendation for a book that deals with evolution. The best thing he does in this book is demonstrate that Intelligent Design is a weakly disguised Creationism and that's it."
98,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2318453-paul,2,"The AuthorMichael Shermer is a former fundamentalist Christian turned skeptic. In fact, he started The Skeptics Society and is the editor in chief of Skeptic magazine. Shermer got his B.A. in Psychology from Pepperdine (though he began as a theology major). He went on to get his Master's in Experimental Psychology from CSU-Fullerton, and his Ph.D in the History of Science from Claremont. Shermer is the classic case of a Christian who turned his back on the faith when confronted with facts and then took up a career as an apologist against the faith (see also Bart Ehrman).SummaryThis book lays out the history of the development of the theory of evolution, and also a brief history of Shermer's journey from fundamentalist Christian faith to accepting the theory of evolution as true. Shermer attempts to give reasons why people disagree with evolution (and believe in religion). I imagine much of this material found its source in his other book Why People Believe Weird Things. Shermer researches the reasons behind the Intelligent Design movement and interviews its greatest supporters and determines that Intelligent Design is really just Creationism revisited. From this he determines that the argument to get ID into schools is an attempt to push the Christian religious views down the throats of children. He carefully notes that all of the major proponents of Intelligent Design are evangelical Christians except one. He also notes that no other piece of science has ever resorted to using political power to force its inclusion into the curriculum. He then goes through the 10 best arguments for Intelligent Design and attempts to disprove them. He shows that Intelligent Design is all about proving evolution wrong and offers no contributions of its own.Shermer draws on his theological background to show why Christians should believe in evolution. He also argues for a Non Overlapping Magisteria view of the relationship between religion and science (a la Steven Jay Gould). In other words, science can't contradict religion and vice versa because science is about the natural world and religion is about the supernatural world.Shermer ends by introducing the 10 greatest problems with the theory of evolution and shows where change is expected and more research is needed.My TakeAs one would expect from a man with a Ph.D. in the History of Science, Shermer does a good job of presenting the gradual accumulation of evidence for evolution over time. He gives us brief insights into the history of the debate between evolution and Christianity, and gives us some quotes from Darwin himself to show how he wrestled with his own ideas and their implications. Shermer also does a nice job of showing how Intelligent Design is *not* science, and is not helpful to scientists. Science is based on methodological naturalism, the assumption that everything has a natural cause. This limitation in scope is what makes science so good at what it does. A scientist can never throw his hands up and say ""It must be God"". There is no room for miracles. So scientists will search for the solution to a problem for generations! Scientists will proceed by trial and error forever to figure something out. That is why science has done such a good job of explaining how our universe works.Intelligent Design wants us to base our science on methodological supernaturalism, the assumption that some things have supernatural causes. But any scientist can see that this robs the scientific method of its greatest strength: its persistence. Now, any scientist working on any problem can just raise his hands and cry ""I can't explain it. It must be a miracle!""The right thing to do is not to include miracles into science, it is to show people the inherent limitations of science. I agree with Shermer on this point. Intelligent Design is not science.So, the first three quarters of this book, in my opinion, correctly show the evidence for evolution, the problems with ID, the history of the debate, and the underlying rationale of the ID crowd. All of this is worth reading. (Caveat: The justification of religion on evolutionary terms is weak almost to the point of ridiculousness)After that the book goes downhill fast, both in terms of quality of thought and quantity of evidence. (Exception: Chapter 10 on the problems in evolution is both honest and well done.) Shermer's attempt to show how religion and science are compatible is terrible. Shermer ""shows"" how religion evolved to make our evolved morals work better. This ""showing"" involves mostly suggestions of how it could have happened. Then he sallies forth with some philosophy showing how science and religion should relate to one another (the NOMA principle ... which isn't that bad, it's just poorly argued for). Shermer fails to impress there too. Finally, he adds an appendix to show how science can fill the void left by religion because religion is all about awe and science can inspire awe. So science is the new religion. Which is kind of what one would expect from a guy who has lived as a Christian, and felt like his faith betrayed him, and is looking for something else. The appendix should be required reading for anyone who does not believe that we should start educating our children on how science fits into the big picture of life. "
99,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61808093-alexander-rivas,4,"Being a Christian, I wanted to start to understand this whole evolution versus creation debate. I decided to read this book where I learned about Darwin, the setbacks both sides face in our society, and how a Christian can believe in evolution without going against his beliefs. I enjoyed this book and never felt upset or angered by its content."
100,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43784978-tracie-nicolai,3,Interesting. There are a couple of troublesome premises offered. Well done on the Darwin insights and educational impacts. 
101,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11566185-alan,2,"Needless to say, I disagree with the stanch naturalistic presuppositional tone in which this book was written. However, I picked this book knowing what to expect. Given that Michael Shermer is a militant agnostic, I don't expect him to write much differently. Honestly, I like Mike Shermer because he genuinely seems like a down-to-earth guy. Unfortunately, like the other mainstream atheist authors, he paints any worldview that doesn't coincide with mainstream Darwinism as an anchor that will inevitably slow the progress of science. This is discouraging to read because it is a complete misrepresentation of reality. Shermer ideologically assumes that intelligent design (ID) is a religious attack on science. This message is continuously communicated throughout the book. In his view, ID is a conspiracy against the ""scientific community"" (notice the presupposition that ID has nothing to add to the scientific dialogue) to demote science from a objective methodology of gathering information, testing hypothesis, etc... to throwing Bibles at children in schools. With this message being present throughout the book, it almost appears that regardless of what advocates of ID bring to the table, they will be dismissed before their ideas are even considered. It seems to be a philosophical commitment to rejecting anything with the possibility of a designer rather than being open to conclusions based on evidence, despite implications of a designer. Shermer attempts to take on some common ID arguments for the possibility of a designer. For example, the fine-tuning argument, as he admits, is the strongest argument for the existence of a designer. However, his treatment of it is horribly insufficient, especially when he is attempting to make 'the case against ID'. He treats to argument with sentiments like, 'the vast universe is empty space', 'the majority of the universe is inhospitable to life', and 'it is only in recent to time that the universe became finely tuned for life', just to name the highlights. He then resorted to saying that since the multiverse is a probable theory, of a potentially infinite amount of universes that exist, it's not surprising to see life existing under these types of improbable conditions. Clearly, it is irrelevant how occupied our universe is with life in order for it to be fine-tuned. Fine-tuning isn't contingent on the presence of life, life is contingent on the existence of fine-tuning. Without the presence of fine-tuning, the universe wouldn't be habitable. Since he has provided an insufficient refutation of fine-tuning, predictably, he enacted the multiverse theory to counteract the incomprehensibly improbable existence of fine-tuning of the universe for life. Despite what people like Shermer say about the speculative existence of a multiverse, there is no evidence for it and it plays a god-like figure in the ideologies of skeptics. Shermer attempted to treat the moral component of evolution near the end of the book. He declares that since objective morals exist, they are the result of biological evolution for the purposes of survivability. Under a Darwinian worldview, if true, they would have developed under the process of evolution and social conditioning. However, morals would not be objective. Meaning, there would not be a transcendent source for morality in which to judge moral actions. Essentially, no reference point in which to gauge moral good vs. bad. Shermer fails to address the ontological basis for morals under a Darwinian worldview. Maybe he completely overlooked it on the basis of this fact. A worldview is never appealing when you tell your adherents that there is no objective moral difference between Mother Theresa and Hitler.Overall, it was a good summary of the Darwinian point of view. Shermer is a good and qualified representative of this worldview. In my own opinion, it appeared that the ID position and overall ID motive on most matters was misrepresented to make the Darwinian position look better. Like I said, it's a mainstream book and you have to decipher the fact vs. the fiction."
102,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/369290-the-other-john,2,"The conflict between evolution and intelligent design is one of the warmer issues of the day. Since reading 
Darwin on Trial
, I've been in the design camp, but I've never been completely comfortable there. There's been too many times when a person whose opinions I respect blasts into intelligent design and I fumble about looking for an excuse for my position. And when some ardent supporter of my side starts laying on the propaganda, I likewise wince. So while I was back overseas, one thing I decided I should do upon my return to the land of the free and home of the public library was do some more digging on evolution. Specifically, I wanted to get some more info on how a supporter of evolution would respond to the main arguments of the design side. Well, this book was my first attempt at getting more info. Mr. Shermer was helpful in clearing away some of the confusion in my mind, but didn't draw me any closer to the evolution camp. The biggest favor that Mr. Shermer did was point out that the leading proponents of intelligent design are really creationists trying to sell their beliefs in a new package. I don't care for sales pitches regardless of who's doing the selling. That's the main reason why I would rate the book as waiting room material, despite the useful information it contains. Mr. Shermer has his own agenda to promote. As for the meat of the debate, I get the impression that, like the abortion conflict, the problem lies in the conflict of two different issues. By definition, science excludes the supernatural. If you can't observe it, measure it, study it, then you can't assume it exists. To bring divine revelation, namely, the Bible, into the science classroom, is a violation of the scientific method. I think what happened over the years in Western society is that many people have started to consider the scientific method the only source of authoritative knowledge. So while any good scientist will tell you that any scientific law or theory might be proven wrong some day, they will proceed to live as if the accepted laws and theories are the truth. Just as I live as if the Bible is the truth. So where does this leave me? Well, I wouldn't mind digging up some more info on evolution. I'm curious about the fossil record and just how many of the bones in the skeletons are real and how many have been imagined to fill in the gaps. But I also realize that I'm never going to have a simple, irrefutable argument as to why we should believe we're created. In the end, only the Creator can prove He exists."
103,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18061078-emma,1,"This book isn't about ""Why Darwin Matters"", it's an overview of what Intelligent Design is, how it's been used as a Trojan horse to try and sneak creationism into science, what its arguments are and why they're easy to debunk, etc. Shermer includes a lot of little factoids that are simplified to the point of being wrong, such as defining sexual selection as nothing more than female choice (although he does at least mention that other aspects of sexual selection exist in a later chapter) and saying things like ""ever since Darwin, [people have had an idea that was around long before Darwin]"". In a chapter focused mainly around why Christians shouldn't turn to intelligent design (because most of the ""Intelligent Design"" groups are run by evangelical Christians), he goes off on a random tangent about monogamy in which he projects his personal opinions onto nature with no evidence from biological research and demonizes men in the process (I know people throw around empty accusations of ""demonizing men"" whenever someone brings up sexism or toxic masculinity, but Shermer actually does it, along with infantilizing women and misinterpreting a study of college students in order to perpetuate the ""coy females"" stereotype that's been sneaking into biology for a while). Then, in the same chapter, he throws in a section about conservatives for some unknown reason (?) and starts rambling about Adam Smith and seems to argue for Social Darwinism, and makes up some nonsense about how evolution supposedly promotes some Malthusian, social Darwinist, extremely anti-Christian views (in the same chapter where he's trying to recruit Christians). There's no possible way this argument was written in good faith, because he's obviously done enough research to know that Darwinism isn't the same as Social Darwinism -- and even if it were, it's not something you should be promoting. Trying to get people to accept evolution by telling them that it will let them make up a pseudo-scientific argument in favor of whatever they already want to do, whether it's monogamy or laissez-faire economics or eugenics or anything else, is not an argument for evolution. Some parts of this book are pretty good as a basic overview of the topic (which is ""what's the Intelligent Design debate all about?"", not ""why does Darwin matter?""), but there are far better sources out there for this information, and I can't think of a reason to read this book when you could read almost anything else on the topic."
104,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3648143-rob,4,"When Michael Shermer surveyed people about their religious beliefs, asking them why they believed in God and why they thought other people believe in God, he found that people tend to invoke intellectual causes for their personal beliefs and assign emotional causes for the beliefs of others. While this trend may not be true for all people, a majority of people sampled exhibit this textbook attribution bias. I am certainly guilty of this, even to the point where I can’t help but question if my reading of this book is evidence of a further bias, the confirmation bias--a prejudice in which I form an opinion and seek out information that supports my already held beliefs thus reinforcing my supposed intellectualism on the topic. I can partly blame Mr. Shermer for my acute neuroticism. It was, after all, his book, The Believing Brain, that introduced me to most of the concepts that now affect my thinking. But, I don’t think this is a bad thing. Skepticism is a healthy attribute. Shermer’s book, Why Darwin Matters: The Case Against Intelligent Design does a much better job expounding on its subtitle than it’s primary title. It is not until the last page that Shermer reveals why Darwin matters (it’s because evolution matters, which matters because science matters, so there you go). The entire book is dedicated to dispelling the myths surrounding both sides of the creationism vs. evolution debate. Its longest chapter breaks down the ten best arguments for intelligent design (ID) and exposes them as unscientific religious propaganda. Shermer argues with tact, for the most part, avoiding the hyperbole one might expect in a book of this nature.The chapter covering ID in American public schools is particularly compelling for me because I have worked in a conservative school district where a dominant religion plays a huge role in what is taught in school. Shermer, a proud libertarian, would want a privatized school system where parents can choose to send their kids to whatever school they want, but he lays out his defense of evolution only science classrooms since most Americans are publicly schooled. He summarizes several court cases, and builds his defense primarily on the legal justification for evolution in the classroom. He explains that creationism can not be understood as science when we understand what science is."
105,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3038974-steve-van-slyke,4,"For those who have not read much about evolution or the debate between creationists and science this is a good place to start. On the other hand for those that have, it may seem a bit thin in some areas but even so he offers many new takes on the relation between the domains of science and religion. He also mentions and quotes several other authorities whose works go into evolution more deeply such as Dawkins, Margulis, Mayr, Gould, Fortey, Kenneth Miller, and others. He also comments on the writings of the main proponents of ID, such as Behe, Dembski, Meyer and Wells.At one point Shermer states that he was advised against debating proponents of Intelligent Design because it only served to give them credibility. As I read more of his analysis of the arguments on both sides I began to agree with his advisers. Nevertheless, Shermer makes the case that when the stakes become more than just winning a debate, when it comes down to whether science, or religion thinly disguised as science, will be taught in public schools, then someone has to step forward and shine the light of reason on the discussion.Shermer points out that is a relatively small minority of religious groups, primarily the 70% of evangelical Christians who do not accept evolution. The vast majority of mainstream Protestants and Catholics do accept evolution.He goes on to make the case that there are three possible approaches to the relationship between religion and science: 1) to make war on each other, 2) to combine, or 3) to co-exist in separate realms. The latter he says is the only rational option. “Believers can have both religion and science as long as...” they don't try to force the two together. “God is beyond the dominion of science, and science is outside the realm of God.”"
106,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1542839-mike,4,"This was quite a good defense of the neo-Darwinian synthesis. I think I tend to hold Michael Shermer in lower intellectual regard than, for example, Richard Dawkins, Daniel Dennett, or Stephen Gould. But this book is really an excellent, scholarly work. Like the best output by Carl Sagan, Shermer regards people's faith with seriousness and respect, at the same time using logic and evidence to build his own case. The book starts with a great, pocket description of what evolution is, and what natural selection is, followed by a list of the reasons that people use to reject it. He ranks these reasons by their intellectual rigor, then refutes them using science and the data that have been found since the 1800s. He deals with social Darwinism, the non-effect that Darwinism has on ethics and morals, it's non-attachment to nihilism. He then talks about debate tactics that intelligent design proponents use in debates against him, ranks them again, and points out the fallacy in each. He presents a case of why Christians should accept evolution, using the language of theology and even showing the influence of Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations on Darwin's work. The final chapter is a fascinating look at the actual modern controversies in evolution science, as opposed to those trumped up by ID supporters. Again, all in all, an excellent, concise use of philosophy, genetics, theology, biology, and history against the creeping ID movement. "
107,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6076331-ergun-coruh,4,"The publisher of Skeptic magazine was once an enthusiastic Evangelical Christian, but his ardent pursuit of a scientific education induced reconsideration. Now he staunchly advocates discriminating religion from science and in this book concisely defends evolutionary theory from the almost exclusively -Evangelical--Christian-backed concept of intelligent design (ID), aka creationism, aka creation science--the name changes whenever a suit over having public schools teach the idea as science gets shot down by a high U.S. court (the ID movement always appeals mere state-court decisions). Shermer debates ID often, and he expertly marshals point-by-point explanations of why evolution is worthwhile science, why ID isn't science at all, why ID criticisms of evolution are irrelevant, why science cannot invalidate religion, and why Christians and conservatives ought to accept evolution. His orderly presentation makes the book something of a reference manual on evolution, and only the historically minded will smile at his citation of congruence between evolution and Adam Smith as reason for conservatives to embrace evolution, for Smith's capitalism is a branch of classical liberalism.

But this was a good read as it breaks down the most common arguments against evolution and shows why biologists and naturalists reject and laugh at them. It's a good guide on how to argue with a creationist but things have changed since then and creationists are creating new arguments to justify their beliefs so this is a tip of the iceberg since creationists have some more arguments that this book doesn't cover, might need to do a little bit of research there. Along with covering all of the arguments and what your response should be to each, it also explains the different forms of creationism and intelligent design. Shermer might want to re-release it to provide updated information in the section explaining what we really don't know about evolution since a Google search into what we still don't know about evolution turns up a bunch of creationist sites and no actual answers to the question. If you are questioning the reasoning and logic behind the whole creationism thing then read this and decide which answer make sense between the science and the ideas from people that have no degrees in biology from a secular institution."

I'm giving it 4 stars because it's very informative and for the most part it's also enjoyable to read. Being a microbiologist and having previously read about ID I recognized many things in the text. However, I also understand that most people probably don't know so much about evolution or ID, and since ID is all about PR and propaganda it's easy to see that normal people don't immediately see it for what it is: a copy-paste of creationism with the word ""Designer"" replacing ""God"".This book is mainly aimed towards the American public, since it's in the US most of the Intelligent Design Movement exists. A big reason for this (also explained in the book) is the verdict of the Edwards v. Aguillard trial in 1987, where the US Supreme Court ruled that ""Teaching creationism in public schools is unconstitutional.."". This lead to the birth of the ""Intelligent Design Creationism"" and eventually a second court case, Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District in 2005, again with the court ruling that Intelligent Design is not science but merely Creationism pretending to be Science."
110,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1433053-james,4,"This was a very interesting primer on the evolution vs. intelligent design debate. It provides good talking points to arm yourself with if you plan to enter a debate with a creationist. It is interesting that the intelligent design movement is just a warmed over version of creationism that is trying to pose as scientific. Their main strategy so far has been to refute evolution. They do not have any research or evidence to back up any of their claims. The whole creationist mind set is based on ancient texts that can not be edited or updated when new evidence comes to light. Since they see the bible as the unerring word of God, they cannot incorporate the evidence of evolution because it renders their texts inaccurate. The creation myths of Genesis are understandable as a means for a Bronze Age civilization to explain their world. But given the tools and methods of science that we have now, there is no excuse to believe that the accounts of the worlds creation in the Bible are true. Get this book and read it. Then discuss with your creationist friends! "
111,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/828715-sonya-s,4,"Let's be fair: this is not a book for those already embroiled in the debates of creationism v. evolution. If you already have an in-depth knowledge of the theory of evolution, or have had extensive science classes, this book is not going to present any new material. However, I do recommend this book to people who are new to the debate, or to people who have just not thought about it that much.I'm a skeptic, and have read Mr. Shermer's various articles in Skeptic Magazine and through various skeptic websites, such as Skeptologists. Though I already knew most of the information presented, I found that Mr. Shermer was far less condescending than other skeptics I've read (I'm looking at you, Christopher Hitchens), and presented the material in an accessable, easy-to-understand matter. He carefully breaks down the sides of the argument and goes to show why evolution does, in fact, matter. What stuck with me the most, I think, was a question he posits somewhere towards the end of the book: why would anyone want to limit their deity to the physical realm in which we inhabit?"
112,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1264081-melydia,3,"I came away from this book with rather tepid feelings. It didn't feel like it flowed very well from point to point, and each point made felt glossed over, with a couple of bare sentences with a footnote. Shermer's survey of evolutionary biology was often unclear, but when he was in his element - that is, the psychology of belief and religiosity - the tone became smooth and easy to read. I especially liked his discussion of the evolution of morality and the Genesis revisit at the end. However, I found his discussion of logical fallacies fell flat, his responses to Intelligent Design arguments felt unsatisfying even to an evolutionist like myself, and he spent so much time referring to other books that I started to wonder what purpose there was in reading this one. I am not sure what the target audience of this book was, but I don't think I was part of it. Still, I do want to pick up some of Shermer's other works that fall closer to his own field of study. "
113,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51466379-morninglight-mama,3,"While I can't say with any shred of honesty that I understood the vast majority of this book, I can appreciate Shermer's emphasis on the so-called evolution vs. creationism or evolution vs. Intelligent Design debates. The simple bottom line is that evolution is science and both creationism and ID have no scientific basis, but are instead theological ideas and therefore do not belong in the same conversation of science. I know some people were turned off by his bouts of smugness or sarcasm throughout this book, but I could understand the frustration that could lead someone to communicate seemingly obvious arguments with a tinge of 'C'MON already!' I tried my best to get through the complex scientific jargon, but I mostly enjoyed the sections that discuss the more sociological perspectives of these 'conflicts' of ideas."
114,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/747149-jacob,2,"Honestly, I didn't finish this book. It offered no insight or argument that I already didn't know and understand. I'm also not sure how many people would find this book interesting. It's arguments against Intelligent Design from a former creationist. Creationists won't care what the arguments are and will avoid this on principle. Those with scientific interest and any basic knowledge should already understand this stuff. I guess there may be a market of undecided, open minded readers who aren't scientifically knowledgable, but are interested. In that circumstance, this would be a very good read. It's a slim book with clear, well-stated arguments, but I seriously doubt there are many people who would care or be interested who don't already know this stuff."
115,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/937966-mark,3,"Shermer has in the past presented ideas in an entertaining and inquisitive way. However, I think that that while this book certainly puts forward a clear argument why ID (Intelligent Design) fails, it does so with the caveat: there might still be something...Shermer is not an atheist, but an agnostic, and this book does not go the full route against Intelligent Design. That being said, the book is easy to read, and in the same style as Shermer's other excellent books such as Why People Believe Weird Things (a better book in my opinion). Intelligent Design fails absolutely as a scientific theory and Shermer makes that clear. However, the ""theory"" is still writhing in the dirt and Shermer walks away from the kill."
116,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61943-tamara,4,"Again, Shermer gets technical, but is still interesting. Not that I had to be convinced; evolution happened. One thing I like about Shermer is that he doesn't ridicule those who have religious faith, he just points out that the more literal sects (for instance, those who believe the Earth is only 10,000 years old) are just being stubbornly ignorant in ignoring irrefutable evidence that Earth is MUCH older than that. And he includes examples of scientists who have both strong religous faith and a belief in what science shows them to be true."
117,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/242253-sean-duffy,4,"There's nothing new here, but the text is clear and persuasive even though Shermer was preaching to the choir. I'm convinced that evolution happened and is happening (except for humans, for whom natural selection has been eliminated). ID's best arguments are explained and effectively dealt with. Still there persists the nagging question: why? As in, yes but, why? That question will remain unanswerable, and therein lies the only real argument for God. But this stuff about the Singularity is frightening. We should already be smashing the machines with our shoes."
118,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1447864-joshua-nomen-mutatio,4,"An excellent book to hand to those who deny the veracity of the continually enlarging body of evidence that supports biological evolution or think ""intelligently designed"" evolution is a well-supported idea, and even to those who say they believe that evolution is real yet don't quite understand why (a category which I've found many people fall under).Shermer is well-positioned to write towards the beliefs of the religious who think that evolutionary theory is bogus since he was once one them: Shermer was a evangelical Christian for a few years before rejecting the whole thing."
119,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/872094-pingpongabyss,3,"Decent book by Michael Shermer about the intelligent design debate. To be honest, I already knew all of the scientific issues from reading debates online, so I didn't learn much from it, but I do think the book probably does a good job at convincing people who are already at least leaning towards pro-evolution but don't know all the details yet. For those that are leaning the other way, there's not enough there. I also had to raise an eyebrow at some of Shermer's reasons as to why conservatives and Christians should be pro-evolution.

Most of the book seems to be some history and background which is interesting, but not particularly focused. Personally, this book is weaker in its arguments than something like Faith vs Fact and Why Evolution is True by Jerry Coyne. It's a simple book but would not be my recommendation for a book that deals with evolution. The best thing he does in this book is demonstrate that Intelligent Design is a weakly disguised Creationism and that's it."
128,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2318453-paul,2,"The AuthorMichael Shermer is a former fundamentalist Christian turned skeptic. In fact, he started The Skeptics Society and is the editor in chief of Skeptic magazine. Shermer got his B.A. in Psychology from Pepperdine (though he began as a theology major). He went on to get his Master's in Experimental Psychology from CSU-Fullerton, and his Ph.D in the History of Science from Claremont. Shermer is the classic case of a Christian who turned his back on the faith when confronted with facts and then took up a career as an apologist against the faith (see also Bart Ehrman).SummaryThis book lays out the history of the development of the theory of evolution, and also a brief history of Shermer's journey from fundamentalist Christian faith to accepting the theory of evolution as true. Shermer attempts to give reasons why people disagree with evolution (and believe in religion). I imagine much of this material found its source in his other book Why People Believe Weird Things. Shermer researches the reasons behind the Intelligent Design movement and interviews its greatest supporters and determines that Intelligent Design is really just Creationism revisited. From this he determines that the argument to get ID into schools is an attempt to push the Christian religious views down the throats of children. He carefully notes that all of the major proponents of Intelligent Design are evangelical Christians except one. He also notes that no other piece of science has ever resorted to using political power to force its inclusion into the curriculum. He then goes through the 10 best arguments for Intelligent Design and attempts to disprove them. He shows that Intelligent Design is all about proving evolution wrong and offers no contributions of its own.Shermer draws on his theological background to show why Christians should believe in evolution. He also argues for a Non Overlapping Magisteria view of the relationship between religion and science (a la Steven Jay Gould). In other words, science can't contradict religion and vice versa because science is about the natural world and religion is about the supernatural world.Shermer ends by introducing the 10 greatest problems with the theory of evolution and shows where change is expected and more research is needed.My TakeAs one would expect from a man with a Ph.D. in the History of Science, Shermer does a good job of presenting the gradual accumulation of evidence for evolution over time. He gives us brief insights into the history of the debate between evolution and Christianity, and gives us some quotes from Darwin himself to show how he wrestled with his own ideas and their implications. Shermer also does a nice job of showing how Intelligent Design is *not* science, and is not helpful to scientists. Science is based on methodological naturalism, the assumption that everything has a natural cause. This limitation in scope is what makes science so good at what it does. A scientist can never throw his hands up and say ""It must be God"". There is no room for miracles. So scientists will search for the solution to a problem for generations! Scientists will proceed by trial and error forever to figure something out. That is why science has done such a good job of explaining how our universe works.Intelligent Design wants us to base our science on methodological supernaturalism, the assumption that some things have supernatural causes. But any scientist can see that this robs the scientific method of its greatest strength: its persistence. Now, any scientist working on any problem can just raise his hands and cry ""I can't explain it. It must be a miracle!""The right thing to do is not to include miracles into science, it is to show people the inherent limitations of science. I agree with Shermer on this point. Intelligent Design is not science.So, the first three quarters of this book, in my opinion, correctly show the evidence for evolution, the problems with ID, the history of the debate, and the underlying rationale of the ID crowd. All of this is worth reading. (Caveat: The justification of religion on evolutionary terms is weak almost to the point of ridiculousness)After that the book goes downhill fast, both in terms of quality of thought and quantity of evidence. (Exception: Chapter 10 on the problems in evolution is both honest and well done.) Shermer's attempt to show how religion and science are compatible is terrible. Shermer ""shows"" how religion evolved to make our evolved morals work better. This ""showing"" involves mostly suggestions of how it could have happened. Then he sallies forth with some philosophy showing how science and religion should relate to one another (the NOMA principle ... which isn't that bad, it's just poorly argued for). Shermer fails to impress there too. Finally, he adds an appendix to show how science can fill the void left by religion because religion is all about awe and science can inspire awe. So science is the new religion. Which is kind of what one would expect from a guy who has lived as a Christian, and felt like his faith betrayed him, and is looking for something else. The appendix should be required reading for anyone who does not believe that we should start educating our children on how science fits into the big picture of life. "
129,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61808093-alexander-rivas,4,"Being a Christian, I wanted to start to understand this whole evolution versus creation debate. I decided to read this book where I learned about Darwin, the setbacks both sides face in our society, and how a Christian can believe in evolution without going against his beliefs. I enjoyed this book and never felt upset or angered by its content."
130,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43784978-tracie-nicolai,3,Interesting. There are a couple of troublesome premises offered. Well done on the Darwin insights and educational impacts. 
131,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11566185-alan,2,"Needless to say, I disagree with the stanch naturalistic presuppositional tone in which this book was written. However, I picked this book knowing what to expect. Given that Michael Shermer is a militant agnostic, I don't expect him to write much differently. Honestly, I like Mike Shermer because he genuinely seems like a down-to-earth guy. Unfortunately, like the other mainstream atheist authors, he paints any worldview that doesn't coincide with mainstream Darwinism as an anchor that will inevitably slow the progress of science. This is discouraging to read because it is a complete misrepresentation of reality. Shermer ideologically assumes that intelligent design (ID) is a religious attack on science. This message is continuously communicated throughout the book. In his view, ID is a conspiracy against the ""scientific community"" (notice the presupposition that ID has nothing to add to the scientific dialogue) to demote science from a objective methodology of gathering information, testing hypothesis, etc... to throwing Bibles at children in schools. With this message being present throughout the book, it almost appears that regardless of what advocates of ID bring to the table, they will be dismissed before their ideas are even considered. It seems to be a philosophical commitment to rejecting anything with the possibility of a designer rather than being open to conclusions based on evidence, despite implications of a designer. Shermer attempts to take on some common ID arguments for the possibility of a designer. For example, the fine-tuning argument, as he admits, is the strongest argument for the existence of a designer. However, his treatment of it is horribly insufficient, especially when he is attempting to make 'the case against ID'. He treats to argument with sentiments like, 'the vast universe is empty space', 'the majority of the universe is inhospitable to life', and 'it is only in recent to time that the universe became finely tuned for life', just to name the highlights. He then resorted to saying that since the multiverse is a probable theory, of a potentially infinite amount of universes that exist, it's not surprising to see life existing under these types of improbable conditions. Clearly, it is irrelevant how occupied our universe is with life in order for it to be fine-tuned. Fine-tuning isn't contingent on the presence of life, life is contingent on the existence of fine-tuning. Without the presence of fine-tuning, the universe wouldn't be habitable. Since he has provided an insufficient refutation of fine-tuning, predictably, he enacted the multiverse theory to counteract the incomprehensibly improbable existence of fine-tuning of the universe for life. Despite what people like Shermer say about the speculative existence of a multiverse, there is no evidence for it and it plays a god-like figure in the ideologies of skeptics. Shermer attempted to treat the moral component of evolution near the end of the book. He declares that since objective morals exist, they are the result of biological evolution for the purposes of survivability. Under a Darwinian worldview, if true, they would have developed under the process of evolution and social conditioning. However, morals would not be objective. Meaning, there would not be a transcendent source for morality in which to judge moral actions. Essentially, no reference point in which to gauge moral good vs. bad. Shermer fails to address the ontological basis for morals under a Darwinian worldview. Maybe he completely overlooked it on the basis of this fact. A worldview is never appealing when you tell your adherents that there is no objective moral difference between Mother Theresa and Hitler.Overall, it was a good summary of the Darwinian point of view. Shermer is a good and qualified representative of this worldview. In my own opinion, it appeared that the ID position and overall ID motive on most matters was misrepresented to make the Darwinian position look better. Like I said, it's a mainstream book and you have to decipher the fact vs. the fiction."
132,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/369290-the-other-john,2,"The conflict between evolution and intelligent design is one of the warmer issues of the day. Since reading 
Darwin on Trial
, I've been in the design camp, but I've never been completely comfortable there. There's been too many times when a person whose opinions I respect blasts into intelligent design and I fumble about looking for an excuse for my position. And when some ardent supporter of my side starts laying on the propaganda, I likewise wince. So while I was back overseas, one thing I decided I should do upon my return to the land of the free and home of the public library was do some more digging on evolution. Specifically, I wanted to get some more info on how a supporter of evolution would respond to the main arguments of the design side. Well, this book was my first attempt at getting more info. Mr. Shermer was helpful in clearing away some of the confusion in my mind, but didn't draw me any closer to the evolution camp. The biggest favor that Mr. Shermer did was point out that the leading proponents of intelligent design are really creationists trying to sell their beliefs in a new package. I don't care for sales pitches regardless of who's doing the selling. That's the main reason why I would rate the book as waiting room material, despite the useful information it contains. Mr. Shermer has his own agenda to promote. As for the meat of the debate, I get the impression that, like the abortion conflict, the problem lies in the conflict of two different issues. By definition, science excludes the supernatural. If you can't observe it, measure it, study it, then you can't assume it exists. To bring divine revelation, namely, the Bible, into the science classroom, is a violation of the scientific method. I think what happened over the years in Western society is that many people have started to consider the scientific method the only source of authoritative knowledge. So while any good scientist will tell you that any scientific law or theory might be proven wrong some day, they will proceed to live as if the accepted laws and theories are the truth. Just as I live as if the Bible is the truth. So where does this leave me? Well, I wouldn't mind digging up some more info on evolution. I'm curious about the fossil record and just how many of the bones in the skeletons are real and how many have been imagined to fill in the gaps. But I also realize that I'm never going to have a simple, irrefutable argument as to why we should believe we're created. In the end, only the Creator can prove He exists."
133,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18061078-emma,1,"This book isn't about ""Why Darwin Matters"", it's an overview of what Intelligent Design is, how it's been used as a Trojan horse to try and sneak creationism into science, what its arguments are and why they're easy to debunk, etc. Shermer includes a lot of little factoids that are simplified to the point of being wrong, such as defining sexual selection as nothing more than female choice (although he does at least mention that other aspects of sexual selection exist in a later chapter) and saying things like ""ever since Darwin, [people have had an idea that was around long before Darwin]"". In a chapter focused mainly around why Christians shouldn't turn to intelligent design (because most of the ""Intelligent Design"" groups are run by evangelical Christians), he goes off on a random tangent about monogamy in which he projects his personal opinions onto nature with no evidence from biological research and demonizes men in the process (I know people throw around empty accusations of ""demonizing men"" whenever someone brings up sexism or toxic masculinity, but Shermer actually does it, along with infantilizing women and misinterpreting a study of college students in order to perpetuate the ""coy females"" stereotype that's been sneaking into biology for a while). Then, in the same chapter, he throws in a section about conservatives for some unknown reason (?) and starts rambling about Adam Smith and seems to argue for Social Darwinism, and makes up some nonsense about how evolution supposedly promotes some Malthusian, social Darwinist, extremely anti-Christian views (in the same chapter where he's trying to recruit Christians). There's no possible way this argument was written in good faith, because he's obviously done enough research to know that Darwinism isn't the same as Social Darwinism -- and even if it were, it's not something you should be promoting. Trying to get people to accept evolution by telling them that it will let them make up a pseudo-scientific argument in favor of whatever they already want to do, whether it's monogamy or laissez-faire economics or eugenics or anything else, is not an argument for evolution. Some parts of this book are pretty good as a basic overview of the topic (which is ""what's the Intelligent Design debate all about?"", not ""why does Darwin matter?""), but there are far better sources out there for this information, and I can't think of a reason to read this book when you could read almost anything else on the topic."
134,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3648143-rob,4,"When Michael Shermer surveyed people about their religious beliefs, asking them why they believed in God and why they thought other people believe in God, he found that people tend to invoke intellectual causes for their personal beliefs and assign emotional causes for the beliefs of others. While this trend may not be true for all people, a majority of people sampled exhibit this textbook attribution bias. I am certainly guilty of this, even to the point where I can’t help but question if my reading of this book is evidence of a further bias, the confirmation bias--a prejudice in which I form an opinion and seek out information that supports my already held beliefs thus reinforcing my supposed intellectualism on the topic. I can partly blame Mr. Shermer for my acute neuroticism. It was, after all, his book, The Believing Brain, that introduced me to most of the concepts that now affect my thinking. But, I don’t think this is a bad thing. Skepticism is a healthy attribute. Shermer’s book, Why Darwin Matters: The Case Against Intelligent Design does a much better job expounding on its subtitle than it’s primary title. It is not until the last page that Shermer reveals why Darwin matters (it’s because evolution matters, which matters because science matters, so there you go). The entire book is dedicated to dispelling the myths surrounding both sides of the creationism vs. evolution debate. Its longest chapter breaks down the ten best arguments for intelligent design (ID) and exposes them as unscientific religious propaganda. Shermer argues with tact, for the most part, avoiding the hyperbole one might expect in a book of this nature.The chapter covering ID in American public schools is particularly compelling for me because I have worked in a conservative school district where a dominant religion plays a huge role in what is taught in school. Shermer, a proud libertarian, would want a privatized school system where parents can choose to send their kids to whatever school they want, but he lays out his defense of evolution only science classrooms since most Americans are publicly schooled. He summarizes several court cases, and builds his defense primarily on the legal justification for evolution in the classroom. He explains that creationism can not be understood as science when we understand what science is."
135,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3038974-steve-van-slyke,4,"For those who have not read much about evolution or the debate between creationists and science this is a good place to start. On the other hand for those that have, it may seem a bit thin in some areas but even so he offers many new takes on the relation between the domains of science and religion. He also mentions and quotes several other authorities whose works go into evolution more deeply such as Dawkins, Margulis, Mayr, Gould, Fortey, Kenneth Miller, and others. He also comments on the writings of the main proponents of ID, such as Behe, Dembski, Meyer and Wells.At one point Shermer states that he was advised against debating proponents of Intelligent Design because it only served to give them credibility. As I read more of his analysis of the arguments on both sides I began to agree with his advisers. Nevertheless, Shermer makes the case that when the stakes become more than just winning a debate, when it comes down to whether science, or religion thinly disguised as science, will be taught in public schools, then someone has to step forward and shine the light of reason on the discussion.Shermer points out that is a relatively small minority of religious groups, primarily the 70% of evangelical Christians who do not accept evolution. The vast majority of mainstream Protestants and Catholics do accept evolution.He goes on to make the case that there are three possible approaches to the relationship between religion and science: 1) to make war on each other, 2) to combine, or 3) to co-exist in separate realms. The latter he says is the only rational option. “Believers can have both religion and science as long as...” they don't try to force the two together. “God is beyond the dominion of science, and science is outside the realm of God.”"
136,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1542839-mike,4,"This was quite a good defense of the neo-Darwinian synthesis. I think I tend to hold Michael Shermer in lower intellectual regard than, for example, Richard Dawkins, Daniel Dennett, or Stephen Gould. But this book is really an excellent, scholarly work. Like the best output by Carl Sagan, Shermer regards people's faith with seriousness and respect, at the same time using logic and evidence to build his own case. The book starts with a great, pocket description of what evolution is, and what natural selection is, followed by a list of the reasons that people use to reject it. He ranks these reasons by their intellectual rigor, then refutes them using science and the data that have been found since the 1800s. He deals with social Darwinism, the non-effect that Darwinism has on ethics and morals, it's non-attachment to nihilism. He then talks about debate tactics that intelligent design proponents use in debates against him, ranks them again, and points out the fallacy in each. He presents a case of why Christians should accept evolution, using the language of theology and even showing the influence of Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations on Darwin's work. The final chapter is a fascinating look at the actual modern controversies in evolution science, as opposed to those trumped up by ID supporters. Again, all in all, an excellent, concise use of philosophy, genetics, theology, biology, and history against the creeping ID movement. "
137,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6076331-ergun-coruh,4,"The publisher of Skeptic magazine was once an enthusiastic Evangelical Christian, but his ardent pursuit of a scientific education induced reconsideration. Now he staunchly advocates discriminating religion from science and in this book concisely defends evolutionary theory from the almost exclusively -Evangelical--Christian-backed concept of intelligent design (ID), aka creationism, aka creation science--the name changes whenever a suit over having public schools teach the idea as science gets shot down by a high U.S. court (the ID movement always appeals mere state-court decisions). Shermer debates ID often, and he expertly marshals point-by-point explanations of why evolution is worthwhile science, why ID isn't science at all, why ID criticisms of evolution are irrelevant, why science cannot invalidate religion, and why Christians and conservatives ought to accept evolution. His orderly presentation makes the book something of a reference manual on evolution, and only the historically minded will smile at his citation of congruence between evolution and Adam Smith as reason for conservatives to embrace evolution, for Smith's capitalism is a branch of classical liberalism.

But this was a good read as it breaks down the most common arguments against evolution and shows why biologists and naturalists reject and laugh at them. It's a good guide on how to argue with a creationist but things have changed since then and creationists are creating new arguments to justify their beliefs so this is a tip of the iceberg since creationists have some more arguments that this book doesn't cover, might need to do a little bit of research there. Along with covering all of the arguments and what your response should be to each, it also explains the different forms of creationism and intelligent design. Shermer might want to re-release it to provide updated information in the section explaining what we really don't know about evolution since a Google search into what we still don't know about evolution turns up a bunch of creationist sites and no actual answers to the question. If you are questioning the reasoning and logic behind the whole creationism thing then read this and decide which answer make sense between the science and the ideas from people that have no degrees in biology from a secular institution."

I'm giving it 4 stars because it's very informative and for the most part it's also enjoyable to read. Being a microbiologist and having previously read about ID I recognized many things in the text. However, I also understand that most people probably don't know so much about evolution or ID, and since ID is all about PR and propaganda it's easy to see that normal people don't immediately see it for what it is: a copy-paste of creationism with the word ""Designer"" replacing ""God"".This book is mainly aimed towards the American public, since it's in the US most of the Intelligent Design Movement exists. A big reason for this (also explained in the book) is the verdict of the Edwards v. Aguillard trial in 1987, where the US Supreme Court ruled that ""Teaching creationism in public schools is unconstitutional.."". This lead to the birth of the ""Intelligent Design Creationism"" and eventually a second court case, Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District in 2005, again with the court ruling that Intelligent Design is not science but merely Creationism pretending to be Science."
140,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1433053-james,4,"This was a very interesting primer on the evolution vs. intelligent design debate. It provides good talking points to arm yourself with if you plan to enter a debate with a creationist. It is interesting that the intelligent design movement is just a warmed over version of creationism that is trying to pose as scientific. Their main strategy so far has been to refute evolution. They do not have any research or evidence to back up any of their claims. The whole creationist mind set is based on ancient texts that can not be edited or updated when new evidence comes to light. Since they see the bible as the unerring word of God, they cannot incorporate the evidence of evolution because it renders their texts inaccurate. The creation myths of Genesis are understandable as a means for a Bronze Age civilization to explain their world. But given the tools and methods of science that we have now, there is no excuse to believe that the accounts of the worlds creation in the Bible are true. Get this book and read it. Then discuss with your creationist friends! "
141,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/828715-sonya-s,4,"Let's be fair: this is not a book for those already embroiled in the debates of creationism v. evolution. If you already have an in-depth knowledge of the theory of evolution, or have had extensive science classes, this book is not going to present any new material. However, I do recommend this book to people who are new to the debate, or to people who have just not thought about it that much.I'm a skeptic, and have read Mr. Shermer's various articles in Skeptic Magazine and through various skeptic websites, such as Skeptologists. Though I already knew most of the information presented, I found that Mr. Shermer was far less condescending than other skeptics I've read (I'm looking at you, Christopher Hitchens), and presented the material in an accessable, easy-to-understand matter. He carefully breaks down the sides of the argument and goes to show why evolution does, in fact, matter. What stuck with me the most, I think, was a question he posits somewhere towards the end of the book: why would anyone want to limit their deity to the physical realm in which we inhabit?"
142,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1264081-melydia,3,"I came away from this book with rather tepid feelings. It didn't feel like it flowed very well from point to point, and each point made felt glossed over, with a couple of bare sentences with a footnote. Shermer's survey of evolutionary biology was often unclear, but when he was in his element - that is, the psychology of belief and religiosity - the tone became smooth and easy to read. I especially liked his discussion of the evolution of morality and the Genesis revisit at the end. However, I found his discussion of logical fallacies fell flat, his responses to Intelligent Design arguments felt unsatisfying even to an evolutionist like myself, and he spent so much time referring to other books that I started to wonder what purpose there was in reading this one. I am not sure what the target audience of this book was, but I don't think I was part of it. Still, I do want to pick up some of Shermer's other works that fall closer to his own field of study. "
143,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51466379-morninglight-mama,3,"While I can't say with any shred of honesty that I understood the vast majority of this book, I can appreciate Shermer's emphasis on the so-called evolution vs. creationism or evolution vs. Intelligent Design debates. The simple bottom line is that evolution is science and both creationism and ID have no scientific basis, but are instead theological ideas and therefore do not belong in the same conversation of science. I know some people were turned off by his bouts of smugness or sarcasm throughout this book, but I could understand the frustration that could lead someone to communicate seemingly obvious arguments with a tinge of 'C'MON already!' I tried my best to get through the complex scientific jargon, but I mostly enjoyed the sections that discuss the more sociological perspectives of these 'conflicts' of ideas."
144,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/747149-jacob,2,"Honestly, I didn't finish this book. It offered no insight or argument that I already didn't know and understand. I'm also not sure how many people would find this book interesting. It's arguments against Intelligent Design from a former creationist. Creationists won't care what the arguments are and will avoid this on principle. Those with scientific interest and any basic knowledge should already understand this stuff. I guess there may be a market of undecided, open minded readers who aren't scientifically knowledgable, but are interested. In that circumstance, this would be a very good read. It's a slim book with clear, well-stated arguments, but I seriously doubt there are many people who would care or be interested who don't already know this stuff."
145,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/937966-mark,3,"Shermer has in the past presented ideas in an entertaining and inquisitive way. However, I think that that while this book certainly puts forward a clear argument why ID (Intelligent Design) fails, it does so with the caveat: there might still be something...Shermer is not an atheist, but an agnostic, and this book does not go the full route against Intelligent Design. That being said, the book is easy to read, and in the same style as Shermer's other excellent books such as Why People Believe Weird Things (a better book in my opinion). Intelligent Design fails absolutely as a scientific theory and Shermer makes that clear. However, the ""theory"" is still writhing in the dirt and Shermer walks away from the kill."
146,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61943-tamara,4,"Again, Shermer gets technical, but is still interesting. Not that I had to be convinced; evolution happened. One thing I like about Shermer is that he doesn't ridicule those who have religious faith, he just points out that the more literal sects (for instance, those who believe the Earth is only 10,000 years old) are just being stubbornly ignorant in ignoring irrefutable evidence that Earth is MUCH older than that. And he includes examples of scientists who have both strong religous faith and a belief in what science shows them to be true."
147,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/242253-sean-duffy,4,"There's nothing new here, but the text is clear and persuasive even though Shermer was preaching to the choir. I'm convinced that evolution happened and is happening (except for humans, for whom natural selection has been eliminated). ID's best arguments are explained and effectively dealt with. Still there persists the nagging question: why? As in, yes but, why? That question will remain unanswerable, and therein lies the only real argument for God. But this stuff about the Singularity is frightening. We should already be smashing the machines with our shoes."

To be honest, I already knew all of the scientific issues from reading debates online, so I didn't learn much from it, but I do think the book probably does a good job at convincing people who are already at least leaning towards pro-evolution but don't know all the details yet. For those that are leaning the other way, there's not enough there. I also had to raise an eyebrow at some of Shermer's reasons as to why conservatives and Christians should be pro-evolution.

Most of the book seems to be some history and background which is interesting, but not particularly focused. Personally, this book is weaker in its arguments than something like Faith vs Fact and Why Evolution is True by Jerry Coyne. It's a simple book but would not be my recommendation for a book that deals with evolution. The best thing he does in this book is demonstrate that Intelligent Design is a weakly disguised Creationism and that's it."
158,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2318453-paul,2,"The AuthorMichael Shermer is a former fundamentalist Christian turned skeptic. In fact, he started The Skeptics Society and is the editor in chief of Skeptic magazine. Shermer got his B.A. in Psychology from Pepperdine (though he began as a theology major). He went on to get his Master's in Experimental Psychology from CSU-Fullerton, and his Ph.D in the History of Science from Claremont. Shermer is the classic case of a Christian who turned his back on the faith when confronted with facts and then took up a career as an apologist against the faith (see also Bart Ehrman).SummaryThis book lays out the history of the development of the theory of evolution, and also a brief history of Shermer's journey from fundamentalist Christian faith to accepting the theory of evolution as true. Shermer attempts to give reasons why people disagree with evolution (and believe in religion). I imagine much of this material found its source in his other book Why People Believe Weird Things. Shermer researches the reasons behind the Intelligent Design movement and interviews its greatest supporters and determines that Intelligent Design is really just Creationism revisited. From this he determines that the argument to get ID into schools is an attempt to push the Christian religious views down the throats of children. He carefully notes that all of the major proponents of Intelligent Design are evangelical Christians except one. He also notes that no other piece of science has ever resorted to using political power to force its inclusion into the curriculum. He then goes through the 10 best arguments for Intelligent Design and attempts to disprove them. He shows that Intelligent Design is all about proving evolution wrong and offers no contributions of its own.Shermer draws on his theological background to show why Christians should believe in evolution. He also argues for a Non Overlapping Magisteria view of the relationship between religion and science (a la Steven Jay Gould). In other words, science can't contradict religion and vice versa because science is about the natural world and religion is about the supernatural world.Shermer ends by introducing the 10 greatest problems with the theory of evolution and shows where change is expected and more research is needed.My TakeAs one would expect from a man with a Ph.D. in the History of Science, Shermer does a good job of presenting the gradual accumulation of evidence for evolution over time. He gives us brief insights into the history of the debate between evolution and Christianity, and gives us some quotes from Darwin himself to show how he wrestled with his own ideas and their implications. Shermer also does a nice job of showing how Intelligent Design is *not* science, and is not helpful to scientists. Science is based on methodological naturalism, the assumption that everything has a natural cause. This limitation in scope is what makes science so good at what it does. A scientist can never throw his hands up and say ""It must be God"". There is no room for miracles. So scientists will search for the solution to a problem for generations! Scientists will proceed by trial and error forever to figure something out. That is why science has done such a good job of explaining how our universe works.Intelligent Design wants us to base our science on methodological supernaturalism, the assumption that some things have supernatural causes. But any scientist can see that this robs the scientific method of its greatest strength: its persistence. Now, any scientist working on any problem can just raise his hands and cry ""I can't explain it. It must be a miracle!""The right thing to do is not to include miracles into science, it is to show people the inherent limitations of science. I agree with Shermer on this point. Intelligent Design is not science.So, the first three quarters of this book, in my opinion, correctly show the evidence for evolution, the problems with ID, the history of the debate, and the underlying rationale of the ID crowd. All of this is worth reading. (Caveat: The justification of religion on evolutionary terms is weak almost to the point of ridiculousness)After that the book goes downhill fast, both in terms of quality of thought and quantity of evidence. (Exception: Chapter 10 on the problems in evolution is both honest and well done.) Shermer's attempt to show how religion and science are compatible is terrible. Shermer ""shows"" how religion evolved to make our evolved morals work better. This ""showing"" involves mostly suggestions of how it could have happened. Then he sallies forth with some philosophy showing how science and religion should relate to one another (the NOMA principle ... which isn't that bad, it's just poorly argued for). Shermer fails to impress there too. Finally, he adds an appendix to show how science can fill the void left by religion because religion is all about awe and science can inspire awe. So science is the new religion. Which is kind of what one would expect from a guy who has lived as a Christian, and felt like his faith betrayed him, and is looking for something else. The appendix should be required reading for anyone who does not believe that we should start educating our children on how science fits into the big picture of life. "
159,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61808093-alexander-rivas,4,"Being a Christian, I wanted to start to understand this whole evolution versus creation debate. I decided to read this book where I learned about Darwin, the setbacks both sides face in our society, and how a Christian can believe in evolution without going against his beliefs. I enjoyed this book and never felt upset or angered by its content."
160,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43784978-tracie-nicolai,3,Interesting. There are a couple of troublesome premises offered. Well done on the Darwin insights and educational impacts. 
161,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11566185-alan,2,"Needless to say, I disagree with the stanch naturalistic presuppositional tone in which this book was written. However, I picked this book knowing what to expect. Given that Michael Shermer is a militant agnostic, I don't expect him to write much differently. Honestly, I like Mike Shermer because he genuinely seems like a down-to-earth guy. Unfortunately, like the other mainstream atheist authors, he paints any worldview that doesn't coincide with mainstream Darwinism as an anchor that will inevitably slow the progress of science. This is discouraging to read because it is a complete misrepresentation of reality. Shermer ideologically assumes that intelligent design (ID) is a religious attack on science. This message is continuously communicated throughout the book. In his view, ID is a conspiracy against the ""scientific community"" (notice the presupposition that ID has nothing to add to the scientific dialogue) to demote science from a objective methodology of gathering information, testing hypothesis, etc... to throwing Bibles at children in schools. With this message being present throughout the book, it almost appears that regardless of what advocates of ID bring to the table, they will be dismissed before their ideas are even considered. It seems to be a philosophical commitment to rejecting anything with the possibility of a designer rather than being open to conclusions based on evidence, despite implications of a designer. Shermer attempts to take on some common ID arguments for the possibility of a designer. For example, the fine-tuning argument, as he admits, is the strongest argument for the existence of a designer. However, his treatment of it is horribly insufficient, especially when he is attempting to make 'the case against ID'. He treats to argument with sentiments like, 'the vast universe is empty space', 'the majority of the universe is inhospitable to life', and 'it is only in recent to time that the universe became finely tuned for life', just to name the highlights. He then resorted to saying that since the multiverse is a probable theory, of a potentially infinite amount of universes that exist, it's not surprising to see life existing under these types of improbable conditions. Clearly, it is irrelevant how occupied our universe is with life in order for it to be fine-tuned. Fine-tuning isn't contingent on the presence of life, life is contingent on the existence of fine-tuning. Without the presence of fine-tuning, the universe wouldn't be habitable. Since he has provided an insufficient refutation of fine-tuning, predictably, he enacted the multiverse theory to counteract the incomprehensibly improbable existence of fine-tuning of the universe for life. Despite what people like Shermer say about the speculative existence of a multiverse, there is no evidence for it and it plays a god-like figure in the ideologies of skeptics. Shermer attempted to treat the moral component of evolution near the end of the book. He declares that since objective morals exist, they are the result of biological evolution for the purposes of survivability. Under a Darwinian worldview, if true, they would have developed under the process of evolution and social conditioning. However, morals would not be objective. Meaning, there would not be a transcendent source for morality in which to judge moral actions. Essentially, no reference point in which to gauge moral good vs. bad. Shermer fails to address the ontological basis for morals under a Darwinian worldview. Maybe he completely overlooked it on the basis of this fact. A worldview is never appealing when you tell your adherents that there is no objective moral difference between Mother Theresa and Hitler.Overall, it was a good summary of the Darwinian point of view. Shermer is a good and qualified representative of this worldview. In my own opinion, it appeared that the ID position and overall ID motive on most matters was misrepresented to make the Darwinian position look better. Like I said, it's a mainstream book and you have to decipher the fact vs. the fiction."
162,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/369290-the-other-john,2,"The conflict between evolution and intelligent design is one of the warmer issues of the day. Since reading 
Darwin on Trial
, I've been in the design camp, but I've never been completely comfortable there. There's been too many times when a person whose opinions I respect blasts into intelligent design and I fumble about looking for an excuse for my position. And when some ardent supporter of my side starts laying on the propaganda, I likewise wince. So while I was back overseas, one thing I decided I should do upon my return to the land of the free and home of the public library was do some more digging on evolution. Specifically, I wanted to get some more info on how a supporter of evolution would respond to the main arguments of the design side. Well, this book was my first attempt at getting more info. Mr. Shermer was helpful in clearing away some of the confusion in my mind, but didn't draw me any closer to the evolution camp. The biggest favor that Mr. Shermer did was point out that the leading proponents of intelligent design are really creationists trying to sell their beliefs in a new package. I don't care for sales pitches regardless of who's doing the selling. That's the main reason why I would rate the book as waiting room material, despite the useful information it contains. Mr. Shermer has his own agenda to promote. As for the meat of the debate, I get the impression that, like the abortion conflict, the problem lies in the conflict of two different issues. By definition, science excludes the supernatural. If you can't observe it, measure it, study it, then you can't assume it exists. To bring divine revelation, namely, the Bible, into the science classroom, is a violation of the scientific method. I think what happened over the years in Western society is that many people have started to consider the scientific method the only source of authoritative knowledge. So while any good scientist will tell you that any scientific law or theory might be proven wrong some day, they will proceed to live as if the accepted laws and theories are the truth. Just as I live as if the Bible is the truth. So where does this leave me? Well, I wouldn't mind digging up some more info on evolution. I'm curious about the fossil record and just how many of the bones in the skeletons are real and how many have been imagined to fill in the gaps. But I also realize that I'm never going to have a simple, irrefutable argument as to why we should believe we're created. In the end, only the Creator can prove He exists."
163,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18061078-emma,1,"This book isn't about ""Why Darwin Matters"", it's an overview of what Intelligent Design is, how it's been used as a Trojan horse to try and sneak creationism into science, what its arguments are and why they're easy to debunk, etc. Shermer includes a lot of little factoids that are simplified to the point of being wrong, such as defining sexual selection as nothing more than female choice (although he does at least mention that other aspects of sexual selection exist in a later chapter) and saying things like ""ever since Darwin, [people have had an idea that was around long before Darwin]"". In a chapter focused mainly around why Christians shouldn't turn to intelligent design (because most of the ""Intelligent Design"" groups are run by evangelical Christians), he goes off on a random tangent about monogamy in which he projects his personal opinions onto nature with no evidence from biological research and demonizes men in the process (I know people throw around empty accusations of ""demonizing men"" whenever someone brings up sexism or toxic masculinity, but Shermer actually does it, along with infantilizing women and misinterpreting a study of college students in order to perpetuate the ""coy females"" stereotype that's been sneaking into biology for a while). Then, in the same chapter, he throws in a section about conservatives for some unknown reason (?) and starts rambling about Adam Smith and seems to argue for Social Darwinism, and makes up some nonsense about how evolution supposedly promotes some Malthusian, social Darwinist, extremely anti-Christian views (in the same chapter where he's trying to recruit Christians). There's no possible way this argument was written in good faith, because he's obviously done enough research to know that Darwinism isn't the same as Social Darwinism -- and even if it were, it's not something you should be promoting. Trying to get people to accept evolution by telling them that it will let them make up a pseudo-scientific argument in favor of whatever they already want to do, whether it's monogamy or laissez-faire economics or eugenics or anything else, is not an argument for evolution. Some parts of this book are pretty good as a basic overview of the topic (which is ""what's the Intelligent Design debate all about?"", not ""why does Darwin matter?""), but there are far better sources out there for this information, and I can't think of a reason to read this book when you could read almost anything else on the topic."
164,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3648143-rob,4,"When Michael Shermer surveyed people about their religious beliefs, asking them why they believed in God and why they thought other people believe in God, he found that people tend to invoke intellectual causes for their personal beliefs and assign emotional causes for the beliefs of others. While this trend may not be true for all people, a majority of people sampled exhibit this textbook attribution bias. I am certainly guilty of this, even to the point where I can’t help but question if my reading of this book is evidence of a further bias, the confirmation bias--a prejudice in which I form an opinion and seek out information that supports my already held beliefs thus reinforcing my supposed intellectualism on the topic. I can partly blame Mr. Shermer for my acute neuroticism. It was, after all, his book, The Believing Brain, that introduced me to most of the concepts that now affect my thinking. But, I don’t think this is a bad thing. Skepticism is a healthy attribute. Shermer’s book, Why Darwin Matters: The Case Against Intelligent Design does a much better job expounding on its subtitle than it’s primary title. It is not until the last page that Shermer reveals why Darwin matters (it’s because evolution matters, which matters because science matters, so there you go). The entire book is dedicated to dispelling the myths surrounding both sides of the creationism vs. evolution debate. Its longest chapter breaks down the ten best arguments for intelligent design (ID) and exposes them as unscientific religious propaganda. Shermer argues with tact, for the most part, avoiding the hyperbole one might expect in a book of this nature.The chapter covering ID in American public schools is particularly compelling for me because I have worked in a conservative school district where a dominant religion plays a huge role in what is taught in school. Shermer, a proud libertarian, would want a privatized school system where parents can choose to send their kids to whatever school they want, but he lays out his defense of evolution only science classrooms since most Americans are publicly schooled. He summarizes several court cases, and builds his defense primarily on the legal justification for evolution in the classroom. He explains that creationism can not be understood as science when we understand what science is."
165,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3038974-steve-van-slyke,4,"For those who have not read much about evolution or the debate between creationists and science this is a good place to start. On the other hand for those that have, it may seem a bit thin in some areas but even so he offers many new takes on the relation between the domains of science and religion. He also mentions and quotes several other authorities whose works go into evolution more deeply such as Dawkins, Margulis, Mayr, Gould, Fortey, Kenneth Miller, and others. He also comments on the writings of the main proponents of ID, such as Behe, Dembski, Meyer and Wells.At one point Shermer states that he was advised against debating proponents of Intelligent Design because it only served to give them credibility. As I read more of his analysis of the arguments on both sides I began to agree with his advisers. Nevertheless, Shermer makes the case that when the stakes become more than just winning a debate, when it comes down to whether science, or religion thinly disguised as science, will be taught in public schools, then someone has to step forward and shine the light of reason on the discussion.Shermer points out that is a relatively small minority of religious groups, primarily the 70% of evangelical Christians who do not accept evolution. The vast majority of mainstream Protestants and Catholics do accept evolution.He goes on to make the case that there are three possible approaches to the relationship between religion and science: 1) to make war on each other, 2) to combine, or 3) to co-exist in separate realms. The latter he says is the only rational option. “Believers can have both religion and science as long as...” they don't try to force the two together. “God is beyond the dominion of science, and science is outside the realm of God.”"
166,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1542839-mike,4,"This was quite a good defense of the neo-Darwinian synthesis. I think I tend to hold Michael Shermer in lower intellectual regard than, for example, Richard Dawkins, Daniel Dennett, or Stephen Gould. But this book is really an excellent, scholarly work. Like the best output by Carl Sagan, Shermer regards people's faith with seriousness and respect, at the same time using logic and evidence to build his own case. The book starts with a great, pocket description of what evolution is, and what natural selection is, followed by a list of the reasons that people use to reject it. He ranks these reasons by their intellectual rigor, then refutes them using science and the data that have been found since the 1800s. He deals with social Darwinism, the non-effect that Darwinism has on ethics and morals, it's non-attachment to nihilism. He then talks about debate tactics that intelligent design proponents use in debates against him, ranks them again, and points out the fallacy in each. He presents a case of why Christians should accept evolution, using the language of theology and even showing the influence of Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations on Darwin's work. The final chapter is a fascinating look at the actual modern controversies in evolution science, as opposed to those trumped up by ID supporters. Again, all in all, an excellent, concise use of philosophy, genetics, theology, biology, and history against the creeping ID movement. "
167,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6076331-ergun-coruh,4,"The publisher of Skeptic magazine was once an enthusiastic Evangelical Christian, but his ardent pursuit of a scientific education induced reconsideration. Now he staunchly advocates discriminating religion from science and in this book concisely defends evolutionary theory from the almost exclusively -Evangelical--Christian-backed concept of intelligent design (ID), aka creationism, aka creation science--the name changes whenever a suit over having public schools teach the idea as science gets shot down by a high U.S. court (the ID movement always appeals mere state-court decisions). Shermer debates ID often, and he expertly marshals point-by-point explanations of why evolution is worthwhile science, why ID isn't science at all, why ID criticisms of evolution are irrelevant, why science cannot invalidate religion, and why Christians and conservatives ought to accept evolution. His orderly presentation makes the book something of a reference manual on evolution, and only the historically minded will smile at his citation of congruence between evolution and Adam Smith as reason for conservatives to embrace evolution, for Smith's capitalism is a branch of classical liberalism.

But this was a good read as it breaks down the most common arguments against evolution and shows why biologists and naturalists reject and laugh at them. It's a good guide on how to argue with a creationist but things have changed since then and creationists are creating new arguments to justify their beliefs so this is a tip of the iceberg since creationists have some more arguments that this book doesn't cover, might need to do a little bit of research there. Along with covering all of the arguments and what your response should be to each, it also explains the different forms of creationism and intelligent design. Shermer might want to re-release it to provide updated information in the section explaining what we really don't know about evolution since a Google search into what we still don't know about evolution turns up a bunch of creationist sites and no actual answers to the question. If you are questioning the reasoning and logic behind the whole creationism thing then read this and decide which answer make sense between the science and the ideas from people that have no degrees in biology from a secular institution."

I'm giving it 4 stars because it's very informative and for the most part it's also enjoyable to read. Being a microbiologist and having previously read about ID I recognized many things in the text. However, I also understand that most people probably don't know so much about evolution or ID, and since ID is all about PR and propaganda it's easy to see that normal people don't immediately see it for what it is: a copy-paste of creationism with the word ""Designer"" replacing ""God"".This book is mainly aimed towards the American public, since it's in the US most of the Intelligent Design Movement exists. A big reason for this (also explained in the book) is the verdict of the Edwards v. Aguillard trial in 1987, where the US Supreme Court ruled that ""Teaching creationism in public schools is unconstitutional.."". This lead to the birth of the ""Intelligent Design Creationism"" and eventually a second court case, Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District in 2005, again with the court ruling that Intelligent Design is not science but merely Creationism pretending to be Science."
170,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1433053-james,4,"This was a very interesting primer on the evolution vs. intelligent design debate. It provides good talking points to arm yourself with if you plan to enter a debate with a creationist. It is interesting that the intelligent design movement is just a warmed over version of creationism that is trying to pose as scientific. Their main strategy so far has been to refute evolution. They do not have any research or evidence to back up any of their claims. The whole creationist mind set is based on ancient texts that can not be edited or updated when new evidence comes to light. Since they see the bible as the unerring word of God, they cannot incorporate the evidence of evolution because it renders their texts inaccurate. The creation myths of Genesis are understandable as a means for a Bronze Age civilization to explain their world. But given the tools and methods of science that we have now, there is no excuse to believe that the accounts of the worlds creation in the Bible are true. Get this book and read it. Then discuss with your creationist friends! "
171,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/828715-sonya-s,4,"Let's be fair: this is not a book for those already embroiled in the debates of creationism v. evolution. If you already have an in-depth knowledge of the theory of evolution, or have had extensive science classes, this book is not going to present any new material. However, I do recommend this book to people who are new to the debate, or to people who have just not thought about it that much.I'm a skeptic, and have read Mr. Shermer's various articles in Skeptic Magazine and through various skeptic websites, such as Skeptologists. Though I already knew most of the information presented, I found that Mr. Shermer was far less condescending than other skeptics I've read (I'm looking at you, Christopher Hitchens), and presented the material in an accessable, easy-to-understand matter. He carefully breaks down the sides of the argument and goes to show why evolution does, in fact, matter. What stuck with me the most, I think, was a question he posits somewhere towards the end of the book: why would anyone want to limit their deity to the physical realm in which we inhabit?"
172,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1264081-melydia,3,"I came away from this book with rather tepid feelings. It didn't feel like it flowed very well from point to point, and each point made felt glossed over, with a couple of bare sentences with a footnote. Shermer's survey of evolutionary biology was often unclear, but when he was in his element - that is, the psychology of belief and religiosity - the tone became smooth and easy to read. I especially liked his discussion of the evolution of morality and the Genesis revisit at the end. However, I found his discussion of logical fallacies fell flat, his responses to Intelligent Design arguments felt unsatisfying even to an evolutionist like myself, and he spent so much time referring to other books that I started to wonder what purpose there was in reading this one. I am not sure what the target audience of this book was, but I don't think I was part of it. Still, I do want to pick up some of Shermer's other works that fall closer to his own field of study. "
173,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51466379-morninglight-mama,3,"While I can't say with any shred of honesty that I understood the vast majority of this book, I can appreciate Shermer's emphasis on the so-called evolution vs. creationism or evolution vs. Intelligent Design debates. The simple bottom line is that evolution is science and both creationism and ID have no scientific basis, but are instead theological ideas and therefore do not belong in the same conversation of science. I know some people were turned off by his bouts of smugness or sarcasm throughout this book, but I could understand the frustration that could lead someone to communicate seemingly obvious arguments with a tinge of 'C'MON already!' I tried my best to get through the complex scientific jargon, but I mostly enjoyed the sections that discuss the more sociological perspectives of these 'conflicts' of ideas."
174,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/747149-jacob,2,"Honestly, I didn't finish this book. It offered no insight or argument that I already didn't know and understand. I'm also not sure how many people would find this book interesting. It's arguments against Intelligent Design from a former creationist. Creationists won't care what the arguments are and will avoid this on principle. Those with scientific interest and any basic knowledge should already understand this stuff. I guess there may be a market of undecided, open minded readers who aren't scientifically knowledgable, but are interested. In that circumstance, this would be a very good read. It's a slim book with clear, well-stated arguments, but I seriously doubt there are many people who would care or be interested who don't already know this stuff."
175,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/937966-mark,3,"Shermer has in the past presented ideas in an entertaining and inquisitive way. However, I think that that while this book certainly puts forward a clear argument why ID (Intelligent Design) fails, it does so with the caveat: there might still be something...Shermer is not an atheist, but an agnostic, and this book does not go the full route against Intelligent Design. That being said, the book is easy to read, and in the same style as Shermer's other excellent books such as Why People Believe Weird Things (a better book in my opinion). Intelligent Design fails absolutely as a scientific theory and Shermer makes that clear. However, the ""theory"" is still writhing in the dirt and Shermer walks away from the kill."
176,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61943-tamara,4,"Again, Shermer gets technical, but is still interesting. Not that I had to be convinced; evolution happened. One thing I like about Shermer is that he doesn't ridicule those who have religious faith, he just points out that the more literal sects (for instance, those who believe the Earth is only 10,000 years old) are just being stubbornly ignorant in ignoring irrefutable evidence that Earth is MUCH older than that. And he includes examples of scientists who have both strong religous faith and a belief in what science shows them to be true."
177,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/242253-sean-duffy,4,"There's nothing new here, but the text is clear and persuasive even though Shermer was preaching to the choir. I'm convinced that evolution happened and is happening (except for humans, for whom natural selection has been eliminated). ID's best arguments are explained and effectively dealt with. Still there persists the nagging question: why? As in, yes but, why? That question will remain unanswerable, and therein lies the only real argument for God. But this stuff about the Singularity is frightening. We should already be smashing the machines with our shoes."

To be honest, I already knew all of the scientific issues from reading debates online, so I didn't learn much from it, but I do think the book probably does a good job at convincing people who are already at least leaning towards pro-evolution but don't know all the details yet. For those that are leaning the other way, there's not enough there. I also had to raise an eyebrow at some of Shermer's reasons as to why conservatives and Christians should be pro-evolution.

Most of the book seems to be some history and background which is interesting, but not particularly focused. Personally, this book is weaker in its arguments than something like Faith vs Fact and Why Evolution is True by Jerry Coyne. It's a simple book but would not be my recommendation for a book that deals with evolution. The best thing he does in this book is demonstrate that Intelligent Design is a weakly disguised Creationism and that's it."
188,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2318453-paul,2,"The AuthorMichael Shermer is a former fundamentalist Christian turned skeptic. In fact, he started The Skeptics Society and is the editor in chief of Skeptic magazine. Shermer got his B.A. in Psychology from Pepperdine (though he began as a theology major). He went on to get his Master's in Experimental Psychology from CSU-Fullerton, and his Ph.D in the History of Science from Claremont. Shermer is the classic case of a Christian who turned his back on the faith when confronted with facts and then took up a career as an apologist against the faith (see also Bart Ehrman).SummaryThis book lays out the history of the development of the theory of evolution, and also a brief history of Shermer's journey from fundamentalist Christian faith to accepting the theory of evolution as true. Shermer attempts to give reasons why people disagree with evolution (and believe in religion). I imagine much of this material found its source in his other book Why People Believe Weird Things. Shermer researches the reasons behind the Intelligent Design movement and interviews its greatest supporters and determines that Intelligent Design is really just Creationism revisited. From this he determines that the argument to get ID into schools is an attempt to push the Christian religious views down the throats of children. He carefully notes that all of the major proponents of Intelligent Design are evangelical Christians except one. He also notes that no other piece of science has ever resorted to using political power to force its inclusion into the curriculum. He then goes through the 10 best arguments for Intelligent Design and attempts to disprove them. He shows that Intelligent Design is all about proving evolution wrong and offers no contributions of its own.Shermer draws on his theological background to show why Christians should believe in evolution. He also argues for a Non Overlapping Magisteria view of the relationship between religion and science (a la Steven Jay Gould). In other words, science can't contradict religion and vice versa because science is about the natural world and religion is about the supernatural world.Shermer ends by introducing the 10 greatest problems with the theory of evolution and shows where change is expected and more research is needed.My TakeAs one would expect from a man with a Ph.D. in the History of Science, Shermer does a good job of presenting the gradual accumulation of evidence for evolution over time. He gives us brief insights into the history of the debate between evolution and Christianity, and gives us some quotes from Darwin himself to show how he wrestled with his own ideas and their implications. Shermer also does a nice job of showing how Intelligent Design is *not* science, and is not helpful to scientists. Science is based on methodological naturalism, the assumption that everything has a natural cause. This limitation in scope is what makes science so good at what it does. A scientist can never throw his hands up and say ""It must be God"". There is no room for miracles. So scientists will search for the solution to a problem for generations! Scientists will proceed by trial and error forever to figure something out. That is why science has done such a good job of explaining how our universe works.Intelligent Design wants us to base our science on methodological supernaturalism, the assumption that some things have supernatural causes. But any scientist can see that this robs the scientific method of its greatest strength: its persistence. Now, any scientist working on any problem can just raise his hands and cry ""I can't explain it. It must be a miracle!""The right thing to do is not to include miracles into science, it is to show people the inherent limitations of science. I agree with Shermer on this point. Intelligent Design is not science.So, the first three quarters of this book, in my opinion, correctly show the evidence for evolution, the problems with ID, the history of the debate, and the underlying rationale of the ID crowd. All of this is worth reading. (Caveat: The justification of religion on evolutionary terms is weak almost to the point of ridiculousness)After that the book goes downhill fast, both in terms of quality of thought and quantity of evidence. (Exception: Chapter 10 on the problems in evolution is both honest and well done.) Shermer's attempt to show how religion and science are compatible is terrible. Shermer ""shows"" how religion evolved to make our evolved morals work better. This ""showing"" involves mostly suggestions of how it could have happened. Then he sallies forth with some philosophy showing how science and religion should relate to one another (the NOMA principle ... which isn't that bad, it's just poorly argued for). Shermer fails to impress there too. Finally, he adds an appendix to show how science can fill the void left by religion because religion is all about awe and science can inspire awe. So science is the new religion. Which is kind of what one would expect from a guy who has lived as a Christian, and felt like his faith betrayed him, and is looking for something else. The appendix should be required reading for anyone who does not believe that we should start educating our children on how science fits into the big picture of life. "
189,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61808093-alexander-rivas,4,"Being a Christian, I wanted to start to understand this whole evolution versus creation debate. I decided to read this book where I learned about Darwin, the setbacks both sides face in our society, and how a Christian can believe in evolution without going against his beliefs. I enjoyed this book and never felt upset or angered by its content."
190,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43784978-tracie-nicolai,3,Interesting. There are a couple of troublesome premises offered. Well done on the Darwin insights and educational impacts. 
191,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11566185-alan,2,"Needless to say, I disagree with the stanch naturalistic presuppositional tone in which this book was written. However, I picked this book knowing what to expect. Given that Michael Shermer is a militant agnostic, I don't expect him to write much differently. Honestly, I like Mike Shermer because he genuinely seems like a down-to-earth guy. Unfortunately, like the other mainstream atheist authors, he paints any worldview that doesn't coincide with mainstream Darwinism as an anchor that will inevitably slow the progress of science. This is discouraging to read because it is a complete misrepresentation of reality. Shermer ideologically assumes that intelligent design (ID) is a religious attack on science. This message is continuously communicated throughout the book. In his view, ID is a conspiracy against the ""scientific community"" (notice the presupposition that ID has nothing to add to the scientific dialogue) to demote science from a objective methodology of gathering information, testing hypothesis, etc... to throwing Bibles at children in schools. With this message being present throughout the book, it almost appears that regardless of what advocates of ID bring to the table, they will be dismissed before their ideas are even considered. It seems to be a philosophical commitment to rejecting anything with the possibility of a designer rather than being open to conclusions based on evidence, despite implications of a designer. Shermer attempts to take on some common ID arguments for the possibility of a designer. For example, the fine-tuning argument, as he admits, is the strongest argument for the existence of a designer. However, his treatment of it is horribly insufficient, especially when he is attempting to make 'the case against ID'. He treats to argument with sentiments like, 'the vast universe is empty space', 'the majority of the universe is inhospitable to life', and 'it is only in recent to time that the universe became finely tuned for life', just to name the highlights. He then resorted to saying that since the multiverse is a probable theory, of a potentially infinite amount of universes that exist, it's not surprising to see life existing under these types of improbable conditions. Clearly, it is irrelevant how occupied our universe is with life in order for it to be fine-tuned. Fine-tuning isn't contingent on the presence of life, life is contingent on the existence of fine-tuning. Without the presence of fine-tuning, the universe wouldn't be habitable. Since he has provided an insufficient refutation of fine-tuning, predictably, he enacted the multiverse theory to counteract the incomprehensibly improbable existence of fine-tuning of the universe for life. Despite what people like Shermer say about the speculative existence of a multiverse, there is no evidence for it and it plays a god-like figure in the ideologies of skeptics. Shermer attempted to treat the moral component of evolution near the end of the book. He declares that since objective morals exist, they are the result of biological evolution for the purposes of survivability. Under a Darwinian worldview, if true, they would have developed under the process of evolution and social conditioning. However, morals would not be objective. Meaning, there would not be a transcendent source for morality in which to judge moral actions. Essentially, no reference point in which to gauge moral good vs. bad. Shermer fails to address the ontological basis for morals under a Darwinian worldview. Maybe he completely overlooked it on the basis of this fact. A worldview is never appealing when you tell your adherents that there is no objective moral difference between Mother Theresa and Hitler.Overall, it was a good summary of the Darwinian point of view. Shermer is a good and qualified representative of this worldview. In my own opinion, it appeared that the ID position and overall ID motive on most matters was misrepresented to make the Darwinian position look better. Like I said, it's a mainstream book and you have to decipher the fact vs. the fiction."
192,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/369290-the-other-john,2,"The conflict between evolution and intelligent design is one of the warmer issues of the day. Since reading 
Darwin on Trial
, I've been in the design camp, but I've never been completely comfortable there. There's been too many times when a person whose opinions I respect blasts into intelligent design and I fumble about looking for an excuse for my position. And when some ardent supporter of my side starts laying on the propaganda, I likewise wince. So while I was back overseas, one thing I decided I should do upon my return to the land of the free and home of the public library was do some more digging on evolution. Specifically, I wanted to get some more info on how a supporter of evolution would respond to the main arguments of the design side. Well, this book was my first attempt at getting more info. Mr. Shermer was helpful in clearing away some of the confusion in my mind, but didn't draw me any closer to the evolution camp. The biggest favor that Mr. Shermer did was point out that the leading proponents of intelligent design are really creationists trying to sell their beliefs in a new package. I don't care for sales pitches regardless of who's doing the selling. That's the main reason why I would rate the book as waiting room material, despite the useful information it contains. Mr. Shermer has his own agenda to promote. As for the meat of the debate, I get the impression that, like the abortion conflict, the problem lies in the conflict of two different issues. By definition, science excludes the supernatural. If you can't observe it, measure it, study it, then you can't assume it exists. To bring divine revelation, namely, the Bible, into the science classroom, is a violation of the scientific method. I think what happened over the years in Western society is that many people have started to consider the scientific method the only source of authoritative knowledge. So while any good scientist will tell you that any scientific law or theory might be proven wrong some day, they will proceed to live as if the accepted laws and theories are the truth. Just as I live as if the Bible is the truth. So where does this leave me? Well, I wouldn't mind digging up some more info on evolution. I'm curious about the fossil record and just how many of the bones in the skeletons are real and how many have been imagined to fill in the gaps. But I also realize that I'm never going to have a simple, irrefutable argument as to why we should believe we're created. In the end, only the Creator can prove He exists."
193,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18061078-emma,1,"This book isn't about ""Why Darwin Matters"", it's an overview of what Intelligent Design is, how it's been used as a Trojan horse to try and sneak creationism into science, what its arguments are and why they're easy to debunk, etc. Shermer includes a lot of little factoids that are simplified to the point of being wrong, such as defining sexual selection as nothing more than female choice (although he does at least mention that other aspects of sexual selection exist in a later chapter) and saying things like ""ever since Darwin, [people have had an idea that was around long before Darwin]"". In a chapter focused mainly around why Christians shouldn't turn to intelligent design (because most of the ""Intelligent Design"" groups are run by evangelical Christians), he goes off on a random tangent about monogamy in which he projects his personal opinions onto nature with no evidence from biological research and demonizes men in the process (I know people throw around empty accusations of ""demonizing men"" whenever someone brings up sexism or toxic masculinity, but Shermer actually does it, along with infantilizing women and misinterpreting a study of college students in order to perpetuate the ""coy females"" stereotype that's been sneaking into biology for a while). Then, in the same chapter, he throws in a section about conservatives for some unknown reason (?) and starts rambling about Adam Smith and seems to argue for Social Darwinism, and makes up some nonsense about how evolution supposedly promotes some Malthusian, social Darwinist, extremely anti-Christian views (in the same chapter where he's trying to recruit Christians). There's no possible way this argument was written in good faith, because he's obviously done enough research to know that Darwinism isn't the same as Social Darwinism -- and even if it were, it's not something you should be promoting. Trying to get people to accept evolution by telling them that it will let them make up a pseudo-scientific argument in favor of whatever they already want to do, whether it's monogamy or laissez-faire economics or eugenics or anything else, is not an argument for evolution. Some parts of this book are pretty good as a basic overview of the topic (which is ""what's the Intelligent Design debate all about?"", not ""why does Darwin matter?""), but there are far better sources out there for this information, and I can't think of a reason to read this book when you could read almost anything else on the topic."
194,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3648143-rob,4,"When Michael Shermer surveyed people about their religious beliefs, asking them why they believed in God and why they thought other people believe in God, he found that people tend to invoke intellectual causes for their personal beliefs and assign emotional causes for the beliefs of others. While this trend may not be true for all people, a majority of people sampled exhibit this textbook attribution bias. I am certainly guilty of this, even to the point where I can’t help but question if my reading of this book is evidence of a further bias, the confirmation bias--a prejudice in which I form an opinion and seek out information that supports my already held beliefs thus reinforcing my supposed intellectualism on the topic. I can partly blame Mr. Shermer for my acute neuroticism. It was, after all, his book, The Believing Brain, that introduced me to most of the concepts that now affect my thinking. But, I don’t think this is a bad thing. Skepticism is a healthy attribute. Shermer’s book, Why Darwin Matters: The Case Against Intelligent Design does a much better job expounding on its subtitle than it’s primary title. It is not until the last page that Shermer reveals why Darwin matters (it’s because evolution matters, which matters because science matters, so there you go). The entire book is dedicated to dispelling the myths surrounding both sides of the creationism vs. evolution debate. Its longest chapter breaks down the ten best arguments for intelligent design (ID) and exposes them as unscientific religious propaganda. Shermer argues with tact, for the most part, avoiding the hyperbole one might expect in a book of this nature.The chapter covering ID in American public schools is particularly compelling for me because I have worked in a conservative school district where a dominant religion plays a huge role in what is taught in school. Shermer, a proud libertarian, would want a privatized school system where parents can choose to send their kids to whatever school they want, but he lays out his defense of evolution only science classrooms since most Americans are publicly schooled. He summarizes several court cases, and builds his defense primarily on the legal justification for evolution in the classroom. He explains that creationism can not be understood as science when we understand what science is."
195,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3038974-steve-van-slyke,4,"For those who have not read much about evolution or the debate between creationists and science this is a good place to start. On the other hand for those that have, it may seem a bit thin in some areas but even so he offers many new takes on the relation between the domains of science and religion. He also mentions and quotes several other authorities whose works go into evolution more deeply such as Dawkins, Margulis, Mayr, Gould, Fortey, Kenneth Miller, and others. He also comments on the writings of the main proponents of ID, such as Behe, Dembski, Meyer and Wells.At one point Shermer states that he was advised against debating proponents of Intelligent Design because it only served to give them credibility. As I read more of his analysis of the arguments on both sides I began to agree with his advisers. Nevertheless, Shermer makes the case that when the stakes become more than just winning a debate, when it comes down to whether science, or religion thinly disguised as science, will be taught in public schools, then someone has to step forward and shine the light of reason on the discussion.Shermer points out that is a relatively small minority of religious groups, primarily the 70% of evangelical Christians who do not accept evolution. The vast majority of mainstream Protestants and Catholics do accept evolution.He goes on to make the case that there are three possible approaches to the relationship between religion and science: 1) to make war on each other, 2) to combine, or 3) to co-exist in separate realms. The latter he says is the only rational option. “Believers can have both religion and science as long as...” they don't try to force the two together. “God is beyond the dominion of science, and science is outside the realm of God.”"
196,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1542839-mike,4,"This was quite a good defense of the neo-Darwinian synthesis. I think I tend to hold Michael Shermer in lower intellectual regard than, for example, Richard Dawkins, Daniel Dennett, or Stephen Gould. But this book is really an excellent, scholarly work. Like the best output by Carl Sagan, Shermer regards people's faith with seriousness and respect, at the same time using logic and evidence to build his own case. The book starts with a great, pocket description of what evolution is, and what natural selection is, followed by a list of the reasons that people use to reject it. He ranks these reasons by their intellectual rigor, then refutes them using science and the data that have been found since the 1800s. He deals with social Darwinism, the non-effect that Darwinism has on ethics and morals, it's non-attachment to nihilism. He then talks about debate tactics that intelligent design proponents use in debates against him, ranks them again, and points out the fallacy in each. He presents a case of why Christians should accept evolution, using the language of theology and even showing the influence of Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations on Darwin's work. The final chapter is a fascinating look at the actual modern controversies in evolution science, as opposed to those trumped up by ID supporters. Again, all in all, an excellent, concise use of philosophy, genetics, theology, biology, and history against the creeping ID movement. "
197,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6076331-ergun-coruh,4,"The publisher of Skeptic magazine was once an enthusiastic Evangelical Christian, but his ardent pursuit of a scientific education induced reconsideration. Now he staunchly advocates discriminating religion from science and in this book concisely defends evolutionary theory from the almost exclusively -Evangelical--Christian-backed concept of intelligent design (ID), aka creationism, aka creation science--the name changes whenever a suit over having public schools teach the idea as science gets shot down by a high U.S. court (the ID movement always appeals mere state-court decisions). Shermer debates ID often, and he expertly marshals point-by-point explanations of why evolution is worthwhile science, why ID isn't science at all, why ID criticisms of evolution are irrelevant, why science cannot invalidate religion, and why Christians and conservatives ought to accept evolution. His orderly presentation makes the book something of a reference manual on evolution, and only the historically minded will smile at his citation of congruence between evolution and Adam Smith as reason for conservatives to embrace evolution, for Smith's capitalism is a branch of classical liberalism.

But this was a good read as it breaks down the most common arguments against evolution and shows why biologists and naturalists reject and laugh at them. It's a good guide on how to argue with a creationist but things have changed since then and creationists are creating new arguments to justify their beliefs so this is a tip of the iceberg since creationists have some more arguments that this book doesn't cover, might need to do a little bit of research there. Along with covering all of the arguments and what your response should be to each, it also explains the different forms of creationism and intelligent design. Shermer might want to re-release it to provide updated information in the section explaining what we really don't know about evolution since a Google search into what we still don't know about evolution turns up a bunch of creationist sites and no actual answers to the question. If you are questioning the reasoning and logic behind the whole creationism thing then read this and decide which answer make sense between the science and the ideas from people that have no degrees in biology from a secular institution."

I'm giving it 4 stars because it's very informative and for the most part it's also enjoyable to read. Being a microbiologist and having previously read about ID I recognized many things in the text. However, I also understand that most people probably don't know so much about evolution or ID, and since ID is all about PR and propaganda it's easy to see that normal people don't immediately see it for what it is: a copy-paste of creationism with the word ""Designer"" replacing ""God"".This book is mainly aimed towards the American public, since it's in the US most of the Intelligent Design Movement exists. A big reason for this (also explained in the book) is the verdict of the Edwards v. Aguillard trial in 1987, where the US Supreme Court ruled that ""Teaching creationism in public schools is unconstitutional.."". This lead to the birth of the ""Intelligent Design Creationism"" and eventually a second court case, Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District in 2005, again with the court ruling that Intelligent Design is not science but merely Creationism pretending to be Science."
200,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1433053-james,4,"This was a very interesting primer on the evolution vs. intelligent design debate. It provides good talking points to arm yourself with if you plan to enter a debate with a creationist. It is interesting that the intelligent design movement is just a warmed over version of creationism that is trying to pose as scientific. Their main strategy so far has been to refute evolution. They do not have any research or evidence to back up any of their claims. The whole creationist mind set is based on ancient texts that can not be edited or updated when new evidence comes to light. Since they see the bible as the unerring word of God, they cannot incorporate the evidence of evolution because it renders their texts inaccurate. The creation myths of Genesis are understandable as a means for a Bronze Age civilization to explain their world. But given the tools and methods of science that we have now, there is no excuse to believe that the accounts of the worlds creation in the Bible are true. Get this book and read it. Then discuss with your creationist friends! "
201,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/828715-sonya-s,4,"Let's be fair: this is not a book for those already embroiled in the debates of creationism v. evolution. If you already have an in-depth knowledge of the theory of evolution, or have had extensive science classes, this book is not going to present any new material. However, I do recommend this book to people who are new to the debate, or to people who have just not thought about it that much.I'm a skeptic, and have read Mr. Shermer's various articles in Skeptic Magazine and through various skeptic websites, such as Skeptologists. Though I already knew most of the information presented, I found that Mr. Shermer was far less condescending than other skeptics I've read (I'm looking at you, Christopher Hitchens), and presented the material in an accessable, easy-to-understand matter. He carefully breaks down the sides of the argument and goes to show why evolution does, in fact, matter. What stuck with me the most, I think, was a question he posits somewhere towards the end of the book: why would anyone want to limit their deity to the physical realm in which we inhabit?"
202,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1264081-melydia,3,"I came away from this book with rather tepid feelings. It didn't feel like it flowed very well from point to point, and each point made felt glossed over, with a couple of bare sentences with a footnote. Shermer's survey of evolutionary biology was often unclear, but when he was in his element - that is, the psychology of belief and religiosity - the tone became smooth and easy to read. I especially liked his discussion of the evolution of morality and the Genesis revisit at the end. However, I found his discussion of logical fallacies fell flat, his responses to Intelligent Design arguments felt unsatisfying even to an evolutionist like myself, and he spent so much time referring to other books that I started to wonder what purpose there was in reading this one. I am not sure what the target audience of this book was, but I don't think I was part of it. Still, I do want to pick up some of Shermer's other works that fall closer to his own field of study. "
203,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51466379-morninglight-mama,3,"While I can't say with any shred of honesty that I understood the vast majority of this book, I can appreciate Shermer's emphasis on the so-called evolution vs. creationism or evolution vs. Intelligent Design debates. The simple bottom line is that evolution is science and both creationism and ID have no scientific basis, but are instead theological ideas and therefore do not belong in the same conversation of science. I know some people were turned off by his bouts of smugness or sarcasm throughout this book, but I could understand the frustration that could lead someone to communicate seemingly obvious arguments with a tinge of 'C'MON already!' I tried my best to get through the complex scientific jargon, but I mostly enjoyed the sections that discuss the more sociological perspectives of these 'conflicts' of ideas."
204,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/747149-jacob,2,"Honestly, I didn't finish this book. It offered no insight or argument that I already didn't know and understand. I'm also not sure how many people would find this book interesting. It's arguments against Intelligent Design from a former creationist. Creationists won't care what the arguments are and will avoid this on principle. Those with scientific interest and any basic knowledge should already understand this stuff. I guess there may be a market of undecided, open minded readers who aren't scientifically knowledgable, but are interested. In that circumstance, this would be a very good read. It's a slim book with clear, well-stated arguments, but I seriously doubt there are many people who would care or be interested who don't already know this stuff."
205,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/937966-mark,3,"Shermer has in the past presented ideas in an entertaining and inquisitive way. However, I think that that while this book certainly puts forward a clear argument why ID (Intelligent Design) fails, it does so with the caveat: there might still be something...Shermer is not an atheist, but an agnostic, and this book does not go the full route against Intelligent Design. That being said, the book is easy to read, and in the same style as Shermer's other excellent books such as Why People Believe Weird Things (a better book in my opinion). Intelligent Design fails absolutely as a scientific theory and Shermer makes that clear. However, the ""theory"" is still writhing in the dirt and Shermer walks away from the kill."
206,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61943-tamara,4,"Again, Shermer gets technical, but is still interesting. Not that I had to be convinced; evolution happened. One thing I like about Shermer is that he doesn't ridicule those who have religious faith, he just points out that the more literal sects (for instance, those who believe the Earth is only 10,000 years old) are just being stubbornly ignorant in ignoring irrefutable evidence that Earth is MUCH older than that. And he includes examples of scientists who have both strong religous faith and a belief in what science shows them to be true."
207,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/242253-sean-duffy,4,"There's nothing new here, but the text is clear and persuasive even though Shermer was preaching to the choir. I'm convinced that evolution happened and is happening (except for humans, for whom natural selection has been eliminated). ID's best arguments are explained and effectively dealt with. Still there persists the nagging question: why? As in, yes but, why? That question will remain unanswerable, and therein lies the only real argument for God. But this stuff about the Singularity is frightening. We should already be smashing the machines with our shoes."

To be honest, I already knew all of the scientific issues from reading debates online, so I didn't learn much from it, but I do think the book probably does a good job at convincing people who are already at least leaning towards pro-evolution but don't know all the details yet. For those that are leaning the other way, there's not enough there. I also had to raise an eyebrow at some of Shermer's reasons as to why conservatives and Christians should be pro-evolution.

Most of the book seems to be some history and background which is interesting, but not particularly focused. Personally, this book is weaker in its arguments than something like Faith vs Fact and Why Evolution is True by Jerry Coyne. It's a simple book but would not be my recommendation for a book that deals with evolution. The best thing he does in this book is demonstrate that Intelligent Design is a weakly disguised Creationism and that's it."
218,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2318453-paul,2,"The AuthorMichael Shermer is a former fundamentalist Christian turned skeptic. In fact, he started The Skeptics Society and is the editor in chief of Skeptic magazine. Shermer got his B.A. in Psychology from Pepperdine (though he began as a theology major). He went on to get his Master's in Experimental Psychology from CSU-Fullerton, and his Ph.D in the History of Science from Claremont. Shermer is the classic case of a Christian who turned his back on the faith when confronted with facts and then took up a career as an apologist against the faith (see also Bart Ehrman).SummaryThis book lays out the history of the development of the theory of evolution, and also a brief history of Shermer's journey from fundamentalist Christian faith to accepting the theory of evolution as true. Shermer attempts to give reasons why people disagree with evolution (and believe in religion). I imagine much of this material found its source in his other book Why People Believe Weird Things. Shermer researches the reasons behind the Intelligent Design movement and interviews its greatest supporters and determines that Intelligent Design is really just Creationism revisited. From this he determines that the argument to get ID into schools is an attempt to push the Christian religious views down the throats of children. He carefully notes that all of the major proponents of Intelligent Design are evangelical Christians except one. He also notes that no other piece of science has ever resorted to using political power to force its inclusion into the curriculum. He then goes through the 10 best arguments for Intelligent Design and attempts to disprove them. He shows that Intelligent Design is all about proving evolution wrong and offers no contributions of its own.Shermer draws on his theological background to show why Christians should believe in evolution. He also argues for a Non Overlapping Magisteria view of the relationship between religion and science (a la Steven Jay Gould). In other words, science can't contradict religion and vice versa because science is about the natural world and religion is about the supernatural world.Shermer ends by introducing the 10 greatest problems with the theory of evolution and shows where change is expected and more research is needed.My TakeAs one would expect from a man with a Ph.D. in the History of Science, Shermer does a good job of presenting the gradual accumulation of evidence for evolution over time. He gives us brief insights into the history of the debate between evolution and Christianity, and gives us some quotes from Darwin himself to show how he wrestled with his own ideas and their implications. Shermer also does a nice job of showing how Intelligent Design is *not* science, and is not helpful to scientists. Science is based on methodological naturalism, the assumption that everything has a natural cause. This limitation in scope is what makes science so good at what it does. A scientist can never throw his hands up and say ""It must be God"". There is no room for miracles. So scientists will search for the solution to a problem for generations! Scientists will proceed by trial and error forever to figure something out. That is why science has done such a good job of explaining how our universe works.Intelligent Design wants us to base our science on methodological supernaturalism, the assumption that some things have supernatural causes. But any scientist can see that this robs the scientific method of its greatest strength: its persistence. Now, any scientist working on any problem can just raise his hands and cry ""I can't explain it. It must be a miracle!""The right thing to do is not to include miracles into science, it is to show people the inherent limitations of science. I agree with Shermer on this point. Intelligent Design is not science.So, the first three quarters of this book, in my opinion, correctly show the evidence for evolution, the problems with ID, the history of the debate, and the underlying rationale of the ID crowd. All of this is worth reading. (Caveat: The justification of religion on evolutionary terms is weak almost to the point of ridiculousness)After that the book goes downhill fast, both in terms of quality of thought and quantity of evidence. (Exception: Chapter 10 on the problems in evolution is both honest and well done.) Shermer's attempt to show how religion and science are compatible is terrible. Shermer ""shows"" how religion evolved to make our evolved morals work better. This ""showing"" involves mostly suggestions of how it could have happened. Then he sallies forth with some philosophy showing how science and religion should relate to one another (the NOMA principle ... which isn't that bad, it's just poorly argued for). Shermer fails to impress there too. Finally, he adds an appendix to show how science can fill the void left by religion because religion is all about awe and science can inspire awe. So science is the new religion. Which is kind of what one would expect from a guy who has lived as a Christian, and felt like his faith betrayed him, and is looking for something else. The appendix should be required reading for anyone who does not believe that we should start educating our children on how science fits into the big picture of life. "
219,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61808093-alexander-rivas,4,"Being a Christian, I wanted to start to understand this whole evolution versus creation debate. I decided to read this book where I learned about Darwin, the setbacks both sides face in our society, and how a Christian can believe in evolution without going against his beliefs. I enjoyed this book and never felt upset or angered by its content."
220,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43784978-tracie-nicolai,3,Interesting. There are a couple of troublesome premises offered. Well done on the Darwin insights and educational impacts. 
221,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11566185-alan,2,"Needless to say, I disagree with the stanch naturalistic presuppositional tone in which this book was written. However, I picked this book knowing what to expect. Given that Michael Shermer is a militant agnostic, I don't expect him to write much differently. Honestly, I like Mike Shermer because he genuinely seems like a down-to-earth guy. Unfortunately, like the other mainstream atheist authors, he paints any worldview that doesn't coincide with mainstream Darwinism as an anchor that will inevitably slow the progress of science. This is discouraging to read because it is a complete misrepresentation of reality. Shermer ideologically assumes that intelligent design (ID) is a religious attack on science. This message is continuously communicated throughout the book. In his view, ID is a conspiracy against the ""scientific community"" (notice the presupposition that ID has nothing to add to the scientific dialogue) to demote science from a objective methodology of gathering information, testing hypothesis, etc... to throwing Bibles at children in schools. With this message being present throughout the book, it almost appears that regardless of what advocates of ID bring to the table, they will be dismissed before their ideas are even considered. It seems to be a philosophical commitment to rejecting anything with the possibility of a designer rather than being open to conclusions based on evidence, despite implications of a designer. Shermer attempts to take on some common ID arguments for the possibility of a designer. For example, the fine-tuning argument, as he admits, is the strongest argument for the existence of a designer. However, his treatment of it is horribly insufficient, especially when he is attempting to make 'the case against ID'. He treats to argument with sentiments like, 'the vast universe is empty space', 'the majority of the universe is inhospitable to life', and 'it is only in recent to time that the universe became finely tuned for life', just to name the highlights. He then resorted to saying that since the multiverse is a probable theory, of a potentially infinite amount of universes that exist, it's not surprising to see life existing under these types of improbable conditions. Clearly, it is irrelevant how occupied our universe is with life in order for it to be fine-tuned. Fine-tuning isn't contingent on the presence of life, life is contingent on the existence of fine-tuning. Without the presence of fine-tuning, the universe wouldn't be habitable. Since he has provided an insufficient refutation of fine-tuning, predictably, he enacted the multiverse theory to counteract the incomprehensibly improbable existence of fine-tuning of the universe for life. Despite what people like Shermer say about the speculative existence of a multiverse, there is no evidence for it and it plays a god-like figure in the ideologies of skeptics. Shermer attempted to treat the moral component of evolution near the end of the book. He declares that since objective morals exist, they are the result of biological evolution for the purposes of survivability. Under a Darwinian worldview, if true, they would have developed under the process of evolution and social conditioning. However, morals would not be objective. Meaning, there would not be a transcendent source for morality in which to judge moral actions. Essentially, no reference point in which to gauge moral good vs. bad. Shermer fails to address the ontological basis for morals under a Darwinian worldview. Maybe he completely overlooked it on the basis of this fact. A worldview is never appealing when you tell your adherents that there is no objective moral difference between Mother Theresa and Hitler.Overall, it was a good summary of the Darwinian point of view. Shermer is a good and qualified representative of this worldview. In my own opinion, it appeared that the ID position and overall ID motive on most matters was misrepresented to make the Darwinian position look better. Like I said, it's a mainstream book and you have to decipher the fact vs. the fiction."
222,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/369290-the-other-john,2,"The conflict between evolution and intelligent design is one of the warmer issues of the day. Since reading 
Darwin on Trial
, I've been in the design camp, but I've never been completely comfortable there. There's been too many times when a person whose opinions I respect blasts into intelligent design and I fumble about looking for an excuse for my position. And when some ardent supporter of my side starts laying on the propaganda, I likewise wince. So while I was back overseas, one thing I decided I should do upon my return to the land of the free and home of the public library was do some more digging on evolution. Specifically, I wanted to get some more info on how a supporter of evolution would respond to the main arguments of the design side. Well, this book was my first attempt at getting more info. Mr. Shermer was helpful in clearing away some of the confusion in my mind, but didn't draw me any closer to the evolution camp. The biggest favor that Mr. Shermer did was point out that the leading proponents of intelligent design are really creationists trying to sell their beliefs in a new package. I don't care for sales pitches regardless of who's doing the selling. That's the main reason why I would rate the book as waiting room material, despite the useful information it contains. Mr. Shermer has his own agenda to promote. As for the meat of the debate, I get the impression that, like the abortion conflict, the problem lies in the conflict of two different issues. By definition, science excludes the supernatural. If you can't observe it, measure it, study it, then you can't assume it exists. To bring divine revelation, namely, the Bible, into the science classroom, is a violation of the scientific method. I think what happened over the years in Western society is that many people have started to consider the scientific method the only source of authoritative knowledge. So while any good scientist will tell you that any scientific law or theory might be proven wrong some day, they will proceed to live as if the accepted laws and theories are the truth. Just as I live as if the Bible is the truth. So where does this leave me? Well, I wouldn't mind digging up some more info on evolution. I'm curious about the fossil record and just how many of the bones in the skeletons are real and how many have been imagined to fill in the gaps. But I also realize that I'm never going to have a simple, irrefutable argument as to why we should believe we're created. In the end, only the Creator can prove He exists."
223,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18061078-emma,1,"This book isn't about ""Why Darwin Matters"", it's an overview of what Intelligent Design is, how it's been used as a Trojan horse to try and sneak creationism into science, what its arguments are and why they're easy to debunk, etc. Shermer includes a lot of little factoids that are simplified to the point of being wrong, such as defining sexual selection as nothing more than female choice (although he does at least mention that other aspects of sexual selection exist in a later chapter) and saying things like ""ever since Darwin, [people have had an idea that was around long before Darwin]"". In a chapter focused mainly around why Christians shouldn't turn to intelligent design (because most of the ""Intelligent Design"" groups are run by evangelical Christians), he goes off on a random tangent about monogamy in which he projects his personal opinions onto nature with no evidence from biological research and demonizes men in the process (I know people throw around empty accusations of ""demonizing men"" whenever someone brings up sexism or toxic masculinity, but Shermer actually does it, along with infantilizing women and misinterpreting a study of college students in order to perpetuate the ""coy females"" stereotype that's been sneaking into biology for a while). Then, in the same chapter, he throws in a section about conservatives for some unknown reason (?) and starts rambling about Adam Smith and seems to argue for Social Darwinism, and makes up some nonsense about how evolution supposedly promotes some Malthusian, social Darwinist, extremely anti-Christian views (in the same chapter where he's trying to recruit Christians). There's no possible way this argument was written in good faith, because he's obviously done enough research to know that Darwinism isn't the same as Social Darwinism -- and even if it were, it's not something you should be promoting. Trying to get people to accept evolution by telling them that it will let them make up a pseudo-scientific argument in favor of whatever they already want to do, whether it's monogamy or laissez-faire economics or eugenics or anything else, is not an argument for evolution. Some parts of this book are pretty good as a basic overview of the topic (which is ""what's the Intelligent Design debate all about?"", not ""why does Darwin matter?""), but there are far better sources out there for this information, and I can't think of a reason to read this book when you could read almost anything else on the topic."
224,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3648143-rob,4,"When Michael Shermer surveyed people about their religious beliefs, asking them why they believed in God and why they thought other people believe in God, he found that people tend to invoke intellectual causes for their personal beliefs and assign emotional causes for the beliefs of others. While this trend may not be true for all people, a majority of people sampled exhibit this textbook attribution bias. I am certainly guilty of this, even to the point where I can’t help but question if my reading of this book is evidence of a further bias, the confirmation bias--a prejudice in which I form an opinion and seek out information that supports my already held beliefs thus reinforcing my supposed intellectualism on the topic. I can partly blame Mr. Shermer for my acute neuroticism. It was, after all, his book, The Believing Brain, that introduced me to most of the concepts that now affect my thinking. But, I don’t think this is a bad thing. Skepticism is a healthy attribute. Shermer’s book, Why Darwin Matters: The Case Against Intelligent Design does a much better job expounding on its subtitle than it’s primary title. It is not until the last page that Shermer reveals why Darwin matters (it’s because evolution matters, which matters because science matters, so there you go). The entire book is dedicated to dispelling the myths surrounding both sides of the creationism vs. evolution debate. Its longest chapter breaks down the ten best arguments for intelligent design (ID) and exposes them as unscientific religious propaganda. Shermer argues with tact, for the most part, avoiding the hyperbole one might expect in a book of this nature.The chapter covering ID in American public schools is particularly compelling for me because I have worked in a conservative school district where a dominant religion plays a huge role in what is taught in school. Shermer, a proud libertarian, would want a privatized school system where parents can choose to send their kids to whatever school they want, but he lays out his defense of evolution only science classrooms since most Americans are publicly schooled. He summarizes several court cases, and builds his defense primarily on the legal justification for evolution in the classroom. He explains that creationism can not be understood as science when we understand what science is."
225,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3038974-steve-van-slyke,4,"For those who have not read much about evolution or the debate between creationists and science this is a good place to start. On the other hand for those that have, it may seem a bit thin in some areas but even so he offers many new takes on the relation between the domains of science and religion. He also mentions and quotes several other authorities whose works go into evolution more deeply such as Dawkins, Margulis, Mayr, Gould, Fortey, Kenneth Miller, and others. He also comments on the writings of the main proponents of ID, such as Behe, Dembski, Meyer and Wells.At one point Shermer states that he was advised against debating proponents of Intelligent Design because it only served to give them credibility. As I read more of his analysis of the arguments on both sides I began to agree with his advisers. Nevertheless, Shermer makes the case that when the stakes become more than just winning a debate, when it comes down to whether science, or religion thinly disguised as science, will be taught in public schools, then someone has to step forward and shine the light of reason on the discussion.Shermer points out that is a relatively small minority of religious groups, primarily the 70% of evangelical Christians who do not accept evolution. The vast majority of mainstream Protestants and Catholics do accept evolution.He goes on to make the case that there are three possible approaches to the relationship between religion and science: 1) to make war on each other, 2) to combine, or 3) to co-exist in separate realms. The latter he says is the only rational option. “Believers can have both religion and science as long as...” they don't try to force the two together. “God is beyond the dominion of science, and science is outside the realm of God.”"
226,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1542839-mike,4,"This was quite a good defense of the neo-Darwinian synthesis. I think I tend to hold Michael Shermer in lower intellectual regard than, for example, Richard Dawkins, Daniel Dennett, or Stephen Gould. But this book is really an excellent, scholarly work. Like the best output by Carl Sagan, Shermer regards people's faith with seriousness and respect, at the same time using logic and evidence to build his own case. The book starts with a great, pocket description of what evolution is, and what natural selection is, followed by a list of the reasons that people use to reject it. He ranks these reasons by their intellectual rigor, then refutes them using science and the data that have been found since the 1800s. He deals with social Darwinism, the non-effect that Darwinism has on ethics and morals, it's non-attachment to nihilism. He then talks about debate tactics that intelligent design proponents use in debates against him, ranks them again, and points out the fallacy in each. He presents a case of why Christians should accept evolution, using the language of theology and even showing the influence of Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations on Darwin's work. The final chapter is a fascinating look at the actual modern controversies in evolution science, as opposed to those trumped up by ID supporters. Again, all in all, an excellent, concise use of philosophy, genetics, theology, biology, and history against the creeping ID movement. "
227,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6076331-ergun-coruh,4,"The publisher of Skeptic magazine was once an enthusiastic Evangelical Christian, but his ardent pursuit of a scientific education induced reconsideration. Now he staunchly advocates discriminating religion from science and in this book concisely defends evolutionary theory from the almost exclusively -Evangelical--Christian-backed concept of intelligent design (ID), aka creationism, aka creation science--the name changes whenever a suit over having public schools teach the idea as science gets shot down by a high U.S. court (the ID movement always appeals mere state-court decisions). Shermer debates ID often, and he expertly marshals point-by-point explanations of why evolution is worthwhile science, why ID isn't science at all, why ID criticisms of evolution are irrelevant, why science cannot invalidate religion, and why Christians and conservatives ought to accept evolution. His orderly presentation makes the book something of a reference manual on evolution, and only the historically minded will smile at his citation of congruence between evolution and Adam Smith as reason for conservatives to embrace evolution, for Smith's capitalism is a branch of classical liberalism.

But this was a good read as it breaks down the most common arguments against evolution and shows why biologists and naturalists reject and laugh at them. It's a good guide on how to argue with a creationist but things have changed since then and creationists are creating new arguments to justify their beliefs so this is a tip of the iceberg since creationists have some more arguments that this book doesn't cover, might need to do a little bit of research there. Along with covering all of the arguments and what your response should be to each, it also explains the different forms of creationism and intelligent design. Shermer might want to re-release it to provide updated information in the section explaining what we really don't know about evolution since a Google search into what we still don't know about evolution turns up a bunch of creationist sites and no actual answers to the question. If you are questioning the reasoning and logic behind the whole creationism thing then read this and decide which answer make sense between the science and the ideas from people that have no degrees in biology from a secular institution."

I'm giving it 4 stars because it's very informative and for the most part it's also enjoyable to read. Being a microbiologist and having previously read about ID I recognized many things in the text. However, I also understand that most people probably don't know so much about evolution or ID, and since ID is all about PR and propaganda it's easy to see that normal people don't immediately see it for what it is: a copy-paste of creationism with the word ""Designer"" replacing ""God"".This book is mainly aimed towards the American public, since it's in the US most of the Intelligent Design Movement exists. A big reason for this (also explained in the book) is the verdict of the Edwards v. Aguillard trial in 1987, where the US Supreme Court ruled that ""Teaching creationism in public schools is unconstitutional.."". This lead to the birth of the ""Intelligent Design Creationism"" and eventually a second court case, Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District in 2005, again with the court ruling that Intelligent Design is not science but merely Creationism pretending to be Science."
230,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1433053-james,4,"This was a very interesting primer on the evolution vs. intelligent design debate. It provides good talking points to arm yourself with if you plan to enter a debate with a creationist. It is interesting that the intelligent design movement is just a warmed over version of creationism that is trying to pose as scientific. Their main strategy so far has been to refute evolution. They do not have any research or evidence to back up any of their claims. The whole creationist mind set is based on ancient texts that can not be edited or updated when new evidence comes to light. Since they see the bible as the unerring word of God, they cannot incorporate the evidence of evolution because it renders their texts inaccurate. The creation myths of Genesis are understandable as a means for a Bronze Age civilization to explain their world. But given the tools and methods of science that we have now, there is no excuse to believe that the accounts of the worlds creation in the Bible are true. Get this book and read it. Then discuss with your creationist friends! "
231,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/828715-sonya-s,4,"Let's be fair: this is not a book for those already embroiled in the debates of creationism v. evolution. If you already have an in-depth knowledge of the theory of evolution, or have had extensive science classes, this book is not going to present any new material. However, I do recommend this book to people who are new to the debate, or to people who have just not thought about it that much.I'm a skeptic, and have read Mr. Shermer's various articles in Skeptic Magazine and through various skeptic websites, such as Skeptologists. Though I already knew most of the information presented, I found that Mr. Shermer was far less condescending than other skeptics I've read (I'm looking at you, Christopher Hitchens), and presented the material in an accessable, easy-to-understand matter. He carefully breaks down the sides of the argument and goes to show why evolution does, in fact, matter. What stuck with me the most, I think, was a question he posits somewhere towards the end of the book: why would anyone want to limit their deity to the physical realm in which we inhabit?"
232,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1264081-melydia,3,"I came away from this book with rather tepid feelings. It didn't feel like it flowed very well from point to point, and each point made felt glossed over, with a couple of bare sentences with a footnote. Shermer's survey of evolutionary biology was often unclear, but when he was in his element - that is, the psychology of belief and religiosity - the tone became smooth and easy to read. I especially liked his discussion of the evolution of morality and the Genesis revisit at the end. However, I found his discussion of logical fallacies fell flat, his responses to Intelligent Design arguments felt unsatisfying even to an evolutionist like myself, and he spent so much time referring to other books that I started to wonder what purpose there was in reading this one. I am not sure what the target audience of this book was, but I don't think I was part of it. Still, I do want to pick up some of Shermer's other works that fall closer to his own field of study. "
233,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51466379-morninglight-mama,3,"While I can't say with any shred of honesty that I understood the vast majority of this book, I can appreciate Shermer's emphasis on the so-called evolution vs. creationism or evolution vs. Intelligent Design debates. The simple bottom line is that evolution is science and both creationism and ID have no scientific basis, but are instead theological ideas and therefore do not belong in the same conversation of science. I know some people were turned off by his bouts of smugness or sarcasm throughout this book, but I could understand the frustration that could lead someone to communicate seemingly obvious arguments with a tinge of 'C'MON already!' I tried my best to get through the complex scientific jargon, but I mostly enjoyed the sections that discuss the more sociological perspectives of these 'conflicts' of ideas."
234,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/747149-jacob,2,"Honestly, I didn't finish this book. It offered no insight or argument that I already didn't know and understand. I'm also not sure how many people would find this book interesting. It's arguments against Intelligent Design from a former creationist. Creationists won't care what the arguments are and will avoid this on principle. Those with scientific interest and any basic knowledge should already understand this stuff. I guess there may be a market of undecided, open minded readers who aren't scientifically knowledgable, but are interested. In that circumstance, this would be a very good read. It's a slim book with clear, well-stated arguments, but I seriously doubt there are many people who would care or be interested who don't already know this stuff."
235,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/937966-mark,3,"Shermer has in the past presented ideas in an entertaining and inquisitive way. However, I think that that while this book certainly puts forward a clear argument why ID (Intelligent Design) fails, it does so with the caveat: there might still be something...Shermer is not an atheist, but an agnostic, and this book does not go the full route against Intelligent Design. That being said, the book is easy to read, and in the same style as Shermer's other excellent books such as Why People Believe Weird Things (a better book in my opinion). Intelligent Design fails absolutely as a scientific theory and Shermer makes that clear. However, the ""theory"" is still writhing in the dirt and Shermer walks away from the kill."
236,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61943-tamara,4,"Again, Shermer gets technical, but is still interesting. Not that I had to be convinced; evolution happened. One thing I like about Shermer is that he doesn't ridicule those who have religious faith, he just points out that the more literal sects (for instance, those who believe the Earth is only 10,000 years old) are just being stubbornly ignorant in ignoring irrefutable evidence that Earth is MUCH older than that. And he includes examples of scientists who have both strong religous faith and a belief in what science shows them to be true."
237,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/242253-sean-duffy,4,"There's nothing new here, but the text is clear and persuasive even though Shermer was preaching to the choir. I'm convinced that evolution happened and is happening (except for humans, for whom natural selection has been eliminated). ID's best arguments are explained and effectively dealt with. Still there persists the nagging question: why? As in, yes but, why? That question will remain unanswerable, and therein lies the only real argument for God. But this stuff about the Singularity is frightening. We should already be smashing the machines with our shoes."

For those that are leaning the other way, there's not enough there. I also had to raise an eyebrow at some of Shermer's reasons as to why conservatives and Christians should be pro-evolution.

Most of the book seems to be some history and background which is interesting, but not particularly focused. Personally, this book is weaker in its arguments than something like Faith vs Fact and Why Evolution is True by Jerry Coyne. It's a simple book but would not be my recommendation for a book that deals with evolution. The best thing he does in this book is demonstrate that Intelligent Design is a weakly disguised Creationism and that's it."
248,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2318453-paul,2,"The AuthorMichael Shermer is a former fundamentalist Christian turned skeptic. In fact, he started The Skeptics Society and is the editor in chief of Skeptic magazine. Shermer got his B.A. in Psychology from Pepperdine (though he began as a theology major). He went on to get his Master's in Experimental Psychology from CSU-Fullerton, and his Ph.D in the History of Science from Claremont. Shermer is the classic case of a Christian who turned his back on the faith when confronted with facts and then took up a career as an apologist against the faith (see also Bart Ehrman).SummaryThis book lays out the history of the development of the theory of evolution, and also a brief history of Shermer's journey from fundamentalist Christian faith to accepting the theory of evolution as true. Shermer attempts to give reasons why people disagree with evolution (and believe in religion). I imagine much of this material found its source in his other book Why People Believe Weird Things. Shermer researches the reasons behind the Intelligent Design movement and interviews its greatest supporters and determines that Intelligent Design is really just Creationism revisited. From this he determines that the argument to get ID into schools is an attempt to push the Christian religious views down the throats of children. He carefully notes that all of the major proponents of Intelligent Design are evangelical Christians except one. He also notes that no other piece of science has ever resorted to using political power to force its inclusion into the curriculum. He then goes through the 10 best arguments for Intelligent Design and attempts to disprove them. He shows that Intelligent Design is all about proving evolution wrong and offers no contributions of its own.Shermer draws on his theological background to show why Christians should believe in evolution. He also argues for a Non Overlapping Magisteria view of the relationship between religion and science (a la Steven Jay Gould). In other words, science can't contradict religion and vice versa because science is about the natural world and religion is about the supernatural world.Shermer ends by introducing the 10 greatest problems with the theory of evolution and shows where change is expected and more research is needed.My TakeAs one would expect from a man with a Ph.D. in the History of Science, Shermer does a good job of presenting the gradual accumulation of evidence for evolution over time. He gives us brief insights into the history of the debate between evolution and Christianity, and gives us some quotes from Darwin himself to show how he wrestled with his own ideas and their implications. Shermer also does a nice job of showing how Intelligent Design is *not* science, and is not helpful to scientists. Science is based on methodological naturalism, the assumption that everything has a natural cause. This limitation in scope is what makes science so good at what it does. A scientist can never throw his hands up and say ""It must be God"". There is no room for miracles. So scientists will search for the solution to a problem for generations! Scientists will proceed by trial and error forever to figure something out. That is why science has done such a good job of explaining how our universe works.Intelligent Design wants us to base our science on methodological supernaturalism, the assumption that some things have supernatural causes. But any scientist can see that this robs the scientific method of its greatest strength: its persistence. Now, any scientist working on any problem can just raise his hands and cry ""I can't explain it. It must be a miracle!""The right thing to do is not to include miracles into science, it is to show people the inherent limitations of science. I agree with Shermer on this point. Intelligent Design is not science.So, the first three quarters of this book, in my opinion, correctly show the evidence for evolution, the problems with ID, the history of the debate, and the underlying rationale of the ID crowd. All of this is worth reading. (Caveat: The justification of religion on evolutionary terms is weak almost to the point of ridiculousness)After that the book goes downhill fast, both in terms of quality of thought and quantity of evidence. (Exception: Chapter 10 on the problems in evolution is both honest and well done.) Shermer's attempt to show how religion and science are compatible is terrible. Shermer ""shows"" how religion evolved to make our evolved morals work better. This ""showing"" involves mostly suggestions of how it could have happened. Then he sallies forth with some philosophy showing how science and religion should relate to one another (the NOMA principle ... which isn't that bad, it's just poorly argued for). Shermer fails to impress there too. Finally, he adds an appendix to show how science can fill the void left by religion because religion is all about awe and science can inspire awe. So science is the new religion. Which is kind of what one would expect from a guy who has lived as a Christian, and felt like his faith betrayed him, and is looking for something else. The appendix should be required reading for anyone who does not believe that we should start educating our children on how science fits into the big picture of life. "
249,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61808093-alexander-rivas,4,"Being a Christian, I wanted to start to understand this whole evolution versus creation debate. I decided to read this book where I learned about Darwin, the setbacks both sides face in our society, and how a Christian can believe in evolution without going against his beliefs. I enjoyed this book and never felt upset or angered by its content."
250,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43784978-tracie-nicolai,3,Interesting. There are a couple of troublesome premises offered. Well done on the Darwin insights and educational impacts. 
251,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11566185-alan,2,"Needless to say, I disagree with the stanch naturalistic presuppositional tone in which this book was written. However, I picked this book knowing what to expect. Given that Michael Shermer is a militant agnostic, I don't expect him to write much differently. Honestly, I like Mike Shermer because he genuinely seems like a down-to-earth guy. Unfortunately, like the other mainstream atheist authors, he paints any worldview that doesn't coincide with mainstream Darwinism as an anchor that will inevitably slow the progress of science. This is discouraging to read because it is a complete misrepresentation of reality. Shermer ideologically assumes that intelligent design (ID) is a religious attack on science. This message is continuously communicated throughout the book. In his view, ID is a conspiracy against the ""scientific community"" (notice the presupposition that ID has nothing to add to the scientific dialogue) to demote science from a objective methodology of gathering information, testing hypothesis, etc... to throwing Bibles at children in schools. With this message being present throughout the book, it almost appears that regardless of what advocates of ID bring to the table, they will be dismissed before their ideas are even considered. It seems to be a philosophical commitment to rejecting anything with the possibility of a designer rather than being open to conclusions based on evidence, despite implications of a designer. Shermer attempts to take on some common ID arguments for the possibility of a designer. For example, the fine-tuning argument, as he admits, is the strongest argument for the existence of a designer. However, his treatment of it is horribly insufficient, especially when he is attempting to make 'the case against ID'. He treats to argument with sentiments like, 'the vast universe is empty space', 'the majority of the universe is inhospitable to life', and 'it is only in recent to time that the universe became finely tuned for life', just to name the highlights. He then resorted to saying that since the multiverse is a probable theory, of a potentially infinite amount of universes that exist, it's not surprising to see life existing under these types of improbable conditions. Clearly, it is irrelevant how occupied our universe is with life in order for it to be fine-tuned. Fine-tuning isn't contingent on the presence of life, life is contingent on the existence of fine-tuning. Without the presence of fine-tuning, the universe wouldn't be habitable. Since he has provided an insufficient refutation of fine-tuning, predictably, he enacted the multiverse theory to counteract the incomprehensibly improbable existence of fine-tuning of the universe for life. Despite what people like Shermer say about the speculative existence of a multiverse, there is no evidence for it and it plays a god-like figure in the ideologies of skeptics. Shermer attempted to treat the moral component of evolution near the end of the book. He declares that since objective morals exist, they are the result of biological evolution for the purposes of survivability. Under a Darwinian worldview, if true, they would have developed under the process of evolution and social conditioning. However, morals would not be objective. Meaning, there would not be a transcendent source for morality in which to judge moral actions. Essentially, no reference point in which to gauge moral good vs. bad. Shermer fails to address the ontological basis for morals under a Darwinian worldview. Maybe he completely overlooked it on the basis of this fact. A worldview is never appealing when you tell your adherents that there is no objective moral difference between Mother Theresa and Hitler.Overall, it was a good summary of the Darwinian point of view. Shermer is a good and qualified representative of this worldview. In my own opinion, it appeared that the ID position and overall ID motive on most matters was misrepresented to make the Darwinian position look better. Like I said, it's a mainstream book and you have to decipher the fact vs. the fiction."
252,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/369290-the-other-john,2,"The conflict between evolution and intelligent design is one of the warmer issues of the day. Since reading 
Darwin on Trial
, I've been in the design camp, but I've never been completely comfortable there. There's been too many times when a person whose opinions I respect blasts into intelligent design and I fumble about looking for an excuse for my position. And when some ardent supporter of my side starts laying on the propaganda, I likewise wince. So while I was back overseas, one thing I decided I should do upon my return to the land of the free and home of the public library was do some more digging on evolution. Specifically, I wanted to get some more info on how a supporter of evolution would respond to the main arguments of the design side. Well, this book was my first attempt at getting more info. Mr. Shermer was helpful in clearing away some of the confusion in my mind, but didn't draw me any closer to the evolution camp. The biggest favor that Mr. Shermer did was point out that the leading proponents of intelligent design are really creationists trying to sell their beliefs in a new package. I don't care for sales pitches regardless of who's doing the selling. That's the main reason why I would rate the book as waiting room material, despite the useful information it contains. Mr. Shermer has his own agenda to promote. As for the meat of the debate, I get the impression that, like the abortion conflict, the problem lies in the conflict of two different issues. By definition, science excludes the supernatural. If you can't observe it, measure it, study it, then you can't assume it exists. To bring divine revelation, namely, the Bible, into the science classroom, is a violation of the scientific method. I think what happened over the years in Western society is that many people have started to consider the scientific method the only source of authoritative knowledge. So while any good scientist will tell you that any scientific law or theory might be proven wrong some day, they will proceed to live as if the accepted laws and theories are the truth. Just as I live as if the Bible is the truth. So where does this leave me? Well, I wouldn't mind digging up some more info on evolution. I'm curious about the fossil record and just how many of the bones in the skeletons are real and how many have been imagined to fill in the gaps. But I also realize that I'm never going to have a simple, irrefutable argument as to why we should believe we're created. In the end, only the Creator can prove He exists."
253,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18061078-emma,1,"This book isn't about ""Why Darwin Matters"", it's an overview of what Intelligent Design is, how it's been used as a Trojan horse to try and sneak creationism into science, what its arguments are and why they're easy to debunk, etc. Shermer includes a lot of little factoids that are simplified to the point of being wrong, such as defining sexual selection as nothing more than female choice (although he does at least mention that other aspects of sexual selection exist in a later chapter) and saying things like ""ever since Darwin, [people have had an idea that was around long before Darwin]"". In a chapter focused mainly around why Christians shouldn't turn to intelligent design (because most of the ""Intelligent Design"" groups are run by evangelical Christians), he goes off on a random tangent about monogamy in which he projects his personal opinions onto nature with no evidence from biological research and demonizes men in the process (I know people throw around empty accusations of ""demonizing men"" whenever someone brings up sexism or toxic masculinity, but Shermer actually does it, along with infantilizing women and misinterpreting a study of college students in order to perpetuate the ""coy females"" stereotype that's been sneaking into biology for a while). Then, in the same chapter, he throws in a section about conservatives for some unknown reason (?) and starts rambling about Adam Smith and seems to argue for Social Darwinism, and makes up some nonsense about how evolution supposedly promotes some Malthusian, social Darwinist, extremely anti-Christian views (in the same chapter where he's trying to recruit Christians). There's no possible way this argument was written in good faith, because he's obviously done enough research to know that Darwinism isn't the same as Social Darwinism -- and even if it were, it's not something you should be promoting. Trying to get people to accept evolution by telling them that it will let them make up a pseudo-scientific argument in favor of whatever they already want to do, whether it's monogamy or laissez-faire economics or eugenics or anything else, is not an argument for evolution. Some parts of this book are pretty good as a basic overview of the topic (which is ""what's the Intelligent Design debate all about?"", not ""why does Darwin matter?""), but there are far better sources out there for this information, and I can't think of a reason to read this book when you could read almost anything else on the topic."
254,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3648143-rob,4,"When Michael Shermer surveyed people about their religious beliefs, asking them why they believed in God and why they thought other people believe in God, he found that people tend to invoke intellectual causes for their personal beliefs and assign emotional causes for the beliefs of others. While this trend may not be true for all people, a majority of people sampled exhibit this textbook attribution bias. I am certainly guilty of this, even to the point where I can’t help but question if my reading of this book is evidence of a further bias, the confirmation bias--a prejudice in which I form an opinion and seek out information that supports my already held beliefs thus reinforcing my supposed intellectualism on the topic. I can partly blame Mr. Shermer for my acute neuroticism. It was, after all, his book, The Believing Brain, that introduced me to most of the concepts that now affect my thinking. But, I don’t think this is a bad thing. Skepticism is a healthy attribute. Shermer’s book, Why Darwin Matters: The Case Against Intelligent Design does a much better job expounding on its subtitle than it’s primary title. It is not until the last page that Shermer reveals why Darwin matters (it’s because evolution matters, which matters because science matters, so there you go). The entire book is dedicated to dispelling the myths surrounding both sides of the creationism vs. evolution debate. Its longest chapter breaks down the ten best arguments for intelligent design (ID) and exposes them as unscientific religious propaganda. Shermer argues with tact, for the most part, avoiding the hyperbole one might expect in a book of this nature.The chapter covering ID in American public schools is particularly compelling for me because I have worked in a conservative school district where a dominant religion plays a huge role in what is taught in school. Shermer, a proud libertarian, would want a privatized school system where parents can choose to send their kids to whatever school they want, but he lays out his defense of evolution only science classrooms since most Americans are publicly schooled. He summarizes several court cases, and builds his defense primarily on the legal justification for evolution in the classroom. He explains that creationism can not be understood as science when we understand what science is."

On the other hand for those that have, it may seem a bit thin in some areas but even so he offers many new takes on the relation between the domains of science and religion. He also mentions and quotes several other authorities whose works go into evolution more deeply such as Dawkins, Margulis, Mayr, Gould, Fortey, Kenneth Miller, and others. He also comments on the writings of the main proponents of ID, such as Behe, Dembski, Meyer and Wells.At one point Shermer states that he was advised against debating proponents of Intelligent Design because it only served to give them credibility. As I read more of his analysis of the arguments on both sides I began to agree with his advisers. Nevertheless, Shermer makes the case that when the stakes become more than just winning a debate, when it comes down to whether science, or religion thinly disguised as science, will be taught in public schools, then someone has to step forward and shine the light of reason on the discussion.Shermer points out that is a relatively small minority of religious groups, primarily the 70% of evangelical Christians who do not accept evolution. The vast majority of mainstream Protestants and Catholics do accept evolution.He goes on to make the case that there are three possible approaches to the relationship between religion and science: 1) to make war on each other, 2) to combine, or 3) to co-exist in separate realms. The latter he says is the only rational option. “Believers can have both religion and science as long as...” they don't try to force the two together. “God is beyond the dominion of science, and science is outside the realm of God.”"
256,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1542839-mike,4,"This was quite a good defense of the neo-Darwinian synthesis. I think I tend to hold Michael Shermer in lower intellectual regard than, for example, Richard Dawkins, Daniel Dennett, or Stephen Gould. But this book is really an excellent, scholarly work. Like the best output by Carl Sagan, Shermer regards people's faith with seriousness and respect, at the same time using logic and evidence to build his own case. The book starts with a great, pocket description of what evolution is, and what natural selection is, followed by a list of the reasons that people use to reject it. He ranks these reasons by their intellectual rigor, then refutes them using science and the data that have been found since the 1800s. He deals with social Darwinism, the non-effect that Darwinism has on ethics and morals, it's non-attachment to nihilism. He then talks about debate tactics that intelligent design proponents use in debates against him, ranks them again, and points out the fallacy in each. He presents a case of why Christians should accept evolution, using the language of theology and even showing the influence of Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations on Darwin's work. The final chapter is a fascinating look at the actual modern controversies in evolution science, as opposed to those trumped up by ID supporters. Again, all in all, an excellent, concise use of philosophy, genetics, theology, biology, and history against the creeping ID movement. "
257,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6076331-ergun-coruh,4,"The publisher of Skeptic magazine was once an enthusiastic Evangelical Christian, but his ardent pursuit of a scientific education induced reconsideration. Now he staunchly advocates discriminating religion from science and in this book concisely defends evolutionary theory from the almost exclusively -Evangelical--Christian-backed concept of intelligent design (ID), aka creationism, aka creation science--the name changes whenever a suit over having public schools teach the idea as science gets shot down by a high U.S. court (the ID movement always appeals mere state-court decisions). Shermer debates ID often, and he expertly marshals point-by-point explanations of why evolution is worthwhile science, why ID isn't science at all, why ID criticisms of evolution are irrelevant, why science cannot invalidate religion, and why Christians and conservatives ought to accept evolution. His orderly presentation makes the book something of a reference manual on evolution, and only the historically minded will smile at his citation of congruence between evolution and Adam Smith as reason for conservatives to embrace evolution, for Smith's capitalism is a branch of classical liberalism.

But this was a good read as it breaks down the most common arguments against evolution and shows why biologists and naturalists reject and laugh at them. It's a good guide on how to argue with a creationist but things have changed since then and creationists are creating new arguments to justify their beliefs so this is a tip of the iceberg since creationists have some more arguments that this book doesn't cover, might need to do a little bit of research there. Along with covering all of the arguments and what your response should be to each, it also explains the different forms of creationism and intelligent design. Shermer might want to re-release it to provide updated information in the section explaining what we really don't know about evolution since a Google search into what we still don't know about evolution turns up a bunch of creationist sites and no actual answers to the question. If you are questioning the reasoning and logic behind the whole creationism thing then read this and decide which answer make sense between the science and the ideas from people that have no degrees in biology from a secular institution."

I'm giving it 4 stars because it's very informative and for the most part it's also enjoyable to read. Being a microbiologist and having previously read about ID I recognized many things in the text. However, I also understand that most people probably don't know so much about evolution or ID, and since ID is all about PR and propaganda it's easy to see that normal people don't immediately see it for what it is: a copy-paste of creationism with the word ""Designer"" replacing ""God"".This book is mainly aimed towards the American public, since it's in the US most of the Intelligent Design Movement exists. A big reason for this (also explained in the book) is the verdict of the Edwards v. Aguillard trial in 1987, where the US Supreme Court ruled that ""Teaching creationism in public schools is unconstitutional.."". This lead to the birth of the ""Intelligent Design Creationism"" and eventually a second court case, Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District in 2005, again with the court ruling that Intelligent Design is not science but merely Creationism pretending to be Science."
260,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1433053-james,4,"This was a very interesting primer on the evolution vs. intelligent design debate. It provides good talking points to arm yourself with if you plan to enter a debate with a creationist. It is interesting that the intelligent design movement is just a warmed over version of creationism that is trying to pose as scientific. Their main strategy so far has been to refute evolution. They do not have any research or evidence to back up any of their claims. The whole creationist mind set is based on ancient texts that can not be edited or updated when new evidence comes to light. Since they see the bible as the unerring word of God, they cannot incorporate the evidence of evolution because it renders their texts inaccurate. The creation myths of Genesis are understandable as a means for a Bronze Age civilization to explain their world. But given the tools and methods of science that we have now, there is no excuse to believe that the accounts of the worlds creation in the Bible are true. Get this book and read it. Then discuss with your creationist friends! "
261,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/828715-sonya-s,4,"Let's be fair: this is not a book for those already embroiled in the debates of creationism v. evolution. If you already have an in-depth knowledge of the theory of evolution, or have had extensive science classes, this book is not going to present any new material. However, I do recommend this book to people who are new to the debate, or to people who have just not thought about it that much.I'm a skeptic, and have read Mr. Shermer's various articles in Skeptic Magazine and through various skeptic websites, such as Skeptologists. Though I already knew most of the information presented, I found that Mr. Shermer was far less condescending than other skeptics I've read (I'm looking at you, Christopher Hitchens), and presented the material in an accessable, easy-to-understand matter. He carefully breaks down the sides of the argument and goes to show why evolution does, in fact, matter. What stuck with me the most, I think, was a question he posits somewhere towards the end of the book: why would anyone want to limit their deity to the physical realm in which we inhabit?"
262,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1264081-melydia,3,"I came away from this book with rather tepid feelings. It didn't feel like it flowed very well from point to point, and each point made felt glossed over, with a couple of bare sentences with a footnote. Shermer's survey of evolutionary biology was often unclear, but when he was in his element - that is, the psychology of belief and religiosity - the tone became smooth and easy to read. I especially liked his discussion of the evolution of morality and the Genesis revisit at the end. However, I found his discussion of logical fallacies fell flat, his responses to Intelligent Design arguments felt unsatisfying even to an evolutionist like myself, and he spent so much time referring to other books that I started to wonder what purpose there was in reading this one. I am not sure what the target audience of this book was, but I don't think I was part of it. Still, I do want to pick up some of Shermer's other works that fall closer to his own field of study. "
263,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51466379-morninglight-mama,3,"While I can't say with any shred of honesty that I understood the vast majority of this book, I can appreciate Shermer's emphasis on the so-called evolution vs. creationism or evolution vs. Intelligent Design debates. The simple bottom line is that evolution is science and both creationism and ID have no scientific basis, but are instead theological ideas and therefore do not belong in the same conversation of science. I know some people were turned off by his bouts of smugness or sarcasm throughout this book, but I could understand the frustration that could lead someone to communicate seemingly obvious arguments with a tinge of 'C'MON already!' I tried my best to get through the complex scientific jargon, but I mostly enjoyed the sections that discuss the more sociological perspectives of these 'conflicts' of ideas."
264,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/747149-jacob,2,"Honestly, I didn't finish this book. It offered no insight or argument that I already didn't know and understand. I'm also not sure how many people would find this book interesting. It's arguments against Intelligent Design from a former creationist. Creationists won't care what the arguments are and will avoid this on principle. Those with scientific interest and any basic knowledge should already understand this stuff. I guess there may be a market of undecided, open minded readers who aren't scientifically knowledgable, but are interested. In that circumstance, this would be a very good read. It's a slim book with clear, well-stated arguments, but I seriously doubt there are many people who would care or be interested who don't already know this stuff."
265,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/937966-mark,3,"Shermer has in the past presented ideas in an entertaining and inquisitive way. However, I think that that while this book certainly puts forward a clear argument why ID (Intelligent Design) fails, it does so with the caveat: there might still be something...Shermer is not an atheist, but an agnostic, and this book does not go the full route against Intelligent Design. That being said, the book is easy to read, and in the same style as Shermer's other excellent books such as Why People Believe Weird Things (a better book in my opinion). Intelligent Design fails absolutely as a scientific theory and Shermer makes that clear. However, the ""theory"" is still writhing in the dirt and Shermer walks away from the kill."
266,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61943-tamara,4,"Again, Shermer gets technical, but is still interesting. Not that I had to be convinced; evolution happened. One thing I like about Shermer is that he doesn't ridicule those who have religious faith, he just points out that the more literal sects (for instance, those who believe the Earth is only 10,000 years old) are just being stubbornly ignorant in ignoring irrefutable evidence that Earth is MUCH older than that. And he includes examples of scientists who have both strong religous faith and a belief in what science shows them to be true."
267,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/242253-sean-duffy,4,"There's nothing new here, but the text is clear and persuasive even though Shermer was preaching to the choir. I'm convinced that evolution happened and is happening (except for humans, for whom natural selection has been eliminated). ID's best arguments are explained and effectively dealt with. Still there persists the nagging question: why? As in, yes but, why? That question will remain unanswerable, and therein lies the only real argument for God. But this stuff about the Singularity is frightening. We should already be smashing the machines with our shoes."

For those that are leaning the other way, there's not enough there. I also had to raise an eyebrow at some of Shermer's reasons as to why conservatives and Christians should be pro-evolution.

Most of the book seems to be some history and background which is interesting, but not particularly focused. Personally, this book is weaker in its arguments than something like Faith vs Fact and Why Evolution is True by Jerry Coyne. It's a simple book but would not be my recommendation for a book that deals with evolution. The best thing he does in this book is demonstrate that Intelligent Design is a weakly disguised Creationism and that's it."
278,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2318453-paul,2,"The AuthorMichael Shermer is a former fundamentalist Christian turned skeptic. In fact, he started The Skeptics Society and is the editor in chief of Skeptic magazine. Shermer got his B.A. in Psychology from Pepperdine (though he began as a theology major). He went on to get his Master's in Experimental Psychology from CSU-Fullerton, and his Ph.D in the History of Science from Claremont. Shermer is the classic case of a Christian who turned his back on the faith when confronted with facts and then took up a career as an apologist against the faith (see also Bart Ehrman).SummaryThis book lays out the history of the development of the theory of evolution, and also a brief history of Shermer's journey from fundamentalist Christian faith to accepting the theory of evolution as true. Shermer attempts to give reasons why people disagree with evolution (and believe in religion). I imagine much of this material found its source in his other book Why People Believe Weird Things. Shermer researches the reasons behind the Intelligent Design movement and interviews its greatest supporters and determines that Intelligent Design is really just Creationism revisited. From this he determines that the argument to get ID into schools is an attempt to push the Christian religious views down the throats of children. He carefully notes that all of the major proponents of Intelligent Design are evangelical Christians except one. He also notes that no other piece of science has ever resorted to using political power to force its inclusion into the curriculum. He then goes through the 10 best arguments for Intelligent Design and attempts to disprove them. He shows that Intelligent Design is all about proving evolution wrong and offers no contributions of its own.Shermer draws on his theological background to show why Christians should believe in evolution. He also argues for a Non Overlapping Magisteria view of the relationship between religion and science (a la Steven Jay Gould). In other words, science can't contradict religion and vice versa because science is about the natural world and religion is about the supernatural world.Shermer ends by introducing the 10 greatest problems with the theory of evolution and shows where change is expected and more research is needed.My TakeAs one would expect from a man with a Ph.D. in the History of Science, Shermer does a good job of presenting the gradual accumulation of evidence for evolution over time. He gives us brief insights into the history of the debate between evolution and Christianity, and gives us some quotes from Darwin himself to show how he wrestled with his own ideas and their implications. Shermer also does a nice job of showing how Intelligent Design is *not* science, and is not helpful to scientists. Science is based on methodological naturalism, the assumption that everything has a natural cause. This limitation in scope is what makes science so good at what it does. A scientist can never throw his hands up and say ""It must be God"". There is no room for miracles. So scientists will search for the solution to a problem for generations! Scientists will proceed by trial and error forever to figure something out. That is why science has done such a good job of explaining how our universe works.Intelligent Design wants us to base our science on methodological supernaturalism, the assumption that some things have supernatural causes. But any scientist can see that this robs the scientific method of its greatest strength: its persistence. Now, any scientist working on any problem can just raise his hands and cry ""I can't explain it. It must be a miracle!""The right thing to do is not to include miracles into science, it is to show people the inherent limitations of science. I agree with Shermer on this point. Intelligent Design is not science.So, the first three quarters of this book, in my opinion, correctly show the evidence for evolution, the problems with ID, the history of the debate, and the underlying rationale of the ID crowd. All of this is worth reading. (Caveat: The justification of religion on evolutionary terms is weak almost to the point of ridiculousness)After that the book goes downhill fast, both in terms of quality of thought and quantity of evidence. (Exception: Chapter 10 on the problems in evolution is both honest and well done.) Shermer's attempt to show how religion and science are compatible is terrible. Shermer ""shows"" how religion evolved to make our evolved morals work better. This ""showing"" involves mostly suggestions of how it could have happened. Then he sallies forth with some philosophy showing how science and religion should relate to one another (the NOMA principle ... which isn't that bad, it's just poorly argued for). Shermer fails to impress there too. Finally, he adds an appendix to show how science can fill the void left by religion because religion is all about awe and science can inspire awe. So science is the new religion. Which is kind of what one would expect from a guy who has lived as a Christian, and felt like his faith betrayed him, and is looking for something else. The appendix should be required reading for anyone who does not believe that we should start educating our children on how science fits into the big picture of life. "
279,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61808093-alexander-rivas,4,"Being a Christian, I wanted to start to understand this whole evolution versus creation debate.

280,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43784978-tracie-nicolai,3,Interesting. There are a couple of troublesome premises offered. Well done on the Darwin insights and educational impacts. 
281,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11566185-alan,2,"Needless to say, I disagree with the stanch naturalistic presuppositional tone in which this book was written. However, I picked this book knowing what to expect. Given that Michael Shermer is a militant agnostic, I don't expect him to write much differently. Honestly, I like Mike Shermer because he genuinely seems like a down-to-earth guy. Unfortunately, like the other mainstream atheist authors, he paints any worldview that doesn't coincide with mainstream Darwinism as an anchor that will inevitably slow the progress of science. This is discouraging to read because it is a complete misrepresentation of reality. Shermer ideologically assumes that intelligent design (ID) is a religious attack on science. This message is continuously communicated throughout the book. In his view, ID is a conspiracy against the ""scientific community"" (notice the presupposition that ID has nothing to add to the scientific dialogue) to demote science from a objective methodology of gathering information, testing hypothesis, etc... to throwing Bibles at children in schools. With this message being present throughout the book, it almost appears that regardless of what advocates of ID bring to the table, they will be dismissed before their ideas are even considered. It seems to be a philosophical commitment to rejecting anything with the possibility of a designer rather than being open to conclusions based on evidence, despite implications of a designer. Shermer attempts to take on some common ID arguments for the possibility of a designer. For example, the fine-tuning argument, as he admits, is the strongest argument for the existence of a designer. However, his treatment of it is horribly insufficient, especially when he is attempting to make 'the case against ID'. He treats to argument with sentiments like, 'the vast universe is empty space', 'the majority of the universe is inhospitable to life', and 'it is only in recent to time that the universe became finely tuned for life', just to name the highlights. He then resorted to saying that since the multiverse is a probable theory, of a potentially infinite amount of universes that exist, it's not surprising to see life existing under these types of improbable conditions. Clearly, it is irrelevant how occupied our universe is with life in order for it to be fine-tuned. Fine-tuning isn't contingent on the presence of life, life is contingent on the existence of fine-tuning. Without the presence of fine-tuning, the universe wouldn't be habitable. Since he has provided an insufficient refutation of fine-tuning, predictably, he enacted the multiverse theory to counteract the incomprehensibly improbable existence of fine-tuning of the universe for life. Despite what people like Shermer say about the speculative existence of a multiverse, there is no evidence for it and it plays a god-like figure in the ideologies of skeptics. Shermer attempted to treat the moral component of evolution near the end of the book. He declares that since objective morals exist, they are the result of biological evolution for the purposes of survivability. Under a Darwinian worldview, if true, they would have developed under the process of evolution and social conditioning. However, morals would not be objective. Meaning, there would not be a transcendent source for morality in which to judge moral actions. Essentially, no reference point in which to gauge moral good vs. bad. Shermer fails to address the ontological basis for morals under a Darwinian worldview. Maybe he completely overlooked it on the basis of this fact. A worldview is never appealing when you tell your adherents that there is no objective moral difference between Mother Theresa and Hitler.Overall, it was a good summary of the Darwinian point of view. Shermer is a good and qualified representative of this worldview. In my own opinion, it appeared that the ID position and overall ID motive on most matters was misrepresented to make the Darwinian position look better. Like I said, it's a mainstream book and you have to decipher the fact vs. the fiction."
282,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/369290-the-other-john,2,"The conflict between evolution and intelligent design is one of the warmer issues of the day. Since reading 
Darwin on Trial
, I've been in the design camp, but I've never been completely comfortable there. There's been too many times when a person whose opinions I respect blasts into intelligent design and I fumble about looking for an excuse for my position. And when some ardent supporter of my side starts laying on the propaganda, I likewise wince. So while I was back overseas, one thing I decided I should do upon my return to the land of the free and home of the public library was do some more digging on evolution. Specifically, I wanted to get some more info on how a supporter of evolution would respond to the main arguments of the design side. Well, this book was my first attempt at getting more info. Mr. Shermer was helpful in clearing away some of the confusion in my mind, but didn't draw me any closer to the evolution camp. The biggest favor that Mr. Shermer did was point out that the leading proponents of intelligent design are really creationists trying to sell their beliefs in a new package. I don't care for sales pitches regardless of who's doing the selling. That's the main reason why I would rate the book as waiting room material, despite the useful information it contains. Mr. Shermer has his own agenda to promote. As for the meat of the debate, I get the impression that, like the abortion conflict, the problem lies in the conflict of two different issues. By definition, science excludes the supernatural. If you can't observe it, measure it, study it, then you can't assume it exists. To bring divine revelation, namely, the Bible, into the science classroom, is a violation of the scientific method. I think what happened over the years in Western society is that many people have started to consider the scientific method the only source of authoritative knowledge. So while any good scientist will tell you that any scientific law or theory might be proven wrong some day, they will proceed to live as if the accepted laws and theories are the truth. Just as I live as if the Bible is the truth. So where does this leave me? Well, I wouldn't mind digging up some more info on evolution. I'm curious about the fossil record and just how many of the bones in the skeletons are real and how many have been imagined to fill in the gaps. But I also realize that I'm never going to have a simple, irrefutable argument as to why we should believe we're created. In the end, only the Creator can prove He exists."
283,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18061078-emma,1,"This book isn't about ""Why Darwin Matters"", it's an overview of what Intelligent Design is, how it's been used as a Trojan horse to try and sneak creationism into science, what its arguments are and why they're easy to debunk, etc. Shermer includes a lot of little factoids that are simplified to the point of being wrong, such as defining sexual selection as nothing more than female choice (although he does at least mention that other aspects of sexual selection exist in a later chapter) and saying things like ""ever since Darwin, [people have had an idea that was around long before Darwin]"". In a chapter focused mainly around why Christians shouldn't turn to intelligent design (because most of the ""Intelligent Design"" groups are run by evangelical Christians), he goes off on a random tangent about monogamy in which he projects his personal opinions onto nature with no evidence from biological research and demonizes men in the process (I know people throw around empty accusations of ""demonizing men"" whenever someone brings up sexism or toxic masculinity, but Shermer actually does it, along with infantilizing women and misinterpreting a study of college students in order to perpetuate the ""coy females"" stereotype that's been sneaking into biology for a while). Then, in the same chapter, he throws in a section about conservatives for some unknown reason (?) and starts rambling about Adam Smith and seems to argue for Social Darwinism, and makes up some nonsense about how evolution supposedly promotes some Malthusian, social Darwinist, extremely anti-Christian views (in the same chapter where he's trying to recruit Christians). There's no possible way this argument was written in good faith, because he's obviously done enough research to know that Darwinism isn't the same as Social Darwinism -- and even if it were, it's not something you should be promoting. Trying to get people to accept evolution by telling them that it will let them make up a pseudo-scientific argument in favor of whatever they already want to do, whether it's monogamy or laissez-faire economics or eugenics or anything else, is not an argument for evolution. Some parts of this book are pretty good as a basic overview of the topic (which is ""what's the Intelligent Design debate all about?"", not ""why does Darwin matter?""), but there are far better sources out there for this information, and I can't think of a reason to read this book when you could read almost anything else on the topic."
284,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3648143-rob,4,"When Michael Shermer surveyed people about their religious beliefs, asking them why they believed in God and why they thought other people believe in God, he found that people tend to invoke intellectual causes for their personal beliefs and assign emotional causes for the beliefs of others. While this trend may not be true for all people, a majority of people sampled exhibit this textbook attribution bias. I am certainly guilty of this, even to the point where I can’t help but question if my reading of this book is evidence of a further bias, the confirmation bias--a prejudice in which I form an opinion and seek out information that supports my already held beliefs thus reinforcing my supposed intellectualism on the topic. I can partly blame Mr. Shermer for my acute neuroticism. It was, after all, his book, The Believing Brain, that introduced me to most of the concepts that now affect my thinking. But, I don’t think this is a bad thing. Skepticism is a healthy attribute. Shermer’s book, Why Darwin Matters: The Case Against Intelligent Design does a much better job expounding on its subtitle than it’s primary title. It is not until the last page that Shermer reveals why Darwin matters (it’s because evolution matters, which matters because science matters, so there you go). The entire book is dedicated to dispelling the myths surrounding both sides of the creationism vs. evolution debate. Its longest chapter breaks down the ten best arguments for intelligent design (ID) and exposes them as unscientific religious propaganda. Shermer argues with tact, for the most part, avoiding the hyperbole one might expect in a book of this nature.The chapter covering ID in American public schools is particularly compelling for me because I have worked in a conservative school district where a dominant religion plays a huge role in what is taught in school. Shermer, a proud libertarian, would want a privatized school system where parents can choose to send their kids to whatever school they want, but he lays out his defense of evolution only science classrooms since most Americans are publicly schooled. He summarizes several court cases, and builds his defense primarily on the legal justification for evolution in the classroom. He explains that creationism can not be understood as science when we understand what science is."

On the other hand for those that have, it may seem a bit thin in some areas but even so he offers many new takes on the relation between the domains of science and religion. He also mentions and quotes several other authorities whose works go into evolution more deeply such as Dawkins, Margulis, Mayr, Gould, Fortey, Kenneth Miller, and others. He also comments on the writings of the main proponents of ID, such as Behe, Dembski, Meyer and Wells.At one point Shermer states that he was advised against debating proponents of Intelligent Design because it only served to give them credibility. As I read more of his analysis of the arguments on both sides I began to agree with his advisers. Nevertheless, Shermer makes the case that when the stakes become more than just winning a debate, when it comes down to whether science, or religion thinly disguised as science, will be taught in public schools, then someone has to step forward and shine the light of reason on the discussion.Shermer points out that is a relatively small minority of religious groups, primarily the 70% of evangelical Christians who do not accept evolution. The vast majority of mainstream Protestants and Catholics do accept evolution.He goes on to make the case that there are three possible approaches to the relationship between religion and science: 1) to make war on each other, 2) to combine, or 3) to co-exist in separate realms. The latter he says is the only rational option. “Believers can have both religion and science as long as...” they don't try to force the two together. “God is beyond the dominion of science, and science is outside the realm of God.”"
286,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1542839-mike,4,"This was quite a good defense of the neo-Darwinian synthesis. I think I tend to hold Michael Shermer in lower intellectual regard than, for example, Richard Dawkins, Daniel Dennett, or Stephen Gould. But this book is really an excellent, scholarly work. Like the best output by Carl Sagan, Shermer regards people's faith with seriousness and respect, at the same time using logic and evidence to build his own case. The book starts with a great, pocket description of what evolution is, and what natural selection is, followed by a list of the reasons that people use to reject it. He ranks these reasons by their intellectual rigor, then refutes them using science and the data that have been found since the 1800s. He deals with social Darwinism, the non-effect that Darwinism has on ethics and morals, it's non-attachment to nihilism. He then talks about debate tactics that intelligent design proponents use in debates against him, ranks them again, and points out the fallacy in each. He presents a case of why Christians should accept evolution, using the language of theology and even showing the influence of Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations on Darwin's work. The final chapter is a fascinating look at the actual modern controversies in evolution science, as opposed to those trumped up by ID supporters. Again, all in all, an excellent, concise use of philosophy, genetics, theology, biology, and history against the creeping ID movement. "
287,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6076331-ergun-coruh,4,"The publisher of Skeptic magazine was once an enthusiastic Evangelical Christian, but his ardent pursuit of a scientific education induced reconsideration. Now he staunchly advocates discriminating religion from science and in this book concisely defends evolutionary theory from the almost exclusively -Evangelical--Christian-backed concept of intelligent design (ID), aka creationism, aka creation science--the name changes whenever a suit over having public schools teach the idea as science gets shot down by a high U.S. court (the ID movement always appeals mere state-court decisions). Shermer debates ID often, and he expertly marshals point-by-point explanations of why evolution is worthwhile science, why ID isn't science at all, why ID criticisms of evolution are irrelevant, why science cannot invalidate religion, and why Christians and conservatives ought to accept evolution. His orderly presentation makes the book something of a reference manual on evolution, and only the historically minded will smile at his citation of congruence between evolution and Adam Smith as reason for conservatives to embrace evolution, for Smith's capitalism is a branch of classical liberalism.

But this was a good read as it breaks down the most common arguments against evolution and shows why biologists and naturalists reject and laugh at them. It's a good guide on how to argue with a creationist but things have changed since then and creationists are creating new arguments to justify their beliefs so this is a tip of the iceberg since creationists have some more arguments that this book doesn't cover, might need to do a little bit of research there. Along with covering all of the arguments and what your response should be to each, it also explains the different forms of creationism and intelligent design. Shermer might want to re-release it to provide updated information in the section explaining what we really don't know about evolution since a Google search into what we still don't know about evolution turns up a bunch of creationist sites and no actual answers to the question. If you are questioning the reasoning and logic behind the whole creationism thing then read this and decide which answer make sense between the science and the ideas from people that have no degrees in biology from a secular institution."
289,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4758699-patrick,4,"It's a bit hard to judge this book. I'm giving it 4 stars because it's very informative and for the most part it's also enjoyable to read. Being a microbiologist and having previously read about ID I recognized many things in the text. However, I also understand that most people probably don't know so much about evolution or ID, and since ID is all about PR and propaganda it's easy to see that normal people don't immediately see it for what it is: a copy-paste of creationism with the word ""Designer"" replacing ""God"".This book is mainly aimed towards the American public, since it's in the US most of the Intelligent Design Movement exists. A big reason for this (also explained in the book) is the verdict of the Edwards v. Aguillard trial in 1987, where the US Supreme Court ruled that ""Teaching creationism in public schools is unconstitutional.."". This lead to the birth of the ""Intelligent Design Creationism"" and eventually a second court case, Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District in 2005, again with the court ruling that Intelligent Design is not science but merely Creationism pretending to be Science."
290,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1433053-james,4,"This was a very interesting primer on the evolution vs. intelligent design debate. It provides good talking points to arm yourself with if you plan to enter a debate with a creationist. It is interesting that the intelligent design movement is just a warmed over version of creationism that is trying to pose as scientific. Their main strategy so far has been to refute evolution. They do not have any research or evidence to back up any of their claims. The whole creationist mind set is based on ancient texts that can not be edited or updated when new evidence comes to light. Since they see the bible as the unerring word of God, they cannot incorporate the evidence of evolution because it renders their texts inaccurate. The creation myths of Genesis are understandable as a means for a Bronze Age civilization to explain their world. But given the tools and methods of science that we have now, there is no excuse to believe that the accounts of the worlds creation in the Bible are true. Get this book and read it. Then discuss with your creationist friends! "
291,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/828715-sonya-s,4,"Let's be fair: this is not a book for those already embroiled in the debates of creationism v. evolution. If you already have an in-depth knowledge of the theory of evolution, or have had extensive science classes, this book is not going to present any new material. However, I do recommend this book to people who are new to the debate, or to people who have just not thought about it that much.I'm a skeptic, and have read Mr. Shermer's various articles in Skeptic Magazine and through various skeptic websites, such as Skeptologists. Though I already knew most of the information presented, I found that Mr. Shermer was far less condescending than other skeptics I've read (I'm looking at you, Christopher Hitchens), and presented the material in an accessable, easy-to-understand matter. He carefully breaks down the sides of the argument and goes to show why evolution does, in fact, matter. What stuck with me the most, I think, was a question he posits somewhere towards the end of the book: why would anyone want to limit their deity to the physical realm in which we inhabit?"
292,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1264081-melydia,3,"I came away from this book with rather tepid feelings. It didn't feel like it flowed very well from point to point, and each point made felt glossed over, with a couple of bare sentences with a footnote. Shermer's survey of evolutionary biology was often unclear, but when he was in his element - that is, the psychology of belief and religiosity - the tone became smooth and easy to read. I especially liked his discussion of the evolution of morality and the Genesis revisit at the end. However, I found his discussion of logical fallacies fell flat, his responses to Intelligent Design arguments felt unsatisfying even to an evolutionist like myself, and he spent so much time referring to other books that I started to wonder what purpose there was in reading this one. I am not sure what the target audience of this book was, but I don't think I was part of it. Still, I do want to pick up some of Shermer's other works that fall closer to his own field of study. "
293,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51466379-morninglight-mama,3,"While I can't say with any shred of honesty that I understood the vast majority of this book, I can appreciate Shermer's emphasis on the so-called evolution vs. creationism or evolution vs. Intelligent Design debates. The simple bottom line is that evolution is science and both creationism and ID have no scientific basis, but are instead theological ideas and therefore do not belong in the same conversation of science. I know some people were turned off by his bouts of smugness or sarcasm throughout this book, but I could understand the frustration that could lead someone to communicate seemingly obvious arguments with a tinge of 'C'MON already!' I tried my best to get through the complex scientific jargon, but I mostly enjoyed the sections that discuss the more sociological perspectives of these 'conflicts' of ideas."
294,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/747149-jacob,2,"Honestly, I didn't finish this book. It offered no insight or argument that I already didn't know and understand. I'm also not sure how many people would find this book interesting. It's arguments against Intelligent Design from a former creationist. Creationists won't care what the arguments are and will avoid this on principle. Those with scientific interest and any basic knowledge should already understand this stuff. I guess there may be a market of undecided, open minded readers who aren't scientifically knowledgable, but are interested. In that circumstance, this would be a very good read. It's a slim book with clear, well-stated arguments, but I seriously doubt there are many people who would care or be interested who don't already know this stuff."
295,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/937966-mark,3,"Shermer has in the past presented ideas in an entertaining and inquisitive way. However, I think that that while this book certainly puts forward a clear argument why ID (Intelligent Design) fails, it does so with the caveat: there might still be something...Shermer is not an atheist, but an agnostic, and this book does not go the full route against Intelligent Design. That being said, the book is easy to read, and in the same style as Shermer's other excellent books such as Why People Believe Weird Things (a better book in my opinion). Intelligent Design fails absolutely as a scientific theory and Shermer makes that clear. However, the ""theory"" is still writhing in the dirt and Shermer walks away from the kill."
296,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61943-tamara,4,"Again, Shermer gets technical, but is still interesting. Not that I had to be convinced; evolution happened. One thing I like about Shermer is that he doesn't ridicule those who have religious faith, he just points out that the more literal sects (for instance, those who believe the Earth is only 10,000 years old) are just being stubbornly ignorant in ignoring irrefutable evidence that Earth is MUCH older than that. And he includes examples of scientists who have both strong religous faith and a belief in what science shows them to be true."
297,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/242253-sean-duffy,4,"There's nothing new here, but the text is clear and persuasive even though Shermer was preaching to the choir. I'm convinced that evolution happened and is happening (except for humans, for whom natural selection has been eliminated). ID's best arguments are explained and effectively dealt with. Still there persists the nagging question: why? As in, yes but, why? That question will remain unanswerable, and therein lies the only real argument for God. But this stuff about the Singularity is frightening. We should already be smashing the machines with our shoes."
298,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1447864-joshua-nomen-mutatio,4,"An excellent book to hand to those who deny the veracity of the continually enlarging body of evidence that supports biological evolution or think ""intelligently designed"" evolution is a well-supported idea, and even to those who say they believe that evolution is real yet don't quite understand why (a category which I've found many people fall under).Shermer is well-positioned to write towards the beliefs of the religious who think that evolutionary theory is bogus since he was once one them: Shermer was a evangelical Christian for a few years before rejecting the whole thing."
299,0805081216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/872094-pingpongabyss,3,"Decent book by Michael Shermer about the intelligent design debate. To be honest, I already knew all of the scientific issues from reading debates online, so I didn't learn much from it, but I do think the book probably does a good job at convincing people who are already at least leaning towards pro-evolution but don't know all the details yet. For those that are leaning the other way, there's not enough there. I also had to raise an eyebrow at some of Shermer's reasons as to why conservatives and Christians should be pro-evolution. The invisible hand? Are you kidding me?"
