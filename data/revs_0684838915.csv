0,0684838915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/379386-jessica,3,"I love this guy (see my review for A Primate's Memoir). And by far the best thing about this book is the insight into theoretical science based in biology: he'll provide a correlation between X and Y, provide strong evidence for causation from X to Y, then step back and provide evidence for causation from Y to X, then evidence for a non-causal correlation, and then he'll finally discuss experiments that have turned everything on its head and argued that Z causes X and Y.However, the majority of the content in this book is repeated in Monkeyluv (they also share a shocking amount of turns of phrase). What's more, a fair amount of that content is touched upon in A Primate's Memoir, where it is presented much more indepthly and interestingly.So, you should read these books if you loved A Primate's Memoir, but you should probably wait a few months so that you won't be annoyed reading the same sentence or paragraph over again. And if you only really think you'll read one, definitely make it A Primate's Memoir."
1,0684838915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3194586-elizabeth-atwood,5,"WOW! Dr. Sapolsky did not disappoint...he definitely has a spot on my top five favorite authors of all time. Not only are his stories eloquent and humorous, they are packed with facts and loads of interesting information on the brain, behavior, biology, environment, emotion, and his personal anecdotes sprinkled in here and there. And they can be understood by pretty much anyone who can read. Among my favorite essays in this book is ""How big is yours"", which explains the plight of individuals like myself (I suspect but have not confirmed) that suffered damage to their pre-frontal cortexes, especially before they were fully developed (not until age 21ish). The final chapter, ""Circling the blanket for God"", which I just read has me in a frenzied state I can't even begin to explain but to say that it has blown my mind. I'll try to explain a bit, just about the last page. He starts to talk about looking at his students over the years as science has advanced so rapidly and revealed the baffling complexity of the natural world. He says he sees them get uncomfortable about the philosophical implications of the idea that science and scientists will one day explain everything and in doing so take all the awe and wonder out of life, and to this Sapolsky responds, ""I am not worried if scientists go and explain everything. This is for a very simple reason: an impala sprinting across the Savannah can be reduced to biomechanics, and Bach can be reduced to counterpoint, yet that does not decrease one iota our ability to shiver as we experience impalas leaping or Bach thundering. We can only gain and grow with each discovery that there is structure underlying the most accessible levels of things that fill us with awe.But there is an even stronger reason why I am not afraid that scientists will inadvertently go and explain everything--it will never happen. While in certain realms, it may prove to be the case that science can explain ANYthing, it will never explain EVERYthing. As should be obvious after all these pages, as part of the scientific process, for every question answered, a dozen newer ones are generated. And they are usually far more puzzling, more challenging than than the prior problems. This was stated wonderfully in a quote by a geneticist named Haldane earlier in the century: ""Life is not only stranger than we imagine, it is stranger than we can imagine"". We will never have our flames extinguished by knowledge. The purpose of science is not to cure us of our sense of mystery and wonder, but to constantly reinvent and reinvigorate it."" And that's just a page.Wow!!! Another major bonus of this book is the art at the beginning of each essay. It's incredible and I can honestly say the next thing I do after I write this is going to be to Google Image almost every last one of them.If you have a curious mind, this book is most certainly for you : ) "
2,0684838915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47359134-steve-loh,5,Some of the finest essays I've read. On par with David Foster Wallace with the difference that it is applied to biology.
3,0684838915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1345046-todd-martin,3,"The Trouble with Testosterone is a collection of essays on the subject of biology by Robert M. Sapolsky a professor at Stanford University. More specifically Sapolsky examines some of the ways in which our biology influences behavior … topics such as: the influence of testosterone on aggression, the onset of puberty and an animal’s position in the social hierarchy, the evolutionary advantages of risk taking, the effects of stress on hormone concentrations in the body, the effects of a Westernized diet on baboons evolved for foraging (not surprisingly, they mirror those of humans), and the role of mental illnesses such as schizophrenia and obsessive compulsive disorder in the development of religion. Sapolsky is a good writer and the essays are interesting, although I thought he overstated the validity of several psychological hypotheses … for example: the five stages of grief (which are far from universal), the theories of Sigmund Freud (which have been almost entirely discredited), the causes of effects of depression and others. I suspect this is what happens when a person ventures too far afield from their area of expertise. "

5,0684838915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24463136-zachary,4,I want so badly to write like Sapolsky. Academic and casual. Fact-based and personally reflective. Smart and witty but not pompous. He is a gem of a science communicator. 
6,0684838915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57080100-sylvia-so,3,"As someone with no background in science whatsoever, I found this book at times difficult to read. There were essays that were fantastic, and others that were written a bit too pompously for my liking. I like when things are accessible, and at times this didn't feel so. I enjoyed reading something outside my comfort zone for once but it's not a book I would recommend to others like myself."

Even today we witness how socioeconomic inequity permeates every aspect of health care system.-Circling the blanket for God is a topic that would definitely offend a section of society as the it discusses few psychological traits that are commonly observed in shaman, God men and religious preachers.The observation about the obsessive compulsive behaviour behind some rigorous religious rituals and the how religion provide a safe hiding shelter for those with OCD might not please the faithful.-The rest of the topics in this book definitely are interesting and informative.Time and space constraints doesn’t permit me for a detailed review.The Author concludes his observations and writing saying that “Science could explain anything,but it will never explain everything, for every question answered, a dozen new one are generated.”As Haldane quoted “The purpose of Science is not to cure us of our sense of mystery and wonder,but to constantly reinvent and reinvigorate it.”"
9,0684838915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19746539-jenny-preston,3,"I found this collection of essays about the world and the human experience to be mostly interesting, if slightly disjointed. It is a collection - there isn't one unifying thought that ties the whole book together. The writing style is only ok due to some jumpiness and the other's clearly high opinion of himself. But mixed into that I found some fascinating stories, such as the culture of the apes he studied in South Africa and how they relate to human culture.My worldview is about as opposite as possible from the author, but I enjoy reading books like that on occasion for the mental exercise. The author is a self-declared atheist, evolutionist scientist. He even goes so far as to theorize religion is based on mental illnesses, specifically ""schizotypal"" (defined as having some tendencies characteristic of schizophrenia but not the full blown disease) and OCD. And yet, I caught on at least 2 occasions where he, possibly subconsciously, refers to a higher plan or power in the universe. Am I glad I read it? For the 50c I spent at a book sale, yes. Will I read it again? Highly unlikely."

I alwayes asked my self what is the wrong with the soldiers, why they are impulsive , why humans kill eachother?. It is really awesome. Moreover , There is a huge argument about the Theory of Father abscence. At some point i am into it , but on the other hand, it is a satistical conclusion."
11,0684838915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/196037-jrobertus,4,"a wonderful book of essays on biology and human nature. the last chapter, on ocd and religion, was extraordinarily interesting."

Sapolsky's The Trouble with Testosterone wrestles with the question of what makes humans who/what they are; where is the line which distinguishes who a person is from his biology? Are we just a product of different chemical reactions? Can we really be held responsible for the crimes we commit from a biological standpoint? What if all the traits we thought were only personal to us are ""nothing more than a not-terribly-unique form of primate?""Sapolsky does not answer the question for us, but he does bring some very fascinating research and anecdotes which point to how much biology plays a role in shaping who we are as human beings. With that said, I found his last chapter on how religious communities were formed by schizotypal individuals and their need for structure horrendous. Of course if you ignore the metaphysical dimension behind rituals, you will see the repetitiveness as what weird people do as an OCD thing to comfort themselves. Sapolsky does admit at the end that science won't answer all the questions, which I am thankful for because it shows that he is not completely submerged in the worldview of scientism just yet. "
13,0684838915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21961987-flamingo,4,"4.2 stars. Some great insights in here. Among the different topics discussed in these essays:- The moral dilemma of choosing to attribute negative behavior to genetics and ""nature"".- The effects of our environment on the onset of puberty- How and why monkeys change tribes once they've grown.- On how males and females (in general) view friendships throughout the years, and why old monkeys go through the harsh process of changing tribes.- Why some diseases/disorders like schizophrenia survive throughout generations despite, or rather, because of, evolution.- Why we care about what other people do and voyeurism.- The mechanisms behind the crummy feeling when we're ill.- How some animals seem to know how to cure themselves by finding medicinal plants etc in nature.- How the westernization of diets of people who have bodies that adapted to different environments has hugely detrimental effects- On two bodies representing the same self, and how we sometimes absorb mannerisms of our deceased loved ones.- A hypothesis on how religion evolved so many intricate, specific rituals because of individuals with OCD throughout history.-1 for his unconvincing argument in the ""curious George pharmacy"", and some grammatical mistakes sprinkled throughout the essays."
14,0684838915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2603816-martina,5,"Sapolsky had me with this gem of an introduction: ""We all have encountered Reinhold Niebuhr's serenity prayer at some point: 'God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, courage to change the things I can, and wisdom to know the difference.' Behavioral biology is often the scientific pursuit of that prayer. Which of our less commendable ways of behaving, asks the behavioral biologist, can we hope to change (and how) and which are we stuck with? Asked in a harsher way-- as our society so often poses these questions of nature and nurture-- for which of our failings should we be held responsible? . . . [W]hat is the biology of what makes us who we are, what is the biology of our individuality, our limits and potentials."""
15,0684838915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9579846-kaitlyn,3,"A thought-provoking read; it would be good to have strong evidence to back up the links that he makes, particularly when making a jump from animal to human behavior based simply on similar neurobiology. Additionally, it seems that much of his assumptions are largely rooted in Western constructions of normality, with little consideration for non-Western behaviors. Ultimately, I found this book to contain much to make me think, and little to make me believe, despite the given facts. Perhaps that is the point, after all--not to take everything at face value, and to instead consider all of the possibilities."
16,0684838915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71935584-ben-zimmerman,4,"The essays in The Trouble with Testosterone are a delight to read. Sapolsky deftly translates a lot of his primate research to much deeper topics about morality and society. Are humans special? How do we define responsibility? What do we owe to each other and world? Sapolsky is clear that science doesn’t answer the questions he is highlighting – in fact, a lot of the moral problems that we wrestle with in the book are caused by scientific discovery, not resolved by it."
17,0684838915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57235399-mary-newcomer,4,"Mr. Sapolsky is one of my favorite professors. I watched one series of his lectures at Stanford on Youtube and learned so much. I have a literary background, but he explains everything so clearlyand in such an engaging manner. He's so much fun to read!He has changed my viewpoint on so many subjects and I can only thank him for clarifying so manymisconceptions. As you can see, I highly recommend this book to all.You will learn a lot."
18,0684838915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69494865-miri-niedrauer,2,"Most of the essays in this book represent barely-coherent ramblings with occasionally mildly interesting facts about biology and human/animal tendencies. Although a scientist by profession, his writing does not come off scientifically-based at all. Additionally, it is nearly impossible to even deduce what subject the author is rambling about for much of the beginning of each chapter, leading to a difficult and confusing read. "
19,0684838915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71103538-krokki,5,Bravo! Robert Sapolsky and neurobiology (/neuroscience) is a goddamned gift to humanity - like the methaphorical apple from the three of knowledge in Garden of Eden. I can't wait for the future to unravel more psycho stuff from the studies of brain biology - I'm very optimistic that we can find out some long awaited secrets and treatments of mental illnesses in the years ahead.

I was worried it may be too jargon-y or dry for me, but he explains things simply and succinctly, and has a sharp sense of humor so it wasn't boring in the slightest. Super interesting insights about testosterone, religion, killing, and empathy"
33,0684838915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22894919-lance-hartland,2,"I was hoping this book would be more like a compendium of research about testosterone. Unfortunately, there is only 10 pages or less dedicated to that subject. I guess I was misled by the title, which is purely my fault for thinking that one word in a title would imply the thesis for the book. The book had great research on a wide variety of topics, but minimal material on the subject that originally attracted to me to this book. Since my expectations weren't met, and considering the disinterest I battled while reading this book, I give it two stars. Avoid the book if you think you'll learn much about testosterone, read the book if you are interested in the connections between obsessive compulsive disorder and religion or hypothesis as to why male baboons migrate to different baboon tribes and why female baboons don't. I think this book appeals to a very small sect of people, mainly scientists who specialize in anthropology, primatology, or psychiatry. "
34,0684838915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/108414461-sebastian-langan,5,"Sapolsky is one of those extremely articulate minds that are too few and far between in the world of scientific research and communication. He's a remarkable storyteller, and in this work, he inserts a number of clever and insightful bits of commentary into issues like religion, neuropsychology, and behavior. Highly reccomend!"
35,0684838915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1808251-diogenes,4,"Behavioral biology is a fascinating field of research: how a lifeform's physiology is affected by environmental factors, such as why deer begin to grow antlers in springtime. When applied to homo sapiens, however, it becomes a muddy mess when juxtaposed against psychology, sociology, and neuroscience. Beautiful in its abstraction, the whole field seems to implode when looking at individuals because there is no pinpoint ""ah-ha"" thing capable of being nailed down. As a herd, however, such abstractions are useful. The Trouble with Testosterone is a collection of articles and essays digging hooks into behavioral biology alongside zoopharmacognosy, neuropsychiatric disorders, and the behaviorism of religiosity. Ultimately these works help us question, ""What do we make of the fact that at point after point, our traits prove us to be nothing more than a not-terribly-unique form of primate?"" A deeply complex, bio-chemically driven form of primate, but primates nonetheless. Naturally such subject matter flirts more deeply with philosophy than science; however, the abstractions of ""being human"" are really compelling to the inquisitive, while I could envision bible-thumpers clutching their St. James a bit more tightly. Sapolsky's ending essay does a fine job of philosophically examining the links between metamagical thinking with schizotypal behaviors, and ritualistic imperatives with obsessive-compulsion needs for religious founders and their historic first flock, whether looking at Charles Manson or Martin Luther (no, I'm not comparing these two together; they are yin and yang to the possibility of the linkage identified by Sapolsky, even if the wars of the Reformation were far, far worse). We are organisms whose behaviors all have meaning, whether they are consciously, subconsciously, biologically, chemically, environmentally, socially, historically rooted, or some fascinatingly ornate combination thereof. To know thyself is to better oneself. Reading this book might wedge open a new door. "

37,0684838915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/377051-jason-edwards,4,"I’d like to think that my reading Sapolsky would have been inevitable. My dad read Why Zebras Don’t Get Ulcers and much later a friend of mine read A Primate’s Memoir. Last week, another friend shared an All Things Considered broadcast about testosterone, which reminded of this collection of Sapolsky’s essays. I’ve read it before, but I have this idea that as we live our lives we change, as readers, so I wanted to give it another read.Sapolsky is an endocrinologist, and if we can stretch the term, something of a behavior scientist. The thing about learning is, I think we all like to do it, one way or another. So I’m being careful when I say: it’s not that Sapolsky makes science interesting, it’s that he writes so well, we have access to how interesting science is. And that’s saying something. Too often science-writing wallows in thick boring sentences, or almost dissipates in pop-styled bubbles. Sapolsky writes beautifully, and so we can be the curious explorers that we naturally are.So far I haven’t said anything about this book specifically, as opposed to any of Sapolsky’s books fit for laymen (all of which I've read). I guess I want people to read everything. But, for what it’s worth, this collection of essays is as good as any to start with. He touches on many subjects, offering up questions and showing how science is trying to answer those questions, and the pitfalls waiting for jumping to conclusions too soon.You could go into this book looking for answers about how your mind works or why your body does the things it does, and you might learn a thing or two. But if we read for the sheer pleasure of reading, The Trouble With Testosterone is as good as any work of fiction."
38,0684838915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20265475-gaby,4,"Robert Sapolsky is a very interesting guy. He is a professor of neuroscience and biology at Stanford University and his main focus is studying primates and how us humans relate to them. This book includes three sections that explain the biology of our human behavior, the evolution of biology, and social and political implications of findings in biology. My main focus was the chapter ""Measures of Life"". In this chapter, Sapolsky explains the reasons why we make the choices we make, who are considered guilty and innocent, and what scientists try to accomplish in their career. The most interesting part of this chapter was when Sapolsky explained the reason why certain methods of executions have been used. One scenario that Sapolsky introduces is executions of early-nineteenth-century militia. Five men would be told to fire their guns at a prisoner, and one of the men has a blank bullet. After the shots are fired and the prisoner is killed, it is hard to say who actually killed him. None of the men knew who had the blank bullet; so none of them carry guilt on their shoulders to be held responsible for the death of that prisoner. Guilt is something that many of us try to avoid, and it would be extremely hard to live with yourself knowing that you were the one who killed the prisoner. By keeping it a mystery, no one has to live with knowing they were the one who killed that prisoner. I think this has a lot to do with why people never own up to their own guilt or are able to accept what they have done wrong."
39,0684838915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20361349-geordi,4,"A relevant compendium of essays examining psychological scenarios and predicaments caused by physiology. Many of these scenarios are modern and have applicable commentary. During the chapter titled Beelzebub’s SAT Scores, he describes a certain type of people, geeks, and compares their lives to Ted Kaczynski, the unabomber. He was known as an incredibly intelligent, but later deranged individual. The entire chapter compares Ted’s scenario to Sapolsky’s experiences, claiming that intelligence and social isolation can give rise to a breed of strategic, angry killers. Sapolsky provides meaningful testimony and insight from his experiences at Harvard, stating that neuroticism and aggression can originate from an enlarged frontal cortex. For many, the stories of kids getting punished in the school halls for being intelligent are familiar. Most, as they grow older, live normal lives. Yet some exact revenge, like Ted. Sapolsky asks the relevant question: do these acts of violence come from one’s nature or their upbringing? An awkward adolescence can create an awkward adult, and an awkward adolescence can create a murderous one. Classmates and coworkers can easily become a Unabomber, it is relevant to know that intelligence and isolation can be a violent combination. These kinds of stories are all familiar, as many see these people all the time, but there is not a substantial difference between Ted Kaczynski and the loner down the hall. Saposky successfully provides a neurobiological take on the subject of killers."
40,0684838915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/417915-kevin,5,"What a collection of fascinating essays! The way biology and neuroscience form the foundation of our personality traits is a complex and sensitive subject, but Dr. Sapolsky is a brilliant scientist and writer, and his storytelling skills are edutainment at its finest. Sapolsky discusses the subject of personality characteristics and their biological foundations. He explores the possible philosophical extensions of such science, both for the potential benefit of our species, or for its harm. The links between highly religious personalities and science's biological label schizotypal personality disorder examines this relationship. A religious personality may well be a blend of a number of personality traits for which homosapiens have selectively bred (or at least tolerated and not extinguished). In tribal times, the shaman was a revered tribal role, and hearing voices, talking with God, preferring long periods of isolation in the wilderness, being somewhat antisocial, etc. weren't traits that our modern culture and science perceive as undesirable. The highly ritualistic nature of religious ceremonies lends itself quite well to those who manage obsessive compulsive disorder, as Martin Luther's story itself demonstrates. The far less politically sensitive connections and lessons about adolescent primate wanderlust and irrational, if not reckless, behaviors was very insightful for me as a high school teacher. This book is outstandingly enlightening, just like all of Sapolsky's others. VERY HIGHLY recommended."
41,0684838915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19446286-elentarri,4,"Robert Sapolsky is a Professor of Biological Sciences, and Professor of Neurology and Neurological Sciences, and by courtesy, Neurosurgery, at Stanford University, and his main focus is studying primates and how us humans relate to them. This is a collection of well-written, candid, humorous and interesting essays about the biology of human culture and behavior, the evolution of biology, and the social and political implications of these biological findings. Each essay contains interesting information (and some personal anecdotes) on the brain, behavior, biology, and environment. The book is easily understood by the non-scientist but not simplified so much that the scientists will want to rip their hair out. Each essay is concluded with a reference section for those who want more detailed information on that specific subject. The book is only slightly dated, as research has progressed and new information has emerged on certain subjects since its publication, but the vast majority is still valid. My favourite story is probably “Junk Food Monkeys” in which Sapolsky relates the adventures of a troop of baboons in Kenya who stumble upon a tourist garbage dump. The essay on the relationship between schizotypal behaviour, OCD and religion (shamanism and institutionalized religions) is also very interesting. "
42,0684838915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18956574-christina-schilb,4,"Fast-forward to modern day medicine doctors and students are able to learn the anatomy of a body and find out its cause of death with out digging up a corpse. In the U.S. we have people who donate their body to science. So we are able to learn from these bodies with out disrespecting the dead. Many doctors study cadavers that range from wealthy to poor because they want to learn and study the internal organs from different classes. Sapolsky wants us to be careful when we are making new discoveries because society is judgmental. He feels that if you are going to say something that is against the norm make sure that you have the facts to back it up. I felt that this book provided me with insight on how doctors used to study and how their discoveries affect our modern day medical world. Health science and nursing majors will find this chapter and the book helpful and interesting, because it pertains to what they are studying in their classes. "
43,0684838915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3606206-colleen-coffin,5,"I bought more than one copy and gave many of them away to family-- that's how excited I was about this book. Robert Sapolsky is an intense thinker and brings issues into the forefront of science that ordinarily would be left to philosophers and social scientists. He has an uncanny knack to take various murcky, potentially soft-minded issues and churn them through the rigorously scrutinized Stanford research institution's most esteemed and touted paradigms of discovery and present them to the public with matter-of-fact closure and jaw-dropping enlightenment. I don't agree with him on all points (for example, he is an athiest) but his work is like a treasure, nonetheless and everyone should be forced to learn from him (as he boldly proclaims at the beginning of his series of lectures posted on YouTube)"
44,0684838915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9430739-andrei,5,"This collection has some strong and captivating pieces, my personal favourites are the ones about life in Africa, the mechanics of why people feel sick when they're sick, and the way poverty alters anatomy. I wish they all had the same kind of depth that he gave the last essay on religion (which would have been my favourite piece if I hadn't already seen a presentation he did about it), as it feels like they sometimes end abruptly.. although I think my wish would be partly granted if I get ahold of 'A Primate's Memoir'. The baboon anecdotes are absolutely adorable. I wasn't big on the email exchange in the chapter on self-medicating animals, and material such as the titular piece wasn't so gripping since I've repeatedly watched the lecture(s) where he's covered it but I can't hold that against him since few are going to be such gushing fans of his as I am. "
45,0684838915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9441641-adam,5,"I was hoping the book would be on testosterone, but it was more ""other essays."" Still good, though. This book is especially interesting in that it was written a short time after the death of the author's father. You can see how the essays sometimes weave into that turbulent point in his life - the book culminating on the conjectured origins of religion. Topics include determinism and free will, social dimensions of baboon life, stress ((from an interesting comparative, non-human primate to human primate perspective), religion and neuroses, Western imperialism and its unintended consequences, the Unabomber (?!), how the immune system functions, and more.All very interesting. Dr. Sapolsky writes in a very accessible way and peppers his essays with his trademark humor. "
46,0684838915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3810553-athena-macmillan,4,"This took me a long time to read, not because it was boring or difficult but because each chapter is a different essay so it's a good book to just pick up, read a chapter, and put away for the next time you feel like an anthropological hit.I have always enjoyed Sapolsky's writing, and this is no different. Don't be fooled by the title, this isn't a book on feminism. It is collection of Sapolsky's essays from his studies in behavior and anthropology with a smattering of psychology; each one looking at a different aspect of human social interactions and examining the biology and evolutionary reasoning behind each.If you're into this kind of thing, you'll love it. But you do have to be into it."
47,0684838915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/90798-christina,3,"3.5 stars, really. Written by a guy that studies baboons, the whole book serves as a reminder that we're not as unique as we think we are, that every action we take might have less to do with our worldview or the decisions we think we're making freely and everything to do with the way certain parts of us are wired. Sapolsky does a good job, though, of finding the beauty in our humanity anyway, refusing to fall into defeatism or general grumpiness.The final essay, which wonders about the similarities between the way religions work and the way the minds of people with schizophrenia and OCD work, was extraordinarily interesting. It made me think a lot."
48,0684838915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2072674-aj-payne,4,"This one isn't as funny as a Primate's Memoir, but it's just as good. It's along the same lines as Monkeyluv in that it's a collection of essays written over time in different scientific magazines and then compiled into a book. Some of the research is a bit dated (some of the essays are old) but it's fascinating. If you are interested in biology, human behaviour, and other topics like that (you don't have to be smart about them, he speaks very plainly so anyone can understand) I recommend this one. Along with all his other books!"
49,0684838915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2282003-chic2sd,4,"The bro in law gave me this book.. Really interesting to see the scientific view of how a man functions while making so many decisions in one's life based on Testosterone. The different chapters were so cool. One chapter that I remember is in regards to how male primates function in packs with testosterone evident in all their daily decisions. It was a nice switch to go to a scientific book, that related real day stories to the human anatomy. I really believe that all men should at least give this book a shot. I love the cover too... "
50,0684838915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1824225-michelle,5,"This is a book of essays by one of my favorite science writers. It is well-written, each essay neatly organized, informative and entertaining. A few of the first essays went over facts and ideas I was already familiar with, but as the book goes on, the essays just get better and better, bringing up novel ideas, and new supporting information about them. The essays about the fallacies about testosterone and the one about some of the unforeseen results of westernization were my favorites."
51,0684838915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5259600-nicki,5,"This book was insanely fun to read, in such a way that made Robert Sapolsky seem like a really fun and intelligent guy to know. Some of it seemed a little outdated coming from 14 years in the future, but it was still great. I love books that completely cement my desire to go into the sciences like this one did. Maybe I'll think of it every Tuesday morning as I get up at 7am for a three-hour biology lab. Eugh. "
52,0684838915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2274193-kelly-wagner,5,"I've heard the author speak at a convention, and he's a very entertaining speaker, as well as an entertaining writer. His topic for his talk was approximately the last essay in this book, ""circling the Blanker for God"" - to simplify the thing too far, it's about how a touch of schizophrenia seems to produce religious visions and how it's possible that many religious prophets may be explained by schizophrenia and why such a trait would survive in the population."
53,0684838915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16789296-debra-brunk,4,"I really enjoy Sapolsky's writing, which I was introduced to in ""Why Zebras Don't Get Ulcers"". He makes science interesting, fun and easy-to-understand. In this book, Sapolsky focuses on seemingly random scientific trivia, providing background, research and his thoughts on each. This book is a fun way to learn a little bit more about things you may not have thought about before. Unfortunately, Sapolsky leaves his least fleshed out and least supported topic for last. "
54,0684838915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2493659-jenifer,4,"Thought-provoking essays that read like a combination of peer review flame war and memoir. Sapolsky says outrageous things with wit and style and backs them up, concisely, while providing a section at each chapter's end including the correspondence that flew between himself and the outraged scientists he roasts. I particularly liked his theory about why schizophrenia is still in the gene pool, specifically how schizotypal and OCD behaviors founded religion. "
55,0684838915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1340839-jeremy,0,"This book was recommended to me by a colleague. She said it is fun to read but also describes some great science. I can't think of a better way to describe it than that. Sapolsky is a great writer and has great stories to tell. He does anthropomorphize a bit, but he's not nearly as bad as many others involved in behavioral science."
56,0684838915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3178329-crosby,3,"I really like this ""MacArthur Genius"" neurobiologist/Stanford professor. His essays are always thought provoking and open ended. I am using the ""Why you feel crummy when you are sick"" essay as required reading in my immunology class. I like his ""Monkey Love"" book better than this one only because it was more consistently thought provoking "
57,0684838915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4316683-tris,4,"It's such a beautiful thing when scientists can write. Very complex, very interesting biological stuff made easily accessible and told with a lot of humor. I got interested in this author when I heard him talking on the radio about stress as a killer (The topic of another of his books, Why Zebras Don't Get Ulcers). He's smart. He's funny. Read him."
58,0684838915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9544145-theresa,3,"The geneticist and evolutionary-biologist Jack Haldane once said that life is stranger that we can imagine. Humans, I think, represent the pinnacle of strangeness. In this collection of ""essays on the biology of the human predicament,"" Sapolsky tackles some of our oddest quirks, in witty insightful prose that examine the interplay between human individuality and biological fate."
59,0684838915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7515660-brian,4,"One of the better books I have read on fairly technical stuff. Sapolsky has a way of writing that makes you feel like you are having a conversation with a friend, albeit a friend that I probably would disagree with a lot, but it would always be fun and educational. I think the last two chapters could have been dropped and the book would have been better, but it was worth the read."
60,0684838915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2531665-charlene,5,"This is some of Sapolsky's best work. He challenges the many assumptions that have come from various studies in the field of neuroscience. Is it really testosterone that makes us aggressive? Or, does it matter how aggressive you were prior to the experiment? Baseline aggression is a more significant factor in how respondents will behave if given heightened levels of testosterone. "
