0,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/175635-trevor,5,"I was talking to a friend at work about this book and we agreed it was both very good and very long, perhaps even too long. Sometimes, when you are at a symphony concert, the first movement will end with ‘da – da – da – daaaaaa’ and some people in the audience will clap, something that annoys all of those who know you are only meant to clap right at the end of the piece. Like I said, this book is very long and in three parts – and at the end of the first part I was getting ready to clap and thought, hang on, there seems to be an awful lot of this left. This book is disturbing – and not just a little disturbing, I’ve been thinking of ways to do without Facebook and Google – that level of disturbing.I think a large part of the problem people might have with this book is the same problem a lot of people have with advertising. I think most people think advertising might work on other people, other people being, by definition, a bit thick – but to suggest it might work on them is close to the biggest insult you can offer them. Sure they drink Coke – but not because they want to teach the world to sing in perfect harmony, but because, you know, it tastes good. People are so convinced they operate as free agents and that they know this because they base their decisions on a rational appraisal of the evidence before them, that the notion they might be ‘influenced’ by advertising has to be rejected outright because it would undermine their self-opinion and their notions of self-worth. All of which is particularly good news for the advertisers.The author starts this book with a story about her house catching fire and while she was waiting for someone to come put it out, she rushed about ‘saving’ things. The problem was that once the fire brigade arrived she was the thing they felt they most needed to save. She had never been in a house fire before and so this unprecedented situation seemed much safer to her than it actually was. This is the situation she says we are in with surveillance capitalism. We have never had this level of surveillance before, we believe we are getting stuff for nothing (google, facebook and so on) but actually our lives are being used as the raw behavioural material that is being used to manipulate us in ways we can barely understand. And it will only get worse. And this influence isn’t happening in ways we might think it is. That is, this isn’t about you writing to your mum that you have been thinking about buying a drone and then you getting lots of ads on your feed for places to buy drones. Yeah, I’m sure that shit happens, but it is nothing at all compared to what is really happening. There is a lovely bit in this where she discusses poker machines and how they have been designed by psychologists to provide the perfect environment of reward so that it stops being about winning and losing, but about getting you to continue to play. The longer you play, the more you lose. But the environment has been constructed so as to ensure that even looking away for a second feels like a kind of loss. And this is about as good a description of facebook (or as someone I know calls it face-crack) as I can think of. Except with facebook the rewards are to do with your own self-esteem, so looking away is even harder. And this isn’t even the worst of it. I’ve read quite a few books on behavioural economics – essentially it says that you can provide nudges to people and they will behave in ways that you want them to. This is generally presented as something good – like in Nudge itself, where people save more for their retirement if you construct a form in one way rather than in another. Or the example changing the form for organ donation from opt in to opt out and the rates of donation increase accordingly. You know, who is going to argue with that? Saving for your retirement is a good thing, donating your organs is a good thing. Except, the people who run facebook and google actually don’t make their money from you donating your organs – they make it from selling your behavioural data to people who want you to buy shit you don’t need or who want to work out what frightens the shit out of you so they can get you to vote for Trump or for Brexit. And they did. And it works. Even if you didn’t vote for either of these, it still works. Democracy doesn’t work by shifting those at the ends of the distribution – it works by shifting those in the middle. But we are all left with the consequences. 48% of the people of Britain are living with the consequences of what looks from the outside like - holy Jesus...What the gathering and analysis of the dross of our lives (aka data) allows is the most disturbing and powerful means imaginable for influencing us – and the worst of it is that we will not even know we are being influenced. In fact, this I-know-you-better-than-you-know-yourself is often presented as a feature of the new system – you’ll walk into a bar and the bartender will already know your favourite drink and might even have it ready for you. Yeah, thanks for that...A lot of this book discusses notions of operant conditioning and therefore it is a reprise of something like Plato’s republic – except his republic was to be run by the disinterested philosopher kings, people uninterested in money and worldly goods, who were judged (by whom?) to be the best and brightest and to be those worthy of organising society for the rest of us -even of telling us lies to make our little lives feel more comfortable. The republic we are entering with our eyes tightly closed is one where the philosopher kings have been replaced by the selfish and the greedy and we have given them the means to influence us in worlds they create and construct so that those worlds meet their own desires for us. I’ve always seen Plato’s republic as a dystopia – but what we are living in has no comparison. It is terrifying beyond words. I wish this book wasn’t nearly so long – I would recommend it wholeheartedly then. You still do need to read it, though. Sorry."
1,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1912247-dominik,3,"An important, albeit flawed, book. Viewing the rise of Google and Facebook through the lens of sociology, this makes for some heavy reading as one swims among the book's unique vocabulary (""the will to will,"" ""division of learning in society,"" ""double movement,"" ""shadow text,"" ""extraction imperative,"" ""prediction imperative""). Eventually the phrases begin to make their own sort of strange sense, but it definitely feels foreign. Perhaps I haven't read much sociology, so this failing may be my own. I do wish the book were written in simpler, less highfalutin prose.Surprisingly, there are no data at all in this book. None. I went in expecting analyses of the economic gains from Google and Facebook contrasted to some approximation of the social costs imposed by them. Or of small businesses enabled by these platforms. Or any economic analysis at all. There's none. This isn't that sort of book. Google and Facebook's ""dispossession"" of ""people's lives"" are presented as obvious. Showing a targeted ad based on a search or a user profile is apparently, to the author, something tantamount to stealing their very soul.The book's arguments are weakened by its purple prose. ""Rivers of blood"" are not, in fact, flowing because of surveillance capitalism. We digital natives are not, in actuality, being mercilessly slaughtered by Conquistadors Page, Zuckerberg, and Nadella (the author explicitly makes this analogy over several pages). I understand the author's desire to provoke ""astonishment and indignation"" but I found these hyperbolic passages less than persuasive.Despite the book's heft, there's much it doesn't cover. There's no discussion of pre-internet data brokers (credit card companies and credit bureaus, anyone?) There's no consideration of the privacy controls that Google and Facebook offer (much of the ""extraction imperative"" can be entirely turned off in each's privacy settings), nor that many valuable services are provided for free that do directly improve folks' lives. Nor any examination of other, far darker players in ad tech and social media. There's no discussion of k-anonymity, sparingly little of encryption, one fleeting mention of blockchain (expressing disapproval that smart contracts subvert the fundamental human values imbued in the ancient practice of contracts). The treatment of ML is decidedly non-technical and more akin to seeing ML as magic fairy dust than wrangling with its very real shortcomings (surprisingly, ML fairness doesn't get a mention).The author ends by envisioning a nightmare scenario of B.F. Skinner's wildest dreams where, like players in Pokemon Go, our entire lives become subject to the careful nudges and variable rewards promulgated by the ""high priesthood"" of data scientists carefully tuning the all-knowing, all-seeing machine learning system. Prediction becomes control and the machines take over ""the human hive."" Ooo... kay.All that said, this book is still worth the read, if you can stomach the hyperbole and dense prose and can exercise empathy toward the author's very real fears of seeing democracy and free society swallowed up by powerful corporations that tap into and manipulate human hopes and fears. There is love poured into these pages, love of humanity in its culture and its unpredictable freedom, and that in itself makes the book worth the investment. At the same time though, there's little love for Google or Facebook or technology in general -- and quite a lot of fear, uncertainty, and doubt.Disclosure: I am an employee of a big tech company, but the review above is solely my own opinion and not that of my employer. I've also tried to review the book without bias and through neutral eyes."
2,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32804270-michael,3,"Paints a frightening portrait of the rise of mass surveillance since the start of the Information Age. In ornate, often opaque, prose Zuboff charts the development of a new form of global capitalism that aims to surveil all facets of human existence and, using vast stores of privately held, ruthlessly gathered data, predict and modify user behavior to align with desired commercial outcomes. "
3,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76183450-lucas,2,"I’m giving this book 2 stars, in hopes that the surveillance capitalists at Amazon will not recommend others like it to me. In terms of research, this book deserves a higher rating. It is incredibly thorough and well sourced. But here is an example of a sentence the author, Shoshanna Zuboff, uses: “This time, we have sent them into the raw heart of a rogue capitalism that amassed its fortune and power through behavioral dispossession parlayed into behavior modification in the service of others’ guaranteed outcomes.” All the great research she’s done is described in the most alarming wording possible. It is a book filled with hyperbolic conclusions that are often not justified by anything other than the alarming wording she uses. I have two theories about why that is: 1) She assumes that anyone willing to read the book already agrees with her conclusion that the collection of data by Google represents nothing short of the end of individual freedom. So if everyone agrees, she doesn’t need to explain why something like Pokemon Go taking users to stores is bad, because it’s just so obvious. 2) She’s not actually writing for a contemporary audience, but an audience in the distant future when everything she warns about has come true. This might sound like I’m joking, but she talks in the introduction about her work being inspired by Marx, because he saw what capitalism would be when it was still an unprecedented phenomenon, and later says that one of her conclusions unites very well with Thomas Paine. So the stakes are very high for Zuboff. Beyond the conclusions being what they are, the writing in general is too much for me. I usually don’t complain about writing being too dense/academic/pretentious, but here is another sentence that exists in this book: “Orwell’s chilling final passages fulfill the life of that dry seed planted at the turn of the century in Italy’s impoverished soil and nourished by war, deprivation, and humiliation to flower in the nightmare of Nazi Germany and the apocalypse of Stalin’s Russia, finally to bear fruit in Orwell’s imagination: a testament for all time to what Mussolini had called the “ferocious totalitarian will” and the souls on which it feeds.” It is a generally grating read, and it doesn’t help that the book is twice as long as it needs to be. I’m not sure that all “behavior modification” by social media or data science is bad. (I should disclose that I work in data science, so ignore this whole review if you want). For example, a lot of people on the Goodreads app probably read more often than they would without the app, because of the social sharing aspect and the recommendation systems. This makes Amazon more money when people buy books from them. Is this bad? Most people on this app would probably agree that reading is good. Targeted advertising is not inherently bad either. For instance, I will never buy a truck. I don’t have anything against people who have trucks, but I have no interest in ever owning one. I hope every AI system in the world picks that sentence up, because it is my dream to watch a football game on the weekend and never see another truck commercial for the rest of my life. Am I saying that there is nothing to be concerned about here? Of course not. As Zuboff points out, a lot of the data that companies have on consumers now leads to an unprecedented level of information and power. Power is vulnerable to abuse. Data can be used in ways that impair freedom and I’m concerned about that. That’s why I bought this book. But data can also be used in a lot of positive ways. Self-driving cars can virtually eliminate accidents from the road. Zuboff misleadingly quotes an internal memo at Google about self-driving cars and their ability to learn from collective car data storage, and uses it as an example of surveillance capitalists “lamenting” that people aren’t more like machines. It’s a very important subject, but Zuboff’s portrayal and conclusions are just way too much for me."
4,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14941179-anna,5,"This will be a long review, so let me summarise it with tweet-like succinctness: ‘The Age of Surveillance Capitalism’ is Black Mirror for people who hate fun. I definitely mean that as a compliment. It synthesises and analyses a wide range of ideas I’ve come across in leisure and work reading during the past few years, mostly in articles online. As fragments, those ideas filled me with concern and confusion. Combined into the clear and systematic structure of a book, they fill me with dread, but the alleviation of confusion is very powerful. Zuboff sets out a convincing and shocking analysis of the recent turn global capitalism has taken towards intensive data-gathering, behavioural prediction, and pervasive surveillance. While I think it could have been equally effective at slightly shorter length, that is probably influenced by the unwieldiness of the hardback I got from the library. I really appreciated the measured pace and excellent explanations. Zuboff coins a number of useful descriptive phrases, none more helpful than that in the title. The vagueness of ‘late capitalism’ has always irritated me; ‘surveillance capitalism’ has a punchy accuracy. Zuboff is a great writer, with a consistent ability to identify key points without becoming reductive or sensationalist:Surveillance capitalism’s ability to keep democracy at bay produced these stark facts. Two men at Google who do not enjoy the legitimacy of the vote, democratic oversight, or the demands of shareholder governance exercise control over the organisation and presentation of the world’s information. One man at facebook who does not enjoy the legitimacy of the vote, democratic oversight, or the demands of shareholder governance exercises control over an increasingly universal means of social connection along with the information concealed in its networks.Zuboff centres her overall enquiry into surveillance capitalism on three fundamental questions: who knows? Who decides? And who decides who decides? The answers are disquieting, to say the least. It amazes me that so many people I know seem unconcerned about the amount of data the big five tech companies (Google, Apple, Facebook, Microsoft, Amazon) have about them and how it is used. Not only do these firms have far more data about us than we can readily understand, its individual value is irrelevant in comparison to the value of it all in aggregate. Zuboff uses the term ‘economies of scale and scope’ for this. Big data is valuable because machine learning models require vast amounts to produce useful results. For work reasons, I recently taught myself data mining and basic machine learning in R. It was alarming to realise how easy to use yet fundamentally opaque big data analytics are. Neural networks aren’t really analogous to human brains in structure or function. The real similarity is that in neither case is it known why you get the result you do. Moreover, like human brains, neural networks makes mistakes. However their mistakes are very different to those of humans, and generally depend on how much data they’ve been trained on and what forms it took.Zuboff does not discuss such technicalities. If you want an introduction to machine learning, I suggest this youtube video. She is, rightly, more interested in the data that google and others gather to feed machine learning models, which then predict our behaviour in order to sell us stuff. Once limited to your computer, the imperative to gather more and more behavioural data increasingly invades daily life via the internet of things:The very idea of a functional, effective, affordable product or service as a sufficient basis for economic exchange is dying. Where you might least expect it, products of every sort are remade by the new economic requirements of connection and rendition. Each is reimagined as a gateway to the new apparatus, praised for being ‘smart’ while traditional alternatives are reviled for remaining ‘dumb’. It is important to acknowledge that in this context, ‘smart’ is euphemism for rendition: intelligence that is designed to render some tiny corner of lived experience as behavioural data. Each smart object is a kind of marionette; for all its ‘smartness’, it remains a hapless puppet dancing to the puppet master’s hidden economic imperatives.Zuboff is especially good at explaining how it came to this: how big tech seized a specific historic moment when neoliberal economics, the war on terror, and advances in information technology converged. The big five’s tactics for avoiding regulatory control or even admitting what they actually do are set out chillingly well. While all this has certainly been discussed before, it is expressed especially well here. A slew of short articles over years are hard to distil sense from, whereas this book sets out the situation with admirable clarity. Chapter eleven lists characteristics that have allowed surveillance capitalism to take root, despite the fact that the Western population consistently claim to value privacy. The range and impact of these characteristics certainly makes sense of how we got here: lack of precedent, declaration as invasion, historical context, fortifications, the dispossession cycle, dependency, self-interest, inclusion, identification, authority, social persuasion, foreclosed alternatives, inevitabilism, the ideology of human frailty, ignorance, and velocity. The most novel part for me was an exploration of the philosophy underlying surveillance capitalism. Since big tech aggressively avoids articulating such a thing, based on the spurious claim that data is totally neutral, this was especially interesting. Zuboff labels it instrumentalism and contrasts it powerfully with totalitarianism:Totalitarianism operated through the means of violence, but instrumentarian power operates through the means of behavioural modification, and this is where our focus must shift. Instrumentarian power has no interest in our souls or any principle to instruct. There is no training or transformation for spiritual salvation, no ideology against which to judge our actions. [...] It is profoundly indifferent to our meanings and motives. Trained on measurable action, it only cares that whatever we do is accessible to its ever-evolving operations of rendition, calculation, modification, monetisation, and control. [...] Totalitarianism was a political project that converged with economics to overwhelm society. Instrumentarianism is a market project that converges with the digital to achieve its own unique brand of social domination.I particularly appreciated the link Zuboff made with behavioural economics and its rejection of the rationality assumption, while keeping all the other reductive and dubious assumptions of free market economics. The ‘nudge’ ethos of behavioural modification to optimise outcomes is entirely consistent with surveillance capitalism. Whenever I’ve read behavioural economics books over the years, the same questions come to mind: first off, why are you so amazed to have discovered very basic psychology? Secondly, whose behaviour are you nudging, why, and for whose benefit? This idea of nudging or tuning behaviour is deeply unsettling and contains potentially massive hidden contradictions, quite apart from its ethical implications. What if two companies in the big tech oligopoly try to push behaviour in different directions? Surely the vague aspiration of making the world run more smoothly and efficiently (whatever that means and for whom) is in conflict with the anger and violence social media stokes in politics? I was slightly surprised that only towards the end of the book does Zuboff broach the corrosive political effects of social media, such as the spread of fake news and an adversarial, reductive, and angry political culture. In a way, she hardly needs to. The prior chapters set this up well, by explaining the ‘radical indifference’ that big tech has for the actual content it feeds to its users. The only aim is to increase revenues via a business model of maximising attention and engagement on the platform(s). If divisive, dangerous, and totally inaccurate material gets clicks and comments, then that’s good enough for facebook and google. They take zero responsibility for the consequences this has on politics, culture, and society, despite profiting massively from them. I’m actually glad this wasn’t mentioned earlier in the book, as it’s so depressing that it would have pulled focus from the economic and philosophical foundations beneath the surface. As has probably become clear, I consider this a deeply thought-provoking and helpful book that has made my view of the world we live in a little clearer. That is the pinnacle of what you can hope for in non-fiction, in my view. Nonetheless, I didn’t agree with every word of it. Zuboff treats surveillance capitalism as a successor to industrial capitalism, stating several times that the latter wrecked the environment and now the former is wrecking the human soul. While I don’t disagree with this, I think surveillance capitalism is also making it much harder to deal with the consequences of industrial capitalism (which still exists as well! Smart phones don’t just manifest from the aether). Action to deal with climate change has been derailed by reactionary populist politics and a false equivalency between scientific research and conspiracy theories. The complex and long-term nature of environmental problems is totally unsuited to the acceleration and superficiality of social media. Moreover, surveillance capitalism is still capitalism, thus all about economic growth, increasing consumption, and wasteful energy use. I think these links should have been acknowledged a little more. Much like financial capitalism, surveillance capitalism is a parasite upon industrial capitalism; will it drain its host until they both die, I wonder?I think the weakest material is in the final chapter, which considers how young people are growing up with pervasive internet surveillance that stunts their sense of self. This is more speculative and lacks the rigor and conviction of the other chapters. Which is not to say that I find the concept uninteresting or unimportant. Here, though, it is treated as something of an afterthought. The psychological effects of constant connectivity and a norm of performative content sharing, especially on children, deserve their own books. Mixing macro and micro-level analysis can be risky; this is a macro book and that is its great strength. It is salutary to compare ‘The Age of Surveillance Capitalism’ with Paul Mason’s Postcapitalism: A Guide to Our Future, which I read in 2015. Mason covered some similar ground, but drew very different conclusions that now appear remarkably naive. The contradictions that he suggested would bring down neoliberalism are resolved by surveillance capitalism. Mason wrote, and I agreed when I read it, that big tech’s control over data was fragile and unsustainable. I no longer believe that; the past four years have seen consolidation and expansion of google and facebook’s control over data. Over the same period, it has become evident that such data can be put to dangerous purposes with a total absence of democratic accountability. According to free market economic theory, the infinite supply of data should make it worthless. Quite the opposite occurs, as data becomes more and more valuable as its scale and complexity increases, because it can be used to make quicker and more accurate behaviour predictions, and to influence behaviour. Certainly not in a free market, though. Google, amazon, and facebook are in unassailable economic positions. Any company that tries to compete is bought by them. The only threats to their dominance come from outside the market: regulation, essentially. Breaking up their monopolistic positions is part of public discourse, for example the proposals of Elizabeth Warren, a potential Democratic presidential candidate in the US. As with oil companies, though, there is great reluctance to face the fundamental problem: their business model. Oil companies have no place in any world that takes climate change seriously, because we must stop burning oil. Likewise, pervasive surveillance and data gathering have no place in any world that values privacy. Reliance on secretive behavioural monitoring and modification should also stop, but a ban on them seems even further away than a ban on burning oil. At present they appear inextricably linked with the internet, just as energy systems seems inextricably linked with fossil fuels. In both cases, the two developed interdependently, but their linkage isn't inevitable. The possibility exists of other energy systems and other forms of internet. To my mind, the first step to imagining better is understanding the flaws in what we have.I am more pessimistic and negative about social media than most people I know, quite possibly most people in general. While it can have positive consequences, the fact that it is optimised by a handful of companies to take our data and sell us shit makes it fundamentally flawed. The internet has a lot of potential to bring people together; social media as currently constituted is more likely to push them further apart. I wonder whether Trump could have become president without twitter and facebook? Frankly I doubt it. The irony of my posting this on a social media site owned by amazon is not lost on me; this is how we live now. ‘The Age of Surveillance Capitalism’ takes the reader beyond the endless noise of twitter et al in an attempt to explain the underlying theory and structure of 21st century capitalism. I found it an invaluable guide that solidified ideas I already had, as well as introducing new concepts and raising new questions. Be warned: I’m probably not going to shut up about this one for a long while. Probably best to read it now, so you can make up your own mind."

If I have one complaint, it's that she gets super carried away with metaphors and flowery language--it was actually quite annoying. But Zuboff takes a long view of history and situates the new era of surveillance capitalism within parallel trends in markets, culture, and law. She makes some brilliant observations--her comparison of surveillance capitalism with totalitarianism was especially interesting. Sometimes I think she overstates the dangers, but it's a nice and necessary challenge to the technoutopians and the denialists who claim that nothing is new. She also challenges some of the older fears about the surveillance state. She's not worried about state surveillance. She's worried about the intrusion of markets into all of our private spheres. I appreciated her references to Polyani and Arendt because it was useful to connect political totalitarianism and the great transformation of the markets into newer spheres "

With data mining and machine-learning capital is closing in on the last spaces that belong to us our private lives and thoughts. If that sounds creepy and totalitarian it is. With money to be made on our thoughts, behaviors, and inclinations silicon valley is using computers, smartphones, smart homes, and sensors to map out every thought and behavior we have to maximize profit. It also seeks to shape our behavior for maximum revenue as well. The players are known but how they operate is veiled. They know everything about how we operate but we know little about their secrets. This asymmetry ultimately makes them powerful and reduces our power. It is the difference between master and puppet. If that sounds bad to you it gets worse all of this is happening with little pushback from a slow-moving public or democratic governance. The thing about a book like this is it highlights what we feel is happening already. That creepy ad after you click on a website that follows you around for days.

8,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13716226-murtaza,3,"A few years ago I read Yuval Noah Harari's book Homo Deus, a whimsical look at our looming technological dystopia. Harari's book struck me as being happily resigned to the end of human freedom and indeed the end of humanity as we know it. This book could be described as the pessimistic and despairing counterpart to Harari's work. It goes over many of the same themes: the predictive power of Big Data, the loss of human freedom and the intrusion of surveillance technology into every corner of our lives. These things are all genuinely bad and troubling. Having said that I found the authors analysis to be somehow overly bleak. There is a fundamental trade-off in having a free service like Google Maps. We get powerful, unprecedented assistance in navigation. In turn, they get our data which they use to refine their models of predictive human behavior. This probably isn't fair once you understand the full scope of what you are losing and maybe we should all demand a new modus vivendi. The book fails to describe it as a trade-off however. Instead it is depicted as us being literally conquered and enslaved by a foreign force, repeatedly analogized to the conquest of the Tainos by the Spanish conquistadors. This hyperbole is woven throughout the generally dense prose of the book. There is tons of information here. It doesn't necessarily say much that will be new to a relatively informed audience. I found this a bit disappointing given the breathless reception that the book has received. The repeated invocations of philosophers and renaissance poetry also felt a bit overwrought.Having said that, I am in sympathy with much of the book's argument. We definitely have regressed to some sort of feudal economic arrangement, even while retaining the minds and desires of modern people. No wonder so many feel unhappy, despite their relative material wealth. The ubiquitous presence of sensory and data tracking equipment is setting human beings up for something unimaginable. Every movement, thought and impulse is on the way to being tracked and recorded in a powerful predictive text that can only be read by our new tech industry overseers. We are on the way to becoming laboratory rats in a maze designed to fine-tune our behavior, mainly for the purpose of controlling us and extracting our wealth. Every new gadget and app, often given for free or sold at cost price, is a new spy intended to capture as much behavioral data as possible. You don't need to enjoy the author's lurid prose to see that her words contain some truth.Are there any solutions here? Only a vague gesture towards the need for more democracy. While that may be true I found it to be a predictable and somewhat lazy way to conclude the book. I feel it is not right to hammer out hundreds of pages of dire information without even formulating a plausible solution. Yes, the problems are articulated are real and critical. As the author acknowledges though, the tide is so overwhelming most have resigned themselves to drift along its course. How do we counteract this feeling of resignation? That would be a significant question to answer.Were it possible I would give this book 2.5 stars of out of five. I would recommend any of the numerous essays about this subject out there, as well as Harari's more engaging overview."

Zuboff refers to ""overthrow"", the end of democracy as we know it, the reshaping of all human nature. She turns to a metaphor of the Taino before meeting Columbus, as they were wholly ignorant of the atrocities of war he was about to unleash upon them.""Surveillance capitalism"", a term the author coined, is not all imagined. It is still a term that can refer to the bargain that users make when they use free websites such as this. The users of a website are not the consumer, they are the product, as their use data and product history is sold to big marketers or advertising firms. Zuboff calls this 'behavioral surplus'. On Goodreads, this is benign - I can talk about books with friends for free, and I get recommended new ones. No harm done. The problem lies in what is referred to as the ""internet of things"" - household objects or new device which track more of the user's location and behavior. Exercise equipment, thermostats, refrigerators, phones, mattresses, and doorknobs are connected to the internet. All of this is sent to ""behavioral futures markets"", and the general public simply does not know their personal information is treated this way. Legal regimes on monopolies or privacy law do not encompass the current situation - and who reads the terms of service anyway?Zuboff is best when she does the work of journalism and digs through patent files and internal documents. The antagonists of her story are Facebook and Google, and their grand ambitions in business jargon for human society. But where Zuboff loses me is her exaggeration of their hold on society, of how much change they can carry out, and of how powerless most people are. I personally share her skepticism, but not her ""inevitabilism"", to use her term. Where adblocking tools are powerful and widely shared and where targetted lists of consumer data can still be sabotaged (see what happened to the Tulsa rally), advertising is not as powerful as is thought. What makes me the most doubtful at present is Facebook's own scandal where it inflated by a significant margin the count of how many of its users visited its ads, and big companies can and do pull their money and go elsewhere. If digital advertising really is so easily ignored, then why would big businesses bother with such a wide net at all?While there are social costs to intrusive advertising and Zuboff is right to doubt, I admit things are as bad as she says. Those ships have not sailed. "
10,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5917740-nilesh,1,"Data privacy or unauthorised (and wrongly allowed) usage of an individual’s private data by someone else are critically important topics. However, this comprehensively one-sided book does not even scratch the surface of the issues at hand.The whole book is a repeated polemic on almost any data gathering, analytics and companies that have successful businesses running on them. The highly coloured and simplistic view of the evils of Google and Facebook (it is largely about these two and a bit about Microsoft) in such a long book ensures that the author never even gets started on discussing the real problem, let alone any solutions beyond calling for all of us to say “No”.The author - who yearns for the pre-digital era utopia of almost anytime in history including as late as the 1980s - is a twenty-first century, Rousseau-like romantic. She happens to be a critic of our era modernity but if she was from some other era, she might have hated television or automobiles or combustible engines with equal gusto. In this book, she comes out as someone who hates collection of almost any data, and analysis based on them, even though if approached with these charges, she will flat deny them. The author never understands that there is no turning back from the current point, that the digital era has some enormous positives along with many negatives, that most negatives cannot be wished away, that many of the negatives are structural intricately joined to the massive positives, that authorities cannot fight or even understand many evils that are transforming continuously, etc etcLet’s build slowly to see how complicated the issues of data ownership are before we even look at the commercial aspects:- There is that age-old question: if a tree falls in a jungle with no “one” to observe, does it make a sound or does it “count”? If you twist this question in the digital contexts, how do you define the “one” doing the measurement? Is my privacy invaded if my “personal” data - however defined - are “seen” by programs?- The author will say a resounding yes to the question posed above based on what one reads in the book. Here, if I have a program living on my machine analyzing the private data to give me some results on what I am looking for - like a friend’s contact details - is my privacy invaded?- what if some incoming data - say a barrage of ten billion ads or news articles - are sorted by some program on my machine to filter out the likely unimportant ones for me based on my past habits as stored on my device - is this an invasion?- if not, how is the same an invasion if the same things are stored or processed on hardware located millions of miles away?- how does anyone explain complex analytical tools to me? Need my apps to analyze only to the extent I/humans understand? If yes, how will we ever progress in fields of quantum physics, genetics or other behavioural sciences?One can go on and on. The point is that issues of what is private data or understandable analysis are complex: the author seems to hate any analysis of “my” data for almost any commercial use. However, the same author would despise- if search and many other similar functions were charged and were so expensive due to the lack of scale that only the elite of the world benefited from them- Or if my lack of data-sharing did not solve her health or traffic or many similar solutions- Or somebody prevented smart analysis of “my” data that might have helped me find the right education, right connections, right entertainment, right news amongst a plethora of choices out there.- Or if the companies forced not to “nudge” offered no choice architecture (like no search) which is far worse than some choice, or offered the same “choice” without customisation to all- Or if lack of free storage of my data - like health over decades - did not offer me the same health or financial advantages as somebody who could afford such storageThe author does not see how free/cheap access to information, analysis, storage, health, entertainment, etc has benefitted the underprivileged of the world since the onset of the digital revolution. Is the surplus enjoyed by the digital elite at the cost of the rest? Or is there a win-win, where we may charge them of keeping a disproportionate amount, but not accuse them of plunder? The new era technologies have many negatives that need to be discussed and solved. Most of them are not what this author talks about in this book. The book is written by someone who yearns to be a digital hermit and feels she cannot. She is rightly frustrated by this viewpoint;  it is nigh impossible to completely go dark as it is no longer just about devices under my control with the surveillance of millions of other varieties.  That said, there are likely to be extremely few who could truly go back to such isolation for long now. "
11,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1750696-george-anders,3,"In The Age of Surveillance Capitalism, Shoshanna Zuboff argues relentlessly that the rise of Google, Facebook, etc. has done something terribly wrong to society. She's alarmed by all the surreptitious information-gathering that goes on in the background. She's especially troubled by the way we're deluged with personalized ads, every time we go on the Internet. And she wants us to be alarmed, too.Her book touches on some fascinating questions. Do we want a world that cherishes sanctuary, or that provides effortless socialization? Do we want the right to be forgotten, or easier opportunities to become known? If we want a bit of both, how do we balance these trade-offs?I would have loved to read a book that combined her relentless probing of tech's potential excesses with a realistic sense of what we've gained and lost at each step of the way. But that's not what we get. Instead TA0SC is weirdly colored -- in fact sometimes outright poisoned -- by endless nostalgia for a supposedly better time, long ago. I've lived through the multi-decade transformation that Zuboff describes. Things weren't better back then! We're talking about the days of taking outdated paper maps on road trips, instead of having in-dash nav. Or looking up hotels in a Frommer's guide, instead of tapping into the detailed listings and reviews on TripAdvisor or Airbnb. Looking back on it, information was maddeningly costly, slow and hard to obtain back then.Even if some aspects of today's digital connectivity seem silly or unnerving, when you add it all up, we're enjoying much better lives with Internet-era tools. To cite one more example, we've evolved from narrow knowledge cartels (where encyclopedia salespeople in the 1970s preyed on poor families) to a much more equitable world where easily accessible Google searches can get you up to speed on almost anything, no matter what your income.I'd hoped this book would be a landmark contribution to the dialogue about how to handle tech's allures and pitfalls better. Instead, it's as frustrating as a partial encyclopedia set that stops at the letter D. For me, at least, TAoSC loses much of its effectiveness (and readability) by treating modernity as the apocalypse. All we're left with is a preservationist's anguished denunciation of everything that's changed.There's a wonderful quote from English author Douglas Adams that covers this terrain better than anything I can add: “1. Anything that is in the world when you’re born is normal and ordinary and is just a natural part of the way the world works.2. Anything that's invented between when you’re fifteen and thirty-five is new and exciting and revolutionary and you can probably get a career in it.3. Anything invented after you're thirty-five is against the natural order of things.”"
12,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/679134-bryan-alexander,4,"We read this for our online book club in the spring and summer of 2019.Here are our discussions by chapter: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, and 18.My concluding thoughts?Generally Zuboff succeeds in sketching out a dystopian business model, one predicated on turning the details of our lives into corporate profit.  This is most famously or notoriously demonstrated by Facebook and Google.  The structures and strategies Surveillance Capitalism lays out are very useful tools, like the kidnap/corner/compete playbook.Zuboff gives us new ways to think about the digital world in 2019, drawing out an archaeology of its development and pushing back on current understanding.  In one neat move, for example, she takes issue with the famous “you are not the consumer; you are the product” axiom.  Instead, Zuboff would rather we think thusly: “we are the sources of raw-material supply.” (69-70)The book is mostly analytical, a wide-ranging and deeply probing exploration of the business model.  Developing a solution to surveillance capitalism is a secondary consideration, and not a very inspiring one.  Zuboff has some hopes for creative and popular resistance, and ultimately sees governmental regulation as the best option.  I'm not sure that this is convincing.To begin with, as Zuboff acknowledges, governments often engage in surveillance that is arguably more terrifying than Facebooks, as they are backed up with laws and armed might.  Many governments also practice the nudging Surveillance Capitalism decries.  Yes, states can and often do two opposing things at the same time, but the tension should be addressed.  Otherwise the argument runs the risk of asking us to appeal to bullies for protection.Moreover, the politics involved can become challenging, especially in the United States.  This month several Democratic presidential candidates are going after some of Silicon Valley; regulating tech firms could become an epically partisan issue, especially for a Republican party keen to protect and extend big business.  On the other hand, some Republicans, including Trump, are incensed at what they see as FAANG's anti-conservative bias.   The Trump administration is also weighing regulatory options against the digital giants.  A leading conservative blogger called for antitrust action. Is a bipartisan consensus possible?Put another way, can Congress escape Silicon Valley's lobbying might, or will it be sufficiently captured to not enact anything meaningful?  Further, if Evgeny Morozov is right, as Barbara Fister suggests, and surveillance capitalism is really about capitalism itself, what kind of political organization is available now to respond? Perhaps thee bipartisan possibility I noted above will fall apart as a socialism-interested left wing feuds with Republicans and centrist Democrats alike.   Or, if surveillance capitalism is about extraction, as Zuboff insists, is a better model anti-colonialism, as Vanessa Vaile suggests?  That could lead to an international politics, whereby some other nations oppose Silicon Valley for fomenting an updated, digital colonialism.Or should we think about this instead as a health care issue, since so many of the privacy  violations Zuboff abhors occur in the body of mind?  If so,  the odds aren't good, as Noel De Martin observes.  Indeed, surveillance capitalism may have succeeded in implanting itself too deeply in our psyches to be uprooted, as Mark Spradley ponders.Furthermore, the book notes several times that the surveillance capitalism model doesn't stem entirely from the technology sector.  Indeed, the financial sector played a key role in shaping and driving it (cf Mark Corbett Wilson's fine comment).  That sector is enormously powerful, both economically and politically.  How can a society and culture oppose its strategy?  Arguably America failed to do so after the 2008 financial disaster (recall Occupy).  Again, political challenges and complexity are rampant on this score.Shifting from politics to economics, Zuboff would like us to support alternative funding models.  What are they?  Barbara Fister identifies DuckDuckGo and paid(walled) journalism. Noel De Martin points to Netflix as one where we pay for content - although it's really a hybrid model, as Netflix mines our viewing habits to surface recommendations.Can other businesses compete by openly resisting surveillance capitalism?  Carl Rosenfeld thinks this might be happening with VPN providers.  Apple has lately made a play for being taken seriously as a pro-privacy actor. Alan Baily notes that Apple makes hardware and might be too far behind Google etc. to catch up.  Perhaps their alleged shift to being a media company will lead them to follow Netflix's hybrid path.  The computer gaming industry - immense and weirdly absent from Zuboff's book - largely sells artifacts and services without managing to stalk our inner data-thoughts (except through canny design); Steam is not great at recommendations.On a different register, I think Age of Surveillance Capitalism fails to understand why so many consumers volunteer to enter the universe of decreased, monetized privacy.  The book compares this business model to military conquest, but doesn't account well for our conscious embrace of it.  As Ken Soto points out, low- or no-cost services of high quality are quite appealing to consumers.  Think of how Gmail outcompeted email clients, or how Facebook crafted a better social experience than Facebook.  Google Earth, Google Books: these are effective tools without serious competition.  As Nicholas Carr argues (and it's not often I agree with him),While Zuboff’s assessment of the costs that people incur under surveillance capitalism is exhaustive, she largely ignores the benefits people receive in return — convenience, customization, savings, entertainment, social connection, and so on. The benefits can’t be dismissed as illusory, and the public can no longer claim ignorance about what’s sacrificed in exchange for them.I admit to being torn on this in my personal experience.  Despite my dread of their datamining, Amazon's recommendation system is better than the suggestions I'll get from 99% of bookstores.   I use many Google tools (Drive, Gmail, Maps, etc) because the price is good and the quality high.  Facebook still gives me a bigger social network than any other platform, no matter how badly Zuckerberg behaves.  Voice activated tools are handy for me when I'm cooking or driving.  Convenience and quality are powerful forces and help enable the age of surveillance capitalism; the titular book needs to account for them, even though that would weaken its rhetorical stance.Beyond myself, I think the personal experience of many other people helps explain why Facebook, Google et al can get away with this.  You see, Zuboff posits an opposition between a good life with privacy and the bad life after social media, yet that duality doesn't withstand scrutiny.  Before Web 2.0 many people already lived with many privacy violations.  The world of work can compromise privacy in a variety of ways, from surveilled email to intense bodily scrutiny; actually, as Katie Fitzpatrick points out, Zuboff seems more concerned with leisure than work.  The war on (some) drugs has habituated many Americans to yielded up our bodily fluids to bureaucratic processing.  The many people who serve in or work closely with the military have a very different privacy experience than the ideal one Zuboff holds out.  In fact, the war on terror has systematically degraded American civil liberties.  Even without war, many who would access some public services are long used to opening up their lives to the gaze of civil servants.  Next to any of these, letting Google trawl one's email to shape some small ads is far less threatening.  If I can slightly misread Blayne Haggart, the book overstates its claims to novelty.Where does this leave us?The Age of Surveillance Capitalism is a powerful book that should be read.  It does feel incomplete, however, like a business book that falls short of politics, or one crafted with a Manichean zeal that misses the nuances of history and daily life.  I recommend it for its utility and the conversations it should start.Looking ahead, I think Zuboff outlines an unfolding politics.  We should pursue that thinking.(And many thanks, once more, to the readers in our online book club.)"
13,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3844934-paul,1,"The reviews of this book were very positive and the blurb suggested it was just the book I was looking to read. ""...as surveillance capitalism advances from Silicon Valley into every sector of the global economy, she brings its consequences to life"".Unfortunately she doesn't. Over almost 700 pages (including 140 pages of footnotes to highlight the amount of research that has gone into this book) we do not get to see the consequences of living with the always on devices in our homes, on our wrists, in our cars of our modern world. You feel a critique of Facebook, Google, Amazon, etc data gathering techniques and how they use them would be like shooting fish in a barrel, but repeatedly she misses the target. We get more a history of behavioural psychology, and endless flashbacks to comparisons to Ford's production lines. The language is full of jargon, neologisms and is endlessly circular. There are a few interesting insights hidden in there, such as the Chinese model of collecting personal data on millions of people and using it to affect life chances and advancement, but this is dismissed as unworkable, and ""the Chinese are used to being observed anyway"". There seems no curiosity about how much our western governments are doing the same thing to profile their citizens. The repeatedly examined catchy examples are of Pokemon-Go directing players to businesses and an automated vacuum cleaner secretly mapping your rooms. Little mention of surveillance capitalism's more sinister uses in having always on microphones in millions of households. Also Edward Snowden and Cambridge Analytica's exposés of big data's political uses, eg in trying to swing elections and referendums gets barely a mention.The conclusion feels like a good introduction, summing up what we already know, but that is the point we get to by the end of the book. There feels like a naivety in the author, who has just suddenly realised that our actions, decisions, routes we take and private conversations are being catalogued. She talks about the teenagers being in the vanguard of those observed by Facebook (I would suggest teenagers are elsewhere whilst Facebook's biggest audience are aged 20-40), and other slightly wrong mentions about how technology is used and accepted into the day to day lives of many people, who know they are being watched, but don't care. This book fails to let us know why we should care. I honestly think most newspaper reviewers read the intro, looked at the chapter titles and then read the conclusion, not noticing that there is little new in between."
14,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12162514-graeme-newell,2,"I found the topic of this book really fascinating. I’m so anxious to better understand how the tech giants like Google, Amazon and Facebook gather and use the vast amounts of data they collect. Unfortunately this book was a swing and a miss. The author is so passionately obsessed with vilifying these companies that the book regressed to a 700+ page vendetta. It’s obvious she did some amazing research but the portent of doom that pervades this book just got too annoying. Okay, I get it. These companies are invading our privacy. Can we get to the information now? The book starts with a mind-numbing 50 page tirade on how evil she thinks these companies have become. Why can’t she just let me make up my own mind after hearing the facts? She also has the annoying tendency of continually wandering into the weeds. She’ll just get going on the story of how a tech giant uses information and then suddenly we’re whisked off to 16th century Europe, or for some reason we’re discussing Homer. All of this is a vain attempt to make some tangential metaphorical point.I gave up on this book after 100 pages. Too bad. It’s a captivating topic. I know there is a lot of good insight buried somewhere inside this tome. I just wish someone with more focus and less of a score to settle had written this book."
15,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33921897-kusaimamekirai,5," Who knows? Who decides? Who decides who decides? I remember thinking a few years back, when Siri was introduced to Apple iPhones, “why exactly do we need this?”. Had it really become such an inconvenience to type a few words into our ubiquitous phones to get information? Who was clamoring for this?  Today Siri seems almost quaint. We’ve moved at the speed of light to voice recognition finding a restaurant for us to “smart homes” that play our music, regulate temperatures, adjust our mattresses, and (in theory at least) keep us safe from the outside world. These technologies have infiltrated our lives with such speed that they seem like they have always been here and to question their place in our lives seems almost like heresy. Any thought of a world without them seems antiquated and inconvenient. It is the future and everyone knows the future is inevitable. Or is it? Shoshana Zuboff’s “The Age of Surveillance Capitalism” asks just that question. Just how inevitable are these seemingly relentless incursions into our private lives? More importantly, at what cost do we allow them in? One of the main problems necessary to overcome before answering these questions however is distinguishing between technology and what Zuboff calls “surveillance capitalism”. The former is in and of itself neutral. It’s effect on society is entirely at the mercy of how it is used. It has no intrinsic morality. In contrast, “surveillance capitalism” is quite different:“Surveillance capitalism is not technology; it is a logic that imbues technology and commands it into action….That surveillance capitalism is a logic in action and not a technology is a vital point because surveillance capitalists want us to think that their practices are inevitable expressions of the technologies they employ….We cannot evaluate the current trajectory of information civilization without a clear appreciation that technology is not and never can be a thing in itself, isolated from economics and society. This means that technological inevitability does not exist. Technologies are always economic means, not ends in themselves"" “Surveillance capitalism” seeks to monetize the routines of our daily lives through collecting excruciatingly minute data about our every interaction and use it to modify our behavior and herd us toward a particular financial outcome. That emoji you posted on Facebook? That time you got angry at a friend on your Android? That video chat where you shifted uncomfortably in your chair? All logged and crunched into an extensive data profile that insurance companies can use to determine the cost of your policy, banks can use to determine if you’re a credit risk, and in China to determine if you are eligible for certain kinds of employment. This is not simply a digital footprint of websites you’ve visited where you can clear your history and move on. What companies like Facebook and Google are doing know is a radical reshaping of societies around the world. Consider:“In addition to Facebook’s already complex computational machinery for targeting ads, by 2016 the News Feed function depended upon one of the world’s most secretive predictive algorithms, derived from a God view of more than 100,000 elements of behavioral surplus that are continuously computed to determine the’personal relevancy’ score of thousands of possible posts as it scans and collects everything posted in the past week by each of your friends, everyone you follow, each group you belong to, and every Facebook page you’ve liked.” This is being done for financial gain to be sure (Pokemon Go directing players to paying advertisers or insurance companies purchasing customer profiles and shutting down cars remotely with drivers who they judge to be at risk) but more importantly it is shaping how we behave. As Zuboff writes, surveillance capitalists despise and seek to alleviate “friction”. Friction here meaning the unpredictability of human beings and their purchasing habits. It is no longer enough to simply hope they will want to by a particular product, we can now manipulate people toward desired outcomes based on their emotions and life patterns. It is truly terrifying and yet there is seemingly little outrage about this fundamental altering of who we are as human beings. Zuboff argues that this is in part due not only to the false feeling of inevitability these companies assure us of, but also due to the unprecedented nature of what is happening. As Zuboff writes:""In contrast, surveillance capitalism is a new actor in history, both original and sui generis. It is of its own kind and unlike anything else: a distinct new planet with its own physics of time and space, its sixty-seven-hour days, emerald sky, inverted mountain ranges, and dry water."" When contesting something that is familiar, we combat it with methods that are also familiar. Methods that have been tried, tested, and effective. However the unprecedented nature of surveillance capitalism upends all of that. Using existing law to legally restrain them takes years, during which time the incursions being resisted have either morphed into something totally different or have become such a habitual part of our lives to the point that we forget just what it was we were fighting. Zuboff calls this stage, habituation:“Whereas lawsuits and investigations unwind at the tedious pace of democratic institutions, Google continues the development of its contested practices at high velocity. During the elapsed time of FTC and FCC inquiries, court cases, judicial reviews, and EU Commission investigations, the new contested practices become more firmly established as institutional facts, rapidly bolstered by growing ecosystems of stakeholders. People habituate to the incursion with some combination of agreement, helplessness, and resignation. The sense of astonishment and outrage dissipates. The incursion itself, once unthinkable, slowly worms its way into the ordinary. Worse still, it gradually comes to seem inevitable. New dependencies develop. As populations grow numb, it becomes more difficult for individuals and groups to complain.” With surveillance capitalism moving at light speed, new methods of combatting it that move equally quickly must be used.  Particularly considering that surveillance capitalism, aware of the existential danger to its existence, is deeply imbedded in the governments in charge of regulating it. Consider the case of Google: “By April 2016, 197 individuals had migrated from the government into the Googlesphere, and 61 had moved in the other direction. Among these, 22 White House officials went to work for Google, and 31 Googlesphere executives joined the White House or federal advisory boards with direct relevance to Google’s business.” With tech companies firmly pitting a finger on the scale of regulation, a new way of controlling them is vital. Since we are increasingly not given a choice as to whether we assent to relinquishing the details of our personal lives, we must raise our voices and demand that choice. As surveillance capitalism creeps further and further into every facet of our lives, obliterating the concept of privacy while labeling it as being outdated, we must reclaim out humanity from their tyranny."

You know how I love secrecy. It is the only thing that can make modern life wonderful or mysterious to us. The commonest thing is delightful if one only hides it.Oscar Wilde, The Picture of Dorian GrayThis is a book of extraordinary erudition and intelligence. She identifies the problem but also, where it is all leading, and why we are blithely going along with it. Arendt, Kafka, Rousseau, Paine, Piketty and many others are marshalled to her cause.So - in short, googlefacebookmicrosoftamazonverizon are making oodles of money from targeted ads, based on predictions of our behaviour which in turn are based on our activity online. Yeah yeah yeah, you say, we know this. Fine. But she goes further - their ultimate goal is not to stop at predicting our behaviour but shaping it. Cambridge Analytica, the targeted fake news aimed at influencing voting, was only the tip of the iceberg. The promise of the promise and the will to will run deeper than these deformities. They remind us of that place again where we humans heal the breach between the known and the unknowable, navigating the seas of uncertainty in our vessels of shared promises. In the real world of human endeavour there is no perfect information and no perfect rationality. Life inclines us to take action and to make commitments even when the future is unknown. Anyone who has brought a child into the world or has otherwise given her or his heart in love knows this to be true. God knows the future, but we move forward, take risks, and bind ourselves to others despite the fact that we can’t know everything about the present let alone the future. This is the essence of our freedom, expressed as the element right to the future tense. With the construction and ownership of the new means of behavioural modification, the fate of this right conforms to a pattern that we have already identified. Is it not extinguished but rather it is usurped, commandeered and accumulated by surveillance capital’s exclusive claims on our futures. (Ch. 11.2: We Will to Will)As you can see she invents a new language to talk about this stuff. Don't be put off.

What we are living through is a brand new kind of technology, and a brand new kind of business built on and for that. It astoundingly hard to grasp the nature of a paradigm shift while it is happening. Shoshanna Zuboff puts it all together into a single book: the history, the discovery, the development, from the Google taking the responsibility to find the right place to put the ad, to predicting behavior from digital exhaust, to the surprising technique of guaranteed outcomes.You already know that as users of Google search, we are not the customer. But we are not the product either. We are merely the source of something else: behavioral surplus. Google, and Facebook, and Amazon vacuum up that surplus which consists of old search queries, logs of mouse clicks, records of sites visited, and most importantly: ""like"" button clicks. None of this is of any value to us, but when aggregated it can tell a powerful story about each and every one of us. That behavioral surplus can be used to predict what we will do. If it was only prediction it would not be a particular problem. But this is where it turns dark: if you have a model that can predict what a person will do, then you can use that model to make people do things.Our democracy and capitalism is built on the idea of a free market. Adam Smith described the ""invisible hand"" of the market, that while millions of people made independent decisions for our own personal welfare, the market was structured to find a nearly optimal distribution of goods ans services. The hand is invisible because it was impossible to know everything the everyone was doing. The aggregate behavior of all people was unknowable.Until now.Google and Facebook have detailed profiles on most of the people in the country: some thorough and some not, but it is all getting much more complete as new devices emit ever more digital exhaust to be collected. It is surveillance-as-a-service. We can be quite sure the 2016 Brexit vote and the Trump victory were due in no small part to manipulation with the tools of surveillance capitalism. What happens to democracy when a company can sell guaranteed outcomes for a price? What happens to the free market when the invisible hand disappears and is replaced by plutocrats who simply manipulate the public will to their favor?We don't know the answers to these questions, and Zuboff doesn't either. It is too new. It is all just forming. Most of our legislators have only the faintest grasp of what is going on, much less what to do about it. But this is clearly the most important development of our time. If you want to understand it, this book is a monumental resource: well organized, well researched, well written.This is a timely book, not too soon, and not too late. On a five-star scale, I am giving it a six. It is that important.Wait ... we have had mass propaganda before that persuaded people and in some sense controlled them. Why is it any different this time? The difference is that through the collection of behavioral surplus, a very detailed model of every citizen can be constructed. From this model, algorithms can fashion a detailed plan for exactly what to display unique to each person. But it does not stop there: your behavior is further monitored to see which things you reacted to and which you didn't. This is used to further tune the model. Advertisements, memes, opinions, political statements, images are all thrust into the sidebars of the web pages. No two people get the exact same mix. Your response on every one can be captured and categorized independently. There has never in history been the ability to customize propaganda campaigns for individuals and be able to measure exactly how each individual responds. We have no precedence for this, and we have no idea where it is going or even how to change course if we see something amiss. Zuboff gives us detailed example after example of how this came about, how it is being used, and what the legal implications are. Even Roger McNamee who has just published a similarly themed book called ""Zucked"" admits that the big difference is that Zuboff has all the data. She compare this emergence to that of Totalitarianism just 100 years ago. Totalitarianism enveloped the individual in a state-wide system of total control. We are not to fear that this is all going toward totalitarianism -- that was last time, and this time is different. She coins the term ""Instrumentarianism"" to describe the way that unknown algorithms are at the root of collecting the data, building the models, and crafting the plan of persuasion. I guarantee in the next 5 to 10 years, you will be hearing a lot about Surveillance Capitalism and Instrumentarianism. We will need these new terms, and many other presented concepts just to understand what is happening. Only then, can we hope to navigate these stormy seas to the (hopefully) safe harbor once we know how to tame this new beast."
19,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67922894-gary-barnes,2,"Ms Zuboff has a number of outstanding points to make in this weighty tome. Unfortunately she seems to have attempted to do it in Klingon. A 250 page book without the repetitive, dense, unnecessarily high-flown prose would have been perfectly okay. Now this book will go down as a laborious, soul destroying pile of paper. 5 stars for the content, deduct three stars for the writing style."

21,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16848916-sasha-mircov,4,"The Age of Surveillance Capitalism is a very welcome and overdue attempt to provide a theory and critique of the information economy. Professor Soshana Zuboff does a great job of the former but the absolute and inescapable apocalypse her theory predicts is unconvincing. The two main concepts in Zuboff’s book are “surveillance capitalism” and “instrumentarian power” or, in less charged terms, the information economy and knowledge as power. In the spirit of some of the most prominent social theorists of the last century, such as Adorno, Arent, Weber, Marx and Foucault, Zuboff provides a coherent picture of the inner workings of big tech behind the information economy, notably Google and Facebook. She eloquently explains the effect of the quantified and all-connected world in which big tech is harvesting our ""digital behavioral surplus"" for profit, often without our informed and explicit consent. Zuboff’s prowess as a business professor shines through as she breaks down big tech’s business practices. From the business model of Google AdWords and Sheryl Sandberg’s influence to Google's lobbying strategies and Facebook's constant experimentation, the author gets it all right. She even ties it all together with the Internet of Things and The Fourth Industrial Revolution. As masterful as it is, the book is not without its shortfalls and deficiencies. The economic impact of the surveillance economy is barely discussed. In 2017, Google alone generated around $238B in economic activity. Google and Facebook are often the best-performing advertising platforms for millions of small and medium-size businesses. Another noticeable no-show in Zuboff's book is Amazon, perhaps because of its association with the concept of ""advocacy capitalism"" - a more favorable form of capitalism as described in Zuboff’s previous book, The Support Economy. The least convincing part of Zuboff’s most recent book is around what is at stake - our humanity, our freedom and even our free will. Free will, a finicky and controversial philosophical concept, is mutated into its meta-version, a will to will, which is the prerequisite for freedom and ultimately what defines us as humans. And it is precisely the ability to envision a future for ourselves that the “instrumentarian power” through “surveillance capitalism” is stealing away from us. Zuboff is not wrong. People are complex, dynamic systems and the very attempt to predict one’s future behavior can trigger adaptation. The information economy, mediated by prediction algorithms, does precisely that - it changes us. However, to fear the change because it will strip us of our free will leaves her worries hanging on a shaky nail. Zuboff is careful not to get entangled in the metaphysics of free will, leaving those inclined to question the concept with unanswered questions. Finally, for the 700 plus pages long polemic, the book is noticeably short of solutions. Zuboff acknowledges that regulation, such as the EU privacy regulation GDPR, are steps in the right direction and praises artists making clothing that can trick the image recognition software deployed by the surveillance capitalists. On a philosophical level, she calls for the development of synthetic declaration on surveillance capitalism ""to define and support other variants of information capitalism that participate in the social order, value people, and reflect democratic principles"". Blockchain, the one technology that sprung out of the need for privacy, is part of the problem according to Zuboff, especially smart contracts, or ""the anti-contracts"", as she calls them.In spite of the flaws, The Age of Surveillance Capitalism should be required reading for those who work in or with information technology. After all, what Professor Zuboff is doing in the book is predicting the future. And, in the same way Facebook's prediction and recommendation algorithms are slowly changing us, so will this book, but hopefully in the opposite direction."
22,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11407801-dramatika,4,"I read about this book in one of the Telegram channels, my only enjoyable source of the good news feed (not feel good news, just smth a little bit different and less mainstream) at the moment. I agree with the channel author (@hobbes_channel) that this book is as important as Capital by Thomas Piketty, and (I might add) flawed in many similar ways as well. This is a serious study on the ever changing world that we live now. I seem to experience a certain never ending feeling of doom and gloom ( if you live in Russia, this is more likely to be a semi permanent state for anyone with a conscience). The books I read lately reflect this all too well. This particular one is different in a sudden revelation how (once again) we came to live in completely new world order, where everything we took for granted and even guaranteed before now all in the past, a rare luxury available to a very few or none at all. Personal privacy is gone forever. I wouldn't repeat all the aspects of our life that are affected, you read it very well researched and excellently presented in this book. It is a not an enjoyable reading, unless you like horror or disaster genre, just prepare to lose a few night of sleep over the content it is that earth shattering in its scope and detail! For me it was just right up there continuing the beat of existential angst that is this life. The book is flawed in being too long and detailed in its research, (but less technical and more reader friendly than Piketty Talmud which I managed to fall asleep over many nights). Still I encouraged to read it in its entirety to understand step by step how we lost this battle of undeclared war over out own person hood of who we are as sentinel being. What I feel would be interesting add to this wonderful book is to show more how we still try to fight this war more. Deep web, vpn, migration to the unsmart simple phones (yes I knew a few ppl like that."

I decided to know what was behind the curtain and I am not sure I am happier now. This book unveils just how intrusive the big tech companies have been in our lives, mainly without our permission and without notifying us exactly what they were doing with the information. Google, Facebook, and others are directing our behavior even when we think we are choosing. Did you know know that it was proven in court that the Google Street View cars were capturing all our i.p addresses and other information as they drive by our homes? Zuck has spoken publically that the public doesn't care about privacy any more so FB doesn't really ask permission to steal your data and sell it for profit to other vendors without our knowing. The book was good but was way toooooooooooo long. I can't say I enjoyed it but I was enlightened."

25,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17999985-brendan,5,"5Big data is a word you'll see constantly hitting the media and non fiction sections of your favourite shop, and as the technology grows, so will the capabilities of big data. The Age of Surveillance Capitalism by Shoshana Zuboff has come out at exactly the right moment, and it should be on your to-read list. This book is a thorough understanding of what is happening, much that isn't televised, or published by journalists. The gateway to our privacy has been open and it's not designed for our benefit. This book is a must read for the next decade, very relevant and informative. This book is tough work. Every page is information and it will test your patience. I do understand the low scores, but they don't reflect the truth about this book. It's an essential read for anyone with children, or is living in a world of ignorance. I will admit I knew big data before it was coined big data, but what the author has created is a bible of information on the biggest data companies in the world. Our information and digital imprint is going to be worth everything in this capitalistic world. This next decade is going to be interesting as AI and technology growth is outgrowing our laws and institutions. We're not protected, and this is where the book vividly demonstrates it's not a great thing. Shoshana Zuboff has done a lot of homework and I didn't rush this book like many others. I wanted to learn exactly what is going on, and it's quite scary. Consider the latest controversy with Facebook dialling in on the younger generations and twisting people's opinions for political means. I tend to think of the late bloomers with technology to be the luckiest. The chapters here are full of referencing and the research references are 200 pages. The author is passionate and if you're lucky enough to have taken the leap into the rabbit hole, finding that exit is going to be tough. Why the 5?Strong book. The author deliveries a book for the decade and it's a lot of information to process. This is a one time deal and I would recommend reading this, and maybe checking out some of the reference books or articles. Big data is allowing our lives to be penetrated by capitalism, and they essentially know you better than you know your self. They can predict what you want to buy, or predict patterns via GPS. Telecommunication and internet providers collect the data, Microsoft, Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple are all collecting every bit of data they can. The customers of this data are not out to help you. The people buying your data are insurance companies and big business, capitalism on steroids. Imagine you drive over the speed limit because they collect the data and your GPS coordinates, and the police units just send you an email/letter for the fine. You sign up for fitness apps and the health insurance people decide to increase your premiums due to the fact you eat, or don't exercise enough. This is the future of big data. They will tell you they are doing it to improve their service, but why sell the data to corporations?There's an issue growing here and it's outgrowing our comfort zone, e.g. country laws. They are essentially using all the data against us for financial purposes, and the worst thing is that these companies are pushing technology boundaries. Imagine you buy a product and think I don't have to link it to anything. They won't allow you to upgrade functions, or patch tech issues if you don't allow them. There's a growing issue here and that's why I recommend this book for the next decade relevance. This is information overload, but worth the time. "
26,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58564-joshua,4,"As one might guess from the title, this book takes the dimmest possible view of the tech industry as currently constructed. It's a compelling and useful case, even if it overindulges in its own academic jargon and seems at time weirdly unaware of the industry is it comparing to the 21st century version of totalitarianism. Early in the book, Zuboff makes the important point that surveillance capitalism is not technology, but a business model. It requires technology to exist, but technology doesn't need surveillance capitalism. Instead, Google and Facebook found out that they could harvest ""behavioral surplus"" -- information that the use of their products created -- and turn it into a wholly new form of currency. Soon the entire economy followed in their footsteps, until today we are required to subject ourselves to commercial surveillance as a part of any economic interaction. ""The very idea of a functional, effective, affordable product or service as a sufficient basis for economy exchange is dying,"" as she writes. Zuboff notes that many eras of capitalism have been built on the discovery of an un-mined form of raw material that can be claimed at no cost and built into enormous empires. European imperialists sailed across the sea and claimed land without having to pay for it. Tech companies figured out ways to collect proprietary troves of personal data. Zuboff doesn't really bother even to frame this in the usual way, as an exchange, where users receive useful services in exchange for sharing this data. In her mind, any gains are so small they're not worth mentioning in comparison to what has been given up. If she glosses over the benefits of tech platforms, Zuboff also can get a bit carried away with downsides. The book suffers from her inability to pick the best examples to make her main point, which is that the collection of personal data leads to irresistible behavior modification and the loss of autonomy. One of Zuboff's two main illustrations is Pokemon Go, a fad from a few years back. She then attacks it with ominous and dense academic prose. Here she is describing how the ability of businesses to pay to promote their locations in the game is dystopian mind-control. ""The game had demonstrated that it was possible to achieve economies of action on a global scale while simultaneously directing specific individual actions towards precise local market opportunities where high bidders enjoy an ever-closer approximation of guaranteed outcomes."" Pokemon Go is not dystopian mind-control. But YouTube and Facebook may be! Yet Zuboff doesn't even seem aware of how content recommendation algorithms drive people towards conspiracy theories and extreme content because the computers learn that this is what keep people engaged with the content for the longest. This is totally what she's talking about when she goes about ""radical indifference"" -- the tendency of tech platforms to control people's behavior without caring what they're actually doing. These shortcomings are frustrating given that 1) this is a long-ass book, and 2) a lot of what she's getting at has real merit. Wading through the book's excesses is worth it, though, because the framework of a really scary argument is all here. Among Zuboff's many analogies, the one that lingered with me what her comparison of surveillance capitalism to industrial capitalism. In industrial capitalism, great economic fortunes were made at the expense of fundamental damage to the environment. With surveillance capitalism, the pollution is damaging human nature instead."
27,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3663809-alex-orr,1,"This is so poorly written, so horrendously edited (was it edited?), and so stupefyingly redundant that it's really hard to adequately capture in words. You really have to slog through it yourself to understand the depths of its faults. So, let me save you the frustration. The author basically is saying that the aim of much of our current cutting edge technology is to gather as much data about us as possible through everything from smart homes, smart cars, and (obviously) social media in order to construct a perfect simulacrum of ourselves in order to not just sell us more stuff, but to mold our behaviors...nay...our whole lives...as the companies deploying this tech see fit. That's about it. This book is a Ted Talk gone off the rails in the hands of an author who never met an ancillary idea she didn't want to include, and who really, really, REALLY loves to restate her hypotheses over, and over, and over... In the third part of the book, she literally devotes a whole chapter to summarizing the previous chapter. Every second or third paragraph exists solely to restate the preceeding paragraphs. Whole paragraphs exist only to lay out what she will tell us in the proceeding paragraphs and then later (you guessed it) she devotes whole paragraphs to summarizing the previous paragraphs. As for her central ideas? Ehhh.... Look, if you're aware of this book then you're already well aware of her central ideas because they're some of the most commonly discussed and hotly debated in the realms of big data, online privacy, and the growing sway Silicon Valley holds over our lives. The people who are unaware of these issues really could use a shorter, tighter, and just plain easier to read book to perhaps wake them up. The biggest problem I found (other than this being an atrociously written and edited book) is the author's extreme confidence in her beliefs of how this is all going to play out. By the end of the book she is talking of a near-future defined by a sort of techno-fascism in which the individual self has been exterminated from the world. Subtlety is not in her intellectual toolkit. If you decide to tackle this massive misfire at least take come comfort in knowing that it gets easier to read because you become far more comfortable skimming dozens of pages in a matter of seconds since most of it is usually just stuff she said earlier in the book that is repeated, often identically, for no other reason than...well...I don't know. This book reads like a wild and wooly first draft, not like a thoughtful, streamlined, well laid out, final version."
28,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1368664-loafingcactus,3,"Normally I wouldn't be so bold as to review a book I had read only partially, but looking over the other reviews available so far I am emboldened. I only had this massive book available to me for a short time, so I read the conclusion, which would stand alone as a pamphlet.The conclusion is basically Ellul's The Technological Society (another massive, and very worthwhile, book), albeit with the course of history narrowed and Ellul's supernatural solution replaced by a humanistic one. I find both authors' solutions unlikely, and Zuboff's has the added problem of arguing that surveillance capitalism is not the same thing as industrial capitalism and then arguing that the same (questionably effective) solutions to make it humane will work. Why would that be?Ellul would disagree that surveillance capitalism is in any way different from industrial capitalism. Rather, the logic of the one flows into the other and the other was completely predictable (he predicted it in his book).As far as I can tell no individual can swim against this tide, and changing the direction of the sea in which we live would require disrupting the entire logic of social organization, democratic or otherwise, that has existed for all time. I doubt that can be done without massive human destruction. I think it will be done, in this age of the Anthropocene, by the massive human destruction that will flow inevitably from environmental destruction, but that is not the outcome that either Ellul or Zuboff were looking for (though Zuboff makes a nod to it as a co-equal problem)."

33,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5874435-manu,4,"Around the same time last year, I remember tweeting a quote attributed to Jamie Bartlett - ""The end result will be ad targeting so effective that you may well question the notion of free will altogether"". Connecting digital advertising to free will seems absurd, but it wasn't a facetious remark. It reflected the reality of our times. This is the reality that Shoshana Zuboff explores and confronts in The Age of Surveillance Capitalism, frequently echoing the thought that keeps cropping up in my mind - how did we get here? She begins with a deeply personal story about her home, and brings up an ""aware home"" project in 2000, which among other things, assumed that the rights to the knowledge would lie in the hands of the human living in it. She then juxtaposes it against the current privacy policy and usage agreements of Google's Nest, which all but completely gives the ownership to the search giant. This is just one example. Industrial capitalism thrived by exploiting nature, and surveillance capitalism is thriving by using human nature as a resource. That means that even though, due to rapid industrialisation and mass production, we got to a ""second modernity"" that provided millions access to experiences which were until then the preserve of a smaller elite, we are now being led back into a ""neofeudalism"", a consolidation of elite wealth and power. How did this happen?Google plays the primary antagonist in this narrative, and though Brin and Page were initially reluctant, the 2000 bust set Google on a path that used the ""behavioural surplus"" generated by users. At a basic level, it is probably difficult to imagine that when one carries out a search on Google, the machine is searching for patterns in the expressed intent, and making rapid incursions into one's life. And yet, that's exactly how it works. It then leads to prediction products, economies of action and future behaviour markets, fuelled by an ever expanding scope of information extraction. Those ridiculous permissions apps require make sense now? And how does a corporation create and grow a future behaviour market? Simple, behaviour modification, whether you realise it or not. Over a period of time, Google has institutionalised its invasions into private human domains, helped in the beginning by the national security imperative following the 9/11 attacks. Chrome, GMail, Android, Photos, YouTube and so on have created a dependency that now borders on feeling left out of the societal narrative if one is not using these. The behind-the-scenes look at Pokémon Go is chilling - in terms of how users were giving away data of their own volition, how partners were brought on board to expand the scope of surveillance, and how human behaviour was controlled at global scale. Facebook makes its presence felt in the latter half of the book, thanks to its exploitation of social connections. By creating a prototype of a hive mind through the weaponisation of peer group reinforcement, it increasingly shapes minds and behaviour, especially that of young adults. The author uses Goffman's framing in The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life and shows how the ""backstage"", where individuals are truly themselves, is now shrinking thanks to the omnipresence of social incursions. Where does this lead to? One example is when the state starts using this power - China's social credit system now has a direct impact on an individual's life, driving economies of action in the real world. More broadly, totalitarianism, driven by powerful corporations. The consequences are that there is increasingly no refuge, no sanctuary, from the relentless efforts of corporations that are intent on controlling every facet of an individual's existence. At a broader level, it threatens the fabric of society and democracy itself. Capitalism's latest avatar has clearly gone rogue, refusing to abide by the reciprocal nature of every kind of interaction we have experienced thus far. Regulation isn't really keeping up, except for some efforts by the EU. But there are those who refuse to give up - activists, and artists who use technology to keep out surveillance. However, this is a fight we have to contribute to, because what's at stake is what makes us human - free will, or at least the notion of it. This is not an easy read, but it is a must-read!"
34,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5229510-scott-shjefte,3,"The concept presented is not simple and is made more difficult by the author. It is logical diverse in the presentation of ideas. This book is textually extremely difficult both in lexical difficulty and in syntactical difficulty. Also while in the misty fog of presentation you really don't know where the author intended to go until you reanalyze what you just read then you have to figure out the logic/truthfulness of what was presented followed by integrating it into the whole of the chapter/book. Basically what I got out of the book is that we consumer human beings are losing our freedom of choice and loss of our ability to self-determination by our being totally analyzed by a 'comprehensive intelligence databases' that can be used to trigger our behavior to do what companies, unknown agents, or even governments want. There is a lot of examples referenced with a slew of people quoted. Textual difficulty means how easy or hard a text is to read.

35,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11651139-john,3,"Whoof. I need time to put my opinions in order. This is a zeroth draft.I work at Google. This book is a direct attack on Google and Facebook and the industry they enable. So it covers topics I have thought about, and also felt like a personal attack, which I resented and had to repeatedly take a step back to listen to.My feeling is: to somebody who hasn't thought about the impact of modern internet systems on privacy, this is a critical eye-opener. Do not imagine your privacy doesn't matter; do not imagine the authorities will never target you because they have bigger fish to fry. The way surveillance -- and I'm thinking about the NSA here, but it works for internet companies -- works is that data is amassed ahead of time into a giant ""data lake,"" and then analyses are run over it. So if your data is being collected, it is going into the machine, and you do need to reason about how that might hurt you.To someone who has thought about privacy, this book is annoyingly naïve, in that ""shit-colored goggles"" way. That means that one the surface, it is so grim you assume it's sophisticated -- but it's actually naïve because it phrases everything in terms of an entity who wants to do you harm, but giving that entity a motive is a cop-out. The reality is much scarier: well-intentioned people, who from my experience may even have utopian motives and beliefs, are amassing data that they are going to their wits ends to protect against unauthorized access; and they exist in an environment in which the criticality of that privacy is paramount, and thus they feel safe amassing the data under those restrictions. But the data is still being amassed, and data is like toxic waste; the very fact that it exists creates a permanent risk. One risk is unauthorized third party access; another risk is that someday the regime running the company will not share the high ideals that currently allow these collection systems to thrive, and it'll be too late to protect the data against that regime.But if you don't work at Google or Facebook and don't have that insight into the seriousness applied to privacy [I have never worked at Facebook, and am only guessing, and might be being over-generous given Cambridge Analytica], it is reasonable to assume the worst, and it is reasonable to ask: what would be a better world, where data was shared only in derived forms with consent and had a time-to-live attached? I'm not sure this book asks that question, but it could lead you to the point where you would ask it.The book is consistently written in a polemical style, using very loaded language: data is always ""plundered,"" not ""collected,"" etc. Maybe that's necessary to wake up some of the audience to the issue; the problem for me is that it implies intent, intent which is being applied to an organization, and what does that mean? Surely not that every human in the organization has that intent; in fact, I don't think it means that the leaders have that intent, or that any individual has that intent. It can really only mean that an emergent behavior of the organization is to behave as if it has this intent, but that's a very abstract thing. If an emergent behavior of the organization can be explained by saying it has this intent, but also through the more reality-based statement that several individuals in that organization have a different intent (e.g. to make users happier by having tools that serve them better by understanding their usage patterns, and assuming that making users happy and profit are a virtuous cycle), does the former somehow swamp the latter?I found this book consistently insulting and frustrating, but it made me think about how to frame my own thoughts. Maybe it would be useful to others in that light."
36,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51266245-kath,4,"I struggled a bit with how I was going to rate this book. I do feel like I learned a lot from this book and it gave me a lot of ideas to chew on. I am the target audience for this book. I already agree with Zuboff on many of her ideas about the inherent issues when it comes to tech companies owning our data, even when that data is an essential part of our person. I don't like the idea that Facebook uses my face as data to be used in facial recognition software just because I put a picture of myself on Instagram. However, this was not a book that was ""fun"" to read. This isn't a devastating criticism. I've read a lot of very academic, hard-to-parse texts (Foucault comes to mind) and I understand that a lot can be gained from a book that is challenging to read. In this case though I felt that Zuboff did not always convey her ideas clearly and it was that and not the level of the ideas that made it hard to read. This book reads a lot like theory and that's probably because it basically is. This book is very well researched with the last 30% being made up of all the notes and sources and Zuboff should be commended for this effort. This makes this book very dense but also very informative. Even when I disagreed with Zuboff, I was able to look at the notes and look further into her claims. I do think Zuboff may overreach slightly in some of her claims, especially in the claim that tech companies and surveillance capitalists are trying to completely erase individuality and that they are already on the way to doing so. I actually don't think this is completely off base as those companies can make more profit if they know exactly how we will react and that is much easier to do if everyone acts the same. These companies also often discuss how the want to streamline our lives and this is much easier to do if they can stop us from making ""bad choices."" I think the problem with Zuboff's argument to this point is that she simply does not provide enough evidence to support her claim that tech companies are well on their way to controlling us to this extent. I think Zuboff's stronger claim comes with her argument that these companies are eroding our belief in democracy. I think this has become clear with their insistence to stand by the policies of taking a completely hands off approach. Recently, after Jack Dorsey of Twitter made the decision to flag some of Donald Trump tweets for misinformation surrounding mail-in ballots, Mark Zuckerberg went on Fox news and said he did not think Facebook should be the arbiter of truth. Well, unfortunately they already are and it sucks. People will often talk about how people need to get out of their echo-chambers but these companies make that really hard because showing people things they disagree with but won't get angry at is bad for their bottom line. I think Zuboff does a good job showing the history of how and why we got to this point. I was a little surprised at which social theorists and sociologists were not in this book. Zuboff does discuss Marx, Polanyi, and Goffman, all theorists I have read, and she does discuss Bentham's panopticon, but only cites Foucault once in this 704 page book. I don't understand how you write a book with this title and not address the ideas of the man who first explicitly connected surveillance and capital accumulation. I also think a discussion of how Louis Althusser's ideas of the ideological state apparatus applies to tech companies in their attempts to get us to act in a certain way would have added an interesting layer to her arguments. As a sociology student, I was left somewhat wanting for more sociological reasoning for her arguments and I think including more sociological theory would have strengthened her argument. I also would have liked to see at least some discussion of the basic flaws in the data these tech companies may be gather to full their algorithm and new technologies. One area I thought about on this topic for a while is predictive policing. Any data put into a predicitive policing algorithm will be biased due to the fact that communities of color have been subject to higher rates of policing for years due to many different racist reasons. Because people of color tend to live in segregated communities due to red-lining and those communities are over-policed, more people of color are arrested. Even if the algorithm somehow doesn't pick up on the race disparities in current police data, it will likely pick up on the geographic differences and therefore, communities of color will continue to be over policed. Zuboff makes the claim that tech companies gathering our data makes them all knowing about our behavior but she does not acknowledge the ways that this data could be biased going in and therefore their conclusions could contain those biases. Even the data provided by the users can be biased because of systematic issues of racism that create differences in access to education and other areas of knowledge. Zuboff makes claims about the ""division of learning."" I think she should have addressed how not all people are given equal access to this domain to begin with. This book also led to some ideas for me to think about in my own research and thinking as a sociologist. I really liked reading about Stanley Milgrams' breaching exercises and how it created such strong social anxiety because he was aware of the fact that he was breaking social norms. I think it would be interesting to think about and study how the increase of social norms related entirely to how we interact online and on social media adds to this social anxiety or transforms the sort of action we perceive as breaking social norms offline. I think this is a great and well researched argument about some of the problems with the way we currently allow private companies to own data we have given them no right to. We are no longer the customer. Targeted advertising does not help me. It is not something that I want, it is something advertisers want and it helps the companies bottom line. I think we should acknowledge this book for what it is; an excellent start to theorizing about this topic. I expect in the future other theorists will flesh out, push back on, build on, and improve the ideas presented in this book, as is the tradition of social theory."

But that doesn't matter cause if you are on such a platform, you really need to read this powerful (though massive) book. The central argument is that the move into the digital realm created an opportunity for companies to capture what she refers to as ""behavioral surplus."" This surpluse comes in the forms of being able to completely track all behaviors of people when they move into the online world (through clicks, time on sites, scrolling, etc) and being able to use such surplus as means of testing and manipulating users down certain pathways; often unknowningly and often for the purpose of generating more revenue for companies. Ultimately, Zuboff is arguing that the move into the digital has turned humans into lab rats, constantly manipulated and used in the purpose of furthering the cache of the lab scientists, while the rats are often going about what they assume is their own business. If this idea feels overwhelming or scary, then you're on the right track. Zuboff wants readers to understand the depth and the degree to which companies nad the many thought leaders (such as Alex Pentland) who are offering such techno-utopias and what we can discover (or rather, control) about humanity is already enacted to a degree that we should find disturbing. Her work is so much more than just a critique of technology though but a complex exploration of how capitalism as an economic force has increasingly become coercive in ways that are violent to the body and mind. It's hard not to read her work and wonder where all of this will lead. Her work is one of those books that make you feel frustrated and maybe helpless but that you know you are the better for having read. "
38,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61750298-yvo-hunink,4,"I was already scared, but now I am terrified.For almost 2 years I have been advocating privacy-by-design solutions for a local government and been pointing out a failing digital infrastructure. Mostly, I did that from a perspective of giving more control to people over their own data. After reading Zuboff, I can safely say I feel uneasy about making any move on the internet, knowing it can create emotional profiles of me with the slightest bit of information. Even typing this review, and goodreads being owned by Amazon, makes me question if it is wise to share my thoughts on all the books I read. However, it not just the content of our data, but even the meta-data around it that can help to create detailed images of someone.We are way more f'cked than we think. It is not that big tech wants to know exactly what we do. It is that they want to be able to predict what we do, so that they can provide guaranteed outcomes to their advertising clients. And now they don't just want to predict our behaviour, they want to control it, in whatever way we are controllable. First it was modification of our digital steps, then it became modification of our physical steps, and now more and more we see the emotional modification that is invading the political sphere.Orwell was right to some extend, but not everything. Firstly, it was not the state, but the company that created this paradigm (though the US and China have jumped on this boat now too), and secondly, it was not the modification of our soul into a preset condition of belief, but our behaviour as a predictable organism that we are being seduced into. Especially young people are being damaged for life right now. We need to act soon.Let there be a digital future, but let there be a human one first. This quote from Zuboff says it all for me. We now need to focus on setting the right fundaments of a digital society, and retake what is ours -> our humanity.Why not 5? While the critique of Zuboff is very detailed, I am missing a toolbox to change this paradigm. What should we do? As individuals, but also as governments, or socially responsible companies. The book leaves us with only a few handles to act upon. Also I am missing some more statistics. Societal values are not always captured in numbers, but it would be good to reflect a bit on how big the problem actually is, or where the biggest impact is, so that we could specify corrective measures in a better way."
39,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28060227-hannah-cook,2,"I really wanted to love this book as the subject is fascinating and horrifying and right up my alley. However it has a few things about it that i don't love. As I read it I was thinking man this is like someone's Phd thesis (ie impenetrable and a lot of ""as we saw in chapter 1 blah blah"" and ""we will see in chapter 2 blah blah"" - it's like, if you didn't do that every constantly the book would be half as long). And then I checked out the author and she is a Harvard academic. So that it explains it. Not that everything should be dumbed down, but this feels like it is purposefully trying to be hyper intellectual and the result is a giant yawn fest. My other issue with it is that she doesn't actually clearly enough articulate what the problem with surveillance capitalism is. Or rather, her argument is not that compelling to me. There is a lot of ""surveillance capitalism is causing us to lose the will to will"" (wtf) and it is ""stealing our right to a future tense"" (also wtf). But, as I mentioned in an earlier comment, my dad made a much better argument when he said that surveillance capitalism is bad for the environment. The author goes on about modifying human behaviour, but fails to spell out that it is modifying our behaviour so we BUY MORE STUFF. And consumption is what is destroying the planet. Because she focuses on the ""right to future tense"" stuff, and relegates environmental destruction to something that was caused by the industrial revolution onwards, rather than something that is caused by how we/corporations behave now, I think she is missing more than half the story (which is quite an achievement in a book so long). All that is not to say that I don't have a renewed distrust of Google and Facebook et al. They really are the absolute worst."

The book wasn't the easiest read though, because it felt very academic and had a lot of economics and sociology vocabulary (and a lot of repetition, but that's common in nonfiction), so the writing style was difficult for me. The author seems to have been thorough though, and did a good job covering both concrete events and announcements as well as abstracting it all (though the abstractions seem to be geared more towards economists/sociologists).It was interesting to read this while also reading the biography of John D. Rockefeller, Sr. There are interesting parallels, which will hopefully continue in the form of regulations eventually catching up to the industry....Anyway, why read science fiction when you can read about our current surveillance capitalist world instead?

It provides a lot of valuable information and seems to be very well researched. My biggest problem was that authorial voice struck me as shrill and whiney. I'm fine with a good polemic. Karl Marx was the master of that kind of thing, and if Ms. Zuboff had written her book in the Marxian tradition as Surveillance Kapital, I would have had a rollicking good time with it. But while she uses a lot of perjorative terminology and is consistently negative, she doesn't really land a lot of solid blows. Another possibly better way to have written the book would have been to write it in a neutral matter of fact style and let her targets damn themselves with their actions.By putting herself in full-on attack mode, Ms. Zuboff loses the ability to acknowledge that Google in particular and to a lesser extent Facebook have done a lot of good that has actually enriched our lives. I do agree that there is some dangerous bad stuff that comes along with the good. I'd like to have more control over my own identity than seems to be possible any longer, and I am uncomfortable with the idea that big data algorithms can be used to shape my behavior in ways that I might not like if I were conscious of what was being done to me. Still, I wouldn't throw the baby out with the bathwater. Anybody who remembers internet search before Google knows that we have come a long way, and though much of Facebook is bogus and mind numbing, it provides a nice way for people who are separated to stay connected. I don't like some of the darker sides of surveillance, but I am happy to have ads served to me for products that might actually interest me.I was surprised that Ms. Zuboff never mentions Foucault's famous ""Discipline and Punish"" which is clearly in synch with her point of view. Foucault points out that the rationalization of the prison system going from trial by ordeal and brutal public punishment to trial by jury and ""rehabilitation"" in prisons, though ostensibly a move in the direction of rationality, humanity and justice, was really a way for those in power to exercise greater control with a result that was ulitmately more dehumanizing than the system it replaced. Foucault also saw the modern prison as being the model for all dehumanizing mass organizations of modern socienty -- the factory, the army, bureaucracies and even hospitals and schools. At least Foucault had the courage to acknowledge that these same prison-based inhuman institutions are the basis for modern prosperity, so that we probably have to accept them if we want the good parts of the modern world. Interestingly, Ms Zuboff does briefly reference Jeremy Bentham's panopticon, which for Foucault was the utimate metaphor for the modern prison.Another issue that I had with this book is Ms. Zuboff's glorification of old fashioned individualism and democracy as the antidote to the problems that she describes. In this regard, I think that she is incredibly naive and even a bit of a Luddite. I don't have a problem with the idea of moving toward a more collective society. China and Japan have always had much more collective cultures than Western Europe and the United States, yet they seem to be doing just fine in the modern world. And democracy as practiced in the United States today is already so broken for other reasons that I'm reluctant to rely on it as the way out of these problems. The solution to the problems described in this book has to be forward looking to have any chance of success. We do need to find a way to rehumanize our culture, but let's do it by making the best use of the tools at hand, not by turning back the clock. It's not about throwing wrenches into the machine, it's about building better machines that facilitate and encourage real human interaction, and backing that up with humanistic education (not just STEM) that will build the values that we need to have to move hopefully into the future. We also need to have a regulatory framework that recognizes a stronger right to own our own information and that requires a much higher level of transparency and disclosure (GDPR is a good start in this direction, though it has many serious flaws.) I see this as a giant Red Queen's Race between the forces of humanity and inhumanity. The forces of humanity need to be running faster and faster just to stay in the same place, but I think that is absolutely possilble. The future will probably look very different from the present, and it will not necessarily be a place where I would be comfortable living, but it does not have to be awful or dehumanizing, and the further growth of technology and greater understaning of how to use big data will bring some incredible benefits along with some undoubted problems."
45,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70474434-carsten,5,"When I finished TAOSC last night, I knew that I just had finished an important book. The accumulation of data by Google, Facebook, Twitter and other internet giants has changed, and will further change, society from the ground-up. The question is: how much control will  we  have over the data and how it is used? Who has the power? As Zuboff asks:  Who knows? Who decides? Who decides who decides?  The book is divided in three parts. The first part (The Foundation of Surveillance Capitalism) traces the origins of SC (the stories of Google and Facebook are told here). The second part (The Advance of Surveillance Capitalism) describes how the internet giants (again Google, Facebook in particular) invaded every part of our lives and how it dealt with criticism. The last part (Instrumentarian Power for a Third Modernity) is rather theoretical but I felt that it is an essential part of TAOSC: How will SC affect democracy? How will a future society look like if SC is left unchecked? Chapter 16, in which Zuboff describes how we can witness life in a SC society (she calls it the ""hive"") by watching our children growing up, left me deeply worried that many politicians are too slow (unwillingly but possibly also willingly) in understanding the impact of unchecked SC on society. I have given the book 5 stars because I feel this is an important book and should be widely read. But it is a long book, possibly too long. The points made in this book can be written down in a book half that length. I found reading it hard work, but I can recommend TAOSC highly. If you are looking for a similar but shorter book on this topic, I recommend Jamie Bartlett's book  ""The People vs Tech"" , but Zuboff goes much deeper."

At least the Cliff's Notes version - it is quite long (19 cds). At times I felt I was in a classroom, and I certainly learned a lot of new vocabulary. Besides Surveillance Capitalism, some of the concepts Zuboff introduced were Instrumentarianism, Big Other, and Behavioral Surplus. The big 4 - Facebook, Google, Apple & Microsoft - are and have been collecting our behavioral surplus data and monetizing it for years. The questions we all need to be asking about our data are: Who knows? Who decides who knows? And who decides who decides? Search any of these terms and you'll find interviews with Zuboff.

It is not necessary to agree with every single point she makes here (and I don't) to be dumbstruck by the overall argument. To be astonished at how she manages to connect the dots on what's been happening in the past two decades, identifying and describing phenomena that's at once pervasive and yet somehow invisible. It's been in front of us all along -- we just didn't have a language for what we were seeing. Until now.How do we suppose that Google and Facebook became so immensely huge and rich companies in such a comparatively short time, when the services they are offering are free to the end user?

We need to know all this; but in a more accessible form."

They are using this data and their knowledge about it to sell us stuff. Now ... they are moving into the world of action to herd us into one direction or another and life as they wish within the hive, all the while fattening their pockets as they increasingly control our lives. There is nothing we can do about it. We all might as well sit back, sign in, and pretend like we are having fun.Get the idea??Shoshana Zuboff has produced a new political economy of the Internet Age. Some unpacking is needed to make sense of it.For starters, the argument provides an overall economic logic for the digital age. This is the idea of ""surveillance capitalism"", as opposed to industrial capitalism, which is what we had with Standard Oil or General Motors. For such an argument, you get a bit of costs, benefits, markets, capital investments, margins, and the like. But information economics has always been a bit strange. You do not use up informational assets, for example, the idea of reputation or brand - the while idea of intangible assets. Markets for informational products can be completely conquered and industry dominance is possible. Hitting the ""copy"" botton is easy as opposed to markets for durable goods such as autos or washing machines. There are also multiple users for the same product - this is the idea of multiple platforms. For example, I am interested in the information on my fitbit for its health implications whereas someone else might want my data and background for my likelihood of purchasing some other digital products. Zuboff provides an overall argument for how digital markets grow very big and lucrative on the basis of lots of small individual transactions that most users pay very little for. Google and Facebook, as well as others, collect your direct data as well as some metadata and lump it in with other massive data sets to provide the source for their lucrative business in various computer futures' markets. There is a profit logic here and an explanation for the huge growth of the FAANG firms. This logic does not exclude the possibility that these firms also provide valuable services to their users and offer real benefits. For example, if Google or Amazon server as a broad structure within which many small businesses and individual users may operate, then it is reasonable that they act to keep their structures safe, which may entail taking action against individuals or businesses that do not follow rules, such as regarding protection against malware and viruses. The ""greater good"" logic is not without merit in such cases.But wait, there is more. This is also a political economy, which means that the underlying values and normative directions of the parties are involved, as well as issues of ownership and property rights. Yes, they can and do sell your data and there is very little your can do about it by yourself. It is not quite like totalitarianism, but maybe it is. If not, why spend so much time explaining what totalitarianism is? I would add that when an author goes to the trouble to show how pointless it is to read all of the conditions offered in various terms of service by these firms and the huge difficulties of resisting, the reader is quite justified in responding - Well if I do not have a choice about it, then do I really have a problem? A bunch of very smart people are in the same situation as I am and cannot do anything about it, so what is the real issue?What's the problem? Privacy, of course. ...and the logic of accumulation (profit) means that the key firms will be doing more and more with your data and moving into areas where you will be ""nudged"" into thinking certain ways and not others and even pushed into acting as a herd with others. This is all for your own good, of course, and we should get beyond freedom and dignity. B.B. Skinner has come back from the grave. What people will lose in this is the chance to control their own futures, forge their own identities, and manage their own data. Those who object to being manipulated by ""big other"" need to get off the grid - oh, but you cannot get off the grid.I am starting to get worried again. Zuboff is a longtime professor and scholar on the future of ""smart machines"" at the Harvard Business School. This is the central temple of capitalism. Are we really all under the thumb of Google, Amazon, and Facebook? Perhaps not.Zuboff is clearly writing in the tradition of the great progressive muckrakers. In particular, the book reads as if she is auditioning to be the new Ida Tarbell, who took on the Standard Oil monopoly and was instrumental in breaking it up. The muckrakers had lots to say about how evil and powerful the industrial trusts were, how bad they were for society, and how impervious they were to individual resistance. And yet -- Standard Oil was broken up even though the world had failed to go to the devil on its account as anticipated. Besides, it was only after Standard Oil was broken up that John D. Rockefeller got really rich. Maybe we are not yet all doomed.If one reads enough dystopian fiction, it soon is clear that the dire predictions of the author reflect those aspects of the current world situation that the author finds most questionable. The world has proven notoriously resilient in the face of collusive big business, at least so far.Another way to see this is to consider the broader literature of digital and internet trade books, especially for business audiences. While they are generally informative, these book are also notorious in wildly exaggerating the likely course of invention and innovation. Far too many arguments about the promise of the digital age have proven overblown. It seems reasonable to me that negative predictions about the future of digital behemoths would also err towards overstatement rather than understatement. I would not suggest that the authors of business trade books are selling their arguments as hard as they can, but maybe they are. The extremes may need a bit of discounting.While the book is fun to read, it is written in a style that seems prone to extremes. For example, Zuboff goes to a lot of trouble to explain what totalitarianism is, but then argues that rule by FAANG is not totalitarian and that Facebook will not actually torture or execute anyone (I was relieved to know this.). But which is it? If the dominance of Google and Facebook is so threatening, then it is like totalitarianism. If not, why go through the analysis? If the digital firms want all of our data and can largely just take it, and we can do nothing about it, then what part of this is not totalitarian?This whole line of thought about whether the digital world of surveillance capitalism is our friend or not is hardly new. Of course there is The Matrix, but this are more philosophical problems at root (look up the ""brains in a vat"" argument behind the Matrix story), since there are not the capitalist villains to focus on like the leaders of Google, Alphabet, and Facebook. That tension even made it to popular music. Look up a recording of the song ""Chiron Beta Prime"" from 2009.At a basic level, it seems that Zuboff is more concerned that life in the Google or Facebook domains will lead to intellectually and emotionally impoverished lives for those who are connected all the time. This is akin to the arguments for the coddling of the newest college generation (gen z) which has grown up on Facebook and Google. This is a reasonable concern on its own terms, although way too much apocalypse is invoked in the book. But even here, there are earlier versions of the argument. One in particular is how capitalism itself triumphed versus the socialist world because it was successful at supplying rampant consumerism. The is Herbert Marcuse's argument from ""One Dimensional Man"" (1964), although I do not need networked computing for this.Overall, it is a thoughtful and thought provoking book, albeit a bit too long. Zuboff develops her own nomenclature for surveillance capitalism and related arguments and drums it into the reader through repetition. I am not sure I needed the repetition, however. It is a much better book than many of the HBS trade volumes, but that is unfortunately a low bar. I am glad I read the book."

Yes, Google Glass seemed like a cool concept at the time, and sure, the Chromebook was so cheap that it proved irresistible for millions, and god only knows how many Android aficionados are out there.....but the reality is, these are all incurrences for ""behavioral surplus"" for the tech giants, whose power through data collection grows unchecked by the day. We all love free or subsidized tech stuff, but I don't disagree that the joke is on us as a society, because while this new subsidized data collection paradigm gives consumers like you and me plenty, as Zuboff drives home in spades in this book, oh does it take back so much more....I suppose the downright scary part to it all is that it all goes on unchecked (save for Europe's half hearted attempt to invoke privacy laws two years ago.) That's only going to continue until our current legal system figures out a way to become properly equipped to deal with this new phenomenon. History does provide hope through precedence however, as the industrial revolution 125 years ago brought about a complete upheaval of our legal system through both land and labor law. Perhaps the new age of surveillance capitalism will bring about ""digital privacy law."" The question is, who brings about this change in the near term? I may not buy whole-heartedly the doom and gloom instrumentarian society or ""hive-existence"" outcomes that the author is selling, but I don't disagree (not unlike the doomed proverbial frog in a pot whose temperature is rising by a degree a minute), that unless we do something soon current societal ""givens"" like privacy and sanctuary will become things of the past as the data giants grow unchecked in financial and political power. I also don't believe that ""individualism"" or ""free-will"" is a fleeting 18th Century phenomenon whose time has come and gone. When a society gets a taste of freedom/free-will, it will tend to fight like hell to keep it, rather than let it float away in exchange for the security of a ""Big Other."" That's just my hunch, and time will have to prove me right or wrong on that. Again, what I can't answer is what brings about this initiative to react and push back??One more issue I do have with Zuboff is her assertion that Facebook will be a long term player in the continuation of SC. User trends change at lightening speed these days. The generation Z kids that Zuboff claims have become hooked on their FB connectivity includes my own kids. My 15 year old son doesn't use facebook. He has no interest. Thinks its ""creepy and for old folks."" Nor do any of his friends use it. Clearly something is happening at the user level with the youth of today that's creating significant churn at FB that could possibly threaten FB's future dominance on social media. So who the true long term players are on this scene is still subject to scrutiny, but this is akin to focusing on the furniture on the Titanic... This is a highly thought provoking draconian wake up call to the modern world about what could possibly happen if current trends are not thwarted. While it doesn't provide possible solutions to the subject matter at hand, it will leave your wheels spinning long after you close out the final chapter of this book..."

Surveillance capitalism is the name Zuboff has given to a disturbing new threat, a novel, rapacious strain of capitalism that uses its ownership of the means of digital production to acquire behavioural data in increasingly invasive ways from its users to predict and, increasingly, to modify their behaviour. Zuboff has done important work in naming this threat and describing its genealogy.I have a few issues with this book. Firstly, I was not a fan of the writing style. It’s basically endless chiasmus, repetition, lists of threes, and hyperbole. It’s an irritating habit in a book of this length, and makes it difficult to appreciate the more profound passages (of which there are several).The latter - hyperbole - is also an issue of substance. While the more radical ambitions of the priests of surveillance capitalism are terrifying (and some of these ideas are already going in to prototype), the actual lived experience of surveillance capitalism for most people is markedly different. I watch a YouTube video on yoga; the next day, I get several ads for yoga mats next to a news article I am reading. Is this an existential threat to the very essence of human freedom, as Zuboff claims in her typically impassioned way? I’m not so sure. Of course, this may just be the beginning; I am sure I’m not even conscious of all the ways my data is being used to influence my actions. But the risk here is that Zuboff misses the tension that exists between what capitalism promises and what it delivers; the prospect of intelligent algorithims manifest as slightly more refined marketing tools (and the effectiveness of which, compared to traditional marketing, have been questioned elsewhere). The possibility that this gap is something systemic in capitalism drops out of Zuboff’s analysis. What does it mean that the titans of capitalism’s newest mutation are effectively advertising companies? Advertising companies were traditionally considered drains on the productive economy; advertising costs are ultimately still costs for businesses that take away from their bottom lines. The massive hoards of cash on the books of Google, Facebook and co., derived mainly from advertising revenue, come from firms which necessarily sell goods or services. What does this mean for profitability? What does this mean for investment and innovation? Is this really a system in rude health? (Tooze, Picketty, and Milankovic have all had recent takes on this question, and it’s a shame Zuboff doesn’t really address it.) But when governments are desperate to spark investment, including through record low interest rates, what does it mean when firms are spending fortunes on advertising, creating piles of cash which accumulate in offshore bank accounts? Zuboff misses this level of analysis, because in her approach the threat has already been identified and so must be made to look powerful.If anything, it’s the prospect of collusion between surveillance capitalism and the state that still worries me the most for now - though I’m not sure if the ‘behavioural surplus’ framework is best suited to describe this kind of threat. This isn’t to say that I don’t think surveillance capitalism is a concern. Zuboff is convincing enough in that respect. But as long as I can say no to that yoga mat, I’m not sure if I should fear it more than I do capitalism and massive hoards of wealth more generally. For now, at least..."
54,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43726398-apar-gupta,2,"Human cognition is a function of language. It may seem obvious, but in the absence of articulated legibility, we are bereft of comprehension, left without the ability of analysis, if not planned action. This is a difficult task for scholars at times when social change is occurring so visibly and dramatically that it challenges academic calm. In the rapidly changing ecology of a digitised society, the challenge becomes greater when analysis is not limited to the present but extended to the future. The Age of Surveillance Capitalism attempts precisely this.The phrase has a definite phonetic appeal. Though the coinage cannot be attributed neatly to Zuboff, she underlines its importance to the networked world. The polysemy of “surveillance capitalism” is defined in stark, clear terms of digital doom. Described as, “a new economic order that claims human experience as free raw material”, “a parasitic economic logic”, “a rogue mutation” even a “significant threat to human nature”. While to some this may seem polemical, the book serves an important function even as social invective.Monthly data breaches, disinformation spread over digital networks and the large-scale deployment of biometric technologies has sensitised large numbers of people in India. But to what? We lack the grammar and framework to understand the rapid changes in our environment. The pace of technological change is easily matched by its scale, creating a perpetual tension between the ways of the past and the reality of the present. As the firm roots of individual liberty of our constitutional values, democratic traditions of political participation and the relationship between the individual and the state are thrown into contest, we urgently need help. This has to start with language. Zuboff provides it readily, explaining this point of history as the “second modernity”: “[W]e live in this collision between a centuries-old story of modernisation and a decades-old story of economic violence that thwarts our pursuit of effective life.”These are big concepts which are parsed by documenting the project of conservative economic thought with the execution of state policy, particularly in the US. References to Europe are inadequate, indicating the geographical limitation of the work. This is an important limitation that also affects learning from countries like India. For instance, one of the underlying elements of surveillance capitalism, is what is termed as the “uncontract”. This goes beyond the terms of service which many smartphone users promptly agree to, swiping them away as an annoyance delaying the delivery of desired digital reward. It is explained as, “uncontract desocialises the contract… [and] human agency… [it] bypasses all that social work in favour of compulsion…” It is hard to read these sentences without thinking about the compulsory biometric programme, Aadhaar which remains voluntary only in theory, but for all practical purposes has become a mandatory requirement.Geographical limitation is not merely cosmetic. Large parts of the commentary are focussed on the rise and the commercial imperatives of Google and Facebook. As Zuboff explains, their actions are premeditated and with disregard for the harms that result from the ceaseless, pervasive and ubiquitous collection of personal data. Both companies service a large number of internet users in India, a number which continues to grow, even outstripping other countries. Hence, beyond Aadhaar, the entire project of surveillance capitalism is being implemented in India by Silicon Valley giants. It is only natural that the product choices made in such a large market will impact users even in Western liberal democracies, to which the book caters.This does not diminish the importance of Surveillance Capitalism, which is already providing fertile ground to scholars. But many of them have found it lacking in scholarly rigour. This is not to say that references are lacking — on the contrary, the endnotes are extensive, and care has been taken to make them engaging. However, there are obvious leaps of coinage, in which bridges to existing scholarship on surveillance are not built. For instance, influential conceptual frameworks which have been conventionally utilised for understanding surveillance and power asymmetries such as Michel Foucault’s Discipline and Punish (1975) are ignored.Equally troubling was the disregard for the existing legal doctrines of informational privacy and competition law. While Zuboff argues that this modern predicament is unprecedented, the law, even its conceptual boundaries, are being tested and explored. For instance, in the Supreme Court of India’s right to privacy judgment in 2017 (which is ignorantly derided as a “bundle of essays”), several individual opinions of judges link privacy to a broad swathe of fundamental rights. They even point to the dangers of unchecked expropriation of personal data to be a fundamental re-ordering of power that poses a danger to free will and autonomy.Given the importance of Surveillance Capitalism, even if isolated to the conversations prompted by it, criticisms will need to be engaged with in good faith. This will help us deepen human understanding of both the nature of the problems we face and the opportunity for a better world. This is a tough ask. Many analysts draw an artificial boundary between digital convenience enabling a multitude of human function, and its critical examination. No wonder important works fail to find popular resonance and subsequent political action. While the solution to these problems may not seem to be any closer, this book provides it’s readers many mental Lego pieces.This book is a reminder that words are not only created by bureaucratic reviews of the board of editors of an English dictionary. They are more often defined by emotional weight, as in the personal essays employed by Zuboff. To know what we are feeling, we need terms capable of describing it accurately. In this service of a basic human need to articulate, Surveillance Capitalism not only provides us with language, but also sounds a much-needed alarm."

We know about the rise in power of Big Data, we know we're being surveilled through our devices and appliances, we know companies are using behavior modification to better serve us for their own profit. But this is a detailed look at the history and sociology of surveillance capitalism and how some companies are using it.Zuboff has a pessimistic take on these ideas, for sure, and the book goes heavy on Facebook and Google. I did feel at times that I would have liked a lot more statistics and real life examples. A little more story certainly would have broken up Zuboff's prose, which is incredibly dense in its philosophizing and sometimes hard to digest (I usually don't have a problem with dense writing, but I had to slog through sentences that I felt could have been written more simply). So I'm a little torn on this, because it's an important book people should read, but the writing and lack of examples and length (could have been shorter, or the same length but with more story and stats weaved in?) make it a challenging read. Maybe it's just a case of me having really high expectations and the book falling short, which still makes it good, just something I'll be recommending to fewer people."
56,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/99939608-stephen-adams,5,"“If you are not paying for the product then you are the product.” Though this quote has been used since the 1980s in relation to television [1], it has seen a resurgence due to the popularity of social media. I have always found this idea to be troublesome because if my online behaviour was “the product” of social media it would have some value on its own. Shoshana Zuboff’s excellent “The Age of Surveillance Capitalism” closes this gap between our personal experiences online and the industry that is tracking as much of our lives as possible.  The book is broken into three parts. Part one focuses on the early history of Google and its discovery of the concept of “behavioural surplus.” Behavioral surplus is the digital “breadcrumbs” or “exhaust,” as the author puts it, that we leave behind on every website we visit. These breadcrumbs are the unrefined resource that surveillance capitalist products are constructed from. The second section of the book charts surveillance capitalism’s move from being an entirely online phenomenon into the “real” world. With the development of the internet of things, the success of Pokemon Go, and Facebook’s experiments affecting their user’s emotions and behaviours more of our daily lives have become commodities to be sold in “behavioural futures markets.”The final section is where Zuboff becomes more speculative about the future of surveillance capitalism. She describes a system of power known as “instrumentarianism” where the entirety of our lives is tracked and predicted, and power is centralised around controlling the means of behaviour modification. This section heavily references Hannah Arendt’s “The Origins of Totalitarianism” as a reference to how political movements get started and flourish despite their grim final state. Instrumentarianism is an existential threat to our lives as individuals. Under instrumentarian power our individual choices are pushed in the most predictable and profitable direction consuming our sense of self in the process.I think this is an excellent book. The first two extensively researched parts track the evolution of surveillance capitalism so far via public statements of the executives and engineers mostly from Google and Facebook, as well as employee interviews Zuboff conducted herself. Zuboff draws a clear thread from Google’s discovery of behavioural surplus in the early 2000s to today with more and more consumer products being always online. These two sections shed light on the underlying imperatives that drive surveillance capitalist decision making (e.g. why do they buy the companies they do?, why do they launch the products they do?).Instrumentarianism as a theoretical end state of surveillance capitalism is a terrifying warning. The powers that surveillance capitalists now wield are so new and unexpected that we must begin to ask where will all this lead? As the author points out surveillance capitalism is the first time in human history that a single power has held both knowledge of our lives along with the freedom of the market rather than in the hands of a government that is accountable to the people. Though not a certainty, Zuboff’s theory of instrumentarianism is feasible enough that everyone should hear her warning and make up their own minds.1. https://quoteinvestigator.com/2017/07..."

It reminded me of Thomas Piketty’s magnum opus, Capital in the Twenty-First Century, in that it opens one’s eyes to the things we ought to have noticed, but hadn’t. If we fail to take the new capitalist rampaging through our societies, then we will only have ourselves to blame, for we can no longer plead ignorance. The combination of state surveillance and its capitalist counterpart means that digital technology is separating the citizens in all societies into two groups: the watchers (invisible, unknown, unaccountable) and the watched. This has profound consequences for democracy because asymmetry of knowledge translates to asymmetry of power. We currently have almost no regulatory oversight of this technological phenomenon. This is intolerable. Thank you Shoshana Zuboff. I am a changed man because of your book."
58,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1910680-steve,4,"""The Age of Surveillance Capitalism"" is a detailed explanation of the threat to freedom and our humanity present in big tech, the giants Google and Facebook, and their aspirations to know not only your preferences; to predict future actions and decisions and to construct a comprehensive view of the person and society. The idol and the end-game is comprehensive knowledge.Zuboff believes this is the new totalitarian threat, not only big government, but big tech, or even both working together to manage society. She explains how the ""social credit"" scheme in China uses universal monitoring to apportion resources and privileges based on lifestyle habits, behaviour and compliance.he greater concern for the West is that this new type of ""capitalism"" sees personal and behavioural data as a unclaimed reserve to be exploited to generate vast revenues, but also to build comprehensive data sets with massive predictive power. The reason why social media is free to the end user, and the tech giants have acquired numerous start-ups and new tech business is because of the new data sets that provide.Conservative readers will be slightly frustrated by Ms. Zuboff's left-leaning and sometimes shrill tone, but it would be a mistake to write-off her main thesis due to bias. True conservatives will find much to sympathise with here.A century ago, G. K. Chesterton and Hilaire Belloc warned that the threats to liberty come, not only from socialism and big government, but also from big business and its alliance with government. They obviously did not foresee these technological innovations and their coercive power, but they rightly drew attention to the duel nature of the threat."

The book also contains references to the usual Google & Facebook when it comes down to the data they collect on us (more or less with our consent nowadays), as well as what the information is used for (their own as well as sold for profit). Many examples as well as references are presented. It was a useful read, especially for people unaware of these things, but as a fan of Snowden and Assange, surveillance wasn't a topic strange to me and as a result the lack of extremely novel information didn't make this feel like a particularly stimulating read. #B"

The argument is blind to how Big Tech's surveillance is merely the most recent and sophisticated manifestation of capitalism's inherent drive to extract value; advertising and media companies have for centuries made a business of surveillance and control.

69,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/89255731-mark-walker,5,"This book will boil your blood. Supported by extensive empirical research, Professor Shoshana Zuboff exposes the effective digital implementation of the late B. F. Skinner's Beyond Freedom and Dignity. It centers around three related factors: The distribution of knowledge: “Who knows?” Authority: “Who decides who knows?” and Power: “Who decides who decides who knows?” (Hint: it's not you). Orders of magnitude beyond just tracking cookies and the creepy anticipation of your interests by entities such as Google, Amazon, and Facebook, the new instrumentarianism is used by surveillance capitalists to control not just what you buy but also what you think about and how you think it. This is not even the theoretical Capitalism of Friedman, Hayek, or Adam Smith, as there is no equality of individual choice in it. In other words there's no free market here, as surveillance capitalists deliberately orchestrate your life for their benefit irrespective of yours. Thus it's not a fair trade; there is no reciprocity in the conveniences you think you receive from even the simplest transactions. You are not their customers (or even the ""product"" as in the cliché); their customers are the people purchasing the information harvested about you, which is extracted without your awareness. In this digital realm, it is as if you are the third world country having your natural resources extracted for the exclusive profits of foreign capitalists. Another clear analogy is we are like chickens being farmed for our eggs: they feed us with incentives, not for our well-being but so that we will lay more eggs to go into omelets not for us. You and your personal information are only the objects, the ""Other,"" that are for sale for the benefit of people who are not you. The key feature of all of this is that willingness is irrelevant, as we are unknowing and thus unwitting participants. Their salient objective is the obscene profits garnered from not just your profiles and posts, but the shadow text that you don't see from the fusion of the backscatter data about you that is harvested into separate secret databases. They actively hide that they have this information on you, as their modus operandi requires that you not be aware of it for this process to be successful. Much of this activity is beyond the reach of laws and courts, as the surveillance capitalists would just go underground with their operations if regulations were imposed. It is accompanied by an acceleration of the deliberate assault on democracy through lobbying and revolving door employment between government and the commercial interests that control it. Thus just voting for politicians that promise to tame surveillance capitalism will be of insufficient effect. Zuboff offers hope and some thoughts on what to do about it. European history has shown that when the people have had enough of oppression, they join together to rebel, as when the Berlin Wall came down without resistance from the guards. A similar event must occur today to escape the glass walls of the hive surveillance capitalists have put us in for the purpose of harvesting and orchestrating even our most personal thoughts, all for their profit and not ours. We need walls of our own, not to keep us in their hive, but to keep them out of our personal sanctuary. Public opinion is key to taming this monster. In the end if enough of the public rose up against surveillance capitalism, possibly by throwing its shadow text in disarray and diminishing its value, the money and influence behind it would then be of little effect. There is hope if humans would willingly help each other to the extent that surveillance capitalists take without asking. Then the world would be a much friendlier and more prosperous place for everyone. and not just the few."
70,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6192529-frieda-vizel,3,"The writing was a big problem for me. Sometimes, instead of relying on strong arguments, it relied on absurdly hyperbolic language. For instance, I didn’t feel like she explained clearly enough why monetizing our data is bad - say, because how it’s been destroying “the forth estate” that needs to constantly run after the clicks, or how our data is used to manipulate us to consume-consume-consume, to the detriment of the planet. Instead she went on for a while about our right to the “will to will” and a lot about how bad BF Skinner was. Maybe if I understood behaviorism better I’d have felt it as strongly as she seemed to, but I just didn’t feel like I totally got that whole part. Maybe that’s me.Speaking of Skinner, she seems to be of the school of public intellectualism that is very focused on individual actors instead of on the system. So she goes on a lot about the bad guys of our predicament, Skinner but also of course Zuck, the Google founders, the guy at Microsoft who didn’t seem to be extraordinarily villainous at all. Here’s where this type of focus in the individual derails us: it leads Zuboff to think that these people created the problems, and not the system. But actually, so long as the law allows for folks to make money by manipulating the masses, there will always be a sociopath to sink his teeth in. That’s why the problem is the system and that needs to be fixed. And Zuboff does argue for that - it’s just that she weakens her argument by being so focused on these insatiable idiot vampires. But all that is quibbling and frustration. The important take-away from the book is that it stakes the solution within the law. It does not fall for the “freedom of speech” idiocy, an argument mounted by economic interest as a way to stop the entire legal system from functioning as it should. Since when can’t we have laws? Since when is it tyranny for the government to create limits and parameters as a way of ensuring a healthy society? Since the tech companies have been telling us that we only deserve positive freedoms. Freedom to advertise, sure. Freedom from being manipulated by ads- it’s an Orwellian Communist murderous regime and soon we will be like North Korea!Zuboff talks about the slow speed of democracy. That’s what left me so despaired. Democracy is not getting faster, but the technological invasions are. And I don’t see how we’ll ever be able to catch up with them. Meanwhile, a screech on a decibel undetectable to the human ear is now screaming into your subconscious and telling you to buy another Alexa and a smart underwear plus to to vote for Kim Jung Il.

The future of this narrative will depend upon the indignant citizens, journalists, and scholars drawn to this frontier project; indignant elected officials and policy makers who understand that their authority originates in the foundational values of democratic communities; and, especially, indignant young people who act in the knowledge that effectiveness without autonomy is not effective, dependency-induced compliance is no social contract, a hive with no exit can never be home, experience without sanctuary is but a shadow, a life that requires hiding is no life, touch without feel reveals no truth, and freedom from uncertainty is no freedom.This book is an incendiary work of immense scholarly and literary significance.With admiral restraint, Zuboff painstakingly dismantles, analyses, and lays bear the machinations of one of the greatest challenges that faces humanity in this century. We have be come not the product, as is so often said, but the raw material of an entirely novel industry. This industry's speed of ascent and adaptation and especially of innovation has left individuals and governments alike, completely unable to meaningfully understand, let alone reign-in, the advance of this all-pervading entity that increases its penetration into our lives and our communities with every passing minute.This book articulates the uncomfortable gut-feeling, the uneasy sense of cognitive dissonance, that I've felt about the level of access companies generally, but especially Alphabet and Facebook, have to my life and every piece of information living that life generates. I understand now why my no-choice participation in this new economy has generated these feelings, in all their expanded and terrifying entirety.While at times bombastic, and others poetic, and others still cool and clinical; the amount of research, time, and passion for humanity itself that went into the construction of this work has paid off. This work is a significant achievement, and an important moment that we can look back on to see whether we as a species can rise to overcome this new challenge, or whether this will be little but foreshadowing of the future we allow to follow.If you're alive right now, you owe it to yourself to read this."

The use and abuse of data and user trust is worth talking about, it's even worth shouting about.But not like this.Zuboff is alarmist, melodramatic, hyperbolic and tiring. Everything the tech companies do is not just wrong, it's a diabolic scheme to undermine the world as we know it. When something is wrong, it's never an unintended consequence, it's never human error, it's never just a silly gimmick not thought out far enough. It's always, always presented as a evil contrived mastermind plot to wreck your privacy and abuse you. And it's always presented like it's the rise of fascism in the 1930's with the most gut-wrenching tear-jerking vocabulary she could find. Get a few examples, simplify a theory somehow related to the issue, contrive a concept, give it a name like ""shadow text"" or ""behavioral surplus"" (preferably a bit ominous name), cherry pick more examples, portend doom. Rinse and repeat. And mention ""surveillance capitalism"" at least 15 times per page.It's kind of ironic that when she goes on for 700+ pages on how you should never trust these companies, that she takes their Silicon Valley hypetalk at face value. If a company claims they can do something, Zuboff gleefully integrates the claim into her narrative with zero criticism. Because it serves her point. But if a company apologises for something, it's of course disingenuous with them being the devil who wants to eat your children.By the time the book gets to behaviour manipulation, it turns from melodramatic to laughable. The obsession Zuboff has for B.F.Skinner and radical behaviorism (a 70-year-old psychology concept, the cognitive revolution would like to have a word...) is full on religious. The man wasn't wrong about anything and conditioning works on people with a hundred per cent efficiency!This is an important issue, but creating hyperbolic devils like this is not just bad writing and argumentation but counter-productive to the cause. It's just creates a shoddy boogeyman argument that is easy to shoot down.The very serious and dramatic reader Audible had for this didn't help btw. (she was very clear speaker though). "

Everyone knows that the technology we are living with is unprecedented and changing the world. If we aren't careful, we will cause more harm than good. This book is about the dangers of this new information age. But there are a lot of problems with how the information is presented. First, the author uses over-the-top insulting language to describe these companies and leaders--all book long. It's so obviously biased that it undermines her points again and again, prompting lots of eyerolling--about once a page. That's minor, though. More serious is that this book is way too long. It wasn't satisfied making the point, it had to list 10 examples for every point--the full quotes, too. It read more like a college term paper that needed show every piece of research the author did. It's a very long book and it didn't need to be. Finally, the author falls prey to the worst sin in this kind of cultural criticism: she treats her worldview and personality type as the perfect ideal. There was no honest acknowledgement that her era had any flaws, only lament that the world doesn't live more like she used to, that generations will not experience what she did as a child. I very much believe that there are real dangers with only a few companies controlling the information access to the world. I've personally experienced challenges with this (Amazon just recently removed me as a listed seller of my own books, saying I need to sign up for the next level of account--at more cost--before I have the chance to be displayed as the owner of the product again). But it's a mixed bag and the author can't see past her indignation to the true complexity of the situation.So, read this for an imbalanced, overly wordy way of getting one side of the story. If it's not this book, make sure you get both sides of the story, not just the story told by Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon, etc."

Today the same practices meet little resistance or even discussion as they are routinely and pervasively deployed on the march towards surveillance revenues.”Welcome to a new and daunting landscape awash with sinister terminology like “permissionless innovation”, “digital totalitarianism”, “reality mining” and “behavioural surplus”. This is the new apparatus that dictates how we move through much of our lives, and just like most architecture out there, after a while, you almost become oblivious to the secret workings and dimensions which are influencing your behaviour and actions. And this is how the boys and girls down in Silicon Valley like it best.“The image of technology as autonomous force with unavoidable actions and consequences has been employed across the centuries to erase the fingerprints of power and absolve it of responsibility. The monster did it, not Victor Frankenstein.”Zuboff touches on many aspects surrounding surveillance capitalism, and we see the intimate relationship between the NSA and CIA and the mutual benefits to that relationship. “The agencies craved the lawlessness that a firm such as Google enjoyed.” We learn the huge significance of Section 230 and how far behind the US is behind the EU in terms of clamping down, one example being the EU law in May 2014 enforcing the right to be forgotten. She cites many sources, but without doubt the two most prominent reference points are the work of B.F. Skinner and Hannah Arendt and in particular her “The Origins of Totalitarianism”. “Google is to surveillance capitalism what the Ford Motor Company and General Motors were to mass-production-based managerial capitalism.”At one point the author sets out the four main areas of fortifications that have allowed Google to be so over protected and free to flourish away from political interference for so long, particularly in the USA,1.	Google showing their capabilities of competitive advantage in electoral politics. 2.	The deliberate blurring of public and private interests through relationships and aggressive lobbying. 3.	A revolving door of personnel who migrated between Google and the Obama administration, who shared mutual interests during Google’s crucial growth years of 2009-2016. By April 2016, 197 individuals had migrated from government to the Googlesphere and 61 had moved in the other direction. 4.	Google’s campaign of influence over academic work and the larger cultural conversation, which was vital to policy formation, public opinion and political perception. “Ford’s inventions revolutionised production. Google’s inventions revolutionised extraction and established surveillance capitalism’s first economic imperative: the extraction imperative.”This book is awash with horror stories befitting of sci-fi paperbacks. Like the one concerning Genesis Toys, who brought out, My Friend Cayla, a terrifying concept in which the child’s doll which relies on voice recognition, also harvests all sorts of data from the customer’s house. It is such a blatant violation that in 2017 Germany, (a country which knows a thing or two about surveillance), banned it as an illegal surveillance device, urging parents to destroy any such dolls in their possession.Due to the nature of this book it does have its harder going moments, but it still remains engaging, and overall Zuboff has completed a chilling, sagacious and damning book on the sinister and sophisticated ploys increasingly used in surveillance capitalism. The text is relatively, devoid of any superfluous academic verbiage, which many of these kinds of books suffer from. These companies and the people tied up with them are the people who hate big, bad words like privacy, tax and transparency. You can employ all the lawyers, lobbyists and accountants and actuaries, but when you strip it all away, what it really is a small, group of dangerous people making the rules up as they go along who have been given a suspiciously free and easy reign over how policy works around the world.Facebook has already admitted to and was even boasting about its power to influence people’s behaviour in US elections, and this was years before the Cambridge Analytica scandal broke. The billionaire owner of that company, Robert Mercer, backed Donald Trump. As Facebook is a private company it did not have to adhere to the legal standards for experimentation required of academic and government researchers. It remains to be seen what Facebook and Google cannot get away with. Providing a vast platform for hate speech, fostering chronic bullying, screening live suicides, streaming acts of terrorism. Where will the line be drawn?...Like bold, bratty toddlers they constantly challenge their boundaries and throw tantrums when anyone dare speaks out, but they needn’t worry a succession of US governments has them well protected as long as that money keeps on coming.Every law, rule or regulation is only as strong as the loopholes allow it to be. If these loopholes are known and continue to exist then we must ask why that is?... Who has the power to close them and more importantly why have they chosen not to close them?...These companies have consistently and effectively been left to self-regulate with predictable consequences. The problems have been known about the Wild West mentality of the internet for many, many years now, but yet little meaningful change has occurred, especially in the US.“Facebook’s $4.6 million in donations during the 2016 election cycle complemented its lobbying budget of $11.5 million in 2017.” But this is nothing compared to Google, which repeatedly spends more on lobbying than any other corporation, shelling out more than $18 million in 2018. It is also the second wealthiest registered lobbyist in the EU. Why are Facebook and Google choosing to spend such astronomical amounts of money?...What must they be getting in return?...What do they want?...What do they get?...Why are we not being told?...Welcome to “American Democracy”. Be afraid, be very afraid…"
75,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50996552-jp-beaty,4,"A really important text for digging out the political import of the data economy. I think the writing is slightly clumsy and I think the book underestimates the connection between Silicon Valley firms and the intelligence services/ the state. I also find the substantive responses to the issue to be a little milquetoast in comparison to the problem she diagnoses (I suppose that’s how it ended up on Obama’s books of the year list). Those problems aside at its best it is a searing look at the logic and function of the data economy. For understanding the ways that big data firms are altering society and how to think about the use and abuse of technology, this is a great book. It’s really at its best at the most conspiratorial and will leave you suspicious of what exactly your phone is doing and what Facebook ultimately wants. I’m sure posting this review will trigger a whole cascade of advertising material to make sure the big social media giants don’t loose my constant stream of crumbs I feed them. Don’t worry amazon algorithm reading this, I am much too trapped in the Skinner box to act on the suspicions raised by this book."

It is not a coup d’etat in the classic sense but rather a coup de gens: an overthrow of the people concealed as the technological Trojan horse that is Big Other”.This book is a huge, impressive piece of work. It feels like a relief to (at least) get some sort of overview over the way in which surveillance capitalism dominates our lives and orders society, despite the lack of suggestions for solutions. Understanding is the first step towards any form of meaningful resistance, and this feels like a solid first step :-)I do wish it were more accessible (as I do with most political theory) as its message feels like something that needs to be heard by more people than those who are willing to read 500 pages worth of academic language.Also - Zuboff’s idealization of the Henry Ford-era of capitalism rubs me the wrong way."
77,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24266382-ashley,3,"It’s been called “visionary,” but I don’t know that there’s anything entirely new here. What this felt like, to me, was a call to attention. The reader is not surprised by anything Shoshana Zuboff outlines, but is rather forced to acknowledge the problem in its entirety, all at once, in a 500-page package. That does make it feel revolutionary; Zuboff has written what very few people are willing to discuss in mainstream media, but which everyone has an inkling of, one way or another. I did find that it was a little too long-winded. It could have been significantly compressed, especially when a lot of the material was repetitive in order to emphasize certain themes and vocabulary.... and her preoccupation with B.F. Skinner was unnecessary. Zuboff was never so brilliant than when she illustrated, specifically, how Facebook and Google and Samsung (among others) are driving our behavior for their own profit, frequently at the expense of the law. I think that this strength was often drowned in vocabulary lessons and meandering observations, coming across as a little self-indulgent somewhere around the 200-page mark. It was unnecessary to spend so much time explaining Zuboff’s coined terms, such as “the uncontract”, “unprecedented”, “radical indifference”, “behavioural surplus”, and even “surveillance capitalism” itself. Especially in Part III, Zuboff’s self-indulgence became a running tangent, entire sections devoted to philosophy (and biology) lessons on the concept of “free will” and “utopia.”  In spite of that, it has definitely changed the way I think. It has also further fueled my nostalgia for a simpler time, and my distrust of social media and big corporations. The fact that it’s near-impossible to escape the clutches of these corporations is what really keeps me up at night; it’s not so much a privacy issue (I couldn’t care less if Mark Zuckerberg gets access to my old Instagram photos of cappuccinos) but rather a question of ethics. If I don’t want to give my data to third-parties, why are they able to access it anyway? If I don’t want to contribute to the rise of Facebook or Google, why are they still able to profit off of me anyway? Consent doesn’t really enter the conversation when it comes to what these rich tech companies have in mind, and evasive, incomplete privacy policies are nothing but “placebo effects” to pacify users.  Yes, I’m aware of the irony of publishing this review to Amazon-owned Goodreads.  ""Surveillance Capitalism"" is the kind of book that makes you want to throw your laptop into Lake Ontario and live in a cabin in the woods. I don’t know that I have the gumption for that kind of drastic change, but I’ll definitely think twice whenever I consider downloading an app or signing up for e-newsletters; I will certainly avoid buying any new smart devices by whatever means necessary. I do think it’s time for us to start protesting the free-reign that these conglomerates have been given, especially in North America. Our own behavior is being observed and herded by the rich 1% for financial gain; everything from our spending habits to our complacency is being mediated and controlled. I think, eventually, we have to reclaim our sense of autonomy and identity, and our understanding of reality.  Also, I just want to state for the record that I’ve always found it odd how North America experienced a period of mass rebellion, political protesting, and unrest during the 1960’s and 1970’s – and that this unrest suddenly came to a complete stop, save for a few exceptions here and there. Well, Zuboff has justified my unease, dedicating a sub-chapter to the behavior-control research conducted by the US Senate in the 70’s – research which became urgent as political protests escalated. And yes, surveillance capitalism has everything to do with it.  At the end of this heavy volume, Zuboff was really only trying to say one thing, re-stated from multiple angles: we are being rigorously and continuously exploited by capitalists. We don’t own our behavior anymore. Data collection and behavior control for the purpose of financial profit has crossed all ethical boundaries, and we as a society are content to let it happen.  This book is definitely recommended, if you have the patience and endurance to get through it. I almost didn’t. In a similar vein, I also recommend watching ‘Smithereens’, one of the recent Black Mirror episodes. Despite its melodrama, I think it has a lot of important things to say on society’s need to be “plugged in” and how this addiction is driving our lives. Some of Zuboff’s quotes that will stick with me: -“Its products are about predicting us, without actually caring what we do or what is done to us.” -“As populations grow numb, it becomes more difficult for individuals and groups to complain.” -“[Cortana] wants to know everything about you, but it does not want you to know how much it knows [...]” -“ ‘The most profound technologies are those that disappear. They weave themselves into the fabric of everyday life until they are indistinguishable from it.’ ” [-Mark Weiser] -“Contemporary reviewers of Kahn’s book invariably seized upon the dark ‘nightmare scenarios’ of the computerized surveillance theme, the science-fiction–like forms of control that, they assumed, ‘will be actively feared and resented by many.’ Despite the wide range of scenarios that Kahn presented in his book on the distant year 2000, Kahn’s voyage into the ‘unthinkable’ was viewed by the public as a way to prepare for ‘the worst possible outcome’ in a terrifying ‘nightmare of social controls.’ Yet now, that same nightmare is rendered as an enthusiastic progress report on surveillance capitalism’s latest triumphs.” -“[…] Google wants us to accept that its rules simply reflect the requirements of autonomous processes, something that people cannot control. However, our grasp of the inner logic of surveillance capitalism suggests otherwise. Men and women made it, and they can control it. They merely choose not to do so.” -“Many people feel that if you are not on Facebook, you do not exist. People all over the world raced to participate in Pokémon Go. With so much energy, success, and capital flowing into the surveillance capitalist domain, standing outside of it, let alone against it, can feel like a lonely and risky prospect.”"

79,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85785571-laurence-lai,1,"The title “The Age of Surveillance Capitalism” evokes a weighty subject, and the book’s subtitle purports to something menacing to the future of humankind. It is to be seen if its contents are as substantial as the book’s 700-page length would suggest.The author, Shoshana Zuboff, is a professor emerita at Harvard Business School, not unimpressive an honor by any measure. A summary of assertions made in the book is as follows:1.	Big technological colossuses (Big Techs), epitomized by Google and Facebook, operate their business models by extracting data trails of online users, and in turn selling the extrapolated results (what Zuboff calls behavioral surplus) to their advertising customers.2.	Sophisticated algorithms are deployed and constantly refined to increase the predictive value of profiling data. At the same time, online users are passively served with moderated searches, federated news feeds, suggested connections, etc., all under the coercive power of the Big Techs. Such duress is as severe as not only to affect, shape, and compel, but with the aim to modify and manipulate user behaviors.3.	With the proliferation of sensors and Internet connectivity, Big Techs extend their reach far beyond the virtual realm to the real world. Regarding the surveillance operated by these techno-capitalists, in the author’s telling, its presence so pervasive and its impact so complete that any human free agency has receded entirely to the background and is ineffective.4.	While the above are not new to anyone who has casual understanding of current economics and culture, what Zuboff strives to accentuate is their connection to high-order issues such as self, liberty, democratic values, and human nature. She compares the dangers posed by “surveillance capitalism” to that of fascism, totalitarianism, behaviorist utopianism, and the like, that once presented real or potential detriments to humanity. For its thrilling effects, the agenda for the book is sweeping, even ambitious. Technological advancement, especially one that combines deep analytics, machine intelligence, and makes its ubiquitous presence in our intimate lives deserves a dispassionate evaluation as to its social impacts. Zuboff should be applauded for selecting this timely topic for her book.Yet one cannot help but feel frustrated by the lack of thematic organization of the whole book. Instead of explicating the economics involved in this different “capitalism”, Zuboff is more concerned with weaving her own narrative of abstruse euphemisms about how grave a danger the human future is facing. Materials are regurgitated, often word for word from the earlier part of the book and throughout. As to what actions Zuboff suggests to “fight for a human future…”? The author offers an ill-defined “synthetic declaration” (p. 345), and a skimpy, equally obscure advice of “friction, courage, and bearings” (p. 524). Specifics are sorely lacking in allusions to democratic institutions, public opinion, legislative and judicial recourse (p. 520). A whimper of a solution indeed to a loud bang of such a doorstopper.Zuboff obviously sets out to intend the book as a treatise that plumbs the depth of these to her as “unprecedented” developments in “surveillance capitalism”, and attempts to compare philosophically with past phenomena its manifold menaces to humanity. But it is exactly in such philosophizing that is the weakest of the book, for her arguments are at best tenuous and strained. On the other hand, the author wily limits her subject to mostly the socio-economic domain of the Western world, as is indicated in the book’s title. The picture would have been more complete if it had combined with surveillance authoritarianism. The “social credit” system practised unimpeded in China makes only passing reference in mere 6 pages (pgs. 388-394). Certainly, the threat to human liberty and dignity is far graver when the surveillance apparatus and capability are controlled by a police state, whereas in Western democracies competition among capitalists still exists. What is most infuriating is Zuboff’s penchant for fabricating catchphrases. Smug expressions such as “dispossession”, “behavioral futures”, “cultural misappropriation”, “economy of action”, “division of learning”, “shadow text”, “uncontract”, “hive”, “coup from above”, “Big Other”, “instrumentarian power”, “right to the future tense”, “third modernity*” …., litter throughout the book. The meanings of many of these are poorly articulated. Although she attempts to provide a brief rationale to her epithetic acrobatic (p. 66), such twisting of language is unnecessary and far from successful. It is an act of throwing spaghetti upon the wall; hoping that somehow one such phrase may stick with posterity with reference made to the author. As stated, the impression appears that the writer is more interested in weaving an esoteric narrative than presenting facts. Read a typical sentence on p. 488 of the book:“No exit” is the necessary condition for Big Other to flourish, and its flourishing is the necessary condition for all that is meant to follow: the tides of behavioral surplus and their transformation into revenue, the certainty that will meet every market player with guaranteed outcomes, the bypass of trust in favor of the uncontract’s radical indifference, the paradise of effortless connection that exploits the needs of harried second-modernity individuals and transforms their lives into the means to others’ ends, the plundering of the self, the extinction of autonomous moral judgment for the sake of frictionless control, the actuation and modification that quietly drains the will to will, the forfeit of your voice in the first person in favor of others’ plans, the destruction of the social relations and politics of the old and slow and still-unfulfilled ideals of self-determining citizens bound to the legitimate authority of democratic governance.” Long sentences can be beautiful in abler literary hands, but the above is downright egregious in form and meaning. Zuboff’s writing style can be aptly depicted as beating around the bush, with hyperboles and a plethora of inapt metaphors that ill befits so serious a subject she wants to convey. At times, she relishes so much staying with her metaphoric vehicles that the intended tenors are nowhere to be found. Long, winding sentences with chained substantives also further hamper readability.So, are readers more empowered at the end “with a more cogent and comprehensive understanding” (p. 18) of the menacing incursion exerted by the Big Techs? For the newly initiated, the writing style has done more to obfuscate than to illuminate. For the more inclined and those who look for some concrete societal antidotes, Zuboff has woefully under-delivered. More clear-eyed analyses are still awaited on the technologies proffered by the Big Techs, on the associated data-driven economy, and their consequent impacts to individuals and society at-large. * cf. Alan de Vulpian, 2003 (English , 2008)"

83,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4679583-myles,3,"This week my company officially got into the business of surveillance. People will pay us to surveil their home and business computers to protect them from rogue computer software, from losing data resulting from defective or aging components in their computers, and from misguided management of their computers themselves.Going forward this will be a growing and lucrative business segment because people rely on their computers to do so many important things for them, because they feel inadequate keeping up with changes in the computing environment, and because they justifiably fear cyber crime.It doesn’t mean they like it. I sure don’t.Being in retail business as I have for almost 25 years I have learned how to surveil myself, to protect my assets, and my employees. It is an ongoing challenge and it changes. I surveil for shoplifters, for currency and credit card counterfeiters, for daylight and after hours thieves. I surveil for dishonest employees, for honest mistakes, for poor buying decisions, and for the obsolescence of the products on my shelves. I surveil how the bank handles my money. I surveil my suppliers to prevent them from shipping me incomplete or broken goods. And I pay attention to my customers, to save them from making poor purchasing decisions.And when I am not surveilling, I am surveying. All the time. How were my customers’ experiences? What new products are on the horizon? How can I protect my liquidity, my profitability, and lastly, my sanity.I especially surveil myself, because I make mistakes, and because I too am growing old.These are some of the risks of operating a business.Then there are the people who surveil me. They include thieves looking for a weakness in my security. Government agencies to make sure I am paying the eight or ten different taxes I pay on an ongoing basis. Credit card companies surveil my transactions to make sure somebody hasn’t stolen my credit card, or that I am spending no more money than I can afford to pay back. My suppliers make sure I am paying them on time. Some manufacturers visit me in person or electronically to make sure I am representing their product lines fairly. They send me electronic training, and tests, and they regularly measure the efficiency and quality of our repair facilities. The utilities tell me when my operations (and home) are inefficient. And there are my landlords.Finally, we surveil at home. We surveil our daughter to make sure she is doing her homework and not falling in with the wrong crowd. My wife surveils me to make sure I’m not overeating, overspending, or being overly attentive to other women. I surveil my dog Seamus just in case he poops on the neighbour’s lawn so I can pick it up before someone notices. And Seamus surveils the front window and barks whenever a neighbouring dog saunters by. Last and not least are the gargantuan corporations who are watching what I do online. People like facebook, Google, amazon, and many, many more.So when somebody writes a book to tell me I live in an Age of Surveillance Capitalism...I GET IT! REALLY, I GET IT!But is it uniquely capitalist, or more generally an age of surveillance?And if it is more general to our society, where do we go from here?One thing for sure: it isn’t going away anytime soon.Shoshana Zuboff concentrates her guns on Google and facebook. She’s concerned that these companies are inherently different from the companies that came before it and they set a new standard for egregious capitalism. They are companies in the prediction business, predicting human behaviour and right now largely predicting purchasing behaviour by accumulating, as she called it, “surplus behaviour,” which kinda sounds like an oxymoron. She believes they abuse the freedoms of the marketplace to frustrate privacy, that they are built to enrich few and sidestep the traditional workplace which pays many employees fairly and creates consumers, and she argues that they are indifferent to social ills.She argues that Adam Smith’s “invisible hand” doesn’t operate in this marketplace because the new knowledge capitalists know everything happening in the market.A close reading of Andrew Carnegie’s life and legacy, perhaps John D. Rockefeller as well, could lead you to a similar conclusion, even though both men turned to philanthropy later in life. For sure, these men affected the course of capitalism.Is this a turn away from “good” capitalism toward an inherently evil capitalism?And if it is evil, can we create some rules for the big guys that us little guys can live with?Let’s take a step back and look at things in context: Google’s revenue is about $25 billion, Facebook’s $17 billion. The entire US economy is about $25 trillion and the world economy upwards of $107 trillion. Most of Google’s and Facebook’s revenue is advertising. The US advertising market is upwards of $80 billion so it is fair to say these two firms command quite strong positions in this industry. If you make the argument that America’s advertising industry is too concentrated then you’d have a pretty good argument to break up these firms which combined represent about 50% of all advertising dollars in the US. By comparison, Standard Oil at its peak commanded 88% of the market for processing crude. In its first year of operation, US Steel produced 67% of steel produced the the US.And they exhibit the classic behaviour of monopolists by dominating the markets for search and for social media on a global scale.In the US a case for breaking up the firms traditionally would have to be made that consumers are paying too much for their services or that competitors are being kept out of the market. Maybe breaking up these firms is a good idea, maybe it isn’t, but either way the technologies they employ for gathering, and analyzing, data isn’t going away.When I worked as an auditor, we used to gather lots of data, too, but what we eventually learned was that we could make assumptions about its meaning by sampling the information; that is, we cut down our work by only looking at some of the data. We tried to cut down on the wasted time. I sometimes wonder how much of what Google does is a total waste of time because the answers it seeks can be found in much faster time using much less data. And how much of “Big Data” is in fact a “Big Waste of Time.”Zuboff doesn’t consider that these firms may still be just in the early stages of figuring out what they are supposed to be doing. I think about it because so much time and resources are wasted paying attention to wholly irrelevant stuff.But we would do well to consider the affect of these companies on our freedoms and our government partially because they aren’t just national problems. They are transnational problems. What happens in China, and the extreme kind of surveillance practiced there on ethnic minorities like the Uigers, affects or will affect us here.They are transnational because the data collection is transnational and the very same data collected for the purpose of selling advertising is probably being used to develop artificial intelligence. The fastest developer of AI whether they be Chinese companies, transnational companies like Google or Facebook, or companies directly financed by government will have a big say in who has a job in the coming years and who doesn’t.No country on its own can hope to curb data collection and aggregation or perhaps more importantly, the control of what search results reveal on this scale any more than a country can curb money laundering, tax avoidance, or climate change without coordination between many if not all nations. Contemporary politics seems to be going in the opposite direction if Trump’s “America First,” Brexit, and Russian adventurism are any indication. If we are divided and our attention fractured we are susceptible to the influence or real or imagined “experts.” (To firms like Facebook I think we all have ADD, attention deficit disorder...they can never get enough of our attention!) That doesn’t mean we cannot continue to make decisions affecting our government, it more likely means that the decisions we make will more commonly resemble the imperatives of those desiring more of the same, read: the status quo.And that turns us to the question of how good is the status quo. If you believe that the universe ultimately bends toward the dilution of energy, total entropy, then the status quo is not too good. If you believe the status quo to be a teleological evolution toward a great singularity, perhaps a union with God, and a progression toward greater complexity in the universe, the status quo looks pretty good.Business executives, in my experience, tend to be of the more optimistic latter type of people. Like the Mark Zuckerbergs of the world and other people who have become incredibly wealthy in a short period of time.In the meantime, some of us have rather pedestrian concerns like the security of really private information. While convincingly arguing that there is insufficient transparency over who handles the big data and how they handle it, I think Zuboff fails to sufficiently weigh immense risk that the data will fall out of control of the aggregators and into the hands of rogue individuals.The hacking of credit card databases is one thing, and I think it a bigger risk than the hacking of a database which tells people how I like my hotdogs dressed. People made a big deal of the Cambridge Analytica scare. In the end, those people sold bogus claims to naive political organizations. The data predicted nothing and was of no use to anybody. And it didn’t get Donald Trump elected.Certainly big data aggregation has concrete effects on the economy. You get “free” Google searches. I get a cheaper smart TV because the data guys get first dibs on my TV watching preferences.This book is not the best guide for the good works these technologies enable (ie crowd sourcing, scientific research, epidemiology, etc). Self-driving cars benefit by machine learning. The acceleration and reductions in the friction in electronic commerce are generally good things.I don’t agree with Zuboff that the behavioural science behind the new data aggregation firms promotes a radical indifference to the lot of the common person. Nor do I agree that hyperscale doesn’t require competitive markets or for that matter democracy.This has yet to be proven.We all need participatory democracy, and more than ever on a global scale. Let’s make these damn machines work for us, not agin us."
84,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26854448-m-a,5,"This is a brilliant and important book about the future of mankind.It is unfortunately very difficult to read, due not only to the complexity of the subject matter, but also due to the constant use by the author of jargon and long complicated sentences. This is very ironic, considering that this book is intended as a warning and a call to action to the general public against the machinations of the Surveillance Capitalist elite. I can only hope that a more accessible version of this book will be published to accomplish that goal.Zuboff claims that surveillance capitalism is as big a change for our society as industrial capitalism was more than two centuries ago.It all started with Google, followed closely by Facebook, Microsoft and eventually by all digital industries.Google started collecting our private data (from our search terms on Google search, to our emails on Gmail, to our location data on Google Maps, our data stored on our Android devises etc..) without our knowledge or consent and turning them into predictions about our future behavior, which they sold for profit to marketers.Zuboff calls Google ""privacy kleptomaniacs"". She compares Google to the Spanish conquistadores invading the natives on the American continent and declaring the continent theirs by a monarchical edict declaring it so. So did Google invade our private data by declaring it theirs through obscure unilaterally imposed terms of service.She calls this data, the new raw material of capitalism ""Behavioral Surplus"".She traces the architecture of this new form of capitalism from its supply routes to its ""behavioral futures markets"".The production of digital data has far outpaced the human capacity to process/make sense of that data.Therefore, behavioral psychologists and data scientists have created algorithms to predict an individual's future behavior based on the billions of raw data of his/her every move and every thought.They use the 5 factor personality model, the 6 emotion model, affective computing, emotional analytics and sentiment analysis to predict our personalities and our future behavior.Surveillance Capitalists are prediction factories, based on raw materials from us.Google and co don't sell the raw data, they sell behavioral predictions based on that data.That information is not only useful to marketers, but to anyone with an interest in that knowledge and an interest in influencing that future behavior.Some examples of benefits of knowing a person's future behavior with very great accuracy include: predicting disease, financial risk, criminal risk, consumer preferences and political views. This knowledge about the future allows corporations to eliminate all risks in their business dealings.Zuboff calls this predictive data the ""shadow text"".This shadow text is only available to surveillance capitalists through their data extractions and algorithms.It is about us but not for us.Us being unaware of the surveillance is the precondition for surveillance capitalism to function properly- we are to remain unaware of the shadow text. Even if raw data are shared with us, the shadow data crafted for prediction purposes is not accessible to us.Remote digital observation and tele-stimulation ( the ""god view"") allows for distancing of the observed as ""the other"".Zuboff calls the Surveillance Capitalists the ""Big Other"".""The market reduces us to our behavior, transformed into another fictional commodity and packaged for others' consumption"" We are to be monitored and tele stimulated.Zuboff demonstrates how surveillance capitalism has expanded beyond cyberspace into our everyday life.Even the human body is treated as a computer, containing data in order to provide corporations certainty of profit.Take wearables for example: they form an unobtrusive integration to everyday life- internet connected fabrics, fitness trackers, diabetes apps etc.Zuboff quotes a study that shows that apps downloaded on a smart phone extract location data, contact lists, photos & videos etc without express consent of the user and that they sell this data to third parties.According to Zuboff, these companies' privacy policies should be called ""surveillance policies"".She predicts we will all end up with chips in our bodies for better surveillance, like animals. Telemetry is already used on animals to study their behavior. Humans will be next.We are already tracked in our cars, in our homes, in our kidneys (dialysis devices).By 2020, there will be 20 billion intelligent devices with the capability of tracking and monitoring us.Zuboff calls whatever data that is not yet tracked ""dark data"". Surveillance Capitalists are intent on tracking all behavior that is not (yet) informatized.They want to monetize every aspect of our lives, the entire human experience. They want to turn our entire life into profit for themselves.Power was once identified with the ownership of the means of production.Now power rests in the ownership of the means of behavioral prediction and behavioral modification of the other. Now our lives are turned into data without our knowledge or consent in order to benefit others.Zuboff explains how the system of Surveillance Capitalism is grounded in behavioral psychology.The goal of behaviorism is the prediction and control of behavior- the human being is nothing but an organism, an ""it"". According to behaviorists a human is in essence no different than a mushroom, only a bit more complex.Behaviorists (eg Skinner and Pentland) believe humans have no freedom of will, no autonomy, no agency. Freedom of will is an illusion. It is the environment that controls behavior. Individual behavior is caused by variables lying outside the individual himself.Hence the belief by behaviorists that behavioral control can lead to predicting future behavior with scientific accuracy. Behavior must be studied w/o limits and w/o knowledge of the ""organism"".Privacy is an illusion just like freedom- they must be forfeited in favor of the good life.BUT this view was meant to benefit all of humanity; the knowledge gained through behavioral tracking was to be used to improve human behavior towards a better future for humanity: fighting disease, crime, poverty etc..Instead, behaviorism has been hijacked by surveillance capitalism to benefit only the small class of surveillance capitalists and their customers. The lost freedom only affects us but the acquired knowledge and profit is all theirs.What are the dangers of Surveillance Capitalism?The more one knows about a person, the easier it is to control him.Besides being used for targeted marketing, knowledge of personal data can also be used to blackmail, defame, harass and discriminate against us.The dangers lie not only in corporate surveillance itself and the accompanying loss of privacy, but even more worrisome, in corporate mind manipulation and corporate behavioral modification, such as the creation of conformity and obedience but also the creation of desires that benefit commerce and emotions that benefit politicians. Surveillance capitalists wants ALL of you- your behavior, your thoughts, your emotions, your personality- so they can manipulate your behavior. Will you have any autonomy, any free will left? Surveillance Capitalism is not only a danger to privacy, but a danger to democracy which depends on autonomous moral judgment and individual determination and free will. Zuboff believes in free will as the basis for individuality, self determination, and the right to decide our future (She calls it ""The right to the future tense"").The right to be one's author of one's future should be cast as a human right-necessary because it is imperiled by ""the panvasive digital architecture of behavioral modification owned and operated by surveillance capital, necessitated by its economic imperatives and driven by its laws of motion, all for the sake of its guaranteed outcomes""Will Google, FB and co. lead to digital totalitarianism? According to Zuboff the answer is no, because the past offers no adequate compass for this new phenomenon.Zuboff calls the future of Surveillance Capitalism ""Instrumentarianism"".Totalitarianism, as impersonated by Hitler and Stalin was only understood after the facts. It entails the destruction of all human ties except total loyalty to the movement (fascism or communism). It operates through the means of violence, terror and fear- all who do not conform, the enemies of the ""people"", are executed.Instrumentarianism behaves through the means of behavioral modification.And, unlike in a totalitarian regime, there is no need to use force . All you need is adequate human engineering.""Instrumentarianism"" is a behaviorally controlled society, in which knowledge replaces freedom. In such a society, social change can be generated by social pressure from social networks to ""go with the flow, stay with the herd, return to the hive and take flight with the flock"". Identity yields to synchrony.Such a society leads to the death of individuality. The collective intelligence knows best and individuality is only unnecessary friction towards that goal.Instrumentarian society with its architecture of behavioral control, social pressure and asymmetrical power is a Panopticon - there is no exit possible.Once it was believed that there is no exit from an all knowing and all powerful God.Under Instrumentarianism, there will be no exit from the others, big other and the surveillance capitalists. Big Other knows no boundaries.Zuboff pleads for the right to sanctuary.It is a universal need for a safe refuge, for shelter.This right is as ancient as human history; originally it manifested itself in the form of a city, or a temple. Later on this right extended to the home: a sanctuary from arbitrary intrusion. Psychologists agree that this is important for development of the self and for mental health. With Big Other, the Universe takes up residence within our walls, there is no refuge. (thinkof internet connected security cameras, light switches, thermostats, appliances, rumbas, wearables,smart phones, tooth brushes, beds, personal assistants, TVs, toys,etc etc).What solution does Zuboff propose to avert the coming Instrumentarian Society?To just stop using the internet and internet connected devices?Surveillance Capitalists offer solutions to social connection, access to information, time saving convenience and ""illusionary"" support and this got us all addicted. It is not reasonable to expect us to go off the grid.Privacy regulation and monopoly regulation is inefficient at combating those risks- it will not be solved by encryption, anonymization or discussion of data ownership. This is a new condition that outruns the law, that has not been tamed by law. Zuboff discusses very briefly the new regulatory regime operating in the EU since May 2018, the GDPR ( General Data Protection Regulation). The GDPR is a good step forward, but only time will tell if it will be efficient in vanquishing surveillance capitalism's instrumentarian power. The individual is powerless against the surveillance capitalist machine because of asymmetrical power and knowledge. Only collective action on the ground, such as class actions, will determine if GDPR will be effective.Regulators will be up against well funded corporate lawyers and lobbyists.Zuboff concludes that Surveillance Capitalism is profoundly anti democratic. It is a market coup from above on the people. It is a form of tyranny, of absolutism; it imposes its rules from above; everyone except the tyrant is just an organism, the ""other one"", to be exploited for the profit of the tyrant.Industrial revolution has led to near destruction of our planet and extinction of many species. Instrumentarianism will lead to extinction of our individuality.Zuboff points to the critical role of public opinion on changing the laws. She proclaims passionately:It is NOT ok to strip search us for profit.It is a human expectation to be the author of one's life.There is still time to redirect the action to a future that we can call home.It is our responsibility to right was has gone wrong.We have to be indignant because this is an attack on human dignity.Freedom from uncertainty is no freedom.She refuses to seed the future to illegitimate power.She demands a human future.She calls the world to action to declare the digital future to be a human future."
85,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42693079-ryan-o-neill,4,"This ambitious and expansive book aims to define and explain the rise of surveillance capitalists like Google, Facebook and Microsoft as they play ever larger roles in our lives. Shoshana Zuboff briefly maps out the history of some of these companies and delves into the way in which they gradually encroach on our lives in ever more frightening ways.She argues persuasively that while sometimes driven by old capitalist imperatives, these companies represent a break from past eras such as that of industrial capitalism as they secretly and aggressively gather increasing amounts of personal information from us, but not for our benefit; rather than the traditional business-customer reciprocities, surveillance capitalists plunder every element of our lives, both online and offline, for the benefit of advertisers, and ultimately serve their economic benefit.Under surveillance capitalism, we are no longer the customers (although practices are often disguised under the auspices of 'personalisation') but rather our searches, browsing history, friends, likes, reactions, emotions and feelings are raw materials to be scraped for the benefit of companies who are free to operate outside the boundaries of traditional democracy and regulation. Our rights are ruthlessly and carelessly cast aside and rendered obsolete in this relentless pursuit of behavioural surplus without which surveillance capitalists cannot grow.These companies encroach upon our personal space in ever more intrusive ways - from the original Google Street View controversy in the mid-2000s to Facebook's hidden methods of gleaning info on our preferences, to TVs that listen to you, wearable devices, Alexa house alarms and even toys that listen to you, to the fight for our car dashboards. The speed and aggression is such that after initial outrage, we are worn down, helpless and numbed, resigned to our fate.Surveillance capitalism, Zuboff argues, attempts to create certainty of outcome for its actual customers - its advertisers. This is done by parsing human behaviour, exploiting feelings, emotions and beliefs even when we don't permit it to, so that our individual freedom, our rights to define our own experience, and to act and think in private are eroded as we are continuously moulded and directed towards specific courses of action by these companies. The inherent uncertainty that exists within how we think, how we act and interact - our right to an effective life - is replaced by collective certainty at the hands of surveillance capitalism.Zuboff also mines the effects of social media on young people's development. As they journey from being defined by their relationships at a young age to becoming separate from but connected to others in adulthood, young people are adversely affected by social media and its imperatives to forcing people to see themselves 'from the outside in' and define themselves based on the experiences and lives of others. The pervasiveness of social media means people often struggle to disconnect, their mental health even suffering from brief separation from their accounts. This crucially and savagely inhibits their ability to look inward and make that journey from people defined by their relationships in youth, to autonomous individuals who have relationships in adulthood.Zuboff argues that while the advent of new laws such as GDPR in Europe have been helpful, surveillance capitalism's overall success in evading proper regulation and legal scrutiny means that decisive action will depend on a turning of public opinion. Lots of us are passive about our distrust of social media, but it will take a re-establishment of indignation, a renewal of outrage, if we are to have any chance of stemming the flow.The book is a heavy undertaking; more than 500 pages long and often written in rather academic prose, and it can occasionally be quite dense and abstract. Given the ubiquity of technology in all of our lives, it could undoubtedly be more reader-friendly, and perhaps focus on more real-life examples that we are all familiar with. Despite its wealth of information, Xuboff's proposed solutions are vague, and it is arguably unclear what exactly you as an individual can do personally to reduce the insidious influence of surveillance capitalism in your everyday life; what strategies can be used to repell Facebook from building a strong profile based on your preferences, for example? Is there a feasible path to effective life without being on Facebook?Furthermore, it would have been helpful to have some more analysis on the gathering of information not related to economics - the how and why of information kept either by governments or corporations on citizens for reasons not linked to monetary benefits.Nevertheless, this is a hugely informative, well researched and important book on a subject which, as the author herself notes, is a story still unfolding and which still has some way to run. It's likely that many updates and more reader-friendly analyses on surveillance capitalism will follow, but this is a fantastic launch-pad for one of the defining issues of our time."
86,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45700308-tanmay-srivastava,1,"Shoshana Zuboff's book was highly recommended, was part of multiple lists and had glowing reviews on Goodreads. I was quite excited to pick it up and start reading.  Without calling it out, Zuboff treats incremental technological progress as a zero sum game. A win for the tech companies is a loss to someone. Take, for example when Zuboff talks about connected cars . She says an insurance company can stall a car if the premiums are not paid. She beats up this argument and brings up a case of how an elderly couple had to choose between car payments and medicine, which came to light only when the collection officers turned up at the door. A crowdfunding campaign was launched to help them and it had a happy ending. Using software however would have meant that this would have never happened. She fails to recognize that her example is the exception and not the norm. She chooses to ignore the positive impact connected cars would have on say, cars getting stolen going down leading to lower premiums or reduced premiums for drivers using their cars less or rewarding good drivers by reducing their premiums. Maybe, with such technological advances premiums would fall to such an extent that the couple wouldn't have to worry about premium payments altogether? She fails to acknowledge that progress is not a zero sum game. Tech companies have been bashed quite a bit through the book. There is no nod of appreciation for the positive impact they have had on societies. Here, In India - products of these tech companies are helping small businesses make moves that wouldn't have been possible before. Expensive POS Machines have been skipped (the same way how landlines didn't make it to parts of India but mobile phones did) in favor of Google Pay (QR Codes for Bank to Bank transfers). Book keeping doesn't required expensive licenses and can be managed online. Whatsapp is used to sell/communicate/deliver orders. YouTube is a learning platform for many, and a medium for news outside of the traditional media. The jobs these tech companies have created in India, directly and indirectly, also cannot be overlooked. There's a section where Zuboff talks about fake news and its impact on Brexit and the 2016 US Election. While I do agree fake news is a very big issue, the issue of voter discretion cannot be overlooked. In Zadie Smith's essay on Brexit -  ""Fences""  she writes how someone voted one way in referendum to get rid of the health secretary. Would it have been different if it was not targeted to a particular group (via the likes of Cambridge Analytica)? Would the results of Brexit and the 2016 US Election have been the same if there was no Facebook? Are we giving these incidents more importance than they deserve? ""Who knows?"" - I don't. I don't think we can ever conclusively state yes or no. The biggest issue is that a lot of topics covered in the book are in the grey area. Is it okay to give someone hungry a burger from McDonald's? The burger will make sure that they don't go hungry, but it's not a healthy meal. Can they afford to have a healthy meal? Can they stay hungry? Is there a way to grow healthy food to feed everyone? Is there a way to make everyone want/enjoy the healthy food? This sort of reasoning should have been the core of the book. You cannot do without technology companies today. Google, Microsoft, Facebook are essential parts of our day to day lives. Is there a business model where these companies can make enough money to create products that add value without compromising on data to drive revenue? Is there a market for people to pay for their services without any data getting collected? Do people bother to dig deep in their account settings to switch off optional data collection? Do people care? I feel the book is not asking the right questions needed to drive policy discussions. Data privacy is an important topic. The book is well researched in parts but jumps into pages of wishful thinking. The conclusions drawn are biased. The facts are presented in a way to scare you, and similar to how likes are garnered on social media with scary/angry posts, this book has scared people into giving it 5 stars on Goodreads. I wish this book was not one sided as it was - Not recommended."
87,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27470888-cool-breeze,1,"The subject of this book is very important. Unfortunately, this book fails miserably at contributing anything useful to the discussion. It is mind-numbingly long at 691 pages and an ordeal to read. Zuboff takes a few observations on surveillance technology issues and uses pretentious academic jargon to fluff them into this execrable doorstop of a book. The book does not offer any practical solutions to the issues she raises. A good editor could have reduced this to a pamphlet or a web article without leaving much notable out.This is possibly the worst non-fiction book I have ever read. I dreaded resuming it every time I picked it up and finally abandoned it on page 158. If I should ever be stuck on a desert island with only this book for reading material, I will be thankful at least that I have an abundant supply of toilet paper.Zuboff is a sociologist and the language she employs is tortured and tedious in the extreme. She insists on coining lots of neologisms and wallowing in her jargon. Amusingly, her favorite term is Behavioral Surplus, or BS for short. The book could have saved countless pages if she reduced a lot of her BS to abbreviations. Perhaps such Heideggerian writing impresses her academic colleagues, but it is excruciating for the average reader. She beats her core points to death – within the first 100 pages she must have repeated some version of the following point dozens of times – ‘the user isn’t the customer, nor are they the product, they are the raw material that is used to create the product’. You could have cut many more pages by limiting this point to three repetitions. It is as if she thinks her readers are idiots, or else she has dementia and doesn’t remember what she wrote a page or two ago. Even worse, Zuboff is a Luddite and a hard-core leftist. She obviously thinks the Industrial Revolution was largely a disaster. On page 11, she writes “industrial civilization… threatens to cost us the earth”. By page 12, she is hyperventilating “The industrial legacy of climate chaos fills us with dismay, remorse and fear”. No, it doesn’t. The reason Trump is President and the US has repudiated stupid climate treaties is that so many American voters think this is a non-issue or a very low priority (#18 out of 19 in a recent survey). On page 22, she writes that she has been inspired by a rogues' gallery of leftists, including Karl Marx, Theodor Adorno, Jean-Paul Sartre and Thomas Piketty (Robert Reich and Rachel Carson, who is responsible for millions of deaths, are also mentioned favorably). On page 33, she likens her great-grandparents fleeing the oppression of 1908 Russia to the oppression of the nuclear family (you poor, fragile snowflake!). On page 38 she viciously criticizes Friedrich Hayek and Milton Friedman, although she admits their policies pulled the country out of the stagflation and “malaise” of the Jimmy Carter years. Unbelievably, Zuboff apparently thinks airline deregulation was a bad thing. On page 42, she is writes approvingly of rioters in London (she really should read some Theodore Dalrymple on the real problems involved) and the dilettante, astroturf Occupy “movement”. On page 43, she comments disapprovingly on those who would “pare regulations, cut taxes… and shrink entitlements”. Heaven forbid that anyone should want to take an ax to the leviathan state! By page 109, she is bemoaning the Supreme Court’s rejection of restrictions on political speech, “hate speech” (meaning anything she and her politically correct brethren disagree with), pornography (yeah, she’s puritanical as well as a Luddite) and free association. What a pinch-faced scold!Only at this point does she admit that her arch-villain, Google, has been totally in bed with the left-wing Obama administration, using their surveillance technology to mastermind his two Presidential campaigns and running a revolving door operation with 258 employees moving between Google and the Obama regime. Whoops! How inconvenient! It’s almost like leftism and this creepy surveillance technology go hand in hand! Curiously, in a 691-page book, the word “Clinton” does not appear even once in the 26-page index! I wonder who was President from 1996 to 2001, Google’s first five years? Or who was Hillary’s biggest corporate campaign contributor? It is a complete mystery, according to this book. Zuboff doesn’t actually appear to be a Clinton fan, so maybe she just doesn’t want to wind up adding to the Arkancide body count like Jeffrey Epstein.Zuboff must have felt terrible about documenting the extent of Obama’s collusion with Google’s abuses, because within a few pages she is back to bashing mainstream conservative organizations such as the Federalist Society, Heritage Action, Americans for Tax Reform and the Cato Institute as “Far Right”. Anyone to the right of Marx, Lenin and Mao is apparently “Far Right” to Zuboff.Chapter 5 elaborates Googles expanding abuses from 2009-2016. The Europeans attempt some pushback, but the US is feckless or oblivious. Just who controlled the government that was supposed to be preventing such abuses during this time? Zuboff couldn’t possibly guess, even if you spotted her an O, B and M. During this period, Zuboff’s Harvard Business School colleagues ride to the defense of Yelp, perhaps the only tech company more loathsome than Google.Strangely, Zuboff admits there were a number of potentially effective policy fixes being seriously considered in the years before 9/11. Why not revive those ideas and build a political coalition of like-minded classical-liberals, libertarians, small-government conservatives and Trump supporters (the tech giants being no friends of Trump) to implement them? She points out that the national security agencies are obstacles. Well, after Brennan, Comey, Holder and Lynch, a lot of people on the right need no further persuasion that the FBI, CIA and the rest of the Deep State are utterly corrupt rogue agencies. Zuboff doesn’t appear to consider this a possibility. I guess working with those icky right wingers is completely out of the question. Even worse, such allies are never going to go along with replacing the tech elite with the “benevolent” socialist dictatorship of Zuboff and her Harvard faculty elite. As it turns out, Zuboff’s problem is not so much with the creepy technology, it is that the creepy technology is not under the control of “enlightened” leftists like her and her comrades in academia and government.That was as much as I could take. I skimmed the book for any sign of practical solutions in the pages to come and, finding none, I abandoned the book on page 158.I agree with Zuboff that the tech giants represent a grave threat. However, if her prescription of more government and more socialism is the only alternative, I guess I will just have to find ways to live with it. The only thing worse than surveillance capitalism is surveillance statism run by socialist do-gooder “elites” like Zuboff, who always think they know better and want to engage in social engineering. Do you think the Chinese people would prefer annoying Google ads or their oppressive and ubiquitous social credit scores? The only people I would less like to see in control of this technology than Page, Brin and Zuckerberg are Zuboff and her comrades.In the nearer term, there are still practical steps one can take to mitigate the problem. Don’t use Google products. Use DuckDuckGo for search. Don’t use Gmail or Chrome. Use a good ad blocker, like AdBlockPlus on all devices. Don’t buy creepy surveillance technology like Nest, Ring or Alexa. Delete your Facebook account. Don’t use Twitter, it’s a surveillance sewer. Don’t buy from Amazon or use their products or services, especially the Washington Post. Don’t buy from Apple or use their products or services. Use Linux if that is viable for you or lock down you Windows privacy settings, if not. Check your app setting and cut them back to only those necessary to function. Don’t use non-essential apps like games, many of which are bad offenders.Support the breakup of the tech giants using antitrust laws. Support their prosecution for anti-competitive and anti-privacy violations. Having Page, Brin, Zuckerberg and Bezos doing some serious hard time would have a very salutary effect “pour encourager les autres”. Institute real and legally-binding privacy protections such as Zuboff mentions and dismisses. Yes, we will have to do it without the support of Zuboff and her comrades, but Trump’s upcoming second term could be a real opportunity to get this done (I think Zuboff’s head may have just exploded)."
88,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65435043-alan-tennyson,5,"I pored over this book, stayed with the words. Read and reread them. Drank deeply from their wisdom.  It was not an easy read, but ultimately it gave far more than it took. The Age of Surveillance Capitalism is a seminal text for our age. Zuboff's account of surveillance capitalism is elegant, poised and persuasive. Yet for all her brilliance, Shonanna's central thesis suffers some fundamental flaws.  Where The Age is at it's strongest is in the articulation of surveillance capitalism. Consider this, 'Who owns your face?', 'Who owns your behaviour?' What you do, where you go, who you know, all this has value and extracting value from these data is the business model of the surveillance capitalist.  But this is only the description, where Zuboff's account takes a darker turn, is in control. Once Surveillance Capitalists have provided a description of you, the next logical step is to determine how much this description can be used to predict and control you. Zuboff's account of these processes is beautifully rendered in perfect proses.  Know thyself, unless you don't like what you find, then, deny thyself, and pretend you are other. Zuboff goes for the latter.  We are born of this place, this pale blue dot, we are natural phenomena. Yet despite these self-evident truths, many continue to advance the notion that we apes are exceptional.  We are somehow other than the mere organisms with whom we share our earth and almost our entire genetic structure. Zuboff takes issue with humans being described as 'mere organisms'.  She is caged by this ideology of human exceptionalism, and it weakens her thesis considerably.  There are sacred cows here, and sacred cows will invariably be slaughtered.  The first heifer into the meat factory is autonomy. Shoshana strips us of our relations, our context and connections. She exalts 'autonomy' but fails to grapple with the weakness of the presumptions it contains. This leads her to assert that humans are and ought to be autonomous.  But Zuboff fails to address that we are born free, but everywhere in chains. From the traffic light to the electric chair, we are already in a context that seeks to control our behaviour. What does she think education and justice are? If not systems of changing our behaviour? But it's more than this, it's a scientific reality, we are our contexts, our environment, they shape us as we shape them.  This is a reality that an insistence on 'Freedom' cannot wish away.   For me, the issue is not that we are organisms', we are.  It is not that we are miraculous rational deities, we are not.  We need to embrace our human frailty, stare it down since we are wiser for this knowledge.  Here again, Zuboff takes issues with what she calls the 'ideology of human frailty'.  Respectfully I would ask that we,  put down our pride and look hard in the mirror, human frailty is not an ideology, it is a fundamental truth. We are 'mere organisms' and to claim anything else is to cling to a pernicious ideology. An ideology that has prompted human dominion over earth and animals, and all the ecological genocide that follows."

In fact, in a time like this I wish there was a more complex rating system than 5 stars. I digress.This was, in many ways, the first of its kind. There have, in my view, yet to be too many intelligent take downs of the dangers of big data. There is,of course, a brief mentioning of the a similar subject in many other modern texts - but not to this degree.So, you ask, what the hell is surveillance capitalism. It is, a term coined by the author. She first presented the concept publicly in 2014, in an article, where she described it as such :""[surveillance capitalism is a] radically dissembled and extractive variant of information capitalism"" based on the commodification of ""reality"" and its transformation into behavioral data for analysis and sales""*---- IN this book she presents the story of how it is that we have gotten to such a point in history, where the sentence in her 2014 article could even be spoken. In this she gives a small run down of facebook and google, and explains the origins of these sights in relation to their users. User-ship on these web pages began without much craziness, but as we all know many pages which were once small e.g. facebook, google, and youtube have more or less all become huge power houses of influence. They have now followings in the billions. This is presently praised by these web pages as a good thing. Initially. well. The servers couldn't take it. There was too much damn data. And its all so useless.Or is it?It was, with this question, in the eyes of zuboff, that this form of capitalism** was born. The data not only need not be an annoyance, but it could be a pathway towards making money. 'Perhaps', these tech giants thought 'we could predict the users behaviors by paying attention to the patterns in data'. Alas. we are truly all creatures of habit. Long story short. A great deal of people in the industrial world are using certain pages on the internet in ways that are useful for targeting for sales. This of course can eventually be sold to governments blah blah blah. Ask yourself. are you ok with people predicting your behaviors to increase user experience? What about to protect you? What about to just watch you?These are questions the book will make you reflect on.Overall, I think this was one of the most apropos books I have read in awhile towards understanding some issues in modernity.86/100 stars.Recommended for:Those thinking about big data in its prediction of human behaviorthose who dont trust facebook and googlethose worried about internet privacythose thinking about the future path of society*Hey guess what. IM gonna source wikipedia :https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveil...**Call me a peasant or an uneducated bafoon. I think the word capitalism is hardly ever used where it should be. Perhaps im wrong."
90,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2157293-john-fredrickson,4,"This is a massive tome, and took a long time to read. One of my principle complaints against it is that it could/should have been considerably shorter. The author's writing style is one the things that make this hard to read - the writing is descriptively quite florid, while at the same time speaks in broad abstract terms. Sentences abound with references to totalitarianism, instrumentarianism, industrialization, etc. Usually, a writing style like this would make me suspect that the message being conveyed would be too high level (therefore lacking in any real substance). This is absolutely not the case here. The book is well thought out, broad in scope, but strongly and densely detailed in the examples chosen. It is just long, and often difficult to follow.Surveillance capitalism references the new normal (this 'normalcy' is a major concern throughout the book) of businesses (e.g., Google, Facebook, ...) that use data that people generate in their web interactions to satisfy their real customers, other businesses, all the while hiding the level of personal data that is being used. Smart TVs, sensors throughout homes, and electronic personal assistants all work to gather data that is convenient for the public, but profitable for a select few. A couple of sentences from late in the book summarize the overall thesis nicely: ""Industrial capitalism depended upon the exploitation and control of nature, with catastrophic consequences that we only now recognize. Surveillance capitalism, I have suggested, depends on the exploitation and control of human nature."" The notion of how this new business model extends into control is one that is touched on throughout the book.Zuboff takes the reader through a journey that introduces the surveillance concept, then puts this definition into context by exploring the nature of capitalist business through the age of industrialization. She also goes into the nature of totalitarian regimes, and talks about what it means to resist social forces, either as a young person trying to individuate while remaining somehow cool and relevant in the Facebook universe, or as an adult merely resisting social norms (quoting numerous psychological studies, including some of the Milgram experiments).Zuboff claims that  surveillance capitalism must be reckoned as a profoundly antidemocratic social force. I agree, and think this book has a lot to offer. This short review leaves much of the book unaddressed. The book is worth reading, but definitely plan on spending considerable time with it."

The possibility of permitting Apple and Google to launch protocols for covid contact tracing via our mobile phones is a fascinating test case for the warnings Zuboff sounds. Of course the refutation there is that this is an extraordinary moment in which the loosening of privacy for broader health and safety is a reasonable trade-off. Zuboff’s chronicle of the increasing presence of technological tracking and data accumulation surrounding each and every facet of our lives, makes the case that we would be wise however to take closer look. Tracing the rise of what she terms “surveillance capitalism” from the early aughts, Zuboff notes the role Google and its heaps of data played in facilitating the government’s honing of various anti-terrorist data collection programs and processes. The force of the argument is that Google (and other firms, Facebook, Microsoft and Amazon are cited, but Google certainly receives the vast majority of focus), not only acquires data from Android, search, Gmail, Maps, Chrome, Youtube, smart speakers, Photos application, Nest thermostat, and so much more, but that this data, as well as that from the vast majority of websites and social networks that we visit, are increasingly being used to improve the efficacy for the very ads that drive Google’s financial success. Google improves this efficacy by leveraging data to employ more directive influence on consumers. Zuboff highlights the high velocity at which these developments happen, and the resistance Google and other companies use via political contributions and action, marketing, and insistence on the necessity of data collection for the conveniences their services provide. She notes that user agreements we sign are nearly impossible to process (even Supreme Court Justice John Roberts confesses to not reading them) and that they permit data tracking and distribution that we should reject. Parallels with China’s social credit score system are made, and if one grapples with what’s already taken place, especially as evidenced by US insurance companies creeping towards setting rates based upon inputs from our online histories and social networks, are not hard to envision taking hold albeit in corporate rather than government-rendered permutation. Much of Zuboff’s writing lays out framework, and while reading I wished it included illustrative examples a bit more prominently, the pace of change, and arc of the issue, and desire for this to be a guide for future conversations around surveillance capitalism and data privacy bring that approach into more clarity. "
92,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7008502-anita,5,"Professor Shoshana Zuboff has been like a smart, annoying carpool member who never shuts up, differs with me on many premises, including basic definitions, but with whom I am in strong agreement with the PROBLEM of surveillance capitalism. It took about a month to finish this on Audible at 1.25x speed for my 30 minute drive to work. The last 8 hours of listening time I carried my phone non-stop around my clinic when empty and around house listening to the last hours of Shoshana's Bad News. I am sure if I had a hard copy of the book, I would have thrown it with great force on more than one occasion and for a few different reasons. As it was, I permitted myself to allow her words and information wash over me, with certain parts of the book jumping out and grabbing me by the throat. Such as: We have a right to the future tense. We have a right to sanctuary. These are things the surveillance capitalists seek to invade. Her term instrumentarianism to describe the consequences of those surveillance capitalist operations which threaten individual autonomy and democracy is as useful as it is chilling. Finally her pointing out the emotional stance of the surveillance capitalists towards the rubes who provide behavioral surplus is astute and devastating: radical indifference. But there's also real contempt and I so long for some real comeuppance to those masters of the digital universe in my lifetime. As I type this I'm watching a talk by Sandy Pentland who I'd never heard of before this book. His blithe use of prediction markets and the stealing of our data to provide it affirms Professor Zuboff's thesis. He thinks he's doing good for the world. He loves the latitude he gets in China to accumulate data. I am so creeped out. I have listened to her interviews on podcasts and watched her speak on YouTube. Her voice is warmer and more pleasant than the reader of the audiobook, who sounds pissy and mean. It is a long book, I don't have time for a long review, but I can say The Age of Surveillance Capitalism is the most important book I have read in years. This, with Jaron Lanier's 10 Arguments for Deleting your Social Media Accounts, should guide citizens and consumers in demanding something better from Big Tech / Big Data than what we're currently getting.I would love to read a review by someone much smarter than me who is educated more deeply in free market economics and technology review her book - someone like Robin Hanson or Jeffrey Tucker. In any case, read it, think about, be influenced, and let's advocate for data rights. No one could have predicted this direction and it's not to late to influence the course."
93,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11001033-andrew,2,"I was very excited to read this book, and it contains some very interesting information and ideas. But ultimately, it is let down by poor communication and the author's inherent bias.This book aims to unveil and circumvent the practises of the surveillance capitalists who are collecting swathes of personal data for private profit. Based on mentions within the books, these capitalists roughly equate to 70% Google, 20% Facebook and 10% others including Amazon, Apple, Vizio and Mattel.What is clear is that1) these companies are collecting tremendoes amounts of our personal data2) they collect more data than they need to deliver the products and services we get in return; the rest profits them in other ways3) they go to tremendous lengths to protect their access to this data including political lobbying at the highest levels, obfuscated privacy agreements (it is estimated that if we were to read all the legalese for every software and device we use, it will take up several days of each year), funding supportive academic studies and fighting lengthy legal casesThere are also quite a few anecdotal accounts of how people have suffered embarassment or inconvenience as a result of the way these companies used data without their consent (e.g. the poor guy who was interrupted in his shower because Pokemon Go players wanted to catch a pokemon in his yard).The tone of the entire book is one of righteous indignation, and this is the first issue I take with it. The author assumes that the reader agrees with her that what the tech companies do is entirely bad. However, apart from a few extreme examples, she does not make a convincing case why we should object to them taking our data. In contrast, I am personally willing to part with some of my data in exchange for many of the useful products and services these companies provide, and while this book lays bare that they are probably taking too much data, I personally find that some of the predictive tools they provide me in exchange are useful, and I am also mindful that if they don't take my data they might demand money instead; and maybe I'd rather they just take my data. These are tradeoffs that the author fails to acknowledge or discuss.But the biggest problem is that this is a 700- page book that reads like an academic journal in dense academic prose because it is written by a Harvard professor, who probably thinks this is normal. To exarcerbate matters, she decides to further invent a new vocabulary to convey her ideas, and we are deluged with words like ""habituate"", ""dispossession"", ""behavioural surplus"", ""rendition"". Instead of lengthy explanations of each one, perhaps she could just have used simpler words.Overall, I think this is an important book to read, to better understand what the big tech companies are doing to get your data. I hope someone comes up with an abridged version soon, because that could probably deliver 90% of the value in 25% of the words."
94,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19487217-maija,4,"An important, but long-winded read that ends up being less impactful than I’d expected, as it never seemed to get to its point, though it might be because of some of the following reasons. I’m familiar with AI ethics issues, so some of the points and legal issues brought forward here weren’t new. I’m also familiar with the technical aspects, so I guess I’m missing out on some of the astonishment. Perhaps more significantly, I feel that the authors stance on free will is different than mine. The free will debate may be ongoing, but it is far from scientifically controversial to say that many (if not all) significant aspects of a persons’ behaviour are shaped by factors outside of their control. Therefore, numerous passages quoting a bunch of tech giants saying something along the lines of how they’ll build a world where Alexa lives in your spleen and manipulates you into buying endless supplies of tchotchkes and druid outfits from Wish doesn’t seem far fetched. If anyhting, I find it more disquieting because they might succeed. What’s more, these tools aren’t going away, and I feel the book missed an opportunity to highlight how much benefit behavioural surplus could yield if it were used for some other purpose (only one was brought up in the whole text), and what an absolute travesty it is that it’s being used for some variation of the above example. All of these wouldn’t be significant issues if the author didn’t list adjectives or adverbs in threes what felt like every five minutes. What information I learned from the book was useful, I only wish it were not surrounded by dramatic descriptions of Spanish bakeries. That’s just a personal preference on style which I prefer for journalistic writing (and it might also have to do with the fact that I listened to this as an audiobook), but I felt the book was too wordy, and as a result, the arguments seem obfuscated to me. Despite all this, I’m definitely glad I listened to the book: it provides a good discussion on a topic that is currently important, and brings up some good points to ponder, so I’m giving it four stars. Even if you don’t agree with the analysis, it provides a lot of information on IoT, tracking, data collection etc. that everyone should be educated about."
95,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/79677049-rafael,5,"This is essentially a research work—and a great one. Arguably too long, but great nonetheless. It alerts us to the problems we might already know about or think we know, as well as to the risks we're facing and their consequences. It's a little bit like global warming and other environmental issues, and the author actually uses similar references to the past and the history of humanity to explain how and why we got here.Along the way, we're faced with real examples of abuse of our right to privacy and dignity, and exploitation of our personal data and lives. Frankly, everyone should learn about these. I thought I knew quite a lot about the shady business that is going on in the online world, which has already started to traverse into the 'real' physical world, and yet I was still shocked to read most of the stories and research that has been published.An important aspect about this book is that the author has started to give names to the tools, patterns and concepts that define this age of surveillance capitalism. Although hard to grasp and relate to in the beginning, they somehow start making sense as you keep reading and learning more about them. I think this is important because having names to describe things is the first step to understand them, give them visibility and empower people with the language and tools they need to tackle the problem.It was disturbing to learn about influential, powerful academics and businessmen who are determined to put an end to our democratic systems and our human individuality, creativity, dignity and right to privacy and decision-making. In fact, it's rather appalling, and I struggle to understand how they're not ashamed of the things they're saying publicly, let alone think them in the first place.As a member of a modern, democratic society and someone who works in the Internet and technology industry, I hope to be able to enlighten people and provoke some necessary change with my own actions and the ethics of the software I build. I urge everyone to read this book, get informed and demand the dignity and respect they deserve. It's time to end this nightmare before it ends our societies and humanity."
96,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/107983927-patrick-millais,3,"5 stars for the content. This is an incisive examination accurately describing the transition of an economic system that destroys nature, to one that destroys human nature. It provides a smart framework around the exploits of large corporations – namely market-forces driven around behavioural surplus and guaranteed outcomes, with catastrophic effects on individual autonomy. For the analysis alone – particularly on instrumentalism and frameworks detailing how big tech companies operate – this is a super timely and important read.My issue with the book was that it felt like reading a PHD thesis. This is a LONG book. The prose is often repetitive and incredibly dense, to take an example: ""'No Exit' is the necessary condition for Big Other to flourish, and its flourishing is the necessary condition for all that is meant to follow: the tides of behavioural surplus and their transformation into revenue, the certainty that will meet every market player with guaranteed outcomes, the bypass of trust in favor of the uncontract's radical indifference, the paradise of effortless connection that exploits the needs of harried second-modernity individuals and transforms their lives in to the means to other's ends, the plundering of the self, the extinction of autonomous moral judgement for the sake of frictionless control, the actuation and modification that quietly drains the will to will, the forfeit of your voice in the first person in favor of other's plans, the destruction of the social relations and the politics of the old and slow and still-unfulfilled ideals of self-determining citizens bound to the legitimate authority of democratic governance""A single sentence! It's near impossible for readers to hold this much content in working memory, parse it, process it, and then reflect on the meaningful points which the author is absolutely making. If you can stay engaged and get past it, it's worth it. The book is a crucial analysis – and I suspect in years to come also a seminal analysis – of socioeconomics and the world we are part of."
97,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/142949-heidi,2,"Summary: There were a few good points here - particularly in the chapters involving the redefinition of privacy and identity and the young, but also in the recognition of societal changes and the expansion of the market realm. Unfortunately she buries these good ideas in terrible analogies, obfuscating language and a continuous stream of insulting comparisons. I generally agree with the idea that marketing and advertising which subtly encourage purchases, reframe the idea of normal, and change a person's impression of the world around them is a problem. She puts this forward as if it's only the tech companies doing that, which would be a minor quibble, but the way she frames it turns me away from even that concept. And beyond all the problems with the content she uses way too much specialized jargon. Long Version:Surveillance capitalism can be summed in the combined ideas of ""If you're not paying for the product, you are the product"" and the ""nudge"" systems popular in recent behavioral economics. She's talking about the persistent growth of monitoring systems and the increasingly effective ways tech companies are able to target and influence user actions. She calls this ""the right to the future tense"" as we increasingly don't decide what to do or what we want but live in systems where the choices are increasingly false - they're hidden behind the dopamine hits we're getting from phones and social interactions which are algorithmically chosen in order to influence actions to someone else's request. And that's a great point which she hides in a large analogy of Conquistadors and violence that I found very offensive. Not just as a former techie, but as someone who sees a difference between large scale rape, murder and enslavement versus offering an addictive and troublesome service. The commodification of everyday behavior and the marketplace of people who attempt to influence that behavior are important changes to the capitalist model, with likely impacts on democracy and everything else that people do, is a central idea here that gets repeatedly hidden by violent comparisons in a book that is explicitly about these non-violent concepts.She repeatedly focuses on 3 questions: “Who knows?”, “Who decides who knows?”,“Who decides who decides who knows?” and those lead again into interesting discussions of class and the new capitalist markets. I think the fight for a human future lies in making the answer to those questions be humans, but it's a weakness of the book that she is so busy with detrimental rhetoric that it's hard to focus on the actual discussions of behavior and response. She uses B.F. Skinner's ideas to discuss the idea that there is no such thing as free will - we are all conditioned in myriad ways, and with sufficient knowledge we can predict the behavior of others based on that knowledge. The tech companies have been monitoring our social circles and consumption enough to gain a large quantity of that knowledge and the explosion of monitoring capabilities inherent in the Internet of Things and Smart Cities continues to grow that knowledge. The further loss of free will discussed here is that the same companies have increasing control - and here is where she goes into some of the more frightening possibilities when discussing identity formation around social media. Again, good concepts that are buried by the way she uses cued language. The final strong argument she makes is the growing disconnection between consumer and producer - comparing the ratio of employees to users at a hyperscale company like Google to the ratio at companies like Ford. This likely will have frightening long-term consequences but she doesn't go too deeply at that question. She discusses the concept of 'instrumentarianism' which is a deeper idea that could have it's own book, but is something like the political idea of the inevitability of these practices because these tools exist. It also has some elements of the dehumanization of people through being looked at as the producers of data and the tools that need to be manipulated to produce a designated result. Ok, credit given, now I'm going on to deeper discussion of the problems with the book. She explicitly says that what Google is doing through monitoring and data collection is the same as what Columbus did to the Taino people. She compares Facebook's manipulation of who shows up in the feed to Stalin's Great Purge. She says the tech concept of 'dark data' is where measurability of something becomes the only factor of value. And finally, worst of all in my opinion, she seems to think this all began with the digital world. The idea that violence is bad escapes this book- she equates showing you an advertisement when you're vulnerable to whips and chains. And she doesn't do this once or twice, she does it throughout the book. Personally, I do think advertising has gone too far and capitalist society does use debt entrapment in unfortunate ways, but this book makes me feel like a right-wing free marketeer. These trends of changing what we think of as normal began long before we had cell phones - television had been effectively modifying the internal worlds of people for decades before the founders of these companies were even born. The idea that only what we can measure has value is a basic concept around since the scientific revolution, and the idea that the person who takes those measurements has ownership rather than the people being measured has a long history in white people taking advantage of disadvantaged populations. Similarly she discusses the idea that 'Who Decides' is an increasingly limited answer because of the concentration of power at the top - as if this doesn't apply to oil companies or financial firms as much as it does tech companies. She discusses surveillance capitalism as if the digital world birthed all this bad behavior into the market rather than the market replicating it's bad behaviors more effectively through the digital world. She uses the jargon of both tech companies and political economists making it harder to read the actual good points, then uses violent comparisons which have a 'it bleeds, it leads' impact on the reader which further obfuscates the important ideas. I feel like I'm in the small minority who is familiar with both sets of jargon so I don't know how well anyone who isn't familiar with both political economy and the tech companies of the last decade could even begin on this book. On the one hand I hated this book, on the other hand I want to go through and systematically re-write it to be more legible, less name-calling and with a stronger voice to the books many good points. Maybe it is actually the editor I hate? She routinely cites Polanyi, Marx, Smith, Weber and Tom Paine and manages to be less readable than any of them despite the advantage of writing this now. Read by audiobook from the SF Public Library and Libby app. "
98,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61149517-matt-vargo,5,"Whew, this one was a whopper.....took me a while to get through this. This is a well sourced examination at the history and extent that corporate America, in cooperation with the government in many instances, has turned our society into Nazi Germany. Everything we do and say is monitored. The owners of that data are working towards means of behavioral modification based on that data. The worst example of this is our glorious president who was elected because Cambridge Analytica used extensive personal data to manipulate morons on Facebook. In a general election, you only have to manipulate 1-2% of the voters to change the outcome. That can be done by firing up idiots with AI scripted ""news"" written to stir up the worst in people and delivered to these people when the algorithm has identified the user as most emotionally vulnerable. The thing about privacy is that it doesn't really matter if you have anything to hide or not. Having one entity (or a handful) own 100% of the world's private information gives those entities extraordinary power. Historically that kind of power has led to totalitarianism. It is only a matter of time before this power ends up in the wrong hands. I've taken up the strategy of trying to confuse the AI. I'm pulling up fox news on occasion. I'm proclaiming my love of Trump while in the vicinity to these bastardly cell phones. I'm googling things like ""Why aren't we locking more mexican kids in cages?"" When they start rounding up intelligent people and putting them in camps I want to have a strong argument that I'm a good ole American first dumbass. "
99,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5950232-vittore-paleni,2,"This book, I think, suffers from a few major flaws. From the outset she decided to write from a personal key which has the following consequences: when engaging the subject from this POV, in attempting to carry the point through her own moral stance, she ends up sounding like a pundit, this is further enforced by her idiosyncratic terminology or slogans (e.g. ""who knows, who knows who knows, who decides who knows,"" a phrase repeated at least 30 times, one would trust the reader can get the point by the fourth time or so). Further, her personal style allows her to write baggy prose. I would have liked, and hoped, the argument would be a bit more well-structured. Instead I was met at many a time by what seemed to be well-meaning rambling. In short she constantly gets in the way of the subject/argument. It distracts. With a good editor I would think nearly a third of the book could be excised without any loss to her argument. If instead of rating books with stars, but with how many pages one thinks a book is worth, then this book is worth 300 pages or so, not the double that it is. Lastly, her conclusion due to its lack of concreteness and an aura of idealism fails to engage the enormity of the problem, leaving the read with with further well-trod slogans of ""we the people"" and ""true democracy"" or ""if the Berlin Wall eventually came down, then we surely..."" These flaws leave an uneven book that tries to be academic, personal (guru). In this case these don't mix very well. I would have wished much more of the former rather than the latter. In other words, I wish she would have made her point on the strength of her argument than the strength of her moral persona. Such effects make this a transient book, despite the recent acclaim.This is unfortunate because her subject matter is very important and urgent. If you have the patience it may be worth your while."
100,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5576926-david,5,"Zuboff offers outstanding analysis on surveillance capitalism, how it got here, and where it's heading. Be prepared for 700+ pages of scholarly rant.Rather than outline the major themes as others have done, I'm going to paste in a representative sample below to help you decide if this book's for you. This excerpt is on the topic of phone/social-media-based automated personality characterization:Personality analysis for commercial advantage is built on behavioral surplus -- the so-called meta-data of mid-level metrics -- honed and tested by researchers and destined to foil anyone who think that she is in control of the ""amount"" of personal information that she reveals in social media. In the name of, for example, affordable car insurance, we must be coded as conscientious, agreeable, and open. This is not easily faked because the surplus retrieved for analysis is necessarily opaque to us. We are not scrutinized for substance but for form. The price you are offered does not derive from what you write about but how you write it. It is not what is in your sentences but in their length and complexity, not what you list but that you list, not the picture but the choice of filter and degree of saturation, not what you disclose but how you share or fail to, not where you make plans to see your friends but how you do so: a casual ""later"" or a precise time and place? Exclamation marks and adverb choices operate as revelatory and potentially damaging signals of your self."
101,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/537000-brian,4,"Wasn't sure what to expect of this book after reading some reviews in adavance. Some spoke of airy, academic language and some mentioned being overlong. Certainly there is some of that here but I ultimately found it an important book and worth sticking with. It's main benefit is that it puts flesh on the bones of many things that lie out of sight - the digital infrastructures that mainly Google and Facebook have created that extract more of our behaviors than we realize, behaviors that help them create profiles of us that they sell to advertisers and other third parties. It is very much a social studies approach that attempts to dissect and give name to the logic that compels these companies to create more and more data points about us. It's about us getting our bearings after almost 20 years of being exposed to their products. What's their endgame as they evolve? She concludes that they are compelled by their own logic to extract more and behavioral data from us in order to guarantee predictable outcomes that they, in turn, can guarantee third parties. Do we really want to live in a society where we have tacitly consented to being surveilled in order to get some services? The contract is too asymmetrical, in her opinion, and bad for the human soul. We lose too much in whatever gains we supposedly get. We need to be aware of what’s happening so we can protect democracy and our right to our own future, not some mediated future where their prediction engines know us so well that they can subtly influence our behavior and guarantee outcomes to third parties for profitable gain.

102,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/115287832-miriam-glustein,2,"I'm not normally a fan of nonfiction, and this book perfectly demonstrates why: most nonfiction books express the content of a long newspaper article, but take 300 pages instead of 10. While Zuboff writes about relevant and interesting problems, she fails to answer two VERY important questions related to surveillance capitalism:1. Why is this a problem?2. What can we do to stop it or reduce its impacts?The first third of the book is about ""setting the stage for surveillance capitalism"", and this section is the reason I didn't give the book 1 star. It is very well-done, well-researched, and interesting. There are parts that genuinely surprised me.The remaining two thirds do not have these qualities. Many of Zuboff's conclusions are far-fetched (i.e. suggesting that Google knowing our data means we no longer have free will). Other conclusions seemed obvious - don't we all know by now that Gen Z is addicted to their phones? I was unimpressed with the content in these sections, but even less impressed with the writing. Zuboff uses loaded language and takes several pages to explain simple concepts. I felt that the last 200 pages of this book could have easily been expressed in 50 pages or less.If you're interested in this topic, I'd suggest you read some articles, watch podcasts, or even read a summary of the book - just don't waste your time reading 325 pages of sentences like ""What passes for social relations and economic exchange now occurs across the medium of this robotized veil of abstraction."""

I used to think that most of the problems with Facebook/Google etc were mainly to do with inadequate privacy settings, targeted ads, political propaganda... But the reality that Shoshana Zuboff uncovers is much more terrifying. Surveillance capitalism started when Google realised that their 'surplus' data concerning people's search history would be an excellent source of revenue - i.e. selling our information to advertisers. Now, every element of our lives online is scoured (location, click-through rates on ads, Facebook statuses etc), and increasingly our lives offline (smart devices in the home etc). Most worryingly, companies such as Google and Facebook are now working towards a model whereby they can modify our behaviour to 100% guarantee our choices in real life. Pokemon Go, which succeeded in herding people en masse into sponsored cafes/shops, was a warning of what is to come.Shoshana Zuboff examines how the system was created and what the social and political implications are for human freedom. Although the book is quite dense and academic in parts, it still is a riveting read. I felt towards the end there could've been more of a discussion on possible solutions, but hopefully she is saving for a sequel!For: anyone who suspects our phones may be listening to us In brief: DISABLE COOKIES"
104,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26042542-trang,3,"Well-researched, well-written, and overall an informative read. Some of the metaphors are quite over-the-top, for example, on how everything can be used as ""data point"" to learn about a user's behavior, Zuboff writes: ""The doll that was once a beloved mirror of a child’s unfettered imagination, along with all the other toys in the toy box—and the box, and the room that hosts the box, and the house that hosts the room—are all earmarked for rendition, calculation, connection, and profit.""or, on ignorance and free will:""The autonomous individual is but a statistical blip, a slip of the pen that is easily overridden in the march toward confluent action and someone’s greater good.""and my personal favorite, on our fleeting ability to resist the permeance of technology in our lives:""The theory indicates that opposition must simply be weathered as the signature of the first difficult phases of incursion. It assumes that opposition is fleeting, like the sharp yelp of pain when a Novocain needle first pierces the flesh, before numbness sets in.""What I didn't like: lots of setup for the history and formalization of surveillance capitalism, which for the most part of the book was painted through very cynical lens, yet Zuboff concluded the book with a bit of hand-wavy optimism that basically says ""Despite all that, we can resist"" while proposing few concrete actionable solutions. I probably wouldn't have gotten through this were it not for a weekly reading club. "
105,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29214879-matthew-eldred,2,"Zuboff presents a vitally important topic that humans need to consider as we continue to accept and adapt to technology in our lives. The book made for excellent fodder with our book club and we all walked away thinking more deeply and critically about the issues (of which there are many) she raised. I wonder whether most of the folks who claim to have actually read the entire thing actually did, because I barely made it. As many have noted, this book could have been 200 pages or less. It was repetitive. At places it went into too much detail and, all too often, it missed so much detail that it could be described as cartoon-ish. It was unclear whether she was writing for a sophisticated, well-versed audience on the topic or an introductory audience and that left the whole book disjointed. Worst of all, the book presents no solutions beyond ""BE THE FRICTION."" The lack of prescription was infuriating after traversing more than 500 pages with the author. TL;DR: Important topic. Too long and repetitive. Probably better books out there, or someone should write it because this misses the mark."

Behavioral surplus can loosely be described as the data produced when people use technologies like search, browsers, Android phones, and other Google products, knowingly and unknowingly. Privacy laws have fallen far behind the legal and PR capabilities of Google, and while there are benefits to Google products, our lives are no longer private. And in the future our desires, intentions, and actions may be subtly guided by Google in pursuit of a virtuous consumer cycle.The book appears well-researched and has a compelling and believable message. However, it is repetitive, verbose, and full of fear-based language that I stop reading. My recommendation: Read the first chapter carefully - really soak it in - and stop."
107,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7506732-bronwen-griffiths,4,"A hugely important book on how the big tech companies are taking over the future of humankind. I have to admit to skip-reading parts of it as the book is over 500 pages of dense text. I would like to see an abridged version of this book which would make it more accessible. However, it is incredibly well-researched and Zuboff has a real in-depth technical and philosophical understanding of how social media is not only mining our data but persuading us, without our real knowledge, to adapt our behaviour in the real world. I found the book quite pessimistic. Perhaps I am unwittingly (given the thesis of her book) unrealistically more optimistic than she is - as a social activist on social media I believe social media platforms can do some good - but then Zuboff's book does not delve into this. I recommend you read it - even if you'd don't read every page there are parts of it that will have you wanting to escape from your smartphone and your computer NOW. "
108,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/93344337-benny,4,"It is probably closer to a 3.5 to me but I am rounding it up to a 4 due to the fact that I think more people should read about the narratives that the book is trying to preach.I do understand the irony of writing a review of this book on a portal that is owned by a surveillance capitalistic company. That in itself is an example of how these new form of companies are entrenched in our daily lives. The poignant takeaway for me is that we have already given up too much of our data in exchange for convenience, and from the perspective of the surveillance capitalistic companies, advertising revenues. The battle lines are drawn. The balance of power is extremely asymmetrical. Big Tech companies have been making billion of revenues from the subtle clues that we sometimes involuntarily leave behind on the internet. Can we reclaim our privacy? Lamentably, this will be a continuous, protracted trench war between the people and Big Tech."
109,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40535995-leah,4,"This book explores the impact of surveillance capitalism in the economic, legal and cultural spheres, considers the notion of a ‘third modernity’ and makes a compelling argument about how technology and most notably Google and Facebook have encroached into our private lives. Zuboff makes some interesting observations such as the parallel she draws between surveillance capitalism and totalitarianism. She details Silicon Valley’s rapid rise to success and how behavioural modification was exploited in a post 9/11 world to erode privacy and work its way into every faucet of our private lives. This novel is extremely well researched, and serves as something of a warning. I feel that Zuboff slightly overstates the danger posed by surveillance capitalism, painting it as an immediate threat to our livelihoods, but this book is definitely worth a read, and provides some great food for thought. "
110,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49119883-muna,3,"The book is good at making a reader understand how tech giants, specifically Google and Facebook are breaching privacy and ultimately weakening democracy. The information presented are backed with references and the book is an outcome of proper study from the author. However, it was an arduous reading. The author starts with examples of how our privacy is breached by ""smart"" appliances or the example of knowledge gap or how democracy has become vulnerable, all leading to creating fear and anxiety followed by heavy use of metaphors to explain those examples, which could be a limitation on my part to make sense of what the author is trying to convey. And this process is repetitive in several chapters. The author's philosophical portrayal of problems associated with the rise in power of tech giants is coercive to readers and could be a reflection of fear from her studies. This is a book so I guess I can't only expect facts and figures here but the author's perception of the topic as well. "
111,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17108975-odi-shonga,5,"Let me cop to something right away. When people without large public profiles would express privacy concerns, I used to be one of those people who wondered why you should worry if you have nothing to hide. Nobody is likely to investigate you and, if you have nothing to hide, it won’t matter if they do. That was my thinking. This book tells you exactly why you should care, and does so with irresistible persuasive force. ‘The Age of Surveillance Capitalism’ has completely changed the way I view the large tech companies. The idea that we’re headed towards an instrumentarian ‘society’ — trapped in a bind of uncontracts, freedom permitted only if it’s perfectly predictable and manipulable — is both horrifying and fascinating. The notion that there’s a minority priest class with more knowledge about everything else than anybody else, and is perpetually and unfathomably enriched by it, is soul-crushing.But here’s the kicker: am I scared? Am I, like, deep-down personally scared? No, I’m not. For some reason, something fails to connect emotionally and I know I’ll continue using my Apple and Google products without paying deep attention to what I’m giving away. I’m informed now, yet I’ll continue to trade privacy for convenience. Paradoxically, this personal indifference makes surveillance capitalism’s iron grip on us all the more frightening."

How and why they continually ""mess up"" and over-expose our data and pay little to nothing for their mistakes. And just how they make money with all those free apps and games on cell phones.Hint. They're mining your life, tracking your movements via GPS, and browsing history, your text and phone call history, and often the content of your email and other communications in order to make millions marketing to you.

The question of who decides who decides the behavioral data will be used is an important question.Also interesting to note that many of the initiatives sited as example of abuses of Google's power turned out to be market failures and went away.Author is more left leaning than me, but I found her book to be important.

The acknowledgment that these companies are gathering ""behavioural surplus"" and appropriating it into ""behavioural futures"" provides a starting point for further discussions on beneficial reforms to us. Not the products of these services, but as Zuboff says, the carcasses discarded after all behavioural data is sucked from us. Yikes.It should be acknowledged that it is not perfect. The end of the book is not as strong and powerful as the beginning, the writing is almost overly complicated to a fault and there's a lack of an alternative viewpoint which, provided the booklength, could have been very useful.Still, Zuboff writes on a much needed topic as we're heading into an age of greater uncertainty as to the role of machines in our lives.

It is not an easy book to read, it is information dense, quite chilling and at times outright frightening and depressing. But it is very much worth it.

Sadly no one seems to care very much and there is little individual users can do to opt out besides going off grid. American courts are certainly not stepping up; the EU may be our only hope. The author likens these companies to European colonizers who blazed their way by taking people by surprise and then acting as if they were working for the greater good.One interesting topic was how some companies lure users to give up their data through incentives, such as car insurers that use dash cams to offer “safe driver” discounts.

There are many books that critique these subjects by such writers as Evgeny Morozov, Franklin Foer, Jason Lanier, and Nicholas Carr among others, but this transcends them all by putting the issues into a broader philosophical, political, and social-psychological framework. She sees surveillance capitalism as a devil's brew of Skinnerian behaviorism, digital and real-world surveillance, AI, and neo-liberalism dedicated to the end of monopolizing behavioral knowledge for prediction and behavioral control -- certainty -- to the benefit of the owners of the oligarchy of large digital companies. She calls this instrumentalism which see dissects in a way similar to Hannah Arendt's classic ""On Totalitarianism"" (she quotes Hannah Arendt extensively). The two systems - totalitarianism and instrumentalism - are very different in her view and are focused on different ends with different means. But she sees both as totalizing mechanisms of social control.I can't do the book justice in a review. Her ideas are far more complex than I have written here.

147,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65973528-ronald-diehl,3,"Where to begin?In Surveillance Capitalism, Shoshana Zuboff employs a strikingly varied repertoire of approaches to develop her arguments: she creates and refers to dense sociological theory, she presents matter-of-fact accounts of dubious corporate behavior, and she pours out long, emotional ruminations about the encroachments of digital technologies. This, coupled with the sheer number of sweeping claims she makes, makes it almost feel as if the only way to respond to the book in a comprehensive way is with section by section commentary.There are, however, some common threads to be found in her arguments—threads that if pulled, I feel, can unravel the weave of many of those arguments. Stated simply, I think that the conceptual arsenal Zuboff creates undermines her objectivity, I think she’s too emphatic in her rejection of technological inevitabilism, and I think she overstates the power of her corporate antagonists.I’ll start, though, with what I felt were the book’s merits.I think the work’s principal achievement is simply the identification and designation of the concept of surveillance capitalism. As connected devices have become ubiquitous, filling our homes and accompanying us everywhere we go, opportunities for data collection have become extensive. Corporations—the makers of our beloved (and apparently maligned) devices and services—have a clear economic incentive to attempt to capitalize on these opportunities, and they have. In some cases, the extent of this collection is so great and the process is marked by such a glaring lack of transparency and consent that labeling it as “surveillance” is a fair characterization. Zuboff illuminates some prominent techniques and practices in this domain, and she chronicles episodes of dodgy corporate behavior.While the book is in no way an exercise in consensus-building, she does identify a few phenomenon that I think cut to the heart of ethical dilemmas surrounding many contemporary digital technologies that involve data collection: privacy policies are often willfully disregarded, and terms of service agreements are often deliberately designed so as not to be read. That—everyone can hopefully agree on—is a problem.Surveillance Capitalism doesn’t conform to the common “problem and prescription” model that non-fiction books of this stripe often do, however, and the book is much more than a series of matter-of-fact case studies. It’s heavily theory-laden, and Zuboff goes out of her way to develop a strikingly large conceptual toolkit that she uses to construct her arguments, most of which are singularly pessimistic.Here’s an inexhaustive list of concepts that Zuboff either brings into being de novo or further elaborates as she sees fit:behavioral surplus, behavioral futures markets, Big Other, division of learning, dispossession cycle, instrumentarian power, right to the future tense, economies of scope, economies of action, division of learning, means of behavior modification, reality business, right to sanctuary, third modernity, will to will, surplus supply operations, extraction imperative, prediction imperative, surveillance revenue, surveillance assets, surveillance capital, surveillance policy, prediction products, Behavioral Value Reinvestment Cycle, rendition, and others I’m sure I’m missing.Zuboff is fundamentally reasonable and her arguments are largely sensible, but most of the conclusions she draws follow only from these concepts, or what in effect are axioms of her own contrivance. It isn’t as if she’s employing terms and concepts that’ve come to be widely accepted in the social and natural sciences—concepts that’ve been subject to a long process of discourse, scrutiny, and peer review, and have emerged with a veneer of veracity. Instead, she basically declares a host of concepts to be valid by fiat, and then uses them as grounds for sweeping (and dire) conclusions about the world. If one can challenge the validity of these concepts, the rigor of her arguments is seriously undermined.To explain what I mean, I’ll examine behavioral surplus, which is probably the book’s chief concept. If Marxist surplus value is the value of a product less the value of its labor inputs, behavioral surplus is the value of the inferences and predictions that can be made from data minus the product value originally derived from generating that data. The existence and validity of this concept is central to every part of the book.Zuboff frames all discussion of behavioral surplus with language such as “extraction,” “exploitation,” and “dispossession,” and consequently I don’t think it’s particularly difficult to cast things in a brighter light. At core, this way of looking at the notion of “surplus” is decidedly zero-sum, and it implies that all social outcomes of surplus supply operations and surplus capture can be accounted for by unambiguous gains for some parties being evenly equated with unambiguous losses for others. In my mind, it’s just as easy to frame notions of “surplus” as something akin to non-zero-sum gains whereby social and economic processes produce outcomes that are greater than the sum of their inputs, similar to Robert Wright’s thinking in his book 
Nonzero
. Along this line of reasoning, the non-zero-sumness that’s baked into most feats of social cooperation is a fundamental driver of social progress. When humans organize, cooperate, and produce novel artifacts, new information gets created, and this new information becomes an input into future organization, cooperation, and production, fueling the growth of social and economic complexity. That smartphones, search, and social media have ended up generating information (i.e. “surplus”) that can be used to predict and manipulate human behavior is, ultimately, a non-zero-sum outcome of a phenomenon that’s literally as old as civilization.Yes, data about our purchases can be used to infer our demographic information and predict future purchases, and yes, our likes and the syntax of our messages can be used for purposes far removed from sharing and communication, but arbitrarily describing this phenomenon as the deliberate generation and capture of behavioral surplus by sinister corporate actors is an easily disputed account. One could (and I would) just as simply claim that technologies like social media, e-commerce, powerful smartphones, and others were inevitably going to generate data that could be used for purposes beyond the domains of their origin, and that, over the long term, some of those purposes are going to end up being socially useful and desirable.This would be the manifestation of non-zero-sumness in action, not merely a misanthropic extraction of “surplus.”The mention of inevitability is, of course, a huge point of departure from Zuboff’s reasoning, and she categorically rejects notions of “technological inevitabilism,” or that technological development follows a quasi-deterministic, social context-independent trajectory. According to her, “technology is not and never can be a thing in itself, isolated from economics and society. This means that technological inevitability does not exist.”Herein lies the second thread.When it comes to matters of economy and society, I’ve found that left-leaning intellectuals tend to see a world in which order is imposed from the top-down, whereas those more rightward often see systems as emerging from the bottom-up. Because Surveillance Capitalism is ultimately about the societal impacts of technology, I think that bottom-up perspectives are important alternatives for anyone to consider before embracing the belief that malevolent powers are at work transforming the world into an episode of Black Mirror. Thinkers like W. Brian Arthur and Kevin Kelly (whom Zuboff cites, and, as it happens, also wrote a book entitled 
The Inevitable
), among others, have developed just this: sophisticated, bottom-up frameworks for analyzing technological change. In their school of thought, technological progress is fundamentally evolutionary in nature, and rather than being the all-powerful arbiters of technology’s trajectory, engineers and capitalists are merely the means of variation and selection that drive the process forward.Arthur describes this process as a kind of combinatorial evolution in which technologies emerge, mature, and then combine with other technologies to become components of yet more complex technologies (transistors become cheap and powerful and become components of integrated circuits, integrated circuits become cheap and powerful and become components of hardware systems, hardware systems become cheap and powerful and become components of software systems, and so on). Seen through this lens, surveillance capitalism can be viewed as having emerged from the evolutionary confluence of three domains: telecommunication, ubiquitous computing, and data science. As costs declined and performance increased in these fields—resulting in everyone carrying always-networked devices everywhere in a world that has techniques for analyzing the deluge of data generated by them—the emergence of something resembling surveillance capitalism was, in a sense, inevitable. Similarly, in 
What Technology Wants
, Kelly posits that technological progress is a fundamentally impersonal process that proceeds largely independent of the efforts or whims of individuals. At the frontier of a scientific discipline or an economic sector, insight is converged on, not willed into being. As time proceeds, more and more evidence mounts, and as the evidence progressively illuminates the unknown, many different parties are likely to independently fill in the same gaps and make the same leaps in reasoning.Among the examples Kelly invokes to illustrate this are Alfred Russell Wallace and Charles Darwin’s coincident development of the theory of natural selection, Alexander Graham Bell and Elisha Gray’s simultaneous patent applications for the telephone, and he also makes a compelling case that even if a unique genius like Einstein hadn’t developed relativity, others would have eventually.When it comes to the development of the next big thing in business, Zuboff is quick to highlight the importance of personalities like Alfred Sloan and Henry Ford in influencing history or the centrality of corporate actors like Apple and Google in dictating the future, but at the same time there’s a strong case to be made that if it wasn’t them operating at the frontier, it’d be somebody else, and they’d probably follow the same leads and make similar decisions.Which of these perspectives is closer to truth in the context of surveillance capitalism—that its technologies have been directed from c-suites or that they’ve followed a more decentralized evolution—should be pretty easy to determine by retrospectively examining the extent to which far afield parties in academia and industry were independently working on similar projects at the same time (my money’s on the latter). A more balanced view that I think can partially reconcile notions of inevitabilism with Zuboff’s stance is the contention that the development of technologies is inevitable, but the commercial viability of them is not. This, I believe, is how the story typically plays out when engineering, economics, and ethics collide.That said, Zuboff’s intuitions are correct when she highlights the incentives and imperatives facing surveillance capitalists, but she’s wrong to frame the economic landscape as one in which the future is dictated by concentrated power in the hands of an elite cadre of unassailable monopolists and their armies of engineers.This is, essentially, my third issue with the book: it paints an excessively cynical portrait of the figures it designates as surveillance capitalists, and it portrays their companies as unrealistically powerful.Several reviews of the book I’ve read note how little attention Zuboff pays to the notion of competition in the markets of the products she addresses, and that certainly stood out to me as well. The book gives the impression that economic production is a one-way street in which powerful producers push their corporate agendas onto an enfeebled public without resistance. In the world of Surveillance Capitalism, if a successful corporation hatches a plan for a new product or source of surveillance revenue, the world shall have it. Zuboff scarcely entertains the notion that consumers generally face markets with competing alternatives, or that consumer preference can influence market outcomes. It’s worth noting that not only can consumers get along just fine with DuckDuckGo instead of Google, but that privacy-related concerns are precisely what created the former’s market opportunity and enabled its success. Similarly, Apple’s reputation for maintaining user privacy has been a boon to its business and brand. Moreover, there’s practically nothing one can buy from Amazon that one can’t buy elsewhere, and abstention from Facebook hardly leaves individuals without the means of digital contact with others. These are powerful firms, no doubt, and they may even be too powerful, but that power is hardly unbounded.To the contrary, producers’ power is constrained by the social ecologies of government, the press, the public, and consumer feedback in which they exist. Governments have the power to impose regulations that can end any and all aspects of surveillance capitalism, the press regularly pillories corporate actors for their shenanigans, the public is quick to sour the reputations of misbehaving businesses, and consumers dictate—however imperfectly—what they are and are not willing to tolerate regarding their privacy. For a technology to become ubiquitous, “push” from producers is half of the story, but the other half is “pull” from consumers and society, and the latter is a dimension that Zuboff largely disregards (at one point, she states that, “Google Glass neatly illustrates the tenacity of the extraction imperative and its translation into commercial practice” shortly before noting (without irony) that, “Those who wore the device were recast as “glassholes,” and some businesses banned them from their premises.”)....[This review continues in the comments.]"

149,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/119421823-john,4,"Shoshana Zuboff ‘s The Age of Surveillance CapitalismThis book, a best seller is essentially in two parts. The first, introductory chapters provide an outline analysis of what Zuboff considers to be a radically, deleterious, new form of accumulation regime in capitalism – surveillance capitalism. The second part is much more discursive and concerned with broader historical trends in western society and culture that have led to the ‘Age’ designated in the book’s title. The first part (which includes in my reading elements of Zuboff’s second part) details Surveillance Capitalism’s (SC) particular mode of extraction of profit/surplus value. Zuboff call’s this (using actual industry terminology but flexing it to analytical purpose) ‘data exhaust’ arising from individuals’ (rarely, in Zuboff’s generally psychological understanding of SC, groups’) online social and overtly e-commercial activity. This exhaust is the digital-form of online behavioural activity, the data trail any user leaves in their wake. This enables SC’ concerns, such as Google, Amazon, Facebook and Microsoft to trap, trace, then predict and in turn prompt and manipulate that behaviour in the future. The second part of the book, the Age part, traces influence of the political-economic neo-liberalist Hayekian School economic currents of the period, along with the affinity SC managerial thinking has with Skinnerian behaviourism (due to the behavioural tracing and tracking in data exhaust.)So Zuboff insists that SC is a dangerous vertiginous development that provides a historical break from traditional market based capitalism which from the 19th century on up to SC was premised generally by an understanding of consumer demand arising from aggregations of individual preferences and (relatively) autonomous choice in overwhelmingly non-virtual market places. This period was without the massive levels of consumers’ behavioural data exhaust now available following expansive virtual online economic and social activity. Traditional capitalism, also, despite the predominance of mass media and relentlessly progandizing forms of persuasion, did not have the sophisticated feedback mechanisms available under SC.Zuboff, also, glossing Durkhiem’s idea of the Division of Labour in Society, sees these trends as a tragic mutation affecting the contemporary state of the ‘division of learning’. SC puts unprecedented (Zuboff’s favourite, pervasive, adjective in describing SC, yet her historical work on its roots suggests, rather, a quantitative change – perhaps unparalleled would be the better word – see below on this) control of learning into the hands of SC:Eventually, Google codified a tactical playbook on the strength of which its SC operations were successfully institutionalized as the dominant form of information capitalism, drawing new competitors [i.e. Facebook] eager to participate in the race for surveillance revenues. (19) Much of Zuboff’s academic research into SC is into the patenting applications of big tech companies, Google, Microsoft and Facebook and Amazon (but not, generally Apple which is seen by her as a less ‘rogue’ form of high tech SC, at least in terms of individuals’ data manipulation and extraction). Zuboff notes in particular Goggle’s 2003 patent Generating User Information for Use in Targeted Advertising which bluntly stated that the company had built up sufficient capability from data exhaust to provide it with the material to deploy a honed or individualized focussing of ads sent directly to particular users:[This] patent is emblematic of the new mutation and the emerging logic of accumulation that would define Google’s success. Of even greater interest, it also provides an unusual glimpse into the ‘economic orientation’ baked deep into the technology cake by reflecting the mindset of Google’s distinguished scientists as they harnessed their knowledge to the firms new aims. 77In this way, Zuboff’s tracing of the consciously manipulatively thinking of Big Tech companies serves to counter techno-determinist arguments, what Zuboff calls ‘inevitablism’ (‘SC was initiated by a specific group of human beings in a specific time and place’ 85.) The ends of all of this is mass population via individuated manipulation, and SC control and direction of the social division of learning.2Another of the, many, strengths of this study is its historical and conceptual defining of SC. Continually Zuboff makes the point that this form of capitalism is qualitative new, ‘unprecedented’. She presents the reader with a refined vocabulary in which to name, reveal and categorize SC – much of the terminology drawn from the actual language ‘out there’ feeding the mindset of the data tech minions in SC computer labs and managerial meeting rooms. ‘Data exhaust’, for example is seen to be common parlance in this (2014) statement of Microsoft’s CEO Satya Nadella:The opportunity we have in this new world is to find a way of catalyzing this data exhaust from ubiquitous computing and converting it into fuel of ambient intelligence. 162)Sometimes Zuboff re-embodies terms which seem innocent, pervasive and common, but have developed in SC in sinister ways, such as ‘search’ which, seemingly so innocent, was key to the propulsion of Google’s ‘supply chains’ of behavioural data (128):I tell them [young people] that the word ‘search’ has meant a daring existential journey, not a finger tap to already existing answers; that ‘friend’ is an embodied mystery that can be forged only face-to-face and heart-to-heart; and that ‘recognition is the glimmer of homecoming we experience in our beloved’s face, not ‘facial recognition’. 521Such points, perhaps romantic (can friends never be digitally initiated, conveyed and sustained by means of digital media?) are made to ‘replenish’ the politics of western democracy in the face of SC’s form of Newspeak, regain the meaning of words so that we might counter SC’s undermining of democratic politics.Zuboff is often a catastrophist in the second part of her book, but she is also utopianist in that she wants to remind us of alternative hopes, and possible directions of digital/information capitalism. In catastrophist terms she talks of the present organization of human nature and social experience in SC’s domination of the social division of learning as the ‘7th Extraction’ (in distinction to the disastrous ecological consequences of the 6th extraction of industrial mass production capitalism) (516). She always nudges us, reminds us, about the political and economic alternatives, such as ‘exchange-based advocacy-oriented market form[s]’:Mass production was aimed at new sources of demand in the early 20th century’s first mass consumers....supply and demand were linked effects of the new ‘conditions of existence’ that defined the lives of my great-grandparents Sophie and Max and other travelers in the first modernity. Ford’s invention deepened the reciprocities between capitalism and these populations. In contrast Google’s inventions destroyed the reciprocities of its original social contract with users. The role of the behavioral value reinvestment cycle that had once aligned Google with its users changed dramatically. 88The catastrophist element of this book’s second part is reminiscent of the popular 1970s’ sociological writing of Alvin Toffler or Vance Packard’s 1950s hit The Hidden Persuaders. Admittedly, such studies were much less theoretically and empirically astute in comparison with Zuboff’s book. However, Zuboff is herself is prone to an over-reliance on metaphor and hyperbole. In particular, this can be seen in her insistence on the ‘unprecedented’ nature of SC, a word she uses so heavily it becomes somewhat irritating in its iniquitousness. It as a consequence increasingly becomes emptied of impact and it is obvious that to say something is unprecedented doesn’t mean it is necessarily bad in the singular connotation Zuboff gives the word. Also, when Zuboff refers to previous ‘ages’ which had similar rogue forms of ‘robber baron’’ capitalism, such as marked the Gilded Age (105), her argument about the unprecedentedness of SC is undermined. As noted at the start, this book is a best seller (perhaps this is marked by the fact that it’s voice-book form is actually cheaper than its paperback edition – indicating its accessability) and there is nothing wrong with popularity and accessibility. But it is telling that Zuboff regularly falls into over- elaborated metaphorical language. At one point she talks about SC as ‘more Mad Max than Red Cross, more Black Sails than Carnival Cruise. The wizards behind their steering wheels...’ 193. She regularly uses mixed metaphorical language (‘the human hive’, ‘just like the self-driving cars and the policy-worshipping jackhammers’. 414). Popularity and accessibility is perhaps also the explanation for the, surprising for an academic, use of misleading metaphors such as evolutionary similes (‘These contests are the stage upon which SC made its debut and rose to stardom as the author of a new chapter in the long saga of capitalism’s evolution’ 17.)3Zuboff stresses that it is capitalism, in it’s 2nd Modernity manifestation, that is crucial and core to her analysis of surveillance society. Capitalism is in the driving seat of surveillance technology, it drives high tech digital information technology today simply in the pursuit of profit. She sometimes examines military drivers, the appearance and control of surveillance by state capitalist China, for example. But it is the profit driver which she stresses as key, particularly as a result of neo- liberalism’s rhetoric of free markets, freedom of the individual entrepreneur, the limiting of the state. This is the ‘Big Other’ that marks out SC, the data gathering instrumentalism of world dominating digital tech media concerns like Google from the ‘Big Brother’ of totalitarianism. She therefore sees the ‘gainers’ of these conditionsas being the managerial elites of Microsoft, Google, Facebook and, of course, their shareholders and banking backers.My main criticism here is that this over stresses capitalism, it is a reductive argument. One might think about the pioneering analyses of surveillance society, like Lyon’s, where the state is seen as a key driver, alongside markets and capitalistic extraction of surplus value. One might think, also, about the academic field, institutions like MIT, in moulding and supplying the types of highly-educated individuals, like Zukerberg and his ranks of staffers or ‘tuners’ (505) who inhabit the material spaces of these concerns and reap the rewards (which may not be just financial.) Then there is the whole complex of manufacturers of digital hardware, computers, networking software, cables infrastructure, wireless technologists, who also extract more traditional forms of surplus value from high tech capitalism.Zuboff needs a much more fully formulated analytical understanding of the forms of power which are distinct from market and (to a much lesser extent) state sources. There are many forms of power, many types of interests that are driving the SC profit-driven ‘fraction’ of surveillance society. Related to this is the fact that this book cries out for a better sociology of SC. It is not enough to examine the rise of ‘tuners’ and ‘priests’ (466) and tech executives alone in the formation of SC. Often Zuboff talks of powerful ‘networks’ (341) but is actually hazy about the who of thesenetworks. When Zuboff uses the word ‘capitalism’ she tends to use it in an adjectival sense as descriptive rather than its noun-form which might help us to define the much larger social groups and classes benefiting from SC. Thus, in a section entitled ‘How did they get away with it?’ it is not clear who ‘they’ are, it is rather that ‘surveillance capitalism represents an unprecedented [that word again] logic of accumulation defined by new economic imperatives...’ (337)Finally, I am not sure about Zuboff’s analysis of SC in terms of its application of searching out in it the tenets of Skinner’s behavioural psychology:Skinner imagined technologies that would pervasively institutionalize the viewpoint of the Other-One as they observed, computed, analyzed, and automatically reinforced behavior to accomplish the ‘vast changes’ that he believed were necessary. In this way the laws of human action would finally be illuminated so that behavior could be effectively predicted and shaped...(369)Zuboff’s underlying romantic view is of the individual's autonomy and volition, if given a free public sphere and open media, to make rational decisions in their social and market place activities. The Skinnerian behaviourism is her countering stalking horse to that position. But a social phenomenon like SC needs to be equally, at least, referred to in terms of surveillance society if we are to have any adequate understanding of who benefits as much as the why. We must delineate which social groups, classes, have the contemporary historical relationship to SC that bears equivalence to the groups of agrarian bourgeoisie, urban bourgeoisie, who benefited from industrial and 1st Modernity capitalism. Behaviourist theory is inherently reductive, universalistic in its conception of human motivation and the nature of the mind, and therefore limited in providing a theory of large scale historical socio- economic phenomenon like SC.Along with the use of highly metaphorical language, what also contributes to this book’s popularity is its quoting of statements given by tech SC’ CEOs and other executives: they are really jaw-dropping. But these direct professions of policy can only tell us so much – essentially that of the consciously manipulative behaviour and thought, of SC. The shock value of these quotes can deflect attention from the ‘unspoken’, structural social, political and economic forces driving SC. For this we need to turn to a range of thinkers of second modernity, like Giddens, Beck, Harvey, Piketty, Krugman and others who pursue and depict its landscape by differentiating sources of power and assessing their particular contribution to any particular mix like SC. At one point Zuboff talks about the power of ‘naming’, the performative power of words in changing the world and in effecting domination (177). But, as Bourdieu pointed out in Language and Symbolic Power, the performative needs to be understood in the context of the ‘perforce’ of the social conditions that make any word performative. It is not enough to simply show the words spoken, the conscious policy statements of Austrian school neo liberal thinkers, academic behavioural psychologists, and tech CEOs in relation to SC alone: we must have a much more complex conceptualisation of the mix of sources of power that effects the performativity of their words."

Surveillance capitalism: An expropriation of critical human rights that is best understood as a coup from above: an overthrow of the people's sovereignty.We are an 'information civilisation', where acquired data not used for product improvements is a 'behavioural surplus', fabricated into 'prediction products', traded in a behavioral futures market. Then, to optimise profit, those in possession of this 'instrumentarian power' move from just knowing our behaviour to shaping it, putting themselves in a position of uncontrolled power.In political terms, surveillance capitalism doesn't just feed on labor, but on every aspect of human behaviour.Zuboff points out we are not the products of these free services, but the raw material, used to construct a product. Ownership of the means of behavioural modification eclipses ownership of the means of production as the fountainhead of capitalist wealth and power. Operating outside of a framework of accountability, surveillance capitalism is anti-democratic.To combat surveillance capitalism, we have to realise that it does not equate the digital nor technology. It's only a particular implementation that is not inevitable, but a consequence of the overriding objectives of its masters.Zuboff identifies the start of the surveillance capitalist journey with Apple's introduction of the iPod and iTunes, catering to markets of one, as remedies for inequality and exclusion. But, this shift to individualism dove tailed with the neoliberal economic paradigm of destroying individual agency.Then, Zuboff identifies a 'first modernity', the rise of industrial mass production, a 'second modernity', the rise of markets of one and individualism and, now a 'third modernity', the rise of surveillance capitalism, where the wide acceptance of neoliberal policies allows capitalists to disconnect from their social context, fostering societal instability and social inequality. Google's move into surveillance capitalism started in the early 2000s, with the insight to not target search terms as such for monetisation, but to have the value of these search terms be defined by their usage, making the users of Google's search engine the raw material of the product Google was selling.Google became a seller of ads, optimising the prediction of behaviour, directly also putting value on the ability to change users' behaviour.Then, with the absence of meaningful laws in the virtual domain, with the state's need for monitoring and control after 9/11, where Zuboff uses the term 'surveillance exceptionalism', the likes of Google, Facebook and Amazon have become modern-day robber barons, bending laws to themselves and their own.It also explains why these players want to avoid being seen as 'publishers', which would require to police their own content, weeding out extremism, because these extremes are in themselves desirable data points which big tech can use to, in turn, exploit the masses.Politically, big tech firms obfuscate their intentions and behaviour by blurring its public and private interests, through a revolving door where individuals move from politics to business and back, while heavily influencing relevant academic work.Meanwhile, in the hunt for behavioural surplus, capturing information on how users behave, it makes perfect sense why Google and Facebook work on such a wide range of products, and why they are such strong supporters of the 'Internet of Things'. Each move into unchartered territory has the promise of reaping huge amount of behavioural data, which in turn allows big tech to predict future behaviour and sell that information.It is why Google shuts down so many of its ventures; they simply don't produce enough data to make them worthwhile.Zuboff describes a tool in Google and Facebook's arsenal, the 'dispossession cycle', first tried and tested with Google's Gmail; It goes from incursion to habituation to adaptation to redirection. First, Google moves into a field where no legal boundaries exist, like the comprehensive scanning of email, or the collection of street view. Then, even if there are complaints, operating at the slow pace of democracy, we become habituated to the incursion. Then, if a large enough push back exists, cosmetic adaptations are followed by a redirection of the focus of the complainants.Zuboff identifies Google's mantra: 1. Human experience is free for the taking;2. We have the right to convert this into behavioural data; 3. We have the right to own that data;4. We have the right to know what that data discloses; 5. We have the right to decide how to use that knowledge; 6. We have the right to preserve these rights.This leads to a 'division of learning', where the machine knows, business models decide and capital decides who decides.To explain with an example, Facebook shows you your newsfeed, 'optimised' for you, based on your past actions. But Facebook also keeps a vast trove of data on your behaviour that doesn't feed back to you, but is used to optimise predictions that are sold to third parties. This 'hidden data' Zuboff calls the 'shadow text'.The result is that the likes of Google and Facebook are separated from the people through an insurmountable barrier of knowledge.So, surveillance capitalism is inherently undemocratic. Only answering to the logic of accumulation, producing knowledge inaccessible to ourselves, while, as it is not the state, and relevant laws are absent, unaccountable for its own behaviour.So, now, it's corporations that know, it's the market form that decides, and it's the competitive struggle between surveillance companies which decides who decides.This one-sided control leads to the 'uncontract'. The data collector acts, and we behave, not knowing how our actions are influenced in real time, while a future of ubiquitous computing and a globe covering IoT is presented as inevitable.Zuboff sees the dispossession of human experience as the original sin of surveillance capitalism. She then calls ‘rendition’ the process of turning experience into data; we talk about who owns our data, but forget that this data does not need to exist in the first place.There can be no surveillance capitalism without rendition, but rendition is not automatically followed by surveillance capitalism. Data can not be collected and, if collected, does not need to result in profit margins for external parties.In short, it is not you who searches Google, it's Google which searches you.This manipulation of our real-time behaviour Zuboff calls ‘actuation’ and provides ‘economies of action’, achieving behaviour modification through tuning, herding and conditioning; “we are learning how to write the music, and then we let the music make them dance”. Because of that, our 'future tense is endangered'.How did we get there:1. Surveillance capitalism is unprecedented in scope.2. Invasion of the public and private by obfuscation.3. Societal preference for businesses to self regulate.4. Fortification through political lobbying.5. The dispossession cycle, normalizing abuse before regulation can curtail it.6. Our dependency on services provided.7. Self interest of benefitting players, like small businesses.8. Fear of missing out.9. Our identification with the successful leaders of the surveillance capitalists.10. Our viewing these leaders as authorities because of their success.11. Social persuasion.12. Lack of meaningful alternatives.13. Feeling of inevitabilsm.14. Exploitation of human frailty.15. Ignorance of the abused.16. The speed at which these processes operate.Not unlike totalitarianism, instrumentarianism operates through behavioural modification, not through violence or the threat of it. This hidden hand of instrumentarian power, Zuboff calls 'Big Other'. Big Other is radically indifferent, it does not care if news is fake, as long as it generates behavioural surplus, generates data-points that identifies how we behave, which then can be monetised. And. for Big Other, outlier behaviour serves no purpose. Individualism is unpredictability, which can not be sold; Only predicted outcomes are desired.Surveillance capitalists aim for unfettered freedom as well as perfect knowledge. In a situation like this, there is no uncertainty, there is no invisible hand of the market.Then there is the shift from a reciprocity between customers as employees and business, to users as sources of raw material sold.That, in addition to the very small workforce employed by surveillance capitalists also means a political reciprocity between labor and capital is no longer required for big tech to flourish.Then, surveillance capitalism’s radical indifference is geared towards growth by any means.All this makes surveillance capitalism profoundly undemocratic. It is tyranny with the objective of dominating human nature.Zuboff doesn't mention it, but it appears that one way of tricking this machine, is to feed it bad data. The machine monitors what you do, so you have to make it appear you do what you do not. So, say, run a bot on your machine that behaves like a person, starting programs, searching for information, except that all actions are nonsensical.Zuboff finishes: be the friction. She could have used less words, though.Zuboff occasionally throws in some real-world surveillance examples; Roomba which sold maps of individual users' houses, collected by the vacuum cleaners; Vizio, a manufacturer of smart TVs generating 100 billion(!) data points per day, selling this data to third parties which were then able to trace this back to individual users."

161,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2326664-alexis,4,"There's a cliché that says if a company offers you something for free, you're the product. That's not quite true when it comes to the data driven technology firms reviewed in this book. What we are is the raw material, and the product is behavioral surplus--the corpus of data that the firms derive from our behaviors. Shoshana Zuboff distinguishes surveillance capitalism from traditional capitalism through the use of behavioral surplus. In a traditional arrangement, money is exchanged for a product or service. While the company is interested in the behavior of its customers, that information is used to improve marketing and sell more product, and is not a product in itself. In surveillance capitalism, we trade our behavior for services, and the firm derives its profit from selling that behavioral surplus. In this arrangement, Apple is still largely traditional. Amazon is also still traditional, though it's expanding into surveillance capitalism through products such as Alexa. Google and Facebook are almost pure surveillance capitalism firms. Surveillance capitalism operates through information asymmetry. Consumers may not be told about the information gathered, are given opaque terms of use (the average TOU should take 45 minutes to read; the average consumer takes 19 seconds--and if you don't really have a practical choice about using the product, what are you going to do?) and aren't aware of how much information can actually be extracted. For example, it's obvious that your shopping patterns can be used to form a picture of your tastes and spending habits. It's less obvious that your selfies and other pictures can be used to form a portrait of your personality. The point, moreover, is not merely to analyze your behavior patterns, or even to use that data to make predictions. The ultimate goal is to use this data to shape future behavior, as Facebook did with its voting experiment--and then argued that it should be exempt from the laws and regulations surrounding psychological research. Pokémon Go functioned as both a collector and shaper of players' behavior, and the game was originally developed at Google.The potentials for surveillance capitalism are worrying--applications already exist and are being developed for behavioral surplus. How will firms in other areas benefit from this, using surveillance techniques to determine creditworthiness, insurance, and health? Although in surveys people express a desire for strong privacy roles, we lack a robust regulatory framework to ensure this. The outcry over election manipulation also makes clear the potential (and reality) for large scale political disruption, which is particularly worrying given the dismissive attitudes of many tech titans towards democracy. Silicon Valley companies actively lobby against a regulatory framework that would protect consumers, instead arguing in favor of ""the market"" and claiming that behavioral surveillance is ultimately for the benefit of the consumer. As a book, this is imperfect. Zuboff's language tends towards the hyperbolic, making it too easy to dismiss her as a conspiracy theorist. It's also a little long winded, rather than crisp and clear. None of this is enough to tank the book, but it keeps it from being quite as successful as it could be (were half stars allowed, I would have given this 4.5). That said, the content is worth ploughing through. "
162,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23606811-emilio-garcia,4,"""The age of surveillance capitalism"" is one of the books of the season among those interesting on the process of the digital transformation of the society and economy. Furthermore, I´m pretty sure it will transcend this season and becomes one of those few books that will inform digital policy-making for a long time. However, it´s not perfect as a book, in order to illustrate her theories, the author provides an excessive number of examples with more details that are needed.I was fortunate to attend a key note given by Shoshana Zuboff three years ago, when I supposed she was writing this book. She was extremely passionate describing the concept of surveillance capitalism int the same terms as she described in the book. In the same manner as she does in the book, she started describing its origins in the day when a then small company called Google discovered that the data collected providing services could be used not only for improving services, but also to extract (without asking for permission) a behavioral surplus that allows to predict the future behavior of users, that could be the base for building up services for third parties.But the exploitation of an innovative business (and surveillance capitalism deserves this qualification) needs for its consolidation a strategy. The author also shows how the mix of aggressive lobbying, revolving doors and penetration into the academy have provided Google (and others after) a competitive advantage based on its image of innovative and benefical-for-all company. This competitive advantage has been the base for an incremental development of a set of products beyond its origin as a search page, all them base on a production cycle of incursion (providing a product that aims to obtain some personal information of the users by surprise), habituation (making the service a need for users), adaptation (introducing minor changes to answer the critics on violating privacy) and redirection (looking for new manners to extract more personal information). The author rightly compares this dispossession cycle of personal information with the conquer strategies of colonial powers, that claimed more and more territories for their Empires without nay other base than brute force.As you read the book, you will go deeper in Alice's rabbit hole. The bigger issue with surveillance capitalism companies is not the massive accumulation of data that serves for creating new services for third party which are basically the selling of privacy spheres of people (e.g. the Cambridge Analytics case). The most worrisome consequence its the capacity that these companies acquire to automate the behaviour of people in what the author called ""instrumentarianism."", which we sometimes wrongly confuse with totalitarianism. That instrumentarianism. is a new political model basically on the hands of private companies more powerful than governments, only makes things worst.As I have started, this is a must read book. Perhaps its teorethical part woulld have been explained in less pages, but perhaps that would have mean making the book less asequible to people which are not familiar with digital services. The only possible comparison with other book that I can establish is with Piketty's ""Capital in the 21st century"", and it will be equally influential for some years."

165,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59189347-ken-muldrew,4,"Shoshana Zuboff’s book, “The Age of Surveillance Capitalism” represents the first solid counter strike against the tech giants of Silicon Valley who are not only being evil (Google’s motto is “Don’t be evil”), but are being evil with a stealthy effectiveness that is breathtaking. They aren’t hacking the arms off children or spreading biological weapons from airplanes, but beneath the surface of their carefully branded image of beneficent innovators, they are making a determined play to dominate all of humanity. Their strategy is based on the subversion of neoliberal capitalism, the prevailing belief that economic prosperity is best achieved through minimally regulated trans-national market capitalism. The “free” market of capitalism worked because the vast amounts of information that were aggregated by the market and summarized through the price mechanism of supply and demand were unknowable in detail by any human or group of humans. Every individual could provide information about their own personal self-interest to the market without any loss of freedom. Surveillance capitalists are now able to capture that information on an individual basis and use it to predict how every individual will behave and even to control that behaviour. This is actually an attack on market capitalism by stealth, using its strengths to return the populace into a feudal relationship with those who have amassed great wealth.Private property, a foundational component of a capitalist economy, actually started out as the property that individuals were able to hide from the state. Through long use and custom, the state eventually came to be the protector of private property, making capitalism possible. Individual privacy, however, has always been hidden from the state; there being no mechanism for the state’s organs to pry information from individuals beyond what they were willing to give (at least not without destroying the individual, thereby making the information somewhat less useful). In the wake of the 9/11 attacks, however, when the American government used that event to initiate a full-court press to simply take information from citizens with no respect for law, custom, or popular opinion, corporations found that they, too, could simply take this information using communication technology to intercept what had always been private. These audacious power grabs have revealed that individual privacy cannot be commoditized; that even though it is specific to individuals, it is a public good. There is simply no way to make it an exchangeable good without destroying its value to society. Surveillance capitalists are simply taking individual privacy while pretending that individuals are selling their private property (their own privacy) through click-wrap agreements in exchange for the technology that they crave. It is a dangerous lie and Shoshana Zuboff has begun the process of exposing their treachery.Zuboff gives a thoroughly researched overview of how the tech giants went about taking and exploiting the “behavioural surplus” once it was discovered by Page and Brin at Google. This is the strongest part of the book, though not without some annoyances. Zuboff has a strong belief that the first step in countering this attack on our freedom and self-interest as individuals is to name the various phenomena so that they can be recognized and discussed. Being the first to write comprehensively on this topic, she coins a lot of new terms for the many arts of the surveillance capitalist; some of these names linger like a bad smell. For example, she coins “division of learning” to represent the separation of society into classes that surveil and use surveillance data for their own purposes, and those that are surveilled. She takes this from “division of labour”, a term that economists use (starting with Adam Smith) to denote the benefits of cooperative labour when people split a complex task into many subtasks, but sociologists seem to use the term to mean the specialization of labour into management and worker. The two meanings are not at all the same, and the confusion does not help Zuboff in her goal of clarifying through naming. The “learning” part is completely inexplicable unless it’s a play on “machine learning”. She is obviously talking about “knowledge” rather than “learning” and one can’t help but feel that she is trying to invoke some kind of resonance with learning as virtue, and the appropriation of who can be allowed to learn as the opposite of virtue. Later on she also coins the term “big other” as a play on Orwell’s “big brother”, such cheap puns are, of course, an abomination. One other area where I think she went badly off the rails is in her contention that Google brought surveillance capitalism into being by simply declaring it. Here she invokes Searle’s notion of a declaration as a creator of social reality. But in Searle’s formulation, the person who makes the declaration must have a status function that causes people to accept the declaration. If Larry Page declared himself to be Prime Minister of India, it would have no effect. And besides, Google kept what they were up to secret for as long as they possibly could. It is Zuboff who is making the declaration that invents surveillance capitalism by shining a light on the thieves at Google. Although the description of what surveillance capitalism is, and who the surveillance capitalists are, is excellent, Zuboff is rather fuzzy about who is purchasing the behavioural surplus that these companies are selling. There are vague intimations of giant, corporate dens of pure evil but no names and no specific actions that are being taken by the organizations that are buying this data. The political machinations of companies like Cambridge Analytica are now well known, but they just used Facebook to get data on people. Who is paying Facebook to gather data on their behalf? What are they doing with that data? Are specific companies paying Facebook to modify behavior? These questions, and many more like them, are all hanging in the air now, and Facebook is refusing to answer to anyone. This is not really a criticism of Zuboff, other than she presents the behavioural futures market as something real with actual customers (without naming them). She might have tempered the certainty with which she talks about this market given that she has no specifics to share.The last part of the book looks at some potential dystopias that have been, and are being, pushed by behavioural fanatics. These are grim, to be sure, but they are no more than woolly-headed dreams. Behaviourism has had its day and whatever dystopia lies in our future, I doubt very much that these considerations will prove relevant. I have skipped over almost all of the good parts of this book to vent my spleen on these paltry complaints. There is just too much detailed information that will be completely unfamiliar to many, many people, whether they are technologically savvy or not, to summarize in a mini review. Zuboff’s book is required reading for anyone who wants to think of themselves as a citizen, as someone who is at least minimally informed about the most important issues affecting themselves, and the society to which they belong, in today’s world. Although I found some stylistic elements to be thoroughly annoying, this book is worth studying in detail and hopefully more people will be able to fill in the gaps of this new and highly dangerous attempt to grab social power and consolidate it in the hands of a privileged few."
166,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28146665-laura-hanu,3,"In this 2018 book, Shoshana Zuboff argues there is an increasingly bigger knowledge gap between what we know about the latest technology and how this technology is being used to know us. She names this new phenomenon surveillance capitalism, where our personal data has become the new commodity to be sold to third parties without our awareness.What I liked:By bringing together events and trends of big tech companies from the last 2 decades, Zuboff manages to build an in-depth picture of an occurring paradigm shift in our economy. This new form of capitalism revolves around extracting meaning out of increasingly large amounts of personal data in order to predict and influence our future behaviour.I liked how heavily researched this book is and how it introduces a new vocabulary to characterise this new economic imperative based on behavioural data.The book succeeds in building a thorough representation of the lawlessness (to be read more like a lack of actual relevant laws) that drives big tech decisions, often drawing parallels to colonialism, although this time, instead of land, it is our behaviour and personal information that has been commodified.What I wish was better::This book often uses hyperbolic language, which reveals the author’s bias and own judgement of big tech companies, unilaterally calling these the ‘Big Other’ and often comparing them to totalitarian institutions in their unruly ways of dealing with enormous amounts of data.Sometimes an argument is strengthened by bold language that aims to be thought-provoking, and sometimes it is weakened by overpowering epithets that make you question the author’s objectiveness.We are living in an unprecedented time when it is difficult for our regulatory bodies, legal systems, and government to catch up with rapidly evolving technology. This likely needs to change, but framing every tech firm with large enough amounts of data as a tyrannical, totalitarian form of capitalism might be going a few steps too far.The book felt slightly too long at times and occasionally opaque in language. I do believe this kind of thoroughness and formal language often helps build a more rounded and complex picture that is necessary, however, in this case, I wonder how accessible this book actually ends up being just due to its length."
167,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/228441-andrewh,4,"Before the recent visitation, Zuboff’s celebrated book would have had a great deal more power and relevance than it seems to have right now, in the midst of an unprecedented pandemic-driven downturn in global capitalism. It does, nonetheless, offer a compelling critique of a new mode of production, which she terms ‘surveillance capitalism’, and its broader threat to our autonomy and human rights. By academic standards, it is generally well written, with many telling phrases, but occasionally marred by long digressions and incongruously folksy anecdotes about her life. The solution to the problem posed is, unfortunately, not very clear.The broad argument is made in clear and persuasive fashion in the first 200 pages or so. Surveillance capitalism, she argues, is a new form of resource extraction mainly practiced by three big tech giants (Google, FaceBook and Microsoft), and is the result of the interaction of the two ‘vectors’ of societal movement from mass to individual (modernisation), and the neoliberal program of atomisation, which created a ‘second modernity’, in which individual is the locus of moral agency/choice – they have both a right and a requirement to make choices, with all the risks involved. This, she argues, created the conditions for the growth of the tech companies and surveillance capitalism itself. The starting-point for this new form of capitalism is, of course, Google, founded in 1998 and funded by venture capital. The issue for Google was to turn its search engine facility into a profitable business model (charging users not being an option). After the 2000 dotcom crash, when venture capitalists went cold, Google discovered ‘behavioural surplus’, i.e. using behavioural data gathered from searches for targeted advertising rather than simply improving search results. This took root in 2002, she says, with the commercialisation of its massive ‘data exhaust’ byproducts, using its predictive power to charge higher fees to advertisers, using click-through rates. Their data changed advertising from a ‘guessing game’ into a science of behaviour based on UPI (user profile information), culled from searches. Thus, they loosed a new form of capitalism on the world, she states, equal in importance to Fordism. In 2007 Facebook launched and hired Sheryl Sandberg from Google to turn them from a social networking site to an advertising giant as well (with access to unprecedented real user information, which was not just inferred from searches). This capitalism is a ‘behavioural futures market’, she says, and the surplus is not just limited to advertisers but can be used by any organisation interested in influencing behaviour, in principle – as could be seen in the 2016 US election and UK Brexit referendum.The unfettered environment in which these companies operated (with regard to privacy arguments, which always was claimed as necessary by Google), was bolstered by US fundamentalist arguments about ‘freedom’ and neoliberal arguments against regulation of business. After 9/11, these exceptionalist claims were further enhanced by the need of government agencies to monitor the population for signs of terrorism activity – there followed unprecedented cooperation between the NSA and Google for example, and the development of what the author calls ‘surveillance exceptionalism’. The notion of privacy as a right of citizens or consumers was brushed aside in this environment and served to entrench the power of surveillance capitalism to do as it wished. This was also enhanced by Google’s revolving doors with the US administration. These firms’ unprecedented accumulation of knowledge and power have given it dominance over the ‘division of learning’ in informational society, she claims, which is the basis for our social and moral order. She repeats three questions throughout the book in this regard: Who Knows [distribution]? Who decides [authority]? Who decides who decides [power]? . The problem is that of ‘the two texts’ – the public one, which we can read online, and the ‘shadow text’ used for surplus extraction, which is always hidden (we have no choice about this, having blindly acceded to the unreadable TOS) and they can use this info to shape the world. AI/machine intelligence requires huge amounts of computing power and huge amounts of data, both of which are in the hands of the big tech companies – his all creates an enormous asymmetry of knowledge-power. This is all fascinating and credible, and would have made for a very readable 350-page book but the author expands the argument with a plethora of case studies and extended discussions about various theories, some of which seem marginally relevant to the thesis and bulk the work out to 700 pages. Her theory of ‘instrumentarianism’ (the exploitation of our behavioural surplus and eventual goal of predicting and then controlling our behaviour for profit) is another form of Skinner’s radical behaviourism but for commercial outcomes. She says to call it ‘Digital Totalitarianism’ is wrongheaded: totalitarianism wanted to ‘engineer our souls’, to reshape humanity, but this new form of power has no interest in changing our souls – it just wants access to everything (it has ‘radical indifference’ to us as people or what we do – good or bad). The struggle for power and control in society is no longer associated with the ‘hidden facts’ of class and its relationship to production but rather by the facts of automated engineered behavioural modification, she states, and the role of what she calls ‘Big Other’. This process is exemplified by Facebook above all, which is the laboratory, as she sees it, of the future instrumentarian society, based on the (predictable) ‘hive collective’.So, what is to be done, as someone once said? Her suggestions here include the notion of ‘sanctuary’, which includes that of the rights of privacy. In the US, self-regulation is the norm, but in the EU, GDPR came into effect in 2018 – this seems unlikely to challenge Big Other to any great degree, given the huge battalion of corporate lawyers/lobbyists these firms possess. In any event, FB altered its TOS and thereby switched all its 1.5bn users to US law thereafter. At a more individual level, there are groups looking into ways to ‘hide’ from Big Other’s surveillance (a life ‘without walls’), but this movement, which is mainly artist-activists, has not triggered any mass withdrawal of consent from tech, partly from dependency and partly from lack of understanding of what is happening, she says. In conclusion, she says that Big Other must be regarded as a profoundly antidemocratic force and a ‘market driven coup from above’ – it annexes human experience to the market as the fourth commodity (after land, labour and money, which were all subject the constrain of law). In conclusion, she quotes from Orwell and Arendt and notes that we must act as ‘friction’ to the seamless processes of Big Other, and ‘claim the digital future as a human place’. After 500 pages of closely researched and argued text, this is a rather tame and woolly ending and left me so disappointed, I was forced to go back to religiously checking Twitter for updates on social isolation techniques.

I've been interested in online privacy for years, so I was aware of much of what I read. Others may be surprised or even shocked at what they learn. Unfortunately, the book's proposed solutions involve changing laws or society; there's nothing about what you can do (through behavior or technology) to protect your privacy online.Part 1 describes the origins and early years of surveillance capitalism, especially at Google. Part 2 explores how surveillance capitalism spread to the real world. Part 3 dives into ""Big Other,"" which is the antidemocratic use of surveillance capitalism to drive societal change.The book mentions many big tech companies, but focuses on Google and Facebook. The book frequently references Orwell's 1984 and Skinner's Walden Two.Zuboff's intent is to motivate action by raising awareness.

This book is intended as a contribution to that collective effort.I read this to learn more about online privacy, for my website Defending Digital.NotesHome or Exile in the Digital FutureSurveillance capitalism unilaterally claims human experience as free raw material for translation into behavioural data … declared as a proprietary behavioural surplus, fed into advanced manufacturing processes known as 'machine intelligence,' and fabricated into prediction products that anticipate what you will do now, soon, and later.

Insuring the liberty that nourishes democracy requires a structuring of societal use of information and even permitting some concealment of information. —Paul M. Schwartz, 1989… raw surveillance capitalism is as much a threat to society as it is to capitalism itself. This is not a technical undertaking, not a program for advanced encryption, improved data anonymity, or data ownership. Such strategies only acknowledge the inevitability of commercial surveillance. They leave us hiding in our own lives as we cede control to those who feast on our behavior for their own purposes. Surveillance capitalism depends on the social, and it is only in and through collective social action that the larger promise of an information capitalism aligned with a flourishing third modernity can be reclaimed.Rendition: From Experience to DataSince early 2017, Android phones had been collecting location information by triangulating the nearest cell towers, even when location services were disabled, no apps were running, and no carrier SIM card was installed in the phone. … enabling the company to track 'whether an individual with an Android phone or running Google apps has set foot in a specific store, and use that to target the advertising a user subsequently sees.'Data can be easily de-anonymized with just 3 pieces of public record data: birth date, ZIP code, gender.Rendition from the DepthsIn this way the 'personal digital assistant' is revealed as a market avatar, another Trojan horse in which the determination to render and monetize your life is secreted under the veil of 'assistance' and embellished with the poetry of 'personalization.'Though audio recordings from digital assistants may be anonymized, the recordings can include easily identifiable personal information.Samsung and Vizio have sold detailed smart TV viewing habits to third parties, which could track users across devices. Samsung shared audio recordings with third parties.The Right to the Future TenseSurveillance capitalism's new story begins with behavioral surplus discovered more or less ready-made in the online environment, when it was realized that the 'data exhaust' clogging Google's servers could be combined with its powerful analytics capabilities to produce predictions of user behavior.Surveillance capitalists' interests have shifted from using automated machine processes to know about your behavior to using machine processes to shape your behavior according to their interests.Big Other and the Rise of Instrumentarian PowerSurveillance capitalism is the puppet master that imposes its will through the medium of the ubiquitous digital apparatus. I now name the apparatus Big Other: it is the sensate, computational, connected puppet that renders, monitors, computes, and modifies human behavior.Forget the cliché that if it's free, 'You are the product.' You are not the product; you are the abandoned carcass. The 'product' derives from the surplus that is ripped from your life.China's ""social credit"" system tracks ""good"" and ""bad"" behavior across a variety of financial and social activities, based on public and private data, automatically assigning rewards and punishments to shape behavior.China can suspend Internet or social media accounts if users send messages containing certain terms.The Right to SanctuaryIf billions of sensors filled with personal data fall outside of Fourth Amendment protections, a large-scale surveillance network will exist without constitutional limits.A Coup from AboveYou give us more information about you, about your friends, and we can improve the quality of our searches.

It's a major campaign issue this year (at least on the non-fascist side.) What surprised me here (though perhaps it shouldn't have) is that big data is most of the very PURPOSE of Amazon, Facebook, Google, Apple, etc. It makes a lot of sense and it's a huge problem that Zuboff goes into with tremendous detail. Where this book falls apart, and where I have a problem with it, is that she suggests that there are somehow market solutions to this problem. It's the same mentality that leads to the concept of microlending: more capitalism to cure the evils of capitalism. Zuboff suggests that nothing was inevitable about the concept of surveillance capitalism. I disagree with this conclusion wholeheartedly. If there is money to be made under capitalism, corporations and ""entrepreneurs"" will do whatever they can to make it and they do not care what anyone (including the government) has to say about it. This is the fundamental evil and flaw of capitalism, and to suggest that there was any chance of avoiding it under the current system is breathtakingly naive. The ONLY way to avoid the dark future that Zuboff paints for us in this book is to abandon capitalism entirely, and to strip those who committed these privacy violations of all power whatsoever. I was not in any way surprised to find out at the end of the book that Zuboff was a student of the capitalist fraud Milton Friedman.This is a well-written, well-researched book about an extremely important issue.

The author was interviewed by Sam Biddle of The Intercept back in February 2019, as a pseudo-vernissage if you like:  https://theintercept.com/2019/02/02/s...“Surveillance capitalism arrived on the scene with democracy already on the ropes, its early life sheltered and nourished by neoliberalism’s claims to freedom that set it at a distance from the lives of people. Surveillance capitalists quickly learned to exploit the gathering momentum aimed at hollowing out democracy’s meaning and muscle. Despite the democratic promise of its rhetoric and capabilities, it contributed to a new Gilded Age of extreme wealth inequality, as well as to once-unimaginable new forms of economic exclusivity and new sources of social inequality that separate the tuners from the tuned. Among the many insults to democracy and democratic institutions imposed by this coup des gens, I count the unauthorized expropriation of human experience; the hijack of the division of learning in society; the structural independence from people; the stealthy imposition of the hive collective; the rise of instrumentarian power and the radical indifference that sustains its extractive logic; the construction, ownership, and operation of the means of behavior modification that is Big Other; the abrogation of the elemental right to sanctuary; the degradation of the self-determining individual as the fulcrum of democratic life; and the insistence on psychic numbing as the answer to its illegitimate quid pro quo. We can now see that surveillance capitalism takes an even more expansive turn toward domination that its neoliberal source code would predict, claiming its right to freedom and knowledge, while setting its sights on a collectivist vision that claims the totality of society” (p. 712, Libby e-book version). Quite the mind-mouthful to digest, but it’s a summary of sorts. This is a work of utmost scholarship written by a social psychologist and Harvard professor who has deftly connected the dots using history, psychology, and social psychology to illustrate how we got to this point in human history, as well as a portent to the near-future if Big Other isn’t neutered. It could be unsurprising that Biddle mentions its comparison to Marx’s Das Kapital from 1867 as his introduction to the interview above—it has that kind of power infused within it. Despite Dr. Zuboff’s refusal to accept inevitability (which she deserves praise for), my cynicism-slipping-into-nihilism believes that we’re screwed, and we’re screwed because governments have been basically impotent and powerless to hold our digital oligarchs and their vampiric corporations accountable. (Kudos to the few European nations that have tried to stand up for the commoners though, especially the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation [GDPR].) Without protections, it will be the end of Privacy, of Sanctuary, if it isn’t already obliterated—and we’re basically all complicit in this domination, as tech insidiously creeps into our lives and spaces with greater frequency and more predatory weapons invisible to all but IT gurus. “The body is simply a set of coordinates in time and space where sensation and action are translated into data. All things animate and inanimate share the same existential status in this blended confection, each reborn as an objective and measurable, indexable, browsable, searchable, ‘it’” (p. 296), and where “[e]ach node of the network—the vacuum cleaner, the mattress, the thermostat—must play its part, beginning with the frictionless rendition of behavior, as the whole team of seething insistent ‘smart’ things joins the migration to surveillance revenues. As we are shorn of alternatives, we are forced to purchase products that we can never own while our payments fund our own surveillance and coercion” (p. 333). We have the Snowden leaks, Cambridge Analytica, and China’s new “social credit” system to illustrate that Capitalism isn’t the only Vampire using our information against us. This is predatory in the truest sense, all guised by alluring tech and addictive apps, fed by insatiable needs for instant gratification, as well as wanton ignorance, and general powerlessness. We are the sheep. It is up to us, the voters, to elect those who will fight on our behalf, representatives morally upstanding and professionally competent, immune to bribes of every type, who wish to see a different model of society emerge. This fight against our Age of Surveillance Capitalism can go hand-in-hand with the issues and effects of the Anthropocene (industrial capitalism). Regulation, oversight, accountability, and transparency are all immediately necessary, and we should demand it vociferously. “If democracy is to be replenished in the coming decades, it is up to us to rekindle the sense of outrage and loss over what is being taken from us. In this I do not mean only our ‘personal information.’ What is at stake here is the human expectation of sovereignty over one’s own life and authorship of one’s own experience. What is at stake is the dominant principle of social ordering in an information civilization and our rights as individuals and societies to answer the questions Who knows? Who decides? Who decides who decides? That surveillance capitalism has usurped so many of our rights in these domains is a scandalous abuse of digital capabilities and their once grand promise to democratize knowledge and meet our thwarted needs for effective life. Let there be a digital future, but let it be a human future first” (p. 716). As an aside, I’d like to mention one of my favorite artists of all time, whose fantastic and fierce work in the 1980s was intensely thought about while reading this book: Barbara Kruger (http://www.arthistoryarchive.com/arth...). It’s fanciful to imagine a conversation between these two amazing people. Let the artists and scholars take the lead for profound change, the betterment of the species, and our stewardship of this precious planet, before it is too late."

The book is extremely convincing and feels big, powerful, and necessary. It's one of those books where you feel like everybody should read it. The point of the book is that a totally novel political problem such as this must be identified and described as a precondition for substantive action to be taken to correct it."

185,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9597988-chris,3,"Interesting book. On one level, Zuboff's book is rich in detail in particular about the ways in which Google, Facebook, Twitter, and a few other companies represent not only data mining but behavioral control that surveillance capitalism employs. She makes it clear that surveillance capitalism is not about the technology or even a few corrupt corporations, but instead it is about a new logic that has come to define a newer vampiric form of capitalism that harnesses our biometrics for profit whereby our status of consumer is far diminished in comparison. The book has a lot to offer in terms of people who have not followed these developments written in a highly accessible language. There are, however, some major short-comings of the book. Zuboff launches into an unneeded discussion of B.F. Skinner's behaviorism and totalitarianism that seems over-hyped to understand the logic of surveillance capitalism. By focus on these somewhat unneeded aspects she ignores a treasure trove of relevant studies regarding data mining, big data, surveillance, etc. as well as important theoretical insights provided by Autonomous Marxism, sociology by Chiapello and Boltanski, etc. Zuboff follows this narcissistic trend boldly proclaiming that she is charting out unexplored territory whereas she is really synthesizing, very well at times, earlier work and ignoring others who have delved in such areas before. She bombastically writes on page 17, ""This book is intended as an initial mapping of a terra incognita, a first foray that I hope will pave the way for more explorers."" This is complete bullshit, and perhaps if she paid more heed to earlier explorers, her work could have been more theoretically sophisticated. I kept finding value in the book for its large amount of details it provided regarding the workings of surveillance capitalism in concrete examples. But when she would start to wander off in more theoretical terrain, the book loses critical insight. Zuboff attempts to create a whole new terms like the Big Other (not Lacanian), instrumentarianism, and the like. But a lot of these ideas have been better deployed elsewhere that she could have developed upon. Also, her notion that surveillance capitalism reveals a significant break from earlier forms of ""kinder and gentler"" industrial capitalism is massively misguided. Of course, there are some significant differences, but it is hard to stomach when she keeps returning to Henry Ford as some kind of ideal where his ""innovations"" of the production line somehow revealed an advance that could balance capitalism's endless need for profit with concern for customers is laughable. Delving deeper into Ford would have been more productive since he wasn't just about innovating production, but also disciplining workers' lives through creating a sociological department at the factory where investigators would appear announced at workers' houses to make sure that they were living lives that Ford himself deemed acceptable and were not planning subversive resistance. So when Zuboff speaks about surveillance capitalism intruding upon all of our lives as if an unprecedented experience, good old industrial capitalism had already made some significant inroads in this during the pre-digital days. But what can you expect from a retired business professor who used to work at Harvard? Her politics and sense of history is shoddy. The book also offers relatively no sense of resistance except some simplistic genuflections of how some artists are challenging surveillance in their work. There is no sense of social movements at all with a few winks towards how earlier labor movements curbed industrial capitalism's exploitation of child labor and long working hours. Equally problematic, which is not limited to Zuboff's book but inherent in much scholarship on digital surveillance, is the way she often suggests how we are all equally effected by surveillance capitalism. Now, we are all definitely within the dragnet of surveillance capitalism, but it nonetheless is disproportionately impacting specific communities more than others such as low-income communities of color, protest communities, Muslim-American communities, Indigenous communities, transcommunities of color, etc. Because she mainly focuses on digital surveillance, she misses valuable ways in which surveillance capitalism impacts the offline world equally as well. She does make a couple of gestures towards this, but how about rather than spending an entire chapter on BF Skinner, the book look at the policing of Black Lives Matter, for example, and how the FBI harnessed data off of social media to track protesters, infiltrate their meetings and protests, and even fashion a new bogus term of ""black identity extremist."" Don't get me wrong: the book has a lot to offer even though its theoretical analysis is simplistic. But in a book of over 600 pages there are some glaring absences with undue amount of time spent on tangential concepts that do not really illuminate the inner workings of surveillance capitalism. Nonetheless, the synthesis of the workings of the logic of surveillance capitalism is nonetheless invaluable. "

190,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2206973-rick-harrington,5,"Yes this is a very important book. A lot of people have said so. But it’s a long book, and full of repetition, really just to be sure that the reader truly understands the dangers revealed here. It’s not easy to summarize, and not so easy to explain why it’s so important.I’ve tried to tell young people what’s wrong with Facebook and Google, and many of those “digital natives” don’t believe any of it, and don’t care. They care to learn the tricks for better results that I can’t grok, and they depend on Google for everyday existence, and on Facebook and it’s myriad spawn to keep in touch with their friends and more distant acquaintances.Branding themselves is second instinct, as is knowing who the creepers are and which security settings are really important. They don’t care about the monopolies, or that only one BIG COMPANY can pull it off because everyone and everything has to be where everyone else is. They don't care about the unknowns that aren't there.They don’t care about how products and thoughts and now behaviors are pushed their way, so long as they are happy with the results. Warnings about what may happen when some strong-man government gets hold of the social graphs just feel too distant, or so it seems.Zuboff descries a new exploitable freezone; a wilderness composed of human behavioral ""digital exhaust;"" a wilderness of human nature. As with any wilderness, it is a lawless place and so whatever is found can be grabbed by the first and then re-grabbed by the most powerful exploratory forces. Where once we set out to conquer the wilderness, Biblically urged perhaps, there is no place left unmapped now. This new territory couldn’t have existed without the same digital technology which mapped the old one. We cede the territory by the ""non-contract"" of a click.The ubiquitous full-on connectivity of cellphones and now the “internet of things” ensure the permanent reality of this still lawless zone.Capitalism worked great until the unaccounted externalities of the natural environment went out of whack. Progressive limits on capitalism’s excesses were mostly laid aside against the foil of “communism,” which was always more an enabler for authoritarian rule.In the main, Zuboff wants us to understand that the wilds of our unattended digital behavioral exhaust have rendered us the unaccounted externalities of the Brave New Economy of surveillance capitalism. We are bought and sold in ways we cannot possibly understand (and even the companies doing the bidding cannot possibly predict or excavate what's happening in individual cases, because the data is too rich and the complex algorithms run on automatic). We are sold for prices that have almost nothing to do with our purchasing behaviors and even the value of the ads. It is our digital futures that have value, just like the economy now works for all the unicorns. It's not like Tesla adds that much more to the reciprocal economy than GM does. It's the futures that have value, robbed from the rest of us, while vacuously promising good for the planet.We don’t even have to buy anything for our behaviors to contribute to a web of predictability soon to be turned to behavioral certainty, to ensnare us in a prisonhouse where everything’s already been decided on our behalf.The trouble is with democracy. Democracy in any form is premised on individuals having fundamental freedom of choice, which Zuboff urges us to understand is the right to our own futures as the results of our personal agency. We have the right to be authors of our own life. In the newly inscribed feudal order where even housing is out of reach, that right has become only theoretical even while technically perhaps still seeming to remain true.The once fictional warnings and celebrations of possible futures – 1984, Brave New Worlds, Walden Two – were written as novels with protagonists. All futures have collapsed, and now here we are reading a near breathless narrative describing what has already happened. I still choose to read it as celebration. If it is read by even a small proportion of our literate population, it will give us back not just our individual agency as the protagonists of our own lives, but it will give us back our collective future as well.The enemies of democracy are not the ones you think they are. The enemies of democracy are within, and we are legion. If human nature is an externality of surveillance capitalism, then what might it look like when human nature goes out of whack? Look at the news, as Joseph Campbell might have said.Read this book!"
191,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11442903-james,4,"https://jamesvirusdiary2020.wordpress...1. How does this cultural product reflect some aspect of the human condition?“Surveillance Capitalism” is somewhat overwritten and under-edited. It’s meticulously sourced and draws from a huge array of sources, from patents filed with the U.S. government to interviews with disillusioned tech bros to conference notes from various techno-utopian gatherings, but Zuboff is somewhat too fond of her own voice to make it a fully immersive read. I’m not sure that a somewhat lyrical, allusive style coupled with interviews and journalism and secondary sources is a weakness in moderation, but by the end of the book I couldn’t stand the ponderousness of her pronouncements about the state of the world and the universe and her burning house and the thickness of the walls in her new house and how much she likes Hannah Arendt.Still, I’d recommend it. Just skim over the paragraphs when she’s repeating her points and dig into the nitty-gritty of how Silicon Valley is not making the world a better place. I work at a STEM high school teaching social studies and I don’t mind using laptops all day so students can look up primary sources and work collaboratively and do a bunch of things that would be much harder on pencil and paper. I do mind the endless insistence on the value of technology at my school. Most people in computer science are not building robots. They’re coding machine learning to suck data out of searches and social media to sell people stuff. Most engineers who graduate from the two most prestigious colleges in my state are not building bridges. They’re building models to frack oil out of the ground or building missiles or building luxury condos downtown. This isn’t cynicism, its living in the world of neoliberalism without the capacity for critique.Given these experiences at the school, her distinction between authoritarianism and the Skinnerian Walden Two dystopia that surveillance capitalism will create is 100% on point. Tech utopias are totally non-judgmental, bro. They want your stuff, not your soul. But your soul and its capacity for critique and the basic ability to be an autonomous, self-reflective individual is constantly under pressure in a world that requires constant engagement with digital tools. These tools value speed, engagement, and buying goods and services. These are the metrics of success in a world without privacy or antimonopoly regulations. There is no alternative to a digital capitalism that is built on colonizing your life to monetize it, except withdrawing from the aspects of the world that are being digitized and surveilled, and that will continue to get more difficult as more things become “smart.” Even if the only ideology of surveillance capitalism is a vague neoliberalism and desire to bow down to machine learning, that’s more than enough to hollow you out if you don’t actively fight it.See you on the other side with my decade-old computer that’s unsupported by recent updates and a flip phone. I’m not dreaming of escaping from this world, but in Zuboff’s words, I’ll keep trying to create as much friction as I can.2. Does this cultural product make me more or less anxious about the world at present?MOREI’ve heard on various podcasts that social media companies should be applauded for their attempts to moderate false coronavirus content and that in this moment they are helping many people to feel more connected and supported. As someone who does not participate in social media outside of virus times, I’m still not participating, and I still feel better about not doing it. After all, if we set the precedent of needing technology companies in these times, especially needing them to give federal or state governments location data to track assholes breaking shelter in place, then we will continue to feel like we need them after this is over. And that’s extremely frightening.Think small businesses never reopening because Amazon and Postmates and Yelp finally complete their takeover of service jobs. Think location tracking of office drones to make sure they are always optimizing and always staying hygienic. Think a boom in online schools as data “shows” that remote learning “worked” during the virus. And think a level of social isolation that a virus could never do on its own."
192,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25867752-zachary-romano-jr,3,"I really wanted to like this book. The ubiquitous collection of data and microtargeting of advertisements is a disturbing trend, and identifying and studying this phenomenon so we can combat it or at the very least go about our lives with open eyes is paramount, especially as the ""internet of things"" proliferates and more and more of our lives are rendered for tech company profits.I've made it about 3/4 of the way through the book, though, and I have a hard time imagining myself finishing it. The ideas here are great, and I do feel like this book has given me a concrete framework to understand how tech companies (and other companies dipping their toes in surveillance capitalism) view the data they collect and the “services” they provide. However, there are a few reasons that I am very hesitant to recommend this book: 1. The concrete harm that surveillance capitalism causes to people living within it is never adequately explained except at either a 40,000 foot view or at the level of extreme extrapolation of current trends to horrifying conclusions. Zuboff sets out to express surveillance capitalism as a sort of successor to piecemeal division of labor in terms of economics and as a sort of (if not successor than) force tantamount to totalitarianism with respect to the shaping of social relations. Theorists of division of labor (e.g. Marx) and totalitarianism (e.g. Arendt, Orwell) make very clear what the stakes of these systems are for those experiencing them at the individual, lived level. Zuboff, our first theorist of surveillance capitalism, never explicitly makes an argument as to why extreme data collection and ad-serving (as it stands as practice in 2020, not when it is carried to its potential extremes) is harmful to us in concrete terms. We're apparently supposed to take just at face value that the observation and rendering of our behavior toward profits for surveillance capitalist companies is tantamount to stripping our bodies of what makes us us and leaving the desiccated husks of what used to be human beings out in the sun to rot (the book is full of over-the-top language like this) and that a Skinnerian dystopia of dictated ""choice"" is the inevitable end result of a process that starts with targeted advertisement unless drastic action is taken. I'm potentially receptive to both of these arguments, but they are arguments, not self-evident givens. 2. The tone of the writing and what is being described do not match. So many times in this book, I was onboard for an argument only to be completely thrown off by a metaphor that came off as ridiculous or completely out of place. Yes, smart TVs listening to your conversations after receiving ""permission"" through a bullshit unread ""contract"" is deeply unsettling, but is it really tantamount to a buzzard picking scraps of meat off my bones?3. Throughout the book, there seems to be an assumption that the reader cannot take an example or a smaller argument and fit it into the book's larger argument on their own. Every time a new point is made, the main arguments of the book, or at least the chapter in which it appears, are rehashed. By the middle of the book, I felt like I was getting maybe two sentences per page that I hadn't read before. Reading this book is experiencing this sequence ad nauseum:- New point or example- Long, mostly obvious rehash of how this fits in with points made previously- Over-the-top metaphor about the doom it portendsThis pattern makes reading even short passages exhausting, and the book is SO LONG. This isn't a data-driven treatise e.g. Piketty. There is absolutely no reason for the book to be this long.As every reviewer has said, this is an important book. It names and defines a phenomenon, and in doing so starts to give us the tools to combat it. Alas, it is not a well-written one. It's a real shame, too, as a skilled editor could have turned this into something much more engaging and impactful by bringing the stakes down to a level that the reader can fit his or her lived experience into, cutting the endless repetition, and toning down the purple prose."
193,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53342522-phil,5,"A stunning, foundational work which weaves research, philosophy, literature and history into a fully realized vision of where we may be headed if current trends continue. Zuboff lays bare the implications of what was (is?) a pervasive view among many so-called Singularitarian and to a lesser extent many of the ""Rationalists"" (by which I refer to the community of people influenced by Yudkowsky and his Less Wrong project) that the human project can somehow be optimized to the benefit of future humans, eschewing messy politics and biology. What at first glance is a noble goal (and presented as a moral imperative) is revealed as a totalizing societal organization that trades individual freedom for guaranteed outcomes.Zuboff begins with a historical contextualization of technology and it's inextricable connection to economics and politics. From there, the ""birth"" of this new form of capitalism is placed in Google's hands with the discovery of behavioral surplus, I.e. the metadata or context of any and all interactions with the company's search product and later across the entire internet and currently expanding into the physical world. ""The corporation thus created out of thin air and at zero marginal cost an asset class of vital raw materials derived from users’ nonmarket online behavior""Related, I had recently read Edward Snowden's memoir which overlaps this point in history where the US government was, in the post 9/11 environment, more than happy to both encourage and protect Google and others as the rise of data accumulation and analytics allowed unprecedented and frankly mind boggling levels of surveillance. The book then goes, in great detail for hundreds of pages the ways this occurs. Many of us know some or most of these methods, but to have them collected and organized is extremely useful and simultaneously horrifying/depressing.The last section, which reflects on what the practical implications of the unspoken and purposefully obscured theories behind many of these companies (and let's be honest most of them are directed by monomaniacal personalities who instill a cult like following in their employees and customers) was to me, the most powerful and some of her quotes were extremely insightful and moving. Specifically, the idea that there are more issues at stake that mere privacy. We have unleashed a great experiment upon our civilization and our species. The sheer hubris that the patterns of a global society can be optimized (to what end, precisely?) is folly. I'm no expert, but the concepts and stages of developmental psychology and how we create our identity and understand the boundaries of self and other are not fully understood and yet we have now begun to raise a generation of children where those boundaries are radically altered. Another idea that resonated with me was that of refuge and sanctuary. As someone who relishes moments of solitude, those moments have become ever more important as the expanse of ""the apparatus"" closes in leaving so few ways to reflect and spend time in the interior life without the anxiety of being seen by others.It is clear that already, (time always feels both so fast and so slow) 2019 has seen a growing tide of awareness and outrage against these trends, but there are so many interrelated issues and it's not clear how to move forward without a vision of where to begin. It's tempting to withdraw and abrogate the responsibility of climate change or poverty or world health to some benevolent dictator (be it the ""singleton"" AI or the philanthropist billionaires) but as Zuboff has eloquently argued, this is not normal, nor is it inevitable.Clearly the power of technology will remain essential in solving these problems, but control must remain in the hands of the many not the few. We must resist and reclaim our destiny. Whatever the future brings, it must be ours to decide. That is our burden."
194,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21519261-mylogicisfuzzy,3,"There is no doubt that The Age of Surveillance Capitalism is an important book and impressive in many ways but I also had quite a few problems with it. The amount of research is seriously extensive (notes in my kindle version take up about 130 pages) and I liked Zuboff's approach, the way she defined processes and elements of surveillance capitalism. There are very clear timelines and historiography. 'Know thy enemy' if you will and all of this is very good. The book mainly focuses on Google, somewhat less on Microsoft and Facebook, then other service providers making headway in what is becoming a saturated market of behavioural data gathering and monetisation in order to influence, control and modify human behaviour for profit. I was happily reading The Age of Surveillance Capitalism and was about 180 pages in, convinced by Zuboff's arguments when a scene in a TV drama made me start questioning the book. Taking place in the late 1980s, a doctor in this TV drama informed his patient that if she wished to do a particular test, this would be immediately flagged up by her health insurance provider and implying that her premium could go up. It made me remember that elements of surveillance capitalism existed long before Google. And while this doesn't make Zuboff's arguments less valid, I started finding them somewhat limited. For example, there is direct evidence of increasing profits at Google, Facebook & co from selling targeted advertising but I would have liked to see an analysis of just one of these regular, long term advertisers and to what extent have their own market share and profits increased since targeting customers via algorithms developed by Google, Facebook, etc. In other words, how many people click on ads and actually buy goods or services? Zuboff, unfortunately, stops with what Google sells. I also found the book incredibly repetitive. Your car's engine being shut down remotely (for example, if you haven't kept up with insurance payments) and without your control is repeated several times to illustrate how your behaviour can be controlled. Twice would have been fine but no need to use the same example 8-10 times in the book. I thought that perhaps 150-200 pages could have been cut out without losing any of Zuboff's arguments. I also thought that Zuboff spent far too much time on Skinner's radical behaviouralism and Walden Two (in which I have no interest whatsoever) and also on analysis of totalitarianism and applying Hannah Arendt's theories to today's surveillance capitalists. There was one chapter where she quoted speeches from heads of Microsoft, Google and Facebook, all basically saying how they want to reach everyone on the planet etc. but it made me think that if we are talking totalitarianism, there can only be one surveillance capitalist reaching (controlling, influencing) us all otherwise it wouldn't be totalitarianism, just market competition for domination. For a book published in 2019, I also thought there was too little analysis of effects of GDPR in Europe and too little analysis of how Facebook membership has changed over the recent years. Like with all trends, there is a massive initial uptake and then a drop off. She mentions this for Pokemon Go for example but hasn't looked at how many people still play Pokemon Go now. FB membership among 18-34 age groups remains pretty high but a lot lower for those over 35 suggesting that many initial users must have dropped off (I looked up these figures, not in the book). So, a good book and an important one but also somewhat limited and way too long."
195,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/110809-leighcia,4,"I heard about this book about half a year ago, and initially decided to not read it due to reviews that complained about bad writing. I decided to give the book a second chance when it showed up on Barack Obama's Best of 2019 Books list (rather ironic, considering his Presidential campaign was one of the first to take advantage of behavioral surplus analysis)Zuboff's writing is dense and heavy on the jargon-side, especially when she digs into her theoretical arguments. It can take a while to get accustomed to it, but this is a book worth reading. Zuboff describes a new commodity in our new age of capitalism: our behavioral surplus (in addition to land, labor and money). She defines it as the data that online/internet-connected services collects, that is beyond what is needed for the service itself. (For instance, a Roomba vacuum cleaner needs to store an internal map of the house for maximum functionality; yet it does not need to share that data with Roomba for analysis... though Roomba may collect it so that one day it can target an ad for a new sofa for your living room) Zuboff elaborates on the development of this surveillance capitalism, from its initial birth at Google, to its current sophistication and creep beyond our computer monitors into the physical spaces of our homes. It compares the advance of surveillance capitalism to colonial conquest-- taking the land, claiming it for its own, and then building the legal justification after (especially as our legal frameworks have failed to keep up). She explores its logic and then makes an incredible strong argument for how surveillance capitalism takes away our freedom, because it has mastered who we are (through the collection of our behavioral surplus) and knows how to behaviorally nudge us (in the spirit of BF Skinner and from the knowledge of Facebook's extensive A/B testing). Her final chapters illustrate the danger of this to our humanity and to democracy (An excellent article in the Atlantic: The 2020 Disinformation War illustrates this so vividly) This book is highly recommended for its theoretical framework and language of the new mode of capitalism that is already so much part of our lives. Zuboff builds her argument of surveillance capitalism's danger to our freedom over time and does so effectively, though I wish she had spent more time talking about surveillance capitalism violates our right to privacy, and does not go into depth in exploring whether and how privacy might be fundamental to human dignity. At times, Zuboff seems melodramatic about the dangers of suveillance capitalism, but I have moments reading the book wondering if I am just a frog being boiled alive, not realizing that the water temperature is rising. So many of us have become complacent and desensitized. I write this review in Evernote, where I can't seem to get a clear read on whether their 2016 privacy policy that permitted employees to read individual notes still exists. I read the book on a Kindle that collects my reading patterns. My Chrome browser for work captures my work research habits, and my Facebook feed always seems to give me the right type of ad. But perhaps, this frog may still jump out of the water yet, or more aptly, organize for cooler waters. I finished this book motivated to advocate for greater privacy protection in our law (and support candidates who do), and finally figure out how to use UMatrix firewall on my web browser. And continue my commitment to not buy a smart appliance or an Alexa. 2 or 3 stars for writing 5 stars for content "
196,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64484002-william-smith,2,"Zuboff attempts to portray technological integration utilising behavioural data as principally wrong, morally unjust, and fundamentally antagonistic to a free, democratic society. Whilst naturally, this should produce concern in the reader, I found her, mainly assertive narrative, proselytised my viewpoint, transforming it from a techno-optimist to a fully-fledged techno-accelerationist probably against her best wishes. In short, the vast majority of this book is redundant, with the same points unabashedly repeated  ad nauseam . Even the first assertive instance of these points neglects any counter-narrative or consideration that the principal foundations of her beliefs - namely the right to privacy and 'sanctuary to be yourself' - while they may intuitively resonate with most of us, could be wrong. I believe even minor consideration of these foundations would have produced a work far more contentious and nuanced.Further, I outright reject her portrayal of behaviourally-driven software like social media or targetted ads as a non-passive mechanism geared by evil capitalistic, neo-liberal engineers. Instead, social media is a passive agent continually construct by behavioural input rather than built to alter behaviour. For instance, analysis of YouTube recommendation algorithms highlights that the reality of 'surveillance capitalism' is more the engineers trying to decipher the autonomous action of a self-improving algorithm guided by its users as opposed to an engineer-driven program tasked with exploiting the naivety of the user. This is not to say there are no instances to which I agree with Zuboff's concern about the nature of behavioural data. For example, I buy the need for concern regarding the influence of targetted-ads in politics and how governments could usurp juridical oversight by using private companies in the name of counter-terrorism or worse. However, I also whole-heartedly acknowledge the remarkable potent potential of online economies, driven by behaviour, to optimise not only markets and consumerism but also the wellbeing of individuals. One example of this, as quoted in the book, is the emergence of affective machines that potentially could optimise and enhance user's happiness by tailoring their experience online. While Zuboff portrays this as exclusively a ploy by ruthless capitalists to pick optimal times for purchasing, the lack of nuance provided in the book to the broader potential of such technology is unfortunate. For instance, affective computing could be used to identify users with mental health problems and fast-track medical care, or, on an every-day basis, improve user's experience in a world continually dominated with an online presence. Overall, this book is most likely for those individuals with little knowledge of the history or putative future of the online sphere. Fortunately, Zuboff does a poor job of hiding her bias shown by the apparent lack of a plausible and much-needed counter-narrative, and all-to-often falls into the problem of desiring the fruits of the market without the price. Also, I think, counter to the author's desires, 'The Age of Surveillance Capitalism' is more likely than not going to induce the appreciation that data-driven markets are a force for good. "
197,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/102650030-sam-dixon,5,"This book is equal parts disturbing, prescient, revelatory, and mesmerizing. Dr. Zuboff casts off the misdirections and veneers with which tech giants such as Mark Zuckerberg, Satya Nadella, and Larry Page have so perniciously clad their operations. A deep dive into seedy politics, black-text algorithms, behavioral psychology, and relevant philosophy of what it means to be a human, Zuboff's work is essential. She explicates how human behavior as it is captured in our internet-mediated activities is dispossessed, analyzed, milked, and twisted into a lucrative product of human predictions. From the Facebook trove of data that can ascertain your sexuality, dreams, preferences, relationships, fears, and material desires; to the Google Maps algorithms that can learn and predict the minutiae of your daily routine and slyly direct you to the places it wishes; the surveillance capitalists' machinations are powerful and aggressive. Facebook and Google are, at the heart of their business models, advertising giants and they comprise a duopoly that has dominated global markets since the nascent 2000s. Every other company (Uber, Twitter, Amazon, Microsoft, etc) is playing catch up - the capitalist game has changed. If you aren't able to capitalize on data dispossession, analysis, and salable consumer insights, then get out of the market. The natural end-goal of this thievery is the establishment of total certainty; satisfying the market needs of the few players who turn the dials. Skeptical readers will hesitate at the pontifications on justice, freedom, balance-of-knowledge, power, and dignity, but Zuboff's arguments are utterly coherent and well-backed. This work is a woven tapestry of bulletproof journalism, scientific study, and philosophical insight that is hard to debunk. Even the most ardent of Hayek/Milton-ian capitalists will find themselves trapped within the arguments and reasoning that the author outlays. But it's not just the methods that matter, it's the effects and the consequences of this vast new system of surveillance capitalism. These economic theories attach themselves firmly to societal and political problems that we see are rampant today: out-of-control misinformation, declining mental health, evisceration of privacy, dissolving boundaries of the inner-self, and the global weakening of democracy herself. Zuboff ties it all together quite convincingly; and anyone who finds themselves unnerved with the trajectories of the 21st century world should start listening in. It is difficult to have read this book and not rant to friends and compatriots about the dangers and horrors all around. It's difficult to feel like a canary in a coal mine without being self-righteous and insufferable. But the task at hand of restoring the balance of power within our economic, legal, and political systems is imminent. These arguments give a springboard for awakening, activating, organizing, resisting, and yearning for better. Let's fight, as the author exhorts, for a ""right to the future tense."""

Surveillance capitalism continues industrial capitalism's model but with a dark twist. Surveillance capitalism takes our private experiences, makes predictions and then sells those predictions to advertisers. Our private experiences are being ""harvested"" without our awareness all under the guise of seamless service.2) The digital boom was supposed to democratize information, expression and production; but, because of surveillance capitalism, big tech firms such as Google and Facebook now hold disproportionate amounts of power. 3) Behavior modification through the technological infrastructure undermines human autonomy. Our ability to act under our own volition is steadily being manipulated the more we are enveloped in technological ""services."" 4) In our relationship with big tech companies, we are actually not the product. We are the free raw material necessary to educate their systems. Just as much as we are searching Google, Google is searching us. If we really were big tech's products, there would be much more concern about our wellbeing. 5) Privacy policies are more surveillance policies. They more dictate how they are taking your information rather than how they are keeping it private. Harboring a private realm is important to personality and growth. When your most intimate details are scanned by others, your sense of self and freedom of will are affected. 6) Big tech companies know almost everything about us but we know almost nothing about them. What do they know? Who decides what they get to know? Who decides, who decides? Their tendency to lie about what they know is also alarming. For example, when Google drove their Google Earth cars all around the world to take pictures of everyone's houses (they didn't ask for permission to do this, by the way), their cars were also pinging wifi routers to scrape personal information. They denied this for sometime until they were exposed by a German tech investigation company. Also, when predictions surrounding our personal data is being sold to 3rd parties, how can you possibly tell what company knows what about you? For example, Google and Facebook buy information from menstrual cycle apps, mental health apps, etc. 7) Last generations luxury is todays necessity. The technological infrastructure helps us to feel like we have many servants. This lifestyle of having many digital servants is now deemed as a necessity. 1-10 Takeaways:1) What parts of human behavior today is the result of direct behavior modification from big tech companies? As big tech companies get better and better at behavior modification, how will the human race change in the future? 2) The United States government has shown a pattern of disregard for its citizen's privacy (Patriot Act). What level of protests would be necessary to convince state and federal powers to change the business practices of surveillance capitalists? "
199,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3030419-fraser-kinnear,5,"I finished this book two months ago, and am still thinking about it. It colored my reading of Snowden's memoir recently, as many of the 4th Amendment right abuses that he sacrificed to unveil we are now simply giving away for the sake of convenience. This includes, to some extent, my own behavior on this website.While the usual suspects - Google, Facebook, Amazon - get most of Zuboff's attention, she also provides some emerging examples of surveillance capitalism creeping into new products, such as children's toys, TV's, and telcos use of our phone data.Beyond pointing out creepy behavior, Zuboff describes the strategies that these businesses use to inculcate markets with these products. They mostly revolve around an ""ask for forgiveness, not permission"" approach (which she calls the ""dispossession cycle""), combined with extensive lobbying efforts to ward off the waves of reactionary regulation that follow. Examples of success (google street view, Pokemon Go!, Gmail) are compared with examples of rare failures (google glass) to form case studies of this practice. Zuboff also makes the effort to ground these events in historical context and political philosophy, making frequent use of BF Skinner, Stanley Milgram, and Hanna Arendt to contextualize surveillance capitalism in a wider historical and intellectual narrative. So while Skinner wrote on Behaviorism and Arendt on Totalitarianism, Zuboff has coined ""Instrumentarianism"", and defined it as the instrumentation and instrumentalization of behavior for the purposes of modification, prediction, monetization, and control. In this formulation, ""instrumentation"" refers to the puppet: the ubiquitous connected material architecture of sensate computation that renders, interprets, and actuates human experience. ""Instrumentalization"" denotes the social relations that orient the puppet masters to human experience as surveillance capital wields the machines to transform us into means to others' market ends. Surveillance capitalism forced us to reckon with an unprecedented form of capitalism.This is pretty paranoid language. Wouldn't simple age-old advertising that's existed for decades (centuries?) fit this definition? I would have thought that Zuboff's biggest challenge would be convincing her audience that all this stuff isn't benign consumerism. Or perhaps a 600 page book on the matter is somewhat self selecting! However, with US election interference, Congressional hearings about Facebook, and the regular drumbeat of bad news about tech in China, I suspect most people are already primed to absorb Zuboff's message: that we're being taken for a ride.I think the topics covered in this book go to the heart of what we'll remember this decade for. And the end result is yet to be known."
200,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3133993-sam,5,"Who knows? Who decides? Who decides who decides?This was a comprehensive book that did a deep dive into how we should all be concerned about the ways in which the data we create every day is collected and used to more efficiently sell us stuff, and ultimately, Zuboff argues, create behavioral modification.My job is to help my organization figure out how to use data to make better decisions. I have seen the ways that counting things, looking at trends, and predicting outcomes can make the organization better. As we look at bringing on more technology that can help us better understand the things happening on a day-to-day basis, I have no doubt that we will have more ability to be guided to a good choice.BUT...I also know how easily that can switch. Without considering the bias of data collected, those trend or predictive analyses can become horribly biased and cause harm to people. Without understanding the secondary uses of data collected by new technologies, people can lose their privacy without even knowing it.A few things that stuck with me from the book:- She talks about how Karl Marx considered how power goes to those that control the means of production. But in a Surveillance Capitalist society, it is not the means of production, but the owners of the means of behavioral modification that hold power - and that is increasingly companies like Google, Microsoft, Facebook, and Amazon. - She says that people don't know what they are sharing, how it is being used, and also people don't know their own preferences. Additionally, apps that offer choices to protect privacy often work less well if those choices are selected. Add to that the long license agreements people generally just accept without even thinking, and we are set up for a system of massive data collection with very little knowledge about exactly what that means. - She talks about how there is no longer any way to be ""off stage"" and to be yourself. She specifically focuses on young people and how things like Facebook are specifically developed to be almost addictive to the user, especially kids and young adults. Prior to this age of surveillance capitalism, you might be able to hide in your room or go on a walk and not need to be worried about being tracked, followed, marketed to, and evaluated. That no longer exists.The book is excellent, it is scary and concerning. It was also very long. That meant she could go into deep detail, but it also likely means not as many people will read it, which is unfortunate. I likely won't stop using most of the services I use because to some degree they are a necessary part of life. It will make me think about the policy I work to set in my own job to have better transparency around the kinds of technologies we deploy, data we use, and decisions we automate thanks to that data. These are conversations we need to have more of, and quickly. Highly recommend others read the book."
201,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12378947-sum,5,"A thoroughly thoroughly fantastically written book that should be read by everyone. It such an intelligent and conscientious book which although has many claims has a rhetoric I more or less agree with as a functional data scientist with a specialism in machine learning. The book is well researched and evidenced; but also from a human level raises so many questions about what being human being in this new age of data and digital connectivity. I had low expectations for this book because I’m a data scientist, what more do I need to know or think about (that I haven’t already) or have on my moral conscience!? Yet there were so many new perspectives, stories and implications, plus philosophical and sociological parallels that I never really considered. This book is about 500 pages so my teeny tiny review does it no justice. But the main premise is how we live in a new age whereby data is the new oil and the lifeblood of so many large organisations which harvest our data with seemingly innocuous goals of offering us better, more personalised services - when actually they harvest our behavioural data in order to tailor ads to us and therefore sell us products. It then also works in a similar way to nudge our behaviours and uses collectivism in order to automate us with what we do. In previous times, we have had the industrial revolution which resulted in us conforming more like well oiled machines and what will the future look like in this new data driven age where we are always ‘nudged’. There’s a concise summary of Facebook’s like button, including its history and how it came to be adopted more widespread. Plus the classic story of how data scientists at Facebook managed to get people involved in the infinite loop whereby they are mindlessly scrolling without realising where the time went. However, technology companies such as google have always appeared to have our best interests at heart and are ‘moral’ companies. And many of us believe that. But we need to be more aware of what this means and the implications that handing over our data has. We can’t actually rely on governments to act as gate keepers for us because tech companies lobby governments as they have deep pockets and expertise to do so (many ex googlers work in the White House and vice versa). Plus regulation is slower than technology and takes a while to introduce which means it can’t keep up with technology - meaning that the gatekeepers to protect us aren’t actually there yet. In Europe, GDPR is a step in the right direction for privacy laws - but tech companies still have so much power, and can have a huge impact on vulnerable populations particularly teenagers. If you’re trying to raise a child in this day/age, understanding the social influences of Facebook is probably as pivotal as controlling what T.V. they watch. A book for us all in the fast changing realm of the 21st century! "
202,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/77887124-paul-clark,4,"Alternating Between Alarm and “Meh” as I ReadI didn’t really know what to make of this book. Shoshana Zuboff says that we have entered a new era, surveillance capitalism, where our data has become the raw material plundered by the likes of Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Amazon in order to predict and manipulate our actions for financial gain.Zuboff makes a powerful case. Facebook and Google stumbled across surveillance capitalism after years without making any money. They are certainly making a lot of money now. And both companies have been getting away with piratical behaviour for a very long time. They are clearly monopolies that should be broken up.I think Zuboff is on slightly weaker ground when she writes about replacing trust with certainty. For example, I have a relative who used to drive like a maniac. Then she got cheaper insurance by installing a go-pro to record her driving. This has forced her to keep to sensible and legal speeds, and as far as I am concerned, it has thereby made the world a better place. Similarly, I would be quite happy to see convicted terrorists or paedophiles monitored round the clock when they are released from prison. There is a trade-off between liberty and security, and I think most people are willing to occasionally trade a little liberty for extra security.But then Zuboff writes about the surveillance state the Chinese are attempting to construct, and that is a nightmare vision. Utopian thinkers much loved by Silicon Valley have a similar post-political vision for a world run by a digital technocratic/algorithmic elite. Like other utopias, it is founded on the mistaken and naïve view that there is a right answer to complex political questions, when politics is in fact about finding ways to manage the clash of conflicting interests. And like other utopias, the techno-utopia will fail. The danger is, of course, that it could do a lot of damage along the way.Zuboff is surely correct to say that democracy is under threat from the new digital oligarchs, who display scant regard for the rule of law or the privacy of others when it gets in their way.She writes brilliantly about the second modernity (now I understand the 1960s) and the vulnerability of adolescents to the pressures of social media. This is one of those books which, by reading it, has enabled me to understand my own life better.All in all, I think Zuboff is right: surveillance capitalism is a threat and it is one that we should take seriously. GDPR may be a pain for small businesses, but it is a necessary step in the right direction. I will get round to deleting all my Google data and to using Duck Duck Go more. I will also make sure Facebook can’t follow me round on Firefox and will resist the internet of things for as long as I can.And those politicians who express the most concern about our digital overlords will be more likely to get my vote."
203,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64943786-alan-d-souza,3,"This book is a work of documentation and theory of how a rogue form of capitalism based on surveillance technologies primarily led by the FANG-M tech behemoths have sought to unscrupulously harvest data, form tilted contracts and create an overwhelming asymmetry of power and information that is causing increasing risks to the very foundations of democracy as an idea and upending conventional human social structures and interactions which would have sociological consequences far and beyond the immediate concerns that are usually present in the media. The author tries to debunk the notion that ""We are the product"". Instead, according to her, we are the resources and the product is our behavioral data which is harvested for us (often in perpetuity, with no oversight and bound under obtuse and intentionally derivative terms of service agreements and coercive exclusionary tactics designed to manufacture consent) to sell to advertisers who are the true customers for these surveillance capitalists.There is some incredible documentation of the rise of these companies right from the dot com bubble until 2018 and it does a good job as a historic guide to the landscape of the rise of surveillance infrastructure through private companies. Beyond that however, it comes off as provocative, alarmist and often implicitly ideologically presumptive. There is little to no discussion in this tome about why privacy is an inviolable and in the few instances it actually comes up, in discussions of often utopian technologist fever dreams arguing against privacy as a concept, the matter is dealt with condescension and an implicit assumption that liberalism, privacy, right to sanctuary are somehow inviolable without any discussion. The book also seems to assume collection of data is implicitly evil, disregarding that a lot of people willingly give their data because they obtain extremely useful services at scales and costs that would be unimaginable without a data processing economy to fund the entire industrial apparatus.The book is an eye opener on the almost mafia like tactics tech companies employ to safeguard their interests at the expense of personal rights and freedoms, even to the extent of trying to modify and nudge human behavior towards a direction that improves their profit margins and how they use their overwhelming advantage in data gathering, prediction and analysis to shape narratives and deflect criticism often with the backing of the US government behind the scenes.However, this book is way too long and repetitive. The author had a bizarre tendency of drifting off into unrelated tangents for chapters at a time - often going in depth into the nature of 20th century totalitarianism which went contrary to the purported narrative of the book that instrumentalism is not totalitarianism. The book could have been one third of it's tome like length of 700 pages and much less repetitive."
204,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21005711-taco-hidde-bakker,5,"Contrary to what some reviewers conjure up, it doesn't seem to me that Shoshana Zuboff's book is a lament for the pre-digital, Fordist market democracy. Rather it is a courageous, informed and at times speculative defense of humane and humanist values in the face of a developing privately-owned tyranny of automated machine processes that secretly (want to) guide the behavior of many toward guaranteed outcomes for the commercial benefits of the few. Freedom is at stake and Zuboff sketches a complex picture of freedom, as developed and fought for through the ages, that cannot be expressed in algorithms. For Zuboff, freedom relates to individual autonomy, the will to will, the right to the (first-person) future tense, and the right to sanctuary. So far, democratic government has offered the best guarantees for such freedoms.Zuboff wonders how democracy could regain control of capital and of the unprecedented concentration of knowledge, talent and information in the private hands of just a few corporations. There are no simple answers to this question and Zuboff does not give much practical advice on the matter. Legal relics such as antitrust and privacy laws are not adequate in the fight against corporate dictators. Equally inadequate are the vocabulary and the theoretical tools to grasp what's really going on and what dangerous directions ""surveillance capitalism"" could take if we continue to allow it to remain untethered of democratic accountability. Extrapolating from the retrospective analyses of totalitarianism into surveillance capitalist's tendencies to steer their enterprises into a regime that Zuboff dubs ""instrumentarianism"" is hazardous and it remains to be seen whether she will be proven right. Unchecked power corrupts and so Google's early wisdom of ""don't be evil"" could be reversed. Zuboff offers a preliminary theoretical framework of the current conditions of the information economy that I, as a layman in these matters, found understandable and helpful. At least, she cured me from my naïve optimism and my belief that digitization 'automatically' benefits democracy. The role of Google and Facebook in the Trump and Brexit scandals should have been a wakeup call, but I had not yet seriously thought through its ramifications. It seems to me that Zuboff's learned account—despite the repetitions, her at times overwrought use of metaphor and the sometimes alarmist-sounding prophecies—, deserves to be taken seriously, genuinely criticized and broadly discussed in the public realm (or whatever is left of it) as well as the privately controlled streams of 'social' media. If anything, let's not fall into the techno-utopian rhetorical trap of ""inevitablism"". A digital future in which democracy flourishes is still possible, despite the current tendency toward an authoritarian, surveillance-based (in the guise of ""free"" services) shareholder-centrist, all-encompassing market cosmos with no exits."
205,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67922490-euen-mcmurry,5,"A fantastically vital and necessary, if often frustrating, read. At her best, Zuboff is scholarly, sharply incisive, incredible at synthesizing multiple fields and ideas, and ultimately incredibly engaging. At her worst, seen in the middle 3rd of this book, she has a tendency to get self-indulgent and let her prose run away from her, spending entirely too long delineating a minute point, backing it up with exhaustive research and argumentation, re-stating her point, and synthesizing said point into the whole fabric of the work. This faltering 3rd is incredibly unfortunate, as it makes what is already a weighty tome nearly unbearable at times, and that's worrisome. Considering just how vitally important it is that we all understand the tactics and end-game of surveillance capitalism, how radically this ideology seeks to alter and control humanity's future, it's disappointing that Zuboff made this such an often-inaccessible read.The final 3rd somewhat redeems the failures of the middle for me. Here, she sets her sights on the current effects of surveillance capitalism, on the real-time, massive attacks on democracy, social trust, and the sanctity of the our individual rights to sanctuary and privacy. What she uncovers is chilling and bracing. The breadth and scope of the changes surveillance capitalists wrought in the scant 20 years they have been operating at full power, combined with the knowledge that they consider their work only yet begun, is genuinely shocking in its banality and perniciousness. The surveillance capitalists end-game is nothing less than a monopolistic, market-driven collective built on the backs of a humanity whose behavior is conditioned, encouraged, and shaped in the pursuit of profit and social control. It sounds grandiose and almost comical in its grotesqueness, but Zuboff makes this realization undeniable through a scorching combination of research, documentation, and synthesis of the evidence, much of which is sourced directly from the quotes and work of the same surveillance capitalists she's critiquing. It's a haunting, frightening picture of the future. Zuboff offers little in the way of a concrete action plan, which would be disheartening, but she undercuts this uncertainty by reminding the reader that all is not yet lost. The surveillance capitalists, despite their best efforts, haven't completely eroded the tools that exist to reign in their power, but they're doing their damnedest. It's up to us, having read this book, to do what we can to agitate and push back, to deny them the pretense of inevitability and divine right to shape the world in an image that serves themselves only. It's a daunting prospect, but it's work that must be done. Doing it will be another game entirely."

Facebook and Google 'star' in this epic drama, with Microsoft and Amazon supporting, with Cambridge Analytica and their like playing the throng of bad cast members with walk-on or small parts.The essence of this very thorough but very readable text is that the new capitalists, epitomised by Facebook and Google, have no interest in their users (those that utilise their social networks and search engines) except in the way that they can utilise their data for free in order to sell it to companies that need to know the future.Through algorithms developed by such harvesters, they can foretell the future that guides product placement, advertising, product development, political parties and all that need to nudge the system.Additionally, they ensure that our lives are no longer free from intrusion, ensuring that every piece of equipment that we use or come near will provide data that thoroughly absorbs all that we do. Like Google maps, all data is swept up and used. This is our data but washed from our hands without our knowledge or agreement (for who can understand the multi-page agreements that we all sign up to to gain some benefit on search engines, social networks or maps?).Of course, the writer provides great detail on the problem but the solution is not obvious. A call to arms, to fight as the world did against the robber barons of the early 20th Century, is made, but the ubiquity of AI and machine learning and the reduction in people needed to yield the sword of the surveillance capitalists means that we have little time or knowledge on which to base an assault. As most of the companies at the top are American and the only real obstruction is government, how can the world rely on the American government, now wholly corporate in intention, to fight this battle?In Europe, GDPR is an assault on the corporate surveillance capitalists, but this has to be driven against a world under the reign of USA-based raiders and Chinese dogmatists that wish to fight on the same terms but with government involvement within their corporate raiders.Perhaps the income inequalities that we all now see will lead to change. From Picketty onwards, this is causing deep divisions in society but the model of surveillance capitalists is to exacerbate the problem. Perhaps, when no one is left to buy the services of such firms, change will happen. In the meantime, we will all need to be fighting a guerrilla war, backed up by the EU and GDPR."
207,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26775538-jason-weill,4,"This is a well-researched, thorough, slightly melodramatic book that is hard to review in early 2019. This book should be reviewed years from now to see just how prescient or paranoid Prof. Zuboff’s observations are.As a software developer with 16 years of experience, half of them at Amazon, some of them working on metrics-driven ad targeting services, I've become increasingly wary of what Prof. Zuboff calls ""surveillance capitalism."" (The author is fond of coining and referring to new terms, an exercise in branding that feels a little clumsy to me.) It's definitely worrying that since Google — a company founded by people who didn't much care for ads — perfected the machines of gathering and mining ""behavioral surplus,"" many other companies gather and sell behavioral data to make use of it in the aggregate. Vacuum cleaners, washers, dryers, and even my microwave can gather saleable data. I might benefit from this data, but I have no expectation of either reaping the benefits or of knowing what companies have my data. This is a major shift from smart devices envisioned just 20 years ago, as Prof. Zuboff mentions, when any computing device was put in the control of the person who purchased it. Today a new generation of users is willfully ignorant of the algorithms that govern the content they see and of the data that companies can keep indefinitely.The book is packed with historical context, economic theory, and corporate history that is generally well-researched, although presented with the benefit of hindsight. Having worked at several tech companies, I believe that even a company as omnipresent as Google is can collect excess data by mistake rather than as a willful business decision; this book insists companies always do the latter. There's also the inevitable question of ""so what?"" If companies collect surplus data and use it to sell behaviorally-targeted ads, as ad-blocking technology continues to be in the mainstream, what will be the real risk to society? The conclusions about the disfavor of democracy and the dehumanizing effect of social media ring hollow. I'm no fan of social media, but I know firsthand that they excel at effecting real-world experiences that no Facebook or Google schema can truly capture.""The Age of Surveillance Capitalism"" is a book that is hard to review in 2019, but it is so well written that people in 2029 will look back at it to understand the early-21st-century turning point when storage became so cheap that Google, and other companies, started to keep and use data forever."

We have been fed a lie, that these will improve every aspect of our lives, and we ate it willingly, asking for every increasing portions. The tech giants did not disappoint, but within their products have left Trojan horses, thinly veiled, that digitize our entire lives, tracking and creating personality profiles for each of us, so that they can better sell to us. It does not stop there however, as that data is then turned to manipulate us to not only buy that which we already desire, but to change our desires to come more in line with that which they want to sell us. This is the frightening picture that Zuboff paints, and it is an unsettlingly convincing portrait of our reality. The power of these companies to influence humanity is what most disgusts me, not only in the Cambridge Analytica scandal that has already begun to be ignored, but also in the propensity to have a deleterious effect on mood shown in the following in a study on FB - ""a one standard deviation increase in likes, links clicked, and status updates was associated with a decrease of 5 to 8 percent in well being, even when taking baseline well being into account."" This illustrates a fact that many already intuit but shy away from-more time online is not the solution to our existential angst, it is the root problem. If any of this rings hollow for you, I recommend that you download your google data file, https://support.google.com/accounts/a... and then go to FB and do the same. The amount of information these companies scrap and sell wholesale from even someone who at one point considered themselves tech conscious is startling. What then can be done? The way things are progressing, we will have no foothold for individual privacy within years, rather then decades or generations. This is a terrifying vision of the future, but I see little alternative, and apparently neither does Zuboff, who mentions only the hope that recent EU laws that may limit the incursion of personal sanctity from further violation. It is my opinion that if a change does come, it will be because society demands it, though it has shown no desire to as of yet. "
209,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62575136-lee-osborne,3,"This is a hugely important book, but unfortunately it's one that I don't think will get the attention it deserves, and one that won't make as much of an impact as it should.The subject matter - the rise of tech corporations monitoring us extremely closely in order to monetise the data generated by our everyday activities, and our complete lack of privacy and protection from them doing so - needs to be publicised extremely widely. Amazon, Google, Facebook etc. absolutely do not have your best interests at heart, and this book explains why, and how they get away with it. It's pretty shocking stuff, enough to make you throw your phone in a river, don a tinfoil hat and live in a shack in the woods. Not many people are daring to say these things, and fight against the avalanche of surveillance in society, and so the author has written a brave book.However, there's a lot wrong with it. It's incredibly long - far, far too long - and it feels like huge sections are repeated over and over again. It's also written in a very dense, very wordy academic style that makes reading it seriously hard work - I took months to plough through this. As a result, I think the book will only reach a very small audience, and the overwhelming majority of Facebook and Google users will carry on ignorantly compromising their privacy and will continue to be manipulated by algorithms they can't see and don't understand. Unaccountable corporations will continue to exploit us and steal away our rights, freedoms and autonomy, because the vast majority of people will find this book extremely inaccessible. The subject is crying out for someone to write a popular, accessible text on the subject, but I don't see anyone doing it.If you're interested in the rise of corporate power and what companies do with your data, however, this is a sobering (if plodding and challenging) read. The conclusion is good, although it doesn't give you many ideas for action. What it does do is point out effectively that we shouldn't accept colossal corporate monitoring and intrusion into our lives as normal. We should't have to go to ridiculous lengths to protect our data, and we should allow our lives to be commodified. What we do about that is still bit of a challenge, though. I feel the three star rating is a tad generous, but two is a bit harsh. In terms of importance, this book is easily five stars, but the execution makes this a challenging struggle to get through, which is a real shame."
210,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13362245-r-davies,4,"I've been waiting to see if I would have the time to review this properly, as I was taking so many notes as I read this book, one which took me several months to finish, but I confess it seems unlikely. Perhaps, because I am succumbing to the inevitablist logic that she says has helped the shadowee influences behind all the data capture and manipulation. I don't see a way to victory. It requires a level of awareness and understanding, that is beyond the numbers of people necessary to push back against this behemoth. And also, here I am, logged into a site through a social media account, adding more information into the ether to be extracted and analysed. Nevertheless, if I ever find time to go through all my notes and try and produce a proper review of this book, I shall. It is in short full of commendably comprehensive research that forms a tightly woven argument about the nature of how data extraction, of our identities threatens to upturn old models of behaviour, where the asymmetry of power becomes so great that it fundamentally threatens our own ability to 'will' for ourselves; a consequence of forces that increasingly know more and more about us, to a level that allows companies to shape our behaviour, well beyond the levels of advertisers under the old way. The appeal of new technology and its rapid rise has allowed them to steamroller through with new assumptions about privacy, essentially saying ""nah, privacy isn't a thing anymore, look at this fancy new product, you get better service if you give us all your data"" making the new digital world seem like a natural, inevitable 'next-step' in our socio-economic existence. The examples that are listed ought to be alarming and shocking ,yet the sheer volume of shit news over the years no longer renders it surprising. I expect companies to be stealing data, and perverting the purposes with which they claim they use it. I have no expectation there will be any force available to stop it. So read if you want to feel appreciably more informed about a very complex and fast changing subject, but also prepare yourself to be depressed. Maybe others are more optimistic than I am, but I don't see how this gets reversed. "
211,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45962741-michael-harvey,4,"This is an astonishing, well-researched, vital, fearless and terrifying book. It is about how big-tech (particularly facebook and google, but many others as well) have stitched up the internet in order to make huge profits. According to the author, this is not just more effective advertising but a calculated assault on basic human liberties - like what to think or how to vote.It all started when google realised that it was offering its services for free but wasn't getting much return on being a great search engine. They discovered that, incidentally as a part of their processes, they had collected huge amounts of data on people. This was gold dust and could be used to target ads. So far there is nothing wrong with that. I would rather see ads that had some relevance to me, if I have to see them at all.However it grew into something much bigger. It became a way of guaranteeing purchasing (and other) decisions which could be sold to the highest bidder. It is all done without our knowledge or consent (have you read the T&Cs to anything recently?) and using behaviourist psychological tactics to cajole, tempt and inveigle us into spending and thinking patterns.Shoshona Zuboff has done her research and manages to keep the outrage bubbling all the way through the book. This outrage is important because we have a tendency to become attuned to whatever is happening around us. As the internet of things expands and the data is cross-checked all sorts of decisions are made for us on our behalf.It sounds like a dystopian novel but unfortunately it's real. A teenager who is having a bit of a downer puts a sad face emoji on their feed and seconds later an advert for an endorphin enhancing product pops up - kerching! The Chinese government love this stuff and use it in order to maintain levels of control over behaviour. All those virtual badges that people collect? In China collecting the right badges can get you privileged access to certain products, travel opportunities and interest rates - or not.I am hoping that she comes out with a book letting us know what we can do about it!"

At that point, sparked perhaps by the Cold War, it started turning up more and more frequently, a trend that continues to this day. Expect that trend to kick into overdrive now that Shoshana Zuboff’s “The Age of Surveillance Capitalism” is out, for hers is the rare volume that puts a name on a problem just as it becomes critical—in this case, the quandary raised by Google and Facebook when they figured out how to fashion the data exhaust of our everyday lives into, as she puts it, “prediction products”: little oracles that anticipate our intentions and offer them up to anyone willing to pay.Photo: WSJThe Age of Surveillance Capitalismby Shoshana ZuboffPublicAffairs, 691 pages, $38“Surveillance capitalism,” in Ms. Zuboff’s scheme of things, is what happens when companies scoop up the data we leave behind as we go about our digital lives and use it to their own commercial ends. Our leftover data trails make up the resource she calls “behavioral surplus,” a by-product that’s key to the success of two of the world’s most highly valued companies, Alphabet (Google’s parent) and Facebook, and increasingly Amazon and Microsoft. This is not news to anyone who reads the papers. What has become news is the shockingly cavalier manner in which these companies (Facebook in particular) tend to treat this resource and the blatantly insincere apologies they offer in response. Ms. Zuboff, a retired Harvard Business School professor, assumes the role of social anthropologist, arguing that this scheme of surveillance and the marketplace it serves pose a threat not just to conventional notions of privacy but to our autonomy as individual beings, and ultimately to a democratic society. And yet, she asserts, it doesn’t have to be like this. . . ."
213,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20051503-kunal-sen,3,"The author presents a powerful thesis to view the new technologies and industries that made a business out of our personal data. She first sees this change in the historical perspective of prior shifts in how we create wealth and value. In the feudal times we discovered the value of extracting wealth by accumulation and ownership of land. In the industrial phase we extracted value out of physical materials and labor. According to the author we are entering a new phase where the largest companies are generating wealth out of our personal information. In a relatively lawless situation, they are not only taking our information without our permission, but finding newer ways where we voluntarily give up more and more of our private lives to be commoditized and turned into profit. Her arguments are strong and her evidence is often compelling. However, it is a book written by an activist, where every sentence is loaded with adjectives and metaphors that exposes her hatred for these businesses and practices. As a result, as with any activist book, it will reach her audience who are already convinced of her argument, but may fail to reach those who are not convinced yet, or trying to make up their mind. While her examples are mostly appropriate, in many cases she takes it too far and I had a hard time accepting them as valid. She also commits the activist’s mistake of almost completely ignoring the true benefits of some these technologies. Thus potentially alienating people who are not already in her camp.I, for one, would have preferred a more scholarly tone and a more balanced portrayal. There is a wealth of powerful thoughts here, but they get a little diluted by her rhetorics and one-sided analysis. This is a very complex subject, and any simplistic analysis will not resolve the issue of whether we are better off with all the information this surveillance system is producing, or we would rather guard our privacy and give up on the benefits. We should also be very careful about equating this loss of privacy with the questionable issue of free will."
214,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/964406-nick,5,"This is an exceptional work of analysis. It guides us through the deceptions perpetrated by the most powerful organisations on the planet and explains the new modes of exploitation that are central to the accumulation by Google and Facebook of unprecedented wealth and power. These people are evil. They are not your friends. These corporations are not interested in connecting you to information or to your friends. While you carry out these activities online they are interested in measuring you and how you behave. Because they now have access to a vast array and an amazing depth of data on so many of us they are able to draw connections that we would not see otherwise. They then sell this data because it can be used to predict our future behaviour, and in many cases it is used to control our behavior.In this process of production, you are not the customer. You are not the product. You and your behaviour are the raw materials that are processed and packaged for sale. You may not be aware of this but you were tricked into it by ignoring the unreadable ""agreement"" that you submitted to in return for what you thought was a free service. Your consent in this process is not informed and it is not ethical. These companies, like all profit-making organisations, are only interested in making more money. They use words like access, freedom and knowledge only to distract us from the fact that we did not agree to having our privacy removed for their extraction of profit. Perhaps the most lasting analogy from Zuboff's detailed survey is that of the indigenous people of the islands in the Caribbean sea who were about to be slaughtered, colonised and riddled with disease by the conquistadors. The Spanish arrived, announcing their god-given rights sanctioned by their king to seize and plunder all they found. Faced with these strangely attired men speaking complete gibberish, the indigenous people had no real experience to compare it to. We are in the same position with surveillance capitalists, and we all know what happened to the 'Indians' after Columbus and Cortes."

One quote of many:""In 2010 the German Federal Commission for Data Protection announced that Google’s Street View operation actually camouflaged a covert data sweep; Street View cars were secretly collecting personal data from private Wi-Fi networks.Google denied the charge, insisting that it was gathering only publicly broadcast Wi-Fi network names and the identifying addresses of Wi-Fi routers, but not personal information sent over the network. Within days, an independent analysis by German security experts proved decisively that Street View’s cars were extracting unencrypted personal information from homes. Google was forced to concede that it had intercepted and stored “payload data,” personal information grabbed from unencrypted Wi-Fi transmissions. As its apologetic blog post noted, “In some instances entire emails and URLs were captured, as well as passwords.” Technical experts in Canada, France, and the Netherlands discovered that the payload data included names, telephone numbers, credit information, passwords, messages, e-mails, and chat transcripts, as well as records of online dating, pornography, browsing behavior, medical information, location data, photos, and video and audio files. They concluded that such data packets could be stitched together for a detailed profile of an identifiable person.""Google called this a single engineer's glitch... but it turns out it was corporately approved and we don't know if it ever stopped. After all, as the author points out, by the time they were taken to court, we were all so happy to use Streetview that we had been ""habituated"" to its use and just as ""Likes"" in facebook are shared with advertisers, and we no longer complain about that, we also no longer complain about streetview and having our residences photographed and posted (and god knows what else.Zuboff talks about a new capitalism that is represented by these new big corporations.

Zuboff is especially critical of Google and Facebook, highlighting numerous incidences where they have ruthlessly sought to take legal control over users’ decision rights when it comes to personal data, in a seemingly lawless and boundless online world. I think at the end of the day, to combat surveillance capitalism, there needs to be pro-user legislation and sufficient regulation in place to protect our privacy and personal information and deter companies from data breaches, and citizens themselves need to fight back and speak out against the unnecessary transformation by big tech companies of human experiences into raw materials for their limitless plundering. Tech companies themselves need to rein in their corporate greed, and take a more ethical stance and goal for the future of the Internet, technology and artificial and machine intelligence. This book is long, flawed and maybe relied too much on quotations, and I disagreed with some points which weren’t convincingly argued, but it’s still a very pertinent and important read, especially when almost everyone’s lives and futures are literally in the hands of money-hungry tech companies. Zuboff asks, just like how industrial capitalism ravaged physical nature, how will surveillance capitalism wreak human nature? Reading this has definitely made me more wary, and I also ask myself, how much information about who we are and what we do do we give up for free everyday for someone else to make money from? How much personal data will be enough for these tech companies to be finally satisfied?"

When Zuboff gets down to the actual story its both alarming and fascinating, but that's after the 100th page. The author is determined to remind us endlessly how well-read she is - she is - but it doesnt make for a well written book. The prose is laboured. This woman doesn't seem to know the meaning of flow, of taking your reader along with you. Instead, the sentences are laboured and points repeated over and over. Its prose that grinds you down. Here's some examples: ""I invite you to rekindle your sense of astonishment as we follow the trail of this second imperative defined by the prediction of human behavior"". - pretentious or what? ""The uncontract is a feature of the larger complex that is the means of behavioral modification, and is therefore an essential modality of surveillance capitalism"". This is dreadful prose. One more: ""This is an unheralded social revolution that is difficult to discern in the fog of utopian rhetoric and high-speed applied utopistics conjured by leading surveillance capitalists and the many communities of practice - from developers to scientists - that enable and sustain the dominance of the commercial surveillance project"". Dreadful. The book could be a fifth shorter - possibly one quarter - and still convey its message. This is as much an editorial failure, as is Zuboff's clunky writing. Despite the book being over long, despite dragging, in references to Orwell, Thomas Piketty, Tom Paine and Hannah Arendt in the books conclusion, Zuboff has no real answers to how we control Facebook and Googles Surveillance Capitalism. The book deserves a 4 or 5 for its important central theme, but maybe just 2 out of five for its clunking over written pretentious prose. You are supposed to carry your readers along with you Shoshana, not grind them into the dirt."

However, I have to say that her views are heavily influenced by her political inclinations, and the conclusion chapter (if not several parts of it) sounds like a political speech or a call to arms. Because she is so concerned with spreading her word, Zuboff also repeats her concepts over and over throughout the book, to the point that one can almost guess what her next phrase will be (which is almost ironic, since she also talks about algorithms of word prediction). These are some of the expressions she uses ad nauseam: ""rendition"", ""behavioral surplus"", ""prediction imperative and prediction products"", ""economies of scale, scope, and action"" (with ""economies of action"" being an incompatible extention of economies of scale and scope, imho) but then ""behavioral futures markets"", ""habituation, normalization and legitimation"", ""division of learning"" (an incompatible extension of division of labor), ""human natural resources"", ""will to will"", the difference between the ""public text"" and the ""shadow text"", ""dispossession cycle"", ""requirements of social participation"", ""the right to the future tense"" and ""the right to sanctuary"", ""radical indifference"" and finally the annoying ""Who knows? Who decides? Who decides who decides?""Still, the examples of sheer data robbery (Google Streetview and Roomba among many) are revolting and speak for themselves, and those make the book really relevant and important historically, for Zuboff provides a very daunting description of where we can end up with all this: a Matrix-sort of world where freedom is an illusion and life is like... a battery. There is no spoon."

Ultimately those are the questions posited by this book to its readers throughout the book with riveting, deeply-researched, and well-thought out discussions of the information-age's version of extraction economy. While most people will view this as a look into the privacy issue, it is more than that, it is a look into how data-mining corporations also want our behaviors. What the author talks about as ""surplus behavior."" From the book: “At its core, surveillance capitalism is parasitic and self-referential. It revives Karl Marx’s old image of capitalism as a vampire that feeds on labor, but with an unexpected turn. Instead of labor, surveillance capitalism feeds on every aspect of every human’s experience.” I know some folks are going to write this book off as another conspiratorial ""sky-is-falling"" tale of dystopian woe right before our eyes. Perhaps. Or perhaps we're going to finally take a look at potential modern era robber-barons (Zuck, Bezos, Gates, etc) hiding behind a façade of philanthropy and goodness (no different than the robber barons at the turn of the last century) and wonder what the hell we gave up within the confines of our own homes via Roombas, Rings, Nests Siris, and Alexas. After all...it's supposed to be your sanctuary. And the government moves to slow to protect it...even if they actually wanted to. RIght now, I'm in the middle, but I'm paying attention to that latter position and this book helps me think about all the cyber-canaries in the digital coal mine. If nothing else, this book gives you an opportunity to do some deep self reflection and decide what you give up, and to whom. Which was the thesis of this book: Who knows? Who decides?

There was a catch, however: No one knew that the Nest Secure actually had a microphone inside it. Google claims the microphone “was never intended to be a secret” and “has never been turned on,” but it’s hard to shake the feeling that hidden mics are a natural step for Silicon Valley giants intent on collecting as much data as possible, no matter the cost to user privacy.This episode is a perfect encapsulation of the digital threat outlined in a new book by tech critic and Harvard Business School professor Shoshana Zuboff, The Age of Surveillance Capitalism: The Fight for a Human Future at the New Frontier of Power. First published as an essay in a German publication in 2014, what Zuboff describes amounts to a new economic logic hatched in corporate America that aims to extract staggering value from users’ private lives. Cataloguing a dizzying array of sensors and invasive software, Zuboff sketches a vision of the economic future in which companies race to collect data in pursuit of Facebook- or Google-like profits.Zuboff, who published her first book in 1989 on the future of technology and data in the workplace, warns in Surveillance Capitalism of a “seventh extinction” that threatens to eradicate “what has been held most precious in human nature.” Given the fragility of the global political and economic order, surveillance capitalism amounts to a “coup from above,” Zuboff argues, an assault on democracy by way of subverting the very idea of what it means to be an individual.""http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/0..."

Zuboff does an outstanding job of describing the evolution of surveillance capital over time, its methods of tightening its grip on society (the dispossession cycle), and the threats it poses to our minds, freedoms, and futures. Zuboff also paints a vivid picture of a terrifying future by juxtaposing surveillance capitalists with Hannah Arendt's work on totalitarianism. Finally, the book is almost lyrical and phenomenally written, a remarkable feat for such an academic tome.I'll add, however, that I find it strange that Zuboff has written such an overtly political book in which she seems disinclined to attack what I would argue are the roots of these surveillance mechanisms. Here, she rails against neoliberal economics, totalitarianism (or any system that unfairly impinges on individual freedoms), socialism and communism, the unfettered gilded age and its robber barons, and of course surveillance capitalism, but seems disinclined to diagnose the origins of surveillance capital. Tentatively, she seems to point the finger at (1) unjust and antidemocratic power structures and (2) neoliberal economic policies. I would, however, argue that surveillance capitalism is the culmination of capitalism and a natural result of its dogma, not an aberration arising simply from poor regulations and the rise of neoliberalism. Perhaps this reticence stems from a scholarly desire to maintain whatever modicum of neutrality one can in such a work. If that, however, is my only criticism of this otherwise outstanding book, it's a small one. I thoroughly enjoyed this and would highly recommend it to anyone who owns a smartphone."

Can we safely train AIs on these data sets while respecting the integrity of people? So far that’s a BIG no. So how does democracy fight back and direct the story to benefit all, rather than a select few at the top of these surveillance capitalism companies? And can we compete with China (training AI’s) with massive data sets if we limit or curtail the most egregious privacy issues? Of course the FAAMGs would say no, but at what cost to our society and humanity?

We are used to hearing warnings that we are in danger of sleepwalking into a surveillance society. Zuboff makes a compelling case as to why we're already there, and it's not the 'Big Brother' state that's herding us into the digital corrals, but a small network of surveilance capitalists with tremendous power at their disposal -- Big Other as she calls it. This book is very much an urgent wake up call; we need to make a stand and secure our very right to be autonomous human beings.But there's the thing. This isn't about our rights; they're irrelevent to these emerging capitalist hyperpowers. Behind the new technnology, the data harvesting and behavourial analysis that drives the push for 'smart' everything, is an age-old logic of power and profit. This isn't about our privacy; it goes further than that.There's a common saying that if a digital service like Facebook is free then you are the product. On the conrary, Zuboff argues convincingly: we are not the product, we are simply the rock and soil from which the ore of valuable behavioural data must be mined, refined, and sold. The customers are those who can make a tidy profit from knowing us to the core of our being.Zuboff makes a chilling analogy, here: we are the elephant's carcass left to rot after the poachers have taken its life -- simply to steal its tusks for ivory. Remember that, next time you feel like clicking like.This book is an essential read. It's a timely warning to be on guard and resist while we still can.

So we're supposed to believe personal data has driven the growth of Google and Facebook because their respective revenues grew after they switched business models? Are we really accepting n=2 studies with 1 variable under consideration? Their user base grew orders of magnitude larger in that time, which might also be a factor? Oh but we have established methodologies for teasing these things out-look to any of the top Management Journals. The observation that big tech inherits the de-regulation ethos of Friedman and Hayek, while maintaining centralised infrastructure that Hayek would have despised is pretty interesting. But Peter Thiel also observes this with the more pithy ""Big data is communist, crypto is libertarian"".Yeah I wasn't convinced by any of the analytical tools and was shocked by the lack of depth. Thanks for the xmas present though mum."
226,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67163245-landis,2,"I remember sitting in a graduate class on Lacanian thought in the 90s. A student was shocked that this highly original and dangerous expounder of psychoanalytic thought seemed to be suggesting, in the essay we were explicating, that the victim of a crime was precisely equally guilty in their own victimization as the perpetrator. Any such suggestion would be easy to misconstrue, distort, or sensationalize. What can't be misunderstood is the nugget of philosophical truth at the heart of this view. My criticism of Zuboff's thought rests on this Lacanian insight: despite Zuboff's portrait, it just isn't the case that we are all innocent victims of surveillance capitalism's machinations (any more than Faust was completely innocent (und wie Frau Zuboff, übrigens, das goethesche Meisterwerk so grundsätzlich bei dessen Lektüre hätte missverstehen können, muss hier leider eine unangetastete Frage bleiben). On the contrary, we are co-creators. Imagine a version of Zuboff's book that had started with that claim, or, better yet, that had started with a sort of Handkean ""cursing of the audience"" and chided us, the consumers, for what _we_ through our laziness had done to democracy. The product would have been a much more intellectually challenging, and honest, work than the disingenuous pseudo-manifesto that Zuboff offers. Google and Facebook are no different from their consumers: both sides are getting away with as much as they can until someone stops them. They both are enjoying. They are both choosing the means of their enjoyment and they are both sharing a mutually agreed upon space. Nous ne sommes pas aussi innocents que vous nous imaginez d'etre, Madame Zuboff. Vive le Sade!"
227,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11025595-gary,5,"You will not look at any interconnected technology and services the same way after you read this book. All the connected tools we use in our lives from the apps available to us, online searches, the smart house, the smart body (fitbits) to smart cars, it's all about collecting your behavioral data to shape your thinking. And the cautionary point in this book is to point out that with the new technology tools available now with the internet, AI and devices, your thinking can be shaped without your conscious agreement. Other fascinating and unexpected learnings from this book is the impact of these new connections on young minds, whose socialization used to be in a small communities and now is in a 'hive' (as Zugoff calls it) structure constructed not by the family who holds the best interests of the child at hand, but by companies whose interest is in their ability to ultimately sell products or data about the child. The book also covers philosophy (privacy, individualism, self) and governance. A deep dive into the motivations of so many apps, services and devices and an amazing breadth of description and impact in so many aspects of our lives. I believe it's an important read for those who work in connected technologies or in any area (such as law) that deals with privacy. And also to my surprise, if you have young kids and can make it to about the last third of the book, you'll find it eye-opening as to how the technology can affect children. It's not an easy read (I did the audio book) but you will never ever look at your connected devices and services the same way. "
228,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31199867-amni,4,"This book could've easily gotten 5 stars had it not been for its needless repetitions of the same points over and over again. Granted, every time Zuboff repeats a point she says it in a different way, but one can only endure so much of it. The (very) good thing about the book is that it's well-researched and beautifully written; Zuboff combines analytical methods from different domains such as philosophy, economics, sociology, and linguistics, combining evidence and conjecture with grace and style. She uses analogies and metaphor with the skill of a published novelist, which makes some parts of the book vibrate with energy. Her tone is impassioned but commanding-- when she doesn't know something she admits it, but when she knows something she proclaims it like the messiah that she is.I also like that Zuboff broke down each chapter into short subchapters that spanned two or three pages. But I didn't like that most of the meat of these subchapters are spent explaining again what has been explained many many times before. At first I thought that the repetition might help with retention, but as I read further I found my tolerance for them quickly wore off.It could've been 50% shorter and it would still have the same impact, if not more. In the few subchapters where she doesn't repeat anything-- the one on totalitarianism for example, was a real pleasure to read.Taking all that into consideration, I'd still say that this is one of the most important books of our age. We live in a time where a new kind of power is rising, and this book arms us with all the defense strategies we'll need to protect ourselves and fight back. "
229,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16183477-milo-bel-evi,4,"Important, brilliant, and at the same time somewhat flawed and definitely one-sided book with a lot of amazing points, but also 'poetic prose' and hyperboles that ruin the overall feel and weaken the arguments somewhat, and important parts of the picture that are missing.There is no economic analysis or discussion around the actual data at all. No some sort of a cost-benefit analysis for society – the giants like Microsoft, Google of Facebook also empower many individuals, businesses, and communities (besides having the many downsides that are very in the focus of the book, and are sometimes exaggerated). Another aspect that's missing is a more technical treatment of Machine Learning. The way the book addresses these topics is rather poetic, dark vision of the world where ML (that's basically working like some sort of black magic) takes over the human existence where prediction becomes influence, and through a web of nudges in a world where everything is connected, a free will becomes a relic of the past. And Zuckerberg and Nadella are Conquistadors on a slaughtering spree (a metaphor actually used in the book).However, I would still warmly recommend reading the book and it's (maybe too many) pages.I would love to finish with a quote from a review by another Goodreads user:""There is love poured into these pages, love of humanity in its culture and its unpredictable freedom, and that in itself makes the book worth the investment. At the same time though, there's little love for Google or Facebook or technology in general -- and quite a lot of fear, uncertainty, and doubt."""
230,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/113183670-emily,2,"I picked this up because I think it's really important to understand what tech companies are doing behind the scenes in our daily lives. I think the information presented in this book is very good, and it brings up several good arguments about how these ultra-powerful surveillance capitalists came to be and what that means for society and our lives, and why we shouldn't just sit around and accept the fact that it's happening. Despite the bad rating, I would still recommend people read this, because these companies capitalize on the lack of knowledge the average person has about what exactly it is they are doing, and this is a very sharp analysis. Zuboff writes about how companies like Google, Facebook, Microsoft, etc came to be and why existing ideas about privacy and monopoly don't accurately describe this new phenomenon. The American government cannot adequately respond to companies developing at the speed the tech world moves for several reasons, including checks and balances and asymmetry of knowledge. She argues that these developments are not inevitable, and instead are crafted by human beings, which is important if anything is to be done about stopping the normalization of the way they violate our ways of life, including the right to make decisions and act on free will (important !!).That said, the book is very badly written. Zuboff frequently uses very long and inappropriate metaphors that detract from the point she's trying to make. Also, it's way longer than it should be and is very repetitive at times. It would be way better if she just gave us the facts and the reasoning behind her argument, and cut out the drama."

In fact I had to borrow it three times from the library as it was very dense, incredibly erudite, and so completely depressing and terrifying that the breaks between reading were essential.The author has outlined the nefarious rise of what she calls 'Surveillance Captalism' in such detail it almost beggars belief. I am definitely one who is suspicious of social media and unaccountable profit-seeking giants like Google and Facebook, but my suspicions were turned into bald-faced fear by this book. Ultimately, if we continue down the path we are going, the Borg from Star Trek are going to seem like our nearest and dearest cousins. It sounds unlikely? Then listen to, or read this book. You'll realise that it isn't unlikely at all. Without our even realising it, and thanks to our inherent desire for an easy life with everything convenient, easy and driven by an app of some sort, we're well on the path to the death of individuality.I think the most chilling thesis of the book was the recognition that what we are losing is sanctuary. At no time of our lives, waking or sleeping, will we not be observed. 1984 was just an early precursor. Again, don't believe me? Do you wear your fitbit to bed? Does it record your heart rate? Sleep patterns? Is your smart TV on all the time? What about your Google Home? Who do you think is at the other end of that? That's right - a large organisation who is looking for every way to make profit out of you and the data you are willingly feeding them every moment of every day.I can't say I enjoyed this book. I was definitely chilled by it."

Tech behemoths tracking every move of the modern ape from the ubiquitous social media platforms to smart homes to smart toothbrushes; mapping every behavioral aspect and selling it off the highest bidder for this data .

Anyone who values person freedom and privacy should read this wonderful exposé.___Google, Facebook, Apple, Amazon and their wannabes are the main practitioners Surveillance Capitalism. They steal your info when you use a smartphone, tablet, laptop or computer. They gather info from your smart utensils, smart wear, smart apps, and when you ask online for help or directions.

234,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7287435-michael,5,"I'm giving this five stars, because it is a good book, but mostly because everyone should read it. I do have to say that its strength is its weakness, however, in that the book is not always the easiest read. What I mean is that some people have pointed out that Zuboff could have used an editor, or at least a better editor, and this is true. The book is unwieldy at points, and as much as I wanted to read it, it took a long, long time for me to finish, because at many parts it is repetitive and not especially clear. But this is also its strength. A lot of non-fiction works like this only have a few points to make and then they endlessly repeat themselves and reinforce their points with (often boring) data and studies. Not so with Zuboff. While she does refer to studies, she never shies away from poetic meanderings and philosophical arguments, and I for one appreciate that. So in that regard, I am glad her editor (or lack thereof) gave her free rein. All that being said, this book is terrifying. Everyone should read it. I can't really say it's an eye-opener, as I was aware of most of what was in here, but it is definitely an occasion of self-accusation. How do I let all this stuff in my life when I know the great evil that it portends? (And of course, I am tracking the books I read on this site). Most argumentative books fail when it comes to recommended action. This book is no different, but from the tone at the end, I don't think she even pretends to have a solution. The book is meant as a call to arms, plain and simple. "
235,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5385249-jonathan,4,"Want to give this book both 5 stars for Zuboff's message and 3 stars for the actual writing in this book. Her model is pretty sound and her warning is important - but I just can't recommend anyone sit down and read this book. Find a summary or ted talk. It is way, way too long, and with too many dramatic references to Homer or the Conquistadors or whomever that you will probably find distracting as I did.The message is essentially as follows. The emerging structure of our lives being increasingly mediated by ubiquitous smart technology amounts to a massive centralized ""instrumentarian power"", which is characterized by a vast & hidden universe of suggestions, nudges, logs, profiles that are astonishingly good at predicting your behavior. Consider instead of seemingly trivial ads you see and suggestions you are presented a sinister power that is centrally controlled by few, and could be wielded towards interests that aren't ours, without our knowledge. We've seen enough evidence that is is possible re Facebook and elections, and the cynical will point out that the capitalist incentive is already there to manipulate. Whose interests does AI serve? is the key question.Zuboff believes our very humanity is at stake. I don't think we are in grave danger yet, but it does seem like we are saved from a precipice today by the voluntary decisions and internal policies of our largely benevolent tech peers and leaders. This is a scary take because it means we could be one economic downturn away from....something bad but hard to predict."

Here I am, typing into goodreads my views on this book in the full realisation that this data will be used to serve me up more of the sort of stuff I read and also add to the unseen simulacrum of me that big data is constructing somewhere off in the cloud. Ah well.Shoshana Zuboff has a written a very good book here, summarising where we're at with big tech and also warning of our collective future, one, she argues, likely increasingly eclipsed and determined by Big Other whose reach extends into our homes and psyches. Having discovered a business model that relies on behavioural data we generate, initially this has been used to serve us up adds for things we are likely to buy but in the near future, the internet of things will allow big tech to influence our behaviour and possibilities in more profound ways yet still. She points out that we are living in an age of low trust, both with each other and with our governments, ""in its absence the authority of shared values and mutual obligations slips away. The void that remains is a loud signal of societal vulnerability. Confusion, uncertainty, and distrust enable power to fill the social void. Indeed they welcome it"". Her repeated mantra (she sounds like a Bennite from Harvard, if you can picture that) she gives us a script to repeat when considering the claims and banalities uttered by the likes of Mark Zuckerberg: Who knows? Who decides? Who decides who decides? The answers to the questions are increasingly disturbing when placed alongside the fact that most of the world seems to be now [at least formally] governed either by authoritarian regimes, a la China, or else by rich nincompoops allied with big business.Forewarned is forearmed. Zuboff thankfully hasn't given up on human agency and the magic of humans conceiving of alternative worlds. It's a blessing she bestows after offering up 525 pages of an otherwise sobering critique of our current iteration of capitalism. My favourite read of the last year."
237,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9590503-jeanne,2,"The book puts into words (many words) the quiet discomfort the masses are feeling with Google's & other big tech's irreverent domination of the online world, which leaves people with no path of exit. The strength of the book is precisely in this - giving this phenomenon lexicon. It's value is that it exists, and will probably be a seminal book in the surveillance tech space for a while. The other strength is that it is incredibly well researched (some sources are questionable), which reveals the immense research effort Zuboff had committed to this endeavour. But the weakness is execution. At 525 pages it is very long for the narration of a concept that readers are likely to be fairly familiar with. Yes, Google started with search and needed to monetise. And now it wants more data and doesn't care about you. -- did we really need 500 pages for that? The middle part of the book was a real drag because i didn't gain much more insight, and felt like Zuboff was posturing to push her theories into serious academia space. I enjoyed the little snippets of Google's misbehaviour, but I often had to tolerate 50 pages to get to 1 of those. Many sections felt like fillers too. Did I need to know how the lavender fields smelt like on a particular summer day in Spain? Perhaps I should be giving Zuboff more creative license, but there was quite some fluff and battlecry rallying going on, which mildly distracted and discredited the book for me. Unfortunately I couldn't love this more. -- 2/5"

It's not the easiest to read, and from time to time borders on a screed, but it addresses the growing dissatisfaction that more and more are expressing about the underbelly of the digital economy. Many of the those concerns shared are superficial but this book goes very deep: it is very well researched and its scholarship is evident. The author correctly refers to the ""digital economy"" as the ""surveillance"" economy, in that the meteoric successes of the likes of Google and facebook, and others, lie in their monetizing the personal information we unwittingly surrendered without being aware of what we were doing. Despite the growing externalities created by these companies, most consumers continue to be indifferent which is allowing for a chipping away at the core elements of democracy and capitalism that we've taken for granted. The concern is that we will all wake up an entirely new reality when it may be too late. In the last chapter the authors mentions the world's movement away from democratic norms and a softening towards dictators and authoritarian regimes, something that's been addressed ad nauseum ever since the Trump election. But she connects the role that these surveillance companies have played in this chipping away process. I'm a bit surprised there hasn't been more coverage and discussion of this book, but I expect it will grow with time. "
239,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91389981-david-walsh,4,"Capitalism has been through many stages in its existence during the past several centuries. Up until the 21st century, what defined the practice of capitalism was the way in which the spoils of commerce were shared between two sources of value added; namely, those supplying financial capital (to build plant, purchase equipment, and hire workers) in the manufacture of goods and services, and those supplying human capital (workers) to manufacture these products.However, the nature of capitalism has dramatically changed since 2000 through the enhanced ability to extract value from a new third source of value added; namely, the knowledge and modification of individual human behavior. Through our use of smartphones, Google, Facebook, and other services, we have allowed the developers of these resources to leverage information about our lives and behaviors and monetize it by selling it to others in the pursuit of greater profits or political influence.The book “The Age of Surveillance Capitalism” shows us how every use of these “free” online resources provides information that can be used to influence our decisions for someone else’s benefit.The value obtained by profiting from this third dimension of value added is transforming the influence of capitalism in the conduct of our lives. We must become mindful of its existence in order to lessen its impact in making decisions about what we buy or what we think."
240,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13561867-ben-clark,3,"The Age of Surveillance Capitalism is an important perspective on the current digital age, even if it can be overblown at times. Zuboff coins a lexicon of new terms like 'data exhaust' and 'instrumentarianism'. The crux of the argument is that the data gleaned from our behavior online, and increasingly in the 'real world' is being packaged and sold in ways that are hard to control to any number of companies who will use it to show us ads. But potentially more concerning is that the data will also be used to predict our future behavior. Through algorithms these predictions we are shown more of what we like and less of what we don't like, our emotions get manipulated towards more extreme reactions, and we are more isolated from opinions that differ from our own. Often, we don't even realizing that this kind of manipulation is happening. There are no rules about how we are manipulated. The policies are set by the same tech giants who do the manipulation. Some of the horrors revealed in the book include 'zombie cookies' that respawn after a user attempts to delete his record of online behavior, and Amazon using recordings of people using their Echo devices for training purposes without their knowledge or consent. Zuboff often gets carried away with her coinages and grand theories of sociological change, but at the core, this is an important message that we need to reckon with.  "
241,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5626560-lauren,5,"When I've discussed current surveillance practices of online platforms (whether search or social media) with students, I often encounter an attitude of inevitability. This inevitability is somewhat frustrating for those of us barely old enough to remember a time before it felt this way, and I often end up agreeing with them because I too feel powerless at times. Inevitability is the first of several traits Zuboff identifies in the new social norms that clearly signalled to me how thorough her understanding and theorizing is of this new form of capitalism. The scope of this is impressive and warrants the 500+ pages (excluding notes and an exemplary index). I came of age while all of these historical moments came to pass, and I remember thinking, especially of Facebook, that it could have been radically different if the profit imperative weren't the driver...lol.I plan to use parts of chapters from this (3,10,16) to supplement a syllabus on algorithms and bias for a first year seminar where we're reading nearly all of Cathy O'Neil's Weapons of Math Destruction. Though I find Zuboff's writing clear and accessible, I realize it's a stretch for college freshmen because there are marxist terms that her audience would most likely find familiar but a strictly general audience would not.Most engaging theory on inequality leaves me renewed to get angry, find agency, and do something. Zuboff's book, especially those last two chapters, accomplished just that."

This book is long, I must admit. And dense. With big helpings of economics and philosophy. It was a bit foolish to borrow this from the library in the middle of a busy summer. But so it goes. I did read it, however. So should you.In this book, Dr. Zuboff writes about a concept she calls surveillance capitalism, a practice that ""...unilaterally claims human experience as free raw material for translation into behavioral data."" In other words, they're watching you and profiting from it. Companies are gathering all sorts of data from your online interactions--data you intentionally post online as well as data culled from your apps nd devices. They can then crunch the info to not only throw ads back at you but also to try and influence and manipulate people. ... Okay, that's basically advertising, but some of the idealists out there aren't just looking for the bucks. They'd like to reform society, make it more predictable and controllable. Like I said, the book is dense. But even though Dr. Zuboff is way smarter and erudite than I am, she did manage to use examples and metaphors to help me slog through the big words and concepts. She paints an overwhelming picture, but also points back to past times when society was similarly confronted with new paradigms. Check it out."
243,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46127617-karen-adkins,5,"This book takes a step back from the usual critiques of the world of social media and digital technology. Zuboff, as a scholar of business and economics, focuses on the ways in which these industries represent a crucial and dangerous modification of the rules of capitalism. Put vulgarly, in surveillance capitalism consumers become not just the product but the raw material (our attention is what is commodified), and the dynamics of this process are mostly opaque to us, and constructed in ways that detract from the ostensive aims with which we too often succumb to technology in the first place. This is an incredibly vulgar summary; I'm not doing justice to the sweep (chronological, theoretical, empirical) of the material that Zuboff covers, often times exceptionally lyrically. She reveals how impoverished resistance movements like ""Own Your Data"" are in view of the depth and breadth of surveillance capitalism's reach.To be clear, this book is a doorstop. And while Zuboff has had a career that can only be described as remarkable, there were times when some of the autobiographical asides or theoretical detours seemed like more detail than I needed. But the argument feels essential for our time, and for readers. Her conclusion invokes Thomas Paine and Hannah Arendt, and in no way reads as panic-mongering. She is issuing a call to resistance that should be reckoned with and joined."

It is powerful with its examples and introduces very important conceptual frameworks that allow us the language to discuss what is going on. Everyone should read this book.However there are also flaws with this book. For example I would like to know more about the actual costumers of the behavioural surplus Google, Facebook, etc are harvesting - what motivates them? Do they understand what they are doing? How do these second order markets work? Some interviews with relevant firms (eg marketing firms, etc) would have been interesting and the book could have devoted more to this.Where the book could have done less is the pages after pages devoted to intellectual history/conceptual analysis of surveillance capitalist ‘philosophers/historians/etc - quite often it was unclear where the argument was going and it did not add to the very powerful messages of the book. Instead, I am sure many readers will get lost at those points, diluting te impact of a book everyone should/must read.Lastly, what was missing is clearer indication how we can reverse surveillancr capitalism. Pressure on government to regulate ruthlessly? Break up the big companies? Nationalise them? A call to arms is good - but it would be good to know where to start..."

Just how many times in how many ways can you use the words ""milieu"", ""second modernity"", the ""right to will"" or the ""right to the future tense.""Which is really unfortunate because I don't disagree with many if not most of the conclusions. I appreciated the deep research, the concrete examples an especially liked the passages towards the end discussing the influence of BF Skinner. I felt she spent too much time characterizing the collection of 'behavioral excess"" data as lawless personal theft and not enough on the resulting use. Shocking more time wasn't spent on Cambridge Analytica -- arguably the apex of of the dangers she's trying to prove. Also surprised there was no consideration or analysis of voices within the industry calling for regulation by the government. Similarly -- and maybe I was too glad to get to the end to notice-- but I didn't notice much in the way of practical solutions other than to simply ""resist."" Bottom line -- an excellent essay undermined by length, tone and focus. Could have calmly laid out all the facts and led to the same damning conclusion.

Zuboff lays out a fascinating history-rich status of the twenty-first century and the digital landscape, tracing its roots to a late-stage neoliberal capitalism that big tech companies today deploy with complete abandon. Her analysis and examples of how big data is used and how the idea of the individual and the individual's privacy are slowly being turned into public information are all quite sound, and her pragmatic outlook on the world today is striking to behold.But for all of that, I can't read any more of this. There's just so much information in here that makes me want to weep at how exposed and naked we all are online nowadays, how much information we've given up, often unknowingly, to big companies like Facebook and Google especially, and just how far past the Rubicon we have truly run as a society. Zuboff does offer glimmers of hope in drastically overhauling our privacy laws to be in line with how the worldstate is, but honestly this book just made my paranoia and fear buttons go haywire. And I don't need that right now.I'll probably return to this at some time in the future, but for now, I'm shelving it. It's a great book, very well written and expertly researched. But use your judgement about how much doom and gloom you can handle during everything else happening in 2020."

It took me quite a while to finish because of how much research and diversity of thoughts there in in the book. It explains how surveillance capitalism works - the harvesting of behavioural surplus from user information, user data, user browsing data. How surveillance capitalism undermines self-determination - from the behavioural surplus there come predictive products to pre-empt consumer behaviour. How surveillance capitalism is also an issue of power asymmetry - companies operating on an unprecedented scale possessing both the knowledge and unbridled freedom (because regulation hasn't caught up), versus individual users who are just powerless against the bulwark of techno-giants. It gets dystopian at times to think about how much social media have already done to wreck the sanctuary of our lives. Like it or not, Facebook/Google have already collected tons of data, mindless scrolling of Instagram is an addiction. Social media exploit our desire for belonging, for affirmation, for attention, and justify behaviour modification on the basis of user experience. Sure, no one denies the positive aspects from a connected world, but this book shows that we are not prepared to deal with the consequences. All power corrupts men - the power of social media companies is the next one on the agenda, if we are still committed to the cause of democracy. "

I am not against capitalism but I do believe there are always extreme to everything and Google is pretty extreme on how they generate their revenue. I never knew how profitable it can be to gather data from surveillance and make then turn that data into something useful for marketers or politicians. This book leans heavily on how what Google is doing is ""wrong"" and it appears that they are just getting started. Although this is one side of the story that is important to recognize and understand, the ""surveillance capitalist"" believes in what they are doing is good. I have read books by Eric Schmidt who is referenced many times in this book and gather that he is doing his job and believes in the mission of Google. I think that surveillance has been going on for a long time and technology is making it easier, more accurate, and more profitable. This book is so dense on its subject matter where at some points it feels like the author is just beating a dead cat and you get ""the point"" that what is going on is pretty bad. But the author is just relaying on all the research she did and I am sure she still had to cut out a lot out of the book."

And then in 2004, in an internet cafe in Libya, I learned that Gmail was on the horizon: sign me up for that! And as the years went by I often thought, how are they making all that money from searches and emails? This book has the answers to those questions and much more. It's not an easy read, mostly because Prof. Zuboff has identified a phenomenon which has not really been forensically delineated until now, and she needs a whole new vocabulary to describe it. The first hundred pages or so, I had to frequently put the book down, to process what I was learning; (the good news is, it gets a bit easier thereafter. Essentially, Google, Facebook, and Microsoft hoover up all the ""data surplus"" from your internet life, and use it, in ways that are kept from us, to predict your needs for advertisers. We all knew this with regards to searches and emails, but it's social media as well. And why do you think Android is cheap? Because it's just one big hoover for your data. And don't even get her started on the Internet of Things...!Anyone who uses the internet and wants to stop human life from getting any worse really should read this. Better still if someone could write a shorter, punchier version. But as it is, it's worth the hard work. "

It should have been my cup of tea. I'm a lawyer who hates being advertised to, has unsubscribed from all social media, turned off Google tracking, and about a year or two ago even went down a crazy rabbit-hole of removing myself from 'aggregators' like Spokeo, Avvo, and a dozen or so other websites on the Reputation Defender website (even though I'm pretty boring and probably nobody was looking for me anyway).I got about a quarter of the way through this book before I had to put it down. The book itself is a tome, but that's not a problem for me. The problem was the reason that this is a tome, which is the total unedited pompousness of the writing style. I'm convinced that the book would be 50 pages shorter just by removing all instances the word ""milieu."" The author loves analogies so much that sometimes she would include an analogy to explain another analogy to explain the main concept, all within the same sentence. This all makes for a redundant, plodding, jaw-grindingly slow read. I'll definitely pick this book up once the author hires an editor to remove the redundant word usage and pare it down to the 250 pages of actual content that can be found between its covers."
251,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/111466671-matteo-guainazzi,4,"With this important, albeit occasionally verbose, essay Shoshana Zuboff leads us though a deep understanding of the most advanced frontiers of modern capitalism. Starting from the discovery that huge profits can be extracted through the illegittimate dispossession of behavioural patterns drawn from our usage of the net, and supported by unprecedented computational facilities, companies such as Google, Facebook and alike have recently embraced the concept of behavioral manipulation to ensure full predictability of our behaviours as customers. With frequent reference to Annah Arendt, Zuboff qualifies the societal view underpinning these developments as a new totalitarism, fundamentally undermining the conceptual fundations of democracy in areas as crucial as the respect of the sanctuary of our homes and of our inner self, the right to the future tense (or, in Sartre's word, ""of the will to will""), to empathy and politics and inter-personal mediation, to mention just a few. Against any ""conspiracy theory"", Zuboff shows that these developments occur openly. This book provides the reader with pleny of food for thoughts, many reasons to despair, and a pale glimpse of hope because resistance - as futile as it may look in a world where hyper-connection has turned into a condition for survival - is still possible."

Shoshana Zuboff is a great thinker. This is a work of genius.it is beautifully written in a classical style that echoes the voices of prominent philosophers of the past.Some who read this may be repulsed and reject it. If the length, density or subject matter make you inclined to pass on this book, I suggest starting with this short interview with Shoshana: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=JggNWSM...I say this not just as someone who shares Shoshana's views on the virtues of democracy and the ills of current day business models, but also someone who has been concerned about her privacy online for over a decade. Even if you are happy with the status quo, you will almost certainly benefit from digesting these ideas and deciding for yourself what you think of them.The only flaw I could find with this book is its complexity, which makes it less likely to be read by non-philosophy majors like myself. In my opinion it would benefit greatly by being dramatized a la Mean Girls (Yes, it should be a comedy! Calling Tina Fey and Amy Pohler), adapted into a children's book, and there should be an abridged trade paperback version.So why did I give this one star? Read to find out :D"
253,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/80112227-sam-mccarthy,4,"This is a very special, albeit flawed, book. Some of Zuboff's theoretical concepts--surveillance capitalism (of course), behavioral surplus, behavioral futures markets, instrumentation power, etc.--are novel, deeply compelling, and imbued with tremendous emotional power. I have no doubt that these ideas will continue to inspire scholars (and hopefully normal people) for years to come. It's clear that this book was written to provide a theoretical framework in which to analyze problems which will only fully materialize in years to come.That brings me to the book's central problem: Zuboff is heavy on theory, which is great, but fails to succinctly and systematically describe, in quantitative as well as quantitive terms, the mechanisms of contemporary surveillance capitalism. She describes its origins at Google, and elaborates how surveillance capitalism might shape human nature in the future, but fails to describe its present--besides many fleeting examples and anecdotes. The book is also quite poorly organized, with many sections that overlap with one another or are placed seemingly at random in the book. This is ultimately a shame, because with better editing (and with 100-200 less pages), The Age of Surveillance Capitalism would be even more of a classic than it is already destined to become."

This is probably due to the relative monoculture that the technological community suffers from and who may be picking this book up. Some on here are saying that the future is all potentials and looking to downplay Big Tech's previous mistakes and misdeeds as it works towards utopia, but anybody who has a vague grasp of how capitalism has always interacted with democracy, ecology, race, gender, class and all sorts of other identities will be aware that without an overhaul of the present system we find ourselves within, we will struggle to build the society we want unless after collapse, if at all. Hoping that gatekeepers bound by profit and growth and with the amount of power that they have already amassed (both financially and with regards to data) will be capable of providing liberation is more than short-sighted, and with the ecological time-bomb we are facing, it is a belief that will hopefully fall away before too long."

In essence, this book is about a new Big Brother, one that doesn't have the face of Uncle Sam and infinitely more menacing than anything our government can put together. This book is about surveillance capitalism and its strangulation of humankind as we know it. We know surveillance capitalism by names like Google, Facebook, Amazon, Apple, etc. All are companies that have mastered the art of surveillance capitalism, essentially ingesting information we willingly and unwillingly provide, package all of our essence into ""products"" and sell them in the marketplace. We become the raw material and in the process lose our humanity. The book goes into terrifying details at how this is happening, and cites numerous examples.I believe this book is a must read for anybody who have an account with Facebook, Google, Apple, or Amazon, or any of the big data-driven companies. It will truly open your eyes and make you have second thought the next time a site prompts you to link your Google or Facebook account. And I believe this book is instrumental for those that want to find ways to improve their digital self-defense and keep safe the few sanctuaries we have left in this digital age."

That said, while well-written, it's certainly not uplifting and it's entertaining only in a ""OMG car crash!"" kind of way. Zuboff is a hard-core academic with well-honed popular essay chops so she is well qualified for this kind of thing. The topic, however, is a grim one. Zuboff gives us a substantial tome that explains how the likes of Facebook and Google (and China) are creating a sinister new chapter for capitalism. In essence, our information behaviours leave behind ""digital exhaust"" that can be mined to determine and drive ""behavioural surplus."" The book provides details overviews of the operations of the tech companies (and China) situated within the context of social criticism and analysis. In addition to Google, we get a kind of grad-school buffet: Marx, Webber, Adorno, Skinner, Goffman, etc. Via her analysis and the use of concepts like enclosure she allows us to understand how Silicon Valley's quest to serve up information (Google search in 1999) is leading directly to being shaped by those same providers (e.g., driving foot traffic to specific places via Pokemon Go). Think of this book up as a mashup of a corporate hagiography, an academic dissertation, and the old Twilight Zone episode ""How to Serve Man."""

Citing Arendt's Origins of Totalitarianism and Skinner's Beyond Freedom and Dignity throughout, she shows how the Googles and Facebooks are undermining freedom and democracy by violating privacy with and without consent, acting above the law and threatening everything we have worked so hard to achieve over the last 300 years.While it is repetitive, most of the points made build to this terrifying conclusion - we are sleepwalking into a new totalitarianism concealed with soft sentiments about connectivity. Readers feel like they are watching the Invasion of the Body Snatchers - while we are sleeping the Zuckerbergs and Pages are stealing our humanity for their own profit and are herding us to a hive mind future. Well its time to wake up and smell the poison.Google is evil, Facebook is too, Amazon is joining in and so is Microsoft. Before it is too late - wake up. Do everything you can to wake others, break up these companies, tax them and remove the surveillance. If not, my friends we are screwed.

For search engines, she prefers to use DuckDuckGo. Zuboff even uses Premium VPN services and TOR networks all the time to disguise her identity on the internet.Why? Because Zuboff is avoiding what is called surveillance capitalism.Zuboff specifically took the example of the internet giant Google as the main patron of the birth and development of surveillance capitalism. This new level of capitalism is different. According to Zuboff, if industrial capitalism grows and makes time labor value surplus as profit accumulation, surveillance capitalism collects what Zuboff calls ""behavioral surplus"". This is our data, habits and behavior on the internet. All of that is a surplus collected by Google and other internet giants, to be traded for profit.Zuboff further argues that surveillance capitalism has the same characteristics as industrial capitalism: it alienates people, makes the gap between the poor and the rich wider, and tries very hard to keep capital spinning.And same as an industrial capitalism, surveillance capitalism is also waiting for its own death. Sooner or later capitalism, in any form, will dig its own grave."

They know your exact location every single minute of the day, they know what you like, what you hate, what you buy, when you buy it, and what you wish to buy in the future. They know your friends. They hear your living room conversations and have a detailed floor plan of your home. In other words, they know about you more than you know about yourself.This knowledge dissymmetry gives them huge power and they use it to make piles of money. But the book warns that such irresponsible power could be used for something more sinister than just profit. They could use it for control. The 2016 election is but a warm up of what targeted misinformation campaigns could do.The book explains why a passive, so what if they know, attitude is similar to that of native Americans receiving Spanish conquerers unaware of the devastation they are bringing upon their ancient civilization.It’s a call to action, an eye opening, well researched, and well written book!"

This book is 1) a call to action, 2) an alarm sounded to the risks that surveillance tech poses to the future of human autonomy and democracy and 3) a beautiful tapestry of psychology, law, and philosophy (here I'll briefly highlight her respective discussions on B.F. Skinner's ""Other One""; Communications Decency Act of 1996; Gaston Bachelard's poetics of space) woven to frame her critique of surveillance capitalism. While I found the language growing excessively academic at times, and the latter 2/3rds of the book a bit repetitive, this remains one of my top reads of the past two years. Nearly every other page of my copy is underlined, dogeared, and/or marked with a (!!) in the margins. A personal note: I purchased this in a South Kensington bookshop while roaming London alone during the New Year, carried it with me through Beijing and northwest China, then finished it ""sheltered-in-place"" in my San Francisco Bay Area home during the COVID-19 pandemic. Filtering the differential implications of Zuboff's theses through these places, societies, and historical times was another astounding, satisfying exercise."

And that's a problem.  In Shoshana Zuboff epic manifesto on what she calls the Age of Surveillance Capitalism, she succinctly explains, illustrates, and projects this new paradigm that threatens our individuality, autonomy, our democracy, our will and ultimately our selves. Data is king, and the scientists and computer demons at Google and Facebook (as well as thousands of other companies) have not only captured the easily and obvious info from our phones, photos, clicks, likes, friends, etc., but now have moved on to rendering our everyday experiences, including our emotional and psychological states into data. And then that data is analysed, turned into powerful algorithms that can predict our behavior for profit. And the more data that is collected (without our permission) the better those predictions and products become. It's truly scary. This book is seminal and I hope like Rachel Carson's ""Silent Spring"" it will be a wake-up call to all of us.   "

In the past, humans have conquered the physical lands that we've stand on, but now, its ever-expanding prevalence has extended that reach into human nature. Zuboff uses the fundamental forces in our modern-day surveillance industry those being Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and Facebook. She connects them as the players in this game of extreme libertarianism that reaches not only capitalism but into the extend of our minds, through exploring how those corporations use their techniques of constant observation and prediction. For the corporations, we are not only the product, but we are the raw material that runs their operations, we feed ourselves to each other in a constant flow of production. This is a book that I will automatically recommend for anyone who wants to understand how bad our current fascist-like system of social media, moves through every facet of our lives. It's got a lot of references in the back for anyone who wishes to look into and develop further one's conclusions. Slightly hard to read for those who don't follow tech or cultural studies. Otherwise, it's a really clear and concise read. "

And one potential consequence of this business model being taken too far is that they have gone from automating behavioural measurement, to automating behaviours. Ideas like democracy and free will suddenly appear to be in danger. Additionally, this book ironically provides a pretty compelling picture of the gigantic business moat that such companies possess, and why governments might actually be incentivised to play down the value of individual privacy in support of privacy erosion and societal stability, and thus buck against any popular push to break up these tech giants. The world painted by Aldous Huxley in Brave New World remains quite plausible."

It's well-researched and confirms a lot of fears I had about the tech industry. I appreciated the lines quoting tech execs that read like they are sourced from a James Bond villain. Zuboff is 100% correct in the sentiment that you need to name and shame what is happening right and how using old labels like Totalitarianism or old defences like Anti-Trust laws just doesn't work against the unprecedented. I applaud her work in creating a new vocabulary conceptualizing Surveillance Capitalism.However, it was a tough read and at times it felt as if it was repeating itself. I also have to mention the prose, which at times works really well to describe a concept but largely it serves as confusing filler. Also, since it covers a lot of ground from the history of Big Tech to behaviourism to social media's impact on teens, some ideas feel very disconnected to others. Regardless the ideas are excellent ideas individually and truthfully I think the book would have been better as a number of separate essays. Certainly hope to read more about Surveillance Capitalism in the future, and maybe even write some of it myself."

But the book - the main ideas of which you could quickly perceive by watching a Youtube video, such as this one https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIXhn... - is way too long for the average reader. Alas, the average reader is the one would stand to gain most by reading it. The average reader is not some Harvard academic like Ms Shoshana Zuboff, but the one sought after by the very ""fishers of people"" (i.e., the likes of Google, Facebook, Microsoft and Amazon). The average reader will likely lose interest midway through this - otherwise, exquisite, passionate, well researched - book."

There's something serious to be written on this subject, but this is mostly extrapolation from intent, rather than empirical reportage of affect. The book claims power by asserting quite histrionic naming of the phenomena that it describes, and repeats itself endlessly. It's a shame, because it's a serious and intelligent discursion that is clearly entered into earnestly. But we really need to know less about what Eric Schmidt might have said and more the corrupting effect on those less powerful. The omissions here, such as a lack of description of the way the alt-right has managed to take advantage of YouTube's algorithms, are significant. It's unclear, also, what the writer would have us do differently. I didn't come away from the book feeling as if I'd really learned anything, or wished to pursue any of the ideas discussed any further."

Probably, part of my liking this book is that ""I was there,"" and I am aware of most of the facts. The difference is that I am not particularly alarmed with the perspective. I was always thinking, as long as I can remember thinking about it, that in the hypothetical future, it will be an established fact that anybody can locate anybody in the world, and I do not consider it wrong. Yes, any technology can be used for good and for evil, but this applies to ANY technology. Same with influencing people's decisions. Hitler didn't have the Internet. He didn't even have television. Yet, he was able to influence millions, and they honestly believed it was their own decision, their personal choice. It has been happening through the course of history all the time. That's what debates were for. That's what political speeches were for. You are trying to influence people, and if you are skilled enough, you can. "

Though she presents many aspects in rather alarmist or catastrophic tone, which many readers might consider to be over board, I think that these tones are not necessarily misplaced as society's transformation into a hyper connected world that is on the march towards singularity will for sure entail the radical transformation of life and our social relationships. However, the decay of one way of being does not need to entail a negative development. Sadly Shoshana does seem to articulate a bit to much the negative aspects of where this is leading. However, here once again I would not condemn this over accentuation. But, I would look into all the pit falls that she presented, into all the distopic possibilities that await us if we make the wrong move as extra motivation to force us to ensure that we will take extra care as we build and implement these new technologies that will reshape humanity.

I'm rethinking everything from how I do business, bank, buy groceries, unlock my front door (with my smart lock app), use my security system, to where I ""check-in"", what I buy online, and even what I say/post on social media. Yes, I was aware of a good bit of what was going on but I wasn't ready to journey so far into the weeds. Living off grid in a sailboat is looking pretty good about now. While this all sounds dire, I think this book is an important read. A wake up call for all of us. We need to be shaken violently to realize we have become commodities in this new economy. For a long time, I've believed our economic models are so outdated and yet we continue to try to use them to define and understand our current world. This book brilliantly tackles the new economy with new models and structures. It's exactly what I was asking for... and you know how the saying goes.

I wrote a review for it right after I read it and copy pasted it here.This thing is an absolute doorstopper. Plus, it's not exactly easy reading. These things have combined to make it take awhile to read.It's kind of scary. Like, I'm one of those people somewhat prone to going into the whole humans suck and we're so prone to manipulation free will is just something we like to tell ourselves but we are doomed blah blah blah edgelady stuff and I was still taken aback by the extent of a lot of this. I really do like how Zuboff repeatedly emphasizes that this is not inevitable or mandatory, however. The whole deal of ultra targeted ads being used to warp spending, voting, and even wider beliefs being necessary for modern life is basically just an excuse companies make to maximize profits and there are legit alternatives out there. I kind of doubt that the necessary changes needed to stop them are going to happen any time soon, though."

Zuboff has clearly done her research, but she too can clearly not let go off the parts that are irrelevant in telling her story. It is at least twice as long as it needs to be and she spends most of the book developing her own idiolect around Surveillance Capitalism that too plainly aims to become the future glossary of terms for the topic...indeed it may well eventually happen, but it comes across at this stage as unnatural, jarring and desperate. There is no more important book about the reduction of privacy and personal liberal that the digital age is bringing about, but this book fails to sell the point because the point is overly stretched. I’m glad I powered through between the very interesting first 1/4 to the vital final 1/4 but everything in between is vanity based on her inability to let things go in the writing process. 3/5 because of its overall importance: an abridged version would benefit from wider reading."

It's likely to be the most relevant thing you read this or most other years. And it's likely to perform a paradigm shift in the way you think about the way we use the Internet and digital communication tools. Which is to say, it'll a perform a paradigm shift in the way you think about your everyday life. Zuboff isn't some fringe radical. She's even pro capitalism (one of the my takeaways from this book is that it's better to talk of 'capitalisms' than capitalism). Her appraisal of the digital and thoroughly surveilled order of things that's shot up around us might seem grim to some, and her critique of the surveillance capitalists of Silicon Valley scathing (though there's little in Zuckerberg, Sandberg, Google, and co.'s behaviour to seriously contradict her assessments). But Zuboff brings a thoroughness to her research and argumentation that makes this an amazing primer on the subject, even if you don't share her pessimism."

The book was also frequently redundant, yet the writer's deft wordsmithery kept me doggedly turning each page (kinda like how Big Other seeks to make its enslavement of you a pleasure). The upshot: I want everyone to read this book, yet the most efficient way to convey this message is by posting this message online and therefore enlarging my digital footprint, wading deeper into my new role (indeed, the new role of every person on the globe) as a hapless sucker on the wrong side of a one-way mirror. Totally absorbing, convincing and terrifying. Read a few pages at a time -- as much as you can stand at one sitting -- then go take a nice relaxing bath or enjoy a peaceful walk in the woods. On the other hand, maybe not. They're watching you there too."

Should have been about half the length as it was incredibly repetitive. I did stick it out to the end, though, which is worth at least half a star! Its biggest impact on me was the larger perspective, putting the period we're living through in the historical context of earlier periods of colonial expansion and the industrial revolution. It's hard to argue with the observation that the presumption of rights by people with power is a fundamental mechanism to the preservation of that power, and with the argument that we've seen a lot of that presumption in the Internet era. The fact that the historical precedents suggest it takes in the order of decades, if not centuries, for power at this scale to be checked by balancing mechanisms (e.g. human rights, labour laws, environmental protection in the case of the industrial revolution) is pretty sobering."

It will take me months to digest but the most immediate idea I take away is how all sorts of things like insurance of all kinds, travel and medical monitoring will compel us to allow our data to be taken, in the same way that opting in to social media and finding information on the internet already do, on pain of termination of service. It's a very big book although looks even bigger as there are 160 pages of notes and such, in addition to the 525 pages of text. I'm quite comforted that I was forced to keep going and finish it at speed as there were two other library readers waiting for it - I wish them luck. The writing was very academic (I think) and it took me a long time to get started and get comfortable with the prose. And there was a lot I didn't understand.... for example page 505 'Now the hive emulates the ""termite state"".....' Does anyone know?"

It’s not really anything against the author in particular, but more on how modern books are written. I feel as if authors have ventured further away from stating a case in a concise and coherent manner, and instead they tend to use convoluted esoteric jargon that the layperson cannot understand. From what I can tell the only motive for doing such a thing would be to put on a facade of intellect, but what do I know. In my opinion there is an extraordinary eloquence to concision through text and I wish others shared that view instead of romanticizing everything with incoherent babbling. This turned into more of a rant instead of a review so I’m just gonna leave it at that and bounce. "

I saw this review linked and agree with most of it: https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/t.... I don't completely agree, however, with the reviewer's point that Zuboff's argument would be stronger if she had addressed why the public has agreed to the terms of surveillance capitalism, knowing the costs involved. Zuboff's point is that not only does the public generally NOT know (and I agree), but that FB/Google are deliberately deceptive about this trade-off, and that the centrality of such surveillance to their business strategy means they will not change on their own. The point is that the costs are hidden, and when they become more clear (Cambridge Analytica was only a taste of things to come, I suspect), Zuboff suggests that it will be too late, as if it isn't already.

Even now, I'm still not sure how to rank it. Did this book terrify me? Yes. Was that terror necessary? Perhaps not. Did it help to guide my thinking for a gigantic range of topics? Yes. For the average reader, this book is overwritten with some ideas that I think would be impenetrable for non academics. What's more, some of Zuboff's points have been argued elsewhere in a more concise manner. Even with all of those caveats, I'm glad that I made it to the end. It was worth it for me, but I'm not sure it will be for others.I read this as part of a faculty book club, and I hope I'll change my mind on some of these topics once I talk to colleagues from other disciplines. If you don't have the time to wade through this lengthy book, I recommend her Op-Ed from January, 2020. "

A thermostat, TV, doorbell, vacuum cleaner (ahem, Roomba), toothbrush, speaker (err…Alexa), a PHONE? If so, you owe it to yourself to give this a read or listen. Zuboff lays out the argument that we are in a transition to a new sort of economy, “The Third Modernity”, and with that has come this new form of capitalism - Surveillance Capitalism. This book serves to create an understanding of this new type of capitalism, how we got to where we are, and exactly how invasive this surveillance has become.She focuses mainly on Google and Facebook as they best exemplify a pure form of Surveillance Capitalism as she argues it. I found it very interesting, and enlightening. Other than Zuboff using the word “milieu” so many times that it seems she may have just learned it or misplaced her thesaurus, this book is a must read for anyone that uses the internet."

It serves as a stark warning of a future in which every aspect of our lives is rendered digitally to “personalize” our experiences, even before we know we may want something. The author meticulously describes the conditions that gave rise to Google, Facebook and their ilk, how they operate and flourish. Her quotes from their executives justifying their actions and the sheer hubris is breath taking. The weaving of surveillance capitalism into the history of capitalism, human society and notions of freedom is well done. The author’s prose gets overly dramatic and verbose at times, but the writing remains cogent. One flaw is the limited acknowledgement of the benefits and utility to users and society that Internet companies provide. That point aside, I highly recommend this book. It’s not an easy read, but well worth it. "

There are very serious issues about user data protection and the misuse of personal information that are skimmed over in the book to dwell on a behavior modification and mind control hypothesis.There is a serious problem with a lack of regulation in the use of personal information by technology firms in seeking user data as a product when the user is not even aware of how much and what information is collected. A serious problem as well in the use of data mining of personal information to ensure addiction to a continuous stream of content over hours on social media platforms. Analysis of those issues are left incomplete in an obsession to promote a conspiracy of technology firms setting up an authoritarian regime known as surveillance capitalism.

The one against a form of society where all that makes us belongs to some others, who, thanks to ubiquitous surveillance, know us even better than we do.The book details how, under the guise of making our lives easier, our most intimate parameters are being harvested, stored, and processed by machine learning. No one in history has had that amount of proprietary data available, ever.Our behaviours are being studied, but even worse, modified. We have already seen how whole elections were manipulated to obtain desired outcomes, which, incidentally, were always towards leaders who would tale society away from democracy.Surveillance capitalism is about the expropriation of free will. Although, when one reads about how easy it is to steer it, one may wonder if it even exists."
284,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/101869397-paddy,4,Very disturbing book. The parallels with how fascism and totalitarianism emerged in the 20th century are meant to draw attention to how they insidiously crept up on society just as surveillance capitalism has. The ruthless harvesting of personal data by the big tech firms is well known. The book was published before Google’s troubles with the Federal anti-trust investigations became public. What protects us today is that govt is not in collusion with big tech unlike in China where society has been effectively subjugated by state sponsored surveillance. The book is scholarly but tedious reading in parts. The core message comes through in the first hundred pages. After that it’s a lot of supporting arguments for the main thesis. One thing for sure is that this book will change your relationship with social media platforms and ubiquitous computing devices.

I listened to a couple of podcasts where the author appeared as a guest and found the topic to be quite interesting.The book overall, was extremely well researched with incredible amount of details. The author covered all grounds on the topic and the content was very interesting and eye-opening. The issues I had however, is that each sentences in the book is overly complicated for no particular reason. I initially started to read the physical copy of the book but quickly found myself confused as it was very difficult to interpret. I switched to the audiobook version but I still had trouble understanding some of the contents. Also some elements are overly repetitive as well. Content wise 5/5 but writing style is 3.5/5. Overall highly recommended. "

It was recommended to me by a fascinating, Harvard-educated scholar over dinner in India. The way he talked about the book made it sound both gripping and insightful. And I can see why, to somebody already steeped in the academic writing style of the humanities, it would be. But for the average reader, I think the points are overly convoluted, the sentences too rambling and stuffed with unnecessary expositions and references, and the subject matter a bit trite. Maybe I was not the target demographic, maybe I am just too lazy in my reading to want to trudge through run-on sentence after run-on sentence, but overall I just wasn't sold on the book. Putting it down for the last time was a relief and it lifted a weight off my back, allowing me to dive into other books that I have devoured at my regular pace."

First, it gives an in-depth accumulated telling of how large internet/tech companies have invaded more and more of individual's privacy over the years. Second, it gives philosophical and political background and interpretations of those company's effect on society. Third, it compares Surveillance Capitalism (these large tech companies taking our privacy away, and using our data for their own profit, creating anti-democratic societal forces) with Industrial Capitalism. As Industrial Capitalism changed the planet by going all-in on fossil fuels and absolute devotion to growth, Surveillance Capitalism is changing society by going all-in on taking individuals' privacy, negatively effecting individuals' liberties, and creating an oligarchic technocracy.It is a chilling book.

Zuboff charts painstakingly how private firms- Google and Facebook leading the way- collect customers private data, turn it into a means of predicting what those people will buy and hope to eventually replace people's ideas with their own. All for the purpose of ensuring huge profits. She thinks the end of individualism and democracy are at hand if something isn't done to stop corporations misusing private information. Chapters on the effect Facebook has on the lives of adolescents and the introduction of sensors placed in products such as clothes make eyeopening reading. Zuboff deserves credit for writing this penetrating study even if I don't agree with all of her assertions. At 525 pages she's a bit prolix as well. "
289,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/97987293-ethan,5,"A widely popular truism states knowledge is power, and the big five tech companies (Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Amazon, and Apple) currently have access to a level of knowledge unprecedented in all human history. Despite this, an amazing number of people seem totally unconcerned about the overwhelming amount of data these companies about them and how it is used. A large part of this indifference can be attributed to ignorance, as tech companies do everything in their power to obfuscate their insidious data collection methods. In this brilliantly incisive and seminal criticism of surveillance capitalism, Shoshana Zuboff synthesizes a wide array of market and social conditions that led to its creation, chronicles its explosive rise throughout the 21st century, and analyzes the implications it has on both democracy and the human experience. Surveillance capitalism, Zuboff begins, was born in the early days of Google when they discovered data exhaust leftover in the wake of search queries contained valuable behavioral surplus. Invigorated and empowered by this discovery, Google began to employ increasingly aggressive methods to target and extract behavioral surplus data to fuel their prediction services. These prediction services, for which the author coins the term “behavioral market futures,” emerged for advertisers to target their products to Google users, but as Zuboff keenly acknowledges, there is no reason why such markets are limited to this group. In fact, many of the major players that now continuously demand the intensification of surveillance capitalism’s production capabilities are governments, calling it the ultimate solution to societal uncertainty and the “war on terror.”As the behavioral futures market grows, so too does the economic imperative for extraction of behavioral surplus data. And if prediction services are the product, Zuboff reckons human nature is the source of raw material being mined by extraction algorithms. By commodifying the prediction of our future behavior, the aim of surveillance capitalists is the automation of society through tuning, herding, and conditioning people to produce preselected behaviors judged as desirable by state or market actors to achieve guaranteed outcomes. The book goes on to elaborate the different purposes for which market and state actors wield surveillance tools, which defines the difference between totalitarianism and what Zuboff calls instrumentarianism. In the US, surveillance capitalism is characterized by instrumentarianism because the overt forces are predominantly market actors trying to achieve guaranteed market outcomes. In China, the Communist People’s Party, having developed an objectionable but comprehensive social credit system, is totalitarian because they are a state actor trying to achieve guaranteed social outcomes. The Chinese government appears to recognize the enormous power that accrues to the owners of the means of behavior modification, as Zuboff writes, “In 2017 the central bank retracted its support for the private-sector personal credit programs, perhaps because they were too successful, their concentrations of knowledge and power too great. Sesame Credit had acquired more than 400 million users in just two years, staking a claim to just about every aspect of those users’ lives. A journalist who wrote a book on Ant Financial anticipates that the government is preparing to assert control over the whole system: ‘The government doesn’t want this very important infrastructure of the people’s credit in one big company’s hands.’” Another casualty of surveillance capitalism is social trust, which Zuboff notes has fallen precipitously, both on an interpersonal level and toward legitimate authority, as machines are substituted for social relations. Along these lines, she laments the decline of private sanctuaries in which one feels safe and free to be their true self. People, particularly the young, now censor and curate their conduct in consideration of their own online networks as well as the larger prospect of the internet masses. She cites researchers who conclude that participation in social media “is profoundly intertwined with the knowledge that information about our offline activities may be communicated online, and the thought of displeasing ‘imagined audiences’ alters our ‘real-life’ behavior.’”  Finally, Zuboff draws parallels between the modus operandi of big tech and the work of BF Skinner. She lambastes the objectification of the human experience by rendering it as behavioral data, and opines that the trouble with modern behaviorism is not that it’s wrong but that it may become true. The trend of information processing increasingly being used as an essential element of long term strategies of manipulation for individual conduct threatens not just the market, but also the foundation of democracy, which depends upon a reservoir of individual capabilities associated with autonomous moral judgment and self-determination. She quotes neoliberal economist Friedrich Hayek’s critique that Adam Smith’s Invisible Hand might perhaps better be described as an invisible pattern, and warns that big tech is breaking this pattern by marching ever closer to total knowledge. She argues that as citizens, a society, and a civilization, we must acknowledge that surveillance capitalists know too much to qualify for the freedom they seek, and the real psychological truth is that if you’ve “got nothing to hide,” you are nothing.In sum, though long, challenging, and at times repetitive, this book is a masterful, urgent, and crucial inspection into the existential threat surveillance capitalism poses to democracy, freedom, and arguably even the basis of free will as many understand it. Not only should you read it immediately, you should also urge your friends to do the same."

This repeated so often and out of our knowledge, as the experience is repeated so often that we become numb, forgetting that it’s not some dystopian imagining of the future, it’s present. “ while insisting their technology is too complex to be legislated, companies spend billions of lobbying against oversight, and while building empires on publicly funded data and details of our private lives they have repeatedly rejected established norms of societal responsibility and accountability.” What crucially different about this form is that they stripping our intimate lives but seek to shape, direct and control it."

As someone already inclined toward detaching from social media, I do think the text is hyperbolized but partially because that's the point. I expect this from the book's title. What makes the hyperbole frustrating at times is its repetitiveness. If the book were trimmed by 150-200 pages, it would be stellar. I feel like the author repeats herself in the beginning and final 25% of each chapter -- just reworded in an unnecessarily dense way. However, Zuboff really shines in part 3 of the book. After part 2 I expected more filler on the mechanisms at work, but she instead describes how society might look if surveillance capitalism perpetuates uncontrollably. Initially I found the comparisons to twentieth century totalitarianism a bit... insensitive. But Zuboff's chilling arguments are neither entirely far-fetched nor forgettable."

It shows how they're driven by a need to collect more and more 'behavioral surplus' data, to turn into knowledge that can be used to target ads and influence the behavior of whole populations for profit. It shows how they apply deliberate strategies to reach this goal, aimed at keeping the extent of the data they collect secret and taking away decision power from the individual. When looking at the actions of these companies in this light, they suddenly start making sense.Unfortunately, the important message of this book drowns in the overcomplicated and abstract writing style used. On top of that, the book is two to three times as long as it needs to be. I recommend everyone to learn about this topic, but maybe try to find a better source to do so from."

Still, the author’s arguments are strong, well-supported, and frighteningly real, from my perspective. I am grateful that she’s giving language to this technological (robotic?) shift in human culture and society, and with such dramatic poetry!

I can’t really get over the positive references to Marx either - that guy’s views have been proven wrong in the Soviet (where I grew up), Venezuela and a few others.

What annoys me is that I carried on trying to read this book, hoping that I could get through it because of the subject, to the point where I thought my vocab was just horrible and I'm just not an experienced reader.
