0,1430300612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/220791-lena,3,"Jill Bolte Tayor was a 37-year old neuroanatomist when she experienced a massive stroke that severely damaged the left hemisphere of her brain. My Stroke of Insight is her account of what happened that day, her subsequent 8-year recovery, and how these events changed her life for the better.The most interesting part of the book for me was Bolte Taylor’s discussion of what happened to her on that morning in 1996. With her scientific background, Bolte Taylor was in a unique position to observe the progressive breakdown of her own functioning as the blood from her burst AVM spread throughout her brain. As new areas were affected, different functions were lost, and reading about her experience is a strange kind of real-world brain anatomy lesson.A significant portion of this book is devoted to the process of Bolte Taylor’s recovery. She realized early on that the attitude and pacing of her caregivers made a big difference in how willing and able she was to respond, and she speaks in detail about what she, personally, found was most effective in helping her heal. There is some useful information in this section for those involved in stroke victim care.What has catapulted this book onto the bestseller list, however, is the spiritual message underlying Bolte Taylor’s experience. When the language processing areas of her brain shut down, Bolte Taylor found herself bathed in a kind of peace and bliss that was previously unknown to her. With the section of her brain that controls physical boundaries offline, she felt fluid, open, and one with everything around her.Bolte Taylor considers these experiences to be the result of her right brain suddenly being given the chance to run the show while her left brain was incapacitated. She speaks quite a bit about how she made a conscious decision during her recovery to retain access to these states and to keep these pathways open as she brought her left brain back online. In the latter section of the book, she offers a list of techniques she feels anyone can use to help open up pathways to the expanded capacities of their own right brains.I learned a number of interesting things while reading this book, and there is no question that Bolte Taylor’s story is a very inspiring one. Ultimately, however, I was disappointed by a number of things about this book. To start, it would have benefited from better editing. Some sections are highly repetitive, I was confused about certain aspects of her level of functioning and recovery, and the flow of the narrative was very uneven. Hers is a great story, and good editing would have made that even more obvious.My main criticism of this book, however there is a very sloppy blending of hard, scientific information about the brain with Bolte Taylor’s anecdotal experience and personal theories about what happened to her. It was not always obvious which was which, and I suspect many readers will be confused and assume her personal theories are more scientifically grounded than they actually are. Though Bolte Taylor does not specifically mention religion in the book, her numerous allusions to prayer, visualization, energy, and oneness make it clear that she subscribes to a certain kind of belief system that her experiences are filtered through. While this is to be expected, her inability to see the contradictions in her beliefs was frustrating to me. For example, she speaks about how, after the stroke, she floated in a place of bliss, at one with everything. Yet just a few paragraphs earlier, she refers to a harried, inexperienced medical student as an “energy vampire.” She does not address why her feelings of being at one with and connected to everything did not extend to this person. In addition, she is critical of how the judgmental function of the left brain keeps us shut down from the more expanded perspective of the right brain, yet doesn’t seem to notice her own preference for right-brain dominated experiences seems, well, kind of judgmental.I’ve had personal experiences of peace and bliss that are similar to what Bolte Taylor describes, so I can certainly understand her preference for them. I also think she gives some good advice to help people find those states themselves without having to have a stroke to get there. But I think this book would have been much more valuable had Bolte Taylor used her scientifically trained left-brain to more clearly separate her anecdotal experience and beliefs what science actually tells us about our fascinating brains. "
1,1430300612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/219670-janet,2,"I closed this book today with such a sense of relief. This is, in essence, a self help book marked by the author's inflated (with due reason, I know) sense of self and a few interesting tidbits about brain chemistry.Let's get a few things straight:1. I love reading about the brain.2. I was really, really wanting to love this book.3. I, like the author, believe that--in most cases--happiness and peacefulness can be choices for every person and that our brain can become wired to react more positively to the world.What I didn't like was the author's tone/attitude, her need to italicize the word ""one"" whenever she used it (as in, ""I was _one_ with the universe,"" a sentiment repeated seventy-six times each chapter), and the way she skimmed over information about the brain as if she were approaching third graders. Maybe I'll have more to stay about this book once I have a book club meeting about it in a couple of weeks. Or else I'll just put it out of my head forever and sell my copy online.Here's what I wrote a few days ago:I'm halfway through and the woman is driving me batty. Batty, I say...I hope to change my mind, especially since I brought this up as a book club suggestion and now at least five other people are reading it because of me!"

She takes the reader through the events of her stroke and the recovery. (8 long years of recovery!) She gives basic brain science for understanding, and speaks from the heart.

But it was too late. I was suckered in. And really, if those cards help her start her day with a clear intention, and bring her comfort and peace, more power to her. Maybe more of us need to do that.Or not.Anyway, this book gets 5 stars alone for Appendix B in the back.

3,1430300612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/597461-elyse-walters,5,I read this years ago --- still own it. I thought the insights were amazing --and a fascinating story. --Emotional too....This was a woman's 'life'.Interesting how books pop into our space when we are meeting new friends on Goodreads....Brings back memories of books we read! A treasure in itself! -- make a new friend = re-visit books we have read.............nice deal!
4,1430300612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/162265-natalie,2,"I wanted to like this book more than I actually did. I wanted this book to be several other books than the one it actually was. I found it alternately fascinating and incredibly irritating. Taylor is a brain scientist who had a stroke and recovered enough to write about it. The chance to learn about what that experience was like seemed compelling enough to me to start reading the book. When her left brain went offline due to the stroke, she experienced only living in her right brain --what she describes as a blissful nirvana. She's spent years getting her left brain back, and as a result has a unique perspective on the relationship of the two halves.I stuck with the book because I'm sympathetic to at much of what she was saying -- that if you can turn down the volume on the ego's chatter to attain a sense of calm, your life is better off. It's just that most of us approach that goal through meditation, yoga, spiritual practice, or philosophy. Her writing resolutely avoids any such discussion. So it was kind of like reading a book about God written by an autistic person -- it seemed incredibly flat, devoid of emotion, even when she was talking about feelings. I suspect that this book is the result of divided intentions about its goals and audience -- perhaps between the author and her editor, or between the author's two brain halves, I don't know. It's one part pop-science, 1 part survival memoir, 1 part oddly cold narcissism, and 1 part new age metaphysics. The audiences for these things are really different, and to successfully blend them would take a much more compelling writing style than Taylor's. It's unfortunate that a book that should be the demonstration of her recovery kept making me wonder whether she was expressing herself so badly because of her brain injury.There are grains of interesting stuff in here, and it's a quick read. It's definitely been on my mind for the past few days, despite my irritation with it. I've heard from friends that audio interviews with Taylor are very warm and charming, which is the exact opposite of my impression from reading the book. Maybe that would be a better place to start if you're curious."
5,1430300612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/77925-cat,1,"whoa. i probably should have paid more attention to the little tagline under her name that proudly proclaims ""the singin' scientist"" and put it down immediately. but that wasn't how it worked.see, the author is a brain scientist who had a stroke. i heard her speak on NPR and she was insightful and funny and had very interesting things to say about the brain, so i put the book on hold at the library and a eagerly picked it up a few days ago. i loved the section of the book that gave us an intro course on the science of the brain. it was well written and engaging. AND it totally fooled me into thinking that the rest of the book would be more of the same.not so. i felt invested after reading the first 30 or so pages of brain science and then her minute by minute description of what was happening when she suffered a stroke, which is the only somewhat logical reason that i didn't actually throw this book across the room. it was her sappy, polyanna, and ridiculously one-dimensional tale of recovery that made me actually hate this book. her insanely upbeat self-narrative was too much for me. in the words of another reviewer on this site ""The information in this book could have been stopped at phamplet size. Instead we have to read chapter after chapter of 4th grade happy talk.""yep. only now YOU know, so you don't have to."
6,1430300612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5513893-marlan,2,"I'm a neurologist, so I approached this book from a different angle than most readers, I imagine.In short, it was not what I expected. Although she was a neuroanatomist prior to the stroke, the book is not science-y at all. That is both good and bad.The good:A first-hand account of being afflicted by a brain bleed (with aphasia, or inability to produce language, and other losses of function) is priceless. In medicine, we have a great deal to learn from knowing what our patients are going through. She describes her route fantastically well, including her frustrations with the medical field. Her insights into how she feels, and what functions she lost (and gained!) from her stroke are excellent.The bad:Unfortunately, intertwined with her narrative is an explanation of how the brain works that is suspect, to be sure. She compartmentalizes ""right brain, left brain"" in a way that isn't accurate. She teaches a ""this is what I felt, so this is what must be true"" kind of doctrine, which is the kind of thing that can be incredibly misleading. She gets very metaphysical, and to me it seems like she takes her internal sensations as facts. Granted, she attests to not being particularly scientific anymore after her stroke, and this shines through.All in all, I'd like to hear accounts of other left-brain stroke survivors, to see if they had similar experiences to her. I am curious whether all would have similarly nirvana-like, extrasensory perseptory, left-brain-is-evil ideas and experiences."
7,1430300612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1575042-antonia,2,"Oh, gag. Yes, really. I'm glad the author used her stroke to find nirvana, but honestly, stroke just ain't this pretty.The first half of this book, more or less, was a page turner and I was fascinated. Dr. Taylor was a successful 37-year-old neuroanatomist who suffered a hemorrhagic stroke as a result of a congenital condition called arteriovenous malformation (AVM). Partly because of her training and knowledge and partly, I suspect, because of the way the stroke's effects developed and progressed, she was able to observe herself and analyze the process as it was happening (and somehow remembered or recovered this information later -- which seems to me the amazing part (perhaps a little too amazing?). She was functioning enough (barely) to be able to call for help when she realized she was having a stroke. I would guess this is highly atypical. The book is about the events of that day, as well as Dr. Taylor's slow recovery with her damaged brain. I particularly liked the earlier chapters and Taylor's recounting of what she experienced when the stroke occurred (she was alone in her apartment) and the immediate aftermath, the progressive loss of function. There's also a great deal of valuable information about recognizing signs of a stroke, as well as how to treat people who have sustained a stroke. (Patience, patience, patience. And don't holler. They're not deaf.) The book also teaches us about the brain's plasticity and resilience.I felt the book got a bit redundant after a while, but it's hard to fault the author for wanting to underscore her points. She's not just a memoirist. She's a teacher and advocate for people with mental impairment. But after the first few chapters, Taylor wanders off into the la-la land of pseudoscience, pop psych mythology, personal opinion, and belief. Another Goodreads reviewer (Lena) has said: ""[T]here is a very sloppy blending of hard, scientific information about the brain with Bolte Taylor’s anecdotal experience and personal theories about what happened to her. It was not always obvious which was which, and I suspect many readers will be confused and assume her personal theories are more scientifically grounded than they actually are."" I concur and find this irresponsible and troubling. Unfortunately, this led me to have more and more doubts about the veracity of the story she recounted in the early chapters. (How much is accurate, how much a plausible reconstruction? And really, how plausible is it?) Her pop-psych perspective isn't informed by science. Her views on right brain / left brain function are vastly oversimplified and just not consistent with contemporary cognitive neuroscience. I expected more from a PhD neuroanatomist! But perhaps she hasn't kept up with the field since her 1996 stroke.*Of course, some specific functions are lateralized. Most notably, the right hemisphere of the brain controls the left side of the body and vice versa. Linear thinking, logic, language, and math skills are primarily grounded in the left hemisphere. Broca's area (language production) and Wernicke's area (language comprehension) are in the left hemisphere. But many language processes take place in the right hemisphere, along with visual, spatial, and auditory functions. Many other cognitive functions are bilateral. However, the notion that a person is right-brained or left-brained (or that one's personality is right-brain or left-brain dominant) is largely a pop psych myth that derives from research in the 1960s on split-brain patients (people whose corpus collosum connecting the two sides of the brain had been severed). The conclusions of this research were later found to be premature. The two sides of the brain are far more interdependent than once thought. There's a lot of good science and high-tech brain imaging to support this. All complex cognitive function and information processing require complex interactions of various regions of the brain in both hemispheres. This has been well known for over a decade now.The only left-brained or right-brained people are those who've had one of their brain hemispheres removed. By the last few chapters, I felt as though Taylor were just making stuff up. It's a lot of New Age blathering -- a mishmash of personal opinion and belief based on memory and subjective experience, which we well know to be poor indices of objective reality. Most, or certainly many, people who have strokes end up with physical and mental disabilities that are not so easily overcome. And I'm not saying Taylor had an easy time of it, but she does romanticize the whole process which culminates in her ability to be ""one"" with the universe. If she tells us once, she tells us a hundred times.Where did I throw the book across the room?** Maybe when she started talking about how she uses angel cards every day. Or no, maybe here:""I unconditionally love my cells with an open heart and grateful mind. Spontaneously throughout the day, I acknowledge their existence and enthusiastically cheer them on. I am a wonderful living being capable of beaming my energy into the world, only because of them. When my bowels move, I cheer my cells for cleaning that waste out of my body. When my urine flows, I admire the volume my bladder cells are capable of storing. . . .""No Oliver Sacks.Quick, quick! I need an antidote!___________________________________* The modern understanding of brain hemisphere function is not exactly new. In 1999, John McCrone wrote in New Scientist""Many a myth has grown up around the brain's asymmetry. The left cerebral hemisphere is supposed to be the coldly logical, verbal and dominant half of the brain, while the right developed a reputation as the imaginative side, emotional, spatially aware but suppressed. Two personalities in one head, Yin and Yang, hero and villain. To most neuroscientists, of course, these notions are seen as simplistic at best and nonsense at worst.""**Not really. I'd have thrown it had it not been a library book. "
8,1430300612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1073241-cindy,2,"This book wasn't what I was expecting. I expected to read a memoir of sorts. Maybe a before and after or even a during the process what was happening. And JBT does write ""lightly"" about those things. But mainly she is writing a self-help book that seeks to influence the rest of us to embrace the right side of our brains. As a brain scientist, she has a stroke then discovers she is one with the universe. Her brain and her cells are beautiful! Oh how lovely the world and everyone in it! The information in this book could have been stopped at phamplet size. Instead we have to read chapter after chapter of 4th grade happy talk. I can imagine most people aren't as masochistic as I and will quit mid-book on this one . . . "
9,1430300612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3498889-cheryl,5,"5 stars means, to me, that everybody should read it, not that it's necessarily a perfect book.Everybody is fairly likely to have a stroke, watch someone who is having a stroke, know someone who is recovering from a stroke, or at least visit a rehabilitation clinic or nursing home. The recommendations at the end are important. First there's a page that reminds you what a stroke feels like, and tells you to get help immediately.* Then there's a list of advice on how to help someone who is in therapy to recover.*Dr. Jill did not get help immediately, and by the time she realized she needed help, she was almost incapable of calling for same, which further delayed her treatment.Ok, here's the thing. The narrative is only 177 pages, yet I put in 8 bookdarts. Let's see how many I have the energy to share with you. But first, let me tell you more about what's so valuable about this book. It's not just about strokes, or even just about general brain injuries.For example, you know how there's a bunch of current pop psychology books about how train our brains and how to break bad habits and develop good habits? Dr. Jill, while talking about how she worked toward recovery, gives us a really good, really short, version of the content of those books. Another example: there's the 'insight' Dr. Jill experienced. It's a little bit spiritual, a tiny bit 'new-agey.' But it also makes sense to this atheist.Ok, anyway, on to the bookdarts:""I think it is vitally important that stroke survivors share and communicate about how each of their brains strategized recovery.... [O]ur medical professionals could be more effective during those initial hours of treatment and assessment. I wanted my doctors to focus on how my brain was working rather than on whether it worked according to their criteria or timetable. I still knew volumes of information and I was simply going to have to figure out how to access it again.""At home, Jill's mother, G.G., was an amazing therapist. Since much information was lost, G.G. worked to fill in the gaps.""'For lunch, you can have minestrone soup [and I found the file in mind and remembered what that was] or a grilled cheese sandwich [found it] or tuna salad.' Since I could not find the file for tuna salad, that's what we chose for lunch. That was our strategy if I couldn't find the old file; we made it a point to make a new one.""G.G. also guided Jill by giving her toddlers' toys. A 12 piece jigsaw puzzle enabled two days of teachable moments. Jill learned 'face-up' and 'edge' and 'insies & outsies' but was still not making matches, until G.G. noted, ""Jill, you can use color as a clue."" ""I could not see color until I was told that color was a tool I could use. Who would have guessed that my left hemisphere needed to be told about color for it to register? I found the same to be true for seeing in three dimensions.""... Point of clarification: do know that different stroke victims have different parts of their minds damaged. Most of Jill's book applies to any person who has experienced brain trauma, but some specific details will vary.Jill wants us to know that doctors are *wrong* to say that ""If you don't have your abilities back by six months,... you won't.""""I needed my visitors to bring me their positive energy.... I appreciated when people came in for just a few minutes, took my hands in theirs, and shared softly and slowly how they were doing, what they were thinking, and how they believed in my ability to recover... nervous, anxious, or angry people were counter-productive.""Here's advice to anyone who feels vulnerable to moods like fretfulness, resentment, or self-pity. ""Although there are certain limbic (emotional) programs that can be triggered automatically, it takes less than 90 seconds for one of these programs to be triggered, surge through our body, and then be completely flushed out of our blood stream.... If I remain angry [for example] then it is because I have chosen to let that circuit continue to run. Moment by moment, I make the choice to either hook into my neurocircuitry or move back into the present moment, allowing that reaction to melt away as fleeting physiology.""To help her break that circuit, Dr. Jill says ""I wait 90 seconds.. and then I speak to my brain as though it is a group of children. I say with sincerity, 'I appreciate you ability to think thoughts and feel emotions, but I am really not interested in thinking these thoughts or feeling these emotions anymore. Please stop bringing this stuff up.""""In extreme situations of cellular disregard, I use my authentic voice to put my language center's Peanut Gallery on a strict time schedule. I give my story-teller full permission to whine rampantly between 9-9:30... If it accidentally misses whine time it is not allowed to reengage in that behavior until its next allotted appointment.... I am serious about not hooking into those negative loops of thought.""Instead, she keeps a handy list of good things to think about: ""1) I remember something fascinating that I would like to ponder more deeply, 2) I think about something that would bring me terrific joy, or 3) I think about something I would like to do.""Instead, she keeps a handy list of good things to think about: ""1) I remember something fascinating that I would like to ponder more deeply, 2) I think about something that would bring me terrific joy, or 3) I think about something I would like to do.""Whew. Those are all the bookdarts. But I'm glad that I took the time to type them all up. So valuable. :)Yes, I know this a long review of a short book. Still, Dr. Jill writes clearly and concisely - there's a lot of benefit to you to read the book yourself"
10,1430300612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/901783-happyreader,4,"For me, the most fascinating part of this book is the description of the actual stroke and the immediate aftermath. To have suffered such a traumatic brain injury and live to tell about it in such detail is amazing. Doubly amazing for verbalizing what a brain is like when it goes non-verbal.One funny detail during the stroke is that, while she's rapidly losing the ability to conceptualize numbers and language, somehow part of her brain still knew she needed HMO approval prior to using emergency services -- and found the HMO card and called her HMO doctor without really knowing what a doctor or numbers really were. Fear of medical bills is apparently deeply entrenched in our neural circuitry. Which is also the only reason I can think of to explain her medical collegue not calling for an ambulance after she contacted him. Oh, the brain cells that were lost simply because he drove over rather than letting paramedics quickly deal with the situation.But that's just my left brain talking. While I loved the perspective of what it's like to be temporarily without your left hemisphere, by the end of the book, I felt she was overly left-brain negative. Once the narrative is no longer propelled forward by illness and recovery, the language becomes too cutesy puppies, rainbows, and ponies, pseudo-spiritual for my taste. Lovely message but true spirituality balances the good with real issues, rather than pleasant platitudes.Five stars for the fascinating insight into strokes and brain function minus one star for the overly cutesy writing towards the end."
11,1430300612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1727053-erin,1,"Warning: This is long, contains ranting, and is rather harsh at times.From a biology perspective, this book was crazy cool, as are most things biological. The brain is ridiculously amazing. It completely blows my mind whenever I think about it. However, from a writing perspective, I was not a fan. I would now like to preface the rest of my analytical, left-brain comments by saying that: The author had a stroke, it is absolutely incredible how well she has recovered, and I have no idea whatsoever how the stroke may have affected her writing capabilities. Also, I really did approach this expecting to really, really like it, so this one can't be blamed on a negative attitude. That said, I found the book ridiculously redundant. I'd read one paragraph, move on to the next, and then have to return to the previous paragraph to try and find the difference between the two (other than word order). This frustrated me, and I felt she could have condensed things from 20 chapters to about 8. The parts that I really appreciated were her account of the actual experience of having a stroke and the initial chapters that explained some basic brain science. I'm sure the description of her recovery is very helpful to those dealing with a stroke or helping someone else deal with it, but this was the point where the repetition got out of control. After about page 100, it took serious effort for me to finish (and that rarely happens). Also, I was unaware when I began the book that the second half would be filled with motivational, self-help type crap. Had I known that, I probably would not have read it. That kind of thing drives me insane (and yes, I DO realize that I'm allowing myself to be driven insane) because they try to make it sound easy, and it's not. What particularly bothered me in this instance was that only after the author suffered tremendous brain trauma was she able to ""step to the right [side of her brain:]"" and, to simplify, let a bunch of crap go. I, however, have not suffered from a stroke, still experience the two hemispheres of my brain as a single consciousness, and am generally much harder-pressed to ""step to the right."" So back off, lady!Some other notes: When I first heard the title, I thought it was very clever. However, I began to worry after the 5th or so time she used it in the first 2-3 chapters. And sure enough, the phrase didn't go away. It instead became so overused that it practically triggered my gag reflex by the end of the book. Also, the purpose of having an editor is to make a book better, especially by adding/removing things that will drive people to want to burn the book. This editor was either asleep, drunk, or high, as evidenced by the truly apalling and nauseating over-use of italics and exclamation points."

She is not expected to recover, but with her knowledge, the dedication of and help from her mother as well as keeping naysayers out of her life Bolte regained all of her pre-stroke functioning.

13,1430300612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7549960-bonnie-jean,1,"I absolutely couldn't stand this book. Unfortunately, I didn't realize that until I was over a third of the way into it, at which point I had to finish it, detesting myself the entire time.The woman who wrote this book is a neuroanatomist who had a unique and amazing opportunity to document the experience of having a hemorrhagic stroke from someone who understands how different parts of the brain function.That being said, she is not a brain surgeon. She is not a clinician. And yet from the way she writes this book, she acts as though she knows more than everyone who took care of her, without a real understanding of practical application.For example, she criticizes the nurses who wake her up on an hourly or near hourly basis to do neuro exams--not realizing that is, in fact, a safety check designed to save her life if her bleed became worse. She criticizes doctors for asking questions that she could not answer such as ""Who is the president?"" and felt they should have asked questions that she would have actually been able to answer--such as who the president was married to--not recognizing that the point of asking a simple question such as ""who is the president?"" is not an effort to make her feel good about herself, but to recognize deficits and thus help her to work past them. It would be fruitless to only ask questions she knew she could get right. I felt that the entire book was her outcry to the world, her defense about her embarrassment of being a stroke victim and to show how actually competent she was the entire time. She writes as though she is the only person ever who this has happened to. Although hemorrhagic strokes are the least common kind of stroke, we see them all the time where I work. We don't judge people who are having strokes because they cannot speak properly--we care for them, we monitor them, we help them. No educated medical professional would accuse a stroke victim of being stupid--and yet she seems to feel the need to show everyone how smart and aware she is.Instead of taking this opportunity to truly examine the human condition of stroke victims everywhere, she makes a narcissistic, egotistical, and what I view as a dangerously false view of the stroke experience. I would be highly concerned for family members of my patients and what they may take away from reading this book. The author, although very well versed in brain anatomy, has a poor understanding of how intensive care and hospital care really work--but because of her degree and viewpoint, people may mistake her opinions for truth.The good things I took away from this: a reminder of what it is like to be the patient (always important to keep in mind. ) I agreed with her about the importance of sleep and healing the brain--with the caveat that a patient's safety (you know, ensuring they don't herniate their brain)--should come first, depending on the gravity of the situation. I enjoyed her contrast of left and right brain. Other than that, I wish I hadn't my time and highly recommend that you don't waste yours. There are other, better, and more accurate materials out there for your reading pleasure. PS: This is the only negative book review I have ever added to this website. That's how concerned I am about the spread of misinformation delivered by this book. PPS: You would think that someone with a PhD with a career in brain science would have known better than to get on a treadmill and take a shower while being actively aware that she had stroke symptoms. This should discredit her story from the start. Time is brain, people! If you have stroke symptoms, call 911!"

She described her experience of having a stroke, the loss of her faculties, her surgery, and recovery over a period of almost a decade, to someone like the woman she was before the stroke.Her description of how to help a stroke victim on their return from a hospital are remarkable. The relationship between herself and her mother, who taught her how to see and think and read and move again, is remarkable and touching. Most important, it offers proof and hope to stroke victims and their families for as complete a recovery as is possible.If someone you know has a stroke, or if a family member or close friend has a stroke, but this book for them and the people who love them ASAP. I keep a couple of spare copies on hand to give away. There is one in my car in case I need one while I am at a hospital."
15,1430300612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85897-ken,3,"You couldn't invent a more interesting premise: Dr. Taylor, a brain scientist, has a major stroke and goes through years of rehabilitation after the left hemisphere of her brain is severely damaged. She ultimately recovers and records her detailed memories of the stroke and its aftereffects.Dr. Taylor has given a talk on this subject at a TED Conference -- see the video at http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/ji... This is what drew me to reading My Stroke of Insight, and the book does deliver on its promise before it veers off into territory that I couldn't quite appreciate.Dr. Taylor begins with some basic, fundamental brain science, to set the scene. It's written to be understandable to the layperson, and succeeds on that account. She then describes the day of her stroke, combining recollections of her experience with reminders of the science behind the events that occurred.This is fascinating stuff, allowing us to satisfy our curiosity and learn something at the same time.Then, Dr. Taylor spends the rest of the book sharing her recovery experience, including the epiphany that she had as a result of the stroke. She explains that her damaged left hemisphere gave her right hemisphere a chance to flourish, and thus taught her the value of her right hemisphere. She contrasts her blissful experience of right-brained living with our culture's emphasis on the left hemisphere's reason, task-orientation and linear thinking.She has a point -- but I didn't really appreciate the feeling that I was reading a self-help book with no clear path to actually helping one's self! This part of the book features too much repetition, and too many shiny promises of bliss awaiting us, if we only knew how to get there. Short of having a stroke, all we get is advice that amounts to: meditate, and tell your left hemisphere to be quiet. Prune it back. It sounds good in theory, but this is slippery stuff.I recommend this book for its unique look into how our brains work and what happens when they go wrong. Just know, going in, that you may or may not appreciate the unusual combination of science, memoir and self-help."
16,1430300612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1291915-lauren,3,"There's great value here - but you have to wade through a lot to get to it. Taylor's step-by-step recalling of her hemorrhagic left-hemisphere stroke was both enlightening and tedious. She was so acutely aware of what was happening - enough to describe in full detail here - but unable to really do anything about it. Once discovered, completely unable to comprehend and communicate, she goes through months of recovery, including a surgery to clear the blood clot. Her mother gently and compassionately cares for her, and over time and with a team of help, she learns to speak, read, move, and drive again. I wasn't expecting such a metaphysical post-stroke synthesis in the second-half of the book, but I quite liked it - copying quotes down for future reference. (It was because of this section that I decided to go with 3-stars for the review - the beginning was 2-star territory for me.)
Since the hemorrhage, my eyes have been opened to how much choice I actually have about what goes on between my ears.
Taylor describes neuroplasticity in the simplest of terms. She describes the power to exert control over what areas of her brain to ""turn back on"" after the stroke. She chose to leave the anxiety ""circuitry"" unwired, along with the negativity and ego-centers of the left hemisphere. It's an interesting account, but I feel that there is a lot more to the story. I am curious, as this stroke occurred 20 years ago now in 1996, how Taylor's life continued to change after this altering event.It was a quick read, and I found the section on caring for someone who is in this non-verbal state especially helpful. "
17,1430300612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21018510-lindah,5,"When this fascinating book, My Stroke of Insight, came into my life...my husband picked it up at the library...I thought, Nice title! and that was that. I wasn't up for a book about a person having a stroke. Even when I heard that the author, Jill Bolte Taylor, is a brain scientist, I didn't appreciate how riveting and instructive her narrative could be. Fortunately, after a barrage of raves from my husband, I finally started to read it. Taylor was 36, and alone at home, when she had her stroke. It took her about the same number of minutes (35) to piece together the images in her right brain (her left was hemorrhaging) in order to call her colleague at Harvard. She wasn't able to talk, but he recognized her sounds. It took her eight years to make a full recovery. Not only did she return to teaching, she wrote this book--an intimate account of her brain, during the stroke and during her recovery, AND the by-far best description of right and left brain activity. I am going to recommend this book to all my friends interested in recovery issues (Taylor has a lot of good advice), all the moms in my life (Taylor lays out in detail the left brain/right brain phenomenon), and all the caregivers I know (Taylor has a lot to say about caregiving too)."
18,1430300612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/55374376-mary-vogelsong,4,"This book is an amazing story of a neuro-scientist who experiences her own stroke. She not only recognizes obvious symptoms like loss of speech and one-sided paralysis, but she can envision what is happening on the cell level in her brain.Fortunately, with the extreme patience and love of her mother, she eventually regains enough function to live on her own and resume work. Some parts of her job are too stressing and now too difficult, so she works out a different job description with her boss. Part of her job before involved travel and speaking. She moved into that role full time. I watched some videos of the author online, and she is clearly highly intelligent and very articulate. She considerd herself fully recovered at eight years post-stroke.Taylor's ""stroke of insight"" (a phrase used over and over in the book) mainly refers to her decision not to allow any negative thoughts, ego, or stress that normally generates from the left brain (the side assaulted by the stroke) to enter her life post-stroke. She makes a conscious effort to verbally thank the cells, organs and systems in her body for doing a good job. She also relates a lot of her understanding of how the right brain works to negative or positive energy that she is now able to intuit to guide her life."
19,1430300612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2613351-linda-robinson,5,"From the anatomically correct stained glass brain on the front (which the author made, a second version displayed at Harvard) to the back cover praise, this is an intriguing, educational, dually mindful book about the 50 trillion cells that make a human being go. Dr. Bolte Taylor's journey back into both sides of her brain, after the left hemisphere of her brain took an unauthorized 8 year sabbatical is a story that needs to be required reading for staff at nursing homes, assisted living centers, hospitals and in homes with anyone living with a mental/cognitive impairment. Her Recommendations for Recovery in the back ought to be posted in all healthcare facilities. This memoir is a personal and scientific account of how our brains function, how we can help improve that function just by being aware of the neurocircuitry and physiological effects of how we think. Did you know the left brain is the storyteller? Given not enough information, the left hemisphere will make stuff up and make us believe it's true. And we can instruct it what to pay attention to. She calls it tending our garden. Dr. Taylor offers the reader the power to create the human being the reader wants to be. Awesome, heady territory. I appreciate her sharing this gift to humankind, and me personally."
20,1430300612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5862823-brian-eshleman,4,"This compact memoir of a neuroscientist's experience of stroke and recovery made for extremely compelling reading. She was able to vividly describe the symptoms of her oncoming stroke and also affect if we describe the impact of the experience. Her candor about the immediate and ongoing impact of the attitude of her caregivers, whether condescending, patient, or encouraging, definitely made me as a reader involved in another helping profession examine the messages I give off in my verbal and nonverbal communication.Her approach to recovery brought me to consider how I think about the discipleship of what Scripture considers the fallen mind, mine and other people's I might influence. The effective caregiver, discipler, if you will, doesn't make patronizing assumptions about the impact of the fall on each individual. Just like the effective caregiver of the stroke patient assesses what still works and what doesn't, I am called to consciously go into each personal encounter looking for how this person STILL reflects the image of God, celebrate them, advocate for them, and then, maybe, in the context of a mutually supportive relationship, go about helping them to problem-solve in an individualized way.Her emphasis on the power of rest and the recovering brain was also evocative, I thought, for anyone undergoing or hoping for change. She slept A LOT in recovery, and she found that this gave her healing brain time to absorb new information and a new sense of identity. Too often, I want to accomplish change in myself and those around me at microwave speed, and this is just as counterproductive in a spiritual sense as it is in the realm of neuroscience. Touching gently on an area I want to see changed, resting from the fight for change, and then coming back to it, will, no doubt make me a more effective change agent."
21,1430300612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/175480-helen-helena-nell,3,"This book had quite an interesting effect as soon as it entered the house. My other half, who doesn't read this kind of thing, immediately picked it up and read the first few chapters. Then he got quite agitated. It appeared it was a very accurate account of what it's like to have a stroke from the inside. He should know because he's had one. I haven't. However, he didn't read the whole book.I read the whole book. It is extremely interesting. Not just because of the account of having a stroke from the inside -- which I could closely relate to. I'm not a scientist but I imagine that in this situation I too would be watching and wondering about what was happening to me. The most interesting point of the book, I guess, is the way Jill Bolte Taylor gains access to the deep peace part of her brain, through the experience of damage. She stops being her everyday functional self. That means she can just be, and being is a blissful experience for her. I want to think this sense of ourselves is there, so I'm halfway to liking this book from the start.As it went on, the simplicity of the division between ""the euphoric nirvana of the intuitive right brain"" and ""the logical awareness of the left brain"" began to irritate me somewhat, much as it does in any simplified right brain left brain stuff. Towards the end -- and this is not at all a rational reaction to the book -- I began to wonder how much I liked the author as a person. There was something that made me a bit uneasy. I still don't quite know what it was. It is probably to do with the way she writes, which to me is part of who she is. Something about the phrase ""my two hemispheric personalities"" does not agree with me.When traumatic events happen to us we interpret them according to our lights, our instincts, our hemispheric personalities. This book is reassuring in many ways. I loved the idea that the author lost herself ""as a single, a solid, an entity with boundaries that separated [her] from the entities around"" and instead ""understood that at the most elementary level"" she was ""a fluid"". That thought interests me enormously. The point at which our sense of ourselves as individuals seeps into whatever we are as life forms.Towards the end I thought she got a bit repetitive. She had said what she had to say, which was mainly an account of a true experience, but then she kept commenting on it, kept commenting, kept commenting. And she uses an awful lot of exclamation marks. I am English, living in Scotland, a place where exclamation marks only happen in high drama or comedy. I like understatement and this book doesn't do a lot of that.However, I'm extremely glad I read it. It is life-enhancing and thought provoking, two things you don't get every day."
22,1430300612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5957376-catherine,1,"I have a feeling I would have enjoyed this book more if I weren't a neuroscientist myself. First the good parts -- her account of lucidly experiencing a hemorrhagic stroke, when combined with her basic knowledge of human brain structure, was the most interesting part of the book. Furthermore, she provides excellent advice for doctors, nurses, and caretakers of patients dealing with a stroke and its aftermath.Where the book began to go wrong for me was its overly simplistic view of brain structure and function. Now, I realize that this was written for a general audience and it is not meant to be a neuroscience textbook. But, for some people this may be one of very few books on the brain that they may read, and she uses her neuroscience background as a selling point. Therefore I think she has a greater responsibility to be more clear about which ""facts"" she is presenting come from actual scientific studies, and which come from her personal experience and opinion. Very few scientific statements are backed up with citations of peer-reviewed literature. Her reduction of the brain into ""left"" and ""right"" is far too simple and rather misleading. Where the story really went off the rails was the rather repetitive section on her life now and how she ""steps over to"" the right side of her brain to be ""at one with the universe,"" and how she gives thanks for the ""molecular geniuses"" in her cells that allow her to, among other things, poop. This may sound mean, but my general impression on reading her story is that Taylor has a rather inflated sense of her accomplishments as a neuroscientist. Out of curiosity I checked her publication record and, frankly, it was not impressive - only two first author papers, one of which was in a tiny online-only journal that is now defunct. This is not a crime, of course, but she has been promoting herself as a ""Harvard neuroscientist,"" which to the general public brings with it a sense of authority and scholarship. Overall, I think the book would have benefited greatly by having a currently active researcher or neurologist as a co-author, to provide the ""science"" side while Taylor would provide the ""personal"" side. But I reckon that Taylor's ego and pride (which she claims has been lessened as a result of her stroke) wouldn't have let her entertain that arrangement."

It had moments of greatness, and moments of ""really?"", but I thought the message was solid and something worth being reminded of. Particularly Dr. Taylor's experience while her stroke was happening was really an intense and one of the powerful sections i have read in a long time.

24,1430300612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5248532-ondrej,5,"I listened to CD set recording of Jill’s book only after my own mini-stroke a year ago & small stroke nearly a half-year ago. Like Jill, I was able to feel and observe some very similar feelings and thoughts for from about a few hours & up to about a day during my stroke. Regardless of whether you’re recovering from a stroke or supporting a stroke survivor, I think Jill’s book is a must-read for everyone. It can help us all gain a better understanding of the events & issues surrounding stroke. My advice: Whether you’re a survivor or care-giving loved on, NEVER give up! The human brain is amazing! Today I almost can't tell that I had one. Was I extremely lucky? I definitely believe so. And Jill? Yes, VERY lucky and extremely fortunate for everything everyone—and especially her mom—did to help her over her eight-year recovery period as she continued struggling and progressing toward such amazing end-results! If possible, I’d’ve given her book 6 stars for her strong message of hope, trial and error, and persistence against all odds. I do wish I had known about her book before my stroke. It woul’ve helped me greatly as I, my loved ones, and those around me faced, worked, and struggled together with me through all my many challenges and post-stroke issues. It also would’ve better helped ME understand what both of my parents went through with their own strokes many years before. Many thanks, Jill, for sharing your experience and offering words of hope and encouragement to so many others—survivors and care-givers alike! "
25,1430300612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3131238-judy,4,"While I found the anatomical explanation of a stroke interesting and the tour of how the brain works equally engaging, the remaining chapters on the possibility of obtaining peace through the right brain fascinated me. IMO,this is Bolte-Taylor's stroke's biggest contribution to science. The impact provides more help to us, average joes and jills than millions of dollars in donations to brain research. I like the author's means of sharing her insight in a practical and understandable way.What keeps this from being a 5 star book is the repition of certain phrases and thoughts especially in the first half. She may be wanting to emphasize a point, but it would have been easier to listen to if the delivery of the sentiment were varied, not using the exact same words. The second problem I had was that the author was the narrator for my audio book and her voice grated on me. However, neither of these things could dull my appreciation of the information she shared. I am thankful that she took the pains to record what happened to her in order to share the benefits with others. "
26,1430300612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/642041-sarah,4,"Four stars for the accessible explanations of brain function and warning signs of stroke. Four stars for the fascinating walk through the day of Dr. Taylor's stroke, and for her descriptions of the recovery process. Four stars for her observations about medical care and the attitudes of doctors and nurses and visitors. Three stars for the lengthy exercises in right brain exploration, which were fascinating but a little too fluffy for me. I listened to the audio version on a lengthy drive, and the second half of the book functioned as a yoga nidra meditation. It turned itself into background while Dr. Taylor went on and on about how she chooses to remain positive. There were definitely some lessons to be taken from that section as well - about our ability to purposefully shift out of bad or useless states of mind, in particular - but a lot of it seemed to be insights that were particularly possible for her because she had been shifted so far out of her left mind. "
27,1430300612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7986781-heidi-the-reader,3,"My takeaway learning moment from this is Jill's idea that a powerful emotion, once triggered, only remains a pure physical process for about 90 seconds. After that time, we make a conscious decision to ""hook"" into that emotion to prolong it or not. We can chose to react a different way if we desire. I found that to be empowering."
28,1430300612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20494551-tweedledum,5,"What a fascinating and inspiring book. Jill's description of her experience of losing her left brain thinking skills due to a stroke in the left hemisphere, which meant that she could no longer read or interpret language, speak or recall words or their meanings but instead experienced the world of the senses much more vividly, often painfully while experiencing a deep sense of belonging and wonder living only in the moment, the now, is profound and rang a lot bells for me. Working with young people on the spectrum I realised that what I am often seeing is children who are primarily right OR left brain dominant ... Extreme one way or the other... So that makes me ask myself is the challenge then to foster the connections across the brain? Sometimes I see kids who flip between one side and the other... Jill gave a vivid and fascinating description of the way her senses became extreme either not functioning at all... Colour blind..... Or painful... Light, sound, smell... She had to relearn through touch and kinaesthetic learning. Though she could understand some words and gradually speech came back she took a very long time to relearn to interpret pencil ""squiggles"" and how they related to sounds. So many of the children I see are overwhelmed by their senses... They cannot pick out words from the noisiness of the environment though to everyone else that does not seem noisy, they are fascinated by light, movement. At one point Jil describes how she could only pick out people if they moved. I have children on my caseload like that... Walking over peers to get to something. Fascinated and riveted by moving toys. It makes me wonder if it is possible that some of these children have suffered mini strokes at some point??? No one routinely does a brain scan when diagnosing ASD.... Though I couldn't find any evidence in the literature for this .... Maybe this is a crazy idea... But the children who start talking and then lose skills.... Become aphasic does anyone suggest a scan here? What seemed clear to me is that the left brain... The language side, helps modify and manage the sensory experience of the right brain. Yet the right brain is linked to high creativity.... When Jill could not find a link... ""What is tuna? "" her mother simply helped her recreate that link... Here it is... Taste it.... Learn by doing.... Jill talked about losing depth perception.... Having to relearn not simply how to walk, move her body in space but how to interpret the visual information in front of her... Grey is pavement... It feels hard ... Green is grass you step down into it... None of this could be relearn the through talk or reading... It had to be experienced. Another very important point Jill makes is how plastic the brain really is... It really can go on learning throughout life. Jill deplored those doctors who tell their stroke patients "" if you haven't regained skills within 6 months you never will."" Explaining that it took her 8 years to regain all her skills but equally pointing out.... She is now a different person... She thinks differently to how she did before the stroke. She has insight into her right brain and is more able to access this and switch off negative thinking created by the left brain. Jill talked about her surprise at how once her left brain started functioning again it was very quick to make up stories to explain things.... These ""stories "" she quickly found felt true but often were completely wrong due to lack of information. The left brain makes up stories.... It gives explanations to us. It doesn't care or know if these are true.... Here then is the seat of the imagination. She learned she had to be mistrustful of what her brain was telling her and check everything out. Again this resonates very much with many of the able pupils I see who can easily become convinced that they're interpretation of things is correct even though there may be overwhelming evidence to the contrary. The brain loves stories.... Jill also talked about re-entering a world where the boundaries between real and unreal were very fluid.... This made me think about the need to cherish this wide eyed wonder in our children because this is part of learning .... So many parents panic when they discover their child has an imaginary friend, or when they talk about fantasy characters as though they are real.... Do we need to panic... Or do we simply need to offer them more and positive real life experiences.... ? Jill talked about the need for her would be teachers and helpers to be infinitely patient and kind. To believe that she could do it. To teach over again with the same patience and kindness no matter how many times they had done that before.... So important. Who are we to make judgements about what another person SHOULD be able to do.One more thing.... Jill explained that her mother never asked yes or no questions because these taught nothing and were too easy to answer yet did not reveal whether Jill truly knew the answer. We can all say yes or no to get someone off our back....Instead she gave choices.... But slowly, and when she suggested something Jill didn't know introduced that thing.... To be touched, tasted, experienced. Again I think of how we talk to our ASD children.... We can learn from this insight.... The need to show not tell. To offer opportunities for learning by experience. I could go on and on. And I haven't even touched on its significance for stroke victims or the way it may alert an individual to early warning signs of stroke giving them a chance of summoning help. You can see Jill lecturing about this here https://www.ted.com/talks/jill_bolte_..."
29,1430300612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12860715-librarycin,4,"Jill Bolte Taylor was a single, 37-year old neuroanatomist (brain scientist), when she, herself, suffered a stroke. This book tells her story of the stroke and her 8 year recovery. The first part of the book explained some of the science of the brain. Have to admit that my mind wandered during parts of this section, but from what I heard, she was making it easy enough to understand. I was listening to the audio, which of course, makes it a bit easier for my mind to wander. The author read the audio herself and did a very good job, but apparently she also does public speaking (she has done a TED Talk about this). The second part of the book describes the stroke and her recovery. She lost use of the left side of her brain (the analytical part) and actually seemed to enjoy simply using her right brain for a while, not worrying about her ego, feeling compassion and inner peace, etc. Oddly enough, the book was amusing at times even while she was describing her stroke (she was excited to be able to “study” a stroke first-hand!) and in some descriptions of her recovery (“tuna… tuna?… tuna” in different tones of voice as she racked her brain, trying to figure out what tuna was). I was amazed at how child-like she was and how much she needed to re-learn! This was the most interesting part of the book for me.The last section of the book described the right brain vs the left brain and talked a lot about inner peace and such. Overall, I really liked this book. "
30,1430300612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3381014-bert-edens,5,"Like many, I was led to this book by Dr. Taylor's keynote speech of the same name on YouTube. It was fascinating to read her take on not only the morning of the stroke, but who she was before the stroke and who she chose to become after the stroke. The latter half is a key component of the book, as when Dr. Taylor found her left brain, the judgmental, ego-centric portion of our brain, offline and inoperable, needing to be literally rebuilt on a neuron level of eight years, she found she could choose how it was rebuilt. She found she could control what her left brain had to say and how often. Of course, that means we can each consciously choose the same, if we so choose.I was also fascinated from a medical perspective, as my older son has no corpus callosum, and many issues he faces mirror those Dr. Taylor faced during her recovery process. While his corpus callosum can't be rebuilt, it's still a marvel daily to see how his brain has ""found a way"" to do things we were told he would never be able to do. This is a great, fascinating read, for all those who love stories of tragedy and triumph, those with a love of medical stories, and even those Zen/Buddhist sorts, as her Stroke Of Insight will sound very familiar :)"
31,1430300612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/504424-bup,3,"I liked the book. Perhaps putting it on my science shelf is questionable, but I thought it belonged on there more than not. But it's perhaps a 55/45 proposition.Taylor's writing voice is somewhat bland, and full of stock phrases and cliche, but the woman's story is incredible. If a woman can recover - basically completely - from the size of a stroke she had, then there's hope for everybody. That's what makes the book so much worth reading. On the other hand, everything is so positive - she's nothing but grateful for every person and every experience - that it can be trying to read. I just wanted her, at some point, to say: ""You know what, though? Having a stroke sucks! Aphasia sucks! Imagine trying to be in the world where you suddenly can't talk and can't read! It's sucky!"" She never did, though. You'd never get any sense that we shouldn't all be jealous of her.Maybe just knowing she made it is enough, though. Watching her TED talk might be as good as reading the book.Anyway, as much as Susan and I rolled our eyes at some of the passages, it still made us more hopeful (I need another word for hope - is there one?) for the future."
32,1430300612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1325700-homeschoolmama,2,"I approached this book with a lot of optimism. I'd expected Taylor's story to be a straight-up memoir of her stroke experience. Instead, it was a sort of hodge-podge of things- part memoir, part brain science overview and part new-age, self help weird '4th grade happy talk' as another reviewer aptly described. The actual story of her stroke experience was interesting; even her bio-science chapters about how the brain works were intriguing and easy to understand (at least to me), but the last third of the book was just plain weird. She encourages her readers to get in touch w/their right brains. Talk to your cells! Thank them for a great day! Repeat peaceful mantras and find Nirvana! .. If it were that easy to attain ultimate peace and nirvana, there would be no more wars, no need for psychotherapy, and mental illness would be a thing of the past.I am glad Taylor found equilibrium and healing after her stroke. I'm glad she shared her experience as a stroke victim. I just wish she'd stuck more with the actual story of it than venture into lectures ala John Bradshaw and Joel Osteen."

At the age of 37, she suffered a massive, life threatening stroke which left her paralyzed on her right side, unable to walk, speak, read, or understand the meaning of most words. She describes what she can remember about the stroke and the early hours of her hospitalization. She then details her long and arduous road to recovery over the next eight years. Dr. Taylor's advice on how to interact with stroke victims is invaluable for caregivers and medical personnel as well. Although this is a short book, it takes awhile to read because of some of the detailed information that is included. The first two chapters give insightful information on the way both hemispheres of the brain function. This is a fascinating book that will leave you in awe of the way our brains work, and of their ability to reconnect and recover after suffering major trauma. "
34,1430300612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1320429-joanne-sperans,5,"Amazing true life story of a neuroscientist who suffered a major stroke. She tells how she watched her body and brain change during the stroke, what worked best for her recovery, how she learned to differentiate between the left and right hemispheres of her brain - when she was letting her brain/thoughts run the show, and when she was allowing herself to just BE in the world. This is an incredible story from a medical standpoint, very intriguing and informative. And it's a fabulous story of self-discovery, with tools we can all use to help stop the needless chatter in our brains and focus on being in the here and now."

36,1430300612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14468-joyce,2,"Thought I'd be more engaged than I was in this book. The writing is pretty flat. Her blow-by-blow description of her thoughts and physical sensations mid-stroke were astonishing, though. How did she retain her memory of all the details? Eh, guess I shouldn't have skimmed."
37,1430300612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1266077-stephen-gallup,4,"A scientist friend recommended this memoir to me several years ago. At the time we were no doubt discussing my developmentally disabled son, who is nonverbal (and incidentally the subject of my own memoir). Specifically, our topic was probably my inability to know what he experiences and perceives. I did not immediately rush out to find this book, suspecting it might be dry and of limited relevance to my family's situation. But it did go on my to-read list, and now I've finally read it. Too bad I waited.When confronted with someone who does not speak or otherwise communicate, people often assume there's nothing of consequence going on in the other person's mind. We tend to exclude that person from our conversation or, when we do address him, we do so in a perfunctory way (asking questions to which we don't expect answers, or simply giving basic directions). The perspective Jill Taylor had as a stroke patient may well differ from that of someone like my son, but (knowing him) I suspect there are marked similarities.Following her stoke, Dr. Taylor experienced other people's speech as a confusing auditory assault on her nervous system. Unless spoken quietly and slowly, words were perceived as noise. She describes a frustrating and exhausting encounter with a medical student who tried to interview her without taking into account her impaired processing abilities. Later, she describes the need she had to have someone gently and patiently explain the basics of solving a simple jigsaw puzzle: turning all the pieces rightside-up (and even what that meant), locating the outside edges, using the colors of the pieces as clues in determining which connected with which -- and the very significant effort involved in following through with all that. Until she slowly recovered her former capabilities, letters and even graphic patterns were just random clusters of pixels with no meaning. Later, she could read and understand individual words but still lacked the ability to think linearly and find meaning in a whole written sentence.We take so very much for granted in assuming the other person perceives the same reality we do.Her story is unique in that, as a neuroanatomist, she had a deep prior understanding of how the brain functions and how its different parts relate to one another. That enables her, now that she has regained most of what she'd lost, to shed considerable light on what mental disability may feel like from the inside -- and why. I think any caregiver will feel more compassion and patience, as well as respect for the patient, after reading this. I do.My preconception about the book was not accurate. The telling isn't dry (although some readers might object to the high-level summary of brain anatomy that precedes her story). Also, a lot of this is indeed relevant to my family's story. Listening, I thought the oft-mentioned ""plasticity of the brain"" is a lovely concept, and agreed that caregivers need to believe in it while providing the right kind of cognitive challenges. However, I know from painful experience that more is needed. Dr. Taylor says, ""Recovery was a decision I had to make a million times a day."" The difference between her and someone who has always been disabled (e.g., my son) is that the latter may never seriously grasp the possibility of altering his condition. Disability is all he has ever known. Dr. Taylor says her memory of how it felt to do tasks such as climbing stairs two at a time contributed significantly to her acquiring those abilities again. My son has no such memories to draw upon, and I believe at some point he concluded that the challenge just wasn't worth the effort. In my ignorant enthusiasm, I likely did as much harm as good in trying to push him along; Dr. Taylor says a caregiver's ""highly anxious energy"" can be overwhelming and counterproductive.(In my own defense, and in answer to any readers of my story objecting to the ""mind-numbing obsession with a cure,"" I maintain there's a valid cause for that highly anxious energy: It's recognition of the sure future of someone like my son, who remains totally dependent on others for his basic needs, and almost totally incapable of communicating any specific concerns. I had no other way of responding.)It's interesting and reassuring to absorb the author's observation that even a catastrophic event like a stroke is not necessarily a tragedy. The enormous setback she experienced in terms of function and analytical thinking was offset to some degree by new awareness of her right-brain's affinity for the big picture and emotions of gratitude, peace and unity. Also, during the gradual restoration of her left-brain functions she was able to identify undesirable personality traits that had been neurologically linked to those functions -- and weed them out. As a result, Dr. Taylor probably says she is better for having had the experience. She is also very lucky. Many variables lined up in her favor.Well, this is an important story. Although I began by calling it a memoir, it doesn't entirely fit within that genre. Except for her description of the morning during which she was having the stroke, the author offers little or no dramatization of her experiences. Readers are not exposed to much of the doubts, fears, and frustrations she surely endured but rather get a summary of what happened. Consequently, this isn't as powerful a rendering as it might have been. Also, the concluding third of the text departs from her story to provide guidance on how to turn off negative thoughts in order to live mindfully and connect with inner peace. That seems to be the essence of her insight resulting from the stroke. I found the transition from all that had gone before to be a little jarring, but I'm sure it serves the author's intended purpose. And that's fine."
38,1430300612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/147818-john-wiswell,5,"My favorite piece of science writing since Steven Strogatz's Sync. Neuroanatomist Jill Bolte Taylor gives us a guided tour of her own stroke, which nearly killed her in 1996. While firsthand accounts of health trauma are always valuable, Taylor is uniquely able to explain both how the progression of the stroke felt, and what was happening in her brain as neurons drowned in her own blood. Thanks to medical examinations after the fact, she recognizes that the sensation of not recalling phone numbers for anyone who could help is directly linked to a specific blockage in a pathway. It would be utterly chilling if not for Taylor's optimism and excitement; her first reaction to realizing what was happening was how cool it was to be experiencing something she'd studied.Much of the book concerns Taylor's path to recovery, in which she criticizes the need for patience and tailored time tables, and explains how her own mind was re-developing. She makes strong claims against medical wisdom that any skills not recovered within six months are lost forever, particularly after the part of her brain that dealt with math was damaged, and yet she re-learned those skills years later. Her anecdotes of people lovingly re-explaining the alphabet, literacy and jigsaw puzzles help remove some of the stigma around how infantilizing recovery from trauma can be. The emphasis is always on how care can help, and Taylor doesn't rely on fuzzy feel-good vibes, backing this up with cognitive-related progress reports.While I've suffered many health problems in my life, I've never suffered a stroke. It was surprising how much of what she explained about sudden blanknesses in her personality and linguistic reasoning mapped to my exact experiences of medication failing. Her stories of being unable to handle idioms or complex figures of speech (at one point, ""President of the United States"" took too much linguistic reasoning for her to understand) can relate to many other disorders and trauma recoveries. It's leading me to looking up brain research for insight on what might have hit me this past Spring.The final part of the book might be too New Age for some readers. Taylor has the surprising message of gratitude for having her stroke, as while it deleted much of her personality, it gave her the opportunity to rebuild herself, deliberately learning things on a path to make a happier human being. She tries to compel her readers to reevaluate how they live and figure out social, psychological and dietary methods to happier existences, too. This sometimes reads like standard Self Help, with a positive core message that misses many nuances. Taylor exposes a flawed grasp on the breadth of human psychology when she says she doesn't understand why anyone would choose to be unhappy, which misses the stark challenges of many walks of life, religions and philosophies, and issues such as clinical depression.The bitter irony is that her message is generally helpful, but so rooted in personal epiphany that you probably can only take it to heart for a long time if you undergo something transformative too. But if the book's worst sin is that she's too excited to have conquered her own stroke and rebuilt her career in brain science, then it's done pretty well, hasn't it?"
39,1430300612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2967048-elizabeth,5,"This was a reread for me. I plucked the book off my shelf looking for a particular passage and began to read again. Such an excellent read for anyone. Really. Taylor has such comforting insights, it's hard to pick one. That we can all access Nirvana any time we wish to, is my favorite. It really is true. Anyone who prays (or meditates, if that makes it easier for you) or anyone who has been working hard to quiet the ""chatter"" of their left brain can attest to this.She gives scientifically backed reasons for why worry and negative thinking are time wasters. And goes on to teach you how to silence those thoughts. This is brilliant and undeniably required work for all humans. Being a registered nurse and having tested many times about 60/40 right/left brained, I love both the way she talks about the anatomy and how it works, but also digs deep into the beauty of who we are in the universe. I believe that God is the collective power of our souls and she talks about this power in a way that had me saying, ""Right on, sister."" We are all one and we can tap into that if we want to. What a wonderful world, if we, indeed, did just that.As someone with a chronic illness, I was first attracted to her because of her thoughts on pain. And those thoughts have been oh so helpful. But, what got me, what really got me, was her advocacy for those who can't speak for themselves or for those who, despite all their best efforts, just simply aren't heard by those that love them or even just the general public. ""Be responsible for the energy that you bring,"" to an ill person is ever so important. I can't tell you how many times people have drained me or blamed me or added rather than subtracted from my symptoms. I always knew this, about the energy you bring, but I didn't have words for it. I knew for sure it wasn't me, but now to have the words, I'm just so grateful. Her list of assessment questions and the 40 things she needed the most, I plan (and highly recommend everyone) to copy and place in a very important place for my husband and son. These questions and assessments are so respectful and important. I wish they were in every hospital, clinic, or nursing home break room. Loved also that she reminds everyone that people who are unresponsive are still in there---and they can perceive you completely and accurately. ""I am wounded. Please respect me."" ""Your body is the life force power of some fifty-trillion molecular geniuses. You and you alone choose moment by moment who and how you want to be in the world. I encourage you to pay attention to what is going on in your brain. Own your power and show up for your life. Beam bright!"" "
40,1430300612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/314550-anna,5,"I really enjoyed reading this book, even though I didn't always agree with her 100% and I felt like she became a bit preachy towards the end. It was an extremely engaging read and it helped me understand a lot more about how the brain works. Prior to reading this book (which was required reading for a graduate education class), I really had very little interest in learning about the brain and/or the differences between the left and right brain. This book changed that. Jill Bolte Taylor's account of her stroke made learning about the brain much more meaningful and relevant to me. The book was addicting and the chapters about the stroke and the recovery were particularly fascinating. I felt like I learned a ton about the difference between the two hemispheres of the brain and now have a much deeper understanding of the two and how they work together. So, I really have to thank her for making learning about the brain very interesting.I liked the writing style a lot because it started off kind of like a mystery and then it became a personal narrative and I started to feel really close to Jill and wanted to know all about how is doing now. The only chapters that started to annoy me a bit were the last three. She kept talking about the greatness of the right brain and the importance of not letting the left brain control you (especially when it comes to anger, frustration, or fear) and while I think this is important, it was starting to sound a bit too spiritual for my liking. However, I think this book had an impact on me, my life, my health, and my way of thinking to the point where I feel like I'm actually kind of a changed person. I also have to thank her for making her recovery process so explicit, as I think those chapters have helped me to reflect and become more aware of my level of empathy and sensitivity when it comes to working with students of various backgrounds (special ed kids, struggling learners, ELLs, etc.). After reading this book I wish there was a similar kind of story that I could read about epilepsy so that I could learn more about the disease that my dad is suffering from. If anyone knows of such a book, please let me know...Lastly, I think anyone who reads this book is much more likely to be educated on the signs of a stroke and is much more likely to respond quickly and appropriately when a) someone else is having a stroke and b) if that person ever has a stroke. Since time is of the essence when one is having a stroke, it is important to recognize the warnings signs (which we never ever talk about anywhere!) and to seek help immediately. "
41,1430300612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2672243-shel,3,"This book basically has 3 parts: part neuroscience primer, part memoir, and part self-help book. My 3-star rating is an average of my ratings for these 3 parts (I'd give 2.5 if I could).The book starts with a few chapters giving some basic background on brain science. I've studied quite a bit of neuroscience and didn't feel like I needed the refresher, so I just skimmed over them. They seemed to be written in a way that would be accessible to the average reader.I found the middle section of the book, Dr. Taylor's memoir of her experience as a stroke victim, to be the most interesting, though much more brief than I'd hoped. I was fascinated by Taylor's account of her subjective experience the morning of the stroke - how she never lost consciousness or sense of self, just the ability to communicate with the rest of the world, and how she remembers the experience so clearly even now, years later. I was impressed by the hard work she and her mother put into her recovery. However, I wanted to know more. Her recounting of the experience was fairly superficial and told through what must have been rose-tinted glasses - I can't believe that all of her successes came as simply as she stated, or that she never got frustrated or upset about her situation. I'm all for optimism - I'm a glass-half-full kind of gal myself - but it didn't seem real.And then, while I was wanting to dig deeper into Taylor's story, she veered into territory normally covered by the cheesy self-help gurus you see all over the media, talking about embracing your creative (right-brained!) self, with the spin that this is coming from a real trained neuroscientist who can use words like amygdala! and corpus colossum! with authority. This is where I stopped reading. Meh.Now, I recognize that it's a HUGE accomplishment for anyone who's experienced brain damage in the part of the brain that processes language to write a book - ANY book. But I wish that her editors had done a better job of smoothing out some of her clunky sentences. For example, ""Although the sporadically discontinuous flow of normal cognition was virtually incapacitating, somehow I managed to keep my body on task."" and ""My right mind understands that I am the life force power of the fifty trillion molecular geniuses crafting my form!""The one most valuable part of the book is Appendix B, the list of 40 things she needed most during her recovery from the stroke. Anyone who interacts with a stroke victim should have a copy of this list.In short, I'm glad I read this, though I wish I'd taken it out of the library. At least I got it at a discount from a Borders closing sale!"
42,1430300612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/565777-christina,2,"I had high expectations to this book - and it didn't quite meet them. I expected a personal story of a woman surviving and fully recovering from a major stroke with the added bonus of her being a brain scientist. Instead, it felt like a weird mishmash of three books: An easy introduction to how the brain functions, a personal account of how a stroke feels and the after-effects of it and finally, a sort of self-help book about being in touch with both your brain halves and not letting the analytical left side take over from the emotional right side. For me, this made the book feel very uneven. It's a short book and it is too short to cover all these three aspects.It also rang a bit wrong in my head that she's just grateful for her stroke all the way through - when she had it and realized what was happening, she was mostly just curious as to how it felt. And afterwards, she just constantly chose to focus on the good stuff - it doesn't sound like she had a good cry once and even though you choose to look for the positive aspects of everything, it seems to me that every normal person would break down at least once but she never does apparently - at least she doesn't tell us.I realise that a lot of people going through this kind of experience will discover a new kind of spirituality but the spirituality in this book becomes sort of a physical thing depending on the structure of the brain because it is achieved because the left brain shuts down and the right brain takes over - so she achieves her bliss and feeling of peace because of a malfunction in her brain... Afterwards, she choose to keep her left brain half in check so the right half can be the dominant one and she can be a different person that she was and she shares some ways to do this like checking in with your emotions and learning to react to the signals you get from your body.But overall - this book left me disappointed and the writing didn't quite work for me so parts of the book actually felt rather dull and boring."
43,1430300612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,2,"Someone gave this as their example of what to expect from this book, and, well, it's pretty instructive all on its own:""I unconditionally love my cells with an open heart and grateful mind. Spontaneously throughout the day, I acknowledge their existence and enthusiastically cheer them on. I am a wonderful living being capable of beaming my energy into the world, only because of them. When my bowels move, I cheer my cells for clearing that waste out of my body. When my urine flows, I admire the volume my bladder cells are capable of storing. When I'm having hunger pangs and can't get to food, I remind my cells that I have fuel (fat) stored on my hips. When I feel threatened, I thank my cells for their ability to fight, flee, or play dead.""Plus a lot of being one with the universe, etc.The book actually starts off with a good introduction to what having a stroke is like, albeit I felt that the science was aimed ridiculously low: I felt like even someone who didn't know anything about the brain would get impatient with the tone. It was overly simplistic, maybe even a touch condescending. Still, that's the best part of the book: whatever else you may say about her, Jill Bolte Taylor is a neuroanatomist and can explain very clearly what happens to the brain during a stroke. For that aspect alone, I'm glad I followed up on the rec from the Coursera neurobiology MOOC.But once we get onto oneness with the universe, I'm getting antsy, and once we're thanking our cells for our bowel movements, I'm out the room.Oh, and this review is a good critique of it from the point of view of a clinician."
44,1430300612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/916030-ruzz,2,"I think my view of this book lacked a dimension and that lacking sullied what might have been a marvelous book. The angle I approached the book was--having watched her video on ted--about the mind and it's two halves and their role in cogitation and bliss. The idea of a more concrete delineation between the thinking mind and the feeling mind from someone who had one half turned off for a time seemed really appealing. What turned me off then was 120 of 170 pages devoted to what happened (AVM stroke) and her recovery. I imagine these pages will be invaluable to someone whose had a stroke or is close to someone who has but they were lost on me--beyond a cursory identification with someone else who has had a major medical event in their lives. Not only were they lost but being wrapped in saccharine sweet new-agey touchy feely language made it almost unbearable and I even remarked I may not be able to muster the strength to finish the book (Around pg 120 or so). Fortunately for me then I did finish and in that last 55 or so pages is where the meat of the book resides. It solidly discusses the roles and various flavors of the two mind halves and she has what i consider to be a worth the two stars given, a chapter on how to use your physical body to bring you back closer to a state of joy, or happiness, or flow, or bliss. whatever you want to call it. beyond that chapter, and a few surrounding ideas and thoughts it was all too much mushy love fest for me. why is it we cannot be blissful, happy, joy filled humans without resorting to baby talk?"
45,1430300612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22385-dan,5,"Jill Bolte Tayler, a neuroscientist whose resume includes working for the Harvard Brain Bank, describes the radically altered states of consciousness she achieved after having a stroke. The stroke incapacitated much of the left hemisphere of her brain, which she had allowed to dominate and inhibit the perceptions from her right hemisphere for most of her adult life. Freed from the tyranny of her inner chatterbox's worries and negative thought patterns, she experienced bliss and a sense of oneness with the universe. Although she was tempted to remain in this new state of consciousness forever, she chose to struggle through recovery so that she could regain some of the beneficial features of her left hemisphere, most importantly her language ability. She wanted to communicate her new perceptions with the rest of the world.This book begins with a simple primer on brain physiology and then proceeds into a narrative describing the day Jill had the stroke and the months and years she spent recovering the functions of her left hemisphere. It concludes with Jill's philosophical musings on the wonder of human biology, her Buddhist-sounding suggestions for letting go of pain and suffering and embracing joy, and a few New Age-style ideas about the energy of the universe and the oneness of everything.This is a very well-written and inspiring book. I loved it!"

The unique insight that Taylor brings to the stroke experience is illuminating because she had enough knowledge of her own brain to understand what was happening to her even as it threatened to drown her in its rip tide. She recounts how her altered consciousness shifted its locus among the undamaged parts of her brain even as the hemorrhage lapped at those same parts which struggled to keep her self-aware.I won't spoil the lessons of consciousness that she learned; read it in her singular account to fully appreciate it. But appreciate it you must even though it may scare you to learn just how dependent we are on our fragile neurons to perceive the world around us. Even though I don't align myself with the new-agey spiritualism that this experience led her to, I am profoundly grateful she shared her journey with the rest of us."

This book describes her experience and, more importantly, explained it in terms of how the brain works (based on her background as a brain scientist), and finally how she recovered from it. In particular, the stroke essentially shut down her left hemisphere and its operations, which primarily affect language and the perception of time. With the left brain shut down, her more fluid right brain, which perceives things more wholistically, gave her a sense of oneness and happiness. Then began the long process of recovery, learning to speak, read, learning the meanings of words, etc. Eventually, she was able to recover or rebuild many/most of her abilities. But with her understanding of what had happened, she was able to focus on maintaining a better balance between her left and right brain. In particular, she was able to temporarily slow down (if not shut down) her left brain willfully; she was able to slow down the constant brain chatter what defines us, and curtail loops of anger or negativity. Thus she was able to restrain spend more time perceiving wholistically with the right brain, which is precisely what meditation intends to do.Well worth reading. "

It is the story of 37 year old Jill Taylor, a brain scientist and advocate who suffered a hemorrhagic stroke and through recovering and healing had her own stroke of insight into the magnificent power of the brain. I really liked this story. It starts out by explaining each part of the brain and what each part's function is. Then she relates what she recalls about her stroke and her road to recovery. It took her 8 years of working hard to return to what she felt was her normal-prestroke abilities. The back of the book has lots of ideas from Dr. Taylor about what helped and didn't help her during recovery, and gives great insight to those care-givers helping stroke victims. I read it to my mom to see if certain things would trigger memory for her, or at least help her know better what happened to her. My favorite thing about this book is the insight it gave into what each part of the brain does--the peace-filled right hemisphere that we can connect into if we learn how--and the dominant orderly-logical left hemisphere--and how amazing the brain and body are at healing themselves and recovering data.

50,1430300612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/622596-elizabeth,5,"Truly poignant and interesting book that has stayed with me since I began reading it. Written by a neuroatonomist who suffered a rare form of stroke at the age of 37, this story was compelling not only for the biological and scientific implications of stroke on the human brain, but also on a personal and human level in terms of how to rebound after injury. Dr. Taylor worked extremely hard to rewire and regain functionality of her brain. I found the writing to be a little forced, specifically when the author described herself and her personal history, which is directly attributable to her stroke as well as her training as an analytical and scientific writer. Despite the stiff wording at times, her story is incredible, especially since she was able to regain much of the functionality of her brain. Her appreciation for the efficacy of her body and for the gift of life was refreshing and also made me as the reader reflect as well. Highly recommended for anyone interested in brain biology, stroke rehabilitation, and personal perspective."

I wish I had read this book sooner as it would have been helpful to have Jill's insight.

I am glad for the times I resisted the urge to force small talk and to just enjoy her quiet dignity by being present and holding her hand. Glad that I brought whatever items she thought she needed even if it was not practical ( her sneakers, for example) I am grateful for my children who kept visits short and simple and gave small kindnesses of painting her nails, helping her with hand lotion, brushing her hair and gentle hugs. Grateful also for my oldest daughter who crawled in the bed with her grandmother and wrapped her in warm hugs. Perspective matters in my review. "

I mean what are the chances that an accomplished neuroanatomicist would have a nirvana like experience as a result of a stroke and would survive to tell about with such painstaking detail.One reason why this book has resonated so much with is because it came at a time when I started reading quite a bit of literature about mindfulness and meditation (e.g. The Untethered Soul, by Michael Singer). I now kinda understand the concept of the soul being ""one"" with the universe. The energy theory and the law of attraction are also starting to become more concrete and are making more sense to me.Definitely a must read for anyone on a spiritual journey as I am to understand the meaning and essence of life."

Then post-stroke recovery (very fascinating!!). Then basically, how to solve the world. Well, Taylor believes that we control our own thoughts, feelings, and attitudes. She argues that we need to learn and to value ""tending the garden of our minds."" It's a difficult charge, but hey - she rebuilt her entire left brain, so I guess I can try!"

It covers a bit of brain science in an accessible manner, as well as offering a hopeful and optimistic outlook on recovery. She provides valuable information about how to interact with those who have experienced a stroke. It is a bit repetitive at times but was an interesting insight into the adaptability of the human brain. I appreciated the tips on how to quiet our ""inner chatter"" and redirect unwanted neurocircuits."

It is beautifully, intelligently and inspirationally written. I enjoyed it. I would definitely recommend it."

Maybe I'm too immature, or maybe I'm just letting my child like right brain find some joy in the misery my left keeps projecting."

I just saved you reading the book.The chapters on the stroke itself are interesting, but they don’t justify the bulk of the book which consists of her self-aggrandizing recovery tale and her tips for how you can be epic as well."

One of the people who really work for other people and share a real experience to shed light and help. I suggest to watch her TED talk, which is quite impressive as well. One of the most watched talks ever. "
59,1430300612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2375254-darla,5,I listened to audio recording read by JBT. Fantastic book! Awesome insights into the function and plasticity of the brain. Most importantly JBT gives specifics on managing and shaping our thoughts and thereby the way we experience life. I highly recommend.
