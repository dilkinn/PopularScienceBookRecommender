And the chief virtue of a cultural activity--be it art, music, literature, or science--is the way it enriches our lives.""― Lawrence M. Krauss, Fear of Physics: A Guide for the PerplexedOne of my great loves is reading about physics and science. Richard Feynman, Niels Bohr, Newton, Einstein, etc., are my lower-case ""g"" gods. While my math and science background is just enough to get me in trouble, it is also enough to keep me coming back. A couple years ago I decided that I would drop my subscription to 'The Economist' for a year and instead subscribe to 'Science'. Every week I would read. It was like launching myself into an intellectual sphere that got more and more dense toward the center. I would jam easily with THIS WEEK IN SCIENCE and even IN BRIEF, but once I hit RESEARCH ARTICLES and the REPORTS I was usually forced to just dance around the abstract. But I loved it. It was like New York Times crossword puzzles. I found the more often I could finish a Wednesday the more answers I could find without help to the Thursday puzzles. That, I believe is the essence of what Krauss is trying to communicate in this book. Life is a joy. The search for answers is a thrill. Knowing how science works and where science IS deepens our understanding of our brief moment on this round rock in space. I love literature, but often GOOD literature tries to translate truths found in science. Just look at how closely Cormac McCarthy and Thomas Pynchon and Don DeLillo follow the discoveries of science. Knowledge is constantly bleeding between science, philosophy, and art. There is a nobility and a beauty to the search, the discovery, and understanding. If we aren't curious and aren't engaged, we might as well be dead or slaves."
2,0465023673,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1339246-gendou,3,"There are a few gems in this book. Krauss dedicates some time to explaining how scientists (physicists in particular) think. He scratches the surface of why this is successful (and even talks about when it hasn't been as successful).But the title of the book is misleading. This book is mostly anecdote. If you want to be told a bunch of random physics facts, read this book. If you're actually weary of physics, and feel it's beyond your grasp, and best left to the experts, don't read this book. Yet. First, read about this history of science.You see, people need to first learn how we came to know the things we know. Telling science as a story, starting in antiquity, and blossoming into modern speculative cosmological theories. Telling science as a list of facts robs the reader of a good reason to believe any of it.Also, if you're considering the audio form of this book, be warned. It's read by the author. Don't get me wrong. I love to hear Krauss speak. But they apparently recorded this one in ""record time"" and it shows."
3,0465023673,http://goodreads.com/user/show/187209-ian,1,"If the whole point of your book is to explain the complexities of physics to the layman, I would suggest NOT using equations TWO pages into the book (I didn't venture past page two). The problem with physics is that the only people that can understand it are the very same people that are completely unable to translate it into forms that the masses can understand.Dear Nerds,Thank you for space ships and solar power and mass transit, but do you have to be so NERDY all the time?Love,Ian"
4,0465023673,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27195238-menglong-youk,4,"I have read many books similar to this one, and most of the concepts included in this book are familiar to me, but my goodness, by no means that I understand them all. However, there is one important piece that this book spends more time on, and personally, I find this piece needs to be spread more widely. I am afraid that my words might venture into the wrong lane, so I am going to just use the author's.""Scientific truth does not require the expectation that the theories we work with are truly fundamental. In this sense, physics is still clearly guided by the same principles introduced by Galileo 400 years ago and indeed the very same principles I introduced at the beginning and throughout this book. All of our wonderful theories of nature involve approximations that we use with impunity. We are guided by ignoring the irrelevant. What is irrelevant is generally guided by considering the dimensional nature of physical quantities, which determine the scale of the problems we are interested in and those we can safely ignore. All the while we creatively try to adapt what has already worked to new situations. In so doing, we have revealed a remarkable hidden universe that exists beyond our limited human senses, a universe that is thus far simpler and more symmetric. So far, everywhere we look, spherical cows still surround us."""
5,0465023673,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5793994-zachary,4,"Sort of glad to circle back and re-read this decade old gift (Thanks nameless oldest brother!). It holds up really well, and it does a better job at explaining things than I had realized. At least, for the first half of the book. I think it's appropriately chill on the side of the grand theory of everything, although not necessarily for the Kuhnian reasons I want it to acknowledge the power and organizing science of narrative tales. (Though the organizing story of the post nuclear gathering in ny is tongue in cheek enough.)Mostly, this made we wish that my physics teacher at Longview had been even halfway decent as a teacher or a physicist, because this book, especially the first half, makes it exciting and particularly interesting to boil most questions down into ones of magnitude and scale. Very glad for the re read, but I think my sciency heart of interest lies in cosmology rather than quantum weak forces. But I am apparently excited about bovine spheres. Wish I had done my actual science courses at an r2 or r1 school. Alas."
6,0465023673,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51609004-leanne-davis,5,"An excellent guide to what can be a complicated subject. One of the best science communicators around, Lawrence Krauss delivers with a book that is wonderfully informative and humourous. You'll never look at a cow quite the same way again."
7,0465023673,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3391424-rachael,5,"Krauss, a physicist, sets out for the non scientist what it means to do physics. He starts by talking about how physics is essentially a creative act figuring out how to discard as much unessential information as possibly. That launches him into a discussion about some of the basic ideas behind modern physics in relativity and quantum mechanics, and ends with an interesting relfection on what it means for a physics theory to be true. Some theories work on different scales, can there be a theory which works on all scales? Does it matter? I think Krauss does an admirable job of making some rather complex ideas accessible to all. The weakest part of the book was some of his discussion on symmetry which got to be a bit rambly but included some gold nuggets such as his discussion of imaginary time and anti-particles."
8,0465023673,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63408658-karel-alleene,4,"When I got to know the figure of CP Snow and ran across his famous essay 'The two cultures', I realised my knowledge of natural laws was insufficient, not to say completely absent. Still, they make up the fabric of my everyday life - so why didn't I make an effort to try to understand some of those laws?Although It took quite an effort (at times it gave me the same sensation when you're trying to talk in a strange language: you feel like you have lost a considerable amount of your thinking power) and I didn't get it all (not by a long shot) - it still was a rewarding reading experience. For example: when Krauss writes about water being the only material that actually expands when temperatures drop below zero, he took me by surprise. I knew the fact, but I never released the consequences of that simple fact."
9,0465023673,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17781840-sebastian-perez-saaibi,5,"Just when I thought I had forgotten all my Physics undergrad education, this book comes as a refresher to prove the contrary.Physical intuition (and the acquired ability to perform order of magnitude estimates and back-of-the napkin calculations) is more relevant now than ever, as we enter the understanding of complex socio-economic systems.Fantastic book by Lawrence Krauss; I almost wish this book had a live update (to include the Higgs Boson discovery and other more recent developments). What a fascinating read!"
10,0465023673,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32701197-christian,5,"I strongly recommend this book for those who at least have an elementary understanding of physics. If so, this gem will guide you to the next level. Especially recommended for students who've taken Physics in high school and are looking to obtain a BS in Physics this is a great summer read before your freshman year of college. A+++"
11,0465023673,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3049744-daniel-gon-alves,4,"This book is the reason why I love mr.Krauss, one of the best, most engaging and brilliant science educators. A must read for everyone."
12,0465023673,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71340874-tom,1," While there is no doubt as to the depth of Lawrence Krauss' knowledge, this book is everything that it is trying not to be. I challenge anyone who rated this book five stars to now explain their renewed understanding of gauge symmetry, special relativity, or why the universe is flat! If you are an average ignoramus (like me) trying to understand the universe, then this book is not for you. This book is written for university level physics students. After reading this book I've traded my fear of physics for complete despair! Honestly...the author could have written anything and I would have no idea whether it was true or not. I'm left with the feeling that making sense of the universe is reserved for the scientific elite, the chosen ones. Disappointing."
13,0465023673,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6478339-gabriele,4,"Even though I understood almost every word in the book, I didn't understand much apart from the fact that physics is really hard. Can't say I am less perplexed by physics after reading this but it might be a great book for you if you're smart and had some physics in the university. "
14,0465023673,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1450643-amanda,3,"3.5 stars. I loved how this book gave an insight into how physicists think and approach problems. It did, however, feel longer than the 200 pages it was and was somewhat uneven. Definitely something I would need to read more than once to fully digest."
15,0465023673,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19990739-abe,4,"Like most pulp science writing, it meanders, but it's unique theme provides unexpected insights. "
16,0465023673,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7908269-julie,4,"I never took a physics course. I don't know if my comfort with mathematics helped with this book, but it certainly didn't hurt. That said, this was a general introduction to early theories in physics as well as an explanation of the implications of recent experiments on our understanding of the univers. The book also examines how early explanations laid the groundwork for later predictions and theories. In some cases, it describes how early predictions were validated (or invalidated) as the equipment to run more sophisticated tests became available.This book didn't give me enough information for me to pick up a physics book full of formulas, and that's fine. That was not my goal. My goal was to understand some of the basic concepts of physics and to understand the relevance of terms such as ""quark"" and ""neutrino"". On that level, the book succeeded. It also gave me a deep appreciation of all the science that went into my GPS app.If you listen to the audio version, there is an interview with the author at the end. This is worth listening to all the way until the end.Bottom line: Listen to this if you have a strong interest in science but not much background in physics, or if you have a passing interest in science and are willing to forgive yourself for not understanding all of it."
17,0465023673,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42669310-jonathan-gnagy,5,"This book was a fantastic read. I am sure that some topics might be a bit more difficult to follow for someone completely new to the subjects, but I found the book very interesting. Krauss did a phenomenal job bringing difficult to understand scientific topics and comparing them to everyday things that make visualizing them much easier. Anyone that has a... fear of physics... (or even those with a non-scientist's understanding like me) should read this book. You'll come out thinking a lot more like a physicist than you thought possible."
18,0465023673,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2198250-nikki,2,"I'm afraid that after muddling through this book I still have a fear of physics. I appreciated his ""a cow is a circle"" explanation, and I appreciated the math section. But, honestly, the last chapter dealing with conservation and symmetry I did not get at all. I'm sure I would get a lot more out of this book if I read it again, but at this point, I'm unwilling. I guess I assumed by the title that it would be more remedial than it was. "
19,0465023673,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3464950-michelle,3,"Uncle Lawrence tells all the stories he was told as he ""grew up"" in physics. While I can see how the author arranged the book according to what is, to him, a fully coherent and structured narrative, it comes across as disjointed and random. The individual stories, to the novice in high-energy theoretical physics, have no relation to each other, and seem to be tossed in as the author remembered them."
20,0465023673,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7522908-max-skidmore,3,"I enjoyed this book in spite of being kicked in the teeth regarding how much I don't know about modern Physics. I majored in Physics and thought I had a pretty good foundation. Needless to say, things have changed since then and they continue to change at a rapid pace. That said, I loved getting an introduction to some of the new advances. I give it three stars because of my own disconnectedness. The author is great, it's the reader here."
21,0465023673,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65695481-yana-makarevich,5,"It is very important to make it clear that I never was particularly good at physics. I always had a rather complicated relationship with this scientific area. Although I understand it`s an incredibly important and exciting discipline, I preferred to admire it from afar and couldn`t bring myself to explore various books on the subject. This book is one of the fortunate exceptions: I really enjoyed reading it, remembered what I learnt at school, and, of course, got a lot of new information."
22,0465023673,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8296413-jerad,3,I thought this book was something totally not about physics actually. I seem to have mislead myself and was surprised it was less about philosophy. I cannot rate it 0 due to my own cunt rage in getting the book without knowing what it was. I am not a physics person. I don't have time for physics. Nope. 
23,0465023673,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33508993-read-it,1,"I Had a hard time reading this book for some reason. I have read Dr. Krauss research papers and magazine articles and other books, all well written. However this book was somewhat hard to grasp. either way, do not give up on Dr. Krauss, he is one of the best of the best but this book was his not his best. "
24,0465023673,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36834333-mjmiyargmail-com,3,There is nothing wrong with this book - it is fascinating in fact. It's just that my mind is not made for Physics! Somewhere out there someone explains this stuff in a way I can relate to. Will keep looking.
25,0465023673,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3678640-briar,5,This was my first reading of this book but I would strongly recommend this book to someone that would like to know about physics but for some reasons feels they aren't smart enough to understand it. 
26,0465023673,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39364424-eric,4,"An enjoyable look into the thought processes involved in determining what can be excluded or averaged out, and why, when tackling theories of physical process at different scales. And it appears I was correct in physics class to assume that cows are spherical."
27,0465023673,http://goodreads.com/user/show/975272-ace,0,So far I am intrigued...we shall see what happens...will I end up fearing physics?? Will I???
28,0465023673,http://goodreads.com/user/show/291655-kate,3,"I feel a little better about my relationship with physics now than I did before reading this book. I still don't get it as well as I'd like, but at least I learned some new words."
29,0465023673,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2442746-cory,3,Even physics majors can find some of this enlightening.
30,0465023673,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2399138-doug,2,"Not particularly well-written from a lucidity standpoint, not a clear explanation of some concepts and downright confusing in others. Needed to re-red passages often to have it sink in...."

33,0465023673,http://goodreads.com/user/show/734428-stephanie,3,Damn. I still don't get it. I'll keep trying though. How do I fit my 12 foot car in my 9 foot garage? 
34,0465023673,http://goodreads.com/user/show/849891-drew-lackovic,4,I wish I'd have read this in High School. I loved physics in high school but couldn't ever quite figure out how to connect the formulas with the action; this book bridged that gap for me. 
35,0465023673,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43948176-haya-dodokh,5,Thanks to Lawrence M. Krauss Physics started to excites me because apparently there's always something new to learn.
36,0465023673,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10838825-russ,3,It was ok. I just finished and don't really remember much except that clocks run at a different speed in the basement than in the penthouse.

42,0465023673,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28595643-vusale,0,"The book aims at presenting the evolution of physical research and methods, with the particular focus on modern discoveries that changed the mind not only of laymen, but of the physicists themselves. We cannot imagine sometimes what scientists have to do, and even to sacrifice, in order to get to a theory that would better describe the world around them. The evolution and revolutions in physics often require an extraordinary mindset being able to approach new experiments and observations (which sometimes are at odds with the existing theories and world models) from some non-obvious sides. This is what made Einstein a household name. Want to meet the key leaders of the army of physicists beginning from Galileo, as well as their basic theories that made possible some mind blowing predictions? Want to know who are those guys in our world who possibly travel through time and hwo they do it? Want to find a common between a pot of water and a piece of iron? If you're interested in popular science, and in popular physics in particular, this book is a must read.I personally enjoyed this read, although it was not at all easy. I was forced to reread paragraphs and even pages from time to time to get the better understanding of principal ideas (I think mostly it was the problem of translation). So here's the paradox: some ideas might seem a bit too complicated for the beginner's mind, but the figures, discoveries and examples are quite fundamental and most of them cannot be unfamiliar to the one with a set of main popular physics books under their belt.Neertheless, the book is worth taking a peek (an attentive, deeply concentrated peek). You'll definitely find something to blow your mind and enlarge your worldview with."
