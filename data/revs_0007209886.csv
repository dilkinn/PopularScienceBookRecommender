0,0007209886,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3978225-carol,5,"This book is fabulous, and I tried to do it justice by researching and linking some pictures from the Natural History Museum. But I can't be bothered to fuss with GR's system and annotating my references.Blog review with pictures: https://clsiewert.wordpress.com/2015/...Text review:Fortey had me hooked with the idea of the behind-the-scenes maze at the British Museum. There’s something about that that appeals to me; not only knowing the stories, but the physicality of the space. In my first few years working at the hospital, I used to delight in knowing the back stairwells and unused corridors one could take to get from one decade of the building to another. How could a building like this not be filled with hidden mysteries?Inside the Spirit Collection, Natural History Museum http://www.nhm.ac.uk/visit-us/whats-o...“Tucked away, mostly out of view, there is a warren of corridors, obsolete galleries, offices, libraries and above all, collections. This is the natural habitat of the curator.“It is a historical tour of the museum, staff and taxonomy by a knowledgeable, urbane, humorous guide. Fortey was hired as a Junior Researcher (specializing in trilobites, as one does) in 1970 and has been there ever since–even past his retirement in 2006. He is clearly a wit, apparent most often in the early chapters. In one anecdote, he shares his reaction to timekeeping requirements:“The diary was a hangover from the early days of the Museum, being a little book into which the employee was supposed to write his activities, morning and afternoon, and which was collected every month and signed off by the head of the department… I took to writing “study trilobites” on the first day of the month and ditto marks for the rest of it.”I devoured the first part of this book. I meant to read just a chapter before bed, a way of lulling my brain into imaginative sleepiness without catching me up into murders and anti-heroes, but Fortey’s enthusiasm engaged me. He clearly loves taxonomy and biology, and has a deep respect for the research process. Although he is generally apolitical, he does occasionally allow himself commentary on problematic aspects of the history of museums, the history of science and politics influencing research. He shares minor scandals about researchers, stories of discoveries, and anecdotes about the space inside the museum. In many ways, much of it is about the history of science and of taxonomy as much as a museum.“Science is often like this: an idea has been around for a while before new evidence suddenly pushes it forwards. And then researchers start to think: maybe this example is not so surprising after all.”From the herb collection in the Botany Department http://www.nhm.ac.uk/research-curatio...I confess, like a number of enthusiasts who’ve illegally sampled collections, I felt a little bit of atavistic greed when he talked about the Herbarium. I probably shouldn’t be allowed in there.I stumbled at the section on bugs. I just could not read it before bed, no matter how engaging the story, particularly when he mentions their connection to forensics. Sill, I regained my footing as he continued with typical humor. The mineralogy section is perhaps the least engaging for both of us, though he does his best to liven it up with stories about gems and meteorites. There’s a nod to modern equipment and the machines in this section, which was the only place I skimmed–about 3 pages in total–because of the specificity and complexity of material. For the rest of it, Fortey deftly explains in a way that anyone can understand.There’s something supremely eerie about the idea we can catalog life by reducing it to it’s essential, whether through description of DNA or through the “type” specimens, the first and ideal type of a thing described. I remember the first time I opened a drawer at my college’s biology department and saw specimen upon specimen of dead bird.Diptera collection, from Natural History Museum http://www.nhm.ac.uk/research-curatio...To be fair, I think Fortey understands life can’t be conceptualized down to its representation:“Modern methods of characterizing species employ molecular sequencing to identify a characteristic part of the DNA… But this process leaves out everything else. Every species has its own tale, a story about how it earns its living , meets its mate or warns off its enemies: the interesting stuff. You don’t understand London just by reading the names in the telephone directory.”The summary looks back at some of the influencers, for better or for worse, and includes a mention of significant female researchers while noting the sexism of the system. He finalizes with a bit of a lament about the requirements of funding and its effect on ‘pure’ research. However, there’s a note of hope–the very fact that so much information is available by way of the internet and through collaborations, we might once again see the rise of the amateur enthusiast contributing to the knowledge base. Overall, a fascinating and entertaining look through the corridors and boxes in one man’s memories in the British Natural History Museum, as well as the future of taxonomy.“I could not suppress the thought that the storeroom was like the inside of my head, presenting a physical analogy for the jumbled lumber room of memory… This book opens a few cupboards, sifts through a few drawers. A life accumulates a collection: of people, work and perplexities. We are all our own curators.”"
1,0007209886,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10592271-brokentune,4,"Dry Store Room No. 1 was a kind of miscellaneous repository, a place of institutional amnesia. It was rumoured that it was also the site of trysts, although love in the shadow of the sunfish must have been needy rather than romantic. Certainly, it was a place unlikely to be disturbed until it was dismantled. I could not suppress the thought that the store room was like the inside of my head, presenting a physical analogy for the jumbled lumber-room of memory. Not everything there was entirely respectable; but, even if tucked out of sight like suppressed memories, these collections could never be thrown away. This book opens a few cupboards, sifts through a few drawers. A life accumulates a collection: of people, work and perplexities. We are all our own curators.Before you get any ideas, this book is not just about the one storeroom. And while the book is focused on London's Natural History Museum - its history, people, and exhibits - Dr. Fortey tells of much more than just the museum, he just happens to use the museum as an anchor for his discourse into the history (naturally!) of the world and the people and finds that have shaped our understanding of it. And what an anchor it is! The Natural History Museum started out as a part of the British Museum (another favourite haunt of mine), but the collection of natural artefacts soon outgrew the capacity of the British Museum and efforts led by Richard Owen succeeded in the split of the collections and the establishment of the Natural History Museum as a separate enterprise and an important new centre of research - which it is to this day.  Dr. Fortey goes into a lot of detail about the history of the museum and its collections, and in turn this reveals a wider story of the development of the natural sciences in society.  Fortey's forte, however, is when he gets to speak about the different collections and the people who have shaped not only the departments of the museum but also the scientific research - from lichen, to minerals, to worms. I had no idea, I could be so interested in worms! My first concrete interest in the NHM's collections was when I read about Mary Anning's groundbreaking finds of ichthyosaurus and plesiosaurus specimen which are held by the NHM.Anning's finds are, of course, some of the famous exhibits, along with the archaeopteryx, or the dodo skeleton. While Fortey mentions them, he also introduces the collections that are not on display and that are mostly of interest to the scientific community. He does it in a way, tho, that is strangely fascinating. And while not all parts of the book are equally interesting, and while Fortey's tangents sometimes strayed off into the finer points of plant classification, I loved his message, or rather messages, which drive home the importance of the Natural History Museum and the scientific research conducted there: Science, treasure, rarity, beauty, scholarship: this hidden gallery made me understand again the heterogeneous attraction of Museum life. Nowhere else could a link with the Mughal emperors be relevant to what happens deep beneath the surface of the Earth; nowhere else would the fanatical collecting of a toffish Russell become a long-term resource for mineral genesis; nowhere else could rummaging in an attic reveal an archive of the Prince Regent. From the Russell Room I looked out on to the Victoria and Albert Museum across the other side of Exhibition Road. The prospect might suggest imperial nonsense and ‘pomp and circumstance’, a slightly ridiculous inheritance from the nineteenth century when the Sun never set on the British Empire. But South Kensington has become transformed by time and usage into something that is more than just the ‘BM’ and the ‘V& A’, a monument to a Britain that no longer exists. The collections are there to inform and inspire the whole world, and not just a small corner of it. I am not much of a post-colonialist, and I don’t necessarily admire the principles on which the collections were made. But I do understand the primacy of collections as a record of the world, both human and natural. There is more to collections than the golden rule about never throwing things away. There is inherent value in having people who ‘know their stuff’. The apparently esoteric can suddenly illuminate unsuspected areas of knowledge. Those who have devoted their lives to collections – obdurate people, odd people, admirable people – actually make a museum what it is and should be."
2,0007209886,http://goodreads.com/user/show/113627-joyce,0,"This hilarious memoir makes the case that British eccentrics, particularly of the scientific variety, are an endangered species due to rapid habitat loss. The author spent his entire career as the ""trilobite man"" at the Natural History Museum in London -- in the Department of Palaeontology, reachable by a door hidden behind a skeleton of a giant sloth in the public gallery, of course -- and he is a gleeful guide to everything that will be lost in a world where research and particularly taxonomy are no longer considered sexy commodities.Speaking of which, Fortey is surprisingly open about the love lives, mental disorders, and substance abuse problems of his colleagues -- the title refers to a noted trysting spot in the Museum -- and even seems rather disappointed by the notoriously clean-living minerologists. But in my opinion his best anecdotes are the ones directly related to research: how Linneaus's notebooks almost touched off a war, why mycologists tend to be watercolorists, numerous examples of scientists coming to resemble their objects of study (touchingly, the mollusc people work in a cozy ""oyster bed"" in the basement), stories of demi-official collecting expeditions like the one organized in the early 1970's by 4 young entomologists (who all looked like members of Fleetwood Mac) for £3,000.Fortey employs a charmingly old-fashioned turn of phrase, sometimes to a baffling extent, as when he refers to fossil shells ""shaped like the wafers that hold scoops of ice cream"" (uh... you mean ice cream CONES??). I particularly love it when he busts out with some dotty aside like ""It has been one of my life's unfulfilled ambitions to eat the giant mushroom Termitomyces that grows deep inside the termite mounds in Africa""; or ""they glide over the forest floor feeding on decaying vegetation: a slime mould in this stage of its life is like a patch of living snot"". Boundless affection for nature's works -- especially animals, slightly less for plants and a rather stiff relationship with rocks -- is exuded from every chapter.Lest you get the impression that this memoir is merely an academic gossipfest, let me note how deeply the author understands and makes the case for scientific research and particularly the unending minutiae of taxonomy. Even those of us who read a lot of popular science books are probably incapable of explaining so clearly the actual processes by which species are collected, prepared, described, named, verified, accepted, stored, and sometimes reclassified. Still less could we describe the pros and cons of the major taxonomic methods in play today. Fortey can and does, grounding his anecdotes in the day-to-day work of the palaeontologist, zoologist, and botanist.The scientific method is not a pretty thing practiced by angelic gentlemen in this author's view -- at one point he notes, ""It might actually be the case that having an obstructive, disagreeable, temperamental, competitive or even downright anarchic group of people all scrapping and competing is the best way to push knowledge forwards."" -- but his lively account gives you a sense of what the world will lose when market-driven, value-added, customer-focused museums entirely take over the natural homes of those few obsessives who can recognize thousands of midges, butterflies, fungi, or trilobites as easily as most people can recognize the faces on Facebook."
3,0007209886,http://goodreads.com/user/show/369112-melody,3,"Wildly discursive, endlessly fascinating look behind the scenes of the Natural History museum in London. Fortey is a scientist's scientist, a naturalist's naturalist- he's compelled to explain some mind-numbing minutia along the way to imparting interesting facts. Some of his pedantic asides made me laugh out loud because they were such textbook nerd moments. There's a lot of detail here, more even than I wanted, but the narrative is terribly interesting. If you like that sort of thing, and I do."
4,0007209886,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9246169-wanda,5,"I adore Richard Fortey's writing. His sense of humour matches mine extremely well and I appreciate the literariness of his style. Having worked in libraries and, currently, at a museum, I know how much of the action takes place out of public view. Fortey lets us spy on the secret life of the museum and the museum curators. Its a fascinating world and highly entertaining.An extremely good read."
5,0007209886,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,4,"A lot of reviews comment on how dry they found this book, but I rather enjoyed it. I like Richard Fortey's style of writing, despite his tendency to ramble and get distracted. It's more of a biography or history of the Natural History Museum than a chronicle of the science that goes on there, but there's some of that, too.I liked the sense of exploring a wonderland -- Fortey plainly finds everything in the Natural History Museum a delight and a revelation, and I shared in that. He got in some apt comparisons, too, like comparing the museum's storage to Gormenghast.I was vaguely aware of most of the broader details here about trends in collecting and displaying, but most of the details about the actual scientists and curators were completely new to me. This book has a distinctly gossip-like feeling, which I didn't mind at all. "
6,0007209886,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16050976-sara-dovre-wudali,3,"You know how sometimes you get stuck in a conversation with someone who tells you a story about people you don't know and don't care about in excruciating detail? And then just when you are thinking, OK, the next time he takes a breath I'm going to interject and say I have an appointment I really must leave for, pleasure chatting with you? And then right before he breathes, he says something utterly fascinating and you decide it's worth sticking around to hear the rest of that story? And then that little 5-minute tidbit passes and you've lost your chance for escape? This whole book was like that--20 minutes of 2-star alternating with 5 minutes of 5-star. Just when I thought, OK, I'm putting this down at the end of this chapter for sure, he'd reel me right back in."
7,0007209886,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7836631-doc-kinne,4,"Fortey is not only a reasonable writer in that he can tell a good story, he also has some important things to say gleaned from his whole career and the British Natural History Museum. He uses this book to say those things, but doesn't quite fall into the preachy area.While Fortey's line of work is arthropod paleontology, he roams and roves through the Museum as a whole, including plants, minerals, and fungi. Much of the book is telling about his co-workers over the years, and he includes the great work they've done, some of the gaffes that have happened, and other various stories. Fortey just touches on the Museum's Directors taking the stance that the real important work is done by - amazing, this - the workers.The ending quarter of the book, in some ways, is taken up with an interesting personal overview of how the British Museum has changed over his career. It has moved from the scientists being the most important elements to the marketers and PR people. It has moved from having people available to study their subjects in absolute depth - and he gives stories about the good that can happen for all of us when people are allowed to do that - to people being let go and not replaced because the bean counters don't see what they're doing as worth anything. Fortey stops short of really decrying this situation. I won't.Through it all, one thing is clear: Fortey thought the world of the mission of the Museum and its scientific workers. He notes that many of the scientists still work at the Museum gratis after their official retirement because they love the work, and its not done yet.Would that we all worked in such places and with such people."
8,0007209886,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5286233-j-p,4,"Lest you think a museum is a stuffy old building filled with the same antiquated exhibits, here's a book that provides an enlightening look behind the scenes at one of the biggest museums in England.The amount of material stored in the Natural History Museum is staggering. Literally miles (not to mention kilometers) of all sorts of objects from creepy crawlies found only in a remote part of South America to minerals from right around the corner by comparison. I had no idea the museum employed such an array of specialists. For every family of bug there's a person who has made it their main field of study.Among the employees are the eccentric old gents who thrive in this sort of environment. From the guy who kept and filed by length all the pieces of string ever sent to the museum as packaging to the bloke who tried on his bulky diving apparatus and then couldn't remove it so he walked out of the museum looking like as the author put it ""an extra in a science fiction movie"" there are certainly a varied assortment of people working out of the public view.Highly recommended for anyone interested in science or those who enjoy a trip to a museum."
9,0007209886,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5586131-melora,4,"This is really quite a bit more interesting than the title might suggest! A few of the sections dragged (""Noah's Ark in Kensington"" and ""Behind the Galleries,"" particularly), but mostly Fortey's descriptions of plants, animals, and fossils, and of the men and women who study them, are pretty entertaining. He does tend to get a bit gossipy for me -- I might enjoy his science writing, Without the focus on the institutional politics, even more -- but that might just reflect my total ignorance about the scientists and politicians he is talking about. I now know a little more about trilobites, lichens, screw worms, corpse decay, etc. than I did previously, and Fortey managed to make all these things seem fun!"
10,0007209886,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15364318-katherine-kreuter,3,"I had been meaning to read this one for a while, then stumbled upon it in the library. It's a quirky personal history of the Natural History Museum, written by one of its long-serving boffins. This particular boffin is into his trilobites, but he has an outgoing character and wide-ranging curiosity so he can talk competently about biology or geology or any other -ology. There's a lot of good science here, and I have new respect for those who devote their lives to a particular species in the belief that their painstaking efforts will be of use to future scientists. There's also a lot about how technology has changed the pursuit of knowledge in these many fields, which is also fascinating in its way. But it's the human stories that I will remember best. Such as the way so many of these scientists come to resemble their subjects, e.g. the 'bee man' of corpulent shape, striped sweater, humming his way down the steps to Cromwell Road. And there are many other lovely anecdotes, not least the fact that many romantic assignations between staff took place in that very 'Dry Store Room No. 1'. No wonder he hummed."
11,0007209886,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6192327-tory-wagner,5,"Dry Storeroom No. 1: The Secret Life of the Natural History Museum by Richard Fortey is a real gem for all those who value the pursuit of science. Fortey, a natural scientist who worked for the Museum, shares his wisdom and experiences garnered through a long and successful career. His dry wit makes for an easy and enjoyable read, but the message of the need for continued support for the sciences is not lost on the reader. His writing is both poetic and a call to arms for the continued support for all scientific research, no matter how obscure, so that we don't lose pieces of our scientific history. "
12,0007209886,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18236731-roxanne,3,"When I read the spine, I immediately knew that I needed to read it. Museums and secrets? All right, I am down with that. It was told from an evolutionary perspective and it was like having a conversation right there in the room. Coming from a creationist background, I thought this was interesting to read through. Fortey talked about scholars and scientists that contributed to the world of science and history and preserving the world's catalogue of life. Others would perhaps find this a bit dry. I didn't really agree with the closing quote but that is an opinion. I genuinely liked the book's style of writing even though I did not agree with it 100%."
13,0007209886,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91446276-frans-robyns,4,"A highly entertaining read from an excellent and thoroughly readable science writer. Fortey provides a whistle-stop, yet unhurried tour of the magic that goes on behind-the-scenes at the Natural History Museum. Both the enigmatic charms of specimens soaked in alcohol brought back to the museum by illustrious figures such as Joseph Banks and Charles Darwin, and the incredible work done by the current crop of scientists at the museum who work tirelessly to ever expand the outer-field of human knowledge and wisdom are laid bare in an informative but highly descriptive and often intensely funny manner. Highly recommended for those with a particular interest in the Natural History Museum or simply those with a general interest in science and natural history."
14,0007209886,http://goodreads.com/user/show/92397-brittany,5,"This book is like Beauty and the Beast. Let me explain.Beauty and the Beast is my very favorite fairy tale. I will read adaptations of that story all day long, and well into the night. My favorite part of any version is when Beauty explores the castle. She's alone, and it's quiet, and she's wandering through room upon room of wonders and marvels. Beauty's sense of of awe, discovery, and curiosity perfectly mirrors Fortey's experience wandering through the hallways, storerooms, basements, and attic of London's Natural History Museum. It's as if Beauty gave up on that whole fall-in-love-and-find-a-prince scenario and took up curatorial and archival duties in the castle. It is wonderful. Fortey spent years as a trilobite curator at the museum, so he is in prime position to recount the wonders housed there, the politics of the museum, and the changing trends of the establishment. He discusses how new technology, including genetic sequencing and tagging, have changed the way museum scientists do science. He talks about how changing funding structures pushed museums from being strictly research institutions to being centers of public learning. At times, he comes across as a bit of a curmudgeon, tut-tutting at those kids in the white coats with their gene sequencers, but in the end he recognizes their importance, though does stress the often-forgotten value in a specialist in one taxon or another. He does go on to explore the burgeoning role of the citizen scientist, but this is all information that will be familiar with anyone up on these branches of biology. He has some good things to say about the evolving roles of museum and science, but nothing earthshaking or very novel. The wonderful value in this book, and what makes it such a treasure, are the treasures of the museum themselves. The twisting, hidden architecture of the museum, and the surprises it contains. These gems, set off by Fortey's engaging, amusing, and personable narration, make this an extremely pleasurable book."
15,0007209886,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17588869-vilhelmiina,3,"Quite a marathon of a read. It’s very thorough, detailed and meticulous in telling the story of the Natural History Museum, and there were some great anecdotes about all sorts of people and happenings. "
16,0007209886,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14633278-shonna-froebel,4,"This book is a personal exploration of the the work going on at the Natural History Museum in London, and the people doing that work. Fortey worked at the Museum for decades, specializing in trilobites. The book tells a little of his own history, but also looks at the various departments contained within the Museum, from his initial wanderings as a young scientist there to those projects that caught his interest over the years. He looks at how these projects relate to the larger world, and how the current funding model may not meet the real needs of science going forward, particularly in light of the environmental challenges our world is now facing.Fortey begins with an initial look at the vast network of rooms, offices, labs, and storage areas behind the public galleries, continues with a chapter explaining taxonomy, the naming of names, and how this is the underlying language that connects scientists work around the world and across time.He then looks at the traditional world of natural science and how that has changed over time.The next four chapters look at particular departments within the museum, and at a selection of the projects and personalities that have caught Fortey's interest. These include animals (both current and fossilized), plants (again, both current and fossilized), insects (the largest area of species and in many ways the most challenging), and geology (how rocks can tell us history, evolution, migration, and other stories about our world). The next chapter brings all of these together, and shows where the Museum is now in terms of research and priorities.The last chapter is a call to all of us to recognize how important this work is to our world, our future, and our continuing existence.A personal, yet highly enlightening look at the world of natural science, with its diversity, range of studies, and the people that dedicate their lives to it."
17,0007209886,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16212834-hannah-givens,3,"A charming, rambling fusion of memoir/anecdote and scientific explanation. You get the feeling of working in the Natural History Museum, with all its own idiosyncrasy and history, but you also get a tour of the taxonomic work being done there. I'm not much for natural history museums, all those dead things freak me out, and so I wasn't aware how scientific it is in the background. The miles and miles of specimens used to delineate species and study biological or geological history. It's really fascinating and valuable, which is perhaps Fortey's main thesis. I must say I also appreciate his view on progress -- a certain nostalgia, but also an appreciation of faster, more-accurate, newer techniques. There's some regret for the fall of the experts who could get away with anything because they knew everything, and I share the nostalgia... But he also appreciates that we're entering a new age of the amateur, and that's not a bad thing. In the past, it was upper-class amateurs who did scientific work. Now it will be a vast host of amateurs from all classes and all around the world, because the internet makes that possible. There's a hint of the old world here, but Fortey is aware of yesteryear's social problems, including imperialism and sexism. His asides on the great female taxonomists, often mistreated by their peers, were some of my favorite parts. Those, and the occasional discussions of how all the back-room science translates into the public exhibits."
18,0007209886,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2752391-sarai,5,"I really enjoyed this book, the balance of information and humour was perfect in keeping my full attention; with other non-fiction books they can become a chore to get through at times but Fortey's humour pushed it along nicely and I am definitely a fan of the way he writes. Once picked up it was hard to put down but also very easy to get back into when picked up again after a break. Fortey takes us into the secretive world of the museum, to get to know the cogs of the machine, without which the museum would not exist. I loved reading about the eccentric, passionate researchers, their area of research and other interests and at times their scandalous lives inside and outside of the museum as well as the changes within the museum over the years. The layout of the book is great meaning if you have a particular interest you could open the book at that chapter or return to at a later date, I know I will be, It covered things I already know and things I did not and now would like to look into further. Also Fortey's constant comparisons of the museum building in South Kensington to the castle from Mervyn Peake's books of Gormanghast makes me want to read those soon.A very enjoyable read, informative, amusing and inspiring. "
19,0007209886,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2251741-kelly,4,"It took me many months to read this book which might make it seem that I didn't enjoy it. However, that's not the case. I especially loved the early chapters in this book which give you a walk through, behind-the-scenes look at London's Natural History Museum. It took me so long to finish it because I lack the discipline to push through non-fiction. Stories propel me forward and compel me to keep reading...even good non-fiction just doesn't do that for me. This book includes scientific information about the collection, categorizing, and obsessing over animals, rocks, shells, insects, etc as well as often very funny stories about the scientists who study them.I love museums, particularly Natural History museums and so I enjoyed this book very much. I did disagree with the author's assumption of evolution as THE ONLY WAY and (as a friend who read this stated) his inability to distinguish between evolution within a species as opposed to evolution from one species to another. I still don't buy that I evolved from a fish."
20,0007209886,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1008236-bookmarks-magazine,0,"""The Natural History Museum is, first and foremost, a celebration of what time has done to life,"" writes Fortey, whose engaging book similarly commemorates the vast record of life on Earth. As he meanders through the halls of the museum's back rooms, Fortey proves to be an excellent, witty guide to the scientists and specimens that give testament to this history. Far from being a dry read, Dry Storeroom No. 1 weaves together colorful anecdotes about the scientists, their research, and the value of museums, defending evolution while admitting how much we still don't know about the Earth's species (starting with beetles, for example). A few critics pointed out that Fortey errs on the side of including too much information, but most readers will embrace his guide to, well, everything having to do with life.This is an excerpt from a review published in Bookmarks magazine."
21,0007209886,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2148089-amber,4,"This book is heavy on Taxonomy and how the museum preserves and stores specimens. It is interesting because there are so many different branches of study in natural science. The men and women who do it are true scientist and academics as well as historians. They study and preserve plant and animal species that may become extinct due to man's bad habits. Also, the study of various organisms that the museum researches may one day relieve some of the maladies of underdeveloped nations and those who live in extreme poverty and malnourishment. This book also had a great history of the museum and its leaders. Interesting hierarchy and culture to work in. "
22,0007209886,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1938840-carrie,4,"This is a delightfully enthusiastic book, most interesting for anyone who has ever visited the museum in question (and anyone who hasn't). It includes some fascinating pictures. And the design of the book is pleasing. The author has a wonderfully intimate manner, and paints almost Dickensian-ly vivid pictures of his colleagues, past and present. Consequently, the book has a convivial, chatty feel. Delightful."
23,0007209886,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2211103-jesse,1,"I bought this book, excited by the idea of a 'behind-the-scenes' look at the Natural History Museum(s). Instead, I stopped reading halfway through, as this was only a behind-the-scenes account in that it was entirely made up of anecdotes by Fortey about his time at the museum. No real science. No real info. This book should be classed as a biography or memoir."

27,0007209886,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5399361-kam,5,"I love museums. When I went to Europe after I graduated university, one of the top three things I was looking forward to was getting to visit some of the most famous museums in the world. Unfortunately, things didn’t quite go as well as I hoped they would. Sometimes a museum would be closed on the day I wanted to visit; sometimes schedules for other activities would clash with my own plans and I would have to give way; and on other times I was simply too tired (or sick) to be able to enjoy the visit. In the end, I didn’t get to visit all the museums I wanted to go to, and I still feel a minor pang of regret over that. One of the museums I had really wanted to go to was the Natural History Museum in London. When the trip was still in its planning stages, I’d allotted one day for the British Museum and the Natural History Museum - sensible, in my opinion, because they were so large. Sadly I didn’t get to visit either, because by that point in the trip I was just too tired to really enjoy the idea of exploring either museum. It’s because of this lost opportunity that I decided to pick up Richard Fortey’s Dry Store Room No. 1: The Secret Life of the Natural History Museum. I might not have gotten the chance to see the Museum myself, but here was a book that would tell me all about it; even better, it would tell me about what went on behind the scenes, in the places where visitors are not allowed to go. Dry Store Room No. 1 is in many ways what it says on the tin: a behind-the-scenes tour of the Natural History Museum, in the company of Richard Fortey, who worked there as the resident “trilobite man”. He describes the Museum (both literally and figuratively) thusly:It was a place like Mervyn Peake’s rambling palace of Gormenghast, labyrinthine and almost endless, where some forgotten specialist might be secreted in a room so hard to find that his very existence might be called into question. I felt that somebody might go quietly mad in a distant compartment and never be called to account. I was to discover that this was no less than the truth.Fortunately, the reader need not navigate the labyrinth on their own. Through the course of nine chapters, Fortey shows the reader around through the many hallways, rooms, cubbyholes, and unexpected hidden spaces that are not open to the visiting public, telling stories along the way. Many of those stories are, in fact, institutional history: part of the Museum’s own story through time. However, there are also plenty of stories that might be too scurrilous to count as part of something as venerable as “institutional history”: the rumours, the gossip, the “juicy bits” that so often get tastefully elided from more official accounts - or, if included, are told in a very dry, unentertaining manner. Take, for example, the tale he tells about Carl Linnaeus’ herbarium sheets, and why they are in England, and not in Linnaeus’ native Sweden:The collection fetched up in London because Sir James Edward Smith bought it from Linnaeus widow for the sum of £1,050 in 1783. He certainly got a bargain, regardless of those tedious calculations that tell you much that money would be worth today; for he had purchased something timeless. Because of inefficiency or indecision the Swedish government did not make up its mind quickly enough to purchase the collection of its most famous scientific son and Smith stepped in. The Swedes realised their mistake and dispatched a man ‘o war to try and overtake the collection as it sailed on its way to England. Fortunately for the Linnean Society, the collection got away. I doubt whether an herbarium has ever before or since been the object of a diplomatic incident.Fortey’s stories also include tales of the kind of humour that might not be obvious to laypeople, but which are regularly played within the scientific community - particularly in taxonomy:Humour is a delicate matter in nomenclature. The clam genus Abra is crying out to be married with the species name cadabra; and so it was in a species named by Eames and Wilkins in 1957; Abra cadabra, a very satisfactory touch of humour. However, a subsequent authority decided that the species cadabra did not, after all, belong in Abra - so it was moved to another genus, Theora, and there is nothing very entertaining about Theora cadabra. …Almost as good a pun as the Abra example is one of the numerous carabid beetles…Agra phobia. But my favourite remains the plant bugs described by one G. W. Kirkaldy in 1994. These genera all had the Greek suffix -chisme, pronounced ‘kiss me’. Kirkaldy managed to celebrate all the female objects of his affection by adding the appropriate prefix: Polychisme, Marichisme, Dollichisme and so on (there were rather a lot of them, apparently).And then there are the people. Some of the stories Fortey tells are of people whom he knew or knows personally, while others were passed on to him by his own colleagues and friends. A few are practically “urban legends”: stories that are not entirely verifiable but are passed around anyway, like tales around a campfire (stories of sexual peccadilloes, in particular). Throughout all of this, whatever sort of story he is telling, Fortey does so in a light, entertaining manner, his tone rather reminiscent of a grandfather telling stories to his favourite grandchildren. Even his humour is gentle, though there is no way one can miss the dry undertone underlying it, particularly when he thinks the subject matter deserves the sarcasm:I understand that there is now a Creation Museum in Kentucky. Its own creators doubtless regard it as a ‘balance’ to all those pesky 'evolutionary’ museums. It is interesting that the embodiment of respectability for an idea is still a museum, as if a Museum of Falsehoods were a theoretical impossibility. I look forward to a Museum of the Flat Earth, as a counterbalance to all those oblate spheroid enthusiasts.But Fortey’s goal is not simply to share the history and workaday gossip of the Museum. Threaded throughout the entire book is Fortey’s defence of the natural history museum - note the small caps, for he is not simply talking about his own Museum, but of all natural history museums and other similar institutions all around the world. He establishes this in the first chapter, with this excerpt:The Natural History Museum is, first and foremost, a celebration of what time has done to life. If the world is to remain in ecological balance, there is a pressing need to know about all the organisms that collaborate to spin the web of life. The planet’s very survival might depend upon such knowledge.Though he has used the capitalised “Natural History Museum” in his statement to refer to his own institution, he makes clear throughout the rest of the book that the same statement applies to all natural history museums anywhere in the world, big or small, venerably old or brand-spanking new. All natural history museums are, in one way or another, participants in the great work of biological systematics: basically, identifying and naming all species on Earth, and then sorting them out into their proper place in the great Tree of Life (which, incidentally, is also the name of the online project with the same goal). The importance of this cannot be underestimated, especially where it relates to conservation. Fortey explains why in the following excerpt:Every species on Earth has a biography and each one is fascinating in its own way. There may be biologies in the deep sea about which we know nothing. Some of them may be useful to mankind in medicine, or in dealing with extreme conditions as we begin to stretch our metaphorical legs to climb to the stars. Who knows? If we allow species to disappear before they have a chance to tell us about themselves it will be a tragedy to add to the many that our species has already inflicted on the world.But for all that he extols the virtues of the natural history museum, Fortey does express worry about how things are being run. He is, he admits, a member of the old guard, and remembers a time when it was possible to be an eccentric and still generate notable work. This is not a privilege available to younger scientists, as he decries (in his own, gentle way) the “publish or perish” climate so prevalent in research:Nowadays, it is publish or perish, Nature red in tooth and claw, unnatural selection–and, to the winner, the spoils. The description of a scientist, no matter how brilliant, as a ‘non-producer’ is a very effective way of blocking his or her promotion. The result is that too many papers are published and many scientists are so busy keeping ahead of their rivals that they don’t even have time to read what other workers write.He also worries elsewhere in the book that the pressure to make money - a result of businesspeople running museums, not scientists - is limiting the kind of research that can be done in. If a project does not show potential for a profit margin within two or three years, then it will not likely receive funding. Fortey opines that, while not all projects can show profitability immediately (or even at all), research must still be done: on one hand, it is impossible to predict the value of any piece of research until something comes up in the near or far future to prove it so; on the other hand, with human-driven climate change altering ecosystems all around the world, all scientists are under immense time pressure to understand the world as it is now, before it is irrevocably changed. If these scientists are unable to do their research because of short-term financial concerns, Fortey fears that some important aspect about the world will go unrecognised, with unknown repercussions in the future. Still, not all things about the future are negative. He is particularly positive about the Internet as a tool for sharing knowledge amongst not just scientists, but amongst laypeople as well:[The internet] takes the scientist out of his turreted redoubt in one of the remote corners of Gormenghast and places him or her at the disposal all interested parties around the world. It passes on expertise acquired through hours of burrowing through obscure tomes so that anyone can use it. This is a kind of democracy of learning, a generous gift from the cognoscenti to those who wish to learn.The above excerpt might read as slightly condescending, particularly in the last part, but there is truth to what Fortey says about the Internet closing the gap between professional and amateur scientists, and between them and the average person on the street, whose interest in science may be only marginal, but which must be nurtured if humanity is to keep on moving forward towards a better future.Overall, Dry Store Room No. 1: The Secret Life of the Natural History Museum is sure to charm any fan of the Natural History Museum in London, or of natural history museums anywhere in the world, or even of museums in general, but Fortey does more than just let the reader into the backstage world of his workplace. He also tackles the value of a natural history museum, its place in the greater pursuit of truth through science, and its importance not just for preserving the past, but for learning about what lies ahead in the future. With climate change an ever more pressing concern, the work done in natural history museums all around the world is even more important - and this book shows just how important that work is, even if it does not always seem obvious at first.

28,0007209886,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20041887-mary-warnement,4,"Reading this memoir was like chatting with a recently retired curator I know, so perhaps I've transferred some of my affection for my friend to this author. This seemed to take a long time to read. I set it aside to read Babylon Berlin in time for an author talk, and the last 10 pages took me the last 3 days to read. I started a new subway book on Friday because 10 pages were not enough and I've fallen asleep too fast these past nights. That is no reflection of how much I enjoyed Fortey's memoir and tell-all. He shares stories, many that people would no doubt rather not have in print, but he does so without malice (and usually only about those not alive to be offended). He started at the Natural History Museum in 1980 and this book was published in 2008. He makes clear he's not writing an institutional history like Wm Stearns already did.5. The NHM is--or was--a systematic rather than thematic set of displays.His opening chapter sets out the importance of naming to science. That collections must be known to be studied, and therefore consistency and standards are crucial--although no longer ""sexy"" in the scientific world of competitive grants.1. ""All our lives are collections curated through memory.""p. 28-29 He explains Dry Store Room No. 1, both what it was in the Natural History Museum (South Kensington) and what it serves as in his memoir, ""a kind of miscellaneous repository, a place of institutional amnesia...rumoured...site of trysts."" Throughout his book he mentions curating, collecting, and keeping and he means both stuff and people; institutional and personal relationships.29 ""A life accumulates a collection: of people, work and perplexities. We are all our own curators."" 175 ""We need to know what there is in the world for us to look after, regardless of its potential use.""He has some wonderful phrases: 25 ""pickled in perpetuity"" ""washed out parade of the panoply of lie""316 ""welter of nomenclatural chaos""291 Parkinson's Law : ""Work expands to fill the time available for its completion."" [too true]253 He clearly values a sense of humor, even relating to important work, and his anecdotes bear out that he's usually in good company; however, when the museum had to close an exhibition of diamonds earlier than planned because of threat of theft, he wrote that the guards had no sense of humor about jokes.259 He returns to discuss stuff vs people: ""I am not much of a post-colonialist, and I don't necessarily admire the principles on which the collections were made. But I do understand the primacy of collections as a record of the world, both human and natural. There is more to collections than the golden rule about never throwing things away. There is inherent value in having people who 'know their stuff.' The apparently esoteric can suddenly illuminate unsuspected areas of knowledge. Those who have devoted their lives to collections--obdurate people, odd people, admirable people--actually make a museum what it is and should be.""The endpapers, unusual in a pb, delighted me. One small criticism: he kept referring to color plates by number, but the color images were not numbered. Sometimes I had difficulty finding the image he meant. 311 He delighted me even more by extolling the important role libraries play, although (57-8) he writes as if librarians are the ones who think everything is easily found online. "
29,0007209886,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47645617-lauren,3,"I snatched up a copy of ""Dry Store Room No. 1"" during a casual after-work perusal of the library shelves. ""The Secret Life of the Natural History Museum,"" I said to myself, sticking it under my arm with fifteen other books that I will never find the time to read, ""That's like Night at the Museum! Only true!""... it's not like Night at the Museum. And I don't just mean that the dinosaur skeletons and diorama miniatures don't come to life. That's not really what I was expecting. Midnight trysts under the blue whale, maybe, or something along the lines of ""Oops, I knocked over this priceless skeleton and now I'm going to attempt to put it back together but I'm a paleobotanist, not a paleontologist and now I have to walk past that mangled, incorrectly pieced-together foot every time I come to work. Do you think anyone noticed?"" And there is a little of that - though not those instances exactly and not nearly as much as one would hope. What ""Dry Store Room No. 1"" really is, is a conversation with not-quite retired paleontologist Professor Richard Fortey. But it's that kind of conversation that you have with an older individual who is chock-full of fascinating stories gleaned from years of experience who tells them to you in a severely passionate and yet frustratingly meandering kind of way. Out of respect to Professor Fortey - as it is, after all, rude to walk away from a conversation - I stuck with this long after I realized it was both not what I had hoped it would be and in some places a little high above my understanding. Although the book is divided into chapters based on areas of study: biology, mineralogy, zoology, etc, the chapters themselves read like a run-on sentence covering the science of the topic, then maybe dithering into an anecdote or two about a colleague in the field, then some more science, then some very specific information about a single species, etc. It meant that I had to read in bits and pieces in order to keep my eyes from sliding off of the page, but at the end of it I feel I've gained appreciation for the genuine work that goes on behind the scenes at national institutions like the BM and genuine sorrow for the fact that these experts are becoming a dying breed. Next time, I'd love to have a conversation with Professor Fortey in person.Three stars: not for the content, more for the occasionally tough-to-follow eccentricity of the writing style."

There are a few bits of actual science sprinkled in, but mostly as a defense of the pure gathering of knowledge and its unpredictable practical application from time to time.The early perspective on technology does little to help. Perhaps in 2006 it was difficult to view large catalogs of images on one's device, but no one today would debate that information retrieval (whether text, image, or even video) is far more efficient on digital devices that dead tree forms. And the dismissal of modern digital engineers trying to build new hierarchies as just hackers playing with software feels somewhat luddite.Not sure this belonged in the science section of the library."

It was fascinating to understand the changes of the museum over the years, the relocation of collections and changes in research and conservation within the museum. This book has been on my 'to read list' for years, after I attended a lecture by Richard Fortey at the Natural History Museum and had my copy signed. It is a fascinating book exploring the hidden world of working in a natural history museum. I liked how to book wandered around from topic to topic, like you are exploring the different hidden rooms and galleries, opening different doors to see what they contain. I enjoyed reading it, and it is something you can dip in and out of. Some chapters were more interesting than others, but there is likely to be something for everyone. I think this book would appeal to anyone interested in how museums are run or looking to work in a museum, or interested in nature and science, and how science communication has changed over the years. I would recommend this book to young adults who are interested in science and curation. "
32,0007209886,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5876945-ryan,2,"This book started off strong, with a behind the scenes tour from a veteran who has spent all his working life at this venerable institution. For natural history buffs it is obviously fascinating to be introduced to all the workings and characters, from the time the author joined in the 1960s and all the changes since. However as Fortey gets more into the details and nitty gritty of the cast and more obscure collections it is difficult to sustain interest in the goings on. I had to give it up for good nearing the final chapters after reading about the back stories of scores of ex-staff. I would highly recommend the first two or three chapters to anyone curious about what is beyond the public galleries. Naming and classifying organisms may seem boring but we cannot protect what we don't know and taxonomy is the basic foundation underlying conservation, and this book explains it all with passion."
33,0007209886,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2890743-mike-violano,5,"There is abundant dry British humor in the Dry Storeroom #1. Author Fortey, a trilobite scientist at the Natural History Museum in London, entertains with this behind the scenes history and secrets of the scholarship of the museum’s vast collections. From the 19th century rows of cabinets of curiosities to the more recent galleries that educate and entertain visitors of all ages there is much to learn in these chapters. Museum scientists uncover known and unknown species from the deep oceans, desert sands and find tiny critters under rotting logs. In the chapter on “Old World”, the author describes how and where primitive plants dating back to the dinosaurs have survived in greater numbers that animals. The most fun is found in the chapter on “Animalia” which is actually populated with past directors, department heads long departed and scores of trustees who range from royalty and heroes to imposters and villains. A book to savor and a perfect armchair escape for a summer’s day."

Loved how there was various chapters on cool science topics such as Botany, Geology, Biology and Entomology (that's bugs). I liked the back-of-house history of notable characters in the museums history, and a chronology of the museum's importance (and others like it) in the world's educational theater. I will have to note, that if you read the back cover you would think that this book was going to be about various old museum exhibits with their interesting stories full of scandal and intrigue. For the most part none of that happened.I give it five stars because it promotes Science, was well written and a nice glimpse into a career from someone who genuinely cared for what he was a part of. Richard Fortay was a charming author who represented Science professionals from all fields very well. Nice job!."

I was expecting a fascinating trip through the various treasures of the museum's Dry Storeroom #1. I didn't realize the title was simply a metaphor for the author's ""jumbled locker-room of memory."" The book did feature some of the museum's holdings, but it seemed more time was devoted to gossip about the peculiar habits of this scientist or that collector. Not that some of the stories weren't interesting -- I particularly liked the story of the expert on cryptogams (spore-producing plants) being recruited by the Minister of War to a team devoted to cracking cryptograms (ciphers) and ended providing an invaluable contribution specifically due to his experience with cryptogams.Another frequent topic in the book is taxonomy: its origins, its difficulties, and its importance. While I didn't mind the topic, I could certain imagine other readers skimming through a passage about a specimen that was originally in this genus but was later reclassified to that genus.Another reviewer compared the book to being at a party in conversation with someone droning on about something boring, who then suddenly says something interesting. This is an apt analogy. There were plenty of interesting bits, but there were an unfortunate number of less-than-interesting passages. Ultimately, while this book could have been so much more, it may be worth a look for anyone interested in what goes on behind the scenes at a museum."

Partly it's because so little of the book was actually about ""Dry Store Room No. 1"" (which is where they keep all the oddities) and partly it's because the author's voice didn't work for me -- he is too wealthy, too privileged, and perhaps too English (in that particular way the English have of celebrating amateurs) for me.

This is a special kind of book. A marmite book. It's a memoir of a scientist, of a museum, and of a whole era too in a lot of ways. 
 
It manages to cram a history of Taxonomy, the science of classifying things, a personal memoir, a history of the radical changes a century wrought to science in general, particularly the effect Darwin had on all fields of biology, a complete history of the incredible British Museum of Natural History, a biography of Linnaeus, discussion on the value of the colonial legacy of botanical gardens, a history of the changes to the British civil service in the past 40 odd years, a grounding in basic latin and greek, and .... well you get the idea. In fact, I think all the things I listed are covered before the half way point. There's a lot of book in this book!
 
It's a bit of a dry read, unless you're really fascinated by that kind of thing which I am.
It's chock full of hilarious anecdotes too.  You just have to slog through a bit of science to find them.
 
Like the one about the marine cryptogam expert (that's fungi) who was mistaken for a cryptogram expert (note the extra r in there) and whisked off to Bletchley park during the war - only to accidentally save the day (and possibly the war) when he was the only one who knew how to save and restore German codebooks retrieved from a sunken submarine. 
 
I read a good chunk of this, but then I was busy and set it to text-to-speech - which I really don't like usually, but I have this one posh english voice to use so I tried it out - and it actually worked pretty well. '
 
I suspect the audiobook version of this would be really great, if it's got a good narrator, and would probably get a whole 'nother star. In fact, I think I will look out for that, because there's SO much in this book, I am pretty sure I could read it another 3 times and still be finding new things.

Basically, I've been trained for four years to work in a museum (any position really, but my preference will always be registration and documentation of collections). Even though the field I work in has nothing to do with cultural heritage or museums (I do software testing, at the moment for a logistics company), I still love it. So, any vacation my husband and I have, we visit many museums and cultural heritage sites, we watch programs and films about museums, and of course I read books about them. That's how I came to 'Dry Store Room No. 1: The Secret Life of the Natural History Museum' by Richard Fortey. Rochard Fortey is a palaeontologist specialized in the study of trilobites who has worked for the Natural History Museum in London since 1973. This book is his personal store-room of memories of all that time working in the museum. Together with explanations of the how and why of the many types of scientific research undertaken at the Natural History Museum, its history and its building he tells of the people he's worked with all these years. That makes this book a strange introduction to the specific kind of natural science undertaken at a museum (hint, it's a LOT of taxonomy) and a book filled with gossip about the strange characters that worked (under tenure) for the museum. Because of its focus on science (which is totally understandable because that is Fortey's branch of business in the museum) I was disappointed by the book. I had expected/wanted a book about the museum itself. About the collection, the collectors, the conservation, the curators and the exhibitions. Understandable from my point of view, because that is my personal interest in museums. Back in the winter of 2005/2006 my husband and I did an internship at the micro-palaeontological department of the Earth Studies department of the University of Utrecht. Our task was to register and if needed repackage the collection (of ancient mouse teeth basically) in a database system. We had a wonderful introduction into the many difficulties of taxonomy. We also met many of the types of characters (including the scientists who don't retire). We were able to look behind the screens at several natural history museum. And my husband went on to work in Mallorca with the Myotragus collection there in his next internship (a collection that is mentioned in this book). That made most of the parts in this book familiar, and a bit too much (I'd rather read about conservation than taxonomy). Another thing that put me off was Fortey's gossip about his colleagues. I get that he's trying to describe the quirks of scientists in a museum, but I found it unnecessary to make it so personal (working all your life on just beetles is quirky enough for me). Still, for the most part I can't fault Fortey for my disappointment with the book, it is a good, if somewhat rambling description and defense of the importance of scientific research in museums. Three out of five stars, but this will probably be higher if the reader likes to read about (natural) science more."
53,0007209886,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1756815-wendell,3,"I suppose it’s inevitable to compare Dry Storeroom to Douglas Preston’s Dinosaurs in the Attic, though Fortey doesn’t come out ahead in the competition. On the other hand, his Life: A Natural History of the First Four Billion Years of Life on Earth was such a fine book that Dry Storeroom had every reason to be just as engaging. It isn’t, though, and I’m still not entirely sure why. I suspect it’s because Fortey focuses almost exclusively on the scientists who work “behind the scenes” in his museum (or who “worked” there—quite a few of them are dead), and the recounting of old gossip and long-forgotten eccentricities and peccadilloes isn’t nearly as intriguing as Fortey perhaps intended it to be. Throughout, I wanted to hear more about the science itself, about the specimens, about (for crying out loud) trilobites, which are Fortey’s area of specialty. Though he does a decent job of explaining the basics of taxonomy and nomenclature, including a discussion of the conceptual upheaval of the entire endeavor that has been occasioned by our modern capacity to trace species relationships through DNA analysis, all of it feels a tad superficial. Fortey mentions the fact that modern science has challenged the very concept of “species,” but doesn’t ever quite arrive at the point. Other than alluding to the classic “lumpers vs. splitters” feud, meanwhile, he doesn’t speak much about what all of this means for paleontologists, who are forced to erect and defend species on the basis of entirely external characteristics (given that DNA is unavailable). In light of Fortey’s interesting discussion of the complete revolution that took place in the understanding of the taxonomy of just one species of common marine snail, Littorina, following genetic analysis, or the fact that some workers claim that as few as 40% of living species of Conus are valid, one wonders what hope there might be (to take one example) for fossil Conus, a morass if ever there was one—and that’s just a single gastropod in a single (admittedly huge) phylum. I assume that Fortey and his publisher made their editorial decisions deliberately to avoid overwhelming the scientifically handicapped, but I couldn’t help but feel that the dumbing-down sometimes went too far. Fortey takes several occasions to comment on the virtual extinction of the grand scientific enterprises that gave birth to our understanding of the systematics of living things, but he’s more wistful than angry about the way changing funding priorities and budget-slashing at universities and museums have made a victim of science. Anger, indeed, would be justified. Overall, Dry Storeroom is too long on anecdote and too short on analysis of the hard issues, and “popular” begins to bleed over into the territory of the run-of-the-mill. It’s a privilege to read Fortey; it’s just that I suspect he has much more compelling things to say."
54,0007209886,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9820302-sheila,3,"I really enjoyed this chatty and clever memoir of life in the Natural History Museum in London... until the end, when Fortey criticizes the Third World for its failure to properly collect and categorize the life forms that are rapidly disappearing from earth. To Fortey, this is an unspeakable tragedy, that something should die off before it can be named and classified. At this point the reader who knows the history of British colonialism has to slap palm against forehead and think, ""Hold on. Where did Britain (or the US, or France, etc) get the $$$ to build, staff, and stuff these enormous museums?"" The answer is, by stealing land, human beings, labor, resources and intellectual property from Indigenous peoples and the very Third World Fortey criticizes.Museums, of course, are wonderful places... or are they? The American Museum of Natural History in NYC delighted me when I was a child. I was ignorant of its racist history, that museums were trophy halls for the spoils of war and conquest. Museums displayed the new possessions (feathered, footed, and finned) of the ever-curious and acquisitive European. Little did I suspect that there were crypts in which European ""scientists"" could collect and study the remains of whomever they deemed to be less than human. (The heads of Native warriors killed in battle by the US cavalry were sometimes chopped off and sold to museums.) While I was mesmerized by the gorgeous dioramas and stuffed animals, I knew nothing of the white hunters who were busy decimating the African plains of ""game."" Aren't we lucky that the animals who fell to the industrial revolution left one valiant specimen (or two) for our viewing pleasure?A couple of years ago an article appeared which pointed out that Native Americans actually had a more accurate understanding of the nature of wolves than PhD scientists. Why? Well, even though they didn't know those all-important Latin names, the Native people observed wolves in the real world. They did not shoot, dissect, or stuff them or stick them in laboratories, zoos, or museums. Native cultures respect life, and do not look upon animals and plants and minerals as ""resources"" and commodities. I am not opposed to ""science,"" but Life forms would be better served if corporations stopped destroying the planet and impoverishing billions of people. If that happened. the animals and plants would not disappear, and children - not just privileged kids in imperial nations - could actually go outside and look at them in their natural environment. A living animal is always better than a stuffed one.And can we please get rid of that racist statue in front of the AMNH? The one of Teddy Roosevelt astride a horse, towering over an African walking beside him on one side and a Native American (also on foot) on his other side? The time of colonialism and its art and science is oveer.."
55,0007209886,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43477226-todd-stockslager,4,"Behind-the-scenes look at London's Natural History Museum is an interesting peak at the ""coalface""--Fortey's term for the daily work occurring beyond and below the public galleries--of museum science. Fortey describes the main work of the Museum, and its sister institutions in other countries, as systematic taxonomy--the attempt to exhaustively categorize and collect reference examples of each species of plant, animal, and mineral.In an era of hard-to-obtain research grants and declining public funding, Fortey defends this work as valuable for several reasons:--the need to find and identify species before they are destroyed by climate change, environmental destruction, or over-harvesting.--potential beneficial uses of unknown species for the biosphere, for example expanded use of natural predators as environmentally-safe pesticides.--helping future scientific endeavors by placing each species in its proper place in the taxonomy.--and ultimately, the pure aesthetic satisfaction of knowing everything we can know about the world in which we live and upon which we are dependent.Fortey spends time walking the reader virtually through the hidden corridors of each section of the Museum and using the discussion of the physical surroundings to talk in layman's terms about the science and the history of the science. Black-and-white photos in the pages with the text and color plates in the center of the book illustrate the surroundings and the collection as Fortey describes them.But most interesting are the people who work behind the scenes. The current and past scientists, curators, clerks, Keepers, Directors, and Trustees are a diverse, intelligent, and intensely fascinating lot. After describing some of the more legendary polymaths who seemed as if they would scarcely have time to indulge in their many interests, Fortey asks in wonderment: ""Are we lesser people today, or do we expect less of ourselves?""Of course the Museum also has its share of misfits, misanthropes, recluses, shysters, and just plain crazy people deep in the hallways behind the public galleries, and Fortey seems to take special glee in describing them, many of whom he knew personally from his 30-plus years in the corridors. He writes with an understated, decidedly British wit and language. I'm guessing I missed some of his best jokes as they glanced off my tin American ear, but unless you get the opportunity to tour the hallways (which he compares to the phantasmagorical and never-ending castle in the The Gormenghast Novels) with Fortey in person, this book will be your personal tour guide."
56,0007209886,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1385097-harry-rutherford,4,"Dry Store Room No. 1: The Secret Life of the Natural History Museum is about the behind-the-scenes work at the Natural History Museum in London. Whether you find that an appealing subject for a book depends, I suppose, on your feelings about museums and/or natural history; personally I found it irresistible.The public face of the museum — animatronic dinosaurs and overexcited schoolchildren — gives relatively little sense of the scientific work that goes on behind the scenes, all of which is centred on the museum's collection of biological specimens: pressed plants, trays of pinned beetles, drawers full of bird skins or fossils, jars of starfish in alcohol. The sheer scale of these collections is hard to comprehend: the museum holds over 70 million specimens. That means every person in the UK could be given one to take home and they'd still have enough left over for everyone in Sweden. 28 million of them are insects.The collections haven't been accumulated simply through an excess of acquisitiveness, although there must be some connection between the satisfaction biologists get from collecting beetles and other people's collections of stamps, obscure soul 45s or golf memorabilia. The point of the collection is that it is a vast reference library: if you find an earwig in Burma and you're not sure whether it's a new species, you can start by checking the literature; but if all else fails, the last resort is to go to a museum, open up the drawers full of earwigs, and start peering at them through a microscope.This kind of taxonomical work — preparing specimens, describing species, working out their relationships, publishing highly technical articles about it — might seem to be complete drudgery to an outsider; it is slow, careful, precise, unglamorous. But it obviously has a hold on people, because the book is full of people who spend decades working on some particular group of organisms, retire, and then keep coming in to the museum to continue their work in retirement. Fortey himself is apparently one of them, retired in 2006 but still working away at his trilobites.The books combines a history of the museum, examples of the work done there, anecdotes about characters on the staff (not surprisingly, perhaps, there have been a few notable eccentrics) and a passionate defence of taxonomy as a valuable field of study. It's well-written, frequently entertaining, pitched at the interested amateur, and I thoroughly enjoyed it."
57,0007209886,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15743853-don,4,"I found the title of this excellent book a little misleading - I came to it expecting it to be mostly about people and their lives - the 'scandals and skulduggery', as the blurb has it. It turned out to be a great deal more than that - it is mainly about the work of the Natural History Museum (which is mostly taxonomy and curation; the classification of the natural world - living, fossil and mineral - and the preservation of examples that illustrate it), why it is important, and how the perception of that importance has changed over the years. For anyone interested in natural history, and in the great national museums devoted to it, this is essential and fascinating reading. However, there is a strong undercurrent flowing through this book that makes it rather better, and more important, than might at first appear. In charting those changes in perception of the Museum's work, shown in part through the extraordinary cast of characters that have worked there, Fortey records the progressive changes in how its work has been funded (and, increasingly, not funded) - and the political forces that have driven those changes. He ends on an optimistic note, observing that the advent of the internet, the drive to digitise historical records and the movement to publish on-line have had the effect of 'democratising' taxonomy. He envisages a return to the era of the gifted amateur who develops expertise in a chosen corner of the living world, but now including many people in the developing world who in past times would have been excluded from such activities. These amateurs would be supported by professional taxonomists whose principal tool is DNA analysis, but who would also (Fortey thinks) exercise a benign oversight to prevent the whole enterprise developing chaotically, with a proliferation of inadequately defined species, many of which might be figments of the naturalist's imagination. There is some virtue in this vision - although I suspect there is also a good deal of wishful thinking. How much better it would be if government paymasters realised for themselves the value of the work done by museums - and other government scientific agencies - which in the long term is likely to be of greater lasting significance than the plethora of 'peer-reviewed' scientific papers by which the worth of scientists and their work is currently judged.

58,0007209886,http://goodreads.com/user/show/339857-cindy,4,"Themes: natural history, conservation, research, weird scienceSetting: The Natural History Museum in London, EnglandEver read books where they talk about going up to the British Museum for the day? Well, the British Museum is now the Natural History Museum (and a few other spin-offs) and Fortey takes the reader behind the scenes for an insider's view on what really goes on in such a huge museum.Fortey started his career as a biologist back when the museum was a slightly stuffier and more serious place, and only retired a few years ago, by which time the museum had become more of an attraction and began updating exhibits to attract paying guests. But the focus remains on the science. However, his book isn't really just about the history of the museum, its contributions to English scientific understanding and so on, but rather his own experiences, acquaintances, his explorations of all the hidden little corners of the vast building, and the gossip about the many folks who work there.And what juicy gossip there is! You wouldn't think that there would be much room for racy anecdotes among the dry and serious types who work at the museum, but wow, you would be so wrong. This and the Shakespeare book both convince me that gossip was much more interesting before it started revolving around which celebrity was sleeping with whom, which had an eating disorder, and who is feuding with whom.For his format, he starts with the collections of the museum, from mammals and plants and insects (lots of great stories there) to minerals and then the nuts and bolts of how such a place is run and what it takes to keep it going. The book is full of quirky personalities, which makes it so much more fun to read. He does stick his own opinions in there about evolution and religion, about the need to preserve every single species no matter how obscure, about the damage human beings are doing to the planet, about his political views, but he keeps those parts fairly brief and gets on with the more interesting stories of people he has met and colorful characters from the museum's past. I really enjoyed one. Recommended."
59,0007209886,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39215456-chris,2,"This book nearly defeated me on three separate occasions, I resisted the urge to put the book down and walk away only because I couldn't let it beat me. Don't make the same mistake I did, don't start the book.I should start off by saying the book reads less like a nonfiction book, more like a bland textbook. Dr. Fortey could have stopped after the first word and come up with a more accurate title. This is coming from someone who typically enjoys natural history and who gets excited about the prospect of sitting in a small, stuffy little office in the bowels of some old building.The book reads like a disjointed series of tidbits, sorted roughly into categories (Zoology, Botany, Entomology, etc.) and within those tidbits, Fortey frequently gets distracted and sidetracked, offering asides and sidebars that neither add anything nor help to make the main story any more interesting or intelligible. In addition, you're bombarded with an onslaught of names that go in one ear and out the other even though each only matters for the three or four paragraphs dedicated to each individual.The book drags on, each anecdote more similar to the one before. EL Harvishire, the diatom man, was digging in West Bromwich, Staffordshire, between 1909 and 1916 and published The Catalogue of the Freshwater Diatoms of the West Bromwich Manor House Garden Pond and he told me he found forty new species there.Change the names, add a few more sentences (likely about how EL Harvishire still comes in to the NHM every Monday and how technology will be the downfall of taxonomy), then copy and paste a few hundred times and you can be the author of Dry Storeroom No. 2!I should say however, there is a reason I'm giving Dr Storeroom No. 1 2 stars instead of one. Amongst the disjointed, uninteresting pieces, every one and a while, there is a gem, something interesting. While they only last a page or two. The sprinkling of them throughout helped me to power on. Would I recommend the book on this basis? No, but if you find yourself on a deserted island with nothing but this book, just know, theres something good in there."

There are a few bits of actual science sprinkled in, but mostly as a defense of the pure gathering of knowledge and its unpredictable practical application from time to time.The early perspective on technology does little to help. Perhaps in 2006 it was difficult to view large catalogs of images on one's device, but no one today would debate that information retrieval (whether text, image, or even video) is far more efficient on digital devices that dead tree forms. And the dismissal of modern digital engineers trying to build new hierarchies as just hackers playing with software feels somewhat luddite.Not sure this belonged in the science section of the library."
61,0007209886,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5514516-genetic-cuckoo,3,"This was a lovely collection of stories and anecdotes from behind the scenes at the Natural History Museum. It was fascinating to understand the changes of the museum over the years, the relocation of collections and changes in research and conservation within the museum. This book has been on my 'to read list' for years, after I attended a lecture by Richard Fortey at the Natural History Museum and had my copy signed. It is a fascinating book exploring the hidden world of working in a natural history museum. I liked how to book wandered around from topic to topic, like you are exploring the different hidden rooms and galleries, opening different doors to see what they contain. I enjoyed reading it, and it is something you can dip in and out of. Some chapters were more interesting than others, but there is likely to be something for everyone. I think this book would appeal to anyone interested in how museums are run or looking to work in a museum, or interested in nature and science, and how science communication has changed over the years. I would recommend this book to young adults who are interested in science and curation. "
62,0007209886,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5876945-ryan,2,"This book started off strong, with a behind the scenes tour from a veteran who has spent all his working life at this venerable institution. For natural history buffs it is obviously fascinating to be introduced to all the workings and characters, from the time the author joined in the 1960s and all the changes since. However as Fortey gets more into the details and nitty gritty of the cast and more obscure collections it is difficult to sustain interest in the goings on. I had to give it up for good nearing the final chapters after reading about the back stories of scores of ex-staff. I would highly recommend the first two or three chapters to anyone curious about what is beyond the public galleries. Naming and classifying organisms may seem boring but we cannot protect what we don't know and taxonomy is the basic foundation underlying conservation, and this book explains it all with passion."
63,0007209886,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2890743-mike-violano,5,"There is abundant dry British humor in the Dry Storeroom #1. Author Fortey, a trilobite scientist at the Natural History Museum in London, entertains with this behind the scenes history and secrets of the scholarship of the museum’s vast collections. From the 19th century rows of cabinets of curiosities to the more recent galleries that educate and entertain visitors of all ages there is much to learn in these chapters. Museum scientists uncover known and unknown species from the deep oceans, desert sands and find tiny critters under rotting logs. In the chapter on “Old World”, the author describes how and where primitive plants dating back to the dinosaurs have survived in greater numbers that animals. The most fun is found in the chapter on “Animalia” which is actually populated with past directors, department heads long departed and scores of trustees who range from royalty and heroes to imposters and villains. A book to savor and a perfect armchair escape for a summer’s day."

I liked the back-of-house history of notable characters in the museums history, and a chronology of the museum's importance (and others like it) in the world's educational theater. I will have to note, that if you read the back cover you would think that this book was going to be about various old museum exhibits with their interesting stories full of scandal and intrigue. For the most part none of that happened.I give it five stars because it promotes Science, was well written and a nice glimpse into a career from someone who genuinely cared for what he was a part of.

I was expecting a fascinating trip through the various treasures of the museum's Dry Storeroom #1. I didn't realize the title was simply a metaphor for the author's ""jumbled locker-room of memory."" The book did feature some of the museum's holdings, but it seemed more time was devoted to gossip about the peculiar habits of this scientist or that collector. Not that some of the stories weren't interesting -- I particularly liked the story of the expert on cryptogams (spore-producing plants) being recruited by the Minister of War to a team devoted to cracking cryptograms (ciphers) and ended providing an invaluable contribution specifically due to his experience with cryptogams.Another frequent topic in the book is taxonomy: its origins, its difficulties, and its importance. While I didn't mind the topic, I could certain imagine other readers skimming through a passage about a specimen that was originally in this genus but was later reclassified to that genus.Another reviewer compared the book to being at a party in conversation with someone droning on about something boring, who then suddenly says something interesting. This is an apt analogy. There were plenty of interesting bits, but there were an unfortunate number of less-than-interesting passages. Ultimately, while this book could have been so much more, it may be worth a look for anyone interested in what goes on behind the scenes at a museum."

This is a special kind of book. A marmite book. It's a memoir of a scientist, of a museum, and of a whole era too in a lot of ways. 
 
It manages to cram a history of Taxonomy, the science of classifying things, a personal memoir, a history of the radical changes a century wrought to science in general, particularly the effect Darwin had on all fields of biology, a complete history of the incredible British Museum of Natural History, a biography of Linnaeus, discussion on the value of the colonial legacy of botanical gardens, a history of the changes to the British civil service in the past 40 odd years, a grounding in basic latin and greek, and .... well you get the idea. In fact, I think all the things I listed are covered before the half way point. There's a lot of book in this book!
 
It's a bit of a dry read, unless you're really fascinated by that kind of thing which I am.
It's chock full of hilarious anecdotes too.  You just have to slog through a bit of science to find them.
 
Like the one about the marine cryptogam expert (that's fungi) who was mistaken for a cryptogram expert (note the extra r in there) and whisked off to Bletchley park during the war - only to accidentally save the day (and possibly the war) when he was the only one who knew how to save and restore German codebooks retrieved from a sunken submarine. 
 
I read a good chunk of this, but then I was busy and set it to text-to-speech - which I really don't like usually, but I have this one posh english voice to use so I tried it out - and it actually worked pretty well. '
 
I suspect the audiobook version of this would be really great, if it's got a good narrator, and would probably get a whole 'nother star. In fact, I think I will look out for that, because there's SO much in this book, I am pretty sure I could read it another 3 times and still be finding new things.

81,0007209886,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54683202-clive-bevitt,3,A overview and history of the Natural History Museum. At times both a little dry and gossipy for me.
82,0007209886,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35553726-sara,3,"My college degree (Dutch: HBO) is in Cultural Heritage, but before they changed the name of the degree a couple of weeks before the graduation ceremony, it was museology. Basically, I've been trained for four years to work in a museum (any position really, but my preference will always be registration and documentation of collections). Even though the field I work in has nothing to do with cultural heritage or museums (I do software testing, at the moment for a logistics company), I still love it. So, any vacation my husband and I have, we visit many museums and cultural heritage sites, we watch programs and films about museums, and of course I read books about them. That's how I came to 'Dry Store Room No. 1: The Secret Life of the Natural History Museum' by Richard Fortey. Rochard Fortey is a palaeontologist specialized in the study of trilobites who has worked for the Natural History Museum in London since 1973. This book is his personal store-room of memories of all that time working in the museum. Together with explanations of the how and why of the many types of scientific research undertaken at the Natural History Museum, its history and its building he tells of the people he's worked with all these years. That makes this book a strange introduction to the specific kind of natural science undertaken at a museum (hint, it's a LOT of taxonomy) and a book filled with gossip about the strange characters that worked (under tenure) for the museum. Because of its focus on science (which is totally understandable because that is Fortey's branch of business in the museum) I was disappointed by the book. I had expected/wanted a book about the museum itself. About the collection, the collectors, the conservation, the curators and the exhibitions. Understandable from my point of view, because that is my personal interest in museums. Back in the winter of 2005/2006 my husband and I did an internship at the micro-palaeontological department of the Earth Studies department of the University of Utrecht. Our task was to register and if needed repackage the collection (of ancient mouse teeth basically) in a database system. We had a wonderful introduction into the many difficulties of taxonomy. We also met many of the types of characters (including the scientists who don't retire). We were able to look behind the screens at several natural history museum. And my husband went on to work in Mallorca with the Myotragus collection there in his next internship (a collection that is mentioned in this book). That made most of the parts in this book familiar, and a bit too much (I'd rather read about conservation than taxonomy). Another thing that put me off was Fortey's gossip about his colleagues. I get that he's trying to describe the quirks of scientists in a museum, but I found it unnecessary to make it so personal (working all your life on just beetles is quirky enough for me). Still, for the most part I can't fault Fortey for my disappointment with the book, it is a good, if somewhat rambling description and defense of the importance of scientific research in museums. Three out of five stars, but this will probably be higher if the reader likes to read about (natural) science more."
83,0007209886,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1756815-wendell,3,"I suppose it’s inevitable to compare Dry Storeroom to Douglas Preston’s Dinosaurs in the Attic, though Fortey doesn’t come out ahead in the competition. On the other hand, his Life: A Natural History of the First Four Billion Years of Life on Earth was such a fine book that Dry Storeroom had every reason to be just as engaging. It isn’t, though, and I’m still not entirely sure why. I suspect it’s because Fortey focuses almost exclusively on the scientists who work “behind the scenes” in his museum (or who “worked” there—quite a few of them are dead), and the recounting of old gossip and long-forgotten eccentricities and peccadilloes isn’t nearly as intriguing as Fortey perhaps intended it to be. Throughout, I wanted to hear more about the science itself, about the specimens, about (for crying out loud) trilobites, which are Fortey’s area of specialty. Though he does a decent job of explaining the basics of taxonomy and nomenclature, including a discussion of the conceptual upheaval of the entire endeavor that has been occasioned by our modern capacity to trace species relationships through DNA analysis, all of it feels a tad superficial. Fortey mentions the fact that modern science has challenged the very concept of “species,” but doesn’t ever quite arrive at the point. Other than alluding to the classic “lumpers vs. splitters” feud, meanwhile, he doesn’t speak much about what all of this means for paleontologists, who are forced to erect and defend species on the basis of entirely external characteristics (given that DNA is unavailable). In light of Fortey’s interesting discussion of the complete revolution that took place in the understanding of the taxonomy of just one species of common marine snail, Littorina, following genetic analysis, or the fact that some workers claim that as few as 40% of living species of Conus are valid, one wonders what hope there might be (to take one example) for fossil Conus, a morass if ever there was one—and that’s just a single gastropod in a single (admittedly huge) phylum. I assume that Fortey and his publisher made their editorial decisions deliberately to avoid overwhelming the scientifically handicapped, but I couldn’t help but feel that the dumbing-down sometimes went too far. Fortey takes several occasions to comment on the virtual extinction of the grand scientific enterprises that gave birth to our understanding of the systematics of living things, but he’s more wistful than angry about the way changing funding priorities and budget-slashing at universities and museums have made a victim of science. Anger, indeed, would be justified. Overall, Dry Storeroom is too long on anecdote and too short on analysis of the hard issues, and “popular” begins to bleed over into the territory of the run-of-the-mill. It’s a privilege to read Fortey; it’s just that I suspect he has much more compelling things to say."
84,0007209886,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9820302-sheila,3,"I really enjoyed this chatty and clever memoir of life in the Natural History Museum in London... until the end, when Fortey criticizes the Third World for its failure to properly collect and categorize the life forms that are rapidly disappearing from earth. To Fortey, this is an unspeakable tragedy, that something should die off before it can be named and classified. At this point the reader who knows the history of British colonialism has to slap palm against forehead and think, ""Hold on. Where did Britain (or the US, or France, etc) get the $$$ to build, staff, and stuff these enormous museums?"" The answer is, by stealing land, human beings, labor, resources and intellectual property from Indigenous peoples and the very Third World Fortey criticizes.Museums, of course, are wonderful places... or are they? The American Museum of Natural History in NYC delighted me when I was a child. I was ignorant of its racist history, that museums were trophy halls for the spoils of war and conquest. Museums displayed the new possessions (feathered, footed, and finned) of the ever-curious and acquisitive European. Little did I suspect that there were crypts in which European ""scientists"" could collect and study the remains of whomever they deemed to be less than human. (The heads of Native warriors killed in battle by the US cavalry were sometimes chopped off and sold to museums.) While I was mesmerized by the gorgeous dioramas and stuffed animals, I knew nothing of the white hunters who were busy decimating the African plains of ""game."" Aren't we lucky that the animals who fell to the industrial revolution left one valiant specimen (or two) for our viewing pleasure?A couple of years ago an article appeared which pointed out that Native Americans actually had a more accurate understanding of the nature of wolves than PhD scientists. Why? Well, even though they didn't know those all-important Latin names, the Native people observed wolves in the real world. They did not shoot, dissect, or stuff them or stick them in laboratories, zoos, or museums. Native cultures respect life, and do not look upon animals and plants and minerals as ""resources"" and commodities. I am not opposed to ""science,"" but Life forms would be better served if corporations stopped destroying the planet and impoverishing billions of people. If that happened. the animals and plants would not disappear, and children - not just privileged kids in imperial nations - could actually go outside and look at them in their natural environment. A living animal is always better than a stuffed one.And can we please get rid of that racist statue in front of the AMNH? The one of Teddy Roosevelt astride a horse, towering over an African walking beside him on one side and a Native American (also on foot) on his other side? The time of colonialism and its art and science is oveer.."
85,0007209886,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43477226-todd-stockslager,4,"Behind-the-scenes look at London's Natural History Museum is an interesting peak at the ""coalface""--Fortey's term for the daily work occurring beyond and below the public galleries--of museum science. Fortey describes the main work of the Museum, and its sister institutions in other countries, as systematic taxonomy--the attempt to exhaustively categorize and collect reference examples of each species of plant, animal, and mineral.In an era of hard-to-obtain research grants and declining public funding, Fortey defends this work as valuable for several reasons:--the need to find and identify species before they are destroyed by climate change, environmental destruction, or over-harvesting.--potential beneficial uses of unknown species for the biosphere, for example expanded use of natural predators as environmentally-safe pesticides.--helping future scientific endeavors by placing each species in its proper place in the taxonomy.--and ultimately, the pure aesthetic satisfaction of knowing everything we can know about the world in which we live and upon which we are dependent.Fortey spends time walking the reader virtually through the hidden corridors of each section of the Museum and using the discussion of the physical surroundings to talk in layman's terms about the science and the history of the science. Black-and-white photos in the pages with the text and color plates in the center of the book illustrate the surroundings and the collection as Fortey describes them.But most interesting are the people who work behind the scenes. The current and past scientists, curators, clerks, Keepers, Directors, and Trustees are a diverse, intelligent, and intensely fascinating lot. After describing some of the more legendary polymaths who seemed as if they would scarcely have time to indulge in their many interests, Fortey asks in wonderment: ""Are we lesser people today, or do we expect less of ourselves?""Of course the Museum also has its share of misfits, misanthropes, recluses, shysters, and just plain crazy people deep in the hallways behind the public galleries, and Fortey seems to take special glee in describing them, many of whom he knew personally from his 30-plus years in the corridors. He writes with an understated, decidedly British wit and language. I'm guessing I missed some of his best jokes as they glanced off my tin American ear, but unless you get the opportunity to tour the hallways (which he compares to the phantasmagorical and never-ending castle in the The Gormenghast Novels) with Fortey in person, this book will be your personal tour guide."
86,0007209886,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1385097-harry-rutherford,4,"Dry Store Room No. 1: The Secret Life of the Natural History Museum is about the behind-the-scenes work at the Natural History Museum in London. Whether you find that an appealing subject for a book depends, I suppose, on your feelings about museums and/or natural history; personally I found it irresistible.The public face of the museum — animatronic dinosaurs and overexcited schoolchildren — gives relatively little sense of the scientific work that goes on behind the scenes, all of which is centred on the museum's collection of biological specimens: pressed plants, trays of pinned beetles, drawers full of bird skins or fossils, jars of starfish in alcohol. The sheer scale of these collections is hard to comprehend: the museum holds over 70 million specimens. That means every person in the UK could be given one to take home and they'd still have enough left over for everyone in Sweden. 28 million of them are insects.The collections haven't been accumulated simply through an excess of acquisitiveness, although there must be some connection between the satisfaction biologists get from collecting beetles and other people's collections of stamps, obscure soul 45s or golf memorabilia. The point of the collection is that it is a vast reference library: if you find an earwig in Burma and you're not sure whether it's a new species, you can start by checking the literature; but if all else fails, the last resort is to go to a museum, open up the drawers full of earwigs, and start peering at them through a microscope.This kind of taxonomical work — preparing specimens, describing species, working out their relationships, publishing highly technical articles about it — might seem to be complete drudgery to an outsider; it is slow, careful, precise, unglamorous. But it obviously has a hold on people, because the book is full of people who spend decades working on some particular group of organisms, retire, and then keep coming in to the museum to continue their work in retirement. Fortey himself is apparently one of them, retired in 2006 but still working away at his trilobites.The books combines a history of the museum, examples of the work done there, anecdotes about characters on the staff (not surprisingly, perhaps, there have been a few notable eccentrics) and a passionate defence of taxonomy as a valuable field of study. It's well-written, frequently entertaining, pitched at the interested amateur, and I thoroughly enjoyed it."
87,0007209886,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15743853-don,4,"I found the title of this excellent book a little misleading - I came to it expecting it to be mostly about people and their lives - the 'scandals and skulduggery', as the blurb has it. It turned out to be a great deal more than that - it is mainly about the work of the Natural History Museum (which is mostly taxonomy and curation; the classification of the natural world - living, fossil and mineral - and the preservation of examples that illustrate it), why it is important, and how the perception of that importance has changed over the years. For anyone interested in natural history, and in the great national museums devoted to it, this is essential and fascinating reading. However, there is a strong undercurrent flowing through this book that makes it rather better, and more important, than might at first appear. In charting those changes in perception of the Museum's work, shown in part through the extraordinary cast of characters that have worked there, Fortey records the progressive changes in how its work has been funded (and, increasingly, not funded) - and the political forces that have driven those changes. He ends on an optimistic note, observing that the advent of the internet, the drive to digitise historical records and the movement to publish on-line have had the effect of 'democratising' taxonomy. He envisages a return to the era of the gifted amateur who develops expertise in a chosen corner of the living world, but now including many people in the developing world who in past times would have been excluded from such activities. These amateurs would be supported by professional taxonomists whose principal tool is DNA analysis, but who would also (Fortey thinks) exercise a benign oversight to prevent the whole enterprise developing chaotically, with a proliferation of inadequately defined species, many of which might be figments of the naturalist's imagination. There is some virtue in this vision - although I suspect there is also a good deal of wishful thinking. How much better it would be if government paymasters realised for themselves the value of the work done by museums - and other government scientific agencies - which in the long term is likely to be of greater lasting significance than the plethora of 'peer-reviewed' scientific papers by which the worth of scientists and their work is currently judged. "
88,0007209886,http://goodreads.com/user/show/339857-cindy,4,"Themes: natural history, conservation, research, weird scienceSetting: The Natural History Museum in London, EnglandEver read books where they talk about going up to the British Museum for the day? Well, the British Museum is now the Natural History Museum (and a few other spin-offs) and Fortey takes the reader behind the scenes for an insider's view on what really goes on in such a huge museum.Fortey started his career as a biologist back when the museum was a slightly stuffier and more serious place, and only retired a few years ago, by which time the museum had become more of an attraction and began updating exhibits to attract paying guests. But the focus remains on the science. However, his book isn't really just about the history of the museum, its contributions to English scientific understanding and so on, but rather his own experiences, acquaintances, his explorations of all the hidden little corners of the vast building, and the gossip about the many folks who work there.And what juicy gossip there is! You wouldn't think that there would be much room for racy anecdotes among the dry and serious types who work at the museum, but wow, you would be so wrong. This and the Shakespeare book both convince me that gossip was much more interesting before it started revolving around which celebrity was sleeping with whom, which had an eating disorder, and who is feuding with whom.For his format, he starts with the collections of the museum, from mammals and plants and insects (lots of great stories there) to minerals and then the nuts and bolts of how such a place is run and what it takes to keep it going. The book is full of quirky personalities, which makes it so much more fun to read. He does stick his own opinions in there about evolution and religion, about the need to preserve every single species no matter how obscure, about the damage human beings are doing to the planet, about his political views, but he keeps those parts fairly brief and gets on with the more interesting stories of people he has met and colorful characters from the museum's past. I really enjoyed one. Recommended."
89,0007209886,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39215456-chris,2,"This book nearly defeated me on three separate occasions, I resisted the urge to put the book down and walk away only because I couldn't let it beat me. Don't make the same mistake I did, don't start the book.I should start off by saying the book reads less like a nonfiction book, more like a bland textbook. Dr. Fortey could have stopped after the first word and come up with a more accurate title. This is coming from someone who typically enjoys natural history and who gets excited about the prospect of sitting in a small, stuffy little office in the bowels of some old building.The book reads like a disjointed series of tidbits, sorted roughly into categories (Zoology, Botany, Entomology, etc.) and within those tidbits, Fortey frequently gets distracted and sidetracked, offering asides and sidebars that neither add anything nor help to make the main story any more interesting or intelligible. In addition, you're bombarded with an onslaught of names that go in one ear and out the other even though each only matters for the three or four paragraphs dedicated to each individual.The book drags on, each anecdote more similar to the one before. EL Harvishire, the diatom man, was digging in West Bromwich, Staffordshire, between 1909 and 1916 and published The Catalogue of the Freshwater Diatoms of the West Bromwich Manor House Garden Pond and he told me he found forty new species there.Change the names, add a few more sentences (likely about how EL Harvishire still comes in to the NHM every Monday and how technology will be the downfall of taxonomy), then copy and paste a few hundred times and you can be the author of Dry Storeroom No. 2!I should say however, there is a reason I'm giving Dr Storeroom No. 1 2 stars instead of one. Amongst the disjointed, uninteresting pieces, every one and a while, there is a gem, something interesting. While they only last a page or two. The sprinkling of them throughout helped me to power on. Would I recommend the book on this basis? No, but if you find yourself on a deserted island with nothing but this book, just know, theres something good in there."
90,0007209886,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7880380-woolstar,1,"Dry.If you wonder what it was like to be a academic researcher back in the 1960s, amongst the hustle and bustle of Britain as it moved from post World War 2 to the modern age; this is one particular snapshot by someone who mostly feels that 99% of those changes were for the worse.You get to hear about a cast of characters with many faults, elbow patches, clashes between personalities, and the dismantling of science for science's sake. There are a few bits of actual science sprinkled in, but mostly as a defense of the pure gathering of knowledge and its unpredictable practical application from time to time.The early perspective on technology does little to help. Perhaps in 2006 it was difficult to view large catalogs of images on one's device, but no one today would debate that information retrieval (whether text, image, or even video) is far more efficient on digital devices that dead tree forms. And the dismissal of modern digital engineers trying to build new hierarchies as just hackers playing with software feels somewhat luddite.Not sure this belonged in the science section of the library."
91,0007209886,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5514516-genetic-cuckoo,3,"This was a lovely collection of stories and anecdotes from behind the scenes at the Natural History Museum. It was fascinating to understand the changes of the museum over the years, the relocation of collections and changes in research and conservation within the museum. This book has been on my 'to read list' for years, after I attended a lecture by Richard Fortey at the Natural History Museum and had my copy signed. It is a fascinating book exploring the hidden world of working in a natural history museum. I liked how to book wandered around from topic to topic, like you are exploring the different hidden rooms and galleries, opening different doors to see what they contain. I enjoyed reading it, and it is something you can dip in and out of. Some chapters were more interesting than others, but there is likely to be something for everyone. I think this book would appeal to anyone interested in how museums are run or looking to work in a museum, or interested in nature and science, and how science communication has changed over the years. I would recommend this book to young adults who are interested in science and curation. "
92,0007209886,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5876945-ryan,2,"This book started off strong, with a behind the scenes tour from a veteran who has spent all his working life at this venerable institution. For natural history buffs it is obviously fascinating to be introduced to all the workings and characters, from the time the author joined in the 1960s and all the changes since. However as Fortey gets more into the details and nitty gritty of the cast and more obscure collections it is difficult to sustain interest in the goings on. I had to give it up for good nearing the final chapters after reading about the back stories of scores of ex-staff. I would highly recommend the first two or three chapters to anyone curious about what is beyond the public galleries. Naming and classifying organisms may seem boring but we cannot protect what we don't know and taxonomy is the basic foundation underlying conservation, and this book explains it all with passion."
93,0007209886,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2890743-mike-violano,5,"There is abundant dry British humor in the Dry Storeroom #1. Author Fortey, a trilobite scientist at the Natural History Museum in London, entertains with this behind the scenes history and secrets of the scholarship of the museum’s vast collections. From the 19th century rows of cabinets of curiosities to the more recent galleries that educate and entertain visitors of all ages there is much to learn in these chapters. Museum scientists uncover known and unknown species from the deep oceans, desert sands and find tiny critters under rotting logs. In the chapter on “Old World”, the author describes how and where primitive plants dating back to the dinosaurs have survived in greater numbers that animals. The most fun is found in the chapter on “Animalia” which is actually populated with past directors, department heads long departed and scores of trustees who range from royalty and heroes to imposters and villains. A book to savor and a perfect armchair escape for a summer’s day."

Loved how there was various chapters on cool science topics such as Botany, Geology, Biology and Entomology (that's bugs). I liked the back-of-house history of notable characters in the museums history, and a chronology of the museum's importance (and others like it) in the world's educational theater. I will have to note, that if you read the back cover you would think that this book was going to be about various old museum exhibits with their interesting stories full of scandal and intrigue. For the most part none of that happened.I give it five stars because it promotes Science, was well written and a nice glimpse into a career from someone who genuinely cared for what he was a part of. Richard Fortay was a charming author who represented Science professionals from all fields very well. Nice job!."

I was expecting a fascinating trip through the various treasures of the museum's Dry Storeroom #1. I didn't realize the title was simply a metaphor for the author's ""jumbled locker-room of memory."" The book did feature some of the museum's holdings, but it seemed more time was devoted to gossip about the peculiar habits of this scientist or that collector. Not that some of the stories weren't interesting -- I particularly liked the story of the expert on cryptogams (spore-producing plants) being recruited by the Minister of War to a team devoted to cracking cryptograms (ciphers) and ended providing an invaluable contribution specifically due to his experience with cryptogams.Another frequent topic in the book is taxonomy: its origins, its difficulties, and its importance. While I didn't mind the topic, I could certain imagine other readers skimming through a passage about a specimen that was originally in this genus but was later reclassified to that genus.Another reviewer compared the book to being at a party in conversation with someone droning on about something boring, who then suddenly says something interesting. This is an apt analogy. There were plenty of interesting bits, but there were an unfortunate number of less-than-interesting passages. Ultimately, while this book could have been so much more, it may be worth a look for anyone interested in what goes on behind the scenes at a museum."

HahaThis book was really fascinating. I've just always dreamed of working in a museum, even as my focus and interests have changed, so it was really cool to just read about it and get a little peak into that life."

I love books about ""stuff"" -- cultural histories of objects (such as the screw, the pencil, etc.) and I love books about museums, especially collecting museums. But this book didn't work for me. Partly it's because so little of the book was actually about ""Dry Store Room No. 1"" (which is where they keep all the oddities) and partly it's because the author's voice didn't work for me -- he is too wealthy, too privileged, and perhaps too English (in that particular way the English have of celebrating amateurs) for me.

This is a special kind of book. A marmite book. It's a memoir of a scientist, of a museum, and of a whole era too in a lot of ways. 
 
It manages to cram a history of Taxonomy, the science of classifying things, a personal memoir, a history of the radical changes a century wrought to science in general, particularly the effect Darwin had on all fields of biology, a complete history of the incredible British Museum of Natural History, a biography of Linnaeus, discussion on the value of the colonial legacy of botanical gardens, a history of the changes to the British civil service in the past 40 odd years, a grounding in basic latin and greek, and .... well you get the idea. In fact, I think all the things I listed are covered before the half way point. There's a lot of book in this book!
 
It's a bit of a dry read, unless you're really fascinated by that kind of thing which I am.
It's chock full of hilarious anecdotes too.  You just have to slog through a bit of science to find them.
 
Like the one about the marine cryptogam expert (that's fungi) who was mistaken for a cryptogram expert (note the extra r in there) and whisked off to Bletchley park during the war - only to accidentally save the day (and possibly the war) when he was the only one who knew how to save and restore German codebooks retrieved from a sunken submarine. 
 
I read a good chunk of this, but then I was busy and set it to text-to-speech - which I really don't like usually, but I have this one posh english voice to use so I tried it out - and it actually worked pretty well. '
 
I suspect the audiobook version of this would be really great, if it's got a good narrator, and would probably get a whole 'nother star. In fact, I think I will look out for that, because there's SO much in this book, I am pretty sure I could read it another 3 times and still be finding new things.

111,0007209886,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54683202-clive-bevitt,3,A overview and history of the Natural History Museum. At times both a little dry and gossipy for me.
112,0007209886,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35553726-sara,3,"My college degree (Dutch: HBO) is in Cultural Heritage, but before they changed the name of the degree a couple of weeks before the graduation ceremony, it was museology. Basically, I've been trained for four years to work in a museum (any position really, but my preference will always be registration and documentation of collections). Even though the field I work in has nothing to do with cultural heritage or museums (I do software testing, at the moment for a logistics company), I still love it. So, any vacation my husband and I have, we visit many museums and cultural heritage sites, we watch programs and films about museums, and of course I read books about them. That's how I came to 'Dry Store Room No. 1: The Secret Life of the Natural History Museum' by Richard Fortey. Rochard Fortey is a palaeontologist specialized in the study of trilobites who has worked for the Natural History Museum in London since 1973. This book is his personal store-room of memories of all that time working in the museum. Together with explanations of the how and why of the many types of scientific research undertaken at the Natural History Museum, its history and its building he tells of the people he's worked with all these years. That makes this book a strange introduction to the specific kind of natural science undertaken at a museum (hint, it's a LOT of taxonomy) and a book filled with gossip about the strange characters that worked (under tenure) for the museum. Because of its focus on science (which is totally understandable because that is Fortey's branch of business in the museum) I was disappointed by the book. I had expected/wanted a book about the museum itself. About the collection, the collectors, the conservation, the curators and the exhibitions. Understandable from my point of view, because that is my personal interest in museums. Back in the winter of 2005/2006 my husband and I did an internship at the micro-palaeontological department of the Earth Studies department of the University of Utrecht. Our task was to register and if needed repackage the collection (of ancient mouse teeth basically) in a database system. We had a wonderful introduction into the many difficulties of taxonomy. We also met many of the types of characters (including the scientists who don't retire). We were able to look behind the screens at several natural history museum. And my husband went on to work in Mallorca with the Myotragus collection there in his next internship (a collection that is mentioned in this book). That made most of the parts in this book familiar, and a bit too much (I'd rather read about conservation than taxonomy). Another thing that put me off was Fortey's gossip about his colleagues. I get that he's trying to describe the quirks of scientists in a museum, but I found it unnecessary to make it so personal (working all your life on just beetles is quirky enough for me). Still, for the most part I can't fault Fortey for my disappointment with the book, it is a good, if somewhat rambling description and defense of the importance of scientific research in museums. Three out of five stars, but this will probably be higher if the reader likes to read about (natural) science more."
113,0007209886,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1756815-wendell,3,"I suppose it’s inevitable to compare Dry Storeroom to Douglas Preston’s Dinosaurs in the Attic, though Fortey doesn’t come out ahead in the competition. On the other hand, his Life: A Natural History of the First Four Billion Years of Life on Earth was such a fine book that Dry Storeroom had every reason to be just as engaging. It isn’t, though, and I’m still not entirely sure why. I suspect it’s because Fortey focuses almost exclusively on the scientists who work “behind the scenes” in his museum (or who “worked” there—quite a few of them are dead), and the recounting of old gossip and long-forgotten eccentricities and peccadilloes isn’t nearly as intriguing as Fortey perhaps intended it to be. Throughout, I wanted to hear more about the science itself, about the specimens, about (for crying out loud) trilobites, which are Fortey’s area of specialty. Though he does a decent job of explaining the basics of taxonomy and nomenclature, including a discussion of the conceptual upheaval of the entire endeavor that has been occasioned by our modern capacity to trace species relationships through DNA analysis, all of it feels a tad superficial. Fortey mentions the fact that modern science has challenged the very concept of “species,” but doesn’t ever quite arrive at the point. Other than alluding to the classic “lumpers vs. splitters” feud, meanwhile, he doesn’t speak much about what all of this means for paleontologists, who are forced to erect and defend species on the basis of entirely external characteristics (given that DNA is unavailable). In light of Fortey’s interesting discussion of the complete revolution that took place in the understanding of the taxonomy of just one species of common marine snail, Littorina, following genetic analysis, or the fact that some workers claim that as few as 40% of living species of Conus are valid, one wonders what hope there might be (to take one example) for fossil Conus, a morass if ever there was one—and that’s just a single gastropod in a single (admittedly huge) phylum. I assume that Fortey and his publisher made their editorial decisions deliberately to avoid overwhelming the scientifically handicapped, but I couldn’t help but feel that the dumbing-down sometimes went too far. Fortey takes several occasions to comment on the virtual extinction of the grand scientific enterprises that gave birth to our understanding of the systematics of living things, but he’s more wistful than angry about the way changing funding priorities and budget-slashing at universities and museums have made a victim of science. Anger, indeed, would be justified. Overall, Dry Storeroom is too long on anecdote and too short on analysis of the hard issues, and “popular” begins to bleed over into the territory of the run-of-the-mill. It’s a privilege to read Fortey; it’s just that I suspect he has much more compelling things to say."
114,0007209886,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9820302-sheila,3,"I really enjoyed this chatty and clever memoir of life in the Natural History Museum in London... until the end, when Fortey criticizes the Third World for its failure to properly collect and categorize the life forms that are rapidly disappearing from earth. To Fortey, this is an unspeakable tragedy, that something should die off before it can be named and classified. At this point the reader who knows the history of British colonialism has to slap palm against forehead and think, ""Hold on. Where did Britain (or the US, or France, etc) get the $$$ to build, staff, and stuff these enormous museums?"" The answer is, by stealing land, human beings, labor, resources and intellectual property from Indigenous peoples and the very Third World Fortey criticizes.Museums, of course, are wonderful places... or are they? The American Museum of Natural History in NYC delighted me when I was a child. I was ignorant of its racist history, that museums were trophy halls for the spoils of war and conquest. Museums displayed the new possessions (feathered, footed, and finned) of the ever-curious and acquisitive European. Little did I suspect that there were crypts in which European ""scientists"" could collect and study the remains of whomever they deemed to be less than human. (The heads of Native warriors killed in battle by the US cavalry were sometimes chopped off and sold to museums.) While I was mesmerized by the gorgeous dioramas and stuffed animals, I knew nothing of the white hunters who were busy decimating the African plains of ""game."" Aren't we lucky that the animals who fell to the industrial revolution left one valiant specimen (or two) for our viewing pleasure?A couple of years ago an article appeared which pointed out that Native Americans actually had a more accurate understanding of the nature of wolves than PhD scientists. Why? Well, even though they didn't know those all-important Latin names, the Native people observed wolves in the real world. They did not shoot, dissect, or stuff them or stick them in laboratories, zoos, or museums. Native cultures respect life, and do not look upon animals and plants and minerals as ""resources"" and commodities. I am not opposed to ""science,"" but Life forms would be better served if corporations stopped destroying the planet and impoverishing billions of people. If that happened. the animals and plants would not disappear, and children - not just privileged kids in imperial nations - could actually go outside and look at them in their natural environment. A living animal is always better than a stuffed one.And can we please get rid of that racist statue in front of the AMNH? The one of Teddy Roosevelt astride a horse, towering over an African walking beside him on one side and a Native American (also on foot) on his other side? The time of colonialism and its art and science is oveer.."
115,0007209886,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43477226-todd-stockslager,4,"Behind-the-scenes look at London's Natural History Museum is an interesting peak at the ""coalface""--Fortey's term for the daily work occurring beyond and below the public galleries--of museum science. Fortey describes the main work of the Museum, and its sister institutions in other countries, as systematic taxonomy--the attempt to exhaustively categorize and collect reference examples of each species of plant, animal, and mineral.In an era of hard-to-obtain research grants and declining public funding, Fortey defends this work as valuable for several reasons:--the need to find and identify species before they are destroyed by climate change, environmental destruction, or over-harvesting.--potential beneficial uses of unknown species for the biosphere, for example expanded use of natural predators as environmentally-safe pesticides.--helping future scientific endeavors by placing each species in its proper place in the taxonomy.--and ultimately, the pure aesthetic satisfaction of knowing everything we can know about the world in which we live and upon which we are dependent.Fortey spends time walking the reader virtually through the hidden corridors of each section of the Museum and using the discussion of the physical surroundings to talk in layman's terms about the science and the history of the science. Black-and-white photos in the pages with the text and color plates in the center of the book illustrate the surroundings and the collection as Fortey describes them.But most interesting are the people who work behind the scenes. The current and past scientists, curators, clerks, Keepers, Directors, and Trustees are a diverse, intelligent, and intensely fascinating lot. After describing some of the more legendary polymaths who seemed as if they would scarcely have time to indulge in their many interests, Fortey asks in wonderment: ""Are we lesser people today, or do we expect less of ourselves?""Of course the Museum also has its share of misfits, misanthropes, recluses, shysters, and just plain crazy people deep in the hallways behind the public galleries, and Fortey seems to take special glee in describing them, many of whom he knew personally from his 30-plus years in the corridors. He writes with an understated, decidedly British wit and language. I'm guessing I missed some of his best jokes as they glanced off my tin American ear, but unless you get the opportunity to tour the hallways (which he compares to the phantasmagorical and never-ending castle in the The Gormenghast Novels) with Fortey in person, this book will be your personal tour guide."
116,0007209886,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1385097-harry-rutherford,4,"Dry Store Room No. 1: The Secret Life of the Natural History Museum is about the behind-the-scenes work at the Natural History Museum in London. Whether you find that an appealing subject for a book depends, I suppose, on your feelings about museums and/or natural history; personally I found it irresistible.The public face of the museum — animatronic dinosaurs and overexcited schoolchildren — gives relatively little sense of the scientific work that goes on behind the scenes, all of which is centred on the museum's collection of biological specimens: pressed plants, trays of pinned beetles, drawers full of bird skins or fossils, jars of starfish in alcohol. The sheer scale of these collections is hard to comprehend: the museum holds over 70 million specimens. That means every person in the UK could be given one to take home and they'd still have enough left over for everyone in Sweden. 28 million of them are insects.The collections haven't been accumulated simply through an excess of acquisitiveness, although there must be some connection between the satisfaction biologists get from collecting beetles and other people's collections of stamps, obscure soul 45s or golf memorabilia. The point of the collection is that it is a vast reference library: if you find an earwig in Burma and you're not sure whether it's a new species, you can start by checking the literature; but if all else fails, the last resort is to go to a museum, open up the drawers full of earwigs, and start peering at them through a microscope.This kind of taxonomical work — preparing specimens, describing species, working out their relationships, publishing highly technical articles about it — might seem to be complete drudgery to an outsider; it is slow, careful, precise, unglamorous. But it obviously has a hold on people, because the book is full of people who spend decades working on some particular group of organisms, retire, and then keep coming in to the museum to continue their work in retirement. Fortey himself is apparently one of them, retired in 2006 but still working away at his trilobites.The books combines a history of the museum, examples of the work done there, anecdotes about characters on the staff (not surprisingly, perhaps, there have been a few notable eccentrics) and a passionate defence of taxonomy as a valuable field of study. It's well-written, frequently entertaining, pitched at the interested amateur, and I thoroughly enjoyed it."
117,0007209886,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15743853-don,4,"I found the title of this excellent book a little misleading - I came to it expecting it to be mostly about people and their lives - the 'scandals and skulduggery', as the blurb has it. It turned out to be a great deal more than that - it is mainly about the work of the Natural History Museum (which is mostly taxonomy and curation; the classification of the natural world - living, fossil and mineral - and the preservation of examples that illustrate it), why it is important, and how the perception of that importance has changed over the years. For anyone interested in natural history, and in the great national museums devoted to it, this is essential and fascinating reading. However, there is a strong undercurrent flowing through this book that makes it rather better, and more important, than might at first appear. In charting those changes in perception of the Museum's work, shown in part through the extraordinary cast of characters that have worked there, Fortey records the progressive changes in how its work has been funded (and, increasingly, not funded) - and the political forces that have driven those changes. He ends on an optimistic note, observing that the advent of the internet, the drive to digitise historical records and the movement to publish on-line have had the effect of 'democratising' taxonomy. He envisages a return to the era of the gifted amateur who develops expertise in a chosen corner of the living world, but now including many people in the developing world who in past times would have been excluded from such activities. These amateurs would be supported by professional taxonomists whose principal tool is DNA analysis, but who would also (Fortey thinks) exercise a benign oversight to prevent the whole enterprise developing chaotically, with a proliferation of inadequately defined species, many of which might be figments of the naturalist's imagination. There is some virtue in this vision - although I suspect there is also a good deal of wishful thinking. How much better it would be if government paymasters realised for themselves the value of the work done by museums - and other government scientific agencies - which in the long term is likely to be of greater lasting significance than the plethora of 'peer-reviewed' scientific papers by which the worth of scientists and their work is currently judged.

118,0007209886,http://goodreads.com/user/show/339857-cindy,4,"Themes: natural history, conservation, research, weird scienceSetting: The Natural History Museum in London, EnglandEver read books where they talk about going up to the British Museum for the day? Well, the British Museum is now the Natural History Museum (and a few other spin-offs) and Fortey takes the reader behind the scenes for an insider's view on what really goes on in such a huge museum.Fortey started his career as a biologist back when the museum was a slightly stuffier and more serious place, and only retired a few years ago, by which time the museum had become more of an attraction and began updating exhibits to attract paying guests. But the focus remains on the science. However, his book isn't really just about the history of the museum, its contributions to English scientific understanding and so on, but rather his own experiences, acquaintances, his explorations of all the hidden little corners of the vast building, and the gossip about the many folks who work there.And what juicy gossip there is! You wouldn't think that there would be much room for racy anecdotes among the dry and serious types who work at the museum, but wow, you would be so wrong. This and the Shakespeare book both convince me that gossip was much more interesting before it started revolving around which celebrity was sleeping with whom, which had an eating disorder, and who is feuding with whom.For his format, he starts with the collections of the museum, from mammals and plants and insects (lots of great stories there) to minerals and then the nuts and bolts of how such a place is run and what it takes to keep it going. The book is full of quirky personalities, which makes it so much more fun to read. He does stick his own opinions in there about evolution and religion, about the need to preserve every single species no matter how obscure, about the damage human beings are doing to the planet, about his political views, but he keeps those parts fairly brief and gets on with the more interesting stories of people he has met and colorful characters from the museum's past. I really enjoyed one. Recommended."
119,0007209886,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39215456-chris,2,"This book nearly defeated me on three separate occasions, I resisted the urge to put the book down and walk away only because I couldn't let it beat me. Don't make the same mistake I did, don't start the book.I should start off by saying the book reads less like a nonfiction book, more like a bland textbook. Dr. Fortey could have stopped after the first word and come up with a more accurate title. This is coming from someone who typically enjoys natural history and who gets excited about the prospect of sitting in a small, stuffy little office in the bowels of some old building.The book reads like a disjointed series of tidbits, sorted roughly into categories (Zoology, Botany, Entomology, etc.) and within those tidbits, Fortey frequently gets distracted and sidetracked, offering asides and sidebars that neither add anything nor help to make the main story any more interesting or intelligible. In addition, you're bombarded with an onslaught of names that go in one ear and out the other even though each only matters for the three or four paragraphs dedicated to each individual.The book drags on, each anecdote more similar to the one before. EL Harvishire, the diatom man, was digging in West Bromwich, Staffordshire, between 1909 and 1916 and published The Catalogue of the Freshwater Diatoms of the West Bromwich Manor House Garden Pond and he told me he found forty new species there.Change the names, add a few more sentences (likely about how EL Harvishire still comes in to the NHM every Monday and how technology will be the downfall of taxonomy), then copy and paste a few hundred times and you can be the author of Dry Storeroom No. 2!I should say however, there is a reason I'm giving Dr Storeroom No. 1 2 stars instead of one. Amongst the disjointed, uninteresting pieces, every one and a while, there is a gem, something interesting. While they only last a page or two. The sprinkling of them throughout helped me to power on. Would I recommend the book on this basis? No, but if you find yourself on a deserted island with nothing but this book, just know, theres something good in there."

There are a few bits of actual science sprinkled in, but mostly as a defense of the pure gathering of knowledge and its unpredictable practical application from time to time.The early perspective on technology does little to help. Perhaps in 2006 it was difficult to view large catalogs of images on one's device, but no one today would debate that information retrieval (whether text, image, or even video) is far more efficient on digital devices that dead tree forms. And the dismissal of modern digital engineers trying to build new hierarchies as just hackers playing with software feels somewhat luddite.Not sure this belonged in the science section of the library."
121,0007209886,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5514516-genetic-cuckoo,3,"This was a lovely collection of stories and anecdotes from behind the scenes at the Natural History Museum. It was fascinating to understand the changes of the museum over the years, the relocation of collections and changes in research and conservation within the museum. This book has been on my 'to read list' for years, after I attended a lecture by Richard Fortey at the Natural History Museum and had my copy signed. It is a fascinating book exploring the hidden world of working in a natural history museum. I liked how to book wandered around from topic to topic, like you are exploring the different hidden rooms and galleries, opening different doors to see what they contain. I enjoyed reading it, and it is something you can dip in and out of. Some chapters were more interesting than others, but there is likely to be something for everyone. I think this book would appeal to anyone interested in how museums are run or looking to work in a museum, or interested in nature and science, and how science communication has changed over the years. I would recommend this book to young adults who are interested in science and curation. "
122,0007209886,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5876945-ryan,2,"This book started off strong, with a behind the scenes tour from a veteran who has spent all his working life at this venerable institution. For natural history buffs it is obviously fascinating to be introduced to all the workings and characters, from the time the author joined in the 1960s and all the changes since. However as Fortey gets more into the details and nitty gritty of the cast and more obscure collections it is difficult to sustain interest in the goings on. I had to give it up for good nearing the final chapters after reading about the back stories of scores of ex-staff. I would highly recommend the first two or three chapters to anyone curious about what is beyond the public galleries. Naming and classifying organisms may seem boring but we cannot protect what we don't know and taxonomy is the basic foundation underlying conservation, and this book explains it all with passion."
123,0007209886,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2890743-mike-violano,5,"There is abundant dry British humor in the Dry Storeroom #1. Author Fortey, a trilobite scientist at the Natural History Museum in London, entertains with this behind the scenes history and secrets of the scholarship of the museum’s vast collections. From the 19th century rows of cabinets of curiosities to the more recent galleries that educate and entertain visitors of all ages there is much to learn in these chapters. Museum scientists uncover known and unknown species from the deep oceans, desert sands and find tiny critters under rotting logs. In the chapter on “Old World”, the author describes how and where primitive plants dating back to the dinosaurs have survived in greater numbers that animals. The most fun is found in the chapter on “Animalia” which is actually populated with past directors, department heads long departed and scores of trustees who range from royalty and heroes to imposters and villains. A book to savor and a perfect armchair escape for a summer’s day."

Loved how there was various chapters on cool science topics such as Botany, Geology, Biology and Entomology (that's bugs). I liked the back-of-house history of notable characters in the museums history, and a chronology of the museum's importance (and others like it) in the world's educational theater. I will have to note, that if you read the back cover you would think that this book was going to be about various old museum exhibits with their interesting stories full of scandal and intrigue. For the most part none of that happened.I give it five stars because it promotes Science, was well written and a nice glimpse into a career from someone who genuinely cared for what he was a part of. Richard Fortay was a charming author who represented Science professionals from all fields very well. Nice job!."

I was expecting a fascinating trip through the various treasures of the museum's Dry Storeroom #1. I didn't realize the title was simply a metaphor for the author's ""jumbled locker-room of memory."" The book did feature some of the museum's holdings, but it seemed more time was devoted to gossip about the peculiar habits of this scientist or that collector. Not that some of the stories weren't interesting -- I particularly liked the story of the expert on cryptogams (spore-producing plants) being recruited by the Minister of War to a team devoted to cracking cryptograms (ciphers) and ended providing an invaluable contribution specifically due to his experience with cryptogams.Another frequent topic in the book is taxonomy: its origins, its difficulties, and its importance. While I didn't mind the topic, I could certain imagine other readers skimming through a passage about a specimen that was originally in this genus but was later reclassified to that genus.Another reviewer compared the book to being at a party in conversation with someone droning on about something boring, who then suddenly says something interesting. This is an apt analogy. There were plenty of interesting bits, but there were an unfortunate number of less-than-interesting passages. Ultimately, while this book could have been so much more, it may be worth a look for anyone interested in what goes on behind the scenes at a museum."

Was similar to `Curators' which I read earlier this year about the Field Museum but was head & shoulders better in writing style & in keeping my interest (much as I love the Field Museum).

He talked more about what the people looked like, when I would rather have read about the work that was done behind the scenes or about any of the items stored within the museum.

This is a special kind of book. A marmite book. It's a memoir of a scientist, of a museum, and of a whole era too in a lot of ways. 
 
It manages to cram a history of Taxonomy, the science of classifying things, a personal memoir, a history of the radical changes a century wrought to science in general, particularly the effect Darwin had on all fields of biology, a complete history of the incredible British Museum of Natural History, a biography of Linnaeus, discussion on the value of the colonial legacy of botanical gardens, a history of the changes to the British civil service in the past 40 odd years, a grounding in basic latin and greek, and .... well you get the idea. In fact, I think all the things I listed are covered before the half way point. There's a lot of book in this book!
 
It's a bit of a dry read, unless you're really fascinated by that kind of thing which I am.
It's chock full of hilarious anecdotes too.  You just have to slog through a bit of science to find them.
 
Like the one about the marine cryptogam expert (that's fungi) who was mistaken for a cryptogram expert (note the extra r in there) and whisked off to Bletchley park during the war - only to accidentally save the day (and possibly the war) when he was the only one who knew how to save and restore German codebooks retrieved from a sunken submarine. 
 
I read a good chunk of this, but then I was busy and set it to text-to-speech - which I really don't like usually, but I have this one posh english voice to use so I tried it out - and it actually worked pretty well. '
 
I suspect the audiobook version of this would be really great, if it's got a good narrator, and would probably get a whole 'nother star. In fact, I think I will look out for that, because there's SO much in this book, I am pretty sure I could read it another 3 times and still be finding new things.

141,0007209886,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54683202-clive-bevitt,3,A overview and history of the Natural History Museum. At times both a little dry and gossipy for me.
142,0007209886,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35553726-sara,3,"My college degree (Dutch: HBO) is in Cultural Heritage, but before they changed the name of the degree a couple of weeks before the graduation ceremony, it was museology. Basically, I've been trained for four years to work in a museum (any position really, but my preference will always be registration and documentation of collections). Even though the field I work in has nothing to do with cultural heritage or museums (I do software testing, at the moment for a logistics company), I still love it. So, any vacation my husband and I have, we visit many museums and cultural heritage sites, we watch programs and films about museums, and of course I read books about them. That's how I came to 'Dry Store Room No. 1: The Secret Life of the Natural History Museum' by Richard Fortey. Rochard Fortey is a palaeontologist specialized in the study of trilobites who has worked for the Natural History Museum in London since 1973. This book is his personal store-room of memories of all that time working in the museum. Together with explanations of the how and why of the many types of scientific research undertaken at the Natural History Museum, its history and its building he tells of the people he's worked with all these years. That makes this book a strange introduction to the specific kind of natural science undertaken at a museum (hint, it's a LOT of taxonomy) and a book filled with gossip about the strange characters that worked (under tenure) for the museum. Because of its focus on science (which is totally understandable because that is Fortey's branch of business in the museum) I was disappointed by the book. I had expected/wanted a book about the museum itself. About the collection, the collectors, the conservation, the curators and the exhibitions. Understandable from my point of view, because that is my personal interest in museums. Back in the winter of 2005/2006 my husband and I did an internship at the micro-palaeontological department of the Earth Studies department of the University of Utrecht. Our task was to register and if needed repackage the collection (of ancient mouse teeth basically) in a database system. We had a wonderful introduction into the many difficulties of taxonomy. We also met many of the types of characters (including the scientists who don't retire). We were able to look behind the screens at several natural history museum. And my husband went on to work in Mallorca with the Myotragus collection there in his next internship (a collection that is mentioned in this book). That made most of the parts in this book familiar, and a bit too much (I'd rather read about conservation than taxonomy). Another thing that put me off was Fortey's gossip about his colleagues. I get that he's trying to describe the quirks of scientists in a museum, but I found it unnecessary to make it so personal (working all your life on just beetles is quirky enough for me). Still, for the most part I can't fault Fortey for my disappointment with the book, it is a good, if somewhat rambling description and defense of the importance of scientific research in museums. Three out of five stars, but this will probably be higher if the reader likes to read about (natural) science more."
143,0007209886,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1756815-wendell,3,"I suppose it’s inevitable to compare Dry Storeroom to Douglas Preston’s Dinosaurs in the Attic, though Fortey doesn’t come out ahead in the competition. On the other hand, his Life: A Natural History of the First Four Billion Years of Life on Earth was such a fine book that Dry Storeroom had every reason to be just as engaging. It isn’t, though, and I’m still not entirely sure why. I suspect it’s because Fortey focuses almost exclusively on the scientists who work “behind the scenes” in his museum (or who “worked” there—quite a few of them are dead), and the recounting of old gossip and long-forgotten eccentricities and peccadilloes isn’t nearly as intriguing as Fortey perhaps intended it to be. Throughout, I wanted to hear more about the science itself, about the specimens, about (for crying out loud) trilobites, which are Fortey’s area of specialty. Though he does a decent job of explaining the basics of taxonomy and nomenclature, including a discussion of the conceptual upheaval of the entire endeavor that has been occasioned by our modern capacity to trace species relationships through DNA analysis, all of it feels a tad superficial. Fortey mentions the fact that modern science has challenged the very concept of “species,” but doesn’t ever quite arrive at the point. Other than alluding to the classic “lumpers vs. splitters” feud, meanwhile, he doesn’t speak much about what all of this means for paleontologists, who are forced to erect and defend species on the basis of entirely external characteristics (given that DNA is unavailable). In light of Fortey’s interesting discussion of the complete revolution that took place in the understanding of the taxonomy of just one species of common marine snail, Littorina, following genetic analysis, or the fact that some workers claim that as few as 40% of living species of Conus are valid, one wonders what hope there might be (to take one example) for fossil Conus, a morass if ever there was one—and that’s just a single gastropod in a single (admittedly huge) phylum. I assume that Fortey and his publisher made their editorial decisions deliberately to avoid overwhelming the scientifically handicapped, but I couldn’t help but feel that the dumbing-down sometimes went too far. Fortey takes several occasions to comment on the virtual extinction of the grand scientific enterprises that gave birth to our understanding of the systematics of living things, but he’s more wistful than angry about the way changing funding priorities and budget-slashing at universities and museums have made a victim of science. Anger, indeed, would be justified. Overall, Dry Storeroom is too long on anecdote and too short on analysis of the hard issues, and “popular” begins to bleed over into the territory of the run-of-the-mill. It’s a privilege to read Fortey; it’s just that I suspect he has much more compelling things to say."
144,0007209886,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9820302-sheila,3,"I really enjoyed this chatty and clever memoir of life in the Natural History Museum in London... until the end, when Fortey criticizes the Third World for its failure to properly collect and categorize the life forms that are rapidly disappearing from earth. To Fortey, this is an unspeakable tragedy, that something should die off before it can be named and classified. At this point the reader who knows the history of British colonialism has to slap palm against forehead and think, ""Hold on. Where did Britain (or the US, or France, etc) get the $$$ to build, staff, and stuff these enormous museums?"" The answer is, by stealing land, human beings, labor, resources and intellectual property from Indigenous peoples and the very Third World Fortey criticizes.Museums, of course, are wonderful places... or are they? The American Museum of Natural History in NYC delighted me when I was a child. I was ignorant of its racist history, that museums were trophy halls for the spoils of war and conquest. Museums displayed the new possessions (feathered, footed, and finned) of the ever-curious and acquisitive European. Little did I suspect that there were crypts in which European ""scientists"" could collect and study the remains of whomever they deemed to be less than human. (The heads of Native warriors killed in battle by the US cavalry were sometimes chopped off and sold to museums.) While I was mesmerized by the gorgeous dioramas and stuffed animals, I knew nothing of the white hunters who were busy decimating the African plains of ""game."" Aren't we lucky that the animals who fell to the industrial revolution left one valiant specimen (or two) for our viewing pleasure?A couple of years ago an article appeared which pointed out that Native Americans actually had a more accurate understanding of the nature of wolves than PhD scientists. Why? Well, even though they didn't know those all-important Latin names, the Native people observed wolves in the real world. They did not shoot, dissect, or stuff them or stick them in laboratories, zoos, or museums. Native cultures respect life, and do not look upon animals and plants and minerals as ""resources"" and commodities. I am not opposed to ""science,"" but Life forms would be better served if corporations stopped destroying the planet and impoverishing billions of people. If that happened. the animals and plants would not disappear, and children - not just privileged kids in imperial nations - could actually go outside and look at them in their natural environment. A living animal is always better than a stuffed one.And can we please get rid of that racist statue in front of the AMNH? The one of Teddy Roosevelt astride a horse, towering over an African walking beside him on one side and a Native American (also on foot) on his other side? The time of colonialism and its art and science is oveer.."
145,0007209886,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43477226-todd-stockslager,4,"Behind-the-scenes look at London's Natural History Museum is an interesting peak at the ""coalface""--Fortey's term for the daily work occurring beyond and below the public galleries--of museum science. Fortey describes the main work of the Museum, and its sister institutions in other countries, as systematic taxonomy--the attempt to exhaustively categorize and collect reference examples of each species of plant, animal, and mineral.In an era of hard-to-obtain research grants and declining public funding, Fortey defends this work as valuable for several reasons:--the need to find and identify species before they are destroyed by climate change, environmental destruction, or over-harvesting.--potential beneficial uses of unknown species for the biosphere, for example expanded use of natural predators as environmentally-safe pesticides.--helping future scientific endeavors by placing each species in its proper place in the taxonomy.--and ultimately, the pure aesthetic satisfaction of knowing everything we can know about the world in which we live and upon which we are dependent.Fortey spends time walking the reader virtually through the hidden corridors of each section of the Museum and using the discussion of the physical surroundings to talk in layman's terms about the science and the history of the science. Black-and-white photos in the pages with the text and color plates in the center of the book illustrate the surroundings and the collection as Fortey describes them.But most interesting are the people who work behind the scenes. The current and past scientists, curators, clerks, Keepers, Directors, and Trustees are a diverse, intelligent, and intensely fascinating lot. After describing some of the more legendary polymaths who seemed as if they would scarcely have time to indulge in their many interests, Fortey asks in wonderment: ""Are we lesser people today, or do we expect less of ourselves?""Of course the Museum also has its share of misfits, misanthropes, recluses, shysters, and just plain crazy people deep in the hallways behind the public galleries, and Fortey seems to take special glee in describing them, many of whom he knew personally from his 30-plus years in the corridors. He writes with an understated, decidedly British wit and language. I'm guessing I missed some of his best jokes as they glanced off my tin American ear, but unless you get the opportunity to tour the hallways (which he compares to the phantasmagorical and never-ending castle in the The Gormenghast Novels) with Fortey in person, this book will be your personal tour guide."
146,0007209886,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1385097-harry-rutherford,4,"Dry Store Room No. 1: The Secret Life of the Natural History Museum is about the behind-the-scenes work at the Natural History Museum in London. Whether you find that an appealing subject for a book depends, I suppose, on your feelings about museums and/or natural history; personally I found it irresistible.The public face of the museum — animatronic dinosaurs and overexcited schoolchildren — gives relatively little sense of the scientific work that goes on behind the scenes, all of which is centred on the museum's collection of biological specimens: pressed plants, trays of pinned beetles, drawers full of bird skins or fossils, jars of starfish in alcohol. The sheer scale of these collections is hard to comprehend: the museum holds over 70 million specimens. That means every person in the UK could be given one to take home and they'd still have enough left over for everyone in Sweden. 28 million of them are insects.The collections haven't been accumulated simply through an excess of acquisitiveness, although there must be some connection between the satisfaction biologists get from collecting beetles and other people's collections of stamps, obscure soul 45s or golf memorabilia. The point of the collection is that it is a vast reference library: if you find an earwig in Burma and you're not sure whether it's a new species, you can start by checking the literature; but if all else fails, the last resort is to go to a museum, open up the drawers full of earwigs, and start peering at them through a microscope.This kind of taxonomical work — preparing specimens, describing species, working out their relationships, publishing highly technical articles about it — might seem to be complete drudgery to an outsider; it is slow, careful, precise, unglamorous. But it obviously has a hold on people, because the book is full of people who spend decades working on some particular group of organisms, retire, and then keep coming in to the museum to continue their work in retirement. Fortey himself is apparently one of them, retired in 2006 but still working away at his trilobites.The books combines a history of the museum, examples of the work done there, anecdotes about characters on the staff (not surprisingly, perhaps, there have been a few notable eccentrics) and a passionate defence of taxonomy as a valuable field of study. It's well-written, frequently entertaining, pitched at the interested amateur, and I thoroughly enjoyed it."
147,0007209886,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15743853-don,4,"I found the title of this excellent book a little misleading - I came to it expecting it to be mostly about people and their lives - the 'scandals and skulduggery', as the blurb has it. It turned out to be a great deal more than that - it is mainly about the work of the Natural History Museum (which is mostly taxonomy and curation; the classification of the natural world - living, fossil and mineral - and the preservation of examples that illustrate it), why it is important, and how the perception of that importance has changed over the years. For anyone interested in natural history, and in the great national museums devoted to it, this is essential and fascinating reading. However, there is a strong undercurrent flowing through this book that makes it rather better, and more important, than might at first appear. In charting those changes in perception of the Museum's work, shown in part through the extraordinary cast of characters that have worked there, Fortey records the progressive changes in how its work has been funded (and, increasingly, not funded) - and the political forces that have driven those changes. He ends on an optimistic note, observing that the advent of the internet, the drive to digitise historical records and the movement to publish on-line have had the effect of 'democratising' taxonomy. He envisages a return to the era of the gifted amateur who develops expertise in a chosen corner of the living world, but now including many people in the developing world who in past times would have been excluded from such activities. These amateurs would be supported by professional taxonomists whose principal tool is DNA analysis, but who would also (Fortey thinks) exercise a benign oversight to prevent the whole enterprise developing chaotically, with a proliferation of inadequately defined species, many of which might be figments of the naturalist's imagination. There is some virtue in this vision - although I suspect there is also a good deal of wishful thinking. How much better it would be if government paymasters realised for themselves the value of the work done by museums - and other government scientific agencies - which in the long term is likely to be of greater lasting significance than the plethora of 'peer-reviewed' scientific papers by which the worth of scientists and their work is currently judged.

148,0007209886,http://goodreads.com/user/show/339857-cindy,4,"Themes: natural history, conservation, research, weird scienceSetting: The Natural History Museum in London, EnglandEver read books where they talk about going up to the British Museum for the day? Well, the British Museum is now the Natural History Museum (and a few other spin-offs) and Fortey takes the reader behind the scenes for an insider's view on what really goes on in such a huge museum.Fortey started his career as a biologist back when the museum was a slightly stuffier and more serious place, and only retired a few years ago, by which time the museum had become more of an attraction and began updating exhibits to attract paying guests. But the focus remains on the science. However, his book isn't really just about the history of the museum, its contributions to English scientific understanding and so on, but rather his own experiences, acquaintances, his explorations of all the hidden little corners of the vast building, and the gossip about the many folks who work there.And what juicy gossip there is! You wouldn't think that there would be much room for racy anecdotes among the dry and serious types who work at the museum, but wow, you would be so wrong. This and the Shakespeare book both convince me that gossip was much more interesting before it started revolving around which celebrity was sleeping with whom, which had an eating disorder, and who is feuding with whom.For his format, he starts with the collections of the museum, from mammals and plants and insects (lots of great stories there) to minerals and then the nuts and bolts of how such a place is run and what it takes to keep it going. The book is full of quirky personalities, which makes it so much more fun to read. He does stick his own opinions in there about evolution and religion, about the need to preserve every single species no matter how obscure, about the damage human beings are doing to the planet, about his political views, but he keeps those parts fairly brief and gets on with the more interesting stories of people he has met and colorful characters from the museum's past. I really enjoyed one. Recommended."
149,0007209886,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39215456-chris,2,"This book nearly defeated me on three separate occasions, I resisted the urge to put the book down and walk away only because I couldn't let it beat me. Don't make the same mistake I did, don't start the book.I should start off by saying the book reads less like a nonfiction book, more like a bland textbook. Dr. Fortey could have stopped after the first word and come up with a more accurate title. This is coming from someone who typically enjoys natural history and who gets excited about the prospect of sitting in a small, stuffy little office in the bowels of some old building.The book reads like a disjointed series of tidbits, sorted roughly into categories (Zoology, Botany, Entomology, etc.) and within those tidbits, Fortey frequently gets distracted and sidetracked, offering asides and sidebars that neither add anything nor help to make the main story any more interesting or intelligible. In addition, you're bombarded with an onslaught of names that go in one ear and out the other even though each only matters for the three or four paragraphs dedicated to each individual.The book drags on, each anecdote more similar to the one before. EL Harvishire, the diatom man, was digging in West Bromwich, Staffordshire, between 1909 and 1916 and published The Catalogue of the Freshwater Diatoms of the West Bromwich Manor House Garden Pond and he told me he found forty new species there.Change the names, add a few more sentences (likely about how EL Harvishire still comes in to the NHM every Monday and how technology will be the downfall of taxonomy), then copy and paste a few hundred times and you can be the author of Dry Storeroom No. 2!I should say however, there is a reason I'm giving Dr Storeroom No. 1 2 stars instead of one. Amongst the disjointed, uninteresting pieces, every one and a while, there is a gem, something interesting. While they only last a page or two. The sprinkling of them throughout helped me to power on. Would I recommend the book on this basis? No, but if you find yourself on a deserted island with nothing but this book, just know, theres something good in there."

There are a few bits of actual science sprinkled in, but mostly as a defense of the pure gathering of knowledge and its unpredictable practical application from time to time.The early perspective on technology does little to help. Perhaps in 2006 it was difficult to view large catalogs of images on one's device, but no one today would debate that information retrieval (whether text, image, or even video) is far more efficient on digital devices that dead tree forms. And the dismissal of modern digital engineers trying to build new hierarchies as just hackers playing with software feels somewhat luddite.Not sure this belonged in the science section of the library."
151,0007209886,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5514516-genetic-cuckoo,3,"This was a lovely collection of stories and anecdotes from behind the scenes at the Natural History Museum. It was fascinating to understand the changes of the museum over the years, the relocation of collections and changes in research and conservation within the museum. This book has been on my 'to read list' for years, after I attended a lecture by Richard Fortey at the Natural History Museum and had my copy signed. It is a fascinating book exploring the hidden world of working in a natural history museum. I liked how to book wandered around from topic to topic, like you are exploring the different hidden rooms and galleries, opening different doors to see what they contain. I enjoyed reading it, and it is something you can dip in and out of. Some chapters were more interesting than others, but there is likely to be something for everyone. I think this book would appeal to anyone interested in how museums are run or looking to work in a museum, or interested in nature and science, and how science communication has changed over the years. I would recommend this book to young adults who are interested in science and curation. "
152,0007209886,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5876945-ryan,2,"This book started off strong, with a behind the scenes tour from a veteran who has spent all his working life at this venerable institution. For natural history buffs it is obviously fascinating to be introduced to all the workings and characters, from the time the author joined in the 1960s and all the changes since. However as Fortey gets more into the details and nitty gritty of the cast and more obscure collections it is difficult to sustain interest in the goings on. I had to give it up for good nearing the final chapters after reading about the back stories of scores of ex-staff. I would highly recommend the first two or three chapters to anyone curious about what is beyond the public galleries. Naming and classifying organisms may seem boring but we cannot protect what we don't know and taxonomy is the basic foundation underlying conservation, and this book explains it all with passion."
153,0007209886,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2890743-mike-violano,5,"There is abundant dry British humor in the Dry Storeroom #1. Author Fortey, a trilobite scientist at the Natural History Museum in London, entertains with this behind the scenes history and secrets of the scholarship of the museum’s vast collections. From the 19th century rows of cabinets of curiosities to the more recent galleries that educate and entertain visitors of all ages there is much to learn in these chapters. Museum scientists uncover known and unknown species from the deep oceans, desert sands and find tiny critters under rotting logs. In the chapter on “Old World”, the author describes how and where primitive plants dating back to the dinosaurs have survived in greater numbers that animals. The most fun is found in the chapter on “Animalia” which is actually populated with past directors, department heads long departed and scores of trustees who range from royalty and heroes to imposters and villains. A book to savor and a perfect armchair escape for a summer’s day."

Loved how there was various chapters on cool science topics such as Botany, Geology, Biology and Entomology (that's bugs). I liked the back-of-house history of notable characters in the museums history, and a chronology of the museum's importance (and others like it) in the world's educational theater. I will have to note, that if you read the back cover you would think that this book was going to be about various old museum exhibits with their interesting stories full of scandal and intrigue. For the most part none of that happened.I give it five stars because it promotes Science, was well written and a nice glimpse into a career from someone who genuinely cared for what he was a part of. Richard Fortay was a charming author who represented Science professionals from all fields very well. Nice job!."

I was expecting a fascinating trip through the various treasures of the museum's Dry Storeroom #1. I didn't realize the title was simply a metaphor for the author's ""jumbled locker-room of memory."" The book did feature some of the museum's holdings, but it seemed more time was devoted to gossip about the peculiar habits of this scientist or that collector. Not that some of the stories weren't interesting -- I particularly liked the story of the expert on cryptogams (spore-producing plants) being recruited by the Minister of War to a team devoted to cracking cryptograms (ciphers) and ended providing an invaluable contribution specifically due to his experience with cryptogams.Another frequent topic in the book is taxonomy: its origins, its difficulties, and its importance. While I didn't mind the topic, I could certain imagine other readers skimming through a passage about a specimen that was originally in this genus but was later reclassified to that genus.Another reviewer compared the book to being at a party in conversation with someone droning on about something boring, who then suddenly says something interesting. This is an apt analogy. There were plenty of interesting bits, but there were an unfortunate number of less-than-interesting passages. Ultimately, while this book could have been so much more, it may be worth a look for anyone interested in what goes on behind the scenes at a museum."

HahaThis book was really fascinating. I've just always dreamed of working in a museum, even as my focus and interests have changed, so it was really cool to just read about it and get a little peak into that life."

Partly it's because so little of the book was actually about ""Dry Store Room No. 1"" (which is where they keep all the oddities) and partly it's because the author's voice didn't work for me -- he is too wealthy, too privileged, and perhaps too English (in that particular way the English have of celebrating amateurs) for me.

This is a special kind of book. A marmite book. It's a memoir of a scientist, of a museum, and of a whole era too in a lot of ways. 
 
It manages to cram a history of Taxonomy, the science of classifying things, a personal memoir, a history of the radical changes a century wrought to science in general, particularly the effect Darwin had on all fields of biology, a complete history of the incredible British Museum of Natural History, a biography of Linnaeus, discussion on the value of the colonial legacy of botanical gardens, a history of the changes to the British civil service in the past 40 odd years, a grounding in basic latin and greek, and .... well you get the idea. In fact, I think all the things I listed are covered before the half way point. There's a lot of book in this book!
 
It's a bit of a dry read, unless you're really fascinated by that kind of thing which I am.
It's chock full of hilarious anecdotes too.  You just have to slog through a bit of science to find them.
 
Like the one about the marine cryptogam expert (that's fungi) who was mistaken for a cryptogram expert (note the extra r in there) and whisked off to Bletchley park during the war - only to accidentally save the day (and possibly the war) when he was the only one who knew how to save and restore German codebooks retrieved from a sunken submarine. 
 
I read a good chunk of this, but then I was busy and set it to text-to-speech - which I really don't like usually, but I have this one posh english voice to use so I tried it out - and it actually worked pretty well. '
 
I suspect the audiobook version of this would be really great, if it's got a good narrator, and would probably get a whole 'nother star. In fact, I think I will look out for that, because there's SO much in this book, I am pretty sure I could read it another 3 times and still be finding new things.

171,0007209886,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54683202-clive-bevitt,3,A overview and history of the Natural History Museum. At times both a little dry and gossipy for me.
172,0007209886,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35553726-sara,3,"My college degree (Dutch: HBO) is in Cultural Heritage, but before they changed the name of the degree a couple of weeks before the graduation ceremony, it was museology. Basically, I've been trained for four years to work in a museum (any position really, but my preference will always be registration and documentation of collections). Even though the field I work in has nothing to do with cultural heritage or museums (I do software testing, at the moment for a logistics company), I still love it. So, any vacation my husband and I have, we visit many museums and cultural heritage sites, we watch programs and films about museums, and of course I read books about them. That's how I came to 'Dry Store Room No. 1: The Secret Life of the Natural History Museum' by Richard Fortey. Rochard Fortey is a palaeontologist specialized in the study of trilobites who has worked for the Natural History Museum in London since 1973. This book is his personal store-room of memories of all that time working in the museum. Together with explanations of the how and why of the many types of scientific research undertaken at the Natural History Museum, its history and its building he tells of the people he's worked with all these years. That makes this book a strange introduction to the specific kind of natural science undertaken at a museum (hint, it's a LOT of taxonomy) and a book filled with gossip about the strange characters that worked (under tenure) for the museum. Because of its focus on science (which is totally understandable because that is Fortey's branch of business in the museum) I was disappointed by the book. I had expected/wanted a book about the museum itself. About the collection, the collectors, the conservation, the curators and the exhibitions. Understandable from my point of view, because that is my personal interest in museums. Back in the winter of 2005/2006 my husband and I did an internship at the micro-palaeontological department of the Earth Studies department of the University of Utrecht. Our task was to register and if needed repackage the collection (of ancient mouse teeth basically) in a database system. We had a wonderful introduction into the many difficulties of taxonomy. We also met many of the types of characters (including the scientists who don't retire). We were able to look behind the screens at several natural history museum. And my husband went on to work in Mallorca with the Myotragus collection there in his next internship (a collection that is mentioned in this book). That made most of the parts in this book familiar, and a bit too much (I'd rather read about conservation than taxonomy). Another thing that put me off was Fortey's gossip about his colleagues. I get that he's trying to describe the quirks of scientists in a museum, but I found it unnecessary to make it so personal (working all your life on just beetles is quirky enough for me). Still, for the most part I can't fault Fortey for my disappointment with the book, it is a good, if somewhat rambling description and defense of the importance of scientific research in museums. Three out of five stars, but this will probably be higher if the reader likes to read about (natural) science more."
173,0007209886,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1756815-wendell,3,"I suppose it’s inevitable to compare Dry Storeroom to Douglas Preston’s Dinosaurs in the Attic, though Fortey doesn’t come out ahead in the competition. On the other hand, his Life: A Natural History of the First Four Billion Years of Life on Earth was such a fine book that Dry Storeroom had every reason to be just as engaging. It isn’t, though, and I’m still not entirely sure why. I suspect it’s because Fortey focuses almost exclusively on the scientists who work “behind the scenes” in his museum (or who “worked” there—quite a few of them are dead), and the recounting of old gossip and long-forgotten eccentricities and peccadilloes isn’t nearly as intriguing as Fortey perhaps intended it to be. Throughout, I wanted to hear more about the science itself, about the specimens, about (for crying out loud) trilobites, which are Fortey’s area of specialty. Though he does a decent job of explaining the basics of taxonomy and nomenclature, including a discussion of the conceptual upheaval of the entire endeavor that has been occasioned by our modern capacity to trace species relationships through DNA analysis, all of it feels a tad superficial. Fortey mentions the fact that modern science has challenged the very concept of “species,” but doesn’t ever quite arrive at the point. Other than alluding to the classic “lumpers vs. splitters” feud, meanwhile, he doesn’t speak much about what all of this means for paleontologists, who are forced to erect and defend species on the basis of entirely external characteristics (given that DNA is unavailable). In light of Fortey’s interesting discussion of the complete revolution that took place in the understanding of the taxonomy of just one species of common marine snail, Littorina, following genetic analysis, or the fact that some workers claim that as few as 40% of living species of Conus are valid, one wonders what hope there might be (to take one example) for fossil Conus, a morass if ever there was one—and that’s just a single gastropod in a single (admittedly huge) phylum. I assume that Fortey and his publisher made their editorial decisions deliberately to avoid overwhelming the scientifically handicapped, but I couldn’t help but feel that the dumbing-down sometimes went too far. Fortey takes several occasions to comment on the virtual extinction of the grand scientific enterprises that gave birth to our understanding of the systematics of living things, but he’s more wistful than angry about the way changing funding priorities and budget-slashing at universities and museums have made a victim of science. Anger, indeed, would be justified. Overall, Dry Storeroom is too long on anecdote and too short on analysis of the hard issues, and “popular” begins to bleed over into the territory of the run-of-the-mill. It’s a privilege to read Fortey; it’s just that I suspect he has much more compelling things to say."
174,0007209886,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9820302-sheila,3,"I really enjoyed this chatty and clever memoir of life in the Natural History Museum in London... until the end, when Fortey criticizes the Third World for its failure to properly collect and categorize the life forms that are rapidly disappearing from earth. To Fortey, this is an unspeakable tragedy, that something should die off before it can be named and classified. At this point the reader who knows the history of British colonialism has to slap palm against forehead and think, ""Hold on. Where did Britain (or the US, or France, etc) get the $$$ to build, staff, and stuff these enormous museums?"" The answer is, by stealing land, human beings, labor, resources and intellectual property from Indigenous peoples and the very Third World Fortey criticizes.Museums, of course, are wonderful places... or are they? The American Museum of Natural History in NYC delighted me when I was a child. I was ignorant of its racist history, that museums were trophy halls for the spoils of war and conquest. Museums displayed the new possessions (feathered, footed, and finned) of the ever-curious and acquisitive European. Little did I suspect that there were crypts in which European ""scientists"" could collect and study the remains of whomever they deemed to be less than human. (The heads of Native warriors killed in battle by the US cavalry were sometimes chopped off and sold to museums.) While I was mesmerized by the gorgeous dioramas and stuffed animals, I knew nothing of the white hunters who were busy decimating the African plains of ""game."" Aren't we lucky that the animals who fell to the industrial revolution left one valiant specimen (or two) for our viewing pleasure?A couple of years ago an article appeared which pointed out that Native Americans actually had a more accurate understanding of the nature of wolves than PhD scientists. Why? Well, even though they didn't know those all-important Latin names, the Native people observed wolves in the real world. They did not shoot, dissect, or stuff them or stick them in laboratories, zoos, or museums. Native cultures respect life, and do not look upon animals and plants and minerals as ""resources"" and commodities. I am not opposed to ""science,"" but Life forms would be better served if corporations stopped destroying the planet and impoverishing billions of people. If that happened. the animals and plants would not disappear, and children - not just privileged kids in imperial nations - could actually go outside and look at them in their natural environment. A living animal is always better than a stuffed one.And can we please get rid of that racist statue in front of the AMNH? The one of Teddy Roosevelt astride a horse, towering over an African walking beside him on one side and a Native American (also on foot) on his other side? The time of colonialism and its art and science is oveer.."
175,0007209886,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43477226-todd-stockslager,4,"Behind-the-scenes look at London's Natural History Museum is an interesting peak at the ""coalface""--Fortey's term for the daily work occurring beyond and below the public galleries--of museum science. Fortey describes the main work of the Museum, and its sister institutions in other countries, as systematic taxonomy--the attempt to exhaustively categorize and collect reference examples of each species of plant, animal, and mineral.In an era of hard-to-obtain research grants and declining public funding, Fortey defends this work as valuable for several reasons:--the need to find and identify species before they are destroyed by climate change, environmental destruction, or over-harvesting.--potential beneficial uses of unknown species for the biosphere, for example expanded use of natural predators as environmentally-safe pesticides.--helping future scientific endeavors by placing each species in its proper place in the taxonomy.--and ultimately, the pure aesthetic satisfaction of knowing everything we can know about the world in which we live and upon which we are dependent.Fortey spends time walking the reader virtually through the hidden corridors of each section of the Museum and using the discussion of the physical surroundings to talk in layman's terms about the science and the history of the science. Black-and-white photos in the pages with the text and color plates in the center of the book illustrate the surroundings and the collection as Fortey describes them.But most interesting are the people who work behind the scenes. The current and past scientists, curators, clerks, Keepers, Directors, and Trustees are a diverse, intelligent, and intensely fascinating lot. After describing some of the more legendary polymaths who seemed as if they would scarcely have time to indulge in their many interests, Fortey asks in wonderment: ""Are we lesser people today, or do we expect less of ourselves?""Of course the Museum also has its share of misfits, misanthropes, recluses, shysters, and just plain crazy people deep in the hallways behind the public galleries, and Fortey seems to take special glee in describing them, many of whom he knew personally from his 30-plus years in the corridors. He writes with an understated, decidedly British wit and language. I'm guessing I missed some of his best jokes as they glanced off my tin American ear, but unless you get the opportunity to tour the hallways (which he compares to the phantasmagorical and never-ending castle in the The Gormenghast Novels) with Fortey in person, this book will be your personal tour guide."
176,0007209886,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1385097-harry-rutherford,4,"Dry Store Room No. 1: The Secret Life of the Natural History Museum is about the behind-the-scenes work at the Natural History Museum in London. Whether you find that an appealing subject for a book depends, I suppose, on your feelings about museums and/or natural history; personally I found it irresistible.The public face of the museum — animatronic dinosaurs and overexcited schoolchildren — gives relatively little sense of the scientific work that goes on behind the scenes, all of which is centred on the museum's collection of biological specimens: pressed plants, trays of pinned beetles, drawers full of bird skins or fossils, jars of starfish in alcohol. The sheer scale of these collections is hard to comprehend: the museum holds over 70 million specimens. That means every person in the UK could be given one to take home and they'd still have enough left over for everyone in Sweden. 28 million of them are insects.The collections haven't been accumulated simply through an excess of acquisitiveness, although there must be some connection between the satisfaction biologists get from collecting beetles and other people's collections of stamps, obscure soul 45s or golf memorabilia. The point of the collection is that it is a vast reference library: if you find an earwig in Burma and you're not sure whether it's a new species, you can start by checking the literature; but if all else fails, the last resort is to go to a museum, open up the drawers full of earwigs, and start peering at them through a microscope.This kind of taxonomical work — preparing specimens, describing species, working out their relationships, publishing highly technical articles about it — might seem to be complete drudgery to an outsider; it is slow, careful, precise, unglamorous. But it obviously has a hold on people, because the book is full of people who spend decades working on some particular group of organisms, retire, and then keep coming in to the museum to continue their work in retirement. Fortey himself is apparently one of them, retired in 2006 but still working away at his trilobites.The books combines a history of the museum, examples of the work done there, anecdotes about characters on the staff (not surprisingly, perhaps, there have been a few notable eccentrics) and a passionate defence of taxonomy as a valuable field of study. It's well-written, frequently entertaining, pitched at the interested amateur, and I thoroughly enjoyed it."
177,0007209886,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15743853-don,4,"I found the title of this excellent book a little misleading - I came to it expecting it to be mostly about people and their lives - the 'scandals and skulduggery', as the blurb has it. It turned out to be a great deal more than that - it is mainly about the work of the Natural History Museum (which is mostly taxonomy and curation; the classification of the natural world - living, fossil and mineral - and the preservation of examples that illustrate it), why it is important, and how the perception of that importance has changed over the years. For anyone interested in natural history, and in the great national museums devoted to it, this is essential and fascinating reading. However, there is a strong undercurrent flowing through this book that makes it rather better, and more important, than might at first appear. In charting those changes in perception of the Museum's work, shown in part through the extraordinary cast of characters that have worked there, Fortey records the progressive changes in how its work has been funded (and, increasingly, not funded) - and the political forces that have driven those changes. He ends on an optimistic note, observing that the advent of the internet, the drive to digitise historical records and the movement to publish on-line have had the effect of 'democratising' taxonomy. He envisages a return to the era of the gifted amateur who develops expertise in a chosen corner of the living world, but now including many people in the developing world who in past times would have been excluded from such activities. These amateurs would be supported by professional taxonomists whose principal tool is DNA analysis, but who would also (Fortey thinks) exercise a benign oversight to prevent the whole enterprise developing chaotically, with a proliferation of inadequately defined species, many of which might be figments of the naturalist's imagination. There is some virtue in this vision - although I suspect there is also a good deal of wishful thinking. How much better it would be if government paymasters realised for themselves the value of the work done by museums - and other government scientific agencies - which in the long term is likely to be of greater lasting significance than the plethora of 'peer-reviewed' scientific papers by which the worth of scientists and their work is currently judged.

178,0007209886,http://goodreads.com/user/show/339857-cindy,4,"Themes: natural history, conservation, research, weird scienceSetting: The Natural History Museum in London, EnglandEver read books where they talk about going up to the British Museum for the day? Well, the British Museum is now the Natural History Museum (and a few other spin-offs) and Fortey takes the reader behind the scenes for an insider's view on what really goes on in such a huge museum.Fortey started his career as a biologist back when the museum was a slightly stuffier and more serious place, and only retired a few years ago, by which time the museum had become more of an attraction and began updating exhibits to attract paying guests. But the focus remains on the science. However, his book isn't really just about the history of the museum, its contributions to English scientific understanding and so on, but rather his own experiences, acquaintances, his explorations of all the hidden little corners of the vast building, and the gossip about the many folks who work there.And what juicy gossip there is! You wouldn't think that there would be much room for racy anecdotes among the dry and serious types who work at the museum, but wow, you would be so wrong. This and the Shakespeare book both convince me that gossip was much more interesting before it started revolving around which celebrity was sleeping with whom, which had an eating disorder, and who is feuding with whom.For his format, he starts with the collections of the museum, from mammals and plants and insects (lots of great stories there) to minerals and then the nuts and bolts of how such a place is run and what it takes to keep it going. The book is full of quirky personalities, which makes it so much more fun to read. He does stick his own opinions in there about evolution and religion, about the need to preserve every single species no matter how obscure, about the damage human beings are doing to the planet, about his political views, but he keeps those parts fairly brief and gets on with the more interesting stories of people he has met and colorful characters from the museum's past. I really enjoyed one. Recommended."
179,0007209886,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39215456-chris,2,"This book nearly defeated me on three separate occasions, I resisted the urge to put the book down and walk away only because I couldn't let it beat me. Don't make the same mistake I did, don't start the book.I should start off by saying the book reads less like a nonfiction book, more like a bland textbook. Dr. Fortey could have stopped after the first word and come up with a more accurate title. This is coming from someone who typically enjoys natural history and who gets excited about the prospect of sitting in a small, stuffy little office in the bowels of some old building.The book reads like a disjointed series of tidbits, sorted roughly into categories (Zoology, Botany, Entomology, etc.) and within those tidbits, Fortey frequently gets distracted and sidetracked, offering asides and sidebars that neither add anything nor help to make the main story any more interesting or intelligible. In addition, you're bombarded with an onslaught of names that go in one ear and out the other even though each only matters for the three or four paragraphs dedicated to each individual.The book drags on, each anecdote more similar to the one before. EL Harvishire, the diatom man, was digging in West Bromwich, Staffordshire, between 1909 and 1916 and published The Catalogue of the Freshwater Diatoms of the West Bromwich Manor House Garden Pond and he told me he found forty new species there.Change the names, add a few more sentences (likely about how EL Harvishire still comes in to the NHM every Monday and how technology will be the downfall of taxonomy), then copy and paste a few hundred times and you can be the author of Dry Storeroom No. 2!I should say however, there is a reason I'm giving Dr Storeroom No. 1 2 stars instead of one. Amongst the disjointed, uninteresting pieces, every one and a while, there is a gem, something interesting. While they only last a page or two. The sprinkling of them throughout helped me to power on. Would I recommend the book on this basis? No, but if you find yourself on a deserted island with nothing but this book, just know, theres something good in there."

There are a few bits of actual science sprinkled in, but mostly as a defense of the pure gathering of knowledge and its unpredictable practical application from time to time.The early perspective on technology does little to help. Perhaps in 2006 it was difficult to view large catalogs of images on one's device, but no one today would debate that information retrieval (whether text, image, or even video) is far more efficient on digital devices that dead tree forms. And the dismissal of modern digital engineers trying to build new hierarchies as just hackers playing with software feels somewhat luddite.Not sure this belonged in the science section of the library."
181,0007209886,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5514516-genetic-cuckoo,3,"This was a lovely collection of stories and anecdotes from behind the scenes at the Natural History Museum. It was fascinating to understand the changes of the museum over the years, the relocation of collections and changes in research and conservation within the museum. This book has been on my 'to read list' for years, after I attended a lecture by Richard Fortey at the Natural History Museum and had my copy signed. It is a fascinating book exploring the hidden world of working in a natural history museum. I liked how to book wandered around from topic to topic, like you are exploring the different hidden rooms and galleries, opening different doors to see what they contain. I enjoyed reading it, and it is something you can dip in and out of. Some chapters were more interesting than others, but there is likely to be something for everyone. I think this book would appeal to anyone interested in how museums are run or looking to work in a museum, or interested in nature and science, and how science communication has changed over the years. I would recommend this book to young adults who are interested in science and curation. "
182,0007209886,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5876945-ryan,2,"This book started off strong, with a behind the scenes tour from a veteran who has spent all his working life at this venerable institution. For natural history buffs it is obviously fascinating to be introduced to all the workings and characters, from the time the author joined in the 1960s and all the changes since. However as Fortey gets more into the details and nitty gritty of the cast and more obscure collections it is difficult to sustain interest in the goings on. I had to give it up for good nearing the final chapters after reading about the back stories of scores of ex-staff. I would highly recommend the first two or three chapters to anyone curious about what is beyond the public galleries. Naming and classifying organisms may seem boring but we cannot protect what we don't know and taxonomy is the basic foundation underlying conservation, and this book explains it all with passion."
183,0007209886,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2890743-mike-violano,5,"There is abundant dry British humor in the Dry Storeroom #1. Author Fortey, a trilobite scientist at the Natural History Museum in London, entertains with this behind the scenes history and secrets of the scholarship of the museum’s vast collections. From the 19th century rows of cabinets of curiosities to the more recent galleries that educate and entertain visitors of all ages there is much to learn in these chapters. Museum scientists uncover known and unknown species from the deep oceans, desert sands and find tiny critters under rotting logs. In the chapter on “Old World”, the author describes how and where primitive plants dating back to the dinosaurs have survived in greater numbers that animals. The most fun is found in the chapter on “Animalia” which is actually populated with past directors, department heads long departed and scores of trustees who range from royalty and heroes to imposters and villains. A book to savor and a perfect armchair escape for a summer’s day."

Loved how there was various chapters on cool science topics such as Botany, Geology, Biology and Entomology (that's bugs). I liked the back-of-house history of notable characters in the museums history, and a chronology of the museum's importance (and others like it) in the world's educational theater. I will have to note, that if you read the back cover you would think that this book was going to be about various old museum exhibits with their interesting stories full of scandal and intrigue. For the most part none of that happened.I give it five stars because it promotes Science, was well written and a nice glimpse into a career from someone who genuinely cared for what he was a part of.

I was expecting a fascinating trip through the various treasures of the museum's Dry Storeroom #1. I didn't realize the title was simply a metaphor for the author's ""jumbled locker-room of memory."" The book did feature some of the museum's holdings, but it seemed more time was devoted to gossip about the peculiar habits of this scientist or that collector. Not that some of the stories weren't interesting -- I particularly liked the story of the expert on cryptogams (spore-producing plants) being recruited by the Minister of War to a team devoted to cracking cryptograms (ciphers) and ended providing an invaluable contribution specifically due to his experience with cryptogams.Another frequent topic in the book is taxonomy: its origins, its difficulties, and its importance. While I didn't mind the topic, I could certain imagine other readers skimming through a passage about a specimen that was originally in this genus but was later reclassified to that genus.Another reviewer compared the book to being at a party in conversation with someone droning on about something boring, who then suddenly says something interesting. This is an apt analogy. There were plenty of interesting bits, but there were an unfortunate number of less-than-interesting passages. Ultimately, while this book could have been so much more, it may be worth a look for anyone interested in what goes on behind the scenes at a museum."

HahaThis book was really fascinating.

I love books about ""stuff"" -- cultural histories of objects (such as the screw, the pencil, etc.) and I love books about museums, especially collecting museums. But this book didn't work for me. Partly it's because so little of the book was actually about ""Dry Store Room No. 1"" (which is where they keep all the oddities) and partly it's because the author's voice didn't work for me -- he is too wealthy, too privileged, and perhaps too English (in that particular way the English have of celebrating amateurs) for me.

This is a special kind of book. A marmite book. It's a memoir of a scientist, of a museum, and of a whole era too in a lot of ways. 
 
It manages to cram a history of Taxonomy, the science of classifying things, a personal memoir, a history of the radical changes a century wrought to science in general, particularly the effect Darwin had on all fields of biology, a complete history of the incredible British Museum of Natural History, a biography of Linnaeus, discussion on the value of the colonial legacy of botanical gardens, a history of the changes to the British civil service in the past 40 odd years, a grounding in basic latin and greek, and .... well you get the idea. In fact, I think all the things I listed are covered before the half way point. There's a lot of book in this book!
 
It's a bit of a dry read, unless you're really fascinated by that kind of thing which I am.
It's chock full of hilarious anecdotes too.  You just have to slog through a bit of science to find them.
 
Like the one about the marine cryptogam expert (that's fungi) who was mistaken for a cryptogram expert (note the extra r in there) and whisked off to Bletchley park during the war - only to accidentally save the day (and possibly the war) when he was the only one who knew how to save and restore German codebooks retrieved from a sunken submarine. 
 
I read a good chunk of this, but then I was busy and set it to text-to-speech - which I really don't like usually, but I have this one posh english voice to use so I tried it out - and it actually worked pretty well. '
 
I suspect the audiobook version of this would be really great, if it's got a good narrator, and would probably get a whole 'nother star. In fact, I think I will look out for that, because there's SO much in this book, I am pretty sure I could read it another 3 times and still be finding new things.

201,0007209886,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54683202-clive-bevitt,3,A overview and history of the Natural History Museum. At times both a little dry and gossipy for me.
202,0007209886,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35553726-sara,3,"My college degree (Dutch: HBO) is in Cultural Heritage, but before they changed the name of the degree a couple of weeks before the graduation ceremony, it was museology. Basically, I've been trained for four years to work in a museum (any position really, but my preference will always be registration and documentation of collections). Even though the field I work in has nothing to do with cultural heritage or museums (I do software testing, at the moment for a logistics company), I still love it. So, any vacation my husband and I have, we visit many museums and cultural heritage sites, we watch programs and films about museums, and of course I read books about them. That's how I came to 'Dry Store Room No. 1: The Secret Life of the Natural History Museum' by Richard Fortey. Rochard Fortey is a palaeontologist specialized in the study of trilobites who has worked for the Natural History Museum in London since 1973. This book is his personal store-room of memories of all that time working in the museum. Together with explanations of the how and why of the many types of scientific research undertaken at the Natural History Museum, its history and its building he tells of the people he's worked with all these years. That makes this book a strange introduction to the specific kind of natural science undertaken at a museum (hint, it's a LOT of taxonomy) and a book filled with gossip about the strange characters that worked (under tenure) for the museum. Because of its focus on science (which is totally understandable because that is Fortey's branch of business in the museum) I was disappointed by the book. I had expected/wanted a book about the museum itself. About the collection, the collectors, the conservation, the curators and the exhibitions. Understandable from my point of view, because that is my personal interest in museums. Back in the winter of 2005/2006 my husband and I did an internship at the micro-palaeontological department of the Earth Studies department of the University of Utrecht. Our task was to register and if needed repackage the collection (of ancient mouse teeth basically) in a database system. We had a wonderful introduction into the many difficulties of taxonomy. We also met many of the types of characters (including the scientists who don't retire). We were able to look behind the screens at several natural history museum. And my husband went on to work in Mallorca with the Myotragus collection there in his next internship (a collection that is mentioned in this book). That made most of the parts in this book familiar, and a bit too much (I'd rather read about conservation than taxonomy). Another thing that put me off was Fortey's gossip about his colleagues. I get that he's trying to describe the quirks of scientists in a museum, but I found it unnecessary to make it so personal (working all your life on just beetles is quirky enough for me). Still, for the most part I can't fault Fortey for my disappointment with the book, it is a good, if somewhat rambling description and defense of the importance of scientific research in museums. Three out of five stars, but this will probably be higher if the reader likes to read about (natural) science more."
203,0007209886,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1756815-wendell,3,"I suppose it’s inevitable to compare Dry Storeroom to Douglas Preston’s Dinosaurs in the Attic, though Fortey doesn’t come out ahead in the competition. On the other hand, his Life: A Natural History of the First Four Billion Years of Life on Earth was such a fine book that Dry Storeroom had every reason to be just as engaging. It isn’t, though, and I’m still not entirely sure why. I suspect it’s because Fortey focuses almost exclusively on the scientists who work “behind the scenes” in his museum (or who “worked” there—quite a few of them are dead), and the recounting of old gossip and long-forgotten eccentricities and peccadilloes isn’t nearly as intriguing as Fortey perhaps intended it to be. Throughout, I wanted to hear more about the science itself, about the specimens, about (for crying out loud) trilobites, which are Fortey’s area of specialty. Though he does a decent job of explaining the basics of taxonomy and nomenclature, including a discussion of the conceptual upheaval of the entire endeavor that has been occasioned by our modern capacity to trace species relationships through DNA analysis, all of it feels a tad superficial. Fortey mentions the fact that modern science has challenged the very concept of “species,” but doesn’t ever quite arrive at the point. Other than alluding to the classic “lumpers vs. splitters” feud, meanwhile, he doesn’t speak much about what all of this means for paleontologists, who are forced to erect and defend species on the basis of entirely external characteristics (given that DNA is unavailable). In light of Fortey’s interesting discussion of the complete revolution that took place in the understanding of the taxonomy of just one species of common marine snail, Littorina, following genetic analysis, or the fact that some workers claim that as few as 40% of living species of Conus are valid, one wonders what hope there might be (to take one example) for fossil Conus, a morass if ever there was one—and that’s just a single gastropod in a single (admittedly huge) phylum. I assume that Fortey and his publisher made their editorial decisions deliberately to avoid overwhelming the scientifically handicapped, but I couldn’t help but feel that the dumbing-down sometimes went too far. Fortey takes several occasions to comment on the virtual extinction of the grand scientific enterprises that gave birth to our understanding of the systematics of living things, but he’s more wistful than angry about the way changing funding priorities and budget-slashing at universities and museums have made a victim of science. Anger, indeed, would be justified. Overall, Dry Storeroom is too long on anecdote and too short on analysis of the hard issues, and “popular” begins to bleed over into the territory of the run-of-the-mill. It’s a privilege to read Fortey; it’s just that I suspect he has much more compelling things to say."
204,0007209886,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9820302-sheila,3,"I really enjoyed this chatty and clever memoir of life in the Natural History Museum in London... until the end, when Fortey criticizes the Third World for its failure to properly collect and categorize the life forms that are rapidly disappearing from earth. To Fortey, this is an unspeakable tragedy, that something should die off before it can be named and classified. At this point the reader who knows the history of British colonialism has to slap palm against forehead and think, ""Hold on. Where did Britain (or the US, or France, etc) get the $$$ to build, staff, and stuff these enormous museums?"" The answer is, by stealing land, human beings, labor, resources and intellectual property from Indigenous peoples and the very Third World Fortey criticizes.Museums, of course, are wonderful places... or are they? The American Museum of Natural History in NYC delighted me when I was a child. I was ignorant of its racist history, that museums were trophy halls for the spoils of war and conquest. Museums displayed the new possessions (feathered, footed, and finned) of the ever-curious and acquisitive European. Little did I suspect that there were crypts in which European ""scientists"" could collect and study the remains of whomever they deemed to be less than human. (The heads of Native warriors killed in battle by the US cavalry were sometimes chopped off and sold to museums.) While I was mesmerized by the gorgeous dioramas and stuffed animals, I knew nothing of the white hunters who were busy decimating the African plains of ""game."" Aren't we lucky that the animals who fell to the industrial revolution left one valiant specimen (or two) for our viewing pleasure?A couple of years ago an article appeared which pointed out that Native Americans actually had a more accurate understanding of the nature of wolves than PhD scientists. Why? Well, even though they didn't know those all-important Latin names, the Native people observed wolves in the real world. They did not shoot, dissect, or stuff them or stick them in laboratories, zoos, or museums. Native cultures respect life, and do not look upon animals and plants and minerals as ""resources"" and commodities. I am not opposed to ""science,"" but Life forms would be better served if corporations stopped destroying the planet and impoverishing billions of people. If that happened. the animals and plants would not disappear, and children - not just privileged kids in imperial nations - could actually go outside and look at them in their natural environment. A living animal is always better than a stuffed one.And can we please get rid of that racist statue in front of the AMNH? The one of Teddy Roosevelt astride a horse, towering over an African walking beside him on one side and a Native American (also on foot) on his other side?

205,0007209886,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43477226-todd-stockslager,4,"Behind-the-scenes look at London's Natural History Museum is an interesting peak at the ""coalface""--Fortey's term for the daily work occurring beyond and below the public galleries--of museum science. Fortey describes the main work of the Museum, and its sister institutions in other countries, as systematic taxonomy--the attempt to exhaustively categorize and collect reference examples of each species of plant, animal, and mineral.In an era of hard-to-obtain research grants and declining public funding, Fortey defends this work as valuable for several reasons:--the need to find and identify species before they are destroyed by climate change, environmental destruction, or over-harvesting.--potential beneficial uses of unknown species for the biosphere, for example expanded use of natural predators as environmentally-safe pesticides.--helping future scientific endeavors by placing each species in its proper place in the taxonomy.--and ultimately, the pure aesthetic satisfaction of knowing everything we can know about the world in which we live and upon which we are dependent.Fortey spends time walking the reader virtually through the hidden corridors of each section of the Museum and using the discussion of the physical surroundings to talk in layman's terms about the science and the history of the science. Black-and-white photos in the pages with the text and color plates in the center of the book illustrate the surroundings and the collection as Fortey describes them.But most interesting are the people who work behind the scenes. The current and past scientists, curators, clerks, Keepers, Directors, and Trustees are a diverse, intelligent, and intensely fascinating lot. After describing some of the more legendary polymaths who seemed as if they would scarcely have time to indulge in their many interests, Fortey asks in wonderment: ""Are we lesser people today, or do we expect less of ourselves?""Of course the Museum also has its share of misfits, misanthropes, recluses, shysters, and just plain crazy people deep in the hallways behind the public galleries, and Fortey seems to take special glee in describing them, many of whom he knew personally from his 30-plus years in the corridors. He writes with an understated, decidedly British wit and language. I'm guessing I missed some of his best jokes as they glanced off my tin American ear, but unless you get the opportunity to tour the hallways (which he compares to the phantasmagorical and never-ending castle in the The Gormenghast Novels) with Fortey in person, this book will be your personal tour guide."
206,0007209886,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1385097-harry-rutherford,4,"Dry Store Room No. 1: The Secret Life of the Natural History Museum is about the behind-the-scenes work at the Natural History Museum in London. Whether you find that an appealing subject for a book depends, I suppose, on your feelings about museums and/or natural history; personally I found it irresistible.The public face of the museum — animatronic dinosaurs and overexcited schoolchildren — gives relatively little sense of the scientific work that goes on behind the scenes, all of which is centred on the museum's collection of biological specimens: pressed plants, trays of pinned beetles, drawers full of bird skins or fossils, jars of starfish in alcohol. The sheer scale of these collections is hard to comprehend: the museum holds over 70 million specimens. That means every person in the UK could be given one to take home and they'd still have enough left over for everyone in Sweden. 28 million of them are insects.The collections haven't been accumulated simply through an excess of acquisitiveness, although there must be some connection between the satisfaction biologists get from collecting beetles and other people's collections of stamps, obscure soul 45s or golf memorabilia. The point of the collection is that it is a vast reference library: if you find an earwig in Burma and you're not sure whether it's a new species, you can start by checking the literature; but if all else fails, the last resort is to go to a museum, open up the drawers full of earwigs, and start peering at them through a microscope.This kind of taxonomical work — preparing specimens, describing species, working out their relationships, publishing highly technical articles about it — might seem to be complete drudgery to an outsider; it is slow, careful, precise, unglamorous. But it obviously has a hold on people, because the book is full of people who spend decades working on some particular group of organisms, retire, and then keep coming in to the museum to continue their work in retirement. Fortey himself is apparently one of them, retired in 2006 but still working away at his trilobites.The books combines a history of the museum, examples of the work done there, anecdotes about characters on the staff (not surprisingly, perhaps, there have been a few notable eccentrics) and a passionate defence of taxonomy as a valuable field of study. It's well-written, frequently entertaining, pitched at the interested amateur, and I thoroughly enjoyed it."
207,0007209886,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15743853-don,4,"I found the title of this excellent book a little misleading - I came to it expecting it to be mostly about people and their lives - the 'scandals and skulduggery', as the blurb has it. It turned out to be a great deal more than that - it is mainly about the work of the Natural History Museum (which is mostly taxonomy and curation; the classification of the natural world - living, fossil and mineral - and the preservation of examples that illustrate it), why it is important, and how the perception of that importance has changed over the years. For anyone interested in natural history, and in the great national museums devoted to it, this is essential and fascinating reading. However, there is a strong undercurrent flowing through this book that makes it rather better, and more important, than might at first appear. In charting those changes in perception of the Museum's work, shown in part through the extraordinary cast of characters that have worked there, Fortey records the progressive changes in how its work has been funded (and, increasingly, not funded) - and the political forces that have driven those changes. He ends on an optimistic note, observing that the advent of the internet, the drive to digitise historical records and the movement to publish on-line have had the effect of 'democratising' taxonomy. He envisages a return to the era of the gifted amateur who develops expertise in a chosen corner of the living world, but now including many people in the developing world who in past times would have been excluded from such activities. These amateurs would be supported by professional taxonomists whose principal tool is DNA analysis, but who would also (Fortey thinks) exercise a benign oversight to prevent the whole enterprise developing chaotically, with a proliferation of inadequately defined species, many of which might be figments of the naturalist's imagination. There is some virtue in this vision - although I suspect there is also a good deal of wishful thinking. How much better it would be if government paymasters realised for themselves the value of the work done by museums - and other government scientific agencies - which in the long term is likely to be of greater lasting significance than the plethora of 'peer-reviewed' scientific papers by which the worth of scientists and their work is currently judged.

208,0007209886,http://goodreads.com/user/show/339857-cindy,4,"Themes: natural history, conservation, research, weird scienceSetting: The Natural History Museum in London, EnglandEver read books where they talk about going up to the British Museum for the day? Well, the British Museum is now the Natural History Museum (and a few other spin-offs) and Fortey takes the reader behind the scenes for an insider's view on what really goes on in such a huge museum.Fortey started his career as a biologist back when the museum was a slightly stuffier and more serious place, and only retired a few years ago, by which time the museum had become more of an attraction and began updating exhibits to attract paying guests. But the focus remains on the science. However, his book isn't really just about the history of the museum, its contributions to English scientific understanding and so on, but rather his own experiences, acquaintances, his explorations of all the hidden little corners of the vast building, and the gossip about the many folks who work there.And what juicy gossip there is! You wouldn't think that there would be much room for racy anecdotes among the dry and serious types who work at the museum, but wow, you would be so wrong. This and the Shakespeare book both convince me that gossip was much more interesting before it started revolving around which celebrity was sleeping with whom, which had an eating disorder, and who is feuding with whom.For his format, he starts with the collections of the museum, from mammals and plants and insects (lots of great stories there) to minerals and then the nuts and bolts of how such a place is run and what it takes to keep it going. The book is full of quirky personalities, which makes it so much more fun to read. He does stick his own opinions in there about evolution and religion, about the need to preserve every single species no matter how obscure, about the damage human beings are doing to the planet, about his political views, but he keeps those parts fairly brief and gets on with the more interesting stories of people he has met and colorful characters from the museum's past. I really enjoyed one. Recommended."
209,0007209886,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39215456-chris,2,"This book nearly defeated me on three separate occasions, I resisted the urge to put the book down and walk away only because I couldn't let it beat me. Don't make the same mistake I did, don't start the book.I should start off by saying the book reads less like a nonfiction book, more like a bland textbook. Dr. Fortey could have stopped after the first word and come up with a more accurate title. This is coming from someone who typically enjoys natural history and who gets excited about the prospect of sitting in a small, stuffy little office in the bowels of some old building.The book reads like a disjointed series of tidbits, sorted roughly into categories (Zoology, Botany, Entomology, etc.) and within those tidbits, Fortey frequently gets distracted and sidetracked, offering asides and sidebars that neither add anything nor help to make the main story any more interesting or intelligible. In addition, you're bombarded with an onslaught of names that go in one ear and out the other even though each only matters for the three or four paragraphs dedicated to each individual.The book drags on, each anecdote more similar to the one before. EL Harvishire, the diatom man, was digging in West Bromwich, Staffordshire, between 1909 and 1916 and published The Catalogue of the Freshwater Diatoms of the West Bromwich Manor House Garden Pond and he told me he found forty new species there.Change the names, add a few more sentences (likely about how EL Harvishire still comes in to the NHM every Monday and how technology will be the downfall of taxonomy), then copy and paste a few hundred times and you can be the author of Dry Storeroom No. 2!I should say however, there is a reason I'm giving Dr Storeroom No. 1 2 stars instead of one. Amongst the disjointed, uninteresting pieces, every one and a while, there is a gem, something interesting. While they only last a page or two. The sprinkling of them throughout helped me to power on. Would I recommend the book on this basis? No, but if you find yourself on a deserted island with nothing but this book, just know, theres something good in there."

There are a few bits of actual science sprinkled in, but mostly as a defense of the pure gathering of knowledge and its unpredictable practical application from time to time.The early perspective on technology does little to help. Perhaps in 2006 it was difficult to view large catalogs of images on one's device, but no one today would debate that information retrieval (whether text, image, or even video) is far more efficient on digital devices that dead tree forms. And the dismissal of modern digital engineers trying to build new hierarchies as just hackers playing with software feels somewhat luddite.Not sure this belonged in the science section of the library."
211,0007209886,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5514516-genetic-cuckoo,3,"This was a lovely collection of stories and anecdotes from behind the scenes at the Natural History Museum. It was fascinating to understand the changes of the museum over the years, the relocation of collections and changes in research and conservation within the museum. This book has been on my 'to read list' for years, after I attended a lecture by Richard Fortey at the Natural History Museum and had my copy signed. It is a fascinating book exploring the hidden world of working in a natural history museum. I liked how to book wandered around from topic to topic, like you are exploring the different hidden rooms and galleries, opening different doors to see what they contain. I enjoyed reading it, and it is something you can dip in and out of. Some chapters were more interesting than others, but there is likely to be something for everyone. I think this book would appeal to anyone interested in how museums are run or looking to work in a museum, or interested in nature and science, and how science communication has changed over the years. I would recommend this book to young adults who are interested in science and curation. "
212,0007209886,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5876945-ryan,2,"This book started off strong, with a behind the scenes tour from a veteran who has spent all his working life at this venerable institution. For natural history buffs it is obviously fascinating to be introduced to all the workings and characters, from the time the author joined in the 1960s and all the changes since. However as Fortey gets more into the details and nitty gritty of the cast and more obscure collections it is difficult to sustain interest in the goings on. I had to give it up for good nearing the final chapters after reading about the back stories of scores of ex-staff. I would highly recommend the first two or three chapters to anyone curious about what is beyond the public galleries. Naming and classifying organisms may seem boring but we cannot protect what we don't know and taxonomy is the basic foundation underlying conservation, and this book explains it all with passion."

From the 19th century rows of cabinets of curiosities to the more recent galleries that educate and entertain visitors of all ages there is much to learn in these chapters. Museum scientists uncover known and unknown species from the deep oceans, desert sands and find tiny critters under rotting logs. In the chapter on “Old World”, the author describes how and where primitive plants dating back to the dinosaurs have survived in greater numbers that animals. The most fun is found in the chapter on “Animalia” which is actually populated with past directors, department heads long departed and scores of trustees who range from royalty and heroes to imposters and villains. A book to savor and a perfect armchair escape for a summer’s day."

Loved how there was various chapters on cool science topics such as Botany, Geology, Biology and Entomology (that's bugs). I liked the back-of-house history of notable characters in the museums history, and a chronology of the museum's importance (and others like it) in the world's educational theater. I will have to note, that if you read the back cover you would think that this book was going to be about various old museum exhibits with their interesting stories full of scandal and intrigue. For the most part none of that happened.I give it five stars because it promotes Science, was well written and a nice glimpse into a career from someone who genuinely cared for what he was a part of. Richard Fortay was a charming author who represented Science professionals from all fields very well. Nice job!."

I was expecting a fascinating trip through the various treasures of the museum's Dry Storeroom #1. I didn't realize the title was simply a metaphor for the author's ""jumbled locker-room of memory."" The book did feature some of the museum's holdings, but it seemed more time was devoted to gossip about the peculiar habits of this scientist or that collector. Not that some of the stories weren't interesting -- I particularly liked the story of the expert on cryptogams (spore-producing plants) being recruited by the Minister of War to a team devoted to cracking cryptograms (ciphers) and ended providing an invaluable contribution specifically due to his experience with cryptogams.Another frequent topic in the book is taxonomy: its origins, its difficulties, and its importance. While I didn't mind the topic, I could certain imagine other readers skimming through a passage about a specimen that was originally in this genus but was later reclassified to that genus.Another reviewer compared the book to being at a party in conversation with someone droning on about something boring, who then suddenly says something interesting. This is an apt analogy. There were plenty of interesting bits, but there were an unfortunate number of less-than-interesting passages. Ultimately, while this book could have been so much more, it may be worth a look for anyone interested in what goes on behind the scenes at a museum."

I love books about ""stuff"" -- cultural histories of objects (such as the screw, the pencil, etc.) and I love books about museums, especially collecting museums. But this book didn't work for me. Partly it's because so little of the book was actually about ""Dry Store Room No. 1"" (which is where they keep all the oddities) and partly it's because the author's voice didn't work for me -- he is too wealthy, too privileged, and perhaps too English (in that particular way the English have of celebrating amateurs) for me.

This is a special kind of book. A marmite book. It's a memoir of a scientist, of a museum, and of a whole era too in a lot of ways. 
 
It manages to cram a history of Taxonomy, the science of classifying things, a personal memoir, a history of the radical changes a century wrought to science in general, particularly the effect Darwin had on all fields of biology, a complete history of the incredible British Museum of Natural History, a biography of Linnaeus, discussion on the value of the colonial legacy of botanical gardens, a history of the changes to the British civil service in the past 40 odd years, a grounding in basic latin and greek, and .... well you get the idea. In fact, I think all the things I listed are covered before the half way point. There's a lot of book in this book!
 
It's a bit of a dry read, unless you're really fascinated by that kind of thing which I am.
It's chock full of hilarious anecdotes too.  You just have to slog through a bit of science to find them.
 
Like the one about the marine cryptogam expert (that's fungi) who was mistaken for a cryptogram expert (note the extra r in there) and whisked off to Bletchley park during the war - only to accidentally save the day (and possibly the war) when he was the only one who knew how to save and restore German codebooks retrieved from a sunken submarine. 
 
I read a good chunk of this, but then I was busy and set it to text-to-speech - which I really don't like usually, but I have this one posh english voice to use so I tried it out - and it actually worked pretty well. '
 
I suspect the audiobook version of this would be really great, if it's got a good narrator, and would probably get a whole 'nother star. In fact, I think I will look out for that, because there's SO much in this book, I am pretty sure I could read it another 3 times and still be finding new things.

231,0007209886,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54683202-clive-bevitt,3,A overview and history of the Natural History Museum. At times both a little dry and gossipy for me.
232,0007209886,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35553726-sara,3,"My college degree (Dutch: HBO) is in Cultural Heritage, but before they changed the name of the degree a couple of weeks before the graduation ceremony, it was museology. Basically, I've been trained for four years to work in a museum (any position really, but my preference will always be registration and documentation of collections). Even though the field I work in has nothing to do with cultural heritage or museums (I do software testing, at the moment for a logistics company), I still love it. So, any vacation my husband and I have, we visit many museums and cultural heritage sites, we watch programs and films about museums, and of course I read books about them. That's how I came to 'Dry Store Room No. 1: The Secret Life of the Natural History Museum' by Richard Fortey. Rochard Fortey is a palaeontologist specialized in the study of trilobites who has worked for the Natural History Museum in London since 1973. This book is his personal store-room of memories of all that time working in the museum. Together with explanations of the how and why of the many types of scientific research undertaken at the Natural History Museum, its history and its building he tells of the people he's worked with all these years. That makes this book a strange introduction to the specific kind of natural science undertaken at a museum (hint, it's a LOT of taxonomy) and a book filled with gossip about the strange characters that worked (under tenure) for the museum. Because of its focus on science (which is totally understandable because that is Fortey's branch of business in the museum) I was disappointed by the book. I had expected/wanted a book about the museum itself. About the collection, the collectors, the conservation, the curators and the exhibitions. Understandable from my point of view, because that is my personal interest in museums. Back in the winter of 2005/2006 my husband and I did an internship at the micro-palaeontological department of the Earth Studies department of the University of Utrecht. Our task was to register and if needed repackage the collection (of ancient mouse teeth basically) in a database system. We had a wonderful introduction into the many difficulties of taxonomy. We also met many of the types of characters (including the scientists who don't retire). We were able to look behind the screens at several natural history museum. And my husband went on to work in Mallorca with the Myotragus collection there in his next internship (a collection that is mentioned in this book). That made most of the parts in this book familiar, and a bit too much (I'd rather read about conservation than taxonomy). Another thing that put me off was Fortey's gossip about his colleagues. I get that he's trying to describe the quirks of scientists in a museum, but I found it unnecessary to make it so personal (working all your life on just beetles is quirky enough for me). Still, for the most part I can't fault Fortey for my disappointment with the book, it is a good, if somewhat rambling description and defense of the importance of scientific research in museums. Three out of five stars, but this will probably be higher if the reader likes to read about (natural) science more."
233,0007209886,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1756815-wendell,3,"I suppose it’s inevitable to compare Dry Storeroom to Douglas Preston’s Dinosaurs in the Attic, though Fortey doesn’t come out ahead in the competition. On the other hand, his Life: A Natural History of the First Four Billion Years of Life on Earth was such a fine book that Dry Storeroom had every reason to be just as engaging. It isn’t, though, and I’m still not entirely sure why. I suspect it’s because Fortey focuses almost exclusively on the scientists who work “behind the scenes” in his museum (or who “worked” there—quite a few of them are dead), and the recounting of old gossip and long-forgotten eccentricities and peccadilloes isn’t nearly as intriguing as Fortey perhaps intended it to be. Throughout, I wanted to hear more about the science itself, about the specimens, about (for crying out loud) trilobites, which are Fortey’s area of specialty. Though he does a decent job of explaining the basics of taxonomy and nomenclature, including a discussion of the conceptual upheaval of the entire endeavor that has been occasioned by our modern capacity to trace species relationships through DNA analysis, all of it feels a tad superficial. Fortey mentions the fact that modern science has challenged the very concept of “species,” but doesn’t ever quite arrive at the point. Other than alluding to the classic “lumpers vs. splitters” feud, meanwhile, he doesn’t speak much about what all of this means for paleontologists, who are forced to erect and defend species on the basis of entirely external characteristics (given that DNA is unavailable). In light of Fortey’s interesting discussion of the complete revolution that took place in the understanding of the taxonomy of just one species of common marine snail, Littorina, following genetic analysis, or the fact that some workers claim that as few as 40% of living species of Conus are valid, one wonders what hope there might be (to take one example) for fossil Conus, a morass if ever there was one—and that’s just a single gastropod in a single (admittedly huge) phylum. I assume that Fortey and his publisher made their editorial decisions deliberately to avoid overwhelming the scientifically handicapped, but I couldn’t help but feel that the dumbing-down sometimes went too far. Fortey takes several occasions to comment on the virtual extinction of the grand scientific enterprises that gave birth to our understanding of the systematics of living things, but he’s more wistful than angry about the way changing funding priorities and budget-slashing at universities and museums have made a victim of science. Anger, indeed, would be justified. Overall, Dry Storeroom is too long on anecdote and too short on analysis of the hard issues, and “popular” begins to bleed over into the territory of the run-of-the-mill. It’s a privilege to read Fortey; it’s just that I suspect he has much more compelling things to say."
234,0007209886,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9820302-sheila,3,"I really enjoyed this chatty and clever memoir of life in the Natural History Museum in London... until the end, when Fortey criticizes the Third World for its failure to properly collect and categorize the life forms that are rapidly disappearing from earth. To Fortey, this is an unspeakable tragedy, that something should die off before it can be named and classified. At this point the reader who knows the history of British colonialism has to slap palm against forehead and think, ""Hold on. Where did Britain (or the US, or France, etc) get the $$$ to build, staff, and stuff these enormous museums?"" The answer is, by stealing land, human beings, labor, resources and intellectual property from Indigenous peoples and the very Third World Fortey criticizes.Museums, of course, are wonderful places... or are they? The American Museum of Natural History in NYC delighted me when I was a child. I was ignorant of its racist history, that museums were trophy halls for the spoils of war and conquest. Museums displayed the new possessions (feathered, footed, and finned) of the ever-curious and acquisitive European. Little did I suspect that there were crypts in which European ""scientists"" could collect and study the remains of whomever they deemed to be less than human. (The heads of Native warriors killed in battle by the US cavalry were sometimes chopped off and sold to museums.) While I was mesmerized by the gorgeous dioramas and stuffed animals, I knew nothing of the white hunters who were busy decimating the African plains of ""game."" Aren't we lucky that the animals who fell to the industrial revolution left one valiant specimen (or two) for our viewing pleasure?A couple of years ago an article appeared which pointed out that Native Americans actually had a more accurate understanding of the nature of wolves than PhD scientists. Why? Well, even though they didn't know those all-important Latin names, the Native people observed wolves in the real world. They did not shoot, dissect, or stuff them or stick them in laboratories, zoos, or museums. Native cultures respect life, and do not look upon animals and plants and minerals as ""resources"" and commodities. I am not opposed to ""science,"" but Life forms would be better served if corporations stopped destroying the planet and impoverishing billions of people. If that happened. the animals and plants would not disappear, and children - not just privileged kids in imperial nations - could actually go outside and look at them in their natural environment. A living animal is always better than a stuffed one.And can we please get rid of that racist statue in front of the AMNH? The one of Teddy Roosevelt astride a horse, towering over an African walking beside him on one side and a Native American (also on foot) on his other side?

235,0007209886,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43477226-todd-stockslager,4,"Behind-the-scenes look at London's Natural History Museum is an interesting peak at the ""coalface""--Fortey's term for the daily work occurring beyond and below the public galleries--of museum science. Fortey describes the main work of the Museum, and its sister institutions in other countries, as systematic taxonomy--the attempt to exhaustively categorize and collect reference examples of each species of plant, animal, and mineral.In an era of hard-to-obtain research grants and declining public funding, Fortey defends this work as valuable for several reasons:--the need to find and identify species before they are destroyed by climate change, environmental destruction, or over-harvesting.--potential beneficial uses of unknown species for the biosphere, for example expanded use of natural predators as environmentally-safe pesticides.--helping future scientific endeavors by placing each species in its proper place in the taxonomy.--and ultimately, the pure aesthetic satisfaction of knowing everything we can know about the world in which we live and upon which we are dependent.Fortey spends time walking the reader virtually through the hidden corridors of each section of the Museum and using the discussion of the physical surroundings to talk in layman's terms about the science and the history of the science. Black-and-white photos in the pages with the text and color plates in the center of the book illustrate the surroundings and the collection as Fortey describes them.But most interesting are the people who work behind the scenes. The current and past scientists, curators, clerks, Keepers, Directors, and Trustees are a diverse, intelligent, and intensely fascinating lot. After describing some of the more legendary polymaths who seemed as if they would scarcely have time to indulge in their many interests, Fortey asks in wonderment: ""Are we lesser people today, or do we expect less of ourselves?""Of course the Museum also has its share of misfits, misanthropes, recluses, shysters, and just plain crazy people deep in the hallways behind the public galleries, and Fortey seems to take special glee in describing them, many of whom he knew personally from his 30-plus years in the corridors. He writes with an understated, decidedly British wit and language. I'm guessing I missed some of his best jokes as they glanced off my tin American ear, but unless you get the opportunity to tour the hallways (which he compares to the phantasmagorical and never-ending castle in the The Gormenghast Novels) with Fortey in person, this book will be your personal tour guide."
236,0007209886,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1385097-harry-rutherford,4,"Dry Store Room No. 1: The Secret Life of the Natural History Museum is about the behind-the-scenes work at the Natural History Museum in London. Whether you find that an appealing subject for a book depends, I suppose, on your feelings about museums and/or natural history; personally I found it irresistible.The public face of the museum — animatronic dinosaurs and overexcited schoolchildren — gives relatively little sense of the scientific work that goes on behind the scenes, all of which is centred on the museum's collection of biological specimens: pressed plants, trays of pinned beetles, drawers full of bird skins or fossils, jars of starfish in alcohol. The sheer scale of these collections is hard to comprehend: the museum holds over 70 million specimens. That means every person in the UK could be given one to take home and they'd still have enough left over for everyone in Sweden. 28 million of them are insects.The collections haven't been accumulated simply through an excess of acquisitiveness, although there must be some connection between the satisfaction biologists get from collecting beetles and other people's collections of stamps, obscure soul 45s or golf memorabilia. The point of the collection is that it is a vast reference library: if you find an earwig in Burma and you're not sure whether it's a new species, you can start by checking the literature; but if all else fails, the last resort is to go to a museum, open up the drawers full of earwigs, and start peering at them through a microscope.This kind of taxonomical work — preparing specimens, describing species, working out their relationships, publishing highly technical articles about it — might seem to be complete drudgery to an outsider; it is slow, careful, precise, unglamorous. But it obviously has a hold on people, because the book is full of people who spend decades working on some particular group of organisms, retire, and then keep coming in to the museum to continue their work in retirement. Fortey himself is apparently one of them, retired in 2006 but still working away at his trilobites.The books combines a history of the museum, examples of the work done there, anecdotes about characters on the staff (not surprisingly, perhaps, there have been a few notable eccentrics) and a passionate defence of taxonomy as a valuable field of study. It's well-written, frequently entertaining, pitched at the interested amateur, and I thoroughly enjoyed it."
237,0007209886,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15743853-don,4,"I found the title of this excellent book a little misleading - I came to it expecting it to be mostly about people and their lives - the 'scandals and skulduggery', as the blurb has it. It turned out to be a great deal more than that - it is mainly about the work of the Natural History Museum (which is mostly taxonomy and curation; the classification of the natural world - living, fossil and mineral - and the preservation of examples that illustrate it), why it is important, and how the perception of that importance has changed over the years. For anyone interested in natural history, and in the great national museums devoted to it, this is essential and fascinating reading. However, there is a strong undercurrent flowing through this book that makes it rather better, and more important, than might at first appear. In charting those changes in perception of the Museum's work, shown in part through the extraordinary cast of characters that have worked there, Fortey records the progressive changes in how its work has been funded (and, increasingly, not funded) - and the political forces that have driven those changes. He ends on an optimistic note, observing that the advent of the internet, the drive to digitise historical records and the movement to publish on-line have had the effect of 'democratising' taxonomy. He envisages a return to the era of the gifted amateur who develops expertise in a chosen corner of the living world, but now including many people in the developing world who in past times would have been excluded from such activities. These amateurs would be supported by professional taxonomists whose principal tool is DNA analysis, but who would also (Fortey thinks) exercise a benign oversight to prevent the whole enterprise developing chaotically, with a proliferation of inadequately defined species, many of which might be figments of the naturalist's imagination. There is some virtue in this vision - although I suspect there is also a good deal of wishful thinking. How much better it would be if government paymasters realised for themselves the value of the work done by museums - and other government scientific agencies - which in the long term is likely to be of greater lasting significance than the plethora of 'peer-reviewed' scientific papers by which the worth of scientists and their work is currently judged.

238,0007209886,http://goodreads.com/user/show/339857-cindy,4,"Themes: natural history, conservation, research, weird scienceSetting: The Natural History Museum in London, EnglandEver read books where they talk about going up to the British Museum for the day? Well, the British Museum is now the Natural History Museum (and a few other spin-offs) and Fortey takes the reader behind the scenes for an insider's view on what really goes on in such a huge museum.Fortey started his career as a biologist back when the museum was a slightly stuffier and more serious place, and only retired a few years ago, by which time the museum had become more of an attraction and began updating exhibits to attract paying guests. But the focus remains on the science. However, his book isn't really just about the history of the museum, its contributions to English scientific understanding and so on, but rather his own experiences, acquaintances, his explorations of all the hidden little corners of the vast building, and the gossip about the many folks who work there.And what juicy gossip there is! You wouldn't think that there would be much room for racy anecdotes among the dry and serious types who work at the museum, but wow, you would be so wrong. This and the Shakespeare book both convince me that gossip was much more interesting before it started revolving around which celebrity was sleeping with whom, which had an eating disorder, and who is feuding with whom.For his format, he starts with the collections of the museum, from mammals and plants and insects (lots of great stories there) to minerals and then the nuts and bolts of how such a place is run and what it takes to keep it going. The book is full of quirky personalities, which makes it so much more fun to read. He does stick his own opinions in there about evolution and religion, about the need to preserve every single species no matter how obscure, about the damage human beings are doing to the planet, about his political views, but he keeps those parts fairly brief and gets on with the more interesting stories of people he has met and colorful characters from the museum's past. I really enjoyed one. Recommended."
239,0007209886,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39215456-chris,2,"This book nearly defeated me on three separate occasions, I resisted the urge to put the book down and walk away only because I couldn't let it beat me. Don't make the same mistake I did, don't start the book.I should start off by saying the book reads less like a nonfiction book, more like a bland textbook. Dr. Fortey could have stopped after the first word and come up with a more accurate title. This is coming from someone who typically enjoys natural history and who gets excited about the prospect of sitting in a small, stuffy little office in the bowels of some old building.The book reads like a disjointed series of tidbits, sorted roughly into categories (Zoology, Botany, Entomology, etc.) and within those tidbits, Fortey frequently gets distracted and sidetracked, offering asides and sidebars that neither add anything nor help to make the main story any more interesting or intelligible. In addition, you're bombarded with an onslaught of names that go in one ear and out the other even though each only matters for the three or four paragraphs dedicated to each individual.The book drags on, each anecdote more similar to the one before. EL Harvishire, the diatom man, was digging in West Bromwich, Staffordshire, between 1909 and 1916 and published The Catalogue of the Freshwater Diatoms of the West Bromwich Manor House Garden Pond and he told me he found forty new species there.Change the names, add a few more sentences (likely about how EL Harvishire still comes in to the NHM every Monday and how technology will be the downfall of taxonomy), then copy and paste a few hundred times and you can be the author of Dry Storeroom No. 2!I should say however, there is a reason I'm giving Dr Storeroom No. 1 2 stars instead of one. Amongst the disjointed, uninteresting pieces, every one and a while, there is a gem, something interesting. While they only last a page or two. The sprinkling of them throughout helped me to power on. Would I recommend the book on this basis? No, but if you find yourself on a deserted island with nothing but this book, just know, theres something good in there."

There are a few bits of actual science sprinkled in, but mostly as a defense of the pure gathering of knowledge and its unpredictable practical application from time to time.The early perspective on technology does little to help. Perhaps in 2006 it was difficult to view large catalogs of images on one's device, but no one today would debate that information retrieval (whether text, image, or even video) is far more efficient on digital devices that dead tree forms. And the dismissal of modern digital engineers trying to build new hierarchies as just hackers playing with software feels somewhat luddite.Not sure this belonged in the science section of the library."

It was fascinating to understand the changes of the museum over the years, the relocation of collections and changes in research and conservation within the museum. This book has been on my 'to read list' for years, after I attended a lecture by Richard Fortey at the Natural History Museum and had my copy signed. It is a fascinating book exploring the hidden world of working in a natural history museum. I liked how to book wandered around from topic to topic, like you are exploring the different hidden rooms and galleries, opening different doors to see what they contain. I enjoyed reading it, and it is something you can dip in and out of. Some chapters were more interesting than others, but there is likely to be something for everyone. I think this book would appeal to anyone interested in how museums are run or looking to work in a museum, or interested in nature and science, and how science communication has changed over the years. I would recommend this book to young adults who are interested in science and curation. "
242,0007209886,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5876945-ryan,2,"This book started off strong, with a behind the scenes tour from a veteran who has spent all his working life at this venerable institution. For natural history buffs it is obviously fascinating to be introduced to all the workings and characters, from the time the author joined in the 1960s and all the changes since. However as Fortey gets more into the details and nitty gritty of the cast and more obscure collections it is difficult to sustain interest in the goings on. I had to give it up for good nearing the final chapters after reading about the back stories of scores of ex-staff. I would highly recommend the first two or three chapters to anyone curious about what is beyond the public galleries. Naming and classifying organisms may seem boring but we cannot protect what we don't know and taxonomy is the basic foundation underlying conservation, and this book explains it all with passion."
243,0007209886,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2890743-mike-violano,5,"There is abundant dry British humor in the Dry Storeroom #1. Author Fortey, a trilobite scientist at the Natural History Museum in London, entertains with this behind the scenes history and secrets of the scholarship of the museum’s vast collections. From the 19th century rows of cabinets of curiosities to the more recent galleries that educate and entertain visitors of all ages there is much to learn in these chapters. Museum scientists uncover known and unknown species from the deep oceans, desert sands and find tiny critters under rotting logs. In the chapter on “Old World”, the author describes how and where primitive plants dating back to the dinosaurs have survived in greater numbers that animals. The most fun is found in the chapter on “Animalia” which is actually populated with past directors, department heads long departed and scores of trustees who range from royalty and heroes to imposters and villains. A book to savor and a perfect armchair escape for a summer’s day."

Loved how there was various chapters on cool science topics such as Botany, Geology, Biology and Entomology (that's bugs). I liked the back-of-house history of notable characters in the museums history, and a chronology of the museum's importance (and others like it) in the world's educational theater. I will have to note, that if you read the back cover you would think that this book was going to be about various old museum exhibits with their interesting stories full of scandal and intrigue. For the most part none of that happened.I give it five stars because it promotes Science, was well written and a nice glimpse into a career from someone who genuinely cared for what he was a part of. Richard Fortay was a charming author who represented Science professionals from all fields very well. Nice job!."

I was expecting a fascinating trip through the various treasures of the museum's Dry Storeroom #1. I didn't realize the title was simply a metaphor for the author's ""jumbled locker-room of memory."" The book did feature some of the museum's holdings, but it seemed more time was devoted to gossip about the peculiar habits of this scientist or that collector. Not that some of the stories weren't interesting -- I particularly liked the story of the expert on cryptogams (spore-producing plants) being recruited by the Minister of War to a team devoted to cracking cryptograms (ciphers) and ended providing an invaluable contribution specifically due to his experience with cryptogams.Another frequent topic in the book is taxonomy: its origins, its difficulties, and its importance. While I didn't mind the topic, I could certain imagine other readers skimming through a passage about a specimen that was originally in this genus but was later reclassified to that genus.Another reviewer compared the book to being at a party in conversation with someone droning on about something boring, who then suddenly says something interesting. This is an apt analogy. There were plenty of interesting bits, but there were an unfortunate number of less-than-interesting passages. Ultimately, while this book could have been so much more, it may be worth a look for anyone interested in what goes on behind the scenes at a museum."

HahaThis book was really fascinating. I've just always dreamed of working in a museum, even as my focus and interests have changed, so it was really cool to just read about it and get a little peak into that life."

I love books about ""stuff"" -- cultural histories of objects (such as the screw, the pencil, etc.) and I love books about museums, especially collecting museums. But this book didn't work for me. Partly it's because so little of the book was actually about ""Dry Store Room No. 1"" (which is where they keep all the oddities) and partly it's because the author's voice didn't work for me -- he is too wealthy, too privileged, and perhaps too English (in that particular way the English have of celebrating amateurs) for me.

This is a special kind of book. A marmite book. It's a memoir of a scientist, of a museum, and of a whole era too in a lot of ways. 
 
It manages to cram a history of Taxonomy, the science of classifying things, a personal memoir, a history of the radical changes a century wrought to science in general, particularly the effect Darwin had on all fields of biology, a complete history of the incredible British Museum of Natural History, a biography of Linnaeus, discussion on the value of the colonial legacy of botanical gardens, a history of the changes to the British civil service in the past 40 odd years, a grounding in basic latin and greek, and .... well you get the idea. In fact, I think all the things I listed are covered before the half way point. There's a lot of book in this book!
 
It's a bit of a dry read, unless you're really fascinated by that kind of thing which I am.
It's chock full of hilarious anecdotes too.  You just have to slog through a bit of science to find them.
 
Like the one about the marine cryptogam expert (that's fungi) who was mistaken for a cryptogram expert (note the extra r in there) and whisked off to Bletchley park during the war - only to accidentally save the day (and possibly the war) when he was the only one who knew how to save and restore German codebooks retrieved from a sunken submarine. 
 
I read a good chunk of this, but then I was busy and set it to text-to-speech - which I really don't like usually, but I have this one posh english voice to use so I tried it out - and it actually worked pretty well. '
 
I suspect the audiobook version of this would be really great, if it's got a good narrator, and would probably get a whole 'nother star. In fact, I think I will look out for that, because there's SO much in this book, I am pretty sure I could read it another 3 times and still be finding new things.

261,0007209886,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54683202-clive-bevitt,3,A overview and history of the Natural History Museum. At times both a little dry and gossipy for me.
262,0007209886,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35553726-sara,3,"My college degree (Dutch: HBO) is in Cultural Heritage, but before they changed the name of the degree a couple of weeks before the graduation ceremony, it was museology. Basically, I've been trained for four years to work in a museum (any position really, but my preference will always be registration and documentation of collections). Even though the field I work in has nothing to do with cultural heritage or museums (I do software testing, at the moment for a logistics company), I still love it. So, any vacation my husband and I have, we visit many museums and cultural heritage sites, we watch programs and films about museums, and of course I read books about them. That's how I came to 'Dry Store Room No. 1: The Secret Life of the Natural History Museum' by Richard Fortey. Rochard Fortey is a palaeontologist specialized in the study of trilobites who has worked for the Natural History Museum in London since 1973. This book is his personal store-room of memories of all that time working in the museum. Together with explanations of the how and why of the many types of scientific research undertaken at the Natural History Museum, its history and its building he tells of the people he's worked with all these years. That makes this book a strange introduction to the specific kind of natural science undertaken at a museum (hint, it's a LOT of taxonomy) and a book filled with gossip about the strange characters that worked (under tenure) for the museum. Because of its focus on science (which is totally understandable because that is Fortey's branch of business in the museum) I was disappointed by the book. I had expected/wanted a book about the museum itself. About the collection, the collectors, the conservation, the curators and the exhibitions. Understandable from my point of view, because that is my personal interest in museums. Back in the winter of 2005/2006 my husband and I did an internship at the micro-palaeontological department of the Earth Studies department of the University of Utrecht. Our task was to register and if needed repackage the collection (of ancient mouse teeth basically) in a database system. We had a wonderful introduction into the many difficulties of taxonomy. We also met many of the types of characters (including the scientists who don't retire). We were able to look behind the screens at several natural history museum. And my husband went on to work in Mallorca with the Myotragus collection there in his next internship (a collection that is mentioned in this book). That made most of the parts in this book familiar, and a bit too much (I'd rather read about conservation than taxonomy). Another thing that put me off was Fortey's gossip about his colleagues. I get that he's trying to describe the quirks of scientists in a museum, but I found it unnecessary to make it so personal (working all your life on just beetles is quirky enough for me). Still, for the most part I can't fault Fortey for my disappointment with the book, it is a good, if somewhat rambling description and defense of the importance of scientific research in museums. Three out of five stars, but this will probably be higher if the reader likes to read about (natural) science more."
263,0007209886,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1756815-wendell,3,"I suppose it’s inevitable to compare Dry Storeroom to Douglas Preston’s Dinosaurs in the Attic, though Fortey doesn’t come out ahead in the competition. On the other hand, his Life: A Natural History of the First Four Billion Years of Life on Earth was such a fine book that Dry Storeroom had every reason to be just as engaging. It isn’t, though, and I’m still not entirely sure why. I suspect it’s because Fortey focuses almost exclusively on the scientists who work “behind the scenes” in his museum (or who “worked” there—quite a few of them are dead), and the recounting of old gossip and long-forgotten eccentricities and peccadilloes isn’t nearly as intriguing as Fortey perhaps intended it to be. Throughout, I wanted to hear more about the science itself, about the specimens, about (for crying out loud) trilobites, which are Fortey’s area of specialty. Though he does a decent job of explaining the basics of taxonomy and nomenclature, including a discussion of the conceptual upheaval of the entire endeavor that has been occasioned by our modern capacity to trace species relationships through DNA analysis, all of it feels a tad superficial. Fortey mentions the fact that modern science has challenged the very concept of “species,” but doesn’t ever quite arrive at the point. Other than alluding to the classic “lumpers vs. splitters” feud, meanwhile, he doesn’t speak much about what all of this means for paleontologists, who are forced to erect and defend species on the basis of entirely external characteristics (given that DNA is unavailable). In light of Fortey’s interesting discussion of the complete revolution that took place in the understanding of the taxonomy of just one species of common marine snail, Littorina, following genetic analysis, or the fact that some workers claim that as few as 40% of living species of Conus are valid, one wonders what hope there might be (to take one example) for fossil Conus, a morass if ever there was one—and that’s just a single gastropod in a single (admittedly huge) phylum. I assume that Fortey and his publisher made their editorial decisions deliberately to avoid overwhelming the scientifically handicapped, but I couldn’t help but feel that the dumbing-down sometimes went too far. Fortey takes several occasions to comment on the virtual extinction of the grand scientific enterprises that gave birth to our understanding of the systematics of living things, but he’s more wistful than angry about the way changing funding priorities and budget-slashing at universities and museums have made a victim of science. Anger, indeed, would be justified. Overall, Dry Storeroom is too long on anecdote and too short on analysis of the hard issues, and “popular” begins to bleed over into the territory of the run-of-the-mill. It’s a privilege to read Fortey; it’s just that I suspect he has much more compelling things to say."
264,0007209886,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9820302-sheila,3,"I really enjoyed this chatty and clever memoir of life in the Natural History Museum in London... until the end, when Fortey criticizes the Third World for its failure to properly collect and categorize the life forms that are rapidly disappearing from earth. To Fortey, this is an unspeakable tragedy, that something should die off before it can be named and classified. At this point the reader who knows the history of British colonialism has to slap palm against forehead and think, ""Hold on. Where did Britain (or the US, or France, etc) get the $$$ to build, staff, and stuff these enormous museums?"" The answer is, by stealing land, human beings, labor, resources and intellectual property from Indigenous peoples and the very Third World Fortey criticizes.Museums, of course, are wonderful places... or are they? The American Museum of Natural History in NYC delighted me when I was a child. I was ignorant of its racist history, that museums were trophy halls for the spoils of war and conquest. Museums displayed the new possessions (feathered, footed, and finned) of the ever-curious and acquisitive European. Little did I suspect that there were crypts in which European ""scientists"" could collect and study the remains of whomever they deemed to be less than human. (The heads of Native warriors killed in battle by the US cavalry were sometimes chopped off and sold to museums.) While I was mesmerized by the gorgeous dioramas and stuffed animals, I knew nothing of the white hunters who were busy decimating the African plains of ""game."" Aren't we lucky that the animals who fell to the industrial revolution left one valiant specimen (or two) for our viewing pleasure?A couple of years ago an article appeared which pointed out that Native Americans actually had a more accurate understanding of the nature of wolves than PhD scientists. Why? Well, even though they didn't know those all-important Latin names, the Native people observed wolves in the real world. They did not shoot, dissect, or stuff them or stick them in laboratories, zoos, or museums. Native cultures respect life, and do not look upon animals and plants and minerals as ""resources"" and commodities. I am not opposed to ""science,"" but Life forms would be better served if corporations stopped destroying the planet and impoverishing billions of people. If that happened. the animals and plants would not disappear, and children - not just privileged kids in imperial nations - could actually go outside and look at them in their natural environment. A living animal is always better than a stuffed one.And can we please get rid of that racist statue in front of the AMNH? The one of Teddy Roosevelt astride a horse, towering over an African walking beside him on one side and a Native American (also on foot) on his other side? The time of colonialism and its art and science is oveer.."
265,0007209886,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43477226-todd-stockslager,4,"Behind-the-scenes look at London's Natural History Museum is an interesting peak at the ""coalface""--Fortey's term for the daily work occurring beyond and below the public galleries--of museum science. Fortey describes the main work of the Museum, and its sister institutions in other countries, as systematic taxonomy--the attempt to exhaustively categorize and collect reference examples of each species of plant, animal, and mineral.In an era of hard-to-obtain research grants and declining public funding, Fortey defends this work as valuable for several reasons:--the need to find and identify species before they are destroyed by climate change, environmental destruction, or over-harvesting.--potential beneficial uses of unknown species for the biosphere, for example expanded use of natural predators as environmentally-safe pesticides.--helping future scientific endeavors by placing each species in its proper place in the taxonomy.--and ultimately, the pure aesthetic satisfaction of knowing everything we can know about the world in which we live and upon which we are dependent.Fortey spends time walking the reader virtually through the hidden corridors of each section of the Museum and using the discussion of the physical surroundings to talk in layman's terms about the science and the history of the science. Black-and-white photos in the pages with the text and color plates in the center of the book illustrate the surroundings and the collection as Fortey describes them.But most interesting are the people who work behind the scenes. The current and past scientists, curators, clerks, Keepers, Directors, and Trustees are a diverse, intelligent, and intensely fascinating lot. After describing some of the more legendary polymaths who seemed as if they would scarcely have time to indulge in their many interests, Fortey asks in wonderment: ""Are we lesser people today, or do we expect less of ourselves?""Of course the Museum also has its share of misfits, misanthropes, recluses, shysters, and just plain crazy people deep in the hallways behind the public galleries, and Fortey seems to take special glee in describing them, many of whom he knew personally from his 30-plus years in the corridors. He writes with an understated, decidedly British wit and language. I'm guessing I missed some of his best jokes as they glanced off my tin American ear, but unless you get the opportunity to tour the hallways (which he compares to the phantasmagorical and never-ending castle in the The Gormenghast Novels) with Fortey in person, this book will be your personal tour guide."
266,0007209886,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1385097-harry-rutherford,4,"Dry Store Room No. 1: The Secret Life of the Natural History Museum is about the behind-the-scenes work at the Natural History Museum in London. Whether you find that an appealing subject for a book depends, I suppose, on your feelings about museums and/or natural history; personally I found it irresistible.The public face of the museum — animatronic dinosaurs and overexcited schoolchildren — gives relatively little sense of the scientific work that goes on behind the scenes, all of which is centred on the museum's collection of biological specimens: pressed plants, trays of pinned beetles, drawers full of bird skins or fossils, jars of starfish in alcohol. The sheer scale of these collections is hard to comprehend: the museum holds over 70 million specimens. That means every person in the UK could be given one to take home and they'd still have enough left over for everyone in Sweden. 28 million of them are insects.The collections haven't been accumulated simply through an excess of acquisitiveness, although there must be some connection between the satisfaction biologists get from collecting beetles and other people's collections of stamps, obscure soul 45s or golf memorabilia. The point of the collection is that it is a vast reference library: if you find an earwig in Burma and you're not sure whether it's a new species, you can start by checking the literature; but if all else fails, the last resort is to go to a museum, open up the drawers full of earwigs, and start peering at them through a microscope.This kind of taxonomical work — preparing specimens, describing species, working out their relationships, publishing highly technical articles about it — might seem to be complete drudgery to an outsider; it is slow, careful, precise, unglamorous. But it obviously has a hold on people, because the book is full of people who spend decades working on some particular group of organisms, retire, and then keep coming in to the museum to continue their work in retirement. Fortey himself is apparently one of them, retired in 2006 but still working away at his trilobites.The books combines a history of the museum, examples of the work done there, anecdotes about characters on the staff (not surprisingly, perhaps, there have been a few notable eccentrics) and a passionate defence of taxonomy as a valuable field of study. It's well-written, frequently entertaining, pitched at the interested amateur, and I thoroughly enjoyed it."
267,0007209886,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15743853-don,4,"I found the title of this excellent book a little misleading - I came to it expecting it to be mostly about people and their lives - the 'scandals and skulduggery', as the blurb has it. It turned out to be a great deal more than that - it is mainly about the work of the Natural History Museum (which is mostly taxonomy and curation; the classification of the natural world - living, fossil and mineral - and the preservation of examples that illustrate it), why it is important, and how the perception of that importance has changed over the years. For anyone interested in natural history, and in the great national museums devoted to it, this is essential and fascinating reading. However, there is a strong undercurrent flowing through this book that makes it rather better, and more important, than might at first appear. In charting those changes in perception of the Museum's work, shown in part through the extraordinary cast of characters that have worked there, Fortey records the progressive changes in how its work has been funded (and, increasingly, not funded) - and the political forces that have driven those changes. He ends on an optimistic note, observing that the advent of the internet, the drive to digitise historical records and the movement to publish on-line have had the effect of 'democratising' taxonomy. He envisages a return to the era of the gifted amateur who develops expertise in a chosen corner of the living world, but now including many people in the developing world who in past times would have been excluded from such activities. These amateurs would be supported by professional taxonomists whose principal tool is DNA analysis, but who would also (Fortey thinks) exercise a benign oversight to prevent the whole enterprise developing chaotically, with a proliferation of inadequately defined species, many of which might be figments of the naturalist's imagination. There is some virtue in this vision - although I suspect there is also a good deal of wishful thinking. How much better it would be if government paymasters realised for themselves the value of the work done by museums - and other government scientific agencies - which in the long term is likely to be of greater lasting significance than the plethora of 'peer-reviewed' scientific papers by which the worth of scientists and their work is currently judged.

268,0007209886,http://goodreads.com/user/show/339857-cindy,4,"Themes: natural history, conservation, research, weird scienceSetting: The Natural History Museum in London, EnglandEver read books where they talk about going up to the British Museum for the day? Well, the British Museum is now the Natural History Museum (and a few other spin-offs) and Fortey takes the reader behind the scenes for an insider's view on what really goes on in such a huge museum.Fortey started his career as a biologist back when the museum was a slightly stuffier and more serious place, and only retired a few years ago, by which time the museum had become more of an attraction and began updating exhibits to attract paying guests. But the focus remains on the science. However, his book isn't really just about the history of the museum, its contributions to English scientific understanding and so on, but rather his own experiences, acquaintances, his explorations of all the hidden little corners of the vast building, and the gossip about the many folks who work there.And what juicy gossip there is! You wouldn't think that there would be much room for racy anecdotes among the dry and serious types who work at the museum, but wow, you would be so wrong. This and the Shakespeare book both convince me that gossip was much more interesting before it started revolving around which celebrity was sleeping with whom, which had an eating disorder, and who is feuding with whom.For his format, he starts with the collections of the museum, from mammals and plants and insects (lots of great stories there) to minerals and then the nuts and bolts of how such a place is run and what it takes to keep it going. The book is full of quirky personalities, which makes it so much more fun to read. He does stick his own opinions in there about evolution and religion, about the need to preserve every single species no matter how obscure, about the damage human beings are doing to the planet, about his political views, but he keeps those parts fairly brief and gets on with the more interesting stories of people he has met and colorful characters from the museum's past. I really enjoyed one. Recommended."
269,0007209886,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39215456-chris,2,"This book nearly defeated me on three separate occasions, I resisted the urge to put the book down and walk away only because I couldn't let it beat me. Don't make the same mistake I did, don't start the book.I should start off by saying the book reads less like a nonfiction book, more like a bland textbook. Dr. Fortey could have stopped after the first word and come up with a more accurate title. This is coming from someone who typically enjoys natural history and who gets excited about the prospect of sitting in a small, stuffy little office in the bowels of some old building.The book reads like a disjointed series of tidbits, sorted roughly into categories (Zoology, Botany, Entomology, etc.) and within those tidbits, Fortey frequently gets distracted and sidetracked, offering asides and sidebars that neither add anything nor help to make the main story any more interesting or intelligible. In addition, you're bombarded with an onslaught of names that go in one ear and out the other even though each only matters for the three or four paragraphs dedicated to each individual.The book drags on, each anecdote more similar to the one before. EL Harvishire, the diatom man, was digging in West Bromwich, Staffordshire, between 1909 and 1916 and published The Catalogue of the Freshwater Diatoms of the West Bromwich Manor House Garden Pond and he told me he found forty new species there.Change the names, add a few more sentences (likely about how EL Harvishire still comes in to the NHM every Monday and how technology will be the downfall of taxonomy), then copy and paste a few hundred times and you can be the author of Dry Storeroom No. 2!I should say however, there is a reason I'm giving Dr Storeroom No. 1 2 stars instead of one. Amongst the disjointed, uninteresting pieces, every one and a while, there is a gem, something interesting. While they only last a page or two. The sprinkling of them throughout helped me to power on. Would I recommend the book on this basis? No, but if you find yourself on a deserted island with nothing but this book, just know, theres something good in there."

There are a few bits of actual science sprinkled in, but mostly as a defense of the pure gathering of knowledge and its unpredictable practical application from time to time.The early perspective on technology does little to help. Perhaps in 2006 it was difficult to view large catalogs of images on one's device, but no one today would debate that information retrieval (whether text, image, or even video) is far more efficient on digital devices that dead tree forms. And the dismissal of modern digital engineers trying to build new hierarchies as just hackers playing with software feels somewhat luddite.Not sure this belonged in the science section of the library."

It was fascinating to understand the changes of the museum over the years, the relocation of collections and changes in research and conservation within the museum. This book has been on my 'to read list' for years, after I attended a lecture by Richard Fortey at the Natural History Museum and had my copy signed. It is a fascinating book exploring the hidden world of working in a natural history museum. I liked how to book wandered around from topic to topic, like you are exploring the different hidden rooms and galleries, opening different doors to see what they contain. I enjoyed reading it, and it is something you can dip in and out of. Some chapters were more interesting than others, but there is likely to be something for everyone. I think this book would appeal to anyone interested in how museums are run or looking to work in a museum, or interested in nature and science, and how science communication has changed over the years. I would recommend this book to young adults who are interested in science and curation. "
272,0007209886,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5876945-ryan,2,"This book started off strong, with a behind the scenes tour from a veteran who has spent all his working life at this venerable institution. For natural history buffs it is obviously fascinating to be introduced to all the workings and characters, from the time the author joined in the 1960s and all the changes since. However as Fortey gets more into the details and nitty gritty of the cast and more obscure collections it is difficult to sustain interest in the goings on. I had to give it up for good nearing the final chapters after reading about the back stories of scores of ex-staff. I would highly recommend the first two or three chapters to anyone curious about what is beyond the public galleries. Naming and classifying organisms may seem boring but we cannot protect what we don't know and taxonomy is the basic foundation underlying conservation, and this book explains it all with passion."

Author Fortey, a trilobite scientist at the Natural History Museum in London, entertains with this behind the scenes history and secrets of the scholarship of the museum’s vast collections. From the 19th century rows of cabinets of curiosities to the more recent galleries that educate and entertain visitors of all ages there is much to learn in these chapters. Museum scientists uncover known and unknown species from the deep oceans, desert sands and find tiny critters under rotting logs. In the chapter on “Old World”, the author describes how and where primitive plants dating back to the dinosaurs have survived in greater numbers that animals. The most fun is found in the chapter on “Animalia” which is actually populated with past directors, department heads long departed and scores of trustees who range from royalty and heroes to imposters and villains. A book to savor and a perfect armchair escape for a summer’s day."

I liked the back-of-house history of notable characters in the museums history, and a chronology of the museum's importance (and others like it) in the world's educational theater. I will have to note, that if you read the back cover you would think that this book was going to be about various old museum exhibits with their interesting stories full of scandal and intrigue. For the most part none of that happened.I give it five stars because it promotes Science, was well written and a nice glimpse into a career from someone who genuinely cared for what he was a part of.

I was expecting a fascinating trip through the various treasures of the museum's Dry Storeroom #1. I didn't realize the title was simply a metaphor for the author's ""jumbled locker-room of memory."" The book did feature some of the museum's holdings, but it seemed more time was devoted to gossip about the peculiar habits of this scientist or that collector. Not that some of the stories weren't interesting -- I particularly liked the story of the expert on cryptogams (spore-producing plants) being recruited by the Minister of War to a team devoted to cracking cryptograms (ciphers) and ended providing an invaluable contribution specifically due to his experience with cryptogams.Another frequent topic in the book is taxonomy: its origins, its difficulties, and its importance. While I didn't mind the topic, I could certain imagine other readers skimming through a passage about a specimen that was originally in this genus but was later reclassified to that genus.Another reviewer compared the book to being at a party in conversation with someone droning on about something boring, who then suddenly says something interesting. This is an apt analogy. There were plenty of interesting bits, but there were an unfortunate number of less-than-interesting passages. Ultimately, while this book could have been so much more, it may be worth a look for anyone interested in what goes on behind the scenes at a museum."

Partly it's because so little of the book was actually about ""Dry Store Room No. 1"" (which is where they keep all the oddities) and partly it's because the author's voice didn't work for me -- he is too wealthy, too privileged, and perhaps too English (in that particular way the English have of celebrating amateurs) for me.

This is a special kind of book. A marmite book. It's a memoir of a scientist, of a museum, and of a whole era too in a lot of ways. 
 
It manages to cram a history of Taxonomy, the science of classifying things, a personal memoir, a history of the radical changes a century wrought to science in general, particularly the effect Darwin had on all fields of biology, a complete history of the incredible British Museum of Natural History, a biography of Linnaeus, discussion on the value of the colonial legacy of botanical gardens, a history of the changes to the British civil service in the past 40 odd years, a grounding in basic latin and greek, and .... well you get the idea. In fact, I think all the things I listed are covered before the half way point. There's a lot of book in this book!
 
It's a bit of a dry read, unless you're really fascinated by that kind of thing which I am.
It's chock full of hilarious anecdotes too.  You just have to slog through a bit of science to find them.
 
Like the one about the marine cryptogam expert (that's fungi) who was mistaken for a cryptogram expert (note the extra r in there) and whisked off to Bletchley park during the war - only to accidentally save the day (and possibly the war) when he was the only one who knew how to save and restore German codebooks retrieved from a sunken submarine. 
 
I read a good chunk of this, but then I was busy and set it to text-to-speech - which I really don't like usually, but I have this one posh english voice to use so I tried it out - and it actually worked pretty well. '
 
I suspect the audiobook version of this would be really great, if it's got a good narrator, and would probably get a whole 'nother star. In fact, I think I will look out for that, because there's SO much in this book, I am pretty sure I could read it another 3 times and still be finding new things.

291,0007209886,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54683202-clive-bevitt,3,A overview and history of the Natural History Museum. At times both a little dry and gossipy for me.
292,0007209886,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35553726-sara,3,"My college degree (Dutch: HBO) is in Cultural Heritage, but before they changed the name of the degree a couple of weeks before the graduation ceremony, it was museology. Basically, I've been trained for four years to work in a museum (any position really, but my preference will always be registration and documentation of collections). Even though the field I work in has nothing to do with cultural heritage or museums (I do software testing, at the moment for a logistics company), I still love it. So, any vacation my husband and I have, we visit many museums and cultural heritage sites, we watch programs and films about museums, and of course I read books about them. That's how I came to 'Dry Store Room No. 1: The Secret Life of the Natural History Museum' by Richard Fortey. Rochard Fortey is a palaeontologist specialized in the study of trilobites who has worked for the Natural History Museum in London since 1973. This book is his personal store-room of memories of all that time working in the museum. Together with explanations of the how and why of the many types of scientific research undertaken at the Natural History Museum, its history and its building he tells of the people he's worked with all these years. That makes this book a strange introduction to the specific kind of natural science undertaken at a museum (hint, it's a LOT of taxonomy) and a book filled with gossip about the strange characters that worked (under tenure) for the museum. Because of its focus on science (which is totally understandable because that is Fortey's branch of business in the museum) I was disappointed by the book. I had expected/wanted a book about the museum itself. About the collection, the collectors, the conservation, the curators and the exhibitions. Understandable from my point of view, because that is my personal interest in museums. Back in the winter of 2005/2006 my husband and I did an internship at the micro-palaeontological department of the Earth Studies department of the University of Utrecht. Our task was to register and if needed repackage the collection (of ancient mouse teeth basically) in a database system. We had a wonderful introduction into the many difficulties of taxonomy. We also met many of the types of characters (including the scientists who don't retire). We were able to look behind the screens at several natural history museum. And my husband went on to work in Mallorca with the Myotragus collection there in his next internship (a collection that is mentioned in this book). That made most of the parts in this book familiar, and a bit too much (I'd rather read about conservation than taxonomy). Another thing that put me off was Fortey's gossip about his colleagues. I get that he's trying to describe the quirks of scientists in a museum, but I found it unnecessary to make it so personal (working all your life on just beetles is quirky enough for me). Still, for the most part I can't fault Fortey for my disappointment with the book, it is a good, if somewhat rambling description and defense of the importance of scientific research in museums. Three out of five stars, but this will probably be higher if the reader likes to read about (natural) science more."
293,0007209886,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1756815-wendell,3,"I suppose it’s inevitable to compare Dry Storeroom to Douglas Preston’s Dinosaurs in the Attic, though Fortey doesn’t come out ahead in the competition. On the other hand, his Life: A Natural History of the First Four Billion Years of Life on Earth was such a fine book that Dry Storeroom had every reason to be just as engaging. It isn’t, though, and I’m still not entirely sure why. I suspect it’s because Fortey focuses almost exclusively on the scientists who work “behind the scenes” in his museum (or who “worked” there—quite a few of them are dead), and the recounting of old gossip and long-forgotten eccentricities and peccadilloes isn’t nearly as intriguing as Fortey perhaps intended it to be. Throughout, I wanted to hear more about the science itself, about the specimens, about (for crying out loud) trilobites, which are Fortey’s area of specialty. Though he does a decent job of explaining the basics of taxonomy and nomenclature, including a discussion of the conceptual upheaval of the entire endeavor that has been occasioned by our modern capacity to trace species relationships through DNA analysis, all of it feels a tad superficial. Fortey mentions the fact that modern science has challenged the very concept of “species,” but doesn’t ever quite arrive at the point. Other than alluding to the classic “lumpers vs. splitters” feud, meanwhile, he doesn’t speak much about what all of this means for paleontologists, who are forced to erect and defend species on the basis of entirely external characteristics (given that DNA is unavailable). In light of Fortey’s interesting discussion of the complete revolution that took place in the understanding of the taxonomy of just one species of common marine snail, Littorina, following genetic analysis, or the fact that some workers claim that as few as 40% of living species of Conus are valid, one wonders what hope there might be (to take one example) for fossil Conus, a morass if ever there was one—and that’s just a single gastropod in a single (admittedly huge) phylum. I assume that Fortey and his publisher made their editorial decisions deliberately to avoid overwhelming the scientifically handicapped, but I couldn’t help but feel that the dumbing-down sometimes went too far. Fortey takes several occasions to comment on the virtual extinction of the grand scientific enterprises that gave birth to our understanding of the systematics of living things, but he’s more wistful than angry about the way changing funding priorities and budget-slashing at universities and museums have made a victim of science. Anger, indeed, would be justified. Overall, Dry Storeroom is too long on anecdote and too short on analysis of the hard issues, and “popular” begins to bleed over into the territory of the run-of-the-mill. It’s a privilege to read Fortey; it’s just that I suspect he has much more compelling things to say."
294,0007209886,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9820302-sheila,3,"I really enjoyed this chatty and clever memoir of life in the Natural History Museum in London... until the end, when Fortey criticizes the Third World for its failure to properly collect and categorize the life forms that are rapidly disappearing from earth. To Fortey, this is an unspeakable tragedy, that something should die off before it can be named and classified. At this point the reader who knows the history of British colonialism has to slap palm against forehead and think, ""Hold on. Where did Britain (or the US, or France, etc) get the $$$ to build, staff, and stuff these enormous museums?"" The answer is, by stealing land, human beings, labor, resources and intellectual property from Indigenous peoples and the very Third World Fortey criticizes.Museums, of course, are wonderful places... or are they? The American Museum of Natural History in NYC delighted me when I was a child. I was ignorant of its racist history, that museums were trophy halls for the spoils of war and conquest. Museums displayed the new possessions (feathered, footed, and finned) of the ever-curious and acquisitive European. Little did I suspect that there were crypts in which European ""scientists"" could collect and study the remains of whomever they deemed to be less than human. (The heads of Native warriors killed in battle by the US cavalry were sometimes chopped off and sold to museums.) While I was mesmerized by the gorgeous dioramas and stuffed animals, I knew nothing of the white hunters who were busy decimating the African plains of ""game."" Aren't we lucky that the animals who fell to the industrial revolution left one valiant specimen (or two) for our viewing pleasure?A couple of years ago an article appeared which pointed out that Native Americans actually had a more accurate understanding of the nature of wolves than PhD scientists. Why? Well, even though they didn't know those all-important Latin names, the Native people observed wolves in the real world. They did not shoot, dissect, or stuff them or stick them in laboratories, zoos, or museums. Native cultures respect life, and do not look upon animals and plants and minerals as ""resources"" and commodities. I am not opposed to ""science,"" but Life forms would be better served if corporations stopped destroying the planet and impoverishing billions of people. If that happened. the animals and plants would not disappear, and children - not just privileged kids in imperial nations - could actually go outside and look at them in their natural environment. A living animal is always better than a stuffed one.And can we please get rid of that racist statue in front of the AMNH? The one of Teddy Roosevelt astride a horse, towering over an African walking beside him on one side and a Native American (also on foot) on his other side?

295,0007209886,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43477226-todd-stockslager,4,"Behind-the-scenes look at London's Natural History Museum is an interesting peak at the ""coalface""--Fortey's term for the daily work occurring beyond and below the public galleries--of museum science. Fortey describes the main work of the Museum, and its sister institutions in other countries, as systematic taxonomy--the attempt to exhaustively categorize and collect reference examples of each species of plant, animal, and mineral.In an era of hard-to-obtain research grants and declining public funding, Fortey defends this work as valuable for several reasons:--the need to find and identify species before they are destroyed by climate change, environmental destruction, or over-harvesting.--potential beneficial uses of unknown species for the biosphere, for example expanded use of natural predators as environmentally-safe pesticides.--helping future scientific endeavors by placing each species in its proper place in the taxonomy.--and ultimately, the pure aesthetic satisfaction of knowing everything we can know about the world in which we live and upon which we are dependent.Fortey spends time walking the reader virtually through the hidden corridors of each section of the Museum and using the discussion of the physical surroundings to talk in layman's terms about the science and the history of the science. Black-and-white photos in the pages with the text and color plates in the center of the book illustrate the surroundings and the collection as Fortey describes them.But most interesting are the people who work behind the scenes. The current and past scientists, curators, clerks, Keepers, Directors, and Trustees are a diverse, intelligent, and intensely fascinating lot. After describing some of the more legendary polymaths who seemed as if they would scarcely have time to indulge in their many interests, Fortey asks in wonderment: ""Are we lesser people today, or do we expect less of ourselves?""Of course the Museum also has its share of misfits, misanthropes, recluses, shysters, and just plain crazy people deep in the hallways behind the public galleries, and Fortey seems to take special glee in describing them, many of whom he knew personally from his 30-plus years in the corridors. He writes with an understated, decidedly British wit and language. I'm guessing I missed some of his best jokes as they glanced off my tin American ear, but unless you get the opportunity to tour the hallways (which he compares to the phantasmagorical and never-ending castle in the The Gormenghast Novels) with Fortey in person, this book will be your personal tour guide."
296,0007209886,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1385097-harry-rutherford,4,"Dry Store Room No. 1: The Secret Life of the Natural History Museum is about the behind-the-scenes work at the Natural History Museum in London. Whether you find that an appealing subject for a book depends, I suppose, on your feelings about museums and/or natural history; personally I found it irresistible.The public face of the museum — animatronic dinosaurs and overexcited schoolchildren — gives relatively little sense of the scientific work that goes on behind the scenes, all of which is centred on the museum's collection of biological specimens: pressed plants, trays of pinned beetles, drawers full of bird skins or fossils, jars of starfish in alcohol. The sheer scale of these collections is hard to comprehend: the museum holds over 70 million specimens. That means every person in the UK could be given one to take home and they'd still have enough left over for everyone in Sweden. 28 million of them are insects.The collections haven't been accumulated simply through an excess of acquisitiveness, although there must be some connection between the satisfaction biologists get from collecting beetles and other people's collections of stamps, obscure soul 45s or golf memorabilia. The point of the collection is that it is a vast reference library: if you find an earwig in Burma and you're not sure whether it's a new species, you can start by checking the literature; but if all else fails, the last resort is to go to a museum, open up the drawers full of earwigs, and start peering at them through a microscope.This kind of taxonomical work — preparing specimens, describing species, working out their relationships, publishing highly technical articles about it — might seem to be complete drudgery to an outsider; it is slow, careful, precise, unglamorous. But it obviously has a hold on people, because the book is full of people who spend decades working on some particular group of organisms, retire, and then keep coming in to the museum to continue their work in retirement. Fortey himself is apparently one of them, retired in 2006 but still working away at his trilobites.The books combines a history of the museum, examples of the work done there, anecdotes about characters on the staff (not surprisingly, perhaps, there have been a few notable eccentrics) and a passionate defence of taxonomy as a valuable field of study. It's well-written, frequently entertaining, pitched at the interested amateur, and I thoroughly enjoyed it."
297,0007209886,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15743853-don,4,"I found the title of this excellent book a little misleading - I came to it expecting it to be mostly about people and their lives - the 'scandals and skulduggery', as the blurb has it. It turned out to be a great deal more than that - it is mainly about the work of the Natural History Museum (which is mostly taxonomy and curation; the classification of the natural world - living, fossil and mineral - and the preservation of examples that illustrate it), why it is important, and how the perception of that importance has changed over the years. For anyone interested in natural history, and in the great national museums devoted to it, this is essential and fascinating reading. However, there is a strong undercurrent flowing through this book that makes it rather better, and more important, than might at first appear. In charting those changes in perception of the Museum's work, shown in part through the extraordinary cast of characters that have worked there, Fortey records the progressive changes in how its work has been funded (and, increasingly, not funded) - and the political forces that have driven those changes. He ends on an optimistic note, observing that the advent of the internet, the drive to digitise historical records and the movement to publish on-line have had the effect of 'democratising' taxonomy. He envisages a return to the era of the gifted amateur who develops expertise in a chosen corner of the living world, but now including many people in the developing world who in past times would have been excluded from such activities. These amateurs would be supported by professional taxonomists whose principal tool is DNA analysis, but who would also (Fortey thinks) exercise a benign oversight to prevent the whole enterprise developing chaotically, with a proliferation of inadequately defined species, many of which might be figments of the naturalist's imagination. There is some virtue in this vision - although I suspect there is also a good deal of wishful thinking. How much better it would be if government paymasters realised for themselves the value of the work done by museums - and other government scientific agencies - which in the long term is likely to be of greater lasting significance than the plethora of 'peer-reviewed' scientific papers by which the worth of scientists and their work is currently judged.

Well, the British Museum is now the Natural History Museum (and a few other spin-offs) and Fortey takes the reader behind the scenes for an insider's view on what really goes on in such a huge museum.Fortey started his career as a biologist back when the museum was a slightly stuffier and more serious place, and only retired a few years ago, by which time the museum had become more of an attraction and began updating exhibits to attract paying guests. But the focus remains on the science. However, his book isn't really just about the history of the museum, its contributions to English scientific understanding and so on, but rather his own experiences, acquaintances, his explorations of all the hidden little corners of the vast building, and the gossip about the many folks who work there.And what juicy gossip there is! You wouldn't think that there would be much room for racy anecdotes among the dry and serious types who work at the museum, but wow, you would be so wrong. This and the Shakespeare book both convince me that gossip was much more interesting before it started revolving around which celebrity was sleeping with whom, which had an eating disorder, and who is feuding with whom.For his format, he starts with the collections of the museum, from mammals and plants and insects (lots of great stories there) to minerals and then the nuts and bolts of how such a place is run and what it takes to keep it going. The book is full of quirky personalities, which makes it so much more fun to read. He does stick his own opinions in there about evolution and religion, about the need to preserve every single species no matter how obscure, about the damage human beings are doing to the planet, about his political views, but he keeps those parts fairly brief and gets on with the more interesting stories of people he has met and colorful characters from the museum's past. I really enjoyed one. Recommended."

Don't make the same mistake I did, don't start the book.I should start off by saying the book reads less like a nonfiction book, more like a bland textbook. Dr. Fortey could have stopped after the first word and come up with a more accurate title. This is coming from someone who typically enjoys natural history and who gets excited about the prospect of sitting in a small, stuffy little office in the bowels of some old building.The book reads like a disjointed series of tidbits, sorted roughly into categories (Zoology, Botany, Entomology, etc.) and within those tidbits, Fortey frequently gets distracted and sidetracked, offering asides and sidebars that neither add anything nor help to make the main story any more interesting or intelligible. In addition, you're bombarded with an onslaught of names that go in one ear and out the other even though each only matters for the three or four paragraphs dedicated to each individual.The book drags on, each anecdote more similar to the one before. EL Harvishire, the diatom man, was digging in West Bromwich, Staffordshire, between 1909 and 1916 and published The Catalogue of the Freshwater Diatoms of the West Bromwich Manor House Garden Pond and he told me he found forty new species there.Change the names, add a few more sentences (likely about how EL Harvishire still comes in to the NHM every Monday and how technology will be the downfall of taxonomy), then copy and paste a few hundred times and you can be the author of Dry Storeroom No. 2!I should say however, there is a reason I'm giving Dr Storeroom No. 1 2 stars instead of one. Amongst the disjointed, uninteresting pieces, every one and a while, there is a gem, something interesting. While they only last a page or two. The sprinkling of them throughout helped me to power on. Would I recommend the book on this basis? No, but if you find yourself on a deserted island with nothing but this book, just know, theres something good in there."
