In ‘Trials of Life’ the third work in the trilogy, Attenborough take us on a journey around globe telling us about ‘Ethology’ or the objective study of animal behavior, in his signature style of flair and simplicity.David Attenborough, the ever curious observer of the natural world“My first assignment obliged me to stand knee-deep in bat droppings, in a cave in Borneo. I found that much preferable.”
David Attenborough – ever dedicated to travels & observing the nature – when he resigned his administrative position in BBC in 1979 for pursuing his passion for filming & writing made this remark, which underline his love for being in the field observing the wonders of nature. His curiosity and passion to learn and the penchant nature in which he shares the results of his study to his viewers/ readers without being too much academic makes his works easy to follow and understand.The ‘Life’ TrilogyThe ‘Life’ series of documentaries and companion books, which cover an entire spectrum of living things spread across the whole globe, offers an expansive impression of our natural world and are widely acclaimed for the extreme simplicity of the presentation. While ‘Life on Earth’, the first work in the series, concentrated on the development of animal life from it’s beginning, in ‘ The Living Planet’, Attenborough traces evolution through a study on how animals physically adapted their bodies in accordance with their environment. In ‘The Trials of Life’, the final part of the trilogy, Attenborough travels across the globe inspecting the how & why of animal behavior.The Trials of Life or ‘A study in animal behavior’The dust cover jacket of the Hardbound edition, with its photograph of a ‘killer whale preying on sea-lion cubs on a lonely beach in Patagonia’, itself can spark the interest in a nature enthusiast by offering a sneak peek at the theme of this volume – the ways in which animals behave and utilize their bodies for survival.While making the study of animal behavior, Attenborough doesn’t limit his selection to any particular geographical location or to any specific life forms; he inspects a whole range of representatives from the animal kingdom – mammals, insects, reptiles, fish, birds – from all over the globe and painstakingly observe and tell us about the behavioral patterns of the animals and how they use their bodies to guide the various phases of their life.Like the other works in the series the book is neatly organized into a sequence of chapters, which inspect a specific phase of life for every living beings – like birth, growing up, hunting, courting etc – and concentrate in great detail how animals tackle ‘the trials of life’ at each stage by adapting their behavior towards survival.It tells us that the ultimate aim in each of these behavioral patterns is oriented towards survival and eventually passing their genes to the next generation.“All organisms are ultimately concerned to pass on their genes to the next generation. That, it would seem to a dispassionate and clinical observer is the prime objective of their existence. In the course of achieving it, they must face a whole succession of problems as they go through their lives. These problems are fundamentally the same whether the animals are spiders or squirrels, mice or monkeys, llamas or lobsters. The solutions developed by different species are hugely varied and often astounding. But they are all the more comprehensible and engaging for they are the trials that we also face ourselves.”
In the Initial chapter titled ‘Arriving’, we are presented with that amazing phase of life called ‘Birth’, by inspecting some of the fascinating ways in which life forms comes into the world. In one of the most profligate of strategies adopted by a species for survival we meet the crimson crab, which is endemic to the Christmas Island, and their saga of annual mass migration from forest through the islands towns to reach the sea for spawning.Red Crabs migrating to the sea, Christmas IslandIn this perilous and costly journey we come to know about a tiny life form and it’s behavioral strategy entirely based on sheer numbers –millions of crabs spawning at the same time with each crab producing about a hundred thousand eggs -, designed to beat the multitudinous hazards they face for their offspring in the form of predatory fish and secluded nature of the Island.A Malleefowl [Source]In the same chapter we come across the Malleefowl living in the open scrub country of Southern Australia and their complex process of keeping the eggs warm using a primitive form of incubator that they make from decaying vegetation and sand. The whole process is very complex and lengthy and is aimed in keeping the eggs close to 34° C for several months. Attenborough explains this process in great detail and the science involved in it that the birds perform like clockwork will amaze the reader.In the chapter ‘Finding Food’ the reader will make acquaintance with the ‘Honeypot Ants’ of central Australia and their unique way of tackling the problem of storing honey for yearlong use. They use a number of ants – specialized workers known as repletes – virtually as jars.The repletes used as jars among Honeypot ants [Source]These repletes are kept in galleries down the ground and are fed with the honeydew and nectar collected by worker ants. A fully ‘stored’ honeypot ant’s abdomen can grow to the size of a large pea and they cling on to the roof of the galleries as storage tanks; when needed they regurgitate the honey droplets for the use of the whole ant nest.These are just three random animal behaviors I picked from this book for the purpose of sampling and I can assure you that it contains hundreds of more such mesmerizing stories related to the mechanisms of survival from the animal world.Altogether the ‘Trials of Life’ – and the entire ‘Life’ series – is a very good introduction to natural history, which apart from the tonnage of information it presents is further enriched by the energetic, ever curious mind of Attenborough. The book can delight even a general reader with no interest in natural history and its studies just due to the sheer simplicity of the narrative and the stunning quality of the photographs."
1,0316057517,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42508-greg,4,"A short review, a longish aside with some personal ramblings and pictures of animals!I really really liked this book. I thought about giving it five stars, but because I'm class-ocentric and I enjoyed Life of Mammals better, I felt my star ratings should show this distinction. Currently, or as current as when I was reading this, I am reading two animal books. One was great and one so far sucks. This is the great one. Note: If David Attenborough would make a beautiful book / five part BBC documentary on Foxes it might be my favorite book / documentary ever madeAs the title suggests, this book is about the various trails that confront animals at the various stages of their life. The book is laid out in chapters starting with the difficulties and unique ways different sorts of animals come into the world, and ends with a chapter on fucking (with some pictures, (as a note dragonfly fucking is much more involved than the picture would lead you to believe. The male dragonfly produces it's sperm from it's sex organs (like one would guess) and then transfers the sperm to a sort of surrogate 'penis' in it's neck. Then when mating he sticks his organic dildo of sorts into the female dragonfly. This fake penis is sort of like the strap-on dildo thing from Seven and makes descriptions of a cat's penis sound pleasant by comparison. It has all kinds of hooks and barbs on it which the male dragonfly uses to 'clean' out the female of any previous dragonfly man juice, he does this for about nineteen minutes and then takes about a minute to leave his own deposit of dragonfly dna nectar. Needless to say, but Sir David Attenborough described this in a much more tasteful manner than I did)). The middle chapters deal with other aspects of life, such as fighting, communicating, eating, navigating, courting, living in proximity to others, and it's awe-insprining all the diversity and ingenuity out there in the animal world for overcoming all of the different trials living organisms face in life. A favorite animal fact from the book? I don't know if this is a favorite but it amused me greatly, since I'm immature. Female red-backed salamanders choose their mates by going through piles of shit that male red-backed salamanders leave in front of their burrow openings. The female inspects the feces looking for the male who has the richest diet, and prefers a mate who dines heavily on succulent termites as opposed to salamanders who chow down on the Chef Boyardee meal of plain out ants. What did I learn from this book that helps me understand a baffling part of the way people interact, and subsequently made me realize yet another way why I'm a total failure in a Darwinian sense? The way guys shit-talk each other and go through verbal nonsense when they are gearing up to fight one another. I never got this. But I see now that it can be explained as a ritualized (albeit retarded ritual) biological response to dealing with another male in a confrontational manner. All sorts of animals have all kinds of threatening ways of acting when they are confronted with a foe that are used to stave off conflict, to show they are tougher without having to actually go through with fighting. From a survival point of view this behavioral 'shit-talking' allows for conflicts to be resolved, the weaker one slinking off without real violence being escalated. This allows the stronger animal to show superiority without the actual risks of winning but getting injured or wasting precious energy in a fight. A lot of animals have some kind of pre-fight ritual that serves to prove who is really the dominate one. So, in a modern day human perspective, this means that whoever is the bigger shit-talking retard can 'win' the fight by getting the other person to slink off thinking that the bigger retard really is going to do all of the nonsensical shit they are promising to do when they puff out their chests and start 'fronting'. I don't think I could ever take part in this verbally retarded smack-talk fest that guys do, it would embarrass me too much. I'd most likely just walk away from the person, thus giving them the 'victory' which in the wild means giving in to the dominant male who now has the better territory or the the right to mate with more females or whatever, which means the retards DNA is more likely to get passed on than me. If I didn't walk away, or if I really wanted to fight someone I would be more likely to just attack them then engage in the shit-talking, which also from an evolutionary point of view isn't good. I'd be more likely to get hurt in some way and risk my chances of survival and passing on my DNA by fighting instead of shit-talking, even if I won; and more importantly I'd probably get into fights without first really sizing up an opponent and leave myself more open to getting hurt by taking on someone who could be me grievous bodily harm. Not that situations to fight present themselves to me on any sort of regular basis (it's actually been years and years since I've had some retard shit-talk at me and try to start something), but just realizing what my responses would be I realize yet another way that I'm most likely an evolutionary failure. If you've read through all this nonsense you deserve a treat. Here are some animals!Satin bower bird and his nest.Red-backed salamander[image error]Sea-horse giving birthGiraffes necking (this is their own particular form of shit-talking before an actual fight)And baby foxes, because there were no foxes in the book......

2,0316057517,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7019761-cindy,5,"Excellent examination of the natural world and animal behavior. The narrative is organized well and looks at animal behavior starting with birth and ending with 'continuing the line' (sexual behavior). In between, there's a look at growing up, finding food, hunting, making a home, living together, fighting, friends and rivals, talking, and courting. It is a fascinating look at the wide variety of animals and the adaptations that they've made to their environment. The photos are lovely and illustrate well the author's points. This book leaves you in awe of the wonders of the animal world.Quote to remember:All organisms are ultimately concerned to pass on their genes to the next generation. That, it would seem to a dispassionate and clinical observer, is the prime objective of their existence. In the course of achieving it, they must face a whole succession of problems as they go through their lives.

4,0316057517,http://goodreads.com/user/show/940221-amy,4,Really interesting. This is the companion book to the documentary series that came out when I was a teen. I love David Attenborough!

6,0316057517,http://goodreads.com/user/show/80346806-gareth,5,"Another excellent book by David Attenborough. Again, easy to read but still very informative, getting to find out about creatures I hadn't heard of before, as well as more information on creatures I did know. Compared to the Living Planet, I also found this a lot easier to read in a short period, as the different chapters followed naturally on from each other, whereas with Living Planet there was more of a clear demarcation between chapters."
7,0316057517,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20693853-alison-swearingen,4,"Read this book with my dear friend Maria as a book club, and it was super interesting. Basically like an animal life documentary series but in book form, with plenty of big pictures. I thought it was well organized and flowed well, and described the animal actions in a way that made it easy to visualize. Definitely would’ve been cool as a tv series but the book was pretty fun too."
8,0316057517,http://goodreads.com/user/show/115980034-mrs-f-s-petersen,5,Loved this. David Attenborough 's books are always a joy to read. Pictures are excellent and add much to the understanding of animal behaviour.
9,0316057517,http://goodreads.com/user/show/119303030-book-collector,5,"The book of the tv series. Brilliant. There's not much to say and I'm going to put this review on most of the other books in the series. Why? Well because the books follow a simple pattern. They are all fascinating to read, filled with gorgeous photos and brilliantly written by one of the most fascinating and influential people of our lives. The wonderful David attenborough. With the reprint of life on earth I'm so hoping they reprint more of his books as I'd love to have new copies of these well thumbed natural history volumes."
10,0316057517,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67016485-sophie-crane,5,"'Trials of Life' is another superb book by Attenborough looking at animal and plant behaviour that aids in their survival. Like all of his books his style is extremely easy to read and you are soon drawn in to the fascinating lives of the various animals he describes. Throughout the book you get one page of text and another full page of the most stunning photography you are ever likely to see and occasionally you'll get a double spread for a particularly impressive image. This looks at animal behaviour in relation to eating, reproduction, fighting, finding shelter, making friends and a whole range of other traits besides. As part of the Attenborough collection this can't be missed, but it is well worth a look in it's own right and makes for a couple days of informative and completely engrossing reading. The wonder of nature has rarely been so well presented, and yet we've become used to that from Attenborough and anything less would be a let down. This more than lives up to this high standard."
11,0316057517,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1768003-sam,5,"An exciting and indepth look it how life on earth begins, survives and passes on its knowledge to the next generation, this book looks at the different adaptations, skills and methods used by species and species groups to survive and pass on its genes. Attenborough takes the reader through life chapter by chapter revealing the different styles and methods used for each with descriptive and readable language without losing any of the drama or knowledge that comes with it. This book covers everything from communicating, mating and birth to feeding, hunting and finding shelter. The photography is superb and supports the text brilliantly and brings Attenborough's words to life. An utterly enthralling read, whether your a natural world beginner, expert or in between."
12,0316057517,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66184707-adz-s,4,"Had this book a long time, finally got round to finishing it. Clearly our world is changing and the natural world is taking a hammering, this book focuses on the behavioural aspects of many animals which we coexist with. There is much to appreciate here, but it’s also apparent the the change in style of more current works with greater emphasis on what we humans can do to prevent the loss of habitats and our influence on them."
13,0316057517,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18484922-dark-draco,5,"This book is excellent. It charts the trials that animals have to face during their life, from growing up, to finding food and a mate, from defence to making a home. It is fascinating stuff, especially the amazing colour plates that are included throughout the text. And although some of the stuff Attenborough is describing is pretty complicated, it comes across in a good, easy way, so the reading of this book is a pleasure rather than a chore. Well worth the read. "
14,0316057517,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24572104-frank-ashe,4,David Attenborough is magnificent. This book is at the level of his previous works. It doesn't get 5 stars simply because he's been consistently so good that 5 stars has to be reserved for something more than exceptional!
15,0316057517,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4334166-noah-jensen,5,"this book is realy interesting, i love the anumal kingdom so this book is perfect 4 me. 2 interesting facts i learned 2day kangaros have a musle in their pouch that closes in watter so the baby is in no danger of drouning, and that a baby goat is a kid."
16,0316057517,http://goodreads.com/user/show/110311-nilu-r,5,"If you love animals and natural history, this is a great light read. It is written well, and organized like a nature show. I have re-read this book several times, enjoying it each time."
