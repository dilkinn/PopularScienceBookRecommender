0,0060760222,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26552534-greg-brozeit,5,"Intellectually thrilling: how else can one sum up this book? Watson’s subject is no less grand than to explain how German influences have, in countless ways, laid the foundation of, as Isaiah Berlin wrote, many of the “concepts and categories” that underlie the prevailing intellectual assumptions in the modern, Western world. The wide spectrum of information he writes about could teeter on the brink of devolving into semantic clutter or, worse, a rhetorical “book of lists.” Instead, Watson writes with such an engaging fluidity to elevate his subject to something more than a mere history of ideas; it approaches the level of a compelling novel.Watson defines “German” in the expansive sense of where and when German language and influence was most pervasive. Most of the first half of the book is a sweeping overview of the age “between doubt and Darwin.” The “advent of religious doubt” began with Newton, Galileo, Copernicus and Kepler. However, it accelerated with the birth of historicism and “modern scholarship” in Germany in the mid-18th century. This would have a profound impact on the emerging German ideals of Bildung—“in essence it refers to the inner development of the individual, a process of fulfillment though education and knowledge, in effect a secular search for perfection, representing progress and refinement both in knowledge and in moral terms.” This idea was formalized and consolidated with Wilhelm von Humboldt’s—the brother of the more celebrated Alexander—creation of the University in Berlin, which would become the model for all modern universities and scholarship.Another key idea, first posited by Johann Gottfried von Herder, was Kultur, which “refers essentially to intellectual, artistic and religious facts” that bind people. The non-German conception of culture grew to include politics, economics and history. Watson defines the distinction to better understand how Germans viewed themselves, but uses the latter to make his arguments. What followed is an astounding scope of achievement that includes art history, philosophy, music, literature, geology, chemistry, physics, biology, medicine, industrialization, and business. Throughout his narrative, Watson also places the discoveries and influence in geographical and temporal context with chapters on Vienna, Berlin and Munich and the roles each city played as centers of various activities and trends.Watson’s argument thankfully does not get bogged down in historical events; his is based on the “whys” behind the “how and when” of history. We learn about the changing attitudes of elites during World War I. Although the primacy of German intellectual influences lasted until 1933, the decline began after the World War I when “Germans were banned from international science conferences…not offered visiting fellowships, and their research was not incorporated into leading journals.” Artistic and literary influence, however, continued to flourish right up until the Nazi takeover of power. Then, as Watson paraphrases Steven Remy, “scholarship…rejected ‘objectivity’ [and] denied that scholarship served intangible notions of truth for truth’s sake, insisting that German scholarship must serve the ‘Volk’”. The Nazi era stunted German scholarship in a way that took decades to begin to recover. Even good science like linking cancer to tobacco and diet was set back and had to be relearned. Post World War II Germany has continued to be tainted by the Nazi experience, even now, more than 70 years after its demise.This is the primary reason Watson chose to write this book. In an incredibly well-argued introduction that outlines his thesis, he laments how in modern day Great Britain what little understanding of Germany exists is mired in the twelve year history of the Third Reich. The rich history and influence on the world of what happened in the two centuries prior to the war and the recovery and establishment of a strong democratic tradition are largely ignored. He then takes more than 700 pages to lay out the case of how German thinking has changed the world forever. His case is not blinded by a misplaced chauvinism. It is possible to read just the introduction and conclusion to permanently change one’s view of The German Genius, but one would sadly miss the interesting journey that connects them."
1,0060760222,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2031057-ugh,5,"Why do we read and write, you and I? Partly it's because we want to better ourselves. This is what people do - or what the kind of people you and I want to know do, anyway - we learn new instruments and languages, we travel, we try new things. (Or we like to think we do.)But why do we do this? The answer may seem self-evident: who doesn't want to be ""better"", whatever that means? Who doesn't want to be more like the people they admire, and more liked by them? Or maybe you feel you have an inner drive: if you didn't try all these new things, you'd go crazy.But have you ever stopped to think about the context for this behaviour? Whether people everywhere do it, and always have?That is the concern of the first half of Peter Watson's The German Genius - or, as I like to think of it: After God, ""Aargh, modernity!"". Or, even more facetiously: Why we blog.Watson tells us that the drive for self-improvement originated largely in pre-unified Germany, born out of the speculative philosophy of such titans as Kant and Hegel that arose to fill the growing hole left by declining Christianity and its message of ""Do this, because I say so"".Why in Germany? Religion in Germany had been more inward anyway, as a result of Luther's protestantism returning religion to the people from the control of the church (see the novel Q, ostensibly but not really written by a former AC Milan footballer named Luther Blissett). Plus, it was the German Wilhelm von Humboldt who essentially invented the modern university, with the idea that scholars should conduct original research, and, owing to the support of Friedrich Wilhelm III, there were far more universities, and much more literacy, in Germany than places like France or Great Britain.Kant, Hegel et al posited that in the absence of an afterlife or divinity, the purpose of life must be to better oneself, a concept that came to be known as bildung. Also, by bettering oneself, one also bettered those around oneself in one's community.Thus, the next 100 years or so gave rise to such cultural colossi as Haydn, Beethoven, Mozart, Schubert and Wagner, whose music differed from that of Handel and Bach in expressing inner concepts related to the life of man, rather than religious ones, plus Goethe, creator of the Bildungsroman, in which improvement (in the eyes of God or of man) comes only through effort on the part of the individual.Thanks, Germany!But then come modernity and alienation, and the second half of Watson's book, which addresses the question of whether German idealism had to lead to authoritarianism.As Watson makes clear (borrowing on the work of others, as he's quick to point out the whole book heavily does), the idea of evolution did not originate with Darwin. Bildung is itself evolution applied to one's own character, for example. But Darwin accounted for evolution scientifically, realising it comes from overpopulation and struggle to survive and reproduce. Thus (broadly) was born the age of science.Over the next generation or so, we have the dawn of organic chemistry and the age of cellular and molecular biology, so many of the discoveries coming from German universities and institutes. We mechanise and urbanise. We have mass-production.Then comes the Franco-Prussian war and German unification.Scientification continues. Education becomes less humanistic. Alongside this we have Nietzsche, telling us nothing matters anymore.Then World War I, partly a war of now-struggling German kultur vs British mercantilism and mere civility. We have mechanised, indiscriminate killing on a scale never seen before. Germany and kultur are dealt a terrible blow, although nobody really wins.Then Weimar and the rise of low-brow culture, followed by Einstein's relativity, Pauli's uncertainty, Godel's revelation that there are things that can never be known, atonalism in music, expressionism in art, cultural pessimism and economic plight.Then National Socialists, with their incoherent but powerful message that everything had gone wrong and a return to classical culture was needed, and their racism, their belief that others were responsible for the way things were and that these were people who could never be truly cultured, as only true Germans could.And what came next, which you already know.And then the aftermath: a slow coming to terms, Heidegger and reassessment, Habermas and what now in the age of ongoing alienation and environmental profligacy.I haven't done justice to The German Genius there, obviously. It's 365,000 words, and an awful lot of concepts that were entirely new to me. It's a lot to get your head around.At times it reads like an encyclopaedia, and could perhaps have done with being a bit trimmer. But part of its point is that there is so much more to Germany that the Nazis, despite what British TV schedulers might think, hence there's a lot of chronicling of German achievement even when it's not essential to the narrative.TGG is monumental in every sense, and probably the most informative and enlightening book I've ever read. I'd read it again, if only it wasn't so big. Bloody overachieving Germans, nicking all the sun-loungers..."
2,0060760222,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26177059-mt,5,"I went for a long trip to Germany in 2013 and wanted to get a bit of backstory on the place (asides from what we're all told about all that unpleasantness in the early part of last century). This isn't a book about redemption, or about citing Germany's previous contributions to industry, medicine, and the arts. Watson could attempt to dissect Germany's troubled legacy, or how the nation is viewed, but such a discussion would be outside the book's focus (and would be arguably as long and detailed a read as the book is). What it instead does is sets Germany's importance in contributing towards civilisation as a whole in a variety of areas. The book starts somewhere in the formation of the first modern universities waaay back in the day, and continues through until nearly modern times. This is an excellent read, well-written, cogent and making great points all over the place. For me it was an excellent background into the industrial and scientific formation of modern Germany, something that is often overlooked. However, don't think it helps to name-drop any choice bits once you get to Germany. I met a girl from the town that Zeiss, this awesome lensmaker was from, and she didn't know a thing about it. 10/10 book for the read, 1/10 for any tidbits to impress tidy German girls with. "
3,0060760222,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32553593-elliott-bignell,5,"This was perhaps the best reading surprise I have had in recent years. A work of startling erudition, it attempts and in my opinion succeeds in describing the spirit and achievements of an entire culture across its full breadth. And what a culture! Directed at the war-obsessed English-speaking readership, it does not dodge the question of how the world's perhaps most advanced culture of the time gave birth to Nazism but tries to trace the differences and proclivities that made this, of all places, the birthplace.The author treats of music, painting, architecture, literature, biology, physics, engineering, mathematics, economics and philosophy. This list is probably not exhaustive and Watson seems to speak with authority wherever I myself have the knowledge to judge. In virtually all these fields, Germans have made decisive contributions and often enough led the field. It was said by Churchill's secretary that the allies won the Second World War because we had better German scientists than the Germans did. He was not exaggerating, and I would only add that very many were German Jews.At any rate, the rise of Nazism led to a prolific diaspora of German speakers, products of the most advanced university system of the 19th Century, as the regime sought to sanitise artistic and political discourse, rid music of ""degeneracy"" and to move against the Jews who had played so great a role in the advances of the previous century. The result was catastrophic for the regime's chances of beating the combined resources of the British Empire and Asian Russia backed up by their own nation's brains, but it has shaped our own minds more deeply than many would admit. Just to name a couple of examples, the Chicago School of economics and the entire field of psychoanalysis are almost entirely shaped by German minds.The question that will probably never lose its hold on British - in large part ancestrally germanic - readers is, ""What about the war?"" Well, both wars. And one World Cup. (Doo-dah, doo-dah.) This account should firstly make clear the narrowness and puerility of this obsession. The book does not settle on a single, definitive explanation, but it highlights a set of circumstances that render Germany arguably unique, and which may comprise a predisposition: The spirit of Prussia's Iron Kingdom is part of it, with its cherishing of the martial spirit and pride in ""entrepreneurialism"" over contempt for English-speaking mercantilism. The Romantic dream of the isolated figure in an empty, native landscape is another factor, as it brought the soil to ""blood and soil"" nationalism. As Popper argued at length, historicism, a strong feature of German philosophy, contributed to both Nazism and Marxism - a product of yet another German mind. The Nietzschean conception of the moral ""superman"" fits into the picture. And of course the Weimar Republic saw the rise of a vicious conservatism that birthed a yearning to ""get our country back"" and to purify art of modernist ""degeneracy"". German classical scholarship is visible in the neo-classical brutality of Nazi architecture, its primacy in cinema and communications technology must have played a role in Nazi mastery of mass propaganda, expertise in mythography and Germanic sagas and fables contributed to the incoherent blend of Christianity and pagan heroism which Hitler concocted to provide a purely Aryan form of state religion. This amounts to a complex and hard-to-falsify picture, but what can one expect? The demonic energy of fascism is a true puzzle in the land of Goethe, Freud, Mozart and Einstein, and these answers seem to me to create a convincing whole.A work of genius about a genius."
4,0060760222,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5953767-tobias,4,"What an enormous book 850 pages of accounts of German intellectuals. Took me more than three months to read. But its enormous for a reason. Its a book with a huge agenda to bring to light the great German thinkers (from Goethe to Habermas) who lie at the heart of so much of modern thought and, partly because of the Nazis and partly because of Anglo-American-centrism have been unjustly overlooked. Having said that the book also charted where German thought began to go wrong at first very slowly but on a very deep level beginning in the failed revolution of 1848 and eventually leading to the collapse of the Weimar Republic in 1933 and its eventual revival in the 1968 to 1989 period. "
5,0060760222,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5869071-dave,5,"Should have been titled ""The Unchecked German Genius."" Watson sets out to correct what he views as an error to define Germany simply by the thirteen years of the Third Reich. As he so well demonstrates in painstaking detail, Germans of the 19th Century led the world in nearly everything, from science to math to music, chemistry, industry and, most notably, philosophy. As he does so, he carefully lays out how that philosophy, culture and political view of itself very much provided the foundation that brought on the Third Reich, the Holocaust and two world wars that changed history. It really was the Germans and not just a circumstance of history. And, most surprising, Hitler really had no new ideas. He just brought bits and pieces of old ones to fruition. Ironically, as Watson describes the German genius, he also proves up the reason why Germans deserve very much to be defined by those thirteen years. Now, if the Greeks are correct, and Germany is again taking over Europe, these 800 pages may be a good way of understanding just why Germans do what they do, this time hopefully without the evil goofballs that brought it to ruination the last time around."
6,0060760222,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12658-lydia,5,"Somewhere along the line after writing the introduction and title, Watson forgot his mission to explain how Germany became a dominant economic European country after 1945. Chapter 1 starts with year 1747. Not to be deterred, I waded through 713 pages to get to post-WWII. I took note of priests, architects, musicians and scientists. The changes in thought leading up to 1938 are useful, and answered lots of questions for me. Watson is an English journalist with an academic bent hoping to educate all--he writes beautifully. This was recommended to me by a German architect. Once I gave up my desire to learn about government, industry, culture and changes in Germany over the last 50 years, I really enjoyed this book. "
7,0060760222,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4705812-coulter,5,"This was an amazing whirlwind tour of, well, German genius from the death of Bach in 1750 to the present: not only the artists, writers, historians, and philosophers that typically people the pages of cultural histories, but also scientists, engineers, businessmen, and doctors. If it has a fault, it's that Watson tries to cover as many people as possible, so occasionally it feels a bit like you're reading one encyclopedia entry after another. But that's more than outweighed by the overall arc of the book, which not only gives a great refresher course on philosophers like Kant, Hegel, Nietzsche, Heidegger, and Habermas (which sticks well in the brain because Watson is so successful in anchoring them in general Western cultural development), but also highlights large-scale traits particularly characteristic of 19C and early 20C Germany, notably a well-educated middle class, supported by first-rate research institutions, inclined more to Innerlichkeit (""inwardness"") than to political activism, and devoted to a holistic approach to educational self-betterment, i.e. Bildung. The way he describes it, the entire country sounds like it would be an INTJ in a Myers-Briggs test, which is no doubt one reason the book appealed to me so much. He also does a convincing job of showing how all this led to the catastrophe of the Nazis. One of those Hydra-like books that leaves you with a much longer to-read list than you started out with..."

I think he is, even considering the compromise of breadth and deepness over the different subjects that is always a characteristic of these books. I kept wanting to know more about this or that character/subject, and I will, as Watson enticed me. And that's the main point of the book: let you know how little you know, and then acting accordingly. "

12,0060760222,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2736187-lucsly,5,"An incredibly thorough study of German culture, science, art and philosophy and its influence on the West.Watson not only offers an exhaustive history of seemingly unlimited German cultural and scientific achievements (and a very interesting analysis on what he thinks caused them) but also makes a very convincing argument on how much Germany has influenced the (modern) world. Aside from that, it's a fascinating story of Bach, Kant, Marx, Goethe, Einstein, Gödel, Krupp, the Humboldt brothers, Lang, Feuchtwanger and so many others. Even though Watson doesn't shy away from the world wars and the holocaust (it's a crucial part of his work in fact) the title of the book is spot on. "

It, in a much more factual and researched manner than I could ever hope to encapsulate, confirmed my gut instincts and fuzzy ideas that I've held since I was introduced to Germans and German culture in the late 1990's.Educated, cultured (in the best meaning of the word), inward, conflicted, successful in the modern world but never comfortable in it… these are the Germans. While they often frustrate my American pragmatism and plebian beliefs, I still love them for who they are and what they give us."
19,0060760222,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1382279-austin,4,"If this history does not qualify as magisterial, I'm not sure what would. This is a valiant effort to re-instill a sense of national greatness among the German people based on their legitimate intellectual accomplishments over the past several centuries. I found this story to be very compelling. There truly has been something special about the way the Germans organized themselves academically to achieve such soaring accomplishments in every major field of intellectual endeavor. This dazzling quote from page 819 sums the significance of this book up for me: ""With the exception of market economics and natural selection, the contemporary world of ideas is one that, broadly speaking, was created by, in roughly chronological order, Immanual Kant, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, Karl Marx, Rudolf Clausius, Friedrich Nietzsche, Max Planck, Sigmund Freud, Albert Einstein, Max Weber, and two world wars. The ideas of another German, Gregor Mendel, are gaining ground fast at the start of the twenty-first century."" Worth reading for whomever wishes to understand modern intellectual history. "

It promised breadth, depth and tremendous amount of insight. However, I had to give up after about one third in. Basically, as you progress the book slowly looses a common narrative plot and becomes an encyclopaedic overview giving accurate but still fairly basic information about figures. There's very little to connect the episodes, and the snapshots themselves are pretty formulaic.I'm sure there is a common thread somewhere in there, but frankly, I can't be bothered to look for it. This is all terribly disappointing and I don't think it dos the service to the author. I feel we're being deprived from a real masterpiece by almost total lack of editorial control. In my opinion this should have either been pared down to a tight, well rounded book of 400 pages, or perhaps exploded across several tomes as an encyclopaedia of German thought."
21,0060760222,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20520130-jaap,4,"A very erudite and in-depth examination of the people from Germany that shaped the modern world, but who (due to the ravages of World War 2) have become mostly forgotten in the English-speaking world (and quite often in Germany itself too).The book is a great deal more academic than I would've expected from the big stacks that were for sale at the airport book stall. Not that I think that is a bad thing but I fear this may remain one of those Great Bought-but-Unread works. Which is a shame, because Mr Watson's analyses are well worth reading."

I find this a never-ending source of education and a resource to provide context for other reading."
23,0060760222,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1321130-aya,4,"Watson has a gift for producing vibrant, elucidated, quotes--from other people's arguments. About 1/10th of the way through his 900 page long volume (happily I'm reading this on my kindle...) I've already started to notice what may turn out to be this book's main flaw, rhetorical reliance on other authors. I'm not sure that this needs to be as much of a problem as it's feeling like. In theory there's nothing wrong with the book collecting and gathering a lot of research, it's a more histiography like argument anyway--but with a book this long the author's voice is going to have to hold the argument together, and I haven't seen evidence of that yet. This isn't really something I am holding against this book. There's a large difference between collections of unsourced quotations (Reality Hunger) and thoughtfully collected and sourced arguments. There's a wealth of information I hadn't heard before starting this book and the opening segments on Holocaust, wwii, european education and Germany was ""enlightening"" (har har har) and to someone like me (who gets a holocaust refresher course in every single German lit class I take!) the information made me actually want to talk about the holocaust and theory of german memory, something I haven't wanted to do since sophomore year of high school. "
24,0060760222,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1944947-barnaby-thieme,2,"Fundamentally, the question this book poses to the critical reader is, how much can you really expect to learn about Beethoven in a page and a half? That's what you get from Watson's breathless survey of a few centuries of pre-Nazi German culture - hundreds of very brief intellectual biographies, strung together with only the thinnest connective tissue. Perhaps useful as a reference, but for my taste, it's hardly worth slogging through one elliptical summary after another, usually with less depth than the corresponding Wikipedia article on the same subject. I would also warn the prospective reader that Watson shows himself to be completely out of his depth in dealing with German philosophy - his account of Kant, for example, is quite wrong, and obviously derived from a flawed understanding of secondary literature."
25,0060760222,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1231154-william-shep,4,"Britain’s Peter Watson is a former journalist who has written several provocative tomes on the history of ideas. His most recent work, The German Genius, is a massive survey of German history and culture from the Age of Bach to the present. His primary purpose is to address what he views as British and Americans ignorance regarding the enormous cultural impact that Germans have had on the world. He argues that British obsession with their heroic role in defeating Hitler, combined with the American idée fixe on the Holocaust, has blinded both countries to German accomplishments both before and after the Nazi era.Watson explores the concepts of ‘Bildung’ and ‘Sonderweg.’ The former, ‘Bildung,’ is a term with no equivalent in English and that is difficult to explain even in German. It signifies something akin to education combined with spiritual formation in not only achieving knowledge but also in learning values. The latter, ‘Sonderweg,’ describes the contentious theory (propounded especially by Daniel Goldhagen’s 1996 book Hitler’s Willing Executioners) that the Germans have made a unique historical journey from aristocracy to democracy, but on a path of abnormal cultural development, in comparison with western nations, which virtually ensured the rise of Hitler and the Third Reich.Watson, in effect, argues in favor of ‘Bildung’ and against the ‘Sonderweg’ by highlighting a long litany of German accomplishments in, among other things, music, philosophy, theology, science, medicine, and literature. He presents a series of mini biographies, (almost a biographical encyclopedia) of the notable Germans that created or drove these wide ranging endeavors. Among these luminaries are, to name just a few, physicist Heinrich Hertz, philosopher Immanuel Kant, composer Richard Strauss, writer Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, and historian Leopold von Ranke. Watson states that while America and Britain speak English both countries think German due to the immense and largely hidden impact of the German inspired higher education system that operates in both countries.This is an important book well worth the reading though the immense length of over 800 pages can be daunting. One comes away with the thought that one more edit might have made the same points while producing a slimmer, more palatable volume. This German-American reader also came away with the notion that despite Watson’s best efforts to discredit the ‘Sonderweg,’ he ironically reinforces it as any in depth exploration of German accomplishments (and they are immense) can not gloss over the underlying negativity of both thought and deed that so often burdens German culture and history."
26,0060760222,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29791454-domhnall,5,"Watson’s enormous book is bracketed by an introduction where he defines the problem he wants to solve and a concluding chapter setting out his findings. The vast quantity of material in between is not conducive to a rational judgement. I would have preferred a much more selective and economic presentation, in order to pin down just what is being claimed and establish if the evidence supports the arguments. The body of this book is filled with accounts of German culture from the end of the Thirty Years War to the end of the 20th Century. This is broadly defined to include theology and philosophy, history and archaeology, literature, music, the visual arts, science and technology, even aspects of economics and military science, as well as the institutions within which all these developments arose. It is easy enough to enjoy this compendium of so many great names, to have an explanation of their main contributions and to see a big picture in which they all relate each other in time, in place and in their ideas. That is, I think, the major attraction of all Watson’s big, heavy books. On the other hand, the accounts are so brief and sketchy that in most cases they are more helpful in placing different thinkers into a wider context than actually explaining their ideas in any useful detail. To be honest, when scrutinised, some of the descriptions seem pretty inadequate and unreliable. The more I know about the subject, the more likely I am to dislike Watson’s description and evaluation. He is most convincing where I know least, which to be fair gives him a lot of ground. If Watson was indeed merely reviewing German culture in modern history then I would have no difficulty enjoying the book for what it does best and moving on to my next reading challenge. However, the book presents itself as an argument with a very specific theme. Watson’s problem is that Germany is defined by the brief history of Nazism but that seems to him unsatisfactory and unfair. As a result, the entire book really has to be read in relation to this over-riding question: can German culture be separated from its Nazi experience?Watson accepts the claim that Germany was quite unlike its neighbours and that the achievements of individual Germans were made possible – even produced – by distinctive institutions in German life. He investigates what these were and runs through many examples of individual genius to justify the claim of German greatness. He notes that German nationalism and the move to German unity was at first a progressive force, emerging in opposition to the authoritarian regimes of the many petty German states. But as it happens, the 1848 revolutions failed across Germany, Germany was united in 1871 under the Prussian monarchy, and the cult of German nationalism was built on the destruction and eventual wreckage of everything that made Germany great. He points out repeatedly that Hitler’s rise to power resulted in the removal from German life of tens of thousands of excellent, sometimes exceptionally brilliant, scientists, artists, musicians and writers. Germany was a remarkable country in 1932 and the Nazis destroyed that achievement. The wreckage was not immediately obvious only because the removal of so many Jewish and other leading figures created openings and opportunities for compliant Germans to fill their places, some of whom were reasonably competent and even talented in their own right. Many such figures retained or recovered their positions after 1945. Only with the student movement of the late 1960s did West Germans demonstrate the will to engage positively with democratic politics, while for East Germans, the move away from autocratic government only began with the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. Watson’s definition of cultural history seems to exclude political history. I agree that it is reasonable to expect readers to know European history in outline and it is not where he wants to make his contribution. I don’t agree that cultural history can be apolitical or free of ideological commitment. Watson makes no such claim, naturally, but my interest is that his decisions shape the material that he excludes from his review as much as what he includes. Where he is obliged to include a few people on the Left, like Marx and Engels, they are given rather weak presentations. This defect becomes more clear when we notice that his definition of ‘German’ – in relation to German culture or German history or just defining who is German – is decidedly open to question. It does not suit him to discuss the contribution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire to German cultural history, but it does suit him to claim for German cultural history many achievements of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. The point about Germany which he does not ignore but somehow refuses to confront is that that before 1871, there was no Germany, and before the Anschluss Germany most certainly did not include Austria. As Gertrude Stein said about her birthplace, which was not in Germany but in Oaklands, California, “there is no there there.” This is not a trivial disagreement. German nationalism sought to embrace all German speaking people, while the Austro-Hungarian Empire sought to embrace a great diversity of people with various ethnic, religious and cultural affiliations. The two value systems are incompatible and it is shamefully dishonest to place all the achievements in the nationalist basket, long before the relevant nations came into being, while tipping into the imperial basket the evils [specifically, racism and communal violence] which broke out across all empires but were caused by nationalism. Nationalism excludes people who could belong under imperialism, and from Turkey to Finland, all across Europe, nationalism produced the forced migrations of millions of people during the 20th century, and the Germans had no monopoly of nationalist ideology. Nationalism and ethnic pride not only brings people together but also creates outsiders and excludes significant parts of the population who were previously included. That was never a specifically German phenomenon. In other words, the problem is not Germans, but nationalists. Generally, a focus on cultural history and not politics sometimes leaves the discussion hanging in mid-air. Indeed, it brings into focus the surprising reality that this seemingly comprehensive review is nevertheless selective both in its choices and its emphasis. Even though there is an awful lot of material in this book, the book quietly omits a lot more information that is essential if we are to seriously investigate the questions presented in the introduction. If the argument is a comparative one – that Germans were different to other Europeans – then it is not valid to rely exclusively on information about Germans. I don’t see anything uniquely or specifically German about racism, nationalism, authoritarianism, militarism or a compliant, supposedly apolitical middle class or bourgeoisie. I appreciate how important German influence has been for other cultures, but I would like more recognition of external influences shaping German culture, both negatively and positively. But the most useful comparison to my mind would be between German nationalism and the values of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and a key event, in my opinion, could be the date when the language of administration in the empire was switched from Latin to German. I can see no serious way for example to identify Wittgenstein or Freud as German. They were Austrian, products of a multi-cultural, multi-ethnic empire in which nationalism was anathema. I completely agree that we cannot allow the Nazi experience to blind us to the positive legacies of German cultural history. One step towards separating the one from the other must be to set aside the entire concept of German culture as our organising principle. I don’t accept that many of the German achievements in this book were German at all and I don’t find it helpful to label them that way. If the Nazis were the product of a uniquely German cultural history, then we can conveniently disregard the evidence of Nazi borrowings from the policies of the USA or Great Britain, from racism, eugenics and even genocide to techniques of totalitarianism based on persuasion, manipulation, militarism and fear. The Germans were treating Slavs and fellow Europeans, after all, in ways not unlike the vicious ways the British, French or Belgians treated Africans or the USA had treated native Americans and imported Black Africans. Every single one of the European nations has been able to behave in that way to the tune of the most beautiful music and the most touching poetry."
27,0060760222,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5422600-kristi-thielen,5,"At 856 pages, Peter Wat’s book isn’t for the casual reader. But it’s a solid, scholarly look at the German people, from the time of Frederick the Great to the modern day. It details the birth of “Germanness,” German culture and German nationhood; give ample information about the Germans of note in philosophy, art, music, history and, in later centuries, science and industry; makes a clear-cut case for how the German way of thinking fostered the concept of the university, the entire idea of research, literary form, study of Scripture and even modern film-making. It also tries to answer the chief question most people have: How? How could such a varied, strong-willed and highly accomplished people accept the hideousness perversity of Nazism? And accept it they did, as Wat makes clear: it is now painfully obvious that nearly every German knew about what was happening to the Jews. And the youngest generation of Germans not only accepts this, openly, but also accepts that the generation that allowed it to happened deserved their fate for doing so. Wat theorizes that the generation that confronted Hitler was handicapped by several significant factors. The first is a centuries-long German proclivity for “inwardness;” a withdrawing from the public sphere to engage in private intellectual pursuits. Philosophical study was a proper sphere for the intelligent German, not public service. Secondly, the political revolution of 1848 failed, and sent many Germans who dreamed of a vibrant, democratic German out of the country completely. Those who remained were too embittered to pursue politics again. The 19th century rise of science played a strange role in German society. In Great Britain and America, the sciences and the arts were seen as opposite sides of the same coin. In Germany, scientists and industrials leaped over those in the arts and humanities to become the second “tier” of society under the aristocracy. Those in the humanities were pushed downward and were resentful of their scientific peers. What could have stopped Hitler? A robust, educated middle class, accustomed to being a part of the political sphere. But Germany’s middle class was divided against itself, and had long left politics to “those other people.” The Nazis were “those other people” and gathered even more “others,” until it was too late for them to be stopped by anyone. Wat concedes that not everyone will accept his theories. But they can’t be ignored. "
28,0060760222,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33334584-peter-pinkney,5,"I am awestruck by this book, it is truly phenomenal.In his excellent introduction, Peter Watson points out that,when asked about Germany, most of us think of the twelve years that Germany was ruled by the Nazis, and forget about the rest of German history and all that the Germans have done for the world.This is a country that gave us so much in art, music, science, literature, philosophy and religion. The names of Bach, Beethoven, Mozart, Kant, Hegel, Goethe, Schiller, Mann, Casper David Friedrich, Marx, Freud, Hertz etc etc loom large. Starting with what Germany means, is it a nation joined by a common language? Or is it a shared culture? Watson endeavours to provide answers to this question, and in my opinion, succeeds as far as it is possible to determine that.Highly readable, although I found some of the maths and physics difficult to understand. Nevertheless that is my problem. The research, undertaken for this book, must have taken him years, and I want to thank him for it.I never knew that heroin was named after people who used it felling heroic, and I must admit that I had a wry smile when I learned that it was recommended as a cure for morphine addiction....A fascinating and very rewarding book. We must not forget the Nazis, but we must revere and remember all the good that Germany and its people have given to the world."
29,0060760222,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60343199,5,"This is a pretty informative encyclopedia on German culture and its unique place in the Western world from the 1750s onwards. Its basic message, aside from following on the cohorts of writers, artists, painters, composers, scientists and philosophers, is that people in the West are heavily influenced by originally German ideas, more so than one would expect.The three big topics that would make it the complete book on German culture, but are missing, are political context - barely mentioned, Germany's economic story, and the German technological legacy. Otherwise it's a wonderful read. "
30,0060760222,http://goodreads.com/user/show/222151-ed,4,Interesting and I learned a lot about the German intellectual tradition than I knew before but not as compelling as Watson's other two books covering the whole intellectual history of humanity since the invention of fire. Lots of German thinkers whose work I didn't know and also good on how powerful the influence of Germany has been on modern universities world wide. Well written and researched but somehow maybe the subject matter didn't appeal to me as much as I would have liked.
31,0060760222,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7389-scott,3,"Part of my fascination is language. All the profs say English is descendant of one kinda Deutsche or another; a word like Bildung comes along. It is not just a word: it is a concept, very important to understanding Germany. Which is important and really needs to use a lot of pp to tell you why. One word does not equal one word in another language. Several word/concepts like that. When you see italics, start paying attention.Watson's basic tenet is this: from 1750 -1933 it was the Germans. They transformed themselves, assembled a country, and dominated the cultural and academic worlds. Ask the average citizen to name 3 ‘classical’ composers: chances are they will mention at least 2 German musicians. Sociology. Psychology. Painters: who knew there were German artists?? My old Penguin pb copy of Also Sprach Zarathustra uses Friedrich’s ""Wanderer above a sea of fog"" on the cover. That is the sole piece of German art I can recall. Well xcpt Bierstadt, but he was American. They invented Expressionism… 849 pp, plus a list of “35 Underrated Germans”; goes quick in spots. Watson is thorough in his coverage of German culture ( and Kultur); of course, being Germans, there is a difference. I was looking forward to the post war sections, and was rewarded. We learn why 1968 was an important year for modern Germany. I enjoyed reading about science and chemical industries; copious notes with bibliographic citations can help one pursue topics. Dyes. IG Farben, which is Thomas Pynchon country. Rocket science, theoretical physics. How the Germans invented the seminar and research institutionalized by the universities with the development of the modern PhD. It is all in there. Dealing with WW2. Why Germans are such good recyclers.Each chapter is like another term paper: Watson uses tons of direct quotes, and not always in a supportive of his thesis role. He will occasionally use a quoted adjective; I found this irksome. It gets slow at the philosophy; Germans have been at work there too. Never knew of the philosophical link to the music, the notes, of Wagner, who frequently (along with his erstwhile pal Nietzsche) pops up. The section on German film was satisfactory for a book of this size. I never quite wanted to put it down. Watson has a conversational style; a plus over the long haul. One has to be interested in Germans, very much, or in intellectual/scientific history to read this. I am glad I did."
32,0060760222,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16279880-josh-brown,3,"This felt like two different books. Book 1 (basically the beginning and the end): a nuanced argument about the evolution of German intellectual history, its complicated relationship with Nazism and our inability to discern the complexity of that relationship because of our overwhelmingly Nazism-centered understanding of Germany and German history. Book 2: a long concatenation of 5-page overly simplistic summaries of every possibly important German intellectual, of every possible stripe, for the past 300 years or so. Book 1 would have been more interesting on its own; Book 2 had its own pleasures but ended up feeling more like high school history class than it should have.I'm not really in a position to prove that every one of the summaries is overly simplistic, but there are a handful of people whose work I *do* know a lot about (mostly philosophers or social theorists - Kant, Hegel, Marx, Weber, Nietzsche, etc.) and extrapolating from Watson's consideration of those thinkers' ideas, I feel confident in asserting that their thoughts' complexity is generally being flattened in the interest of the breadth of the study.If you remember a high school European history class in which you were told things like ""Hegel thought all ideas moved in a pattern from thesis, through antithesis towards synthesis"" (something Hegel never said, so far as I know) that memory will give you a general feeling for how this book will go. Each thinker's ideas are so minimally described in their complexity that you don't really learn anything about any of them individually, just about the overall flow of German intellectual history. To be fair, in some cases, they alerted me to people whose work I was not aware of, and like the ""Briefly Noted"" section in the New Yorker, might send me towards reading those books or listening to that music.What's strange to me is that Watson could have written a much shorter (therefore much more readable) book that still achieved the same ends. The over-simplified intellectual portraits do not, by and large, help to demonstrate the truth of the claims about the hovering cloud of Nazism and its effects on both Germans and other western non-Germans."

The reference itself contains 108 pages with a very tiny font. Unfortunately, you drown in all this and it's very hard to put out the head and do generalizations as well as attempt to accomadate the information.The book is in some sense encyclopedia about German scientist, artists, philosophers. I would prefer more analytical work (although I don't say the book contains none) and probably more cross-referencing since a name once mentioned rarely occurs again. When you read this book as encyclopedia (10-15 pages per day) memory just can't hold all those names. You left with the feeling that you've just finished an enormous work.

So he wrote this book to balance things out. Super (I am writing this in Germany and read this book traveling by train from Bonn to Hamburg; very entertaining reading from within). Of course, he shows how much the “stupidity” slowed down the “genius” sharing striking facts like “the Allies won the war because they had better German scientists than the Axis”. But this book starts somewhere in the eighteenth century building the chain of ideas behind the sciences and the arts. Much of today’s music, universities and sciences were shaped by the German geniuses. So you probably “think German” and this book explains why."

At times it does read like ""The Book of Lists"" by the Wallenchinsky/Wallace family. The book requires the patience of Job, to sift through the author's volume of evidence to support his hypothesis that without the tireless innovation of the German speaking cultures, the modern world as we know it would be less enlightened. However, Peter Watson's ability to call out connections between German achievements and our modern-day innovations, makes the book a very ""readable"" piece.

37,0060760222,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1261617-jeroen,4,"This book took me all the way from Nuremberg to my home in Leiden, the Netherlands, and then back to Marburg.I should explain, perhaps: I was on a bicycle tour through Germany, and - though some people swear against this - I like to read books about the places I go to. So I started this one. Actually, since I have it on my e-reader, I had no idea what kind of humongous tome I was getting myself into, didn't know about the thousand pages. It took me about an equal amount of kilometres on my bicycle to complete the thing.As I began I was immediately captivated by the introduction, which questions what had until a few years ago been a given in my life: the black stain that the World Wars left on Germany, a stain that has (somewhat) diminished in political and professional relations but hardly at all, it seems, in the general judgment of the so-called ""German national character"". This is summarized, basically, as Watson has it, by the English (especially) and many other countries (roughly) considering Nazi Germany as the great and obvious metaphor for evil in the world.This in itself is not that problematic. Most would agree. What complicated matters is the so-called ""Deutscher Sonderwegsthese"" - the idea that the development of Germany had always been fundamentally different from other European countries; the idea, too, that many (if not all) German intellectual efforts led to those twentieth-century horrors - most famously the work of artists such as Wagner, Nietzsche and Von Kleist.And if everything which led up to Nazi Germany was a part of the problem, this means everything that everything which led up to Nazi Germany needs to be removed as well. No more Goethe, no more Beethoven, no more Schopenhauer. It is this relentless wiping of history that Watson wants to rectify with this book.Watson casts a truly wide net, capturing the German spirit in all kinds of different fields, both artistic and scientific (and to a lesser extent, political). The book is structured as a kind of Who's Who of German (and German-speaking) history, small biographies which would read like Wikipedia entries if Wikipedia entries were written by people who can write (or were allowed to be written by people who can write).What lacks, to some extent, is an overarching narrative, such as is provided in the Introduction and Epilogue. Between those, there are some more general remarks here and there, but not enough to sustain the cover-to-cover reader for so many pages. As such, I would much more recommend this as a reference work than anything else.Here and there it might be too provocative for such a use, the writer's voice too present, but that (a provocative reference manual) might just be the thing you never knew you wanted."
38,0060760222,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10708119-pieter,4,"Germany is a country built on clichés: loud, hard working, bear drinking and sausage eating inhabitants, Hitler, Bierhosen und Laptops,… Its dark past and the post-war Anglo-Saxon hegemony (both economically and culturally) have shifted interest in Germany’s history away, apart maybe from its cars and classical music.Mr Peter Watson took up the challenge to list (almost) all important Germans and their achievements to mankind during the last 250 years. They were involved in culture, politics, science, philosophy, academics.Being driven by Bildung and that Pietist inwardness, a third Greek revival awoke Germany. Humboldt designed a modern type of university, Winckelmann founded a new type of archeology and Burckhardt enthused his readers about the Renaissance. The investment in academic careers paid off very soon. It is truly amazing to read about all the sectors in which Germans excelled: physics (Planck), biology (Mendel), philosophy (Kant, Hegel, Nietzsche,…), optics (Zeiss), machinery (Diesel, Benz), music (Wagner, Beethoven, Mozart, Brahms,…). Sometimes the book reads a bit like a encyclopedia (like Watson’s ‘Ideas’ and ‘A Terrible Beauty’). In that sense, it is better to use it as a guide to further reading on capita selecta. In comparison to Mr Frits Boterman’s ‘Cultuur als macht’ (Dutch book on the same topic), Watson deals only very little with German culture during the communist era.Many historians have discussed Germany’s Sonderweg and more importantly, whether Germany could revert to 20th century’s authoritarianism. Watson believes that this will be no longer the case. Watson noticed that the 1968 revolt was most popular in Germany. He sees this as a proof of its enhanced democratic strength. I disagree on this though. These revolt’s roots are (no wonder…) also German, i.e. Freudian Marxism. The Frankfurter Schule (Marcuse, Horkheimer, Adorno,…) created a totalitarian ideology that has fed 21th century media, culture and politics like none before. No wonder the German author Mr Götz Aly sees similarities between the ideology of the German youth in the 1930s and the 1960s with its antisemitism and anti-capitalism (see ‘Unser Kampf 1968’). Simultaneously, a communist country could cherish authoritarianism in the East for 50 more years and is still alive via Die Linke (see Mr Florian Henckel’s briljant movie ‘The lifes of others’). Most worrying is that these fractions use violence as a political mean, like in Hamburg and Berlin. I am afraid Germany is no democratic Walhalla yet."

Watson coined the phrase ""Third Renaissance"": the German spirit (deutscher Geist) generated indeed a view of life diametrically different of the moralistic Anglo-Saxon approach of human facts or the mechanical views introduced by the French Revolution. This Third Renaissance insisted on organic, naturel, life-based facts that cannot be analyzed by dry juridical or mechanical intellectual instruments but only by biological, variable, changing criteria. The book gives us a list of the cultural reflexes that have erased by the two European civil wars of the 20th century, that were also world wars precipitating the world into misery or submitted mankind to superficial ideological humbug, derived from moralistic or mechanical or juridical exaggerations.

I have to say that I found it difficult to put the book down. The book is very accessible and, if you are interested in cultural history, very interesting. I have come across many of the authors in The German Genius before but Watson brings the together in a very coherent narrative. He explain the origin of many of the debates about Germany, German history and German intellectuals by highlighting 'the genius' of the scholars, scientists, composers, philosophers, etc. that feature in the book. At times, as other reviewers have remarked he seems to loose the link to the German Genius and seems to just list people he thinks are relevant. But in hindsight I saw that the vastness of his enterprise is part of the argument that Watson tries to make. The output of German scholars over the past 300 years has been so great that as much as possible should be included in this one volume. Some might say that scholars elsewhere in the world have produced just as much scholarly, scientific, cultural, and artistic work as Germans. Why highlight the German Genius over others? Watson's motivation for the book however was to provide a way to see these German achievements despite the (recent) German history that overshadows people's view of Germany. Some might see this as controversial and a path that should not be treaded."

By the end (around 800 pages later) I was crying out 'wrong, wrong, wrong' at the page in frustration. I've spent nearly 11 months with this book, on and off, to get through its necessary length. And it is necessary, given how ambitious a project this is. I've travelled to Germany in between, and had some time to reflect on the arguments put forward in this huge piece of work (not scholarship, work). What I realised by the end was that too many bad editorial choices have been made in the name of the author's bias - towards the arts rather than the sciences - for it to win my general recommendation. The title - 'The German Genius' - is undeserved. I would suggest 'A Cultural Biography of Germany' instead. The name-dropping is astounding, and I assume the author built the first manuscript by means of an Excel spreadsheet or some other kind of database system with a list of 5000 famous Germans downloaded from Wikipedia. Thrilling stuff.The author would clearly prefer to be living in turn-of-the-century Berlin than London, and I can't fault him for that. It just comes across as an uncreative man trying so desperately to be cool. There are some really memorable insights here into the German experience, and it's such a shame that it was spoiled by so much Freud/Marx cheerleading, especially near the end of the book. And to answer the question posed near the end of the book, either of Britain or America (not to mention China or Japan) could claim eleven equally influential historical figures in their recent modern history - you just didn't write about that because it didn't fit your argument. But that's not even the point! Pseudo-philosophical arguments that try and 'prove' that one country is superior are just dumb.I rarely give a 2-star rating, but this just pissed me off enough to do it. One particularly clumsy section was when he started ranking Western European countries by brain size and IQ , without a hint of irony.

Wrong, wrong, wrong indeed.I'm really turned off of reading cultural history now, which is a shame. Not worth the time to read, unless you honestly think that Heidegger is the pinnacle of humanity's efforts in philosophical analysis.

49,0060760222,http://goodreads.com/user/show/84464320-jess,2,"There’s some fairly interesting historical writing here but it’s squeezed in between endless uninspired lists of people who did something important once. Some characters are introduced by way of fun anecdotes, the veracity of which is never explored. The links between topics even page to page are loose and not very well thought out. There’s definitely a sense that the author had already decided which ‘Geniuses’ would be mentioned in which chapter and any cross-contamination of topics is just ignored. For example, Kant features heavily in the earlier chapters about philosophy but by the time the topic of nationalism and racism appear in chapter 22 the conversation is more about the industrialists and historians, so the philosopher’s own influential racism is ignored. This periodisation problem persists throughout. The two main flaws are the unclear audience and the lack of a meta-historical framework. The idea expressed in the book (that the obsession with Nazism as a historical feature obscures centuries of brilliant German culture) is not nearly as radical as the author makes out. Sometimes it seems as though he’s trying to write to convince anyone who, novice to the field, thought to pick up a 900 page doorstop as light reading. Sometimes the all too brief discussion and explanation of some topics indicates he presumes an existing level of knowledge among readers. Serious readers will, in the end, be put off mostly because of the low quality of the history. Despite speaking of the German Geniuses he discusses as ‘lacking self-awareness of their own motives’, there is zero evidence of the author exploring his own relationship to history and literature. This means the book invariably falls into the trap of ‘pop history’, whereby a reasonably well-read surface level survey of people, events, and dates is presented as an apolitical research project. This ‘objective’ approach is emphasised by the author dancing around certain hot topics, for instance alternating between describing people as ‘products of their time’ on one page and ‘rabidly racist’ on another. Of course, in a nuanced view both of these standpoints are true! However, the author doesn’t add any nuance or explanation, as if his own analysis doesn’t need examining. This leads to some strange assumptions and statements based on nothing, presented with no attempt at analysis or justification, e.g. ‘Brahms was only sexually comfortable with prostitutes because he performed in brothels when he was young’ (indirect quote from p. 460). What? Kant’s racism gets a pass but a weird pseudo-psychological assessment of some guy’s possible sexual trauma is fine? TL:DR Yeah no this book does not slap. "
50,0060760222,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2068134-john,4,"I spent my Christmas break years ago making my way through Peter Watson's The Modern Mind, and then took up Ideas, his time-busting chronological survey of pretty much everything, before more recently studying his The Age of Atheists. All three books share with the German Genius a forgivable flaw. They stuff the pages full of names, dates, and knowledge. They cram immense learning into a relatively smaller space, if one that still nears a thousand pages in some of his chronicles. They can weary the reader, so short stints of a chapter or two are recommended. They strive to say everything. However, this ambition is forgivable, given the payoff that must be sought slowly, as the pages accumulate and his argument about why his fellow British, like so many other nations whose past is not untarnished when it comes to human rights and the assumption of peace and goodwill towards all, must come to terms with a nation that has confronted its past, dealt with it as best they could, being on both the long and short ends of the stick, so to speak, last century. Watson is fair. He acknowledges the gains and losses, and tallies the balance sheet adroitly. Like Simon Winder's Germania (which I reviewed right after this), he also challenges us to exhibit a more mature and informed view of today's German culture, and to stop peddling facile caricatures. Yes, in a diminished age of attention span, the effort required to follow this study pays off richly. He can seem like a dutiful encyclopedist at times, one darn thinker after another. But step back, consider his intro and conclusion, carefully reflect on his thesis, and the evidence he marshals for the fact that the turn away from the material and empirical towards the ideal and the individual, while maybe not the first qualities the uninformed (as was I) think of when judging the German quality of intellectual endeavor, account for both weakness in cohesion and strength in persistence."
51,0060760222,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70907778-liedzeit,4,"Watson thinks that the world, especially Britain, does not appreciate the German contribution to our world enough. Of course, everything is overshadowed by the twelve years of Nazism. And maybe, although this is not a theme Watson elaborates on, there is also some envy involved. Because the facts speak a clear language. The German share in arts (of course, especially music) and science is well above average. Watson describes the time from 1750 until the present, although it kind of fades out after 1933.We have a lot of small biographies, are reminded or even introduced to some of the forgotten geniuses (like Raffael Mengs). I like the fact that every area of culture is handled alike. It is clear that Watson feels more at home with philosophy then physics. But at least he tries. It can be irritating when a quack like Hahnemann is given the same space as Carl Friedrich Gauss, I certainly would not include Hahnemann among the Geniuses. But he is influential, of course. At times he is very vague and even plainly wrong (Wittgenstein and Cantor) but for a lot of purposes what we learn about the men (almost all men) is just enough. Pluralism is one root of the exceptional German position, Pietism another. The number of universities, or newspapers in Germany compared to England or France tells most of the story. Good book."
52,0060760222,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66738910-avarla,4,"This non-fiction book about German artists, scientists, and philosophers was highly interesting and very, very tightly packed with information. It spans the past ~250 years and includes but doesn't focus solely on the Third Reich and the developments during, to and fro it. Or at least it tries to, I often got the impression that Peter Watson tried to use another angle, but often slipped back into connecting the current chapter/person to the Hitler-Era in some way. But then there is probably no way around the abhorrent 12 years that left millions of people all around the world broken or dead.While Peter Watson repeatedly states that his book is not meant to find out why Germany in particular went to become the abhorrend dictatorship it was, there are still several occurrences of ""and the German Innerlichkeit (living inside of ones head a lot) probably played into the Third Reich's development a lot"" usually followed by sentences that felt like ""or not. Maybe. Possibly."" So it was a bit indecisive there. All in all also a good place to start if you want to learn about German thinking and culture."
53,0060760222,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2424006-mark,3,"Actually 3 1/2 stars (again).The scope of the material this book attempts to cover is amazing, so perhaps it's inevitable that, at times, it seems a little thin. I also thought the parts that covered literature, art, music, history, and politics worked better than the parts on mathematics and philosophy. There were also a remarkable number of misprints (or spelling mistakes), particularly late on in the book, as if Peter Watson were getting tired.That said, it makes a decent stab at trying to persuade its English-speaking audience that there is more to Germany than Hitler and World War 2. I've long been frustrated by the fact that so many people in Britain know only about those two things in relation to Germany, if they know even that.I'm not sure the attempt is entirely successful, not least because the parts of the book that deal with those subjects are easily the most absorbing. But Peter Watson deserves credit for trying."
54,0060760222,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70031849-glenn-christmas,4,"Thoroughly absorbing and makes a strong case for the intellectual contributions Germany has made to the world (key point: there's more, so much more, to Germany's intellectual history than Hitler).Watson does a good job of placing his subjects (scientists, philosophers, artists, etc) in a sufficient degree of context (i.e. what was the prevailing thinking in their field at the time, what *was* their field, if it even existed before they came along?). I did find that later in the book however, some of this contextualising gave way to a little too much name dropping (where subjects would be awarded perhaps a paragraph or two in total). As a reference book, this would not be a problem at all. However, as a casual reader, I found this detracted somewhat from the experience.Nonetheless, I can't find many other faults, this was a great read and I'm looking forward to picking up Watson's book on the history of ideas."
55,0060760222,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6665369-reid,5,"A long read but one that is packed with insightful information about the influence of German philosophy on the development of modern ways of thought, the role of German universities in establishing present-day emphases on research, and the significance of ""Bildung"". Of course, many more topics are covered in this ~300-year history, e.g. cultural events that occurred after WWII and the later reunification.  The roster of Germans covered in this book is much too long to post here, and it was expanded to include German-speaking areas of the time (modern-day Germany plus Austria, Switzerland, parts of the Czech Republic, and elsewhere) but some highlights include: Immanuel Kant, Mozart (Austrian), Alexander & Wilhelm Humboldt, Georg Hegel, Beethoven, Carl Gauss, Karl Marx, Rudolf Clausius, Gregor Mendel (Czech/Austro-Hungarian), Friedrich Nietzsche, Ludwig Boltzmann (Austrian), Max Planck, Albert Einstein, and Max Weber."

A lot of information about life, culture and science in German lands, starting from the XVIII century. Many German philosophers' views are presented clearly and succinctly. And a lot of interesting facts about the lives of philosophers, writers, scientists, etc. are given in an easily accessible manner. However, a strange feeling at the end. The author starts the book with the promise to dispell the widespread conviction that Hitler was somehow inevitable. In the end, he gives some explanation of why Hitler had to come to power. My opinions on what is possible and what is necessary, however, are still on the side of it being possible that history had gone otherwise. "
57,0060760222,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24235049-lukasz-lukomski,3,"It's not the easiest book to read. As mentioned by many previous reviewers, it reads a little more than a huge reference source, strung by thin connection (most of it is just being able to speak German fluently). It did have a few interesting stretches (over 849 pages of the main read), but I doubt they amass to more than 5% of the volume - there is a lot of philosophy and I don't think I'm adept enough to assess if the author gets it right. There is a bone to pick up with it though - by virtue of growing up in central Europe and spending most of my adult life in the UK I have a quite decent view from both angles and not every time 'Germans vs the west' is quite right - it's more 'Germans as central Europe representatives vs England'. "
58,0060760222,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71057-moses,4,"Watson's book is an excellent survey of German-speaking culture and thought from about 1700 to German reunification. I learned more about many famous German speakers (Einstein, Bismarck, Wittgenstein) and learned about people that I had never heard of, but who were immensely important (Herder, Ranke, Treitschke). The book is superb, but it is dense. It took me two months to read, and I think it could have spent a little longer in the drafting process. Additionally, it wasn't clear to the end that Watson's book is a survey. He does not make any overarching claims (beyond echoing Fritz Stern's assertion that the twentieth century ""could have been"" the German century), and although of course that it is not a flaw in itself, I feel that if he marshaled all this information, he could have drawn some pretty spectacular conclusions about the strengths and weaknesses of German culture. Instead, for better or for worse, he relies on earlier historians (Norbert Elias, Fritz Stern, Jurgen Habermas) to make those judgments. Four stars. "
59,0060760222,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6976149-joel-corney,4,"An incredibly wide-ranging survey of many worthy (and some not so worthy) German-speaking philosophers, artists, scientists, musicians, film-makers, explorers, academics and entrepreneurs from the last 250 years. Even with 950 pages, the breadth of the works comes at the cost of depth, although some attempt is made to weave some strands together in the opening and final chapters. Naturally, the horror of the Nazi years casts its shadow across the work, and one of the book's motivations is to explain how such a monumental political failure could occur in a nation with such a cultural and intellectual richness. "

All too often his books meander into potted biography and summary territory, but he makes an effort to identify, argue and pursue a thesis. The problem is that he often does not seem to know what his thesis is. Nevertheless, I would recommend this book to anyone who does not have much knowledge of the cultural and intellectual history of the German-speaking peoples from the 18th century to the present."

71,0060760222,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7054677-willis,4,"This is a big book that covers a lot of ground. It is not for everyone because it does cover a lot of history - from the Renaissance time period to the present day. The main premise is that the Germans have contributed much to our current way of life and thinking and that contribution has been lost in our preoccupation with Hitler, Nazism and the Holocaust. Its unfortunate that is what so many people think of when they think of Germany. But in reality, in the time period prior to World War II, the Germans produced a staggering amount of achievments in music, arts, science, mathematics, philosphy, etc. The author explains in a memorable quote ""The only reason why the Allies won WWII was because their German scientists were better than the German scientists"". This is true when you consider how many Germans were kicked out, a true drain of intellectual talent that the Axis powers could not overcome. I had no idea that the concept of a Phd originated in Germany and that the idea of scholarship as creating new knowdedge was a uniquely German idea. There's a lot to absorb with all the different individuals who are covered in detail, such as Kant, Hegel, Mozart, Beethoven, Freud, Gauss, Planck, Bohr, Heisenberg, Schiller and many others. After explaining many of these contributions, which impact our lives today, the author provides an explanation for how someone like Hitler could come to power and how the Holocaust could have happened, among an intellectually strong country. Some of my favorite obscure facts are that the diesel engine was invented by a German, Rudolf Diesel. And that the Mach speed that is measured for aircraft comes from another German, Ernst Mach. There's a lot of philosophical discussion that at times can be hard to follow, which is why I didn't give it 5 stars, but this was a fascinating book for me. I read most of it while on a trip to Germany which only made it even better. You should know that the author is British, so there is a distinct British angle to the book and their perspective on Germans. "
72,0060760222,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21979620-viktoria-michaelis,3,"The opening section of this massive book makes one fact clear before we get into the details of German Genius: the English-speaking world has little or no idea of the influence Germany has had on the world prior to the Second World War; history teaching in many schools is limited to a very small time frame; most people associate Germany only with the events of 1933 - 1945. There is, the author claims, a block placed on all other information, all other history surrounding the German Federal Republic and those who worked to make it one of the leading scientific, philosophical and literary leaders in the pre-war world.What follows is a long and detailed excursion into the many influences Germany has had, not just on the European world, but also on the American. Names of people in all walks of academic life, industry and commerce which are known or which should be known to those with an interest in the growth and expansion of learning within the country, growth which has moved outside the geographical borders of the country and has changed our way of thinking, of learning, over many centuries.Peter Watson does not play down the bad side of German influence, but enhances our understanding of many other instances of advancement, without which the world would be a much poorer, less educated place.There are one or two problems with the work: chronological inaccuracy which makes archeological discovery and influence an impossibility in one case; in-text cross references which do not lead to the referenced person but to the beginning of a chapter and a frustrating search for one small piece of information. This aside, the work is a marvel of research and factual information coupled with clear and concise opinion covering why and how the Germans influenced and changed our world for the better. Highly recommended for those who have been caught in the blindfolded history of the world wars, and for those who believe that all educational, scientific and medical advancement comes from elsewhere."
73,0060760222,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23282112-yanko-tsvetkov,5,"This book can be best described as narrative encyclopedia. The way it switches from subject to subject (music, philosophy, homeopathy, economics, quantum mechanics...) may trigger occasional mental hiccups, especially for readers who have an eye for detail and expect to retain a lot of information. But here the trick is to let go of the detail and instead enjoy the narration itself. The author begins by emphasizing the complexity of German culture contrasting it to the unfortunate habit of the Anglo-Saxon readers to pigeonhole it into the narrow confines of Nazi philosophy. The intellectual foundation of modern Germany is way richer and much more interesting than the lunatic ramblings of an Austrian painter who ended up usurping the coveted title of ""Führer"" with the help of people who were desperately trying to come to terms with their place in the world. Intellectuals, of course, especially modern ones, have a predisposition for complexity and pessimism. Viewed from their point of view, history is often defined by its horrors. This book manages to overcome this shallow habit and dedicate as much attention to positive side of German history. Say what you will about the past, modern ""Germany has moved on, with a vengeance,"" says the author. Whoever doesn't agree should probably consult a therapist."
74,0060760222,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5844931-toby,3,"Watson's Herculean book deserves praise just for his subject - the emergence of a remarkable talent of German intelligence that has helped to shape the modern world as it is today - from education to philosophy, from music to art, from logic and mathematics to all branches of science. In the anglophone world in particular, we have been somewhat blinded by the 12 year aberration of the Third Reich and then jealousy in the sixties at the Wirtschaftwunder.It's a huge area of civilisation that needs a satisfying overview, but ultimately ""The German Genius"" is frustrating because there is no tangible historical thread in his text to what becomes a dreary roll-call of the above talents. What kept me reading was fascination with the staggering number of individuals mentioned rather than being sucked into any hypothesis about how this happened. That probably requires several volumes in itself, but deep down it was difficult not to come away from this without feeling that an opportunity had been missed."

Essentially reads like an endless series of connected, chronologically and thematically linked wikipedia articles on German genius. I am also less than convinced with half of his thesis. I have no issue with the idea that Hitler has caused us to forget the achievements of German culture prior to the rise of Nazism. However, he seems to think that Hitler was not the logical consequence of German culture. While I would not submit that Hitlerism was inevitable, it certainly does seem as though it was a uniquely (at least in its widespread popular appeal and in its degree) of the developments in German thought, culture and nationalism in the preceding two centuries.

It was interesting to learn more about Von Humboldt, Carl Gauss, Hoelderlin, and Marx, but there were many subjects that only piqued my interest, which may be part of the point of this book: to realize that the Germans really had something going on in science and art. That said, Watson does give a fair amount of attention to the dark side of German thinking that led to the Third Reich. Would have liked to have learned more about the post-1945 German world, but this is a good survey of German culture and science, if you are interested in gaining a working knowledge for party tricks!
