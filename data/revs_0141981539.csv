0,0141981539,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1254616-nick,5,"If you're not familiar with Lovelace and Babbage, Sydney Padua's delight-filled webcomic, rejoice! It has now made the transition to print. You can pick up a doorstop of brilliant Victoriana-flavoured geeky humour, historically painstaking footnoting, and lovely art - and you should do so IMMEDIATELY. Let me just acknowledge right now that I'm not even trying to be objective: Sydney's comic always hit the sweet spot of my sense of how the world ought to be. Her riff on the (factually rather grim) story of Lovelace and Babbage and their not-quite creation of the computer in the 1800s is brain jazz. It's filled with digressions, anachronisms and sketch protrayals of famous Victorians, all riven through with an ebullient goofiness. This is history as I wish it was: bright, caring and full of zing. It's also the modern world through a Padua prism, with jokes about Twitter and Venn diagrams sprinkled into the dialogue. That said, there's also a truth here, as you can immediately see if you dip into Babbage's own writing: Sydney's portrayal of him as a Dickensian steam-age petrolhead with cranky uncle basenotes is spot on, and Lovelace - whose true historical upbringing was like something from a Warren Ellis comic about the Fascist precursors of the Superman concept - was every bit as quirky. There's something else going on, too, which is worth mentioning: this is a book about the creative process and the creative mind, with its fancies and magpie distractability, its excitements and sloughs of despond. I recognise the protagonists in myself and my friends and family, just as I do when I read Ray Bradbury's Zen in the Art of Writing or G H Hardy's remarkable A Mathematician's Apology. Creativity varies in its output according to any number of personality traits, but the process seems to be remarkably similar across disciplines: great artists, great activists, great poets, and great scientists share a veering perpendicular humour, and it's alive here, in this book.That's why I ran around like a four year old yesterday after Sydney dropped in my copy: because this book is full of life. Go. Get it."

Unfortunately, reading this work is not near as interesting as browsing through it. It consists of musings on what would have happened if Charles Babbage and Ada Lovelace had actually built Babbage's difference engine. Almost every page has footnotes, many of the footnotes have very long endnotes, and occasionally an endnote will have a footnote. It's not clear whether the footnotes serve the panels or the panels serve the footnotes. Taken on its own the ""graphic novel"" part is pretty thin, and it's very difficult to get a reading flow going with the constant interruptions. There are some interesting appendices with excerpts from primary sources and a description of how the difference engine was supposed to work.Also, don't expect to get detailed insight into the technical accomplishments of ether Babbage or Lovelace. The author (whom I hate to criticize because she seems incredibly likable and talented based on this work) seems in over her head when it comes to technical details.Despite my review, the popularity of this book on Goodreads may convince you to ignore me and read it anyway (I don't blame you). I see that this title is available on Kindle. Don't even think about it - you need a hard copy."
2,0141981539,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30800-oriana,5,"Typically I wait to review J&C books until after we have our book club meeting (if I remember to actually review them at all), but I've just this moment finished Lovelace & Babbage, and it was so utterly splendid that I had to write about it immediately. I was pretty stoked about this one going in (I wrote an article about Ada on Atlas Obscura for Lovelace Day last year), but still I was completely blown away. This book is so charming, so monstrously intelligent, and so, so incredibly much fun. Sydney Padua is brilliant: a brilliant scholar, a brilliant researcher, a brilliant putter-together of seriously complex mini-plots, and just a brilliant entertainer overall. Here's a quick note on the book's (brilliant) structure: Victorian mathematician Ada Lovelace is most famous for having taken a short French paper about one of inventor Charles Babbage's (very complex) lectures and then translated and annotated it, her notes amounting to about 2-1/2 times the length of the original paper. Padua has written this book in the same way, with each comics page footed by an inch or several of notes, as well as extensive endnotes at the back of each vignette. All the extraneous material allows Padua to demonstrate the dazzling breadth of research she has done, from descriptions of each historical figure in endless articles and books and private correspondences, down to all these great askance mentions in obscure journals, even including a recipe for Ada's favorite toothpaste. (!!!)Padua opens the book with thumbnail histories of Ada (""It's not easy being the daughter of Lord Byron, a celebrity mad genius deviant sex god, and Ada was monitored by the entire country, it sometimes seemed, for signs of madness, genius, and deviant sex. She would gratify expectations of all of the above."") and Charles (""Babbage's long, illustrious, and varied career was characterized by both innovative genius and constant drama and strangely petty quarrels."") Then she moves into the parameters of the pocket universe in which the rest of the book will take place—one wherein Ada did not die young and Charles did build his Difference Engine, which would have been the very first computer had it ever made it off the page and into reality. And then we're off on adventures! Padua packs each one to the absolute hilt with 19th-century arcana, quotes from Ada and Charles' myriad written works, intricate tracings of how everyone in Victorian England knew one another, and cameos from a whole bunch of actual historical figures, including Samuel Taylor Coleridge (whose attempt at poetry Ada foils), George Eliot (whom Charles must save from the Curse of the Typos), and Queen Victoria (whose favor Ada secures via binary pictures of cats—LOL). The final and longest vignette recasts Ada as Alice lost in a mathematical poetical Wonderland, wherein Lewis Carroll's mathematical proclivities are brought to bear and the footnotes themselves emerge as a central character. There's also a larger-than-life cigar-chomping steam engineer, an attack on the Engine by Luddites, digressions on Euclidian geometry, and an appendix full of source material, including a triumphantly discovered letter exonerating Ada's (highly contested) genius whose footnote reads, in part, ""this was my introduction to the very great thrill of throw-down victory in Combat Scholarship.""Holy good god every bit of this is so stunningly wonderful. I can't believe how much I adored it! It's easily in my top 5 graphic novels evaaar. "

4,0141981539,http://goodreads.com/user/show/270740-meagan,5,"Most important thing first: Where can one acquire action figures of these versions of Lovelace and Babbage? Because I need them. My life is not whole without them. I am 100% serious about this. Someone get on it.Now to details. This weird little book is delightful. It takes the already fascinating story about the friendship of two mathematicians developing the idea for the first computer, and then ramps it up. What would the world have been like if Babbage had actually seen this through and built his difference engine, rather than scrapping it unfinished in favor of the analytical engine, which he also never finished due to never ending improvements and tinkering with the design? Also assuming that Ada Lovelace hadn't died so young of cancer, of course. According to Sydney Padua, the world would have been awesome. It would have been Victorian Steampunk, fully realized. (And this is not so difficult to believe, really. Imagine - the Victorians with steam-powered computers built of brass cogs. The mind boggles.) Also imagine that Lovelace and Babbage teamed up to use the difference engine in the fight against the world's greatest evils - poetry and street music.I find it difficult to express how much I enjoyed reading this. From the way Lovelace and Babbage are drawn, to the appearances of George Eliot, (the epically named) Isambard Kingdom Brunel, Charles Dickens, and Queen Victoria herself. The humor was spot on. The author did her research, points out where her version differs from reality, and shares her sources. I want more. So, so much more. I want Saturday morning cartoons. Halloween costumes. Movies. And action figures. Seriously, guys. Who's making that happen?"
5,0141981539,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,4,"This seemed like a comic perhaps more for my partner than me (and lo, she did love it), but I wanted to give it a try too after hearing some stuff about it on the radio… somewhere. And Robert kindly sent me his copy to peruse, so I had no excuse (and didn’t really want to find one anyway). I like the art — it’s cute, but not too cute; lively and character-ful, without feeling like caricature. And the sense of humour suits mine pretty well too.If you’re looking for a serious what-if about the Difference Engine, then this isn’t really your show; the comic itself is more about the characters, their endearing characteristics, their partnership. It’s based heavily on material surviving from the correspondence of and commentary on Lovelace and Babbage, but the events themselves are fanciful, often ludicrous, for the sake of a fun rather than “educational” comic. It works well, if that’s what you’re here for — and even if you aren’t, there’s a whole wealth of info contained in the footnotes and the appendices.One thing I did find awkward about reading this was how busy the pages are. Text! Everywhere! Here’s a footnote there’s a footnote and another little footnote! My brain is not very good visually at all, so I found it cluttered and distracting at times. Colour might have helped; maybe not.Still, overall fun and yes please to Ada Lovelace as hero.Originally posted here."
6,0141981539,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4095840-megan-hornberger,2,"I love how self-aware this graphic novel is. It pokes fun at itself, it makes mention of technologies that the reader will know to ease them into the world of Ada and Charles, it calls servants ""minions"" to add just the right amount of comedic relief, but it lacks fluidity. There is an overwhelming amount of footnotes, endnotes, technical explanations, passages from letter exchanges, etc. It becomes visually distracting and often does nothing to add to the graphic portion of the novel. I think that it's almost meant to be the other way round, where the graphic portion is only there to support the footnotes/endnotes. I admire the art, but overall I can't say I think this was a successful graphic novel. It's just too busy."
7,0141981539,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7761071-adan,5,"One of the best comics on computing and mathematics I have ever read, even if it mostly took place in a pocket universe. If mathematics can have imaginary numbers that are incredibly important for certain types of equations, then literature can definitely have imaginary histories that are incredibly important to our understanding of the world."
8,0141981539,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10407443-ross-blocher,5,"The Thrilling Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage is beautifully drawn and a wellspring of geeky, Victorian fun. Sydney Padua is an animator and visual effects artist who started a comic series to work out her obsessions with Ada Lovelace (widely credited as the first computer programmer) and Charles Babbage (widely credited as the designer of the first computer). Padua assembles the little we know about these historical figures and lays it out in illustrated/annotated form: Lovelace was the daughter of famous poet Lord Byron. She had an immense aptitude for math, and perhaps a bit of a temper. Babbage was brilliant and self-obsessed, but never actually constructed his difference engine, let alone his grander design for an analytical engine, despite funding from the crown. Lovelace and Babbage knew each other and collaborated: Lovelace contributed to the software side of what Babbage sought to establish with calculating hardware.Having reached the somewhat disappointing conclusion of the bare facts, Padua transports us into her Pocket Universe, an expanded alternate reality in which the analytical engine was not only built, but used by Lovelace and Babbage to solve crime, rejigger an economy, and parse written language. In this counterfactual space, Victorian figures both known and unknown to the real Lovelace and Babbage (Mostly known! It is fascinating to hear about interactions with the likes of Queen Victoria, Charles Darwin, and Charles Dodgson, aka Lewis Carroll) play roles, and Padua synthesizes fun observations and snippets of research (much of it original) into a coherent narrative. She does so with elaborate and wide-ranging footnotes that provide equal parts geeky fun and tedium, depending on how interested you are in the topic at hand. Padua has fun with this, often at the expense of her own fixations. In some cases, the characters themselves intervene to block footnotes or blast them off the page. It's smart, it's playful, it's irreverent, and it's educational in the I'm-not-so-sure-I'm-ever-actually-going-to-use-this-but-my-goodness-it's-fun sense. It may not be for everyone, but it certainly is for me, and I benefited from many of the connections and references.And the illustrations! Padua has a loose, confident style that bespeaks skilled observation. She draws with a thick-and-thin line and a sense of caricature that recalls Bill Waterson's Calvin & Hobbes, but is suffused with rough hatching to evoke the engravings of the era (which are often worked into the illustrations). It's all very steam punk, which is appropriate: it's hard to get more steampunk in real life than Babbage's designs for the difference engine and analytical engine, with their towering columns of spinning cogs and number-carrying arms (a version of Babbage's difference engine was constructed in the early 21st century: you can see some of the amazing footage here). Much of the humor is conveyed through very subtle expressions and postures, and I spent a lot of time just staring at the drawings. At times you can tell that Padua was working quickly or roughly, but she is good at suggesting detail where real detail has not been rendered.While Padua is careful to state areas of ignorance and qualify examples of incomplete knowledge, there is so much good, interesting, well-researched and well-explained information here that I can't help but think of it as a scholarly work, even as we engage in caricature, wordplay, whimsy and parody. Highly recommended to all of my fun-loving nerdy friends."
9,0141981539,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5172893-sesana,4,"This is one of the most ridiculously well researched comics I have ever read. Given the subject matter, it's hardly surprising that both history and math play a large part in the weird and somewhat silly imaginary adventures of nineteenth century math geeks. I expected that, but the sheer depth of research information is somewhat overwhelming. And by that, I mainly mean all the mathematics, because math is absolutely impossible for me to understand. Still, I greatly respect the sheer level of detail all that research has lead to. And you can actually read the book entirely without going through all the math footnotes, because those weird and silly adventures are actually fun to read. "

WICKED!!!""But, be prepared for some wildness from Ms. Padua! Imagine a sweet/sad/fun thesis in history and computer science told in graphic novel format about the inventors of a factory-sized steampunk calculating machine and several famous Victorian authors and scientists.Now stop imagining, go to the library, and read this book."
11,0141981539,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8575414-emma,2,"Way too many footnotes. I’ve been wanting to read this for a long time. The premise is really cool but unfortunately for me, it didn’t really deliver."
12,0141981539,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1325473-jimmy,4,"A graphic geek-out full of historical nuggets and arcana. You'll be lost in these pages for months (at least I was) reading footnotes, not remembering or even caring what they're footnotes of, learning tidbits of useless knowledge, giggling at obscure nerd jokes or visual puns. But in the process you'll also get to know Babbage, Ada, and Sydney, three personalities that really shine through here. Through the eyes of Sydney Padua, we get to know these historical figures not simply from their accomplishments, but from what they COULD have done as well, in alternate parallel universes. Sydney's enthusiasm for these characters infects every page from a mind-boggling amount of research to lovingly drawn expressions. This isn't a stuffy history, it's exactly what history should be: fun, creative, exciting, and getting to know REAL people, facts be damned (I say that but everything here is BASED on fact, it's that she also riffs off of them and is not afraid to go down crazy conjectures that makes this book so unique and personal and not at all a boring history)."
13,0141981539,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1072582-kaethe-douglas,5,"So, on the one hand you have accurate historical background on Babbage and Lovelace and the work they did together.And then there are the fantastical steampunk adventures they might have had if only they'd gotten around to making the first computer. The adventures are as heavily footnoted as the real history, so one can learn a great deal about the historical figures, the process of digging through history for evidence, and more. Great fun for all ages, although the really young would need an advanced reader to help."

15,0141981539,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34550725-alfred-haplo,4,"When imagination meets reality, thrilling adventures happen. Two brilliant minds, with personalities larger than life and 24 years of age apart, met one fateful day on June 5th, 1833. The rest, as they say, is history. (And copiously footnoted) *.   Ada Lovelace and Charles Babbage were way ahead of their times in Victorian London. He was a wealthy inventor and the Cambridge Lucasian Professor of Mathematics, hailed in modern era as “father of the computer” having invented the pre-pre-pre-precursor to modern computers called the Difference Machine. In 1837, Babbage embarked on an vastly more ambitious project to build the Analytical Machine. A metal monstrosity, it can calculate long strings of numbers (up to 15 decimal places of pi). A tiny section of the Analytical Machine looks like this:  … But it was probably meant to look like this:   Babbage’s notoriety was well-known within the elite intellectual circle of Victorian Who’s Who. He wrote prolifically in diverse scientific pursuits, threw lavish parties, hung with literary heavyweights, has a personal vendetta against street music among many idiosyncrasies, and was forcefully opinionated. In short, Babbage was obnoxious and eccentric but was tolerated with amusement because he was A Brilliant Scientist. However, while Babbage was a numbers and technical whiz, being all about nuts and bolts, levers and cranks, formulae and ratios, he lacked creative vision. Entered Augusta Ada King-Noel, Countess Lovelace, with her incredible leaps of the imagination. At a young age, Lovelace was steered into a rigid mathematics path by a mother determined to squash the poetic impulses that drove her father, the famous and infamous poet, Lord Byron, to madness.   Lovelace pursued science fervently, and implored her mother to ‘Pray find out all you can for me, about everything curious, mysterious, marvellous, electrical, etc., etc.” In her collaboration with Babbage, she wrote the first published algorithm for the Analytical Machine, by exploring its utility far beyond number-crunching to more abstract manipulation of music and symbols. Lovelace was on to a very futuristic concept, and for this, she is known as a visionary of the computer age. An excerpt from Lovelace’s, ‘Notes upon L. F. Menabrea’s “Sketch of the Analytical Engine Invented by Charles Babbage”  ‘Supposing, for instance, that the fundamental relations of pitched sounds in the science of harmony and of musical composition were susceptible of such expression and adaptations, the engine might compose elaborate and scientific pieces of music of any degree of complexity or extent.’ Lovelace’s inherent “madness” - suspected bipolar disorder, a genetic trait through her father - manifested despite attempts to suppress it. Prone to illness, she succumbed to ovarian cancer at age 39 years, just 11 years after her first encounter with Babbage, who remained a loving friend till his own death as a cranky curmudgeon at age 79. Her calling card, inscribed with her cursive handwriting the word “Interesting”, was found in his deathbed possession. The Analytical Machine was never completed, but its inventor and its ""high priestess"" are remembered.   [* Footnotes1. The real story is thoroughly researched and generously illustrated by Sydney Padua in The Thrilling Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage: The Mostly (True) Story of the First Computer2. Shoddy review not worthy of the book, er, comic, book with comic? Graphics novel? No, comics in a book. Whatever. It’s fun. 3. Besides the real history, Padua gleefully re-imagined alternate what-if stories of the duo in a pocket multiverse. They are all funny, except the real one. Well, the real one is funnily portrayed, but people died and the machine wasn’t built. So, it’s funny, but not too funny. More like a quirk at the corner of your smile.4. Queen Victoria made an appearance. On a horse. 5. The real stars, Lovelace and Babbage, outshine their caricatures. Padua’s lighthearted interpretations and comedic superimposition added playfulness, but it felt a little short in capturing the emotional depths of this pair. Yes, yes, comics as a medium is usually two-dimensional but maybe I hoped for less slapstick.6. Many footnotes annotate the illustrations. Excessively many footnotes. Sometimes they run into pages. And pages. All good stuff though, they flesh out the pictures.7. Only 7 footnotes in my review.  ….. 8. Ok, I lied. Recommended for geeks and non-geeks alike who actually have a bit in common. We all can't live without our computers, can we?]"
16,0141981539,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2492588-katie,4,"This is one of the most charming things I've ever come across: a sweet, fun graphic novel that explores the lives of Charles Babbage and Ada Lovelace, often credited with being the creators of the first proto-computer in the 1840s. Sydney Padua skirts around the fact that both of their stories had relatively sad endings - Ada died young, Charles old and bitter - by spinning them off into their own pocket universe, where their Analytical Engine was actually built and used by the pair to go on thrilling adventures together. Like I said: super charming. Sydney Padua essentially lets her characters speak for themselves, which is essentially the best and worst part of this graphic novel. It's be best, because Charles Babbage and Ada Lovelace are SUPER interesting on their own, and because Padua does a great job presenting the info in a lively and witty manner. This book is spilling over with fun historical anecdotes, to the extent that once every 5-6 pages I'd feel the need to write some of them down, or run off and share it with a friend. Babbage and Lovelace are A+ protagonists: Lovelace is the daughter of the infamous Lord Byron, trained from a young age to stay as far away from the unspeakable dangers of poetry and pushed into the more sober realm of mathematics (it didn't work, of course - her math quickly became theoretical, abstract, and poetic). She was also an expert horsewoman, a trait passed on to her daughter, whose travels through Arabia resulted in the arrival in Europe of 90% of modern Arabian horses found on the continent. One gets the impression that she was brilliant and imaginative (if, in the real universe, somewhat unhappy). I sort of want to be her now. Babbage was clearly a firebrand, a brilliant, emotional man who unfortunately was far better at planning projects than ever seeing them through. He threw lavish parties, was popular and gregarious but also moody and ready to spew forth a lengthy denunciation of his enemies. His Difference Engine was a behemoth of a calculating machine, a whir of gears and columns and pinions designed to mechanically compute vast numbers of sums. He was funded by the government, which was understandably less than pleased when he got bored of it and moved onto the more ambitious Analytical Engine, capable of carrying out programs beyond simple arithmetic. Babbage was genuinely furious and perplexed that the government, despite his failure to finish his project, did not fall over itself to give him more money. He also, later in life, became most famous in Victorian London for his impassioned campaign against street musicians. Sydney Padua does not waste this golden opportunity, and this graphic novel is a total delight to read. It would be worth it solely for the wonderful array of historical anecdotes to be found in the footnotes, and the lively & imaginative style that's present throughout. I do wish that the story itself was a little bit more ambitious, though. Rather than have a full, overarching narrative, Lovelace and Babbage go on several mini adventures, largely designed to have them interact with other characters of the period, like George Eliot or the inimitable Isambard Kingdom Brunel. It's fun, but I would have loved to see these characters take on a more ambitious narrative arc in their pocket universe. Maybe next time? I'll save the 5 stars for that hypothetical thrilling adventure. "
17,0141981539,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29806153-high-plains-library-district,5,"Allow me to take a moment to review a book that could be considered a bit strange to a general audience. Let me see if I can describe what kind of book it is.It’s a graphic novel based on historical people and events. Kind of. Charles Babbage, an inventor, and Ada Lovelace, a mathematician (and the daughter of poet Lord Byron), are widely credited with the idea for the first computer. They called it the Analytical Engine and it was never built, but the early ideas of computer science are there. This is kind of their story, but you’ll also see other famous Victorians, like George Eliot, Charles Dickens, Isambard Kingdom Brunel (is that a great name or what?), and Queen Victoria herself.It’s also about science and technology. Sydney Padua did a lot of research about Lovelace and Babbage and about their work on the Difference Engine and the Analytical Engine. She takes the time to explain the ideas behind these Victorian computers, and goes over the plans for the machines and how they would work. There are cartoon diagrams! If you’re interested in science and engineering from the Industrial Age, you’ll definitely find it here.It’s also, and this is my favorite part, a fictional account of what the world might have been like if Lovelace hadn’t died young of cancer, and if the duo had actually built their Analytical Engine. (Which is called by its calculator-like predecessor’s name, the Difference Engine. Because let’s be honest. Difference Engine sounds much cooler.) What that ends up looking like is an epic mashup of science and steampunk aesthetic. It’s a steampunk adventure starring scientists. The Difference Engine takes up an entire massive building (and is constantly growing), and a pipe-smoking Ada Lovelace and be-goggled Charles Babbage climb through the works to keep it in operation. There are runaway steam engines. There’s a wild herd of cats living in the machine. It’s the nerdiest fun I’ve had in ages.The final thing I want to say, and I’ve said it before, is that I want Sydney Padua to license her Lovelace and Babbage as action figures. Because having Lovelace and Babbage action figures would make my life as a nerd complete. Be honest. Who wouldn't want these two living on a shelf somewhere? No one, that's who.Here are some other books that might appeal to the nerd in all of us:There’s less narrative in Hark! A Vagrant than in The Thrilling Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage, but there is plenty of history and humor. If you like jokes about Napoleon and Shakespeare and the Brontës made in comic strip format, this is your book.For more of the sciencey steampunk stuff, try Clockwork Game: The Illustrious Career of A Chess-Playing Automaton. It tells the story of a chess-playing automaton – and Charles Babbage actually challenged it. History!Or, if you want to cut out all the fun and just have the straight science, you can learn more about the real Lovelace and Babbage in Architects of the Information Age.-Meagan"
18,0141981539,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5916992-albert,4,"The Thrilling Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage: The (Mostly) True Story of the First Computer by Sydney Padua is an irreverent and quirky view of what could have been the most outstanding scientific collaboration that didn't happen. Padua tells her tale in a graphic comic format with artwork reminiscent of early turn of the century (the 1900s) political cartoons. Its fun! Its awesome! Its over indulgent cheesecake for the geek universe!Charles Babbage is Victorian London's unrecognized inventor of what would become the modern day computer with his plans for a monstrous mechanical calculating machine. Ada Lovelace is the Countess of Lovelace and daughter of the mad and brilliant poet, Lord Byron. Ada Lovelace translates a description of Babbage's calculating machine with annotations that were three times longer than the original plans. These footnotes from Lovelace actually contain the first known general computing theory, a century before the first actual computer was built! Unfortunately Lovelace passed away before her paper was ever published and Babbage never built his brilliant machine. Sydney Padua creates an alternate reality where Lovelace and Babbage create their awesome calculating machine. A behemoth that grows and grows in steam powered engines, and gears, and analytics, and doo dads and just freakin' awesome stuff. They will open up and explore the wild and untamed dimensions of mathematics! They will create economic models to stave off depressions! The will battle the demons of spelling errors! And for the Queen herself, create dot matrix kittens!Tongue in cheek perhaps, totally geeky surely, but fun all the same. Original. Thought provoking. Full of ""what if"" and untapped potential. In Babbage, the blustering scientist whose uncompromising and attitude make him a social pariah, Padua has developed a character whose brilliance makes him an outsider to a society he frowns upon but needs to continue his work. In Lovelace, the pre-feminist in Victorian society whose love of mathematics is only rivaled by her fear and disdain for poetry and the arts. Poetry which is in too many ways her opium, her drug, her weakness as she abhors the immoral ways of her father. Together they could have accomplished the unthinkable and in The Thrilling Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage, they do. Granted by happenstance at times but isn't half the fun?A terrific read!"

Although it certainly feels novel, I’m not totally certain that it IS a novel, if you catch my drift.And if you like the kind of book where authors include lots of asides that induce laughter and add information while being both tongue-in-cheek and also true, you will love this book.It purports to be a graphic novel that started as a webcomic about the fictional adventures of an alternate Charles Babbage and Ada Lovelace, where they actually managed to build Babbage’s famous Analytical Machine and Lovelace wrote programs for it that were able to be input, instead of the real world where Babbage started lots of inventions but never finished them, and Lovelace died of cancer in her mid-30s, after having written a seminal article on computer programming that she never got to see put into use.This fictional world is much more fun. But in detailing the fictional adventures of our intrepid hero and heroine, the author manages to insert an incredible amount of real information, often in the form of footnotes and asides, that is taken verbatim from contemporary accounts of Lovelace and Babbage.And there are LOTS of surviving documents. The Victorians were very prolific (or profligate) writers, and Babbage and Lovelace were both quasi-celebrities. Lovelace was the daughter of Lord Byron, and Babbage, was, well, Babbage. He held a mathematics professorship at Cambridge that had been formerly held by Isaac Newton. Babbage was also infamous for misplacing government grant money, including a large grant for his Difference Engine. Babbage held large, well-attended parties, and famously argued with lots of people, many of them influential, about lots of things. In public and in writing.Both Lovelace and Babbage were well-known mathematics geniuses, and they were good friends. The exact nature of that friendship is subject to debate, but they wrote to each other voluminously.In other words, the author of this book had oodles of material to work with.While the story that emerges in the webcomic is definitely fictional, the underpinning facts are relayed in a way that makes readers laugh out loud, and provides a surprising amount of understanding about two figures who did so much to create the computer revolution that we now live in – even though they hadn’t a clue at the time.Escape/Reality Rating A-: I am still not sure whether to call this fiction or nonfiction, hence the combination rating for both escapism and reality.The depiction of Babbage and Lovelace as somewhat mad inventors whose invention has definitely gotten out of hand is hilariously funny. Seeing them both as quintessential steampunk engineers, while not factually correct, rings surprisingly true. This is an alternate future that would have been so much fun!At the same time, that these two figures have become posthumously associated with a movement as full of beautiful design and style as steampunk is its own kind of funny. In real life, neither of them was exactly known for their sartorial elegance. Or even their sartorial tidyness.The individual stories are both funny and have that sense of feeling true without actually having been true. The chapter where George Eliot submits her manuscript to the Difference Engine for analysis has a lot of true things to say about Victorian writers in general, George Eliot in particular, and the nature of computers and computing capabilities, all in one swell foop. And I do mean swell foop – this is all fiction but it all still feels true.Ironically, I also feel like I learned more about the real Ada Lovelace from this fictionalized, cartoonish version of her life and works than I did from a less fictionalized, and also less fun, biography, Ada's Algorithm: How Lord Byron's Daughter Ada Lovelace Launched the Digital Age. That felt like gossip for the sake of gossip, where in Thrilling Adventures every seemingly silly aside is both grounded in fact and makes a point about its subject.The Thrilling Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage is a terrific, and terrifically funny book for anyone who wants to learn a little about the birth of computing and the outsize personalities of the Victorian era, while having a good chuckle."
22,0141981539,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2056700-vishal-katariya,4,"I loved the concept! This is a fun and rollicking thing to read. The footnotes quite literally have a life of their own, and IMO are the best part of the book. Part research thesis, part flight of fancy -- say no more, you have me hooked. I feel like a significant amount more could've been done with the plot, but it's easy for me to say that. The way the characters were brought out, the satire of almost everyone involved, it's so fun and laugh-inducing. Reading books like this reminds me why I enjoy graphic novels, and more generally, why graphic novels are sometimes much more enjoyable than normal books."
23,0141981539,http://goodreads.com/user/show/724491-paige,2,"There were some things I really liked about this book but on the whole I'm not sure how well it worked for me. First, Padua has done her research and it shows. My favorite part of the books were the footnotes, which were fun, informative, and thorough. The information wasn't just about Lovelace and Babbage but about the Victorian era, other personalities, math, the history of math. They were really fun to read and I think I would have liked a book composed entirely of her footnotes and endnotes. I liked her art too, though. It was expressive, cute, and creative.What I didn't like about this book was the ""graphic novel"" part. Basically the comic/story that came after page 28. There are about 16 pages of ""nonfiction"" biography about Charles Babbage and Ada Lovelace. But Lovelace died young and Babbage never made his computing engines. So Padua decided it would be more exciting to imagine an alternate universe where they were able to build the machine and come up with ""adventures"" for them to have. The problem for me was that I did not like this alternate universe. The adventures were boring or confusing. After a while I stopped even trying to read the comic and just read the footnotes and the endnotes, which made up the vast majority of the words in the book and stayed nonfiction even as the story veered into strange and unappealing territory--what if Queen Victoria visited? what if George Eliot dropped by to have her book analyzed and then got lost inside the engine? what if the Duke of Wellington made them use the machine to help the economy? These imaginary scenarios held no interest for me, did not seem well plotted, and were pretty tedious. It's really unfortunate because I thoroughly enjoyed those 16 pages I mentioned earlier about the actual Lovelace and Babbage, and I continued to enjoy the footnotes throughout. They were much more interesting than the story.Padua obviously put a lot of work into this book. I admire her scholarship. The information she presented about Victorian personalities and history, math, and the history of math and computing were especially fascinating, and the biographical details of Babbage and Lovelace were amusing. I liked her tone, her energy, her perspective, and I appreciated so much the inclusion of some of her primary sources (and information on where to get more--she has a great bibliography). It is quite impressive and I really want to recognize that. Unfortunately for me, she took all my favorite things about the book and turned them into the footnotes to a rather dull and uninteresting story instead of making them the story and illustrating more cohesively all the information she imparts in the footnotes and endnotes. If she ever uses her great creative and research skills to write a book that is not an alternate-universe steampunk fantasy--and I hope she does--I am definitely hunting it down and reading it."
24,0141981539,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2168708-marta,4,"Delightful, thoroughly researched, and discombobulated. Sidney Padua lovingly draws Ada Lovelace and Charles Babbage's friendship, the (theoretical) invention of the first computer by Babbage, and the first computer program by Lovelace. Both were peculiar and memorable characters, whose friendship ranged from mathematical discourse to special fondness asnd squabbles. As Lovelace died young, which would make for a short book, Padua opts to keep her and their cooperation alive in a ""Pocket Universe"", where they embark upon adventures addressing Victorian era problems in economy, literature, inventions and mathematics. I particularly liked the exlanations of math jokes in Alice in Wonderland - the dialogue makes a lot more sense to me now.I thoroughly enjoyed the content, however the format was a real chore that deducted from my enjoyment a lot. The cartoons are quite silly and often contrast the dialogue which is quoted from comtemporary texts; they also contrast the immense amount of information conveyed through footnotes, endnotes and appendixes. The cartoons are large, the footnotes are small font, the endnotes are larger font, and I had to keep two bookmarks to flip between endnotes and story, which was already disjointed into cartoons and footnotes. The cartoons/footnotes are often self-referential, which lightens this a bit; but smetimes they dissolve into complicated charts and even Esher-like turns into sideways or upside down.Padua clearly enjoyed the book, and so did I, but it would have been a lot better with a more linear story-telling style."
25,0141981539,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19606075-tagwa-warrag,5,"An autobigraphical comics about the history of computers in a way that exceeded my expectations. i love love love Ada Lovelace and reading about her work makes me appreciate more how people like her and Babbage paved the way for what we have today in technology. It makes me want to read more about people as Alan Turning, Grace Hopper, Margaret Hamilton, and many mooooore.Then I remembered how in high school we were taught about the earliest generations of mechanical calculaters and how they evolve to modern computers, the story of Charles Babbage BUT there was NOT a single word about Ada Lovelace in the computer books back then. Dunno why. anyway ... The amount of researching that Sydney has put into this book is just tremendously tremendously impressing! And the funny & cool way she used in telling the facts and stories just made it even more awesom-er !! I was even laughing out loud at some parts while reading it on public bus!I think no one else would have illustrated it a better way. This comics simply cant get any better i think it is perfect. I was a bit lost at some of the mechanical details but it is always good to get general knowledge about these stuff. I just want to thank Al Rashied For bringing me a hardcover copy from UAE. Forever grateful. : )"
26,0141981539,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15552932-bekah,5,"This is not your average graphic novel. In fact, it is more akin to a highly humorous and well illustrated text book. If you love history, mathematics, coding/computing/etc, then this is right up your alley. Go grab it right now! Others may find it very interesting as well, but may feel overwhelmed by all the footnotes/end notes/annotations/references. You could easily just flick through and enjoy the art, but I recommend slowing down and taking the time to read. It was fascinating and I was thoroughly impressed by how much research and attention to detail was put into it."
27,0141981539,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7205386-steven-brown,5,"A superb example of what a free ranging and creative graphic novel can be. Imagine a mashup between computing, Victorian engineering, and ""The Avengers"" (Steed and Peel, not that comics stuff.) Very educational and enormous fun. Highly recommended. Hope for more Victoriana and science history from Padua."

Read the comics , just didn't read all the endnotes (quite tedious ). You can tell Sydney Padua did put in a lot of work because it is very well researched and the artwork is pretty awesome too but it just wasn't for me . Wasn't totally bad . I think I'll bump it up to 3 stars because the book deserves it . "
29,0141981539,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6962944-ana-mar-a,5,"Brilliant, brilliant, brilliant! Highly recommended to anyeveryone. Padua takes a footnote in history and creates a Pocket Universe of lovely possibility (full of historical footnotes of her own). Thanks to Minkowski space-time, there are even more adventures (and hilarity) to be had."

32,0141981539,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7366675-morgan,5,"Do you fancy computer history, steampunk, and fine English literature? If you said yes to any of these than this comic book is for you. Keep in mind that even though this is a comic book this book has a ton of footnotes and reading material. In a way this is more of a non-fiction book with some comic book humor. This isn't your typical comic book. In someways this reminds me of a friendlier From Hell.I'm not really into computers, how they work, or the history for that matter. For me that can really boring. While this comic was mostly about that, what interested me more was Ada Lovelace's life and her relationship with her famed father Lord Byron. But wait, there's more! As I said before there is a lot of facts about English authors and literature for the 1800's. George Eliot makes a big appearance which I got super nerdy with excitement. Nice to see one of my favorite authors in a comic book. Maybe more people will read her books now.There are other author references too. At the end, there is a whole parody/homage to Lewis Carroll and his Wonderland. Yes Wonderland is an overused concept, but this comic focused on the mathematical part behind the story that others tend to forget Carroll was a mathematician. There is also an apprentice of Dickens, Collins, Gaskell, and a small cameo of Austen. It might help to do some Victorian reading before reading this comic book, while she gives you a good idea who they are, parts she don't really tell you much about the books they wrote that she quotes.If you like comic books, you might like this. Like I said before this really isn't a comic book. It uses the term lightly. Very little of the book is actually comics. It's more of a non-fiction book. The drawing my look cute, but this isn't kid friendly either. There were parts (especially the appendix pages) that were way over my head. I'm glad the author clearly took her time doing research. Some of the non-fiction comic books I question were they get there idea if they don't source enough.I'm interested to she if Padua makes anymore comic books. I like her art style, but I like how this was a different kind of comic book collection for me. I may have learned more about computers than I would have ever wanted, but it was worth it, and I have more respect for Lovelace and Babbage."
33,0141981539,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7708524-wreade1872,4,"Really liked it, just the sort of thing for me but not quite sure for how many others?Things you might need to know or like to enjoy this:Computer Programming,, i've done some.Victorian History, check for me, i don't think this is the best introduction to victorian history some prior knowledge would be useful.Engineering, no for me, the actual descriptions of Babbages machine were a bit hard for me to follow at times.Comics, check for me, Biography, check for me, sort of, i'm not a hardcore biography person and this was a perfect amount of fact. It also preferred to rely on tidbits from letters, magazines etc, Its definitely entertainment first, information second which i much prefer to a straight forward dry biography, however informative.Mathematics, apparently a no for me, despite liking math in general some of the stuff in this went over my head.The author also used Archive.org and googlebook scans to find some of her info which made me like this that little bit more as i love raiding those places for obscure books.Some notes on the physical object: My edition stinks, like literally, smells like paint or turpentine, of course this wears off after a while but not the best first impression. Not sure if its the ink or paper but i was actually holding it at arms length when i started reading it.Secondly the book is divided into comic, then footnotes below them and then additional endnotes after each chapter. Except its really annoying if you want to refer to an endnote as you can't easily find them, especially since there is no uniform length to any of the chapters. They should have blackened the corners of the endnote pages, so they could be easily seen when flicking through the pages... hold on.. one black marker and some time later ... ok done, now MY book has black corners on all the endnote pages, which can be found super easy :D .Note: Be careful with this, make sure to have a piece of cardboard behind the page, the black marker soaks though the paper REALLY easily."
34,0141981539,http://goodreads.com/user/show/310857-allie,5,"I loved this comic SO MUCH! There are so many footnotes! Footnotes for days! I love love love books where fun chunks of the story and/or jokes happen in the footnotes (See: my new footnotes love shelf)! I loved how much research Sydney Padua did about Lovelace & Babbage and the awesome appreciation she has for primary source documents. There was so much glee in her tone! Aside from the footnotes, the very first part of this comic tells the true story of Lovelace & Babbage, their lives, their math, their friendship, etc. The rest of the comic happens in a pocket universe where they fight crime. I generally think steampunk stuff is kind of lame, but this was super fun. A lot of the action and characters were tempered with Padua's explanations of the implausibility, but since it takes place in a pocket universe who cares! Let everybody hangout together! Why the heck not!Recommended for fans of Victorian lit, fellow footnotes lovers, and STEM folks who love comics. "
35,0141981539,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51524202-clelixedda,5,"This book is almost an instant favourite, it’s just so charming, funny, entertaining and educational (so it ticks all the boxes). The graphic novel part of this book consists of small musings of what could have happened if Babbage had actually build his analytical engine and Ada Lovelace had lived long enough to witness it. It is set in what the author calls a “pocket universe”, a two-dimensional world with elements of steam punk. The illustrations are great, but, to be honest, the foot and endnotes shadow the story part. They are extensively researched and the reader learns a lot about the lives of Lovelace and Babbage, and, more importantly, about their research work. Apart from that, they are also funny. What really sold this book for me was the second appendix, where the analytical engine is explained in some detail, with a lot of helpful (and awesome) illustrations. "
36,0141981539,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1392101-scarlett-sims,5,"I knew I would love a graphic novel about Lovelace and Babbage, I just didn't realize how much. Padua has done some truly great research in telling the story of the two people who *almost* made the first computer. A lot of the ""adventures"" she describes didn't really happen, but they still contain lots of fun tidbits about many other famous Victorians. There are two appendices, one of which contains a handful of the primary sources the author unearthed while researching the book and they are really treasures. I will say, her voice is very ""millenial."" She apparently drew this as a webcomic first and she definitely talks like an Internet person. I grew up on the Internet so that sounds natural to me, but I imagine for some people it might seem jarring. I absolutely looooved this book!"
37,0141981539,http://goodreads.com/user/show/142980-rachel,3,"I was expecting a graphic novel about Lovelace and Babbage. I wasn't expecting a loosely organized set of long historical footnotes about Lovelace and Babbage, complete with primary sources in the appendix! This is not really a graphic novel. I feel like Padua could have integrated her information and her comic art better, to be more like a graphic novel. That said, this is something she did in her spare time out of a love for Victorian times and of course, Babbage and Lovelace. Her footnotes are humorous, splendidly researched, and plentiful. I found Ada Lovelace's upbringing fascinating, but most of the information was about her teenage and 20-something involvement with Babbage in thinking about computing machines. "

I have always been interested in Ada Lovelace so I knew I would enjoy it but I didn't expect how much sass and whit there was going to be. For that, I loved this story. You can tell the author did her research while creating this book. The footnotes alone make the read worth it. Each of the characters is built up out of the research that was done and feel completely real, as if I could walk up to them and have a conversation that would make sense for their personalities. I giggled my way through most of this read, I won't like. The computer, math and logic jokes were perfect. This is probably one of my favorite reads of the year."
39,0141981539,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2315520-kylie,5,As someone who has a hard time completing non-fiction books this was perfect more me. The fact that 50% of it was focused on an under appreciated woman from history also definitely helped to keep me interested.The mix of primary sources and helpful foot notes throughout the fictional tellings made for a super engaging read. Padua brings characters to life in ways that only a cartoonist would but has obviously done so much research on the subject that everything feel informative and smart while also light and humorous. I'll admit that I couldn't understand all the math that was talked about in this but that didn't stop me from being captivated by the history.
40,0141981539,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2863963-andree,4,This was fun! I very much enjoyed how this was done. Particularly Lovelace reigning in Babbage. And the Duke of Wellington just standing around looking disapproving most of the time. Also enjoyed how over the top Isambard Kingdom Brunnel was. This made me laugh. Particularly Lovelace's anti-poetry sentiments.
41,0141981539,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15425257-althea-j,5,"For a great review of this book, check out my friend Oriana's!! I read her's after I wrote mine and I like her's better :)https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...I love love this premise that combines rich historical context with crazy sciencey imagination. It's like a DC Comics Elseworlds story, except instead of using the DC canon universe as a jumping off point, Padua uses history as a jumping off point for her imaginative adventures.In order to deviate from history, you gotta understand the history first, so that gives a great excuse for the reader to delve into the historical context of Lovelace and Babbage. But annotated with funny footnotes, sourced with real historical documents, and enhanced by her graphic storytelling, it hardly feels like a history lesson at all!!! ---- My impulse is to see the educative capacity of everything I encounter, so I immediately was inspired to analyze this format and its potential as a teaching tool. In case that bores you, I'm shaving it down and putting it as a spoiler below. Here's the ""TL;DR"" of my review: I love the tremendous potential of Padua's multi-layered approach!!!(view spoiler)[After laying down some biographical/historical context, Padua then offers the parameters for the ""Pocket Universe"" in which her adventures take place. For example, to explain why there is no mention of Lovelace's boring husband:""The fundamental law of the Pocket Universe may be expressed as E=mc2[squared]where E represents Entertainment Value. Charles Babbage and Ada Lovelace are so entertaining it is hardly surprising they are the massiest objects in the Pocket Universe. Conversely, consider Lovelace's husband, Lord Lovelace. After exhaustive investigations I have determined that his Entertainment Value, or E, is precisely zero."" (pg 41)And a footnote to her explanation of why the adventures take place in their own bubble outside of time:""This state of fuzziness holds, like much of the information contained in this comic, until it receives close scrutiny, whereupon it collapses."" (pg 41)The self-awareness of Padua's voice in the footnotes and appendices really brings the reader into her process of investigating her subjects. This effectively heightens the excitement of the subject matter because it cuts to the fun ""Aha!"" moment of discovery. It also brings the reader into how fulfilling it is to make connections. For example, ""Finding the Faraday letter... was my introduction to the very great thrill of throw-down victory in Combat Scholarship."" (pg 275)In a great section titled, ""Imaginary Quantities"" Padua puts forth the fundamental challenge of portraying history - there are no absolute Truths, only impressions gathered from various sources. She cites the warring schools of thoughts re: Lovelace - mathematical genius or ignorant imposter? Padua then makes her investigatory process explicit, describing her adventures with Google Books and the excitement of her own discovery of a primary document that recounts Babbage's own opinion of Lovelace. That he, ""knew her intimately and spoke highly of her mathematical powers, and of her peculiar capability---higher he said than of any one he knew, to prepare...the descriptions connected with his calculating machine."" (pg 242) This is a finding that is substantial in clarifying the issue in favor of Lovelace-as-genius, and in doing so, demonstrates the value of research and its potential reward.The adventures themselves offer multiple levels of information, the drawings/story portion offering a jumping off point for further investigation. The reader encounters footnotes on nearly every page, which offer historical context and commentary to the fantastical drawing/story. Padua essentially offers the dual voice of fun fiction and factually-rooted informational color on every page. An even deeper understanding can be found in the endnotes to each story section, and the primary documents included in the back of the book. Because all of these layers are linked with asterisks and annotational numbers, the reader can actively pursue and access deeper understanding in the moment that their curiosity is piqued by the story, making them an active participant in discovery.from my notes:pg 115Holy sh%$! This little historical adventure comic just snuck in some economic theory. I inadvertently learned the concept of the ""fiscal multiplier"" because it was a punchline to a joke. Usually my eyes glaze over with anything economics-related, but I was invested in poring over the footnote to understand the concept so I could ""get"" the joke. A great example of the intrinsic motivation to learn that lay within this format of graphic novel/semi-fictitious story with factual footnotes.I really enjoyed the inclusion of some of the primary documents that Padua encountered in her research. Like the recollection of Babagge speaking about ""The Difference Engine"" in the Sunny Memories excerpts:""He assured me that when it was finished it would 'analyse everything, and reduce everything to its first principles and so include future inventions, and in short almost supersede the human mind.'"" Aaaaand thusly, the computer was born. What a great find!I also liked Babbage's answer to that age-old question asked by every student in every math class ever -- Why do I have to learn this? It's not like I'm going to be using this in life.""In mathematical science, more than in all others, it happens that truths which are at one period the most abstract, and apparently the most remote from all useful application, become in the next age the bases of profound physical inquiries, and in the succeeding one, perhaps, by proper simplification and reduction to tables, furnish their ready and daily aid to the artist and the sailor.""In other words, learn your calculus, kids, so you can invent the next cutting edge thing we as a society can use to progress.Also, by the way, a great answer to the politicians that want to de-fund any efforts of science that don't currently have explicit application. (hide spoiler)]The information contained in this book spans so many subjects - math, science, economics, philosophy, history, etc. But I think the most important takeaway is the thrill of discovery and the adventure of acting on the impulses of curiosity. This is demonstrated in the characters of Babbage and Lovelace, as well as in Padua's inclusion of her own voice, and the book itself as a product of her own pursuit of knowledge. She portrays herself as a novice and includes her own excitement of discovery in her process, making the process of intellectual pursuit seem to be something that the reader could take on for themselves."
42,0141981539,http://goodreads.com/user/show/81756322-celia-t,5,"God I love this book. When I was 14 I actually got to meet and have lunch with Sydney Padua, which was (1) good because I was obsessed with the webcomic and transported at coming face to face with its creator, but also (2) bad because I was extremely awkward and weird even by 14-year-old standards and I made a complete fool of myself. They say you shouldn't meet your heroes in case they're a disappointment; actually you shouldn't meet your heroes because YOU will be a disappointment. Sydney if you're ever in Canada and you want to hang out again I'm 23 now and like 30% more capable of carrying on a conversation like a human being. Anyways, I love Lovelace and Babbage and their antics just as much as I always did. Also I'm going to fight everyone on this website who gave this book a low rating because there were ""too many footnotes"". There is no such thing as too many footnotes. Grow up. "
43,0141981539,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6137009-aaron-burkhalter,4,"Sydney Padua walks a precarious tightrope holding together two fascinating historical figures, a lighthearted storyline and exhaustive footnotes telling a fictional (albeit based on reality) story of Ada Lovelace and Charles Babbage, a mathematician and engineer respectively who are credited for attempting but never completing a steam powered, mechanical computer in Victorian England, which would have been the first had it come together.It's an idea that never should have worked. Wes Anderson's actually mocks in ""The Royal Tennenbaums"" the concept that Padua has taken and run with. Owen's very first line introduces him as a minor literary celebrity describing his latest book: ""Well, everyone knows Custer died at Little Bighorn. What this book presupposes is... maybe he didn't?"" Likewise, everyone knows that Ada Lovelace died at age 36 after working on what are by some considered the first earliest computer programs to be used in Charles Babbage's planned ""Analytical Machine."" Everyone knows that Babbage never completed the steam-powered computer. What Padua's book presupposes is... maybe Lovelace didn't die and they did complete the computer?In Padua's story, we are introduced to an alternate universe in which Lovelace and Babbage complete the analytical machine and flummox famous people of Victorian England with their antics. Queen Victoria arrives to witness the machine and is amused to see it print out a text image of a cat. George Eliot is lost in the machine chasing the only manuscript of one of her books which Lovelace and Babbage hope to digitize and study using computer punch cards. It's a precarious premise that works thanks to Padua's comedic sensibilities and the deeply interesting subjects in question. At one point in the story, we see an imagined conversation between Lovelace and Babbage at a party. Babbage is gushing over one invention that he did complete, a mechanical calculator called ""The Difference Machine,"" and Lovelace is in awe. In Padua's retelling, the two are seen as finally meeting an intellectual equal, someone who understands how the other's brain works. An onlooker quips that we're witnessing the invention of the geek.Padua is an accomplished animator — she worked on The Iron Giant — and her skills are well on display. The book, though comprised of still images, is alive with motion.The story manages to balance her comedic story, the ridiculousness of an alternate steam-punk universe and the exhaustively researched history all in one. Almost every page is amended with seemingly endless footnotes describing where the dialogue has come from (much is quoted from diaries and letters) and explaining obscure but often hilarious jokes at the expense of Victorian historical figures. The footnotes are necessary to anyone like myself, with limited knowledge about Victorian England. I imagine some well-versed historian could read through just the comics on the page and giggling through the entire book. I, however, need someone to explain to me why some mathematical joke is funny, and somehow the joke is not spoiled by the detailed explanation.If the book has a downside, it's that the footnotes on each page and the end notes closing each chapter can become a bit of a chore to read when you were hoping for a comic. But it won't do to skip them: The footnotes are themselves interesting, often essential to understanding the story and also offer an amusing interplay between the characters and the author. In fact, Padua frequently breaks the wall between the comic book story and the footnotes at the bottom of the page. Queen Victoria at one point orders the footnotes to cease. And without spoiling the ending (if a story like this is spoilable) the end of the story is pages upon pages of interplay between Lovelace and the footnotes."

(Neal Stephenson's Cryptonomicon and Norman Spinrad 's (?) Roma Eterna, and the recent computer game Dishonored 2, spring to mind as prominent examples of the genre, but none of them reaches the level of literary erudition of this book.) +++ Excellent visual explanation of the Analytical Engine's components and how they work, in Appendix II. +++ New and historically relevant material about the relationship between Ada Lady Lovelace and Charles Babbage, hopefully settling for posterity the important role Ada had in the symbolic, abstract interpretation of the capabilities of the Analytical Engine, including for algorithmic calculus (that is, computer algorithms). Although the author points to scholarly work where Babbage is credited with inventing the first algorithms for the Engine, she explains credibly and cites knowledgeably new source material supporting Ada's significant and innovative contribution (we are talking about prints from mid- and late-1800s, found by Sidney Padua). Overall, I loved the book and recommend it to everyone, and especially to computer scientists and others mathematically inclined."
45,0141981539,http://goodreads.com/user/show/418103-david,5,"This is a great book that helped me understand the work Charles Babbage and Lady Lovelace did conceiving the first computer as a mechanical device in the 1800s. On the surface, it's a graphic novel that starts with the true story of Lovelace and Babbage, then imagines an alternate world where Lovelace and Babbage actually created the Analytical Engine (a successor to the more famous Difference Engine). The real meat of the book, though is in the footnotes and endnotes where Padua cites her sources for the material used in the cartoons. She wraps up the book with a collection of letters and citations about Babbage and Lovelace, and a look at how the Analytical Engine was conceived. A great introduction to these historical characters and their work for an interested non-expert like me."
46,0141981539,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23079142-sarah-coolcurrybooks,5,"The Thrilling Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage is an absolutely delightful graphic novel that contains a wealth of historical information regarding Ada Lovelace, Charles Babbage, and the history of computing while at the same time being relentlessly entertaining.The book begins with a brief history of Ada Lovelace, Charles Babbage, and their work on the invention of the computer and computer programming. However, both died before any of the machines Babbage planned were ever invented. And so Padua imagines an alternate ending – a world where their Analytical Engine reached completion and adventures ensue.Padua’s art is wonderfully effective. Her black and white drawings are imbued with energy and life, and I’m completely jealous of her skill at creating such wonderfully expressive faces!In the foreword, Sydney Padua describes how the book began as a brief comic she created at a friend’s request for Ada Lovelace Day. When the end of her comic suggested an alternate universe, various corners of the internet thought she was planning a webcomic about steampunk style adventures between the duo. Although Padua had no such plans in mind, she began researching Ada Lovelace and Charles Babbage, and she wound up becoming utterly fascinated with Lovelace, Babbage, and the Analytical Engine. And Padua’s passion for her subject matter shines through at every turn, and the book is so much greater for it.Padua also found much potential humor lying in wait. For instance, Charles Babbage had a long lasting vendetta against street musicians. Even when Padua is departing on some flight of fantasy, she still provides extensive footnotes on historical information. I’m not kidding, there’s pages and pages of footnotes, and I highly suggest reading all of them. They’re both knowledgeable and engaging. I ended up learning a lot in the process of reading The Thrilling Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage, and like all the best books that dabble in history, it left me with a desire to go out and learn more.I can’t recommend this altogether charming collection enough.Originally posted on The Illustrated Page."
47,0141981539,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34270033-katie,2,"I am so sadly disappointed in not loving this book. Unfortunately I developed an expectation of it before getting it, where I had imagined it was somehow a graphic novel biography. When I started reading it and it was like ""jk their life isn't interesting enough so now we will have a pocket universe where they have thrilling adventures and fight crime,"" I was on board with that too. However, it never clicked for me. I'm legitimately confused about how it has such a good rating, to be honest.Pros:- The art is just fabulous. I love it SO MUCH.- The found letters in the appendices are interesting.- The author obviously put a lot of effort into research and seems like a great person.Cons:- In my opinion this is neither a graphic novel nor a biography. Or it tries to be both, more accurately. Most pages are half cartoon half footnote. I think perhaps it might be enjoyable if you JUST read the cartoons and not the footnotes. I had half a notion to do that myself, and I'm guessing most people must do that and have a great time (thus the high rating). I would probably recommend that, as much of the information in the footnotes is also repeated in the appendices (at least the parts about Ada and Babbage).- Because of the large amounts of footnotes that are usually not very related to the comic, even the chapter stories feel incoherent to me. I have a huge problem with graphic novels that don't have a coherent story (at least in the individual chapters). I think this is why I generally dislike compilations of web comics.- Related to the above, I didn't realize this is a compilation of web comics. I'm still a little confused about that, but it seems to be true. It feels like it too, based on the lack of coherency imho.- While I love the idea of historical quotes and events being used in a fictional story, it's really confusing to me. I don't know if this means I hate historical fiction or just didn't like the use of it here. I almost would've liked the quotes being used in the cartoons WITHOUT the footnote saying where/when/how the actual quote originally came to be.WOW THAT WAS LONG I CLEARLY HAVE FEELINGS.tl;dr: if you get this, maybe just don't read the footnotes and you'll have a great time."
48,0141981539,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16103061-kathleen,5,"OKAY SO.Ada Lovelace (or, as she's more properly known, Augusta Ada King, Countess of Lovelace) is commonly cited as the world's first computer programmer. Since she died in 1852, you can see how revolutionary that is. Her partnership with Charles Babbage, who almost but not quite built the first computer (the Analytical Engine), and the ensuing paperwork helped Alan Turing to build probably the first functioning computer in the 1940s. Now, Ada Lovelace died at the age of 36 and Charles Babbage never really got his shit together enough to actually build the computer. In The Thrilling Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage, Sydney Padua asks the all-important question: what if Lovelace had lived and Babbage built his device?Answer: HILARITY.Padua wrote and illustrated a brief biographical sketch of Lovelace and intended it to stop there. Unsurprisingly it developed into this comic. It's really hard to describe in terms other than Padua's-- ""Lovelace and Babbage lived on and built a giant calculating Engine and used it to FIGHT CRIME and HAVE ADVENTURES""-- but that also doesn't quite do the comic justice and it certainly doesn't mention the hilarious one-shot about George Boole, Lovelace and Babbage's wars on poetry and street music respectively, and ISAMBARD KINGDOM BRUNEL whose name must always be written in all caps. It also doesn't mention that pretty much everyone in the comic is a historical personage and far more of it is taken directly from historical accounts than one would expect-- including Babbage's war on street music, which is a thing of glory and joy.I would recommend purchasing the book if only to have it, but you can read the comic at Padua's website and I believe you can also get some kind of app to read it in? IDEK, it's amazing, go and find it by any means necessary and then throw money at Sydney Padua so we can get more."
49,0141981539,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2830383-jeff,4,"A fun graphic novel ""loosely"" based on the life and friendship of Ada Lovelace (more properly Ada Byron, Lovelace is her title, her husband was the Earl of Lovelace) and Charles Babbage. Babbage is credited as the father of the first mechanical computer (the Difference Engine) and the designer of the much more complex Analytical Engine (never built). Lovelace (who's father was the poet Lord Byron) was educated in mathematics and science from a very early age. She wrote (among other things) an analysis of the functioning and capabilities of the Analytical Engine, that contained was is regarded as the first computer program. The speculation in this book is, what would happen if they had actually been able to build the Analytical Engine and write code to program the machine. This speculation happens in a pocket universe where Padua can let her imagination flow. This book had a very interesting structure. Its the first book where I needed 2 bookmarks. Each page of each chapter had footnotes that related to the action in the various panels. There were also endnotes that further clarified the footnotes, as well as several appendices of various period documents (letters and articles) that helped emphasis the story.What both fascinates me and frustrates me is that I'm not sure what's true and what's fiction. Obviously the main story is fiction, but the footnotes and endnotes provide excellent historical backup, but in some cases, I think, ""that can't be true, can it?"". Its witty, self-deprecating and I thoroughly enjoyed it. While I knew of Babbage and Lovelace beforehand, this give me incentive to read more about them.8/10S: 1/21/15 - F: 2/8/16 (19 Days)"
50,0141981539,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36607817-tony-zale,5,"The Thrilling Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage is a graphic novel romp, but it also has plenty of meat on its bones. Charles Babbage was a mathematician and inventor better at dreaming up projects like a steam powered calculator than completing them. Ada Lovelace was the daughter of Lord Byron, pushed towards mathematics in the hopes disciplined study would save her from her father’s excesses. Together, they envisioned a world of computing that wouldn’t be fulfilled for more than a century. Author/illustrator Sydney Padua takes this theoretical reality and dresses it up in fiction; the dynamic duo actually build their computing machine and bring big data computing to the Victorian era. An ever-expanding computer made of gears and powered by boilers is a silly concept, but Padua skillfully incorporates passages from historic journals and correspondence into her dialog, bridging the gap back to the real Lovelace and Babbage. The book is heavily footnoted, providing additional context on the workings of Babbage’s machine, the duo’s connection with high society and figures like Karl Marx, Babbage’s pedantic criticism of poets and reviewers of his books, and oddities of the era’s mathematics like revolutionary France’s brief conversion to a 400 degree circle. These notes provide color and are a pleasure to read; they aren’t overly deep, but they display a level of research the reader won’t expect from a light graphic novel. This is an excellent package: a cast of eccentric, expressively illustrated characters and a fanciful look at Victorian engineering that doesn’t go too far off the steampunk deep end."

Even though I still have no clue about any of the mathematical stuff discussed, it's still an amazingly awesome romp through alternate history. Lovelace and Babbage's friendship is YAS, and PUNCHYCARD KITTIES xD, and Minion is amazing, and FOOTNOTES OMG, and overall just... YAAAASSSS.I'm not giving this 4.5 stars, even though it easily could be, due to the footnotes. While I adore footnotes, gleaned lots of interesting info from them, and appreciate the satirical homage paid to Lovelace (her footnotes are famously longer than papers themselves), they distracted a bit too much from the comics the way they were presented. However, fear not! The comics are just as enjoyable if you ignore the footnotes (although you certainly won't get explanation for much of the historical tidbits that are worked into the comics). I conducted highly involved experiments.... heh, not really. I read through each story a first time, in full, reading the footnotes along with the comics, then did a second read-through of just the comics with no notes. I found it to be immensely educational the first time, and immensely amusing the second time 'round.Go read it peoples, it's the definition of adorkables. Even if you have no mathematical inclination at all, it's highly readable and AWESOME. And if you are mathematically inclined... well, then get ready to be blown away by the nerdiness of it all.(Cross posted on my blog.)"

Sydney Padua's first collection of works about the steampunky and quirky duo sure is entertaining and humorous, but it really lacks a cohesive story that could have sustained my interest until the end.This comics (and almost a graphic novel) is the author's own interpretation of the life of Lovelace and Babbage, in a pocket universe where they have finished creating the Analytical Engine. This very premise topped with interesting foot and end notes and amazing artwork, oh I'm telling you the artwork alone is delicious to see, was unfortunately let down by the absence of a cohesive story. It is way far from a complete disappointment though, but I am a bit sad that so much material, well-researched documents and talent was seen in the book yet (almost hurts to sat this) it doesn't kept me reading it because there was no solid plot for them to keep going.I eventually finished reading it (comics plus the end notes) wishing that more could have been done to improve it."

Although I truly enjoyed much of the nonfiction side of this book (first 50 pages and the footnotes), I lost interest after they entered the world of the ""Pocket Universe."" With the exception of the Dodgson/Alice section, I wasn't compelled by their adventures or hijinks. I finally resorted to reading the comic through without stopping for footnotes and then coming back to read those to fill in the details. If I were to recommend this to a friend, I think that is how it should be read during the fictional accounts - read the comic through and come back to the footnotes. After I did that it was a much more satisfying experience. All in all, I would really give it 2.5 stars."

I think even some footnotes had footnotes. There were just a lot of footnotes. I think it's clear that the author has great passion for these two characters and some stuff made me really chuckle a lot. Overall a 3.5 starts for me, what let it down for me, was just the sheer amount of footnotes. When you have to explain so much about your story, then you are not really telling it all that well or you think your readers are a bit stupid.

I was vaguely familiar with Ada Lovelace, Byron's mathematical daughter, and not at all familiar with mathematician Charles Babbage. Apparently they were great friends, Lovelace's Analytical Engine (while never actually built) was a plan for the first (steam-powered) computer, and Lovelace had all kinds of brilliant software ideas that would have taken computing out of the realm of arithmetic and into the realm of symbols. Padua's enthusiastic and highly footnoted explanations were often over my head, but I loved them. I also enjoyed how she rewrote history to fashion L and B as steampunk adventurers. "

66,0141981539,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8590635-chad,5,"TL;DR Summary: I found this book amazing, inspiring, and perhaps a little magnificent. Having read it, and the author's commentary, it's easy for me to understand how the author found the subject of Ada Lovelace's life so captivating. The remainder of this review is a description of how, and why, it had such a significant impact on me when I read it.For more than a quarter century, I recall thinking at almost all times that I disliked math. I then encountered a math teacher in college, Dr. Blaga Pauley, whose engaging and philosophical teaching style -- which felt more like a conversation about what was most intriguing about math than like formal education -- helped me realize that what I disliked so strongly was not math itself, but the way people seem to think it must be dictated and drilled. Math is, in fact, a beautiful realm of brilliant insights, elegant systems, intricate designs, and the power to create new understanding.I was not (within myself) ready to carry on with math as a more significant pursuit on my own, yet, and a variety of circumstances conspired to keep me from getting the kind of mentorship I needed to reach that readiness. It is difficult to break free from decades of being indoctrinated in the belief that mathematics is a bureaucratic, dreary, tedious field of academic irrelevance, and other (more comfortable, at the time) interests easily distracted me from taking my education in math any further than strictly necessary for all the interests I pursued instead. Even so, the ideas around math as presented by Blaga (before she passed away) stuck with me, and led me to collect a few books for later reading -- a ""later"" that, until now, never came.Along the way, I heard of this book, and someone gave it to me as a gift. Perhaps it was because I asked for it; I don't recall. Time passed, and this year (2019) I finally picked it up and read it. Reading this awoke in me a greater interest in the real-world intellectual adventures of the Countess of Lovelace (the evident originator of general-purpose programming as a field of study and perhaps even the foundation-layer of computer science) and Charles Babbage (the inventor of the Analytical Engine). More significantly for me, perhaps, is the fact this book is what seems to have finally pushed me over the precipice into a plunge into the depths of desire to really learn more about (and seek fuller understanding of) mathematics as a field of exploration rather than simple study. This book has changed my mindset again, like Blaga's instruction did almost twenty years ago, and I rather suspect that when I think back on this in a few years I will be able to say that those two events together have conspired to change my life.I do not know whether this book can help change anyone else's life for the better, but I recommend it without reservation to anyone considering whether it is worth reading. If you hesitated to dedicate time to it before reading this review, hesitate no longer. It really was an amazing experience for me, and I hope it will be for you, too."
67,0141981539,http://goodreads.com/user/show/772327-christopher,4,"Oh my was this fun! I enjoyed the heck out of this book. My daughter enjoyed the heck out of this book. It's clear the author enjoyed the heck out of this book.So the book starts with a historical account of Charles Babbage, Ada Lovelace, and the Difference Engine (and it's progeny the Analytical Engine) - presented in an entertaining storytelling style, complete with footnotes and endnotes - (akin to the Cartoon History of the Universe I, Vol. 1-7: From the Big Bang to Alexander the Great). So far, so good. But this section ends quickly and on a down-note with Lovelace dead of cancer and Babbage unable to get over himself to actually build any of his designs.But as we have seen in so much alternate history from The Difference Engine to Fiddlehead, the idea of a Victorian-era steam-and-cogs computer is just too good to let facts reign and history to have the last say. So Sydney Padua transports us to a pocket universe where the laws of physics are set to maximize entertainment value and the book roars onward, now looking increasingly like Girl Genius, Vol. 1: Agatha Heterodyne and the Beetleburg Clank only with a historically accurate cast of characters instead of a fictional one (well except for Minion the Footman).Oh, and the footnotes continue. Almost every statement uttered by Lovelace, Babbage, or various supporting characters in the book is straight from their own writings or supported with primary documents. And the supporting cast is broad from the Duke of Wellington, to Islambard Kingdom Brunel, to George Eliot, to Lewis Carroll/Charles Dodgson, to Queen Victoria herself. Eventually the footnotes themselves become a character in a Wonderland-inspired investigation into the truth of Ada Lovelace's character and contribution to the Analytical Engine and computer science as a field.And throughout this all, as we watch these absurd Victorian characters and learn about the design of the Analytical Engine and the logic of computing, there's another story being told. The author is able to show us so much about Babbage and Lovelace's personalities and victories because of the triumph of computing. The Google Books project and others like it have opened the world of historical primary sources to interested amateurs like Padua in a way that really has never been possible before. The author is able to wade into decades-old debates with a sharp pen and over-looked sources because of the work of Babbage and Lovelace's intellectual progeny who have continued the drive to organize, collate, and analyze the world's knowledge."
68,0141981539,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27837035-heather-jones,5,"This is a delightfully informative and madcap graphic biography (sort-of) of Ada Lovelace and her relationship with proto-computer inventor Charles Babbage and his research. I found it reminiscent of such genre-fracturing works as Larry Gonick’s The Cartoon History of… series or Scott McCloud’s Understanding Comics in the way it simultaneously uses and subverts the conventions of graphic storytelling to bridge the worlds of education and entertainment. (No doubt there are many other works that do similar things, but I don't actually follow graphic novels much, so these are the ones I thought of.)It begins as a straightforward biography of Augusta Ada King, Countess Lovelace, daughter of the mad poet Lord Byron, and very arguably the first computer programmer. The visual storytelling is expanded by the use of footnotes (which often interact amusingly with the other graphic elements) and extensive endnotes that expand on technical points, or issues and personages contemporary to the main themes. (I read it in iBooks format and the e-text has been set up to allow easy movement between the main panels, the endnotes, and large-text versions of both foot- and endnotes.)But the author, having to her dismay hit the limits of pure biography, due to Lovelace’s tragically short life and Babbage’s failure to actually realize any of his amazing inventions, plunges on sideways into an alternate steampunk universe in which Lovelace and Babbage actually build the analytical engine and use it to…wait for it…fight crime! (And other adventurous pursuits.) Here the story explodes into a mash-up of actual history, deranged tour through the political and literary landscape of mid-19th century Britain, and technical manual.I loved how the story returned to the essentials of steampunk as a genre (as opposed to an artistic aesthetic) in highlighting the exploits of larger-than-life 19th century figures whose dreams and inventive imaginations outstripped the technology of the day. It does not, however, ignore the aesthetic side of steampunk, and aficionados will find all their favorite goggles, Rube-Goldbergian technology, and dashing women in gender-bending historic clothing.Whether you read the central graphic story purely as entertainment, or delve deeply enough into the technical appendices to understand just how Babbage’s engine was intended to work (and the reasons why it was unlikely to have done so), or split the difference by meditating on the ways in which a brilliant mind like Lovelace’s was betrayed and undermined by the age she lived in, this is a book I recommend in the strongest terms."
69,0141981539,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5033966-kaia,5,"First things first, let's get some assumptions out of the way. 1) This book has a lot of footnotes and endnotes. I did not count, but there may be more footnotes/endnotes than actual graphic content. That being said, they are absolutely charming footnotes that I loved reading. Granted, the historical Lovelace is known for translating and annotating a speech by Babbage, where her notes were at least double the size of the original text, which may be intentional.2) This is a graphic novel, but it comes from a web comic so it doesn't have a fully cohesive feel. These are short, episodic stories, but there isn't any sort of overarching plot line.Now, these are two things that I would expect would work against this book, but Padua pulls this all off so charmingly. Here's the story--Charles Babbage is known for designing the first proto-computer, but never actually building one. He struck up a friendship with Ada Lovelace, the daughter of Lord Byron, who learned mathematics from a very young age to try to weaken any ""poetical"" influences from her father (this is a true story). Ada was fascinated by the machine and it's applications, and described how it could be used, including what some consider to be the first computer program. Alas, Lovelace died young and Babbage never built his machine. On a whim, Sydney Padua illustrates this story and ends with a panel wondering what could have been--if Ada lived and Babbage built his machine?This ""What If?"" sends Padua down a deep research hole into the lives of Lovelace and Babbage, and in the end she imagines this alternate (steampunk) universe where a steam computer exists and Lovelace and Babbage get into scrapes and adventures using it. Padua's enthusiasm for the topic and for the friendship between Lovelace and Babbage simply oozes from every page of this book. In the end, this unabashed enthusiasm is what sells the book for me.Many of the footnotes are very funny, comments on sources, on strange things she came across during her research, asides and did you knows about Victorian society (the niche Victorian genre of theological satire using cheese-mites, Uranus originally named George), and an abundance of Victorian lit/math/computer science jokes, with a few cat jokes thrown in for good measure.If you like Kate Beaton's Hark, A Vagrant!, you'll probably like this book. If you're interested in Victoriana or women in STEM or the history of computers or steampunk adventures, you'll probably like this book."
70,0141981539,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43720549-randy-allain,5,"I have never been particularly drawn to the world of graphic novels or web comics, but the premise of mathematical renegades solving problems with a steam-powered Victorian computer convinced me to give this one a try. Sydney Padua's novel starts with a thoughtful biography of Ada King: Countess of Lovelace and daughter of Lord Byron. After explaining that Ada was pushed into mathematics to shelter her from poetry (the “Byron devil”), the book illustrates Ada's affinity for abstract math and her eventual fascination with Charles Babbage's plans for a steam-powered analytical engine. After working extensively with Babbage, obsessively annotating his plans, and writing hypothetical punch-card “programs” for his hypothetical computer, Ada died from cancer at a young age. Babbage never got around to building his analytical engine. Padua was so disappointed in this bitter ending that she constructed a “pocket universe” in which the mathematicians follow-through with their plans to build the engine....hence the, “thrilling adventures.”I would have rated this book a 3 or a 4 based on the comics alone. They were very interesting and the artwork was fantastic – but the comics never quite followed-through with the “thrills” promised in the title. Instead, the thrills came from Padua's impressive empathy for her characters and obsessive research. Not only is her love for the subject matter inspiring, it also provides a great window into the atmosphere of Victorian London. Just about every page of the book is filled with detailed footnotes explaining the historical basis for her characters, jokes, and adventures. All of the information Padua can't fit into the footnotes can be found in extensive endnotes following each adventure and fascinating appendices in which Padua provides her own sketches of the analytical engine (and many of its individual mechanisms) and some of her favorite primary documents. Yes, even the endnotes and appendices have footnotes - and on many occasions the footnotes go meta: they become scattered in explosions, Queen Victoria blocks them out for being too boring, etc. As an English nerd – I couldn't help but give the novel a 5-star rating."

I don't know, honestly. Though the book is highly text heavy, it's easy to skip over the historical notes and footnotes, if you prefer to just read the extremely cute and wonderful comics. Me, I read EVERYTHING. I'm not particularly what one would call a history nut, but if you give me background information on why a comment was actually hilarious given the context or how that line of dialogue actually came from a letter sent by Lovelace to ----- or diagrams of the Analytical Engine or anything really in cute little (and not so little) foot and end notes (and appendixes!!), I will be reading all of them.Some of my favorite panels were from The Client:(All the panels above from The Client are all rough comics and look much nicer and different in the book.)But the whole book is really just lovely and hilarious and absurd and beautiful. And as glad as I am that Padua gave readers a background on Lovelace and Babbage and their real life story, (which is drawn so ADORABLY, even when I was practically wailing at how sad it was), I am infinitely more glad that she wrote a version of their lives set in a Pocket Universe that plays out so much better."
72,0141981539,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7706994-harshit-sahay,5,"This is far from a traditional book or even a traditional graphic novel, at least structurally. Hence reading it like one might not be the wisest thing to do. Originally a webcomic, this is a collection of the Adventures of Charles Babbage and Ada Lovelace, in an alternate universe where they were far more successful than our current one. However, Sydney Padua uses the narrative of the universe as merely an excuse to have fun with the 2 central characters and their often glaring flaws, as well as their genius. This creates some nice comedic plots that involve other figures from that age and time as well. Padua uses footnotes as a mechanism of delving into THE ACTUAL history of this duo, providing us with snippets of information that add dimensions to their characters one doesn't really find in schoolbooks. The footnotes help Padua ground the jokes or punch-lines in the comic to incidents in the actual lives of its protagonists in a manner which is extremely elegant. Indeed, a lot of humour is also derived from self-awareness, especially the bits about the ""2-D Goggles"" and the concept of the Pocket Universe. Non-fiction works that deal with subjects in science often have a fatal flaw- a hand-wavy approach to actual science, and an unnecessary focus on often irrelevant details that just appeal more. Padua circumvents that by establishing a completely imaginary world where her imagination can runaway on fantastical adventures with no constraints on reality. However, to her credit, she delves A LOT into the history of the central characters and the world they inhabited in the form of footnotes and endnotes, which provide the reader with exposition and context for the comic, as well as the actual story. This is both incredibly well researched, and also incredibly funny. One can but appreciate the amount of work Sydney Padua put into this, to be able to quote almost any document mentioning either of the two during their lives. This is the best kind of book, one that teaches you things, and does so in a manner that'll leave you in splits."

There's something irresistible about Lord Byron's daughter having been a brilliant mathematician who wrote the first computer program. If she had lived longer, who knows what else she might have accomplished. I'll read anything about Ada. This book isn't the first alternate history Ada that I've encountered, but it's definitely the most fun conceptually. It's also the first graphic book I've seen with footnotes and endnotes. Some of the notes are as entertaining as the dialogue and captions. Unfortunately, not all of the content was entertaining. I'm not a mathematician. There are sections of this book that got too technical for me. I skimmed them. I did enjoy parts of this book a great deal, but there were others that I considered a snooze fest."

Lovelace & Babbage has appeared previously on the web and (in limited form) in a standalone iPad app, but in this hardcover package it definitely shines. Just from a production standpoint, it stands out; multiple fonts, great layout work, and an incredible cover and dust jacket.Furthermore, there's content in this book that is, I believe, otherwise not available in other formats. I'm not completely sure, but I do not believe I've read the Alice in Wonderland pastiche featured in the final story ""Imaginary Quantities"" anywhere else. Nonetheless it is a standout addition to the L&B canon. In addition, there's some great appendixes with primary source documents (mostly letters from or about Babbage) which sheds some interesting insight into the two protagonists' real lives. There's also a wonderfully illustrated explanation of how the Analytical Engine would look and function.Just about the only thing missing is the major story ""Lovelace & Babbage vs. Organized Crime,"" the eleven part series where our mathematical heroes fight the dastardly plots of organ grinding street performers. But given that that story is probably as long or longer than all the other comics in this work, I can understand why it was left out. Perhaps we'll get a standalone book for that in the future?This collection sits firmly with other fictional-yet-nonfictional works like Logicomix or Action Philosophers. If you're a fan of those books, I genuinely think you'll like this one—and if you liked this one, pick up those other ones! They'll have fewer footnotes, but be just as entertaining and engrossing."

Cartoonist Sydney Padua uses the true story of Charles Babbage and Ada Lovelace as a starting point for her fantastic fictions set in a parallel universe in which the two great thinkers are able to find funding for their magnificent Difference Engine and put it to work in a variety of entertaining and useful ways. Though wildly imaginative, the book is heavily researched and annotated, and you’ll get to see Babbage and Lovelace interact with many familiar names, like Queen Victoria and Charles Dickens, while also learning about some of the era’s less celebrated heroes, such as Isambard Kingdom Brunel.I was fascinated by the story of Babbage and Lovelace, two historical figures I knew next to nothing about, and I particularly enjoyed the detailed footnotes, which filled me in on the historical context of the duo’s adventures. Some of the mathematical equations and scientific theories were a little overwhelming for my English major mind, but Padua presents them in such a playful way that I didn’t feel intimidated. Whether you love science and math or enjoy literature and history, The Thrilling Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage will have something to interest you.- John D.Click here to find the book at the Prince William County Public Library System.

77,0141981539,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5876605-kam-yung-soh,4,"A very entertaining graphic novel about how it might have been if Ada, Countess of Lovelace and Charles Babbage had managed to bring to life the Analytical Engine. The book starts with the real-life stories of Ada and Babbage, then branches off into a 'pocket universe' where the Analytical Engine is created and run by them.In a series of adventures, the pair hilariously show off the Engine to Queen Victoria who wants to 'RULE THE WORLD!', called to save Britain from a global financial crises, fight off the mathematical Luddites, try to mechanise fiction writing by statistically analysing a book by Mary Ann Evans (George Eliot) and even try to visualise the third dimension (remember, the characters live on a two dimensional page).Probably one of the most hilarious short parts of the book is when George Boole (of Boolean logic fame) is reduces to mubbling ""Error, error,"" when asked a non-boolean question (not a ""Yes"" or ""No"" answer) while being served a drink!The book is full of footnotes by the author pointing out historical, mathematical, engineering and computing references to the situations depicted. Making the book more true to life is the effort the author went through to ensure that the words being said in the novel closely match what Ada, Babbage and other characters (like Isambard Kingdom Brunel) actually said or wrote in real life.The book ends with a very technical appendix outlining how Babbage's Analytical Engine would have worked if it actually had been built.A very entertaining read indeed."
78,0141981539,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18850156-stewart-tame,4,"This book was a genuine delight! Inspired by history, Sydney Padua drew a comic strip about Babbage's analytical engine and his relationship with Ada Lovelace. His engine was never built, and Lovelace died young of cancer, so the story doesn't end well. So she added a bit to the end of the strip about how, in another universe, the two went on to build the engine and fight crime. Just a throwaway gag to lighten the mood, make the ending less of a downer. Reaction from the internet was swift, and Padua found herself charged with creating more adventures for her intrepid heroes. And so a legend was born. There's much quirk and charm in this book. There are extensive footnotes, and footnotes to the footnotes--more of these strips are based in fact than might appear at first glance. Don't let the footnotes put you off, though, because there's a breathless enthusiasm to them that makes them a treat to read. Padua is enthusiastic about science and history, and it's contagious. Probably incurable, too. At various times her artwork reminded me of Phil Foglio, Larry Gonick, and even Will Eisner. The footnotes reminded me of Randall Munroe (of xkcd fame.) There's a nice cartoony roundness to her line that makes me smile. This is a marvelous book, particularly if one is a fan of science and/or history and/or steampunk, but even if none of those describe you, you may want to check this book out anyway. Very fun stuff!"
79,0141981539,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63176142-surly,4,"I came across this comic at the Bakken Museum (a small but fun electricity-themed museum in Southwest Minneapolis) and was intrigued by the art, but didn't pick it up, and then checked out a copy from my local library. Now I'm sincerely regretting that I didn't buy it. Padua offers an affectionate portrait of the inventors of the computer (Babbage) and computer programming (Lovelace). While Padua imagines a world where they successfully operate a functioning computer, she bases her flights on a deep reading of the historical record, revealing her principals' personalities and their cultural context in Victorian England. The dialogue is witty and often funny (when not directly borrowed from the principals' correspondence) and supported by legions of footnotes and endnotes that are as entertaining as the images.The art is superb. I loved the character designs and how expressive Padua made them. And she also takes risks with composition, using perspective and page orientation to convey literary and mathematical concepts. For that matter, Padua uses Babbage's original diagrams to sketch out a simplified version of Babbage's unfinished computer, carefully illustrating how processes were accomplished mechanically, offering both visual and written explanations for the reader. It's the rare comic book that engages with both story and an intelligent analysis of the underlying science and history. Highly recommended. "
80,0141981539,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27591228-lapl-reads,4,"Charles Babbage is widely credited with inventing the first computer, depending on your definition of “computer” and “invent”. You see, he never actually finished his masterpiece, the Analytical Engine. Ada Lovelace, the daughter of Lord Byron, was a mathematician who wrote programs for this nascent computer, making her the first computer programmer. Together they were innovators and eccentrics with genuine affection for one another. What could be more fun than a book based on their lives and collaboration? How about a graphic novel based on their story? How about a graphic novel full of extensively researched and annotated science and Victorian history, illustrated with a stylish steampunk flair? The Thrilling Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage is all of this and more. The graphic novel takes their work and lives as a jumping off point and imagines an entire alternate universe where they had the time and means to finish their engine. (In the real world Ada died young and Charles was perpetually trying to pry more money out of the government.) With their analytical engine complete, alternate Lovelace and Babbage can turn to other issues: such as the use of cats in computers, explosions, and fighting crime. This is a fun story, packed full of information, charm, and history.Reviewed by Andrea Borchert, Librarian, Science, Technology & Patents Department"

I also love that the author decided to imagine a world in which Lovelace didn't die tragically young, and then went on to have exciting mathematical and mechanical adventures with Babbage.Where this book loses me is in the detailed explanation and analysis of the mathematics and computer science of the analytical machine. It's a lot to wrap your brain around, and after trying very hard to understand and struggling, I was reminded of the fact that I stopped taking computer science courses in college when it got to this point (the theoretical) and I no longer found it enjoyable. At this point in my reading, I decided I didn't want my difficulty in understanding the mathematics to take away from my enjoyment of the art and story, so I started skimming the sciencey bits. I am, in fact, an adult, and can therefore read and not read whatever I want! :PI would especially recommend this book to someone who enjoys and understands computer science, but it is also entertaining on a more surface level for someone like me, who has an interest in computer things and history, despite their lack of technical knowledge (and lack of desire to obtain said knowledge)."

The art is distinctive and fun, and the main characters (Babbage and Lovelace) are joined by others that appear a few times (Brunel and Wellington), and other famous Victorians; scientists, authors and royals alike.The mixing of history, science and fun is delightful, and each is explored more in depth in its own section. The comics themselves are designed to be funny, while the footnotes and endnotes give more detailed information. The first appendix is a compilation of the author's favourite primary sources about Babbage and Lovelace. The second appendix is an explanation of the never built Analytical Machine, complete with diagrams to provide a clear view of the components and working of the machine.Overall this is a fun book that should appeal to those interested in Babbage and Lovelace, who may also enjoy learning about the Analytical Engine."

When that book also illuminates my knowledge of important historical (feminist) figures I've only read snippets about elsewhere, it scores more points. When it does so through a comic book form that employs a pocket universe that loops back on itself (both theoretically and narratively) and employs many of the technological wonders and famous figures of nineteenth century Britain in so doing, I marvel at this gem of a unique book that piques so many of my interests that I may need a difference engine to calculate the figure.

96,0141981539,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8590635-chad,5,"TL;DR Summary: I found this book amazing, inspiring, and perhaps a little magnificent. Having read it, and the author's commentary, it's easy for me to understand how the author found the subject of Ada Lovelace's life so captivating. The remainder of this review is a description of how, and why, it had such a significant impact on me when I read it.For more than a quarter century, I recall thinking at almost all times that I disliked math. I then encountered a math teacher in college, Dr. Blaga Pauley, whose engaging and philosophical teaching style -- which felt more like a conversation about what was most intriguing about math than like formal education -- helped me realize that what I disliked so strongly was not math itself, but the way people seem to think it must be dictated and drilled. Math is, in fact, a beautiful realm of brilliant insights, elegant systems, intricate designs, and the power to create new understanding.I was not (within myself) ready to carry on with math as a more significant pursuit on my own, yet, and a variety of circumstances conspired to keep me from getting the kind of mentorship I needed to reach that readiness. It is difficult to break free from decades of being indoctrinated in the belief that mathematics is a bureaucratic, dreary, tedious field of academic irrelevance, and other (more comfortable, at the time) interests easily distracted me from taking my education in math any further than strictly necessary for all the interests I pursued instead. Even so, the ideas around math as presented by Blaga (before she passed away) stuck with me, and led me to collect a few books for later reading -- a ""later"" that, until now, never came.Along the way, I heard of this book, and someone gave it to me as a gift. Perhaps it was because I asked for it; I don't recall. Time passed, and this year (2019) I finally picked it up and read it. Reading this awoke in me a greater interest in the real-world intellectual adventures of the Countess of Lovelace (the evident originator of general-purpose programming as a field of study and perhaps even the foundation-layer of computer science) and Charles Babbage (the inventor of the Analytical Engine). More significantly for me, perhaps, is the fact this book is what seems to have finally pushed me over the precipice into a plunge into the depths of desire to really learn more about (and seek fuller understanding of) mathematics as a field of exploration rather than simple study. This book has changed my mindset again, like Blaga's instruction did almost twenty years ago, and I rather suspect that when I think back on this in a few years I will be able to say that those two events together have conspired to change my life.I do not know whether this book can help change anyone else's life for the better, but I recommend it without reservation to anyone considering whether it is worth reading. If you hesitated to dedicate time to it before reading this review, hesitate no longer. It really was an amazing experience for me, and I hope it will be for you, too."
97,0141981539,http://goodreads.com/user/show/772327-christopher,4,"Oh my was this fun! I enjoyed the heck out of this book. My daughter enjoyed the heck out of this book. It's clear the author enjoyed the heck out of this book.So the book starts with a historical account of Charles Babbage, Ada Lovelace, and the Difference Engine (and it's progeny the Analytical Engine) - presented in an entertaining storytelling style, complete with footnotes and endnotes - (akin to the Cartoon History of the Universe I, Vol. 1-7: From the Big Bang to Alexander the Great). So far, so good. But this section ends quickly and on a down-note with Lovelace dead of cancer and Babbage unable to get over himself to actually build any of his designs.But as we have seen in so much alternate history from The Difference Engine to Fiddlehead, the idea of a Victorian-era steam-and-cogs computer is just too good to let facts reign and history to have the last say. So Sydney Padua transports us to a pocket universe where the laws of physics are set to maximize entertainment value and the book roars onward, now looking increasingly like Girl Genius, Vol. 1: Agatha Heterodyne and the Beetleburg Clank only with a historically accurate cast of characters instead of a fictional one (well except for Minion the Footman).Oh, and the footnotes continue. Almost every statement uttered by Lovelace, Babbage, or various supporting characters in the book is straight from their own writings or supported with primary documents. And the supporting cast is broad from the Duke of Wellington, to Islambard Kingdom Brunel, to George Eliot, to Lewis Carroll/Charles Dodgson, to Queen Victoria herself. Eventually the footnotes themselves become a character in a Wonderland-inspired investigation into the truth of Ada Lovelace's character and contribution to the Analytical Engine and computer science as a field.And throughout this all, as we watch these absurd Victorian characters and learn about the design of the Analytical Engine and the logic of computing, there's another story being told. The author is able to show us so much about Babbage and Lovelace's personalities and victories because of the triumph of computing. The Google Books project and others like it have opened the world of historical primary sources to interested amateurs like Padua in a way that really has never been possible before. The author is able to wade into decades-old debates with a sharp pen and over-looked sources because of the work of Babbage and Lovelace's intellectual progeny who have continued the drive to organize, collate, and analyze the world's knowledge."
98,0141981539,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27837035-heather-jones,5,"This is a delightfully informative and madcap graphic biography (sort-of) of Ada Lovelace and her relationship with proto-computer inventor Charles Babbage and his research. I found it reminiscent of such genre-fracturing works as Larry Gonick’s The Cartoon History of… series or Scott McCloud’s Understanding Comics in the way it simultaneously uses and subverts the conventions of graphic storytelling to bridge the worlds of education and entertainment. (No doubt there are many other works that do similar things, but I don't actually follow graphic novels much, so these are the ones I thought of.)It begins as a straightforward biography of Augusta Ada King, Countess Lovelace, daughter of the mad poet Lord Byron, and very arguably the first computer programmer. The visual storytelling is expanded by the use of footnotes (which often interact amusingly with the other graphic elements) and extensive endnotes that expand on technical points, or issues and personages contemporary to the main themes. (I read it in iBooks format and the e-text has been set up to allow easy movement between the main panels, the endnotes, and large-text versions of both foot- and endnotes.)But the author, having to her dismay hit the limits of pure biography, due to Lovelace’s tragically short life and Babbage’s failure to actually realize any of his amazing inventions, plunges on sideways into an alternate steampunk universe in which Lovelace and Babbage actually build the analytical engine and use it to…wait for it…fight crime! (And other adventurous pursuits.) Here the story explodes into a mash-up of actual history, deranged tour through the political and literary landscape of mid-19th century Britain, and technical manual.I loved how the story returned to the essentials of steampunk as a genre (as opposed to an artistic aesthetic) in highlighting the exploits of larger-than-life 19th century figures whose dreams and inventive imaginations outstripped the technology of the day. It does not, however, ignore the aesthetic side of steampunk, and aficionados will find all their favorite goggles, Rube-Goldbergian technology, and dashing women in gender-bending historic clothing.Whether you read the central graphic story purely as entertainment, or delve deeply enough into the technical appendices to understand just how Babbage’s engine was intended to work (and the reasons why it was unlikely to have done so), or split the difference by meditating on the ways in which a brilliant mind like Lovelace’s was betrayed and undermined by the age she lived in, this is a book I recommend in the strongest terms."
99,0141981539,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5033966-kaia,5,"First things first, let's get some assumptions out of the way. 1) This book has a lot of footnotes and endnotes. I did not count, but there may be more footnotes/endnotes than actual graphic content. That being said, they are absolutely charming footnotes that I loved reading. Granted, the historical Lovelace is known for translating and annotating a speech by Babbage, where her notes were at least double the size of the original text, which may be intentional.2) This is a graphic novel, but it comes from a web comic so it doesn't have a fully cohesive feel. These are short, episodic stories, but there isn't any sort of overarching plot line.Now, these are two things that I would expect would work against this book, but Padua pulls this all off so charmingly. Here's the story--Charles Babbage is known for designing the first proto-computer, but never actually building one. He struck up a friendship with Ada Lovelace, the daughter of Lord Byron, who learned mathematics from a very young age to try to weaken any ""poetical"" influences from her father (this is a true story). Ada was fascinated by the machine and it's applications, and described how it could be used, including what some consider to be the first computer program. Alas, Lovelace died young and Babbage never built his machine. On a whim, Sydney Padua illustrates this story and ends with a panel wondering what could have been--if Ada lived and Babbage built his machine?This ""What If?"" sends Padua down a deep research hole into the lives of Lovelace and Babbage, and in the end she imagines this alternate (steampunk) universe where a steam computer exists and Lovelace and Babbage get into scrapes and adventures using it. Padua's enthusiasm for the topic and for the friendship between Lovelace and Babbage simply oozes from every page of this book. In the end, this unabashed enthusiasm is what sells the book for me.Many of the footnotes are very funny, comments on sources, on strange things she came across during her research, asides and did you knows about Victorian society (the niche Victorian genre of theological satire using cheese-mites, Uranus originally named George), and an abundance of Victorian lit/math/computer science jokes, with a few cat jokes thrown in for good measure.If you like Kate Beaton's Hark, A Vagrant!, you'll probably like this book. If you're interested in Victoriana or women in STEM or the history of computers or steampunk adventures, you'll probably like this book."
100,0141981539,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43720549-randy-allain,5,"I have never been particularly drawn to the world of graphic novels or web comics, but the premise of mathematical renegades solving problems with a steam-powered Victorian computer convinced me to give this one a try. Sydney Padua's novel starts with a thoughtful biography of Ada King: Countess of Lovelace and daughter of Lord Byron. After explaining that Ada was pushed into mathematics to shelter her from poetry (the “Byron devil”), the book illustrates Ada's affinity for abstract math and her eventual fascination with Charles Babbage's plans for a steam-powered analytical engine. After working extensively with Babbage, obsessively annotating his plans, and writing hypothetical punch-card “programs” for his hypothetical computer, Ada died from cancer at a young age. Babbage never got around to building his analytical engine. Padua was so disappointed in this bitter ending that she constructed a “pocket universe” in which the mathematicians follow-through with their plans to build the engine....hence the, “thrilling adventures.”I would have rated this book a 3 or a 4 based on the comics alone. They were very interesting and the artwork was fantastic – but the comics never quite followed-through with the “thrills” promised in the title. Instead, the thrills came from Padua's impressive empathy for her characters and obsessive research. Not only is her love for the subject matter inspiring, it also provides a great window into the atmosphere of Victorian London. Just about every page of the book is filled with detailed footnotes explaining the historical basis for her characters, jokes, and adventures. All of the information Padua can't fit into the footnotes can be found in extensive endnotes following each adventure and fascinating appendices in which Padua provides her own sketches of the analytical engine (and many of its individual mechanisms) and some of her favorite primary documents. Yes, even the endnotes and appendices have footnotes - and on many occasions the footnotes go meta: they become scattered in explosions, Queen Victoria blocks them out for being too boring, etc. As an English nerd – I couldn't help but give the novel a 5-star rating."

I don't know, honestly. Though the book is highly text heavy, it's easy to skip over the historical notes and footnotes, if you prefer to just read the extremely cute and wonderful comics. Me, I read EVERYTHING. I'm not particularly what one would call a history nut, but if you give me background information on why a comment was actually hilarious given the context or how that line of dialogue actually came from a letter sent by Lovelace to ----- or diagrams of the Analytical Engine or anything really in cute little (and not so little) foot and end notes (and appendixes!!), I will be reading all of them.Some of my favorite panels were from The Client:(All the panels above from The Client are all rough comics and look much nicer and different in the book.)But the whole book is really just lovely and hilarious and absurd and beautiful. And as glad as I am that Padua gave readers a background on Lovelace and Babbage and their real life story, (which is drawn so ADORABLY, even when I was practically wailing at how sad it was), I am infinitely more glad that she wrote a version of their lives set in a Pocket Universe that plays out so much better."
102,0141981539,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7706994-harshit-sahay,5,"This is far from a traditional book or even a traditional graphic novel, at least structurally. Hence reading it like one might not be the wisest thing to do. Originally a webcomic, this is a collection of the Adventures of Charles Babbage and Ada Lovelace, in an alternate universe where they were far more successful than our current one. However, Sydney Padua uses the narrative of the universe as merely an excuse to have fun with the 2 central characters and their often glaring flaws, as well as their genius. This creates some nice comedic plots that involve other figures from that age and time as well. Padua uses footnotes as a mechanism of delving into THE ACTUAL history of this duo, providing us with snippets of information that add dimensions to their characters one doesn't really find in schoolbooks. The footnotes help Padua ground the jokes or punch-lines in the comic to incidents in the actual lives of its protagonists in a manner which is extremely elegant. Indeed, a lot of humour is also derived from self-awareness, especially the bits about the ""2-D Goggles"" and the concept of the Pocket Universe. Non-fiction works that deal with subjects in science often have a fatal flaw- a hand-wavy approach to actual science, and an unnecessary focus on often irrelevant details that just appeal more. Padua circumvents that by establishing a completely imaginary world where her imagination can runaway on fantastical adventures with no constraints on reality. However, to her credit, she delves A LOT into the history of the central characters and the world they inhabited in the form of footnotes and endnotes, which provide the reader with exposition and context for the comic, as well as the actual story. This is both incredibly well researched, and also incredibly funny. One can but appreciate the amount of work Sydney Padua put into this, to be able to quote almost any document mentioning either of the two during their lives. This is the best kind of book, one that teaches you things, and does so in a manner that'll leave you in splits."

There's something irresistible about Lord Byron's daughter having been a brilliant mathematician who wrote the first computer program. If she had lived longer, who knows what else she might have accomplished. I'll read anything about Ada. This book isn't the first alternate history Ada that I've encountered, but it's definitely the most fun conceptually. It's also the first graphic book I've seen with footnotes and endnotes. Some of the notes are as entertaining as the dialogue and captions. Unfortunately, not all of the content was entertaining. I'm not a mathematician. There are sections of this book that got too technical for me. I skimmed them. I did enjoy parts of this book a great deal, but there were others that I considered a snooze fest."

Lovelace & Babbage has appeared previously on the web and (in limited form) in a standalone iPad app, but in this hardcover package it definitely shines. Just from a production standpoint, it stands out; multiple fonts, great layout work, and an incredible cover and dust jacket.Furthermore, there's content in this book that is, I believe, otherwise not available in other formats. I'm not completely sure, but I do not believe I've read the Alice in Wonderland pastiche featured in the final story ""Imaginary Quantities"" anywhere else. Nonetheless it is a standout addition to the L&B canon. In addition, there's some great appendixes with primary source documents (mostly letters from or about Babbage) which sheds some interesting insight into the two protagonists' real lives. There's also a wonderfully illustrated explanation of how the Analytical Engine would look and function.Just about the only thing missing is the major story ""Lovelace & Babbage vs. Organized Crime,"" the eleven part series where our mathematical heroes fight the dastardly plots of organ grinding street performers. But given that that story is probably as long or longer than all the other comics in this work, I can understand why it was left out. Perhaps we'll get a standalone book for that in the future?This collection sits firmly with other fictional-yet-nonfictional works like Logicomix or Action Philosophers. If you're a fan of those books, I genuinely think you'll like this one—and if you liked this one, pick up those other ones! They'll have fewer footnotes, but be just as entertaining and engrossing."

Cartoonist Sydney Padua uses the true story of Charles Babbage and Ada Lovelace as a starting point for her fantastic fictions set in a parallel universe in which the two great thinkers are able to find funding for their magnificent Difference Engine and put it to work in a variety of entertaining and useful ways. Though wildly imaginative, the book is heavily researched and annotated, and you’ll get to see Babbage and Lovelace interact with many familiar names, like Queen Victoria and Charles Dickens, while also learning about some of the era’s less celebrated heroes, such as Isambard Kingdom Brunel.I was fascinated by the story of Babbage and Lovelace, two historical figures I knew next to nothing about, and I particularly enjoyed the detailed footnotes, which filled me in on the historical context of the duo’s adventures. Some of the mathematical equations and scientific theories were a little overwhelming for my English major mind, but Padua presents them in such a playful way that I didn’t feel intimidated. Whether you love science and math or enjoy literature and history, The Thrilling Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage will have something to interest you.- John D.Click here to find the book at the Prince William County Public Library System.

107,0141981539,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5876605-kam-yung-soh,4,"A very entertaining graphic novel about how it might have been if Ada, Countess of Lovelace and Charles Babbage had managed to bring to life the Analytical Engine. The book starts with the real-life stories of Ada and Babbage, then branches off into a 'pocket universe' where the Analytical Engine is created and run by them.In a series of adventures, the pair hilariously show off the Engine to Queen Victoria who wants to 'RULE THE WORLD!', called to save Britain from a global financial crises, fight off the mathematical Luddites, try to mechanise fiction writing by statistically analysing a book by Mary Ann Evans (George Eliot) and even try to visualise the third dimension (remember, the characters live on a two dimensional page).Probably one of the most hilarious short parts of the book is when George Boole (of Boolean logic fame) is reduces to mubbling ""Error, error,"" when asked a non-boolean question (not a ""Yes"" or ""No"" answer) while being served a drink!The book is full of footnotes by the author pointing out historical, mathematical, engineering and computing references to the situations depicted. Making the book more true to life is the effort the author went through to ensure that the words being said in the novel closely match what Ada, Babbage and other characters (like Isambard Kingdom Brunel) actually said or wrote in real life.The book ends with a very technical appendix outlining how Babbage's Analytical Engine would have worked if it actually had been built.A very entertaining read indeed."
108,0141981539,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18850156-stewart-tame,4,"This book was a genuine delight! Inspired by history, Sydney Padua drew a comic strip about Babbage's analytical engine and his relationship with Ada Lovelace. His engine was never built, and Lovelace died young of cancer, so the story doesn't end well. So she added a bit to the end of the strip about how, in another universe, the two went on to build the engine and fight crime. Just a throwaway gag to lighten the mood, make the ending less of a downer. Reaction from the internet was swift, and Padua found herself charged with creating more adventures for her intrepid heroes. And so a legend was born. There's much quirk and charm in this book. There are extensive footnotes, and footnotes to the footnotes--more of these strips are based in fact than might appear at first glance. Don't let the footnotes put you off, though, because there's a breathless enthusiasm to them that makes them a treat to read. Padua is enthusiastic about science and history, and it's contagious. Probably incurable, too. At various times her artwork reminded me of Phil Foglio, Larry Gonick, and even Will Eisner. The footnotes reminded me of Randall Munroe (of xkcd fame.) There's a nice cartoony roundness to her line that makes me smile. This is a marvelous book, particularly if one is a fan of science and/or history and/or steampunk, but even if none of those describe you, you may want to check this book out anyway. Very fun stuff!"

Now I'm sincerely regretting that I didn't buy it. Padua offers an affectionate portrait of the inventors of the computer (Babbage) and computer programming (Lovelace). While Padua imagines a world where they successfully operate a functioning computer, she bases her flights on a deep reading of the historical record, revealing her principals' personalities and their cultural context in Victorian England. The dialogue is witty and often funny (when not directly borrowed from the principals' correspondence) and supported by legions of footnotes and endnotes that are as entertaining as the images.The art is superb. I loved the character designs and how expressive Padua made them. And she also takes risks with composition, using perspective and page orientation to convey literary and mathematical concepts. For that matter, Padua uses Babbage's original diagrams to sketch out a simplified version of Babbage's unfinished computer, carefully illustrating how processes were accomplished mechanically, offering both visual and written explanations for the reader. It's the rare comic book that engages with both story and an intelligent analysis of the underlying science and history. Highly recommended. "
110,0141981539,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27591228-lapl-reads,4,"Charles Babbage is widely credited with inventing the first computer, depending on your definition of “computer” and “invent”. You see, he never actually finished his masterpiece, the Analytical Engine. Ada Lovelace, the daughter of Lord Byron, was a mathematician who wrote programs for this nascent computer, making her the first computer programmer. Together they were innovators and eccentrics with genuine affection for one another. What could be more fun than a book based on their lives and collaboration? How about a graphic novel based on their story? How about a graphic novel full of extensively researched and annotated science and Victorian history, illustrated with a stylish steampunk flair? The Thrilling Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage is all of this and more. The graphic novel takes their work and lives as a jumping off point and imagines an entire alternate universe where they had the time and means to finish their engine. (In the real world Ada died young and Charles was perpetually trying to pry more money out of the government.) With their analytical engine complete, alternate Lovelace and Babbage can turn to other issues: such as the use of cats in computers, explosions, and fighting crime. This is a fun story, packed full of information, charm, and history.Reviewed by Andrea Borchert, Librarian, Science, Technology & Patents Department"

I also love that the author decided to imagine a world in which Lovelace didn't die tragically young, and then went on to have exciting mathematical and mechanical adventures with Babbage.Where this book loses me is in the detailed explanation and analysis of the mathematics and computer science of the analytical machine. It's a lot to wrap your brain around, and after trying very hard to understand and struggling, I was reminded of the fact that I stopped taking computer science courses in college when it got to this point (the theoretical) and I no longer found it enjoyable. At this point in my reading, I decided I didn't want my difficulty in understanding the mathematics to take away from my enjoyment of the art and story, so I started skimming the sciencey bits. I am, in fact, an adult, and can therefore read and not read whatever I want! :PI would especially recommend this book to someone who enjoys and understands computer science, but it is also entertaining on a more surface level for someone like me, who has an interest in computer things and history, despite their lack of technical knowledge (and lack of desire to obtain said knowledge)."

The art is distinctive and fun, and the main characters (Babbage and Lovelace) are joined by others that appear a few times (Brunel and Wellington), and other famous Victorians; scientists, authors and royals alike.The mixing of history, science and fun is delightful, and each is explored more in depth in its own section. The comics themselves are designed to be funny, while the footnotes and endnotes give more detailed information. The first appendix is a compilation of the author's favourite primary sources about Babbage and Lovelace. The second appendix is an explanation of the never built Analytical Machine, complete with diagrams to provide a clear view of the components and working of the machine.Overall this is a fun book that should appeal to those interested in Babbage and Lovelace, who may also enjoy learning about the Analytical Engine."

When that book also illuminates my knowledge of important historical (feminist) figures I've only read snippets about elsewhere, it scores more points. When it does so through a comic book form that employs a pocket universe that loops back on itself (both theoretically and narratively) and employs many of the technological wonders and famous figures of nineteenth century Britain in so doing, I marvel at this gem of a unique book that piques so many of my interests that I may need a difference engine to calculate the figure.

126,0141981539,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8590635-chad,5,"TL;DR Summary: I found this book amazing, inspiring, and perhaps a little magnificent. Having read it, and the author's commentary, it's easy for me to understand how the author found the subject of Ada Lovelace's life so captivating. The remainder of this review is a description of how, and why, it had such a significant impact on me when I read it.For more than a quarter century, I recall thinking at almost all times that I disliked math. I then encountered a math teacher in college, Dr. Blaga Pauley, whose engaging and philosophical teaching style -- which felt more like a conversation about what was most intriguing about math than like formal education -- helped me realize that what I disliked so strongly was not math itself, but the way people seem to think it must be dictated and drilled. Math is, in fact, a beautiful realm of brilliant insights, elegant systems, intricate designs, and the power to create new understanding.I was not (within myself) ready to carry on with math as a more significant pursuit on my own, yet, and a variety of circumstances conspired to keep me from getting the kind of mentorship I needed to reach that readiness. It is difficult to break free from decades of being indoctrinated in the belief that mathematics is a bureaucratic, dreary, tedious field of academic irrelevance, and other (more comfortable, at the time) interests easily distracted me from taking my education in math any further than strictly necessary for all the interests I pursued instead. Even so, the ideas around math as presented by Blaga (before she passed away) stuck with me, and led me to collect a few books for later reading -- a ""later"" that, until now, never came.Along the way, I heard of this book, and someone gave it to me as a gift. Perhaps it was because I asked for it; I don't recall. Time passed, and this year (2019) I finally picked it up and read it. Reading this awoke in me a greater interest in the real-world intellectual adventures of the Countess of Lovelace (the evident originator of general-purpose programming as a field of study and perhaps even the foundation-layer of computer science) and Charles Babbage (the inventor of the Analytical Engine). More significantly for me, perhaps, is the fact this book is what seems to have finally pushed me over the precipice into a plunge into the depths of desire to really learn more about (and seek fuller understanding of) mathematics as a field of exploration rather than simple study. This book has changed my mindset again, like Blaga's instruction did almost twenty years ago, and I rather suspect that when I think back on this in a few years I will be able to say that those two events together have conspired to change my life.I do not know whether this book can help change anyone else's life for the better, but I recommend it without reservation to anyone considering whether it is worth reading. If you hesitated to dedicate time to it before reading this review, hesitate no longer. It really was an amazing experience for me, and I hope it will be for you, too."
127,0141981539,http://goodreads.com/user/show/772327-christopher,4,"Oh my was this fun! I enjoyed the heck out of this book. My daughter enjoyed the heck out of this book. It's clear the author enjoyed the heck out of this book.So the book starts with a historical account of Charles Babbage, Ada Lovelace, and the Difference Engine (and it's progeny the Analytical Engine) - presented in an entertaining storytelling style, complete with footnotes and endnotes - (akin to the Cartoon History of the Universe I, Vol. 1-7: From the Big Bang to Alexander the Great). So far, so good. But this section ends quickly and on a down-note with Lovelace dead of cancer and Babbage unable to get over himself to actually build any of his designs.But as we have seen in so much alternate history from The Difference Engine to Fiddlehead, the idea of a Victorian-era steam-and-cogs computer is just too good to let facts reign and history to have the last say. So Sydney Padua transports us to a pocket universe where the laws of physics are set to maximize entertainment value and the book roars onward, now looking increasingly like Girl Genius, Vol. 1: Agatha Heterodyne and the Beetleburg Clank only with a historically accurate cast of characters instead of a fictional one (well except for Minion the Footman).Oh, and the footnotes continue. Almost every statement uttered by Lovelace, Babbage, or various supporting characters in the book is straight from their own writings or supported with primary documents. And the supporting cast is broad from the Duke of Wellington, to Islambard Kingdom Brunel, to George Eliot, to Lewis Carroll/Charles Dodgson, to Queen Victoria herself. Eventually the footnotes themselves become a character in a Wonderland-inspired investigation into the truth of Ada Lovelace's character and contribution to the Analytical Engine and computer science as a field.And throughout this all, as we watch these absurd Victorian characters and learn about the design of the Analytical Engine and the logic of computing, there's another story being told. The author is able to show us so much about Babbage and Lovelace's personalities and victories because of the triumph of computing. The Google Books project and others like it have opened the world of historical primary sources to interested amateurs like Padua in a way that really has never been possible before. The author is able to wade into decades-old debates with a sharp pen and over-looked sources because of the work of Babbage and Lovelace's intellectual progeny who have continued the drive to organize, collate, and analyze the world's knowledge."

I found it reminiscent of such genre-fracturing works as Larry Gonick’s The Cartoon History of… series or Scott McCloud’s Understanding Comics in the way it simultaneously uses and subverts the conventions of graphic storytelling to bridge the worlds of education and entertainment. (No doubt there are many other works that do similar things, but I don't actually follow graphic novels much, so these are the ones I thought of.)It begins as a straightforward biography of Augusta Ada King, Countess Lovelace, daughter of the mad poet Lord Byron, and very arguably the first computer programmer. The visual storytelling is expanded by the use of footnotes (which often interact amusingly with the other graphic elements) and extensive endnotes that expand on technical points, or issues and personages contemporary to the main themes. (I read it in iBooks format and the e-text has been set up to allow easy movement between the main panels, the endnotes, and large-text versions of both foot- and endnotes.)But the author, having to her dismay hit the limits of pure biography, due to Lovelace’s tragically short life and Babbage’s failure to actually realize any of his amazing inventions, plunges on sideways into an alternate steampunk universe in which Lovelace and Babbage actually build the analytical engine and use it to…wait for it…fight crime! (And other adventurous pursuits.) Here the story explodes into a mash-up of actual history, deranged tour through the political and literary landscape of mid-19th century Britain, and technical manual.I loved how the story returned to the essentials of steampunk as a genre (as opposed to an artistic aesthetic) in highlighting the exploits of larger-than-life 19th century figures whose dreams and inventive imaginations outstripped the technology of the day. It does not, however, ignore the aesthetic side of steampunk, and aficionados will find all their favorite goggles, Rube-Goldbergian technology, and dashing women in gender-bending historic clothing.Whether you read the central graphic story purely as entertainment, or delve deeply enough into the technical appendices to understand just how Babbage’s engine was intended to work (and the reasons why it was unlikely to have done so), or split the difference by meditating on the ways in which a brilliant mind like Lovelace’s was betrayed and undermined by the age she lived in, this is a book I recommend in the strongest terms."
129,0141981539,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5033966-kaia,5,"First things first, let's get some assumptions out of the way. 1) This book has a lot of footnotes and endnotes. I did not count, but there may be more footnotes/endnotes than actual graphic content. That being said, they are absolutely charming footnotes that I loved reading. Granted, the historical Lovelace is known for translating and annotating a speech by Babbage, where her notes were at least double the size of the original text, which may be intentional.2) This is a graphic novel, but it comes from a web comic so it doesn't have a fully cohesive feel. These are short, episodic stories, but there isn't any sort of overarching plot line.Now, these are two things that I would expect would work against this book, but Padua pulls this all off so charmingly. Here's the story--Charles Babbage is known for designing the first proto-computer, but never actually building one. He struck up a friendship with Ada Lovelace, the daughter of Lord Byron, who learned mathematics from a very young age to try to weaken any ""poetical"" influences from her father (this is a true story). Ada was fascinated by the machine and it's applications, and described how it could be used, including what some consider to be the first computer program. Alas, Lovelace died young and Babbage never built his machine. On a whim, Sydney Padua illustrates this story and ends with a panel wondering what could have been--if Ada lived and Babbage built his machine?This ""What If?"" sends Padua down a deep research hole into the lives of Lovelace and Babbage, and in the end she imagines this alternate (steampunk) universe where a steam computer exists and Lovelace and Babbage get into scrapes and adventures using it. Padua's enthusiasm for the topic and for the friendship between Lovelace and Babbage simply oozes from every page of this book. In the end, this unabashed enthusiasm is what sells the book for me.Many of the footnotes are very funny, comments on sources, on strange things she came across during her research, asides and did you knows about Victorian society (the niche Victorian genre of theological satire using cheese-mites, Uranus originally named George), and an abundance of Victorian lit/math/computer science jokes, with a few cat jokes thrown in for good measure.If you like Kate Beaton's Hark, A Vagrant!, you'll probably like this book. If you're interested in Victoriana or women in STEM or the history of computers or steampunk adventures, you'll probably like this book."
130,0141981539,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43720549-randy-allain,5,"I have never been particularly drawn to the world of graphic novels or web comics, but the premise of mathematical renegades solving problems with a steam-powered Victorian computer convinced me to give this one a try. Sydney Padua's novel starts with a thoughtful biography of Ada King: Countess of Lovelace and daughter of Lord Byron. After explaining that Ada was pushed into mathematics to shelter her from poetry (the “Byron devil”), the book illustrates Ada's affinity for abstract math and her eventual fascination with Charles Babbage's plans for a steam-powered analytical engine. After working extensively with Babbage, obsessively annotating his plans, and writing hypothetical punch-card “programs” for his hypothetical computer, Ada died from cancer at a young age. Babbage never got around to building his analytical engine. Padua was so disappointed in this bitter ending that she constructed a “pocket universe” in which the mathematicians follow-through with their plans to build the engine....hence the, “thrilling adventures.”I would have rated this book a 3 or a 4 based on the comics alone. They were very interesting and the artwork was fantastic – but the comics never quite followed-through with the “thrills” promised in the title. Instead, the thrills came from Padua's impressive empathy for her characters and obsessive research. Not only is her love for the subject matter inspiring, it also provides a great window into the atmosphere of Victorian London. Just about every page of the book is filled with detailed footnotes explaining the historical basis for her characters, jokes, and adventures. All of the information Padua can't fit into the footnotes can be found in extensive endnotes following each adventure and fascinating appendices in which Padua provides her own sketches of the analytical engine (and many of its individual mechanisms) and some of her favorite primary documents. Yes, even the endnotes and appendices have footnotes - and on many occasions the footnotes go meta: they become scattered in explosions, Queen Victoria blocks them out for being too boring, etc. As an English nerd – I couldn't help but give the novel a 5-star rating."

I don't know, honestly. Though the book is highly text heavy, it's easy to skip over the historical notes and footnotes, if you prefer to just read the extremely cute and wonderful comics. Me, I read EVERYTHING. I'm not particularly what one would call a history nut, but if you give me background information on why a comment was actually hilarious given the context or how that line of dialogue actually came from a letter sent by Lovelace to ----- or diagrams of the Analytical Engine or anything really in cute little (and not so little) foot and end notes (and appendixes!!), I will be reading all of them.Some of my favorite panels were from The Client:(All the panels above from The Client are all rough comics and look much nicer and different in the book.)But the whole book is really just lovely and hilarious and absurd and beautiful. And as glad as I am that Padua gave readers a background on Lovelace and Babbage and their real life story, (which is drawn so ADORABLY, even when I was practically wailing at how sad it was), I am infinitely more glad that she wrote a version of their lives set in a Pocket Universe that plays out so much better."
132,0141981539,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7706994-harshit-sahay,5,"This is far from a traditional book or even a traditional graphic novel, at least structurally. Hence reading it like one might not be the wisest thing to do. Originally a webcomic, this is a collection of the Adventures of Charles Babbage and Ada Lovelace, in an alternate universe where they were far more successful than our current one. However, Sydney Padua uses the narrative of the universe as merely an excuse to have fun with the 2 central characters and their often glaring flaws, as well as their genius. This creates some nice comedic plots that involve other figures from that age and time as well. Padua uses footnotes as a mechanism of delving into THE ACTUAL history of this duo, providing us with snippets of information that add dimensions to their characters one doesn't really find in schoolbooks. The footnotes help Padua ground the jokes or punch-lines in the comic to incidents in the actual lives of its protagonists in a manner which is extremely elegant. Indeed, a lot of humour is also derived from self-awareness, especially the bits about the ""2-D Goggles"" and the concept of the Pocket Universe. Non-fiction works that deal with subjects in science often have a fatal flaw- a hand-wavy approach to actual science, and an unnecessary focus on often irrelevant details that just appeal more. Padua circumvents that by establishing a completely imaginary world where her imagination can runaway on fantastical adventures with no constraints on reality. However, to her credit, she delves A LOT into the history of the central characters and the world they inhabited in the form of footnotes and endnotes, which provide the reader with exposition and context for the comic, as well as the actual story. This is both incredibly well researched, and also incredibly funny. One can but appreciate the amount of work Sydney Padua put into this, to be able to quote almost any document mentioning either of the two during their lives. This is the best kind of book, one that teaches you things, and does so in a manner that'll leave you in splits."

There's something irresistible about Lord Byron's daughter having been a brilliant mathematician who wrote the first computer program. If she had lived longer, who knows what else she might have accomplished. I'll read anything about Ada. This book isn't the first alternate history Ada that I've encountered, but it's definitely the most fun conceptually. It's also the first graphic book I've seen with footnotes and endnotes. Some of the notes are as entertaining as the dialogue and captions. Unfortunately, not all of the content was entertaining. I'm not a mathematician. There are sections of this book that got too technical for me. I skimmed them. I did enjoy parts of this book a great deal, but there were others that I considered a snooze fest."

Lovelace & Babbage has appeared previously on the web and (in limited form) in a standalone iPad app, but in this hardcover package it definitely shines. Just from a production standpoint, it stands out; multiple fonts, great layout work, and an incredible cover and dust jacket.Furthermore, there's content in this book that is, I believe, otherwise not available in other formats. I'm not completely sure, but I do not believe I've read the Alice in Wonderland pastiche featured in the final story ""Imaginary Quantities"" anywhere else. Nonetheless it is a standout addition to the L&B canon. In addition, there's some great appendixes with primary source documents (mostly letters from or about Babbage) which sheds some interesting insight into the two protagonists' real lives. There's also a wonderfully illustrated explanation of how the Analytical Engine would look and function.Just about the only thing missing is the major story ""Lovelace & Babbage vs. Organized Crime,"" the eleven part series where our mathematical heroes fight the dastardly plots of organ grinding street performers. But given that that story is probably as long or longer than all the other comics in this work, I can understand why it was left out. Perhaps we'll get a standalone book for that in the future?This collection sits firmly with other fictional-yet-nonfictional works like Logicomix or Action Philosophers. If you're a fan of those books, I genuinely think you'll like this one—and if you liked this one, pick up those other ones! They'll have fewer footnotes, but be just as entertaining and engrossing."

Cartoonist Sydney Padua uses the true story of Charles Babbage and Ada Lovelace as a starting point for her fantastic fictions set in a parallel universe in which the two great thinkers are able to find funding for their magnificent Difference Engine and put it to work in a variety of entertaining and useful ways. Though wildly imaginative, the book is heavily researched and annotated, and you’ll get to see Babbage and Lovelace interact with many familiar names, like Queen Victoria and Charles Dickens, while also learning about some of the era’s less celebrated heroes, such as Isambard Kingdom Brunel.I was fascinated by the story of Babbage and Lovelace, two historical figures I knew next to nothing about, and I particularly enjoyed the detailed footnotes, which filled me in on the historical context of the duo’s adventures. Some of the mathematical equations and scientific theories were a little overwhelming for my English major mind, but Padua presents them in such a playful way that I didn’t feel intimidated. Whether you love science and math or enjoy literature and history, The Thrilling Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage will have something to interest you.- John D.Click here to find the book at the Prince William County Public Library System.

137,0141981539,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5876605-kam-yung-soh,4,"A very entertaining graphic novel about how it might have been if Ada, Countess of Lovelace and Charles Babbage had managed to bring to life the Analytical Engine. The book starts with the real-life stories of Ada and Babbage, then branches off into a 'pocket universe' where the Analytical Engine is created and run by them.In a series of adventures, the pair hilariously show off the Engine to Queen Victoria who wants to 'RULE THE WORLD!', called to save Britain from a global financial crises, fight off the mathematical Luddites, try to mechanise fiction writing by statistically analysing a book by Mary Ann Evans (George Eliot) and even try to visualise the third dimension (remember, the characters live on a two dimensional page).Probably one of the most hilarious short parts of the book is when George Boole (of Boolean logic fame) is reduces to mubbling ""Error, error,"" when asked a non-boolean question (not a ""Yes"" or ""No"" answer) while being served a drink!The book is full of footnotes by the author pointing out historical, mathematical, engineering and computing references to the situations depicted. Making the book more true to life is the effort the author went through to ensure that the words being said in the novel closely match what Ada, Babbage and other characters (like Isambard Kingdom Brunel) actually said or wrote in real life.The book ends with a very technical appendix outlining how Babbage's Analytical Engine would have worked if it actually had been built.A very entertaining read indeed."
138,0141981539,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18850156-stewart-tame,4,"This book was a genuine delight! Inspired by history, Sydney Padua drew a comic strip about Babbage's analytical engine and his relationship with Ada Lovelace. His engine was never built, and Lovelace died young of cancer, so the story doesn't end well. So she added a bit to the end of the strip about how, in another universe, the two went on to build the engine and fight crime. Just a throwaway gag to lighten the mood, make the ending less of a downer. Reaction from the internet was swift, and Padua found herself charged with creating more adventures for her intrepid heroes. And so a legend was born. There's much quirk and charm in this book. There are extensive footnotes, and footnotes to the footnotes--more of these strips are based in fact than might appear at first glance. Don't let the footnotes put you off, though, because there's a breathless enthusiasm to them that makes them a treat to read. Padua is enthusiastic about science and history, and it's contagious. Probably incurable, too. At various times her artwork reminded me of Phil Foglio, Larry Gonick, and even Will Eisner. The footnotes reminded me of Randall Munroe (of xkcd fame.) There's a nice cartoony roundness to her line that makes me smile. This is a marvelous book, particularly if one is a fan of science and/or history and/or steampunk, but even if none of those describe you, you may want to check this book out anyway. Very fun stuff!"
139,0141981539,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63176142-surly,4,"I came across this comic at the Bakken Museum (a small but fun electricity-themed museum in Southwest Minneapolis) and was intrigued by the art, but didn't pick it up, and then checked out a copy from my local library. Now I'm sincerely regretting that I didn't buy it. Padua offers an affectionate portrait of the inventors of the computer (Babbage) and computer programming (Lovelace). While Padua imagines a world where they successfully operate a functioning computer, she bases her flights on a deep reading of the historical record, revealing her principals' personalities and their cultural context in Victorian England. The dialogue is witty and often funny (when not directly borrowed from the principals' correspondence) and supported by legions of footnotes and endnotes that are as entertaining as the images.The art is superb. I loved the character designs and how expressive Padua made them. And she also takes risks with composition, using perspective and page orientation to convey literary and mathematical concepts. For that matter, Padua uses Babbage's original diagrams to sketch out a simplified version of Babbage's unfinished computer, carefully illustrating how processes were accomplished mechanically, offering both visual and written explanations for the reader. It's the rare comic book that engages with both story and an intelligent analysis of the underlying science and history. Highly recommended. "
140,0141981539,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27591228-lapl-reads,4,"Charles Babbage is widely credited with inventing the first computer, depending on your definition of “computer” and “invent”. You see, he never actually finished his masterpiece, the Analytical Engine. Ada Lovelace, the daughter of Lord Byron, was a mathematician who wrote programs for this nascent computer, making her the first computer programmer. Together they were innovators and eccentrics with genuine affection for one another. What could be more fun than a book based on their lives and collaboration? How about a graphic novel based on their story? How about a graphic novel full of extensively researched and annotated science and Victorian history, illustrated with a stylish steampunk flair? The Thrilling Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage is all of this and more. The graphic novel takes their work and lives as a jumping off point and imagines an entire alternate universe where they had the time and means to finish their engine. (In the real world Ada died young and Charles was perpetually trying to pry more money out of the government.) With their analytical engine complete, alternate Lovelace and Babbage can turn to other issues: such as the use of cats in computers, explosions, and fighting crime.

I also love that the author decided to imagine a world in which Lovelace didn't die tragically young, and then went on to have exciting mathematical and mechanical adventures with Babbage.Where this book loses me is in the detailed explanation and analysis of the mathematics and computer science of the analytical machine. It's a lot to wrap your brain around, and after trying very hard to understand and struggling, I was reminded of the fact that I stopped taking computer science courses in college when it got to this point (the theoretical) and I no longer found it enjoyable. At this point in my reading, I decided I didn't want my difficulty in understanding the mathematics to take away from my enjoyment of the art and story, so I started skimming the sciencey bits. I am, in fact, an adult, and can therefore read and not read whatever I want! :PI would especially recommend this book to someone who enjoys and understands computer science, but it is also entertaining on a more surface level for someone like me, who has an interest in computer things and history, despite their lack of technical knowledge (and lack of desire to obtain said knowledge)."

The art is distinctive and fun, and the main characters (Babbage and Lovelace) are joined by others that appear a few times (Brunel and Wellington), and other famous Victorians; scientists, authors and royals alike.The mixing of history, science and fun is delightful, and each is explored more in depth in its own section. The comics themselves are designed to be funny, while the footnotes and endnotes give more detailed information. The first appendix is a compilation of the author's favourite primary sources about Babbage and Lovelace. The second appendix is an explanation of the never built Analytical Machine, complete with diagrams to provide a clear view of the components and working of the machine.Overall this is a fun book that should appeal to those interested in Babbage and Lovelace, who may also enjoy learning about the Analytical Engine."

When it does so through a comic book form that employs a pocket universe that loops back on itself (both theoretically and narratively) and employs many of the technological wonders and famous figures of nineteenth century Britain in so doing, I marvel at this gem of a unique book that piques so many of my interests that I may need a difference engine to calculate the figure.

156,0141981539,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8590635-chad,5,"TL;DR Summary: I found this book amazing, inspiring, and perhaps a little magnificent. Having read it, and the author's commentary, it's easy for me to understand how the author found the subject of Ada Lovelace's life so captivating. The remainder of this review is a description of how, and why, it had such a significant impact on me when I read it.For more than a quarter century, I recall thinking at almost all times that I disliked math. I then encountered a math teacher in college, Dr. Blaga Pauley, whose engaging and philosophical teaching style -- which felt more like a conversation about what was most intriguing about math than like formal education -- helped me realize that what I disliked so strongly was not math itself, but the way people seem to think it must be dictated and drilled. Math is, in fact, a beautiful realm of brilliant insights, elegant systems, intricate designs, and the power to create new understanding.I was not (within myself) ready to carry on with math as a more significant pursuit on my own, yet, and a variety of circumstances conspired to keep me from getting the kind of mentorship I needed to reach that readiness. It is difficult to break free from decades of being indoctrinated in the belief that mathematics is a bureaucratic, dreary, tedious field of academic irrelevance, and other (more comfortable, at the time) interests easily distracted me from taking my education in math any further than strictly necessary for all the interests I pursued instead. Even so, the ideas around math as presented by Blaga (before she passed away) stuck with me, and led me to collect a few books for later reading -- a ""later"" that, until now, never came.Along the way, I heard of this book, and someone gave it to me as a gift. Perhaps it was because I asked for it; I don't recall. Time passed, and this year (2019) I finally picked it up and read it. Reading this awoke in me a greater interest in the real-world intellectual adventures of the Countess of Lovelace (the evident originator of general-purpose programming as a field of study and perhaps even the foundation-layer of computer science) and Charles Babbage (the inventor of the Analytical Engine). More significantly for me, perhaps, is the fact this book is what seems to have finally pushed me over the precipice into a plunge into the depths of desire to really learn more about (and seek fuller understanding of) mathematics as a field of exploration rather than simple study. This book has changed my mindset again, like Blaga's instruction did almost twenty years ago, and I rather suspect that when I think back on this in a few years I will be able to say that those two events together have conspired to change my life.I do not know whether this book can help change anyone else's life for the better, but I recommend it without reservation to anyone considering whether it is worth reading. If you hesitated to dedicate time to it before reading this review, hesitate no longer. It really was an amazing experience for me, and I hope it will be for you, too."
157,0141981539,http://goodreads.com/user/show/772327-christopher,4,"Oh my was this fun! I enjoyed the heck out of this book. My daughter enjoyed the heck out of this book. It's clear the author enjoyed the heck out of this book.So the book starts with a historical account of Charles Babbage, Ada Lovelace, and the Difference Engine (and it's progeny the Analytical Engine) - presented in an entertaining storytelling style, complete with footnotes and endnotes - (akin to the Cartoon History of the Universe I, Vol. 1-7: From the Big Bang to Alexander the Great). So far, so good. But this section ends quickly and on a down-note with Lovelace dead of cancer and Babbage unable to get over himself to actually build any of his designs.But as we have seen in so much alternate history from The Difference Engine to Fiddlehead, the idea of a Victorian-era steam-and-cogs computer is just too good to let facts reign and history to have the last say. So Sydney Padua transports us to a pocket universe where the laws of physics are set to maximize entertainment value and the book roars onward, now looking increasingly like Girl Genius, Vol. 1: Agatha Heterodyne and the Beetleburg Clank only with a historically accurate cast of characters instead of a fictional one (well except for Minion the Footman).Oh, and the footnotes continue. Almost every statement uttered by Lovelace, Babbage, or various supporting characters in the book is straight from their own writings or supported with primary documents. And the supporting cast is broad from the Duke of Wellington, to Islambard Kingdom Brunel, to George Eliot, to Lewis Carroll/Charles Dodgson, to Queen Victoria herself. Eventually the footnotes themselves become a character in a Wonderland-inspired investigation into the truth of Ada Lovelace's character and contribution to the Analytical Engine and computer science as a field.And throughout this all, as we watch these absurd Victorian characters and learn about the design of the Analytical Engine and the logic of computing, there's another story being told. The author is able to show us so much about Babbage and Lovelace's personalities and victories because of the triumph of computing. The Google Books project and others like it have opened the world of historical primary sources to interested amateurs like Padua in a way that really has never been possible before. The author is able to wade into decades-old debates with a sharp pen and over-looked sources because of the work of Babbage and Lovelace's intellectual progeny who have continued the drive to organize, collate, and analyze the world's knowledge."
158,0141981539,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27837035-heather-jones,5,"This is a delightfully informative and madcap graphic biography (sort-of) of Ada Lovelace and her relationship with proto-computer inventor Charles Babbage and his research. I found it reminiscent of such genre-fracturing works as Larry Gonick’s The Cartoon History of… series or Scott McCloud’s Understanding Comics in the way it simultaneously uses and subverts the conventions of graphic storytelling to bridge the worlds of education and entertainment. (No doubt there are many other works that do similar things, but I don't actually follow graphic novels much, so these are the ones I thought of.)It begins as a straightforward biography of Augusta Ada King, Countess Lovelace, daughter of the mad poet Lord Byron, and very arguably the first computer programmer. The visual storytelling is expanded by the use of footnotes (which often interact amusingly with the other graphic elements) and extensive endnotes that expand on technical points, or issues and personages contemporary to the main themes. (I read it in iBooks format and the e-text has been set up to allow easy movement between the main panels, the endnotes, and large-text versions of both foot- and endnotes.)But the author, having to her dismay hit the limits of pure biography, due to Lovelace’s tragically short life and Babbage’s failure to actually realize any of his amazing inventions, plunges on sideways into an alternate steampunk universe in which Lovelace and Babbage actually build the analytical engine and use it to…wait for it…fight crime! (And other adventurous pursuits.) Here the story explodes into a mash-up of actual history, deranged tour through the political and literary landscape of mid-19th century Britain, and technical manual.I loved how the story returned to the essentials of steampunk as a genre (as opposed to an artistic aesthetic) in highlighting the exploits of larger-than-life 19th century figures whose dreams and inventive imaginations outstripped the technology of the day. It does not, however, ignore the aesthetic side of steampunk, and aficionados will find all their favorite goggles, Rube-Goldbergian technology, and dashing women in gender-bending historic clothing.Whether you read the central graphic story purely as entertainment, or delve deeply enough into the technical appendices to understand just how Babbage’s engine was intended to work (and the reasons why it was unlikely to have done so), or split the difference by meditating on the ways in which a brilliant mind like Lovelace’s was betrayed and undermined by the age she lived in, this is a book I recommend in the strongest terms."
159,0141981539,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5033966-kaia,5,"First things first, let's get some assumptions out of the way. 1) This book has a lot of footnotes and endnotes. I did not count, but there may be more footnotes/endnotes than actual graphic content. That being said, they are absolutely charming footnotes that I loved reading. Granted, the historical Lovelace is known for translating and annotating a speech by Babbage, where her notes were at least double the size of the original text, which may be intentional.2) This is a graphic novel, but it comes from a web comic so it doesn't have a fully cohesive feel. These are short, episodic stories, but there isn't any sort of overarching plot line.Now, these are two things that I would expect would work against this book, but Padua pulls this all off so charmingly. Here's the story--Charles Babbage is known for designing the first proto-computer, but never actually building one. He struck up a friendship with Ada Lovelace, the daughter of Lord Byron, who learned mathematics from a very young age to try to weaken any ""poetical"" influences from her father (this is a true story). Ada was fascinated by the machine and it's applications, and described how it could be used, including what some consider to be the first computer program. Alas, Lovelace died young and Babbage never built his machine. On a whim, Sydney Padua illustrates this story and ends with a panel wondering what could have been--if Ada lived and Babbage built his machine?This ""What If?"" sends Padua down a deep research hole into the lives of Lovelace and Babbage, and in the end she imagines this alternate (steampunk) universe where a steam computer exists and Lovelace and Babbage get into scrapes and adventures using it. Padua's enthusiasm for the topic and for the friendship between Lovelace and Babbage simply oozes from every page of this book. In the end, this unabashed enthusiasm is what sells the book for me.Many of the footnotes are very funny, comments on sources, on strange things she came across during her research, asides and did you knows about Victorian society (the niche Victorian genre of theological satire using cheese-mites, Uranus originally named George), and an abundance of Victorian lit/math/computer science jokes, with a few cat jokes thrown in for good measure.If you like Kate Beaton's Hark, A Vagrant!, you'll probably like this book. If you're interested in Victoriana or women in STEM or the history of computers or steampunk adventures, you'll probably like this book."
160,0141981539,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43720549-randy-allain,5,"I have never been particularly drawn to the world of graphic novels or web comics, but the premise of mathematical renegades solving problems with a steam-powered Victorian computer convinced me to give this one a try. Sydney Padua's novel starts with a thoughtful biography of Ada King: Countess of Lovelace and daughter of Lord Byron. After explaining that Ada was pushed into mathematics to shelter her from poetry (the “Byron devil”), the book illustrates Ada's affinity for abstract math and her eventual fascination with Charles Babbage's plans for a steam-powered analytical engine. After working extensively with Babbage, obsessively annotating his plans, and writing hypothetical punch-card “programs” for his hypothetical computer, Ada died from cancer at a young age. Babbage never got around to building his analytical engine. Padua was so disappointed in this bitter ending that she constructed a “pocket universe” in which the mathematicians follow-through with their plans to build the engine....hence the, “thrilling adventures.”I would have rated this book a 3 or a 4 based on the comics alone. They were very interesting and the artwork was fantastic – but the comics never quite followed-through with the “thrills” promised in the title. Instead, the thrills came from Padua's impressive empathy for her characters and obsessive research. Not only is her love for the subject matter inspiring, it also provides a great window into the atmosphere of Victorian London. Just about every page of the book is filled with detailed footnotes explaining the historical basis for her characters, jokes, and adventures. All of the information Padua can't fit into the footnotes can be found in extensive endnotes following each adventure and fascinating appendices in which Padua provides her own sketches of the analytical engine (and many of its individual mechanisms) and some of her favorite primary documents. Yes, even the endnotes and appendices have footnotes - and on many occasions the footnotes go meta: they become scattered in explosions, Queen Victoria blocks them out for being too boring, etc. As an English nerd – I couldn't help but give the novel a 5-star rating."

I don't know, honestly. Though the book is highly text heavy, it's easy to skip over the historical notes and footnotes, if you prefer to just read the extremely cute and wonderful comics. Me, I read EVERYTHING. I'm not particularly what one would call a history nut, but if you give me background information on why a comment was actually hilarious given the context or how that line of dialogue actually came from a letter sent by Lovelace to ----- or diagrams of the Analytical Engine or anything really in cute little (and not so little) foot and end notes (and appendixes!!), I will be reading all of them.Some of my favorite panels were from The Client:(All the panels above from The Client are all rough comics and look much nicer and different in the book.)But the whole book is really just lovely and hilarious and absurd and beautiful. And as glad as I am that Padua gave readers a background on Lovelace and Babbage and their real life story, (which is drawn so ADORABLY, even when I was practically wailing at how sad it was), I am infinitely more glad that she wrote a version of their lives set in a Pocket Universe that plays out so much better."
162,0141981539,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7706994-harshit-sahay,5,"This is far from a traditional book or even a traditional graphic novel, at least structurally. Hence reading it like one might not be the wisest thing to do. Originally a webcomic, this is a collection of the Adventures of Charles Babbage and Ada Lovelace, in an alternate universe where they were far more successful than our current one. However, Sydney Padua uses the narrative of the universe as merely an excuse to have fun with the 2 central characters and their often glaring flaws, as well as their genius. This creates some nice comedic plots that involve other figures from that age and time as well. Padua uses footnotes as a mechanism of delving into THE ACTUAL history of this duo, providing us with snippets of information that add dimensions to their characters one doesn't really find in schoolbooks. The footnotes help Padua ground the jokes or punch-lines in the comic to incidents in the actual lives of its protagonists in a manner which is extremely elegant. Indeed, a lot of humour is also derived from self-awareness, especially the bits about the ""2-D Goggles"" and the concept of the Pocket Universe. Non-fiction works that deal with subjects in science often have a fatal flaw- a hand-wavy approach to actual science, and an unnecessary focus on often irrelevant details that just appeal more. Padua circumvents that by establishing a completely imaginary world where her imagination can runaway on fantastical adventures with no constraints on reality. However, to her credit, she delves A LOT into the history of the central characters and the world they inhabited in the form of footnotes and endnotes, which provide the reader with exposition and context for the comic, as well as the actual story. This is both incredibly well researched, and also incredibly funny. One can but appreciate the amount of work Sydney Padua put into this, to be able to quote almost any document mentioning either of the two during their lives. This is the best kind of book, one that teaches you things, and does so in a manner that'll leave you in splits."
163,0141981539,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1842352-shomeret,3,"I've been an Ada Lovelace fan for some time. She's one of my historical obsessions. There's something irresistible about Lord Byron's daughter having been a brilliant mathematician who wrote the first computer program. If she had lived longer, who knows what else she might have accomplished. I'll read anything about Ada. This book isn't the first alternate history Ada that I've encountered, but it's definitely the most fun conceptually. It's also the first graphic book I've seen with footnotes and endnotes. Some of the notes are as entertaining as the dialogue and captions. Unfortunately, not all of the content was entertaining. I'm not a mathematician. There are sections of this book that got too technical for me. I skimmed them. I did enjoy parts of this book a great deal, but there were others that I considered a snooze fest."

165,0141981539,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9862074-chris,5,"One part whimsical, pulpy comic and two parts historical anecdotes and footnotes in an amazingly well-designed package, this book is perhaps my favorite version of these stories published. Lovelace & Babbage has appeared previously on the web and (in limited form) in a standalone iPad app, but in this hardcover package it definitely shines. Just from a production standpoint, it stands out; multiple fonts, great layout work, and an incredible cover and dust jacket.Furthermore, there's content in this book that is, I believe, otherwise not available in other formats. I'm not completely sure, but I do not believe I've read the Alice in Wonderland pastiche featured in the final story ""Imaginary Quantities"" anywhere else. Nonetheless it is a standout addition to the L&B canon. In addition, there's some great appendixes with primary source documents (mostly letters from or about Babbage) which sheds some interesting insight into the two protagonists' real lives. There's also a wonderfully illustrated explanation of how the Analytical Engine would look and function.Just about the only thing missing is the major story ""Lovelace & Babbage vs. Organized Crime,"" the eleven part series where our mathematical heroes fight the dastardly plots of organ grinding street performers. But given that that story is probably as long or longer than all the other comics in this work, I can understand why it was left out. Perhaps we'll get a standalone book for that in the future?This collection sits firmly with other fictional-yet-nonfictional works like Logicomix or Action Philosophers. If you're a fan of those books, I genuinely think you'll like this one—and if you liked this one, pick up those other ones! They'll have fewer footnotes, but be just as entertaining and engrossing."

Cartoonist Sydney Padua uses the true story of Charles Babbage and Ada Lovelace as a starting point for her fantastic fictions set in a parallel universe in which the two great thinkers are able to find funding for their magnificent Difference Engine and put it to work in a variety of entertaining and useful ways. Though wildly imaginative, the book is heavily researched and annotated, and you’ll get to see Babbage and Lovelace interact with many familiar names, like Queen Victoria and Charles Dickens, while also learning about some of the era’s less celebrated heroes, such as Isambard Kingdom Brunel.I was fascinated by the story of Babbage and Lovelace, two historical figures I knew next to nothing about, and I particularly enjoyed the detailed footnotes, which filled me in on the historical context of the duo’s adventures. Some of the mathematical equations and scientific theories were a little overwhelming for my English major mind, but Padua presents them in such a playful way that I didn’t feel intimidated. Whether you love science and math or enjoy literature and history, The Thrilling Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage will have something to interest you.- John D.Click here to find the book at the Prince William County Public Library System.

167,0141981539,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5876605-kam-yung-soh,4,"A very entertaining graphic novel about how it might have been if Ada, Countess of Lovelace and Charles Babbage had managed to bring to life the Analytical Engine. The book starts with the real-life stories of Ada and Babbage, then branches off into a 'pocket universe' where the Analytical Engine is created and run by them.In a series of adventures, the pair hilariously show off the Engine to Queen Victoria who wants to 'RULE THE WORLD!', called to save Britain from a global financial crises, fight off the mathematical Luddites, try to mechanise fiction writing by statistically analysing a book by Mary Ann Evans (George Eliot) and even try to visualise the third dimension (remember, the characters live on a two dimensional page).Probably one of the most hilarious short parts of the book is when George Boole (of Boolean logic fame) is reduces to mubbling ""Error, error,"" when asked a non-boolean question (not a ""Yes"" or ""No"" answer) while being served a drink!The book is full of footnotes by the author pointing out historical, mathematical, engineering and computing references to the situations depicted. Making the book more true to life is the effort the author went through to ensure that the words being said in the novel closely match what Ada, Babbage and other characters (like Isambard Kingdom Brunel) actually said or wrote in real life.The book ends with a very technical appendix outlining how Babbage's Analytical Engine would have worked if it actually had been built.A very entertaining read indeed."
168,0141981539,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18850156-stewart-tame,4,"This book was a genuine delight! Inspired by history, Sydney Padua drew a comic strip about Babbage's analytical engine and his relationship with Ada Lovelace. His engine was never built, and Lovelace died young of cancer, so the story doesn't end well. So she added a bit to the end of the strip about how, in another universe, the two went on to build the engine and fight crime. Just a throwaway gag to lighten the mood, make the ending less of a downer. Reaction from the internet was swift, and Padua found herself charged with creating more adventures for her intrepid heroes. And so a legend was born. There's much quirk and charm in this book. There are extensive footnotes, and footnotes to the footnotes--more of these strips are based in fact than might appear at first glance. Don't let the footnotes put you off, though, because there's a breathless enthusiasm to them that makes them a treat to read. Padua is enthusiastic about science and history, and it's contagious. Probably incurable, too. At various times her artwork reminded me of Phil Foglio, Larry Gonick, and even Will Eisner. The footnotes reminded me of Randall Munroe (of xkcd fame.) There's a nice cartoony roundness to her line that makes me smile. This is a marvelous book, particularly if one is a fan of science and/or history and/or steampunk, but even if none of those describe you, you may want to check this book out anyway. Very fun stuff!"
169,0141981539,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63176142-surly,4,"I came across this comic at the Bakken Museum (a small but fun electricity-themed museum in Southwest Minneapolis) and was intrigued by the art, but didn't pick it up, and then checked out a copy from my local library. Now I'm sincerely regretting that I didn't buy it. Padua offers an affectionate portrait of the inventors of the computer (Babbage) and computer programming (Lovelace). While Padua imagines a world where they successfully operate a functioning computer, she bases her flights on a deep reading of the historical record, revealing her principals' personalities and their cultural context in Victorian England. The dialogue is witty and often funny (when not directly borrowed from the principals' correspondence) and supported by legions of footnotes and endnotes that are as entertaining as the images.The art is superb. I loved the character designs and how expressive Padua made them. And she also takes risks with composition, using perspective and page orientation to convey literary and mathematical concepts. For that matter, Padua uses Babbage's original diagrams to sketch out a simplified version of Babbage's unfinished computer, carefully illustrating how processes were accomplished mechanically, offering both visual and written explanations for the reader. It's the rare comic book that engages with both story and an intelligent analysis of the underlying science and history. Highly recommended. "
170,0141981539,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27591228-lapl-reads,4,"Charles Babbage is widely credited with inventing the first computer, depending on your definition of “computer” and “invent”. You see, he never actually finished his masterpiece, the Analytical Engine. Ada Lovelace, the daughter of Lord Byron, was a mathematician who wrote programs for this nascent computer, making her the first computer programmer. Together they were innovators and eccentrics with genuine affection for one another. What could be more fun than a book based on their lives and collaboration? How about a graphic novel based on their story? How about a graphic novel full of extensively researched and annotated science and Victorian history, illustrated with a stylish steampunk flair? The Thrilling Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage is all of this and more. The graphic novel takes their work and lives as a jumping off point and imagines an entire alternate universe where they had the time and means to finish their engine. (In the real world Ada died young and Charles was perpetually trying to pry more money out of the government.) With their analytical engine complete, alternate Lovelace and Babbage can turn to other issues: such as the use of cats in computers, explosions, and fighting crime. This is a fun story, packed full of information, charm, and history.Reviewed by Andrea Borchert, Librarian, Science, Technology & Patents Department"
171,0141981539,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2187833-rach,3,"I love the art and style of this book, and the history of these fascinating people that were so well-known in their own times, yet nearly forgotten in ours. I also love that the author decided to imagine a world in which Lovelace didn't die tragically young, and then went on to have exciting mathematical and mechanical adventures with Babbage.Where this book loses me is in the detailed explanation and analysis of the mathematics and computer science of the analytical machine. It's a lot to wrap your brain around, and after trying very hard to understand and struggling, I was reminded of the fact that I stopped taking computer science courses in college when it got to this point (the theoretical) and I no longer found it enjoyable. At this point in my reading, I decided I didn't want my difficulty in understanding the mathematics to take away from my enjoyment of the art and story, so I started skimming the sciencey bits. I am, in fact, an adult, and can therefore read and not read whatever I want! :PI would especially recommend this book to someone who enjoys and understands computer science, but it is also entertaining on a more surface level for someone like me, who has an interest in computer things and history, despite their lack of technical knowledge (and lack of desire to obtain said knowledge)."
172,0141981539,http://goodreads.com/user/show/79487053-billy,5,"This is a lovely collection of comics, most of them set in an alternate universe in which Babbage completed his Analytical Engine, supplemented by extra information drawn from letters, memoirs and Babbage's own autobiaography. The art is distinctive and fun, and the main characters (Babbage and Lovelace) are joined by others that appear a few times (Brunel and Wellington), and other famous Victorians; scientists, authors and royals alike.The mixing of history, science and fun is delightful, and each is explored more in depth in its own section. The comics themselves are designed to be funny, while the footnotes and endnotes give more detailed information. The first appendix is a compilation of the author's favourite primary sources about Babbage and Lovelace. The second appendix is an explanation of the never built Analytical Machine, complete with diagrams to provide a clear view of the components and working of the machine.Overall this is a fun book that should appeal to those interested in Babbage and Lovelace, who may also enjoy learning about the Analytical Engine."

When that book also illuminates my knowledge of important historical (feminist) figures I've only read snippets about elsewhere, it scores more points. When it does so through a comic book form that employs a pocket universe that loops back on itself (both theoretically and narratively) and employs many of the technological wonders and famous figures of nineteenth century Britain in so doing, I marvel at this gem of a unique book that piques so many of my interests that I may need a difference engine to calculate the figure.

186,0141981539,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8590635-chad,5,"TL;DR Summary: I found this book amazing, inspiring, and perhaps a little magnificent. Having read it, and the author's commentary, it's easy for me to understand how the author found the subject of Ada Lovelace's life so captivating. The remainder of this review is a description of how, and why, it had such a significant impact on me when I read it.For more than a quarter century, I recall thinking at almost all times that I disliked math. I then encountered a math teacher in college, Dr. Blaga Pauley, whose engaging and philosophical teaching style -- which felt more like a conversation about what was most intriguing about math than like formal education -- helped me realize that what I disliked so strongly was not math itself, but the way people seem to think it must be dictated and drilled. Math is, in fact, a beautiful realm of brilliant insights, elegant systems, intricate designs, and the power to create new understanding.I was not (within myself) ready to carry on with math as a more significant pursuit on my own, yet, and a variety of circumstances conspired to keep me from getting the kind of mentorship I needed to reach that readiness. It is difficult to break free from decades of being indoctrinated in the belief that mathematics is a bureaucratic, dreary, tedious field of academic irrelevance, and other (more comfortable, at the time) interests easily distracted me from taking my education in math any further than strictly necessary for all the interests I pursued instead. Even so, the ideas around math as presented by Blaga (before she passed away) stuck with me, and led me to collect a few books for later reading -- a ""later"" that, until now, never came.Along the way, I heard of this book, and someone gave it to me as a gift. Perhaps it was because I asked for it; I don't recall. Time passed, and this year (2019) I finally picked it up and read it. Reading this awoke in me a greater interest in the real-world intellectual adventures of the Countess of Lovelace (the evident originator of general-purpose programming as a field of study and perhaps even the foundation-layer of computer science) and Charles Babbage (the inventor of the Analytical Engine). More significantly for me, perhaps, is the fact this book is what seems to have finally pushed me over the precipice into a plunge into the depths of desire to really learn more about (and seek fuller understanding of) mathematics as a field of exploration rather than simple study. This book has changed my mindset again, like Blaga's instruction did almost twenty years ago, and I rather suspect that when I think back on this in a few years I will be able to say that those two events together have conspired to change my life.I do not know whether this book can help change anyone else's life for the better, but I recommend it without reservation to anyone considering whether it is worth reading. If you hesitated to dedicate time to it before reading this review, hesitate no longer. It really was an amazing experience for me, and I hope it will be for you, too."
187,0141981539,http://goodreads.com/user/show/772327-christopher,4,"Oh my was this fun! I enjoyed the heck out of this book. My daughter enjoyed the heck out of this book. It's clear the author enjoyed the heck out of this book.So the book starts with a historical account of Charles Babbage, Ada Lovelace, and the Difference Engine (and it's progeny the Analytical Engine) - presented in an entertaining storytelling style, complete with footnotes and endnotes - (akin to the Cartoon History of the Universe I, Vol. 1-7: From the Big Bang to Alexander the Great). So far, so good. But this section ends quickly and on a down-note with Lovelace dead of cancer and Babbage unable to get over himself to actually build any of his designs.But as we have seen in so much alternate history from The Difference Engine to Fiddlehead, the idea of a Victorian-era steam-and-cogs computer is just too good to let facts reign and history to have the last say. So Sydney Padua transports us to a pocket universe where the laws of physics are set to maximize entertainment value and the book roars onward, now looking increasingly like Girl Genius, Vol. 1: Agatha Heterodyne and the Beetleburg Clank only with a historically accurate cast of characters instead of a fictional one (well except for Minion the Footman).Oh, and the footnotes continue. Almost every statement uttered by Lovelace, Babbage, or various supporting characters in the book is straight from their own writings or supported with primary documents. And the supporting cast is broad from the Duke of Wellington, to Islambard Kingdom Brunel, to George Eliot, to Lewis Carroll/Charles Dodgson, to Queen Victoria herself. Eventually the footnotes themselves become a character in a Wonderland-inspired investigation into the truth of Ada Lovelace's character and contribution to the Analytical Engine and computer science as a field.And throughout this all, as we watch these absurd Victorian characters and learn about the design of the Analytical Engine and the logic of computing, there's another story being told. The author is able to show us so much about Babbage and Lovelace's personalities and victories because of the triumph of computing. The Google Books project and others like it have opened the world of historical primary sources to interested amateurs like Padua in a way that really has never been possible before. The author is able to wade into decades-old debates with a sharp pen and over-looked sources because of the work of Babbage and Lovelace's intellectual progeny who have continued the drive to organize, collate, and analyze the world's knowledge."
188,0141981539,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27837035-heather-jones,5,"This is a delightfully informative and madcap graphic biography (sort-of) of Ada Lovelace and her relationship with proto-computer inventor Charles Babbage and his research. I found it reminiscent of such genre-fracturing works as Larry Gonick’s The Cartoon History of… series or Scott McCloud’s Understanding Comics in the way it simultaneously uses and subverts the conventions of graphic storytelling to bridge the worlds of education and entertainment. (No doubt there are many other works that do similar things, but I don't actually follow graphic novels much, so these are the ones I thought of.)It begins as a straightforward biography of Augusta Ada King, Countess Lovelace, daughter of the mad poet Lord Byron, and very arguably the first computer programmer. The visual storytelling is expanded by the use of footnotes (which often interact amusingly with the other graphic elements) and extensive endnotes that expand on technical points, or issues and personages contemporary to the main themes. (I read it in iBooks format and the e-text has been set up to allow easy movement between the main panels, the endnotes, and large-text versions of both foot- and endnotes.)But the author, having to her dismay hit the limits of pure biography, due to Lovelace’s tragically short life and Babbage’s failure to actually realize any of his amazing inventions, plunges on sideways into an alternate steampunk universe in which Lovelace and Babbage actually build the analytical engine and use it to…wait for it…fight crime! (And other adventurous pursuits.) Here the story explodes into a mash-up of actual history, deranged tour through the political and literary landscape of mid-19th century Britain, and technical manual.I loved how the story returned to the essentials of steampunk as a genre (as opposed to an artistic aesthetic) in highlighting the exploits of larger-than-life 19th century figures whose dreams and inventive imaginations outstripped the technology of the day. It does not, however, ignore the aesthetic side of steampunk, and aficionados will find all their favorite goggles, Rube-Goldbergian technology, and dashing women in gender-bending historic clothing.Whether you read the central graphic story purely as entertainment, or delve deeply enough into the technical appendices to understand just how Babbage’s engine was intended to work (and the reasons why it was unlikely to have done so), or split the difference by meditating on the ways in which a brilliant mind like Lovelace’s was betrayed and undermined by the age she lived in, this is a book I recommend in the strongest terms."
189,0141981539,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5033966-kaia,5,"First things first, let's get some assumptions out of the way. 1) This book has a lot of footnotes and endnotes. I did not count, but there may be more footnotes/endnotes than actual graphic content. That being said, they are absolutely charming footnotes that I loved reading. Granted, the historical Lovelace is known for translating and annotating a speech by Babbage, where her notes were at least double the size of the original text, which may be intentional.2) This is a graphic novel, but it comes from a web comic so it doesn't have a fully cohesive feel. These are short, episodic stories, but there isn't any sort of overarching plot line.Now, these are two things that I would expect would work against this book, but Padua pulls this all off so charmingly. Here's the story--Charles Babbage is known for designing the first proto-computer, but never actually building one. He struck up a friendship with Ada Lovelace, the daughter of Lord Byron, who learned mathematics from a very young age to try to weaken any ""poetical"" influences from her father (this is a true story). Ada was fascinated by the machine and it's applications, and described how it could be used, including what some consider to be the first computer program. Alas, Lovelace died young and Babbage never built his machine. On a whim, Sydney Padua illustrates this story and ends with a panel wondering what could have been--if Ada lived and Babbage built his machine?This ""What If?"" sends Padua down a deep research hole into the lives of Lovelace and Babbage, and in the end she imagines this alternate (steampunk) universe where a steam computer exists and Lovelace and Babbage get into scrapes and adventures using it. Padua's enthusiasm for the topic and for the friendship between Lovelace and Babbage simply oozes from every page of this book. In the end, this unabashed enthusiasm is what sells the book for me.Many of the footnotes are very funny, comments on sources, on strange things she came across during her research, asides and did you knows about Victorian society (the niche Victorian genre of theological satire using cheese-mites, Uranus originally named George), and an abundance of Victorian lit/math/computer science jokes, with a few cat jokes thrown in for good measure.If you like Kate Beaton's Hark, A Vagrant!, you'll probably like this book. If you're interested in Victoriana or women in STEM or the history of computers or steampunk adventures, you'll probably like this book."
190,0141981539,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43720549-randy-allain,5,"I have never been particularly drawn to the world of graphic novels or web comics, but the premise of mathematical renegades solving problems with a steam-powered Victorian computer convinced me to give this one a try. Sydney Padua's novel starts with a thoughtful biography of Ada King: Countess of Lovelace and daughter of Lord Byron. After explaining that Ada was pushed into mathematics to shelter her from poetry (the “Byron devil”), the book illustrates Ada's affinity for abstract math and her eventual fascination with Charles Babbage's plans for a steam-powered analytical engine. After working extensively with Babbage, obsessively annotating his plans, and writing hypothetical punch-card “programs” for his hypothetical computer, Ada died from cancer at a young age. Babbage never got around to building his analytical engine. Padua was so disappointed in this bitter ending that she constructed a “pocket universe” in which the mathematicians follow-through with their plans to build the engine....hence the, “thrilling adventures.”I would have rated this book a 3 or a 4 based on the comics alone. They were very interesting and the artwork was fantastic – but the comics never quite followed-through with the “thrills” promised in the title. Instead, the thrills came from Padua's impressive empathy for her characters and obsessive research. Not only is her love for the subject matter inspiring, it also provides a great window into the atmosphere of Victorian London. Just about every page of the book is filled with detailed footnotes explaining the historical basis for her characters, jokes, and adventures. All of the information Padua can't fit into the footnotes can be found in extensive endnotes following each adventure and fascinating appendices in which Padua provides her own sketches of the analytical engine (and many of its individual mechanisms) and some of her favorite primary documents. Yes, even the endnotes and appendices have footnotes - and on many occasions the footnotes go meta: they become scattered in explosions, Queen Victoria blocks them out for being too boring, etc. As an English nerd – I couldn't help but give the novel a 5-star rating."
191,0141981539,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11828657-elevetha,4,"!!!!!( http://sydneypadua.com/2dgoggles/wp-c... http://sydneypadua.com/2dgoggles/wp-c... )Now, after reading those delightful panels, who wouldn't want to read this???? I don't know, honestly. Though the book is highly text heavy, it's easy to skip over the historical notes and footnotes, if you prefer to just read the extremely cute and wonderful comics. Me, I read EVERYTHING. I'm not particularly what one would call a history nut, but if you give me background information on why a comment was actually hilarious given the context or how that line of dialogue actually came from a letter sent by Lovelace to ----- or diagrams of the Analytical Engine or anything really in cute little (and not so little) foot and end notes (and appendixes!!), I will be reading all of them.Some of my favorite panels were from The Client:(All the panels above from The Client are all rough comics and look much nicer and different in the book.)But the whole book is really just lovely and hilarious and absurd and beautiful. And as glad as I am that Padua gave readers a background on Lovelace and Babbage and their real life story, (which is drawn so ADORABLY, even when I was practically wailing at how sad it was), I am infinitely more glad that she wrote a version of their lives set in a Pocket Universe that plays out so much better."
192,0141981539,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7706994-harshit-sahay,5,"This is far from a traditional book or even a traditional graphic novel, at least structurally. Hence reading it like one might not be the wisest thing to do. Originally a webcomic, this is a collection of the Adventures of Charles Babbage and Ada Lovelace, in an alternate universe where they were far more successful than our current one. However, Sydney Padua uses the narrative of the universe as merely an excuse to have fun with the 2 central characters and their often glaring flaws, as well as their genius. This creates some nice comedic plots that involve other figures from that age and time as well. Padua uses footnotes as a mechanism of delving into THE ACTUAL history of this duo, providing us with snippets of information that add dimensions to their characters one doesn't really find in schoolbooks. The footnotes help Padua ground the jokes or punch-lines in the comic to incidents in the actual lives of its protagonists in a manner which is extremely elegant. Indeed, a lot of humour is also derived from self-awareness, especially the bits about the ""2-D Goggles"" and the concept of the Pocket Universe. Non-fiction works that deal with subjects in science often have a fatal flaw- a hand-wavy approach to actual science, and an unnecessary focus on often irrelevant details that just appeal more. Padua circumvents that by establishing a completely imaginary world where her imagination can runaway on fantastical adventures with no constraints on reality. However, to her credit, she delves A LOT into the history of the central characters and the world they inhabited in the form of footnotes and endnotes, which provide the reader with exposition and context for the comic, as well as the actual story. This is both incredibly well researched, and also incredibly funny. One can but appreciate the amount of work Sydney Padua put into this, to be able to quote almost any document mentioning either of the two during their lives. This is the best kind of book, one that teaches you things, and does so in a manner that'll leave you in splits."
193,0141981539,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1842352-shomeret,3,"I've been an Ada Lovelace fan for some time. She's one of my historical obsessions. There's something irresistible about Lord Byron's daughter having been a brilliant mathematician who wrote the first computer program. If she had lived longer, who knows what else she might have accomplished. I'll read anything about Ada. This book isn't the first alternate history Ada that I've encountered, but it's definitely the most fun conceptually. It's also the first graphic book I've seen with footnotes and endnotes. Some of the notes are as entertaining as the dialogue and captions. Unfortunately, not all of the content was entertaining. I'm not a mathematician. There are sections of this book that got too technical for me. I skimmed them. I did enjoy parts of this book a great deal, but there were others that I considered a snooze fest."

195,0141981539,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9862074-chris,5,"One part whimsical, pulpy comic and two parts historical anecdotes and footnotes in an amazingly well-designed package, this book is perhaps my favorite version of these stories published. Lovelace & Babbage has appeared previously on the web and (in limited form) in a standalone iPad app, but in this hardcover package it definitely shines. Just from a production standpoint, it stands out; multiple fonts, great layout work, and an incredible cover and dust jacket.Furthermore, there's content in this book that is, I believe, otherwise not available in other formats. I'm not completely sure, but I do not believe I've read the Alice in Wonderland pastiche featured in the final story ""Imaginary Quantities"" anywhere else. Nonetheless it is a standout addition to the L&B canon. In addition, there's some great appendixes with primary source documents (mostly letters from or about Babbage) which sheds some interesting insight into the two protagonists' real lives. There's also a wonderfully illustrated explanation of how the Analytical Engine would look and function.Just about the only thing missing is the major story ""Lovelace & Babbage vs. Organized Crime,"" the eleven part series where our mathematical heroes fight the dastardly plots of organ grinding street performers. But given that that story is probably as long or longer than all the other comics in this work, I can understand why it was left out. Perhaps we'll get a standalone book for that in the future?This collection sits firmly with other fictional-yet-nonfictional works like Logicomix or Action Philosophers. If you're a fan of those books, I genuinely think you'll like this one—and if you liked this one, pick up those other ones! They'll have fewer footnotes, but be just as entertaining and engrossing."

Cartoonist Sydney Padua uses the true story of Charles Babbage and Ada Lovelace as a starting point for her fantastic fictions set in a parallel universe in which the two great thinkers are able to find funding for their magnificent Difference Engine and put it to work in a variety of entertaining and useful ways. Though wildly imaginative, the book is heavily researched and annotated, and you’ll get to see Babbage and Lovelace interact with many familiar names, like Queen Victoria and Charles Dickens, while also learning about some of the era’s less celebrated heroes, such as Isambard Kingdom Brunel.I was fascinated by the story of Babbage and Lovelace, two historical figures I knew next to nothing about, and I particularly enjoyed the detailed footnotes, which filled me in on the historical context of the duo’s adventures. Some of the mathematical equations and scientific theories were a little overwhelming for my English major mind, but Padua presents them in such a playful way that I didn’t feel intimidated. Whether you love science and math or enjoy literature and history, The Thrilling Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage will have something to interest you.- John D.Click here to find the book at the Prince William County Public Library System.

197,0141981539,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5876605-kam-yung-soh,4,"A very entertaining graphic novel about how it might have been if Ada, Countess of Lovelace and Charles Babbage had managed to bring to life the Analytical Engine. The book starts with the real-life stories of Ada and Babbage, then branches off into a 'pocket universe' where the Analytical Engine is created and run by them.In a series of adventures, the pair hilariously show off the Engine to Queen Victoria who wants to 'RULE THE WORLD!', called to save Britain from a global financial crises, fight off the mathematical Luddites, try to mechanise fiction writing by statistically analysing a book by Mary Ann Evans (George Eliot) and even try to visualise the third dimension (remember, the characters live on a two dimensional page).Probably one of the most hilarious short parts of the book is when George Boole (of Boolean logic fame) is reduces to mubbling ""Error, error,"" when asked a non-boolean question (not a ""Yes"" or ""No"" answer) while being served a drink!The book is full of footnotes by the author pointing out historical, mathematical, engineering and computing references to the situations depicted. Making the book more true to life is the effort the author went through to ensure that the words being said in the novel closely match what Ada, Babbage and other characters (like Isambard Kingdom Brunel) actually said or wrote in real life.The book ends with a very technical appendix outlining how Babbage's Analytical Engine would have worked if it actually had been built.A very entertaining read indeed."
198,0141981539,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18850156-stewart-tame,4,"This book was a genuine delight! Inspired by history, Sydney Padua drew a comic strip about Babbage's analytical engine and his relationship with Ada Lovelace. His engine was never built, and Lovelace died young of cancer, so the story doesn't end well. So she added a bit to the end of the strip about how, in another universe, the two went on to build the engine and fight crime. Just a throwaway gag to lighten the mood, make the ending less of a downer. Reaction from the internet was swift, and Padua found herself charged with creating more adventures for her intrepid heroes. And so a legend was born. There's much quirk and charm in this book. There are extensive footnotes, and footnotes to the footnotes--more of these strips are based in fact than might appear at first glance. Don't let the footnotes put you off, though, because there's a breathless enthusiasm to them that makes them a treat to read. Padua is enthusiastic about science and history, and it's contagious. Probably incurable, too. At various times her artwork reminded me of Phil Foglio, Larry Gonick, and even Will Eisner. The footnotes reminded me of Randall Munroe (of xkcd fame.) There's a nice cartoony roundness to her line that makes me smile. This is a marvelous book, particularly if one is a fan of science and/or history and/or steampunk, but even if none of those describe you, you may want to check this book out anyway. Very fun stuff!"
199,0141981539,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63176142-surly,4,"I came across this comic at the Bakken Museum (a small but fun electricity-themed museum in Southwest Minneapolis) and was intrigued by the art, but didn't pick it up, and then checked out a copy from my local library. Now I'm sincerely regretting that I didn't buy it. Padua offers an affectionate portrait of the inventors of the computer (Babbage) and computer programming (Lovelace). While Padua imagines a world where they successfully operate a functioning computer, she bases her flights on a deep reading of the historical record, revealing her principals' personalities and their cultural context in Victorian England. The dialogue is witty and often funny (when not directly borrowed from the principals' correspondence) and supported by legions of footnotes and endnotes that are as entertaining as the images.The art is superb. I loved the character designs and how expressive Padua made them. And she also takes risks with composition, using perspective and page orientation to convey literary and mathematical concepts. For that matter, Padua uses Babbage's original diagrams to sketch out a simplified version of Babbage's unfinished computer, carefully illustrating how processes were accomplished mechanically, offering both visual and written explanations for the reader. It's the rare comic book that engages with both story and an intelligent analysis of the underlying science and history. Highly recommended. "
200,0141981539,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27591228-lapl-reads,4,"Charles Babbage is widely credited with inventing the first computer, depending on your definition of “computer” and “invent”. You see, he never actually finished his masterpiece, the Analytical Engine. Ada Lovelace, the daughter of Lord Byron, was a mathematician who wrote programs for this nascent computer, making her the first computer programmer. Together they were innovators and eccentrics with genuine affection for one another. What could be more fun than a book based on their lives and collaboration? How about a graphic novel based on their story? How about a graphic novel full of extensively researched and annotated science and Victorian history, illustrated with a stylish steampunk flair? The Thrilling Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage is all of this and more. The graphic novel takes their work and lives as a jumping off point and imagines an entire alternate universe where they had the time and means to finish their engine. (In the real world Ada died young and Charles was perpetually trying to pry more money out of the government.) With their analytical engine complete, alternate Lovelace and Babbage can turn to other issues: such as the use of cats in computers, explosions, and fighting crime. This is a fun story, packed full of information, charm, and history.Reviewed by Andrea Borchert, Librarian, Science, Technology & Patents Department"
201,0141981539,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2187833-rach,3,"I love the art and style of this book, and the history of these fascinating people that were so well-known in their own times, yet nearly forgotten in ours. I also love that the author decided to imagine a world in which Lovelace didn't die tragically young, and then went on to have exciting mathematical and mechanical adventures with Babbage.Where this book loses me is in the detailed explanation and analysis of the mathematics and computer science of the analytical machine. It's a lot to wrap your brain around, and after trying very hard to understand and struggling, I was reminded of the fact that I stopped taking computer science courses in college when it got to this point (the theoretical) and I no longer found it enjoyable. At this point in my reading, I decided I didn't want my difficulty in understanding the mathematics to take away from my enjoyment of the art and story, so I started skimming the sciencey bits. I am, in fact, an adult, and can therefore read and not read whatever I want! :PI would especially recommend this book to someone who enjoys and understands computer science, but it is also entertaining on a more surface level for someone like me, who has an interest in computer things and history, despite their lack of technical knowledge (and lack of desire to obtain said knowledge)."
202,0141981539,http://goodreads.com/user/show/79487053-billy,5,"This is a lovely collection of comics, most of them set in an alternate universe in which Babbage completed his Analytical Engine, supplemented by extra information drawn from letters, memoirs and Babbage's own autobiaography. The art is distinctive and fun, and the main characters (Babbage and Lovelace) are joined by others that appear a few times (Brunel and Wellington), and other famous Victorians; scientists, authors and royals alike.The mixing of history, science and fun is delightful, and each is explored more in depth in its own section. The comics themselves are designed to be funny, while the footnotes and endnotes give more detailed information. The first appendix is a compilation of the author's favourite primary sources about Babbage and Lovelace. The second appendix is an explanation of the never built Analytical Machine, complete with diagrams to provide a clear view of the components and working of the machine.Overall this is a fun book that should appeal to those interested in Babbage and Lovelace, who may also enjoy learning about the Analytical Engine."

Loved it. It's not a reference book (as other reviews have complained??) but provides enough background for the curious, and plenty of references if you want to take it further - I'll almost certainly pick up a copy of Babbage's autobiography based on the excepts quoted in this book."

When that book also illuminates my knowledge of important historical (feminist) figures I've only read snippets about elsewhere, it scores more points. When it does so through a comic book form that employs a pocket universe that loops back on itself (both theoretically and narratively) and employs many of the technological wonders and famous figures of nineteenth century Britain in so doing, I marvel at this gem of a unique book that piques so many of my interests that I may need a difference engine to calculate the figure.

It's both biography and fiction and makes me wonder what would have happened if someone had made Babbage build his engine, though I have a sneaking suspicion that a cattle prod would have been needed.Lovelace would still have died of cancer tho.Made me also think about how good enough is better than never done."

Padua may have lost me a couple of times towards the end, but I never once felt patronised, and came away feeling both entertained and educated. I'm also really fond of her art style, it felt on occasion like a more stylised version of a lot of the illustrations I saw when I was younger, which was unexpectedly nostalgic."

216,0141981539,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8590635-chad,5,"TL;DR Summary: I found this book amazing, inspiring, and perhaps a little magnificent. Having read it, and the author's commentary, it's easy for me to understand how the author found the subject of Ada Lovelace's life so captivating. The remainder of this review is a description of how, and why, it had such a significant impact on me when I read it.For more than a quarter century, I recall thinking at almost all times that I disliked math. I then encountered a math teacher in college, Dr. Blaga Pauley, whose engaging and philosophical teaching style -- which felt more like a conversation about what was most intriguing about math than like formal education -- helped me realize that what I disliked so strongly was not math itself, but the way people seem to think it must be dictated and drilled. Math is, in fact, a beautiful realm of brilliant insights, elegant systems, intricate designs, and the power to create new understanding.I was not (within myself) ready to carry on with math as a more significant pursuit on my own, yet, and a variety of circumstances conspired to keep me from getting the kind of mentorship I needed to reach that readiness. It is difficult to break free from decades of being indoctrinated in the belief that mathematics is a bureaucratic, dreary, tedious field of academic irrelevance, and other (more comfortable, at the time) interests easily distracted me from taking my education in math any further than strictly necessary for all the interests I pursued instead. Even so, the ideas around math as presented by Blaga (before she passed away) stuck with me, and led me to collect a few books for later reading -- a ""later"" that, until now, never came.Along the way, I heard of this book, and someone gave it to me as a gift. Perhaps it was because I asked for it; I don't recall. Time passed, and this year (2019) I finally picked it up and read it. Reading this awoke in me a greater interest in the real-world intellectual adventures of the Countess of Lovelace (the evident originator of general-purpose programming as a field of study and perhaps even the foundation-layer of computer science) and Charles Babbage (the inventor of the Analytical Engine). More significantly for me, perhaps, is the fact this book is what seems to have finally pushed me over the precipice into a plunge into the depths of desire to really learn more about (and seek fuller understanding of) mathematics as a field of exploration rather than simple study. This book has changed my mindset again, like Blaga's instruction did almost twenty years ago, and I rather suspect that when I think back on this in a few years I will be able to say that those two events together have conspired to change my life.I do not know whether this book can help change anyone else's life for the better, but I recommend it without reservation to anyone considering whether it is worth reading. If you hesitated to dedicate time to it before reading this review, hesitate no longer. It really was an amazing experience for me, and I hope it will be for you, too."
217,0141981539,http://goodreads.com/user/show/772327-christopher,4,"Oh my was this fun! I enjoyed the heck out of this book. My daughter enjoyed the heck out of this book. It's clear the author enjoyed the heck out of this book.So the book starts with a historical account of Charles Babbage, Ada Lovelace, and the Difference Engine (and it's progeny the Analytical Engine) - presented in an entertaining storytelling style, complete with footnotes and endnotes - (akin to the Cartoon History of the Universe I, Vol. 1-7: From the Big Bang to Alexander the Great). So far, so good. But this section ends quickly and on a down-note with Lovelace dead of cancer and Babbage unable to get over himself to actually build any of his designs.But as we have seen in so much alternate history from The Difference Engine to Fiddlehead, the idea of a Victorian-era steam-and-cogs computer is just too good to let facts reign and history to have the last say. So Sydney Padua transports us to a pocket universe where the laws of physics are set to maximize entertainment value and the book roars onward, now looking increasingly like Girl Genius, Vol. 1: Agatha Heterodyne and the Beetleburg Clank only with a historically accurate cast of characters instead of a fictional one (well except for Minion the Footman).Oh, and the footnotes continue. Almost every statement uttered by Lovelace, Babbage, or various supporting characters in the book is straight from their own writings or supported with primary documents. And the supporting cast is broad from the Duke of Wellington, to Islambard Kingdom Brunel, to George Eliot, to Lewis Carroll/Charles Dodgson, to Queen Victoria herself. Eventually the footnotes themselves become a character in a Wonderland-inspired investigation into the truth of Ada Lovelace's character and contribution to the Analytical Engine and computer science as a field.And throughout this all, as we watch these absurd Victorian characters and learn about the design of the Analytical Engine and the logic of computing, there's another story being told. The author is able to show us so much about Babbage and Lovelace's personalities and victories because of the triumph of computing. The Google Books project and others like it have opened the world of historical primary sources to interested amateurs like Padua in a way that really has never been possible before. The author is able to wade into decades-old debates with a sharp pen and over-looked sources because of the work of Babbage and Lovelace's intellectual progeny who have continued the drive to organize, collate, and analyze the world's knowledge."
218,0141981539,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27837035-heather-jones,5,"This is a delightfully informative and madcap graphic biography (sort-of) of Ada Lovelace and her relationship with proto-computer inventor Charles Babbage and his research. I found it reminiscent of such genre-fracturing works as Larry Gonick’s The Cartoon History of… series or Scott McCloud’s Understanding Comics in the way it simultaneously uses and subverts the conventions of graphic storytelling to bridge the worlds of education and entertainment. (No doubt there are many other works that do similar things, but I don't actually follow graphic novels much, so these are the ones I thought of.)It begins as a straightforward biography of Augusta Ada King, Countess Lovelace, daughter of the mad poet Lord Byron, and very arguably the first computer programmer. The visual storytelling is expanded by the use of footnotes (which often interact amusingly with the other graphic elements) and extensive endnotes that expand on technical points, or issues and personages contemporary to the main themes. (I read it in iBooks format and the e-text has been set up to allow easy movement between the main panels, the endnotes, and large-text versions of both foot- and endnotes.)But the author, having to her dismay hit the limits of pure biography, due to Lovelace’s tragically short life and Babbage’s failure to actually realize any of his amazing inventions, plunges on sideways into an alternate steampunk universe in which Lovelace and Babbage actually build the analytical engine and use it to…wait for it…fight crime! (And other adventurous pursuits.) Here the story explodes into a mash-up of actual history, deranged tour through the political and literary landscape of mid-19th century Britain, and technical manual.I loved how the story returned to the essentials of steampunk as a genre (as opposed to an artistic aesthetic) in highlighting the exploits of larger-than-life 19th century figures whose dreams and inventive imaginations outstripped the technology of the day. It does not, however, ignore the aesthetic side of steampunk, and aficionados will find all their favorite goggles, Rube-Goldbergian technology, and dashing women in gender-bending historic clothing.Whether you read the central graphic story purely as entertainment, or delve deeply enough into the technical appendices to understand just how Babbage’s engine was intended to work (and the reasons why it was unlikely to have done so), or split the difference by meditating on the ways in which a brilliant mind like Lovelace’s was betrayed and undermined by the age she lived in, this is a book I recommend in the strongest terms."
219,0141981539,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5033966-kaia,5,"First things first, let's get some assumptions out of the way. 1) This book has a lot of footnotes and endnotes. I did not count, but there may be more footnotes/endnotes than actual graphic content. That being said, they are absolutely charming footnotes that I loved reading. Granted, the historical Lovelace is known for translating and annotating a speech by Babbage, where her notes were at least double the size of the original text, which may be intentional.2) This is a graphic novel, but it comes from a web comic so it doesn't have a fully cohesive feel. These are short, episodic stories, but there isn't any sort of overarching plot line.Now, these are two things that I would expect would work against this book, but Padua pulls this all off so charmingly. Here's the story--Charles Babbage is known for designing the first proto-computer, but never actually building one. He struck up a friendship with Ada Lovelace, the daughter of Lord Byron, who learned mathematics from a very young age to try to weaken any ""poetical"" influences from her father (this is a true story). Ada was fascinated by the machine and it's applications, and described how it could be used, including what some consider to be the first computer program. Alas, Lovelace died young and Babbage never built his machine. On a whim, Sydney Padua illustrates this story and ends with a panel wondering what could have been--if Ada lived and Babbage built his machine?This ""What If?"" sends Padua down a deep research hole into the lives of Lovelace and Babbage, and in the end she imagines this alternate (steampunk) universe where a steam computer exists and Lovelace and Babbage get into scrapes and adventures using it. Padua's enthusiasm for the topic and for the friendship between Lovelace and Babbage simply oozes from every page of this book. In the end, this unabashed enthusiasm is what sells the book for me.Many of the footnotes are very funny, comments on sources, on strange things she came across during her research, asides and did you knows about Victorian society (the niche Victorian genre of theological satire using cheese-mites, Uranus originally named George), and an abundance of Victorian lit/math/computer science jokes, with a few cat jokes thrown in for good measure.If you like Kate Beaton's Hark, A Vagrant!, you'll probably like this book. If you're interested in Victoriana or women in STEM or the history of computers or steampunk adventures, you'll probably like this book."
220,0141981539,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43720549-randy-allain,5,"I have never been particularly drawn to the world of graphic novels or web comics, but the premise of mathematical renegades solving problems with a steam-powered Victorian computer convinced me to give this one a try. Sydney Padua's novel starts with a thoughtful biography of Ada King: Countess of Lovelace and daughter of Lord Byron. After explaining that Ada was pushed into mathematics to shelter her from poetry (the “Byron devil”), the book illustrates Ada's affinity for abstract math and her eventual fascination with Charles Babbage's plans for a steam-powered analytical engine. After working extensively with Babbage, obsessively annotating his plans, and writing hypothetical punch-card “programs” for his hypothetical computer, Ada died from cancer at a young age. Babbage never got around to building his analytical engine. Padua was so disappointed in this bitter ending that she constructed a “pocket universe” in which the mathematicians follow-through with their plans to build the engine....hence the, “thrilling adventures.”I would have rated this book a 3 or a 4 based on the comics alone. They were very interesting and the artwork was fantastic – but the comics never quite followed-through with the “thrills” promised in the title. Instead, the thrills came from Padua's impressive empathy for her characters and obsessive research. Not only is her love for the subject matter inspiring, it also provides a great window into the atmosphere of Victorian London. Just about every page of the book is filled with detailed footnotes explaining the historical basis for her characters, jokes, and adventures. All of the information Padua can't fit into the footnotes can be found in extensive endnotes following each adventure and fascinating appendices in which Padua provides her own sketches of the analytical engine (and many of its individual mechanisms) and some of her favorite primary documents. Yes, even the endnotes and appendices have footnotes - and on many occasions the footnotes go meta: they become scattered in explosions, Queen Victoria blocks them out for being too boring, etc. As an English nerd – I couldn't help but give the novel a 5-star rating."
221,0141981539,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11828657-elevetha,4,"!!!!!( http://sydneypadua.com/2dgoggles/wp-c... http://sydneypadua.com/2dgoggles/wp-c... )Now, after reading those delightful panels, who wouldn't want to read this???? I don't know, honestly. Though the book is highly text heavy, it's easy to skip over the historical notes and footnotes, if you prefer to just read the extremely cute and wonderful comics. Me, I read EVERYTHING. I'm not particularly what one would call a history nut, but if you give me background information on why a comment was actually hilarious given the context or how that line of dialogue actually came from a letter sent by Lovelace to ----- or diagrams of the Analytical Engine or anything really in cute little (and not so little) foot and end notes (and appendixes!!), I will be reading all of them.Some of my favorite panels were from The Client:(All the panels above from The Client are all rough comics and look much nicer and different in the book.)But the whole book is really just lovely and hilarious and absurd and beautiful. And as glad as I am that Padua gave readers a background on Lovelace and Babbage and their real life story, (which is drawn so ADORABLY, even when I was practically wailing at how sad it was), I am infinitely more glad that she wrote a version of their lives set in a Pocket Universe that plays out so much better."
222,0141981539,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7706994-harshit-sahay,5,"This is far from a traditional book or even a traditional graphic novel, at least structurally. Hence reading it like one might not be the wisest thing to do. Originally a webcomic, this is a collection of the Adventures of Charles Babbage and Ada Lovelace, in an alternate universe where they were far more successful than our current one. However, Sydney Padua uses the narrative of the universe as merely an excuse to have fun with the 2 central characters and their often glaring flaws, as well as their genius. This creates some nice comedic plots that involve other figures from that age and time as well. Padua uses footnotes as a mechanism of delving into THE ACTUAL history of this duo, providing us with snippets of information that add dimensions to their characters one doesn't really find in schoolbooks. The footnotes help Padua ground the jokes or punch-lines in the comic to incidents in the actual lives of its protagonists in a manner which is extremely elegant. Indeed, a lot of humour is also derived from self-awareness, especially the bits about the ""2-D Goggles"" and the concept of the Pocket Universe. Non-fiction works that deal with subjects in science often have a fatal flaw- a hand-wavy approach to actual science, and an unnecessary focus on often irrelevant details that just appeal more. Padua circumvents that by establishing a completely imaginary world where her imagination can runaway on fantastical adventures with no constraints on reality. However, to her credit, she delves A LOT into the history of the central characters and the world they inhabited in the form of footnotes and endnotes, which provide the reader with exposition and context for the comic, as well as the actual story. This is both incredibly well researched, and also incredibly funny. One can but appreciate the amount of work Sydney Padua put into this, to be able to quote almost any document mentioning either of the two during their lives. This is the best kind of book, one that teaches you things, and does so in a manner that'll leave you in splits."
223,0141981539,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1842352-shomeret,3,"I've been an Ada Lovelace fan for some time. She's one of my historical obsessions. There's something irresistible about Lord Byron's daughter having been a brilliant mathematician who wrote the first computer program. If she had lived longer, who knows what else she might have accomplished. I'll read anything about Ada. This book isn't the first alternate history Ada that I've encountered, but it's definitely the most fun conceptually. It's also the first graphic book I've seen with footnotes and endnotes. Some of the notes are as entertaining as the dialogue and captions. Unfortunately, not all of the content was entertaining. I'm not a mathematician. There are sections of this book that got too technical for me. I skimmed them. I did enjoy parts of this book a great deal, but there were others that I considered a snooze fest."

225,0141981539,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9862074-chris,5,"One part whimsical, pulpy comic and two parts historical anecdotes and footnotes in an amazingly well-designed package, this book is perhaps my favorite version of these stories published. Lovelace & Babbage has appeared previously on the web and (in limited form) in a standalone iPad app, but in this hardcover package it definitely shines. Just from a production standpoint, it stands out; multiple fonts, great layout work, and an incredible cover and dust jacket.Furthermore, there's content in this book that is, I believe, otherwise not available in other formats. I'm not completely sure, but I do not believe I've read the Alice in Wonderland pastiche featured in the final story ""Imaginary Quantities"" anywhere else. Nonetheless it is a standout addition to the L&B canon. In addition, there's some great appendixes with primary source documents (mostly letters from or about Babbage) which sheds some interesting insight into the two protagonists' real lives. There's also a wonderfully illustrated explanation of how the Analytical Engine would look and function.Just about the only thing missing is the major story ""Lovelace & Babbage vs. Organized Crime,"" the eleven part series where our mathematical heroes fight the dastardly plots of organ grinding street performers. But given that that story is probably as long or longer than all the other comics in this work, I can understand why it was left out. Perhaps we'll get a standalone book for that in the future?This collection sits firmly with other fictional-yet-nonfictional works like Logicomix or Action Philosophers. If you're a fan of those books, I genuinely think you'll like this one—and if you liked this one, pick up those other ones! They'll have fewer footnotes, but be just as entertaining and engrossing."

Cartoonist Sydney Padua uses the true story of Charles Babbage and Ada Lovelace as a starting point for her fantastic fictions set in a parallel universe in which the two great thinkers are able to find funding for their magnificent Difference Engine and put it to work in a variety of entertaining and useful ways. Though wildly imaginative, the book is heavily researched and annotated, and you’ll get to see Babbage and Lovelace interact with many familiar names, like Queen Victoria and Charles Dickens, while also learning about some of the era’s less celebrated heroes, such as Isambard Kingdom Brunel.I was fascinated by the story of Babbage and Lovelace, two historical figures I knew next to nothing about, and I particularly enjoyed the detailed footnotes, which filled me in on the historical context of the duo’s adventures. Some of the mathematical equations and scientific theories were a little overwhelming for my English major mind, but Padua presents them in such a playful way that I didn’t feel intimidated. Whether you love science and math or enjoy literature and history, The Thrilling Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage will have something to interest you.- John D.Click here to find the book at the Prince William County Public Library System.

227,0141981539,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5876605-kam-yung-soh,4,"A very entertaining graphic novel about how it might have been if Ada, Countess of Lovelace and Charles Babbage had managed to bring to life the Analytical Engine. The book starts with the real-life stories of Ada and Babbage, then branches off into a 'pocket universe' where the Analytical Engine is created and run by them.In a series of adventures, the pair hilariously show off the Engine to Queen Victoria who wants to 'RULE THE WORLD!', called to save Britain from a global financial crises, fight off the mathematical Luddites, try to mechanise fiction writing by statistically analysing a book by Mary Ann Evans (George Eliot) and even try to visualise the third dimension (remember, the characters live on a two dimensional page).Probably one of the most hilarious short parts of the book is when George Boole (of Boolean logic fame) is reduces to mubbling ""Error, error,"" when asked a non-boolean question (not a ""Yes"" or ""No"" answer) while being served a drink!The book is full of footnotes by the author pointing out historical, mathematical, engineering and computing references to the situations depicted. Making the book more true to life is the effort the author went through to ensure that the words being said in the novel closely match what Ada, Babbage and other characters (like Isambard Kingdom Brunel) actually said or wrote in real life.The book ends with a very technical appendix outlining how Babbage's Analytical Engine would have worked if it actually had been built.A very entertaining read indeed."
228,0141981539,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18850156-stewart-tame,4,"This book was a genuine delight! Inspired by history, Sydney Padua drew a comic strip about Babbage's analytical engine and his relationship with Ada Lovelace. His engine was never built, and Lovelace died young of cancer, so the story doesn't end well. So she added a bit to the end of the strip about how, in another universe, the two went on to build the engine and fight crime. Just a throwaway gag to lighten the mood, make the ending less of a downer. Reaction from the internet was swift, and Padua found herself charged with creating more adventures for her intrepid heroes. And so a legend was born. There's much quirk and charm in this book. There are extensive footnotes, and footnotes to the footnotes--more of these strips are based in fact than might appear at first glance. Don't let the footnotes put you off, though, because there's a breathless enthusiasm to them that makes them a treat to read. Padua is enthusiastic about science and history, and it's contagious. Probably incurable, too. At various times her artwork reminded me of Phil Foglio, Larry Gonick, and even Will Eisner. The footnotes reminded me of Randall Munroe (of xkcd fame.) There's a nice cartoony roundness to her line that makes me smile. This is a marvelous book, particularly if one is a fan of science and/or history and/or steampunk, but even if none of those describe you, you may want to check this book out anyway. Very fun stuff!"
229,0141981539,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63176142-surly,4,"I came across this comic at the Bakken Museum (a small but fun electricity-themed museum in Southwest Minneapolis) and was intrigued by the art, but didn't pick it up, and then checked out a copy from my local library. Now I'm sincerely regretting that I didn't buy it. Padua offers an affectionate portrait of the inventors of the computer (Babbage) and computer programming (Lovelace). While Padua imagines a world where they successfully operate a functioning computer, she bases her flights on a deep reading of the historical record, revealing her principals' personalities and their cultural context in Victorian England. The dialogue is witty and often funny (when not directly borrowed from the principals' correspondence) and supported by legions of footnotes and endnotes that are as entertaining as the images.The art is superb. I loved the character designs and how expressive Padua made them. And she also takes risks with composition, using perspective and page orientation to convey literary and mathematical concepts. For that matter, Padua uses Babbage's original diagrams to sketch out a simplified version of Babbage's unfinished computer, carefully illustrating how processes were accomplished mechanically, offering both visual and written explanations for the reader. It's the rare comic book that engages with both story and an intelligent analysis of the underlying science and history. Highly recommended. "
230,0141981539,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27591228-lapl-reads,4,"Charles Babbage is widely credited with inventing the first computer, depending on your definition of “computer” and “invent”. You see, he never actually finished his masterpiece, the Analytical Engine. Ada Lovelace, the daughter of Lord Byron, was a mathematician who wrote programs for this nascent computer, making her the first computer programmer. Together they were innovators and eccentrics with genuine affection for one another. What could be more fun than a book based on their lives and collaboration? How about a graphic novel based on their story? How about a graphic novel full of extensively researched and annotated science and Victorian history, illustrated with a stylish steampunk flair? The Thrilling Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage is all of this and more. The graphic novel takes their work and lives as a jumping off point and imagines an entire alternate universe where they had the time and means to finish their engine. (In the real world Ada died young and Charles was perpetually trying to pry more money out of the government.) With their analytical engine complete, alternate Lovelace and Babbage can turn to other issues: such as the use of cats in computers, explosions, and fighting crime. This is a fun story, packed full of information, charm, and history.Reviewed by Andrea Borchert, Librarian, Science, Technology & Patents Department"
231,0141981539,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2187833-rach,3,"I love the art and style of this book, and the history of these fascinating people that were so well-known in their own times, yet nearly forgotten in ours. I also love that the author decided to imagine a world in which Lovelace didn't die tragically young, and then went on to have exciting mathematical and mechanical adventures with Babbage.Where this book loses me is in the detailed explanation and analysis of the mathematics and computer science of the analytical machine. It's a lot to wrap your brain around, and after trying very hard to understand and struggling, I was reminded of the fact that I stopped taking computer science courses in college when it got to this point (the theoretical) and I no longer found it enjoyable. At this point in my reading, I decided I didn't want my difficulty in understanding the mathematics to take away from my enjoyment of the art and story, so I started skimming the sciencey bits. I am, in fact, an adult, and can therefore read and not read whatever I want! :PI would especially recommend this book to someone who enjoys and understands computer science, but it is also entertaining on a more surface level for someone like me, who has an interest in computer things and history, despite their lack of technical knowledge (and lack of desire to obtain said knowledge)."
232,0141981539,http://goodreads.com/user/show/79487053-billy,5,"This is a lovely collection of comics, most of them set in an alternate universe in which Babbage completed his Analytical Engine, supplemented by extra information drawn from letters, memoirs and Babbage's own autobiaography. The art is distinctive and fun, and the main characters (Babbage and Lovelace) are joined by others that appear a few times (Brunel and Wellington), and other famous Victorians; scientists, authors and royals alike.The mixing of history, science and fun is delightful, and each is explored more in depth in its own section. The comics themselves are designed to be funny, while the footnotes and endnotes give more detailed information. The first appendix is a compilation of the author's favourite primary sources about Babbage and Lovelace. The second appendix is an explanation of the never built Analytical Machine, complete with diagrams to provide a clear view of the components and working of the machine.Overall this is a fun book that should appeal to those interested in Babbage and Lovelace, who may also enjoy learning about the Analytical Engine."

Loved it. It's not a reference book (as other reviews have complained??) but provides enough background for the curious, and plenty of references if you want to take it further - I'll almost certainly pick up a copy of Babbage's autobiography based on the excepts quoted in this book."
234,0141981539,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29375063-katie-young,5,"Any book that features a 95-year-old Jane Austen who continued to write and eventually grew rich (albeit in one panel and a footnote) deserves high praise in my book. When that book also illuminates my knowledge of important historical (feminist) figures I've only read snippets about elsewhere, it scores more points. When it does so through a comic book form that employs a pocket universe that loops back on itself (both theoretically and narratively) and employs many of the technological wonders and famous figures of nineteenth century Britain in so doing, I marvel at this gem of a unique book that piques so many of my interests that I may need a difference engine to calculate the figure. So much joy! (This is in the running for Just Jane 2020.)"
235,0141981539,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1255121-sardonyx,4,"This was a fascinating foray into the lives in Ada Lovelace and Charles Babbage. I learned a heck of a lot of things that I did not know about either of them. As well as about the planet Uranus. It also made my blood boil at times. Especially when they didn't want to let women learn math. (Brings back memories of scenes from Pretty Woman and her shopping foray).I had not made note of who the author was, but I was picturing it being a woman narrating the whole time. About 3/4 of the way through the book, it occurred to me that it could have been a man and I was pleasantly surprised as my reverse-sexism :D and further delighted to discover it *is* a woman author.

This is a graphic novel--too many words! I expect more pictures telling the story. And all of the footnotes. Just all the footnotes. Nothing ruins your story flow more than 2-3 footnotes a page. I love Ada Lovelace's story, she was fascinating, and the pre-fictional stuff that I did get through was interesting enough, but 3/4 of it could have been either trimmed out or told through images. Too many books to read, not enough time to slog through this. "

The footnotes were frequently in the best Pratchett-esque style, the illustrations were perfectly suited, and I adored the appearance of all sorts of notable figures of the day.Also, the throwaway footnote that in the pocket universe of this book, Jane Austen ""lives to ninety-five and writes dozens of bestselling masterpieces and makes a mint and lives happily ever after"" was in itself enough to win me over (though wholly unnecessary, as this was one of the most charming books I've read in a long time)."

It's both biography and fiction and makes me wonder what would have happened if someone had made Babbage build his engine, though I have a sneaking suspicion that a cattle prod would have been needed.Lovelace would still have died of cancer tho.Made me also think about how good enough is better than never done."

Padua may have lost me a couple of times towards the end, but I never once felt patronised, and came away feeling both entertained and educated. I'm also really fond of her art style, it felt on occasion like a more stylised version of a lot of the illustrations I saw when I was younger, which was unexpectedly nostalgic."

246,0141981539,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8590635-chad,5,"TL;DR Summary: I found this book amazing, inspiring, and perhaps a little magnificent. Having read it, and the author's commentary, it's easy for me to understand how the author found the subject of Ada Lovelace's life so captivating. The remainder of this review is a description of how, and why, it had such a significant impact on me when I read it.For more than a quarter century, I recall thinking at almost all times that I disliked math. I then encountered a math teacher in college, Dr. Blaga Pauley, whose engaging and philosophical teaching style -- which felt more like a conversation about what was most intriguing about math than like formal education -- helped me realize that what I disliked so strongly was not math itself, but the way people seem to think it must be dictated and drilled. Math is, in fact, a beautiful realm of brilliant insights, elegant systems, intricate designs, and the power to create new understanding.I was not (within myself) ready to carry on with math as a more significant pursuit on my own, yet, and a variety of circumstances conspired to keep me from getting the kind of mentorship I needed to reach that readiness. It is difficult to break free from decades of being indoctrinated in the belief that mathematics is a bureaucratic, dreary, tedious field of academic irrelevance, and other (more comfortable, at the time) interests easily distracted me from taking my education in math any further than strictly necessary for all the interests I pursued instead. Even so, the ideas around math as presented by Blaga (before she passed away) stuck with me, and led me to collect a few books for later reading -- a ""later"" that, until now, never came.Along the way, I heard of this book, and someone gave it to me as a gift. Perhaps it was because I asked for it; I don't recall. Time passed, and this year (2019) I finally picked it up and read it. Reading this awoke in me a greater interest in the real-world intellectual adventures of the Countess of Lovelace (the evident originator of general-purpose programming as a field of study and perhaps even the foundation-layer of computer science) and Charles Babbage (the inventor of the Analytical Engine). More significantly for me, perhaps, is the fact this book is what seems to have finally pushed me over the precipice into a plunge into the depths of desire to really learn more about (and seek fuller understanding of) mathematics as a field of exploration rather than simple study. This book has changed my mindset again, like Blaga's instruction did almost twenty years ago, and I rather suspect that when I think back on this in a few years I will be able to say that those two events together have conspired to change my life.I do not know whether this book can help change anyone else's life for the better, but I recommend it without reservation to anyone considering whether it is worth reading. If you hesitated to dedicate time to it before reading this review, hesitate no longer. It really was an amazing experience for me, and I hope it will be for you, too."
247,0141981539,http://goodreads.com/user/show/772327-christopher,4,"Oh my was this fun! I enjoyed the heck out of this book. My daughter enjoyed the heck out of this book. It's clear the author enjoyed the heck out of this book.So the book starts with a historical account of Charles Babbage, Ada Lovelace, and the Difference Engine (and it's progeny the Analytical Engine) - presented in an entertaining storytelling style, complete with footnotes and endnotes - (akin to the Cartoon History of the Universe I, Vol. 1-7: From the Big Bang to Alexander the Great). So far, so good. But this section ends quickly and on a down-note with Lovelace dead of cancer and Babbage unable to get over himself to actually build any of his designs.But as we have seen in so much alternate history from The Difference Engine to Fiddlehead, the idea of a Victorian-era steam-and-cogs computer is just too good to let facts reign and history to have the last say. So Sydney Padua transports us to a pocket universe where the laws of physics are set to maximize entertainment value and the book roars onward, now looking increasingly like Girl Genius, Vol. 1: Agatha Heterodyne and the Beetleburg Clank only with a historically accurate cast of characters instead of a fictional one (well except for Minion the Footman).Oh, and the footnotes continue. Almost every statement uttered by Lovelace, Babbage, or various supporting characters in the book is straight from their own writings or supported with primary documents. And the supporting cast is broad from the Duke of Wellington, to Islambard Kingdom Brunel, to George Eliot, to Lewis Carroll/Charles Dodgson, to Queen Victoria herself. Eventually the footnotes themselves become a character in a Wonderland-inspired investigation into the truth of Ada Lovelace's character and contribution to the Analytical Engine and computer science as a field.And throughout this all, as we watch these absurd Victorian characters and learn about the design of the Analytical Engine and the logic of computing, there's another story being told. The author is able to show us so much about Babbage and Lovelace's personalities and victories because of the triumph of computing. The Google Books project and others like it have opened the world of historical primary sources to interested amateurs like Padua in a way that really has never been possible before. The author is able to wade into decades-old debates with a sharp pen and over-looked sources because of the work of Babbage and Lovelace's intellectual progeny who have continued the drive to organize, collate, and analyze the world's knowledge."
248,0141981539,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27837035-heather-jones,5,"This is a delightfully informative and madcap graphic biography (sort-of) of Ada Lovelace and her relationship with proto-computer inventor Charles Babbage and his research. I found it reminiscent of such genre-fracturing works as Larry Gonick’s The Cartoon History of… series or Scott McCloud’s Understanding Comics in the way it simultaneously uses and subverts the conventions of graphic storytelling to bridge the worlds of education and entertainment. (No doubt there are many other works that do similar things, but I don't actually follow graphic novels much, so these are the ones I thought of.)It begins as a straightforward biography of Augusta Ada King, Countess Lovelace, daughter of the mad poet Lord Byron, and very arguably the first computer programmer. The visual storytelling is expanded by the use of footnotes (which often interact amusingly with the other graphic elements) and extensive endnotes that expand on technical points, or issues and personages contemporary to the main themes. (I read it in iBooks format and the e-text has been set up to allow easy movement between the main panels, the endnotes, and large-text versions of both foot- and endnotes.)But the author, having to her dismay hit the limits of pure biography, due to Lovelace’s tragically short life and Babbage’s failure to actually realize any of his amazing inventions, plunges on sideways into an alternate steampunk universe in which Lovelace and Babbage actually build the analytical engine and use it to…wait for it…fight crime! (And other adventurous pursuits.) Here the story explodes into a mash-up of actual history, deranged tour through the political and literary landscape of mid-19th century Britain, and technical manual.I loved how the story returned to the essentials of steampunk as a genre (as opposed to an artistic aesthetic) in highlighting the exploits of larger-than-life 19th century figures whose dreams and inventive imaginations outstripped the technology of the day. It does not, however, ignore the aesthetic side of steampunk, and aficionados will find all their favorite goggles, Rube-Goldbergian technology, and dashing women in gender-bending historic clothing.Whether you read the central graphic story purely as entertainment, or delve deeply enough into the technical appendices to understand just how Babbage’s engine was intended to work (and the reasons why it was unlikely to have done so), or split the difference by meditating on the ways in which a brilliant mind like Lovelace’s was betrayed and undermined by the age she lived in, this is a book I recommend in the strongest terms."
249,0141981539,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5033966-kaia,5,"First things first, let's get some assumptions out of the way. 1) This book has a lot of footnotes and endnotes. I did not count, but there may be more footnotes/endnotes than actual graphic content. That being said, they are absolutely charming footnotes that I loved reading. Granted, the historical Lovelace is known for translating and annotating a speech by Babbage, where her notes were at least double the size of the original text, which may be intentional.2) This is a graphic novel, but it comes from a web comic so it doesn't have a fully cohesive feel. These are short, episodic stories, but there isn't any sort of overarching plot line.Now, these are two things that I would expect would work against this book, but Padua pulls this all off so charmingly. Here's the story--Charles Babbage is known for designing the first proto-computer, but never actually building one. He struck up a friendship with Ada Lovelace, the daughter of Lord Byron, who learned mathematics from a very young age to try to weaken any ""poetical"" influences from her father (this is a true story). Ada was fascinated by the machine and it's applications, and described how it could be used, including what some consider to be the first computer program. Alas, Lovelace died young and Babbage never built his machine. On a whim, Sydney Padua illustrates this story and ends with a panel wondering what could have been--if Ada lived and Babbage built his machine?This ""What If?"" sends Padua down a deep research hole into the lives of Lovelace and Babbage, and in the end she imagines this alternate (steampunk) universe where a steam computer exists and Lovelace and Babbage get into scrapes and adventures using it. Padua's enthusiasm for the topic and for the friendship between Lovelace and Babbage simply oozes from every page of this book. In the end, this unabashed enthusiasm is what sells the book for me.Many of the footnotes are very funny, comments on sources, on strange things she came across during her research, asides and did you knows about Victorian society (the niche Victorian genre of theological satire using cheese-mites, Uranus originally named George), and an abundance of Victorian lit/math/computer science jokes, with a few cat jokes thrown in for good measure.If you like Kate Beaton's Hark, A Vagrant!, you'll probably like this book. If you're interested in Victoriana or women in STEM or the history of computers or steampunk adventures, you'll probably like this book."
250,0141981539,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43720549-randy-allain,5,"I have never been particularly drawn to the world of graphic novels or web comics, but the premise of mathematical renegades solving problems with a steam-powered Victorian computer convinced me to give this one a try. Sydney Padua's novel starts with a thoughtful biography of Ada King: Countess of Lovelace and daughter of Lord Byron. After explaining that Ada was pushed into mathematics to shelter her from poetry (the “Byron devil”), the book illustrates Ada's affinity for abstract math and her eventual fascination with Charles Babbage's plans for a steam-powered analytical engine. After working extensively with Babbage, obsessively annotating his plans, and writing hypothetical punch-card “programs” for his hypothetical computer, Ada died from cancer at a young age. Babbage never got around to building his analytical engine. Padua was so disappointed in this bitter ending that she constructed a “pocket universe” in which the mathematicians follow-through with their plans to build the engine....hence the, “thrilling adventures.”I would have rated this book a 3 or a 4 based on the comics alone. They were very interesting and the artwork was fantastic – but the comics never quite followed-through with the “thrills” promised in the title. Instead, the thrills came from Padua's impressive empathy for her characters and obsessive research. Not only is her love for the subject matter inspiring, it also provides a great window into the atmosphere of Victorian London. Just about every page of the book is filled with detailed footnotes explaining the historical basis for her characters, jokes, and adventures. All of the information Padua can't fit into the footnotes can be found in extensive endnotes following each adventure and fascinating appendices in which Padua provides her own sketches of the analytical engine (and many of its individual mechanisms) and some of her favorite primary documents. Yes, even the endnotes and appendices have footnotes - and on many occasions the footnotes go meta: they become scattered in explosions, Queen Victoria blocks them out for being too boring, etc. As an English nerd – I couldn't help but give the novel a 5-star rating."

I don't know, honestly. Though the book is highly text heavy, it's easy to skip over the historical notes and footnotes, if you prefer to just read the extremely cute and wonderful comics. Me, I read EVERYTHING. I'm not particularly what one would call a history nut, but if you give me background information on why a comment was actually hilarious given the context or how that line of dialogue actually came from a letter sent by Lovelace to ----- or diagrams of the Analytical Engine or anything really in cute little (and not so little) foot and end notes (and appendixes!!), I will be reading all of them.Some of my favorite panels were from The Client:(All the panels above from The Client are all rough comics and look much nicer and different in the book.)But the whole book is really just lovely and hilarious and absurd and beautiful. And as glad as I am that Padua gave readers a background on Lovelace and Babbage and their real life story, (which is drawn so ADORABLY, even when I was practically wailing at how sad it was), I am infinitely more glad that she wrote a version of their lives set in a Pocket Universe that plays out so much better."
252,0141981539,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7706994-harshit-sahay,5,"This is far from a traditional book or even a traditional graphic novel, at least structurally. Hence reading it like one might not be the wisest thing to do. Originally a webcomic, this is a collection of the Adventures of Charles Babbage and Ada Lovelace, in an alternate universe where they were far more successful than our current one. However, Sydney Padua uses the narrative of the universe as merely an excuse to have fun with the 2 central characters and their often glaring flaws, as well as their genius. This creates some nice comedic plots that involve other figures from that age and time as well. Padua uses footnotes as a mechanism of delving into THE ACTUAL history of this duo, providing us with snippets of information that add dimensions to their characters one doesn't really find in schoolbooks. The footnotes help Padua ground the jokes or punch-lines in the comic to incidents in the actual lives of its protagonists in a manner which is extremely elegant. Indeed, a lot of humour is also derived from self-awareness, especially the bits about the ""2-D Goggles"" and the concept of the Pocket Universe. Non-fiction works that deal with subjects in science often have a fatal flaw- a hand-wavy approach to actual science, and an unnecessary focus on often irrelevant details that just appeal more. Padua circumvents that by establishing a completely imaginary world where her imagination can runaway on fantastical adventures with no constraints on reality. However, to her credit, she delves A LOT into the history of the central characters and the world they inhabited in the form of footnotes and endnotes, which provide the reader with exposition and context for the comic, as well as the actual story. This is both incredibly well researched, and also incredibly funny. One can but appreciate the amount of work Sydney Padua put into this, to be able to quote almost any document mentioning either of the two during their lives. This is the best kind of book, one that teaches you things, and does so in a manner that'll leave you in splits."
253,0141981539,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1842352-shomeret,3,"I've been an Ada Lovelace fan for some time. She's one of my historical obsessions. There's something irresistible about Lord Byron's daughter having been a brilliant mathematician who wrote the first computer program. If she had lived longer, who knows what else she might have accomplished. I'll read anything about Ada. This book isn't the first alternate history Ada that I've encountered, but it's definitely the most fun conceptually. It's also the first graphic book I've seen with footnotes and endnotes. Some of the notes are as entertaining as the dialogue and captions. Unfortunately, not all of the content was entertaining. I'm not a mathematician. There are sections of this book that got too technical for me. I skimmed them. I did enjoy parts of this book a great deal, but there were others that I considered a snooze fest."

Lovelace & Babbage has appeared previously on the web and (in limited form) in a standalone iPad app, but in this hardcover package it definitely shines. Just from a production standpoint, it stands out; multiple fonts, great layout work, and an incredible cover and dust jacket.Furthermore, there's content in this book that is, I believe, otherwise not available in other formats. I'm not completely sure, but I do not believe I've read the Alice in Wonderland pastiche featured in the final story ""Imaginary Quantities"" anywhere else. Nonetheless it is a standout addition to the L&B canon. In addition, there's some great appendixes with primary source documents (mostly letters from or about Babbage) which sheds some interesting insight into the two protagonists' real lives. There's also a wonderfully illustrated explanation of how the Analytical Engine would look and function.Just about the only thing missing is the major story ""Lovelace & Babbage vs. Organized Crime,"" the eleven part series where our mathematical heroes fight the dastardly plots of organ grinding street performers. But given that that story is probably as long or longer than all the other comics in this work, I can understand why it was left out. Perhaps we'll get a standalone book for that in the future?This collection sits firmly with other fictional-yet-nonfictional works like Logicomix or Action Philosophers. If you're a fan of those books, I genuinely think you'll like this one—and if you liked this one, pick up those other ones! They'll have fewer footnotes, but be just as entertaining and engrossing."

Cartoonist Sydney Padua uses the true story of Charles Babbage and Ada Lovelace as a starting point for her fantastic fictions set in a parallel universe in which the two great thinkers are able to find funding for their magnificent Difference Engine and put it to work in a variety of entertaining and useful ways. Though wildly imaginative, the book is heavily researched and annotated, and you’ll get to see Babbage and Lovelace interact with many familiar names, like Queen Victoria and Charles Dickens, while also learning about some of the era’s less celebrated heroes, such as Isambard Kingdom Brunel.I was fascinated by the story of Babbage and Lovelace, two historical figures I knew next to nothing about, and I particularly enjoyed the detailed footnotes, which filled me in on the historical context of the duo’s adventures. Some of the mathematical equations and scientific theories were a little overwhelming for my English major mind, but Padua presents them in such a playful way that I didn’t feel intimidated. Whether you love science and math or enjoy literature and history, The Thrilling Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage will have something to interest you.- John D.Click here to find the book at the Prince William County Public Library System.

257,0141981539,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5876605-kam-yung-soh,4,"A very entertaining graphic novel about how it might have been if Ada, Countess of Lovelace and Charles Babbage had managed to bring to life the Analytical Engine. The book starts with the real-life stories of Ada and Babbage, then branches off into a 'pocket universe' where the Analytical Engine is created and run by them.In a series of adventures, the pair hilariously show off the Engine to Queen Victoria who wants to 'RULE THE WORLD!', called to save Britain from a global financial crises, fight off the mathematical Luddites, try to mechanise fiction writing by statistically analysing a book by Mary Ann Evans (George Eliot) and even try to visualise the third dimension (remember, the characters live on a two dimensional page).Probably one of the most hilarious short parts of the book is when George Boole (of Boolean logic fame) is reduces to mubbling ""Error, error,"" when asked a non-boolean question (not a ""Yes"" or ""No"" answer) while being served a drink!The book is full of footnotes by the author pointing out historical, mathematical, engineering and computing references to the situations depicted. Making the book more true to life is the effort the author went through to ensure that the words being said in the novel closely match what Ada, Babbage and other characters (like Isambard Kingdom Brunel) actually said or wrote in real life.The book ends with a very technical appendix outlining how Babbage's Analytical Engine would have worked if it actually had been built.A very entertaining read indeed."
258,0141981539,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18850156-stewart-tame,4,"This book was a genuine delight! Inspired by history, Sydney Padua drew a comic strip about Babbage's analytical engine and his relationship with Ada Lovelace. His engine was never built, and Lovelace died young of cancer, so the story doesn't end well. So she added a bit to the end of the strip about how, in another universe, the two went on to build the engine and fight crime. Just a throwaway gag to lighten the mood, make the ending less of a downer. Reaction from the internet was swift, and Padua found herself charged with creating more adventures for her intrepid heroes. And so a legend was born. There's much quirk and charm in this book. There are extensive footnotes, and footnotes to the footnotes--more of these strips are based in fact than might appear at first glance. Don't let the footnotes put you off, though, because there's a breathless enthusiasm to them that makes them a treat to read. Padua is enthusiastic about science and history, and it's contagious. Probably incurable, too. At various times her artwork reminded me of Phil Foglio, Larry Gonick, and even Will Eisner. The footnotes reminded me of Randall Munroe (of xkcd fame.) There's a nice cartoony roundness to her line that makes me smile. This is a marvelous book, particularly if one is a fan of science and/or history and/or steampunk, but even if none of those describe you, you may want to check this book out anyway. Very fun stuff!"
259,0141981539,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63176142-surly,4,"I came across this comic at the Bakken Museum (a small but fun electricity-themed museum in Southwest Minneapolis) and was intrigued by the art, but didn't pick it up, and then checked out a copy from my local library. Now I'm sincerely regretting that I didn't buy it. Padua offers an affectionate portrait of the inventors of the computer (Babbage) and computer programming (Lovelace). While Padua imagines a world where they successfully operate a functioning computer, she bases her flights on a deep reading of the historical record, revealing her principals' personalities and their cultural context in Victorian England. The dialogue is witty and often funny (when not directly borrowed from the principals' correspondence) and supported by legions of footnotes and endnotes that are as entertaining as the images.The art is superb. I loved the character designs and how expressive Padua made them. And she also takes risks with composition, using perspective and page orientation to convey literary and mathematical concepts. For that matter, Padua uses Babbage's original diagrams to sketch out a simplified version of Babbage's unfinished computer, carefully illustrating how processes were accomplished mechanically, offering both visual and written explanations for the reader. It's the rare comic book that engages with both story and an intelligent analysis of the underlying science and history. Highly recommended. "
260,0141981539,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27591228-lapl-reads,4,"Charles Babbage is widely credited with inventing the first computer, depending on your definition of “computer” and “invent”. You see, he never actually finished his masterpiece, the Analytical Engine. Ada Lovelace, the daughter of Lord Byron, was a mathematician who wrote programs for this nascent computer, making her the first computer programmer. Together they were innovators and eccentrics with genuine affection for one another. What could be more fun than a book based on their lives and collaboration? How about a graphic novel based on their story? How about a graphic novel full of extensively researched and annotated science and Victorian history, illustrated with a stylish steampunk flair? The Thrilling Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage is all of this and more. The graphic novel takes their work and lives as a jumping off point and imagines an entire alternate universe where they had the time and means to finish their engine. (In the real world Ada died young and Charles was perpetually trying to pry more money out of the government.) With their analytical engine complete, alternate Lovelace and Babbage can turn to other issues: such as the use of cats in computers, explosions, and fighting crime.

I also love that the author decided to imagine a world in which Lovelace didn't die tragically young, and then went on to have exciting mathematical and mechanical adventures with Babbage.Where this book loses me is in the detailed explanation and analysis of the mathematics and computer science of the analytical machine. It's a lot to wrap your brain around, and after trying very hard to understand and struggling, I was reminded of the fact that I stopped taking computer science courses in college when it got to this point (the theoretical) and I no longer found it enjoyable. At this point in my reading, I decided I didn't want my difficulty in understanding the mathematics to take away from my enjoyment of the art and story, so I started skimming the sciencey bits. I am, in fact, an adult, and can therefore read and not read whatever I want! :PI would especially recommend this book to someone who enjoys and understands computer science, but it is also entertaining on a more surface level for someone like me, who has an interest in computer things and history, despite their lack of technical knowledge (and lack of desire to obtain said knowledge)."

The art is distinctive and fun, and the main characters (Babbage and Lovelace) are joined by others that appear a few times (Brunel and Wellington), and other famous Victorians; scientists, authors and royals alike.The mixing of history, science and fun is delightful, and each is explored more in depth in its own section. The comics themselves are designed to be funny, while the footnotes and endnotes give more detailed information. The first appendix is a compilation of the author's favourite primary sources about Babbage and Lovelace. The second appendix is an explanation of the never built Analytical Machine, complete with diagrams to provide a clear view of the components and working of the machine.Overall this is a fun book that should appeal to those interested in Babbage and Lovelace, who may also enjoy learning about the Analytical Engine."

Loved it. It's not a reference book (as other reviews have complained??) but provides enough background for the curious, and plenty of references if you want to take it further - I'll almost certainly pick up a copy of Babbage's autobiography based on the excepts quoted in this book."

When that book also illuminates my knowledge of important historical (feminist) figures I've only read snippets about elsewhere, it scores more points. When it does so through a comic book form that employs a pocket universe that loops back on itself (both theoretically and narratively) and employs many of the technological wonders and famous figures of nineteenth century Britain in so doing, I marvel at this gem of a unique book that piques so many of my interests that I may need a difference engine to calculate the figure.

Especially when they didn't want to let women learn math. (Brings back memories of scenes from Pretty Woman and her shopping foray).I had not made note of who the author was, but I was picturing it being a woman narrating the whole time.

Padua may have lost me a couple of times towards the end, but I never once felt patronised, and came away feeling both entertained and educated.

276,0141981539,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8590635-chad,5,"TL;DR Summary: I found this book amazing, inspiring, and perhaps a little magnificent. Having read it, and the author's commentary, it's easy for me to understand how the author found the subject of Ada Lovelace's life so captivating. The remainder of this review is a description of how, and why, it had such a significant impact on me when I read it.For more than a quarter century, I recall thinking at almost all times that I disliked math. I then encountered a math teacher in college, Dr. Blaga Pauley, whose engaging and philosophical teaching style -- which felt more like a conversation about what was most intriguing about math than like formal education -- helped me realize that what I disliked so strongly was not math itself, but the way people seem to think it must be dictated and drilled. Math is, in fact, a beautiful realm of brilliant insights, elegant systems, intricate designs, and the power to create new understanding.I was not (within myself) ready to carry on with math as a more significant pursuit on my own, yet, and a variety of circumstances conspired to keep me from getting the kind of mentorship I needed to reach that readiness. It is difficult to break free from decades of being indoctrinated in the belief that mathematics is a bureaucratic, dreary, tedious field of academic irrelevance, and other (more comfortable, at the time) interests easily distracted me from taking my education in math any further than strictly necessary for all the interests I pursued instead. Even so, the ideas around math as presented by Blaga (before she passed away) stuck with me, and led me to collect a few books for later reading -- a ""later"" that, until now, never came.Along the way, I heard of this book, and someone gave it to me as a gift. Perhaps it was because I asked for it; I don't recall. Time passed, and this year (2019) I finally picked it up and read it. Reading this awoke in me a greater interest in the real-world intellectual adventures of the Countess of Lovelace (the evident originator of general-purpose programming as a field of study and perhaps even the foundation-layer of computer science) and Charles Babbage (the inventor of the Analytical Engine). More significantly for me, perhaps, is the fact this book is what seems to have finally pushed me over the precipice into a plunge into the depths of desire to really learn more about (and seek fuller understanding of) mathematics as a field of exploration rather than simple study. This book has changed my mindset again, like Blaga's instruction did almost twenty years ago, and I rather suspect that when I think back on this in a few years I will be able to say that those two events together have conspired to change my life.I do not know whether this book can help change anyone else's life for the better, but I recommend it without reservation to anyone considering whether it is worth reading. If you hesitated to dedicate time to it before reading this review, hesitate no longer. It really was an amazing experience for me, and I hope it will be for you, too."
277,0141981539,http://goodreads.com/user/show/772327-christopher,4,"Oh my was this fun! I enjoyed the heck out of this book. My daughter enjoyed the heck out of this book. It's clear the author enjoyed the heck out of this book.So the book starts with a historical account of Charles Babbage, Ada Lovelace, and the Difference Engine (and it's progeny the Analytical Engine) - presented in an entertaining storytelling style, complete with footnotes and endnotes - (akin to the Cartoon History of the Universe I, Vol. 1-7: From the Big Bang to Alexander the Great). So far, so good. But this section ends quickly and on a down-note with Lovelace dead of cancer and Babbage unable to get over himself to actually build any of his designs.But as we have seen in so much alternate history from The Difference Engine to Fiddlehead, the idea of a Victorian-era steam-and-cogs computer is just too good to let facts reign and history to have the last say. So Sydney Padua transports us to a pocket universe where the laws of physics are set to maximize entertainment value and the book roars onward, now looking increasingly like Girl Genius, Vol. 1: Agatha Heterodyne and the Beetleburg Clank only with a historically accurate cast of characters instead of a fictional one (well except for Minion the Footman).Oh, and the footnotes continue. Almost every statement uttered by Lovelace, Babbage, or various supporting characters in the book is straight from their own writings or supported with primary documents. And the supporting cast is broad from the Duke of Wellington, to Islambard Kingdom Brunel, to George Eliot, to Lewis Carroll/Charles Dodgson, to Queen Victoria herself. Eventually the footnotes themselves become a character in a Wonderland-inspired investigation into the truth of Ada Lovelace's character and contribution to the Analytical Engine and computer science as a field.And throughout this all, as we watch these absurd Victorian characters and learn about the design of the Analytical Engine and the logic of computing, there's another story being told. The author is able to show us so much about Babbage and Lovelace's personalities and victories because of the triumph of computing. The Google Books project and others like it have opened the world of historical primary sources to interested amateurs like Padua in a way that really has never been possible before. The author is able to wade into decades-old debates with a sharp pen and over-looked sources because of the work of Babbage and Lovelace's intellectual progeny who have continued the drive to organize, collate, and analyze the world's knowledge."
278,0141981539,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27837035-heather-jones,5,"This is a delightfully informative and madcap graphic biography (sort-of) of Ada Lovelace and her relationship with proto-computer inventor Charles Babbage and his research. I found it reminiscent of such genre-fracturing works as Larry Gonick’s The Cartoon History of… series or Scott McCloud’s Understanding Comics in the way it simultaneously uses and subverts the conventions of graphic storytelling to bridge the worlds of education and entertainment. (No doubt there are many other works that do similar things, but I don't actually follow graphic novels much, so these are the ones I thought of.)It begins as a straightforward biography of Augusta Ada King, Countess Lovelace, daughter of the mad poet Lord Byron, and very arguably the first computer programmer. The visual storytelling is expanded by the use of footnotes (which often interact amusingly with the other graphic elements) and extensive endnotes that expand on technical points, or issues and personages contemporary to the main themes. (I read it in iBooks format and the e-text has been set up to allow easy movement between the main panels, the endnotes, and large-text versions of both foot- and endnotes.)But the author, having to her dismay hit the limits of pure biography, due to Lovelace’s tragically short life and Babbage’s failure to actually realize any of his amazing inventions, plunges on sideways into an alternate steampunk universe in which Lovelace and Babbage actually build the analytical engine and use it to…wait for it…fight crime! (And other adventurous pursuits.) Here the story explodes into a mash-up of actual history, deranged tour through the political and literary landscape of mid-19th century Britain, and technical manual.I loved how the story returned to the essentials of steampunk as a genre (as opposed to an artistic aesthetic) in highlighting the exploits of larger-than-life 19th century figures whose dreams and inventive imaginations outstripped the technology of the day. It does not, however, ignore the aesthetic side of steampunk, and aficionados will find all their favorite goggles, Rube-Goldbergian technology, and dashing women in gender-bending historic clothing.Whether you read the central graphic story purely as entertainment, or delve deeply enough into the technical appendices to understand just how Babbage’s engine was intended to work (and the reasons why it was unlikely to have done so), or split the difference by meditating on the ways in which a brilliant mind like Lovelace’s was betrayed and undermined by the age she lived in, this is a book I recommend in the strongest terms."
279,0141981539,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5033966-kaia,5,"First things first, let's get some assumptions out of the way. 1) This book has a lot of footnotes and endnotes. I did not count, but there may be more footnotes/endnotes than actual graphic content. That being said, they are absolutely charming footnotes that I loved reading. Granted, the historical Lovelace is known for translating and annotating a speech by Babbage, where her notes were at least double the size of the original text, which may be intentional.2) This is a graphic novel, but it comes from a web comic so it doesn't have a fully cohesive feel. These are short, episodic stories, but there isn't any sort of overarching plot line.Now, these are two things that I would expect would work against this book, but Padua pulls this all off so charmingly. Here's the story--Charles Babbage is known for designing the first proto-computer, but never actually building one. He struck up a friendship with Ada Lovelace, the daughter of Lord Byron, who learned mathematics from a very young age to try to weaken any ""poetical"" influences from her father (this is a true story). Ada was fascinated by the machine and it's applications, and described how it could be used, including what some consider to be the first computer program. Alas, Lovelace died young and Babbage never built his machine. On a whim, Sydney Padua illustrates this story and ends with a panel wondering what could have been--if Ada lived and Babbage built his machine?This ""What If?"" sends Padua down a deep research hole into the lives of Lovelace and Babbage, and in the end she imagines this alternate (steampunk) universe where a steam computer exists and Lovelace and Babbage get into scrapes and adventures using it. Padua's enthusiasm for the topic and for the friendship between Lovelace and Babbage simply oozes from every page of this book. In the end, this unabashed enthusiasm is what sells the book for me.Many of the footnotes are very funny, comments on sources, on strange things she came across during her research, asides and did you knows about Victorian society (the niche Victorian genre of theological satire using cheese-mites, Uranus originally named George), and an abundance of Victorian lit/math/computer science jokes, with a few cat jokes thrown in for good measure.If you like Kate Beaton's Hark, A Vagrant!, you'll probably like this book. If you're interested in Victoriana or women in STEM or the history of computers or steampunk adventures, you'll probably like this book."
280,0141981539,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43720549-randy-allain,5,"I have never been particularly drawn to the world of graphic novels or web comics, but the premise of mathematical renegades solving problems with a steam-powered Victorian computer convinced me to give this one a try. Sydney Padua's novel starts with a thoughtful biography of Ada King: Countess of Lovelace and daughter of Lord Byron. After explaining that Ada was pushed into mathematics to shelter her from poetry (the “Byron devil”), the book illustrates Ada's affinity for abstract math and her eventual fascination with Charles Babbage's plans for a steam-powered analytical engine. After working extensively with Babbage, obsessively annotating his plans, and writing hypothetical punch-card “programs” for his hypothetical computer, Ada died from cancer at a young age. Babbage never got around to building his analytical engine. Padua was so disappointed in this bitter ending that she constructed a “pocket universe” in which the mathematicians follow-through with their plans to build the engine....hence the, “thrilling adventures.”I would have rated this book a 3 or a 4 based on the comics alone. They were very interesting and the artwork was fantastic – but the comics never quite followed-through with the “thrills” promised in the title. Instead, the thrills came from Padua's impressive empathy for her characters and obsessive research. Not only is her love for the subject matter inspiring, it also provides a great window into the atmosphere of Victorian London. Just about every page of the book is filled with detailed footnotes explaining the historical basis for her characters, jokes, and adventures. All of the information Padua can't fit into the footnotes can be found in extensive endnotes following each adventure and fascinating appendices in which Padua provides her own sketches of the analytical engine (and many of its individual mechanisms) and some of her favorite primary documents. Yes, even the endnotes and appendices have footnotes - and on many occasions the footnotes go meta: they become scattered in explosions, Queen Victoria blocks them out for being too boring, etc. As an English nerd – I couldn't help but give the novel a 5-star rating."

I don't know, honestly. Though the book is highly text heavy, it's easy to skip over the historical notes and footnotes, if you prefer to just read the extremely cute and wonderful comics. Me, I read EVERYTHING. I'm not particularly what one would call a history nut, but if you give me background information on why a comment was actually hilarious given the context or how that line of dialogue actually came from a letter sent by Lovelace to ----- or diagrams of the Analytical Engine or anything really in cute little (and not so little) foot and end notes (and appendixes!!), I will be reading all of them.Some of my favorite panels were from The Client:(All the panels above from The Client are all rough comics and look much nicer and different in the book.)But the whole book is really just lovely and hilarious and absurd and beautiful. And as glad as I am that Padua gave readers a background on Lovelace and Babbage and their real life story, (which is drawn so ADORABLY, even when I was practically wailing at how sad it was), I am infinitely more glad that she wrote a version of their lives set in a Pocket Universe that plays out so much better."
282,0141981539,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7706994-harshit-sahay,5,"This is far from a traditional book or even a traditional graphic novel, at least structurally. Hence reading it like one might not be the wisest thing to do. Originally a webcomic, this is a collection of the Adventures of Charles Babbage and Ada Lovelace, in an alternate universe where they were far more successful than our current one. However, Sydney Padua uses the narrative of the universe as merely an excuse to have fun with the 2 central characters and their often glaring flaws, as well as their genius. This creates some nice comedic plots that involve other figures from that age and time as well. Padua uses footnotes as a mechanism of delving into THE ACTUAL history of this duo, providing us with snippets of information that add dimensions to their characters one doesn't really find in schoolbooks. The footnotes help Padua ground the jokes or punch-lines in the comic to incidents in the actual lives of its protagonists in a manner which is extremely elegant. Indeed, a lot of humour is also derived from self-awareness, especially the bits about the ""2-D Goggles"" and the concept of the Pocket Universe. Non-fiction works that deal with subjects in science often have a fatal flaw- a hand-wavy approach to actual science, and an unnecessary focus on often irrelevant details that just appeal more. Padua circumvents that by establishing a completely imaginary world where her imagination can runaway on fantastical adventures with no constraints on reality. However, to her credit, she delves A LOT into the history of the central characters and the world they inhabited in the form of footnotes and endnotes, which provide the reader with exposition and context for the comic, as well as the actual story. This is both incredibly well researched, and also incredibly funny. One can but appreciate the amount of work Sydney Padua put into this, to be able to quote almost any document mentioning either of the two during their lives. This is the best kind of book, one that teaches you things, and does so in a manner that'll leave you in splits."

There's something irresistible about Lord Byron's daughter having been a brilliant mathematician who wrote the first computer program. If she had lived longer, who knows what else she might have accomplished. I'll read anything about Ada. This book isn't the first alternate history Ada that I've encountered, but it's definitely the most fun conceptually. It's also the first graphic book I've seen with footnotes and endnotes. Some of the notes are as entertaining as the dialogue and captions. Unfortunately, not all of the content was entertaining. I'm not a mathematician. There are sections of this book that got too technical for me. I skimmed them. I did enjoy parts of this book a great deal, but there were others that I considered a snooze fest."

Lovelace & Babbage has appeared previously on the web and (in limited form) in a standalone iPad app, but in this hardcover package it definitely shines. Just from a production standpoint, it stands out; multiple fonts, great layout work, and an incredible cover and dust jacket.Furthermore, there's content in this book that is, I believe, otherwise not available in other formats. I'm not completely sure, but I do not believe I've read the Alice in Wonderland pastiche featured in the final story ""Imaginary Quantities"" anywhere else. Nonetheless it is a standout addition to the L&B canon. In addition, there's some great appendixes with primary source documents (mostly letters from or about Babbage) which sheds some interesting insight into the two protagonists' real lives. There's also a wonderfully illustrated explanation of how the Analytical Engine would look and function.Just about the only thing missing is the major story ""Lovelace & Babbage vs. Organized Crime,"" the eleven part series where our mathematical heroes fight the dastardly plots of organ grinding street performers. But given that that story is probably as long or longer than all the other comics in this work, I can understand why it was left out. Perhaps we'll get a standalone book for that in the future?This collection sits firmly with other fictional-yet-nonfictional works like Logicomix or Action Philosophers. If you're a fan of those books, I genuinely think you'll like this one—and if you liked this one, pick up those other ones! They'll have fewer footnotes, but be just as entertaining and engrossing."

Cartoonist Sydney Padua uses the true story of Charles Babbage and Ada Lovelace as a starting point for her fantastic fictions set in a parallel universe in which the two great thinkers are able to find funding for their magnificent Difference Engine and put it to work in a variety of entertaining and useful ways. Though wildly imaginative, the book is heavily researched and annotated, and you’ll get to see Babbage and Lovelace interact with many familiar names, like Queen Victoria and Charles Dickens, while also learning about some of the era’s less celebrated heroes, such as Isambard Kingdom Brunel.I was fascinated by the story of Babbage and Lovelace, two historical figures I knew next to nothing about, and I particularly enjoyed the detailed footnotes, which filled me in on the historical context of the duo’s adventures. Some of the mathematical equations and scientific theories were a little overwhelming for my English major mind, but Padua presents them in such a playful way that I didn’t feel intimidated.

287,0141981539,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5876605-kam-yung-soh,4,"A very entertaining graphic novel about how it might have been if Ada, Countess of Lovelace and Charles Babbage had managed to bring to life the Analytical Engine. The book starts with the real-life stories of Ada and Babbage, then branches off into a 'pocket universe' where the Analytical Engine is created and run by them.In a series of adventures, the pair hilariously show off the Engine to Queen Victoria who wants to 'RULE THE WORLD!', called to save Britain from a global financial crises, fight off the mathematical Luddites, try to mechanise fiction writing by statistically analysing a book by Mary Ann Evans (George Eliot) and even try to visualise the third dimension (remember, the characters live on a two dimensional page).Probably one of the most hilarious short parts of the book is when George Boole (of Boolean logic fame) is reduces to mubbling ""Error, error,"" when asked a non-boolean question (not a ""Yes"" or ""No"" answer) while being served a drink!The book is full of footnotes by the author pointing out historical, mathematical, engineering and computing references to the situations depicted. Making the book more true to life is the effort the author went through to ensure that the words being said in the novel closely match what Ada, Babbage and other characters (like Isambard Kingdom Brunel) actually said or wrote in real life.The book ends with a very technical appendix outlining how Babbage's Analytical Engine would have worked if it actually had been built.A very entertaining read indeed."
288,0141981539,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18850156-stewart-tame,4,"This book was a genuine delight! Inspired by history, Sydney Padua drew a comic strip about Babbage's analytical engine and his relationship with Ada Lovelace. His engine was never built, and Lovelace died young of cancer, so the story doesn't end well. So she added a bit to the end of the strip about how, in another universe, the two went on to build the engine and fight crime. Just a throwaway gag to lighten the mood, make the ending less of a downer. Reaction from the internet was swift, and Padua found herself charged with creating more adventures for her intrepid heroes. And so a legend was born. There's much quirk and charm in this book. There are extensive footnotes, and footnotes to the footnotes--more of these strips are based in fact than might appear at first glance. Don't let the footnotes put you off, though, because there's a breathless enthusiasm to them that makes them a treat to read. Padua is enthusiastic about science and history, and it's contagious. Probably incurable, too. At various times her artwork reminded me of Phil Foglio, Larry Gonick, and even Will Eisner. The footnotes reminded me of Randall Munroe (of xkcd fame.) There's a nice cartoony roundness to her line that makes me smile. This is a marvelous book, particularly if one is a fan of science and/or history and/or steampunk, but even if none of those describe you, you may want to check this book out anyway. Very fun stuff!"
289,0141981539,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63176142-surly,4,"I came across this comic at the Bakken Museum (a small but fun electricity-themed museum in Southwest Minneapolis) and was intrigued by the art, but didn't pick it up, and then checked out a copy from my local library. Now I'm sincerely regretting that I didn't buy it. Padua offers an affectionate portrait of the inventors of the computer (Babbage) and computer programming (Lovelace). While Padua imagines a world where they successfully operate a functioning computer, she bases her flights on a deep reading of the historical record, revealing her principals' personalities and their cultural context in Victorian England. The dialogue is witty and often funny (when not directly borrowed from the principals' correspondence) and supported by legions of footnotes and endnotes that are as entertaining as the images.The art is superb. I loved the character designs and how expressive Padua made them. And she also takes risks with composition, using perspective and page orientation to convey literary and mathematical concepts. For that matter, Padua uses Babbage's original diagrams to sketch out a simplified version of Babbage's unfinished computer, carefully illustrating how processes were accomplished mechanically, offering both visual and written explanations for the reader. It's the rare comic book that engages with both story and an intelligent analysis of the underlying science and history. Highly recommended. "
290,0141981539,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27591228-lapl-reads,4,"Charles Babbage is widely credited with inventing the first computer, depending on your definition of “computer” and “invent”. You see, he never actually finished his masterpiece, the Analytical Engine. Ada Lovelace, the daughter of Lord Byron, was a mathematician who wrote programs for this nascent computer, making her the first computer programmer. Together they were innovators and eccentrics with genuine affection for one another. What could be more fun than a book based on their lives and collaboration? How about a graphic novel based on their story? How about a graphic novel full of extensively researched and annotated science and Victorian history, illustrated with a stylish steampunk flair? The Thrilling Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage is all of this and more. The graphic novel takes their work and lives as a jumping off point and imagines an entire alternate universe where they had the time and means to finish their engine. (In the real world Ada died young and Charles was perpetually trying to pry more money out of the government.) With their analytical engine complete, alternate Lovelace and Babbage can turn to other issues: such as the use of cats in computers, explosions, and fighting crime. This is a fun story, packed full of information, charm, and history.Reviewed by Andrea Borchert, Librarian, Science, Technology & Patents Department"
291,0141981539,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2187833-rach,3,"I love the art and style of this book, and the history of these fascinating people that were so well-known in their own times, yet nearly forgotten in ours. I also love that the author decided to imagine a world in which Lovelace didn't die tragically young, and then went on to have exciting mathematical and mechanical adventures with Babbage.Where this book loses me is in the detailed explanation and analysis of the mathematics and computer science of the analytical machine. It's a lot to wrap your brain around, and after trying very hard to understand and struggling, I was reminded of the fact that I stopped taking computer science courses in college when it got to this point (the theoretical) and I no longer found it enjoyable. At this point in my reading, I decided I didn't want my difficulty in understanding the mathematics to take away from my enjoyment of the art and story, so I started skimming the sciencey bits. I am, in fact, an adult, and can therefore read and not read whatever I want! :PI would especially recommend this book to someone who enjoys and understands computer science, but it is also entertaining on a more surface level for someone like me, who has an interest in computer things and history, despite their lack of technical knowledge (and lack of desire to obtain said knowledge)."
292,0141981539,http://goodreads.com/user/show/79487053-billy,5,"This is a lovely collection of comics, most of them set in an alternate universe in which Babbage completed his Analytical Engine, supplemented by extra information drawn from letters, memoirs and Babbage's own autobiaography. The art is distinctive and fun, and the main characters (Babbage and Lovelace) are joined by others that appear a few times (Brunel and Wellington), and other famous Victorians; scientists, authors and royals alike.The mixing of history, science and fun is delightful, and each is explored more in depth in its own section. The comics themselves are designed to be funny, while the footnotes and endnotes give more detailed information. The first appendix is a compilation of the author's favourite primary sources about Babbage and Lovelace. The second appendix is an explanation of the never built Analytical Machine, complete with diagrams to provide a clear view of the components and working of the machine.Overall this is a fun book that should appeal to those interested in Babbage and Lovelace, who may also enjoy learning about the Analytical Engine."
293,0141981539,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17639930-oya,5,"What I expected when I picked up this book: Cute, fun, alt-history adventure comics about Charles Babbage and Ada, Countess of Lovelace.What I got: Cute, fun, alt-history adventure comics about Charles Babbage and Ada, Countess of Lovelace, with EXTENSIVE footnotes, references and appendices giving the real history, interesting anecdotes, and context, with entertaining appearances by other notable figures of the day (or thereabouts - it *is* still playing with alternate timelines) like Brunell and George Eliot. Loved it. It's not a reference book (as other reviews have complained??) but provides enough background for the curious, and plenty of references if you want to take it further - I'll almost certainly pick up a copy of Babbage's autobiography based on the excepts quoted in this book."
294,0141981539,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29375063-katie-young,5,"Any book that features a 95-year-old Jane Austen who continued to write and eventually grew rich (albeit in one panel and a footnote) deserves high praise in my book. When that book also illuminates my knowledge of important historical (feminist) figures I've only read snippets about elsewhere, it scores more points. When it does so through a comic book form that employs a pocket universe that loops back on itself (both theoretically and narratively) and employs many of the technological wonders and famous figures of nineteenth century Britain in so doing, I marvel at this gem of a unique book that piques so many of my interests that I may need a difference engine to calculate the figure. So much joy! (This is in the running for Just Jane 2020.)"
295,0141981539,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1255121-sardonyx,4,"This was a fascinating foray into the lives in Ada Lovelace and Charles Babbage. I learned a heck of a lot of things that I did not know about either of them. As well as about the planet Uranus. It also made my blood boil at times. Especially when they didn't want to let women learn math. (Brings back memories of scenes from Pretty Woman and her shopping foray).I had not made note of who the author was, but I was picturing it being a woman narrating the whole time. About 3/4 of the way through the book, it occurred to me that it could have been a man and I was pleasantly surprised as my reverse-sexism :D and further delighted to discover it *is* a woman author. "
296,0141981539,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8109706-erikka,1,"It's not very often I ""TL:DR"" a book, especially after just happily reading a 600-page tome, but TL:DR. This is a graphic novel--too many words! I expect more pictures telling the story. And all of the footnotes. Just all the footnotes. Nothing ruins your story flow more than 2-3 footnotes a page. I love Ada Lovelace's story, she was fascinating, and the pre-fictional stuff that I did get through was interesting enough, but 3/4 of it could have been either trimmed out or told through images. Too many books to read, not enough time to slog through this. "
297,0141981539,http://goodreads.com/user/show/118558-sarah,5,"This was delightful, hilarious, ridiculous, and generally, all-around awesome. The footnotes were frequently in the best Pratchett-esque style, the illustrations were perfectly suited, and I adored the appearance of all sorts of notable figures of the day.Also, the throwaway footnote that in the pocket universe of this book, Jane Austen ""lives to ninety-five and writes dozens of bestselling masterpieces and makes a mint and lives happily ever after"" was in itself enough to win me over (though wholly unnecessary, as this was one of the most charming books I've read in a long time)."
298,0141981539,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11513-deirdre,4,"Most excellent, even if I did start to lose my attention when the actual mechanics of the Difference or Analytical Engine started, I'm a true user, no real interest in how it works, I care about the output. It's both biography and fiction and makes me wonder what would have happened if someone had made Babbage build his engine, though I have a sneaking suspicion that a cattle prod would have been needed.Lovelace would still have died of cancer tho.Made me also think about how good enough is better than never done."
299,0141981539,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17851759-amy-r,4,"I know next to nothing about maths, and not a great deal about early Victorian society and culture- this book proved to be a whirlwind introduction to both, along with a fascinating glimpse into the author's head and what exactly she found interesting in her research. Padua may have lost me a couple of times towards the end, but I never once felt patronised, and came away feeling both entertained and educated. I'm also really fond of her art style, it felt on occasion like a more stylised version of a lot of the illustrations I saw when I was younger, which was unexpectedly nostalgic."
