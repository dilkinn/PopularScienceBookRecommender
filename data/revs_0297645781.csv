1,0297645781,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3980606-marie-delos-reyes,2,"I've started reading this last year, and finally, I'm done with it. Not that the book is not good at all, I was just ""too busy"" with school stuff. Well, it really was a very informative experience reading this one. I enjoyed reading the history of maths; the author succeeded in making a rather boring topic into such a humorous, interesting piece that can easily be understood. I wish I had read this earlier, probably when I was still in high school. I might be able to appreciate more our math subjects if I had read this prior to taking those subjects. But, anyway, yeah, the book's very educational. I give only two stars to this book because, though there's no doubt that the pieces of math information was laid out very well, I was really disappointed with how the story turned out. When I started reading this, I became excited when the gang (Mr. Ruche and Perette's family) was faced with a mystery. I thought, 'hey, this will be exciting', what with all the detective stuff they'll gonna do and such. But turns out it will just be a very long review of the history of mathematics. The detective stuff, well, only occupied just a veeeery small fraction of the whole story. I even got more disappointed with the ending. I can't find the exact words to tell how I felt with the ending of the story but.. I really didn't like it. "
2,0297645781,http://goodreads.com/user/show/457796-stephanie,4,"I have a million different feelings about this book, so I'm just going to dump them here, all sort of stream of consciousness (hopefully my friends will forgive me). 1) The translation to English seemed very poor, even taking into account that it's been translated into very English, English. 2) A lot of this seemed to be taken verbatim from Professor Guedj's lecture notes. I wonder if I could turn my lecture notes into an international best seller? It appears from the liner notes that Guedj actually offers a class on that. 3) How come I never knew that the Arab world basically made all the contributions to mathematics during the dark ages? 4) How lame is this plot? 5) Why does this book make me want to re-take the SATs? OK, I'll stop now. "
3,0297645781,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91255374-kostas-skourtis,5,The story of mathematics with a novel touch.
4,0297645781,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5106403-jean-fran-ois,4,"This is not the first story I read that revolves around mathematics, but this is surely the first one that goes that deep into the history. The style is nice and easy to read, the presentation concise and efficient, it is a really pleasure to read. A star was removed for the ending. I think the author could have done a better job in the conclusion. Overall, pleasant book to read, a good introduction to the vast history of math for people who don't know it yet. "
5,0297645781,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18235175-loony-schulte,5,This the perfect book for sb you loves math and the perfect book for sb who don´t.The characters are so different and lovable that reading through this history of math compendium is done in the blink of an eye.Really outstanding topic and the story is just the frame for more and more and more smaller stories.One of the best books I ever read.
6,0297645781,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28411487-ilona,2,"Mixed opinion. I would have given one star to the main story (so many clichés, coincidences...) but the history of mathematics was interesting (3 or 4 stars).Au point de vue fiction, c'était mauvais, ce qui explique pourquoi j'ai de nombreuses fois hésité à l'abandonner. Toutefois, la partie instructive, c-à-d la partie ""histoire des mathématiques"" était intéressante."
7,0297645781,http://goodreads.com/user/show/565673-nicholas-whyte,3,http://nwhyte.livejournal.com/2824398.htmlA fictional Sophie's World type of story about three children and a retired bookseller discovering the history of mathematics. There is a rather ridiculous plot involving Fermat's Last Theorem and gangsters who operate between Brazil and Sicily. It possibly reads better in the original French.
8,0297645781,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5089155-roberta,5,"This book should be a compulsory read for every child approaching mathematics for the first time. It really shows the interesting/funny side of maths which suddenly make sense! I wish I had read this when I was 11, my life would have been different."
9,0297645781,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29756603-krisz,1,"I'd give even less stars than 1 if I could. It's horrible. It says in the blurb: for people who hate maths but love reading - and I have to say I probably shouldn't have read the book since I love maths and reading too.1) The story isn't written well. It irked from the beginning that the reader isn't told from the beginning that the boy and the old man are in the same household, for example. Or that after G's letter everybody with a half brain can find out who that someone is who knows the theorem by heart. The seances where old Ruche tells the kids about maths are cheesy. The whole Italian guy at the end is unrealistic.2) The maths part is not clear-cut. Thales's theorem is explained in a dialogie of 20 or so pages. Duh! Some stuff is overexplained, others are just put there but no explanation, no solution. The book ends with one question answered but doesn't say anything whether the other one (Goldbach's theorem) is answered at all in today's maths world...This book made me itchy, nervous and mad. My family couldn't wait for me to finish!"
10,0297645781,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47021487-jose-moa,4,"There are few novels where the plot is about mathematics,i only know two : The uncle Petros and the Goldbach Conjecture ad this one.This is a rather fun novel, where a parisien Ruche a old book seller with a odd family receive a big old histhoric books library from a friend in Manaos and a strange parrot.Arround this a series of facts happen ,and this all is used as a pretext for to expose several mathematical concepts and develop a histhory of mathematics,from egiptians and babilonians till the 19 century,across of greek,arabian and renacentist mathematics,with a lot of anecdotes.The book also makes mention of the proof of the last Fermat theorem by Andrew Wiles.A valuable, fun and interesting novel for those with some interes in mathematics"
11,0297645781,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1286888-stan,3,"This is a hard book to review. Ostensibly a history of mathematics inserted in a mild mystery, it is hard to pigeonhole. The mathematics discussions seem authentic enough (I.e. I couldn't follow most of them. The main characters are almost comic bookish. They alternate between silly, wise ass dialogs that kids would find charming along.w technical.discussions way above my ability. The characters were mostly displayed in the weirdest qualities. I could never figure out who the author is taking too, because there are some themes and language not suitable for kids. Still, somehow I found myself sort of enjoying its 500 pages. One saving grace is that the French is really charming."
12,0297645781,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71776708-noctalli,4,"THE MATHEMATICS CONCEPTS in this book were very easy to understand, even though I haven't studied all of them. At that, the author really did a great job in allowing any reader to study, comprehend and understand the basics of the most important questions and actors in the history of mathematics. It also helped that I'm interested in it and that I find science fascinating, but I'm positive anyone could enjoy this novel, no matter how awful their past history with mathematics...This will definitely be a useful reader for next year, my last before graduating high school, and I'll probably need to dive back into it sooner or later."
13,0297645781,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44730650-dincay-akcoren,5,A book explaining history of mathematics through a story taking place in modern days.High school mathematics is more than enough to follow the mathematical terms and concepts in the book. The story is not sophisticated but there are some twists and mysteries that keep the excitement high. Philosophical discussions about mathematics are also good.The mathematics of Ancient Greece are discussed in detail however as years increase mathematics get more complicated and only concepts and headlines are given.Overall a very good book that mixes math into a modern story.
14,0297645781,http://goodreads.com/user/show/89566823-kaue,3,"This book was quite informative but after some time reading it I got bored — that explains why it took me maybe a month to read it — cause most of the time they were talking about mathematics and the plot is only a small percentage of the whole book. I think it's important for me to highlight that it's not a low quality bad book. By the way, the mathematics history is told in a very creative way. If you like historical book and maths that's the way to go!"
15,0297645781,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27475923-asimenia-phantasmagoria,3,"3/5 actually...The idea of combining math history with a mystery is excellent. I agree with those who say that ""Parrot's theorem"" is for maths what ""Sophie's world"" is for philosophy. Both are books full of references that motivate the reader to search more and expand his/her/its horizons. Also, the descriptions of places in Paris are enjoyable. All in all, I believe that the writer had a nice initial idea but he sacrificed characters' depth and plot building for math history. "
16,0297645781,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5870020-charles,3,"A truly unique and wonderful reading experience. Of course, it helps to have a bit of math background (which I do not) or at least interest. This is a history of mathematics set up through a whodunit structure, an insoluble mystery perhaps, but with some very charming characters and locale. The English translation seems to zip along smoothly."
17,0297645781,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56584576-katherine-psy,3,Nice book but hard to keep on reading because of the complex writing and lot of mathematics that could be more easily explained...
18,0297645781,http://goodreads.com/user/show/103431877-foteini,4,Starting by trying to remember all that Maths from highschool. Finishing by thinking that Mathematics is the language of nature..

20,0297645781,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42191310-demitra,3,3.5/5 I know it was supposed to be about maths but since it is literature i wanted to see character development throughout the book instead of forcing it in the end of it.
21,0297645781,http://goodreads.com/user/show/97804515-katherina-savino,3,"The book is very nice if you are passionate about mathematics, otherwise it can result a bit too specific and boring in some parts."
22,0297645781,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9563913-despina-inwhirlofinspiration,5,"Oh this book was in my reading list for ages {opening brackets- 6 years ago, in high school, a little piece of paper with the name of this book slipped in my wallet. The mission was to read this book. The inspiration was my high- school's mathematician. He is Santa Claus' best replica and he's always surrounded by a haze made of his passion about maths, the stories behing the equations and astronomy stories. He will try to infuse all these directly in your brain and if you are smart enough to appreciate them you will be a happy person for the rest of your life. For the record, he could be the main hero of the book too. Thanks so much for everything mr. D. D.! -closing brackets} to read this book. and now that I'm done reading it, I wish there was more of it.A fascinating tour within the territory of the crest of the sciences, combined harmonically with a crime/detective novel. Maths unfold magically in front of your eyes, so that in the end you realize that what is really wonderful with numbers, is inside them. Such a beautiful and simple idea.Moreover Denis gives us the most apt explanation of a collector's-famous art thief's perversion, which art pieces can't be shown to anybody. So contrary to, the braggart castaway, who flounders on a small island with Cindy Crawford and has nobody to share this, the paranoid villain of the novel tells us that: ""To possess something and keep it hidden is like... making love with the most beautiful girl in the village and meeting her the other day in the crowd and greeting her respectfully like she's a total stranger."" As a collector of various things I find myself to be identified with him sometimes. The pleasure of owning something that nobody know is invaluable.So, 5 stars from the tip of my heart since this book was so much than enternaining!"
23,0297645781,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30492138-mehmet-din,3,I would have given 3.5 for that book. 4 is much and 3 is not enough considering the informative story line.To split this book into 2 pieces:1-History of science starting from ancient greek. 4 points2-Construction of fiction. 3 pointsIt's always better to learn history while enjoying it but that book might be a bit tiresome. Story could have been unpredictable to keep reader more passionate.
24,0297645781,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47354-dave,5,"A fabulous book combining intrigue, philosophy and highlights of the history of mathematics. I read this book out loud to my family, who all enjoyed it. Great characters, an engaging mysterious plot and exciting anecdotes on the history of maths."
25,0297645781,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5089155-roberta,5,"This book should be a compulsory read for every child approaching mathematics for the first time.

26,0297645781,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17184075-julian,2,"Basically a thin veneer of fiction on top of a recapitulation of the history of mathematics. I wanted to like this more than I did, but it wasn't bad. Maybe someone who hasn't heard all the same anecdotes a hundred times would get more out of it."
27,0297645781,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6226665-brian-baker,4,"As 'Sophie's World' is to philosophy so is this to mathematics, and the relative popularity of these two subjects is perhaps the reason for the disparity in fame between the two works. Deserves to be better known."
28,0297645781,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3749396-mysteredgar,3,"A nice book if you would like to learn some things about the history of mathematics. I can't say that I was impressed by neither the plot or the the way the book was written, but I can say that it was interesting and a fine summer reading."
29,0297645781,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5648811-alexandra,5,"if you love maths like i do then you are bound to love it..its a great pleasure to read about almost every mathematician and his life,his ambitions and what he has discovered..however,if you find that maths are boring then dont even give it a try,you wil hate it"
30,0297645781,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32809-anne,4,"Sophie's World in mathematics. And although I love philosophy more than I will ever love maths, I enjoyed this book a lot more than I ever will Sophie's World."
31,0297645781,http://goodreads.com/user/show/202331-anna,4,Very nice book explaining Math rules in nice and not over intellecualized way. And the story is good. 
32,0297645781,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1001728-eric,3,An enjoyable but pretty bland walk through (some of) the history of math. I'd hoped I would enjoy this more than I did.
33,0297645781,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2429623-rharvan,5,What can I say... I love math and reading - and so any book that combines both well makes it to the top of my list.
34,0297645781,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2047825-lindig,5,"What a charming story, and what a great way to learn (and even understand) the history of mathematics."
35,0297645781,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4301508-ifyasaiso,4,Most fantastic gift from my grandfather ever! Great to read when you should be studying.
36,0297645781,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5348644-neville-ridley-smith,4,Great fun history of mathematics wrapped in a decent enough story.
37,0297645781,http://goodreads.com/user/show/801676-teri-peterson,3,"There's a LOT of math in this book, but the storyline is fairly engaging. I guessed the answer to the mystery about halfway through, but was intrigued by a subplot I hadn't guessed."
38,0297645781,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6002484-julio-c,0,Bien.
39,0297645781,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7039542-victoria-victoria,3,nice history of maths.
40,0297645781,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36107396-ton-van-gessel,5,It's a teenage adventure book. But its over 30 years ago I was a teenager and I liked it. In the course of solving a mystery you are guided through the history of mathematics. 
41,0297645781,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37665263-rodanthi-pi,5,One of my very fanourite books!!!
42,0297645781,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38253478-karolina,4,"Really catchy book, for people who are interested in maths furtherly, and for those who want to expand their knowledge beyond their own expectations. Like me."
43,0297645781,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3558664-paul,4,"I found this story slightly hard to read, maybe because of the translation. But it had some pretty interesting content about the history maths."
44,0297645781,http://goodreads.com/user/show/259224-kamlapati-khalsa,2,"Cool story, great elementary math lessons, but not particularly well written. It could be just a poor translation."
45,0297645781,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5985927-eduardo-cruz,3,"I have mixed feelings about this book. Although it's an interesting take on math, it falls flat in a large portion of the story and, at the end, I can't help but feel like it's an unfinished work."
46,0297645781,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11869836-achilleas,5,my favorite book about mathematics and how close they're related to life. must-read.
