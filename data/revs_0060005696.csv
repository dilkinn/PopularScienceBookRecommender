0,0060005696,http://goodreads.com/user/show/215673-cameron,4,"Maybe I don't read enough Psychology, but I thought this book was fantastic. Swarthmore Psychology professor Barry Schwartz's basic thesis is that the world is divided into two types of person: maximizers, who want to find the absolute best option, and satisficers who want to find something that is good enough and not worry that something better might be out there. He also links maximizing to the high and increasing incidence of clinical depression in the developed world and believes that satisficing is the best option for coping in a world in which we are overwhelmed with choice.He also introduces a bunch of other interesting topics:Hedonic Adaptation - Whatever we enjoy and that makes us happy, we will adapt to and thus derive less pleasure from in subsequent experiences. The law of diminishing returns restated in psychological terms.Satisfaction Treadmill - We also become adapted to a certain level of satisfaction, so that once we have experienced a certain level of satisfaction, a previous level of satisfaction will actually make us less happy than before. This is apparently not very well developed research, which is how I felt about it.Choosing Choice - Individuals will always choose to have more options (I'd rather have 30 types of wine to choose from rather than 6), but are actually made happier when there are less options. In the previous example, those presented with only 6 options were far more likely to buy than those presented with 30, and they also experienced far higher satisfaction with their purchase. This is the behavior that leads to the overwhelming range of options we face in modern life. Another interesting example: 65% of people who didn't have cancer said that if they got it, they would want to choose their treatment; of those who actually had cancer, 88% said they would not prefer to choose. In other words, our perception of what we would want from a choice standpoint is not the same thing as what we actually want when we get there.The Peak-End Rule of Satisfaction - Our satisfaction with an experience is defined by two key components: the peak of the experience, good or bad, and the end of the experience, good or bad. So a mediocre vacation with an amazing peak and conclusion will be remembered in retrospect as more satisfying than a vacation that was consistently good but never great. (Daniel Kahneman)Salience and Availability - When making decisions, the salience (how conspicuous or vivid a data point is) and availability of our situation matters greatly. This is why people judge murders and airline crashes to be far more common causes of death than traffic accidents and strokes; we hear far more about the former two, and in far more graphic terms, than we do about the latter. People were far more affected by a video testimonial, even when warned in advance that this was a highly atypical case, than they were by a solid set of research data.Framing and Anchoring - What your anchor point is for a decision matters. People are much happier getting a discount for paying cash than they are paying a surcharge for using a credit card. This is because our satisfaction is not derived in a linear manner; $200 is not twice as good as $100, the resultant satisfaction drops off. Once again, the law of diminishing returns, but related to satisfaction. Here's a great set of questions: 1) Would you rather have $100, or the option to flip a coin to get $200 on heads or nothing on tails? 2) Would you rather lose $100 or have the option to flip a coin and lose $200 on heads or nothing on tails? From an economics standpoint, there should be no difference in any of these options, but 95% of respondents choose the sure $100 (because $200 is not twice as good as $100 from a satisfaction standpoint) and they choose the option to flip for the $200 loss or nothing (because a $200 loss is not twice as bad as a $100 loss). Pretty trippy. I've tried this with a bunch of folks, and everyone seems to answer according to this pattern.Sunk Costs - People have a hard time letting go of sunk costs from a satisfaction standpoint. Say you have bought tickets to see a good music group, but then a horrible snowstorm hits and you will have to walk to get there and you hate the cold. From an economics standpoint, the money you paid for the tickets is already gone, so you should just make your decision about whether or not to go based on how happy you think your decision will make you. But people have a very hard time accepting this, and are more likely to follow a course that will make them unhappy because they already spent the money.Regret - Maximizers are far more likely to experience regret than satisficers, because they are always susceptible to learning at a later date that a decision they made was actually not the absolute best choice they could have made. Not surprisingly, regret is highly correlated with unhappiness and depression. The author speculates that the large number of maximizers in the general population is related to the fact that we are evolutionarily ill-equipped to deal with the range of choice we face today, and that this was a far more useful personality trait prior to the last several hundred years. Schwartz says that there are two main factors that affect regret: 1) Do we consider ourselves to have personal responsibility for the result (I crashed the car vs. I was blindsided); 2) Can we imagine a counterfactual alternative (I could have worked harder in college to get a better job vs. the economy is horrible and no one is making any money).Learned Helplessness - In a somewhat disturbing series of experiments, Martin Seligman showed that you can teach rats to learn how to not adapt to environmental changes that harm them (electric shocks, in this case). This concept of learned helplessness is common in unhappy and depressed people, and is largely based on what we attribute our successes or failures to. Depression and Social Networks - A society that lauds autonomy also -- maybe unintentionally -- encourages the dissolution of social networks, which are one of the best defenses against depression, because they prescribe all sorts of constraints for us that limit the range of choices we have to make. Reversible Decisions - People generally prefer to have the option to undo or reverse a decision (such as a purchase), but in actuality we end up less satisfied with a reversible decision than an irreversible decision. The author speculates that this is part of the issue with divorce rates (marriage is now more of a reversible decision than in the past) and other social issues we face. He suggests that we can find greater satisfaction in life by accepting some decisions as irreversible, even if society tells us otherwise.Evaluating an Experience - We evaluate experiences on four dimensions:1. Comparing the experience to what we hoped it would be2. Comparing the experience to what we expected it would be3. Comparing the experience to other experiences we have had in the past4. Comparing the experience to experiences have had"
1,0060005696,http://goodreads.com/user/show/261589-jeff,1,"The Paradox of Choice is a 236 page treatises on why too much choice can be debilitating. It can be summed up in its sub-sub-title: ""Why the Culture of Abundance Robs Us of Satisfaction."" (Why a book needs a sub-title under the sub-title beats me). The problem is that we spend too much time and energy trying to make choices that in the grand scheme of things don't matter that much. I agree with the big idea, but I hated the book and here's why: Schwartz could have made his point in a fine three page article, we don't need 236 pages of examples to get the idea. Yeah, there is too much choice, and we need to spend quality time making the choices that matter like where to work and who to be in a commited relationship with, and less time picking out what cereal to buy. So you get the gist. Make the right choice and leave this book on the shelf."
2,0060005696,http://goodreads.com/user/show/163809-edward,4,"Really important book for me. Refers to some great research. Some highlights:Prologue:- “choice no longer liberates, but debilitates” -“choice overload”- we’d be better off if we embraced some limits on choice instead of rebelling, by seeking “good enough” rather than the best, by lowering our expectations about our decisions, by making our decisions nonreversible, and by not comparing ourselves to others as much  I. When We Choose1. Let’s Go Shopping- 30% of people bought from the small sample of jams, only 3% bought from the large sample (those buying from small sample were more satisfied)2. New Choices- healthcare, beauty, religion- 65% say they would choose own treatment if got cancer, but only 12% actually do this- work is unconstrained by what your parents’ did or geography: a 34 YO has already worked for 9 companies- in fact staying with a job doesn’t show loyalty, but a lack of ambition. II. How We Choose3. Deciding and Chooosing- experienced, expected, and remembered utility rarely line up faithfully- Kahneman et. al.’s remembering utility by “peak-end” rule (people preferred noise that ended less unpleasantly even though maximal unpleasantness lasted longer)- people rated ""colonoscopy plus"" as less unpleasant than rival (even effected 5-year follow ups)- James Twichell: “Ads are what we know about the world around us”.- availability heuristic (we think there are more words that start with “t” than have it has 3rd letter)- saliency: people are swayed by vivid video on how police are even when told it is atypical case- people think accidents kill as many as diseases (though latter kill 16x more), homicide = strokes (latter kills 11x more); dramatic deaths overestimated (and this correlated with newspaper coverage).- a chooser thinks about consequences, values, and can create choices or refuse to make any; a picker just hopes for the best4. When Only the Best Will Do- maximizers seek and accept only the best, which is a difficult decision strategy when there are many options; satisfacers are ok with “good enough”- Herbert Simon (who coined the term) thought that satisfizing was the maximizing strategy - maximizers savor the positive less and do not cope as well as satis., take longer to recover from bad stuff, are not as happy/satisfied with life, more pessimistic, more regret, and more depressed (extreme max. score=borderline clinical depression).- “buyer’s remorse” diminishes satisfaction with choice made and can be anticipatory- many choices+maximizing=unhappiness III. Why We Suffer5. Choice and Happiness- “Choice is what enables us to tell the world who we are and what we care about”; has expressive value - close social relations are most important for happiness (though decreases autonomy)- the less barriers to autonomy we have, the more disturbing the remaining ones are- income affects happiness only until people stop being poor (tested by looking at different countries at the same time and the same country at different times).- happy people can attract others and being with others can make people happy- it takes time for form close connections, to maintain them- rules, standards, and routines can be good- we are drawn to people who meet our standards, and than we stick with them out of routine (we don’t think about it everyday)6. Missed Opportunities- economics says we should only consider opportunity costs of next-best alternative (so if soccer costs $3 and bball is next best alternative, the total cost of soccer is $3 plus missing out on bball)- participants chose the safer more expensive car, rather than the cheaper and more dangerous one regardless of price- 75% of MD’s tried a med instead of referring to specialist, however 50% referred instead of choice of 2 meds (a way of avoiding a decision). - negatives stand out more than positives - neg. emotions makes for bad decisions and vice versa (candy made residents faster and more accurate diagnoses).- students offered 6 topics more likely wrote essays & they were better than those offered 30 topics- students exposed to 30 chocolates liked them less & would rather take $ instead more often than those exposed to 6- people marry 5 years later than a generation ago, and people stay half as long at jobs- evolution may have only prepared us to separate good from bad, not better from best (a ala Nozick)- people want to be able to reverse decisions, however few do, and those that have the option are less satisfied (the former put more psychological work into making things OK)7. The Problem of Regret- postdecison (buyer’s reget makes things less enjoyable) and predecison (which can paralyze)-bronze medalists are happier than silver medalists (near misses hurt more)- people rarely say “things could be worse” (gratitude), they usually see how things could be better (can inspire) sunk costs: coaches also give more time to high paid players irrespective of performance8. The Problem of Adaptation- we get used to things and take them for granted and people don’t anticipate this- 1973: 13% of Americans thought AC in cars was a necessity, today: 41%.- lottery winners not more happier and accident victims were still pretty happy-adaptation can be good in a world of misery - hedonic and satisfaction treadmills 9. Why Everything Suffers from Comparison- comparisons to: what you hoped/expected, other experiences, other people’s experiences- “the curse of discernment”- poor teens talked about benefits of internet, rich teens talked about drawbacks- upward comparisons to others is bad a lot (though can inspire), downward comparisons can boost self-esteem, increase positive mood, and reduce anxiety- when cancer patients encountered other cancer patients in good shape they felt better- only compare to people in our “pond” where we have good chances of being successful (this was necessarily the case before) - most respondants choose better relative position over absolute position with IQs- happy people were minimally affected by other’s skill at the anagram task, they were not affected by feedback given to their partner (unlike unhappy people); the former can distract & move on, the latter ruminate (all this pertains to maximizers vs. satisfisers as well which is paradoxical as “the best” should be independent of how others are doing)10. Choice, Disappointment, and Depression - Seligman: you’ll get depressed at failure/loss of control that is attributed in a personal, persistent, and pervasive way (as opposed to global, transient, and specific attribution); “optimists” do the latter with failure and the former with success, “pessimists” do the opposite - suicide is second leading cause of death (after accidents) among US High School and College students; rate among College students has tripled in last 35 years- it matters if failure is our fault (Americans buy 50 million diet books per year and spend more than $50 billion on dieting); ultathin cultures have women that are double as depressed as men- unattainable expectations + tendancy to take personal responsibility = badness IV. What We Can Do11. What to Do About Choice(1) Choose when to choose- costs are subtle and cumulative; focus on subjective, not objective- You could make a rule to visit no more than 2 stores when shopping for clothes or to consider no more than 2 destinations when considering a vacation (2) Be a chooser, not a picker- choosers reflect on what makes a decision important, whether even none of the options should be chosen, or a new option created, and the expressive value of a choice; pickers are passive selectors from what is available- shorten or eliminate fuss about unimportant decisions, use freed up time to reflect on what you want, think about what options would need to be created (if so) (3) Satisfice more and maximize less (4) Think about the opportunity costs of opportunity costs- a “good investment” for a satisficer may be one that returns more than inflation. Period. (5) Make your decisions nonreversible- I’m simply not going there, I’ve made my decision so this option has nothing to do with me. I’m out of the market, so end of story- you can pour your energy instead into improving the relationship, rather than second-guessing it (6) Practice an “attitude of gratitude”- the same experience can have delightful and disappointing aspects and its up to us what we focus on- everyday list 5 things that happened which you are grateful for (you may be surprised) (7) Regret Less- practice gratitude for what is good in a decision rather than focusing on bad (8) Anticipate adaptation- develop realistic expectations about how experiences change with time and how we satisfied with only higher levels of experience over time (the double wammy) (9) Control expectations- remove excessively high ones, allow for serendipity (10) Curtail social comparison- learning that good enough is good enough will automatically reduce social comparison- focus on what makes you happy and what gives meaning to your life (11) Learn to love constraints- they can be liberating this choice overload context- following rules can free up time/energy for situations where rules don’t work"
3,0060005696,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16227957-chloe,1,"The premise of this book did interest me. What I thought was going to be a book that analyzed how the abundances of choice or at least the appearance of choice affects our perception of freedom, satisfaction, and enjoyment, turned out to be a repetitive book that sounds like an older guy complaining why there are so many different types of beans in the supermarket.""I just want a can of beans! Why are there so many types! Just give me beans!""Honestly, at one point he does appear to bemoan the variety of beans that are available in the common supermarket. Not really the kind of abundance of choice I was expecting to be inhibiting our every day lives. He goes on to provide more anecdotes about how hard he is finding it to adjust to so much choice now available in the modern market place. He describes the agony of picking out a pair of jeans, since there are so many different cuts available since clothing designers have figured out that there is more than one body type.And it is his approach to buying jeans that honestly made me loose respect in his approach to the whole subject of choice. What he does is he sees that there are so many different cuts, he can't decide, therefor he buys all the different types, tries them on at home to figure out which one work for him. And there I was thinking, ""Isn't that what dressing rooms are for?"" He just made the whole process more convoluted and difficult than necessary, which made me think what other concepts did he just add an unnecessary level of complexity to.I really find it hard to think that it is better for a clothing store to ignore different body types and to just make clothes that fits one ideal body type to make one shopping experience easier. The truth is, everyone has to go through finding out the cut of jeans that work best for you, and then after that point, you just remember and pick the cut you know fits you after that experience. Someone really doesn't reevaluate and try on all the different cuts every single time they go to buy jeans. Just like people know their size, people know their cut. Unless there is a size 6 who tries sizes 0 - 14 only to realize that a size 6 still is the size that fits her the best.He even tried to argue that having more than one place to vacation to was a bad thing. That deciding made the experiences significantly less enjoyable. I don't know about him but once I have decided and I am on vacation, I don't really think about where I could have been but where I am currently. A vacation is a vacation, it is kind of hard to ruin them.This author could have made very valid points, but many times the anecdotes he provided made him sound like a confused, annoyed aging man who wants things to be like the good old days, his examples and scenarios weren't good at all (picking out beans, buying jeans, or where to go on a vacation, etc), and also he would provide very little evidence to back up the claims that choice was making us more miserable."
4,0060005696,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2294090-darwin8u,4,"“Learning to choose is hard. Learning to choose well is harder. And learning to choose well in a world of unlimited possibilities is harder still, perhaps too hard.” ― Barry Schwartz, The Paradox of Choice: Why More Is Less A solid survey of the behavioral economics literature related to the premise that the wide range of choices we have (what to read, how to read it, what rating to give it, where to post our review) actually ends up making us unhappier (tyranny of small decisions). Schwartz's summary is similar to a lot of those pop-economic books that seem to pop up regularly and sell quite well because they both tell us something we kinda already suspected, but also gently surprise us with counter-intuitive ideas at the same time. We are surprised, we are also a little validated: just little bit of supply with a very light touch demand. This book belongs snug on the bookshelf next to: anything by Malcolm Gladwell, Freakonomics, Predictably Irrational, Nudge, Mistakes Were Made (But Not by Me), etc. All interesting, all worth the time (as long as the time is < 5 hrs), but none of them are brilliant. They are all Gladwell-like in their reductionism (this is why they all sell so well to the business community and are pimped heavily by Forbes to TED). I am both attracted and repelled by the form. They seem to span the fissure between academic and pop, between economics and self-help. I read them and I end up feeling like I know a bit more about myself, and NOW I'm just disappointed in that bastard for a couple more rational reasons.___A side note. I believe behavioral economics was invented to get economists laid. It got them hanging out with more psychology and sociology majors and well, there you go*. It reminds me of a joke my econ professor used to tell us. ""What does an economist use for birth control? His personality.""* see Malcolm 'the horndog' Gladwell above."
5,0060005696,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1725471-gordon,5,"This is one of those books that, once you've read it, permanently shifts your perspective. It made me think altogether differently about the value of having MORE choices. As the author argues, your sense of well-being increases when you go from having no choices to having a few choices. But as you go from having a few choices to having many choices, your happiness typically goes down. Why? Because it's time-consuming and stressful to choose between all those alternatives! You become fearful of making a mistake, of not making the absolute best choice. And often the more time you spend making that perfect choice, the more unhappy you are second-guessing yourself after the fact. Did I make a mistake? How to get out of this dilemma? Limit your choices to a handful that satisfy your criteria. Then stop adding more alternatives. Make your selection as quickly as you can given the available information and the importance of the decision. Buying a house warrants careful consideration and lots of time. Buying a coffee-maker does not.This may sound kind of self-evident, but can be extraordinarily difficult to put into practice, whether it has to do with choosing mates or picking a university to attend. The book is well-supported by lots of experimental evidence. Well worth reading. Highly recommended."
6,0060005696,http://goodreads.com/user/show/575806-kressel-housman,4,"I first heard of this book from a friend, who explained it in terms of dating. In the span of time between her first date with her husband and the day they finally got married, she had married and divorced someone else. Why? Because when he first met her, he couldn’t decide. There were so many other women available he was afraid of missing out on “the right one” and wanted to try out more options. That is the paradox of choice. The more options that are available, the harder it is to decide.All of that seemed perfectly logical to me, but until I read this book, I didn’t think it applied to me. I’m not indecisive. But what I discovered after reflecting on what I learned from this book is that I’m a decision avoider. Unlike my friend’s husband, I’m not apt to try out many options. I don’t shop around. As a matter of fact, I barely shop at all. And while this does simplify things, it’s not a balanced approach either.The book makes the distinction between maximizers, people who shop around to find the best possible option, and satisficers, people who settle for “good enough.” It’s better to be a satisficer than a maximizer, and I did test closer to satisficer on the quiz (what good self-help book doesn’t have at least one?), but because regret over past decisions is a maximizer trait that looms large in my life, I’ve been forced to conclude that I’m a satisficer in food, clothing, and entertainment, but a maximizer over the big deal decisions of my life: education, career, relationships, and child-rearing. As I’ve said in other reviews, one of the main reasons I want to go to graduate school is that I want a second chance at the college dream I bungled so badly the first time. I don’t enroll because I can’t afford to, but my job seems all the more boring as a result because I keep thinking that graduate school would be a better use of my time and talents. Goodreads is my continuing education, of course, but it doesn’t entirely satisfice while I’m at my job. I’d rather be reading or writing for Goodreads.The book does give advice on how to become more of a satisficer, and though it’s solid advice, it wasn’t anything I didn’t already know. Basically, the advice is two-fold. First, practice an “attitude of gratitude” so that you’ll see the good in what you have. And second, since the idea that you’re missing out on some better option is a product of the imagination, imagine options that could be worse than the one you’re in. After all, those happen, too.But you know what? I just can’t give up hope that there’s something better out there. Imagining worse is what keeps me from seeking change, but that’s fear. I’m as paralyzed as my friend’s husband was. This, the book says, is regret aversion. I have it big time.So all in all, this was not a “feel good” self-help book. It’s made me see my faults more clearly, and at the moment anyway, it hasn’t given me any new skills. Still, the points rang true, so if awareness is the first step, hopefully, I’m on the right path. May Hashem send solutions to us all."

He could have said everything he needed to say in a few-page article, and it's pretty redundant. But it's still a really quick read so what's the harm...There are so many things in here that are so interesting and apply to tons of situations and decisions every day. Things that people constantly do to themselves without thinking, and could be so much happier if they knew they were doing it. I am basically recommending that everyone I know read this book; not all of it is going to be new or blow your mind, but overall it's just full of information that everyone should know and be able to refer to as just facts."

9,0060005696,http://goodreads.com/user/show/130454-donna,4,"In The Paradox of Choice, Schwartz focuses on two basic ways of making decisions: maximizing (trying to make the very best possible choice) and satisficing (making a choice that will do well enough, all things considered).In the past, I've thought of these two approaches in terms of the decisions that need to be made, not in terms of the person making them. For example, when picking a spouse or a house, one may want to take a lot of time and make the best possible decision. When selecting a restaurant or an article of clothing, satisficing is usually the best approach. Schwartz divides the world into ""maximizers"" and ""satisficers,"" a notion that I found very interesting. One of his themes is that ""maximizers"" can drive themselves crazy by trying to make the ""best"" possible decision in every situation; it follows that ""satisficers"" tend to be healthier. As a congenital satisficer and friend to a couple of ""maximizers,"" I found the argument compelling. I think the book has some good insights into the stresses of modern living, and I highly recommend it for people who like to think about how they think. "

11,0060005696,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9862564-erika-rs,3,"Schwartz describes how having an excessive amount of choice in our lives can bring unhappiness and suffering. He describes some of the many sources of choices in modern life, some psychological factors relating to choice making, how choices can cause unhappiness, and some techniques for dealing with this unhappiness.First of all, Schwartz emphasizes that choice is good. It is vital to happiness. However, he claims that in the here and now of the 21st century US, we are overwhelmed with choices, most of which are not important and many of which were not faced in the past. Schwartz's claim is that while choice is important, having to use brain power on unimportant choices slowly chips away at happiness. The important choices differ for each individual, so society should not necessarily work to decrease the choices available. However, individuals need to learn how to focus on choices that are important for them and ignore the rest.Schwartz then discusses decision making. Decision making includes figuring out goals, evaluating the importance of each goal, arraying the options, evaluating each option relative to the goals, pick the winning option, and later using the consequences of the choice to modify future decision making processes. In practice, this process if followed partially and with limited consciousness.Schwartz proposes that there are two types of choosers: maximizers and satisficers. Maximizers want to make the best decisions. Satisficers have a set of goals and are satisfied with any choice that fulfills those goals. Schwartz claims that maximizers might get objectively better results than satisficers, but satisficers get better subjective results (that is, they are happier). Everyone is a maximizer in some areas and a satisficer in others, but most people have a general tendency one way or the other.The core of the book explores how choice decreases happiness. There are two key points. First, comparing a choice made with a choice that could have been made generally decreases happiness; it is likely that there is some way in which the another choice was superior to the chosen option, even if it was the best choice overall. Second, people adapt; over time, the happiness derived from a choice decreases, contrary to expectations that the happiness would remain constant. These two factors make people more likely to regret the choices they and more likely to feel they do not have control over their happiness. Furthermore, these factors will be more potent for maximizers because they cannot fall back on the idea that their goals were met.After making a convincing case that excessive choice can decrease happiness, Schwartz discusses a set of tips for preventing too much choice from decreasing your happiness:- Choose when to choose. Not all decisions on important. Decide which ones are important to you, and do not worry about the rest.- Be a chooser, not a picker. Make your decisions based on your goals, not just by picking something out of all the choices available. This means that if nothing fits your goals, you may choose not to take any of the options.- Satisfice more and maximize less.- Think about the opportunity costs of opportunity costs. That is, limit how much you think about the opportunities you are missing out on.- Make your decisions non-reversible. This one seems counter intuitive, but the idea is that if you cannot unmake a choice, you are more likely to try to be satisfied with it and making it work.- Practice an ""attitude of gratitude"". If you focus on why the choices you have already made were the right choice to make, you will have an easier time not comparing it negatively to the choices you could have made.- Regret less. Be a satisficer, not a maximizer. Reduce the number of options you have; you cannot miss what you do not know about.- Anticipate adaption. Know that the pleasure a choice brings you in the future will probably not be as much as the initial pleasure it gives you so that you will not be disappointed when that happens.- Control expectations. Set your expectations based on your goals and your needs. Be especially wary of letting others (especially the media or advertising) set your expectations.- Curtail social comparison. Compare yourself to others less. Try to let your satisfaction be determined by how you feel about a decision, not how the actions or choices of others make you think you should feel.- Learn how to love constraints. Constraints can decrease the amount of time you spend on the unimportant choices and give you the time to focus on the important ones.Schwartz justifies his claims reasonably well with citations of psychological studies, and he is generally good at pointing out which claims are his own hypotheses and inferences and which are not. Overall, his arguments are convincing, and his claims generally consistent with my own experience, so I am willing to believe with his overall premise that too much choice can decrease happiness.My main criticism of The Paradox of Choice is that it often seemed like Schwartz was bulking up his points with repetition to make the book longer. The primary content of the book could have fit into a long essay. Since there is not really a market for long essays these days, I do not blame Schwartz for bulking things up to make it book length.After reading this book, I am going to consciously try to be aware of when I am making choices, when those choices are decreasing my happiness, and what choices are important to me. That awareness alone is reason enough to have read the book for me."

13,0060005696,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11869072-jeanette,2,"This book had some good points. Enough to make a decent length research article maybe, but not the length or breadth for a book of these subsequent verbose assumptions. Yes, things ARE too complex. And really they don't need to be so complex, but humans and their organizations, in particular- have made them so. As I am not a maximizer in any sense, and least of all in the material- this was rather a waste of time for me to read, IMHO.If you are competitive in nature to the extreme, have difficulty making up your mind, obsessively shop or acquire- or find yourself at 35 or 40 years of age idealistic to the point of being either a perfectionist or a ""true believer"" for some bigger agenda or barely into ""living"" your own life or career- then this may be a good book for you to read.Most of the psychology here was not, but rather pseudo in definition and example, IMHO. A study of satisfaction is not the same as equating the opposite emotion as being depression, for instance. When humans are not feeling successful in their own autonomous actions, then they are much more often tending to perceive their own self-identity or worth as being poor or being diminished. And to shut out or reject by mood others that differ with their own opinion about themselves.  "

The book makes a strong case (backed by research) on the side-effects of living with a plethora of choices. More choices and options always looked like something to aspire to but the repercussions of the continued proliferation of choices in all fields at these ridiculous rates is very alarming when its effect is taken cumulatively.
15,0060005696,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18944510-mario-tomic,5,"The big idea of this book is that after a certain threshold having too many choices will decrease our happiness regardless if we make the best choice in the end. I like the part of the book where the author goes in detail to explain choice paralysis which is something I dealt with a lot myself. Paralysis happens when when there's too many options. Naturally we tend to make worse decisions because we attempt to simplify the choices to a point where the simplification reduces our ability to make a good choice. Moreover the book talks about 2 different ways to make decisions, the author divided people into ""Maximizers"" and ""Satisficers"".Maximizers are people who tend to search all the options, gather all possible information in order to make the best possible choice. This consumes a lot of time, and often leads to doubts and stress, especially when no one clear winner. Satisficers are those who settle for a choice that is ""good enough"" to fit their needs. What the author argues is that satisficers are generally happier with their choice, and spend less time choosing, leaving them free to enjoy other things. Since we live in the age where we have to make hundreds of choices on a daily basis and thousands of choices in our life having too much of autonomy is making us unhappy. The practical takeaway from this book is that we should mostly aim to be satisficers, rather than maximizers. On top of at we should proactively try to eliminate as many low value low impact choices as we can in order to focus on what really matters in life. Very interested book, highly recommended!"

It shows that there's concrete data backing up many of the ""well duh"" platitudes people regularly dismiss while making terrible life choices.The book was a revelation for me, since it related a lot to the culture of worry and second guessing I grew up with. Part exploration of our society of excessive options and the misery they seem to cause our inhabitants, and part self-help guide, it's the opposite of ""True Enough"", it's a book that rather succinctly sums up the solutions Mr. Schwartz feels we have available in regards to our indecision towards our lives.It's a deeply thought provoking book, so instead of trying to summarize his points, almost all of which I agree with, I suggest you do a search on Barry Schwartz in Google Videos or Youtube, as several lectures by him are available. Explaining the real science behind why chasing the dollar and comparing your success to others produces misery has genuinely changed my outlook on how to handle choice in a culture of overwhelming possibilities."
17,0060005696,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,4,"It sounds so non-intuitive; why are less happy when we are given many choices, than when we have few or even none? I was rather skeptical at first. However, this book explains, in a very readable way, why this is so. It has to do with the difference between objective and subjective results. Objectively, when given a choice, we end up with a superior result. When given a choice, we end up with a better match to our desires; a better vacation, a better partner, a better car, a better stereo, a better cereal, a better college. But we judge our happiness in an subjective manner. We consider all the possibilities that we did not choose as ""opportunities that were lost"". We feel regret, and we compare our outcomes with those of other people. As a result, we feel less happy.One of the things that really helps the author's arguments, are the research results that he, personally conducted as a psychology professor."
18,0060005696,http://goodreads.com/user/show/116622-hilary,5,"This book explained so much about the way I behave -- I am a total maximizer, meaning that whenever I have a choice to make, I always want the absolute best option, even if researching to discover the best option is hard and time-consuming. Instead, I could be a satisficer: someone who picks the option that satisfies all their requirements, without worrying whether something better is out there. Schwartz shows persuasively that maximizers are less happy than satisficers. This book helped me understand myself better and may help me be a happier person in the future by concentrating less on the things that are unimportant."

But is the parent really myopic? Living in the constrained, protective world of the fishbowl enables this young fish to experiment, to explore, to create,to write its life story without worrying about starving or being eaten. Without the fishbowl, there truly would be no limits. But the fish would have to spend all its time just struggling to stay alive. Choice within constraints, freedom within limits, is what enables the little fish to imagine a host of marvelous possibilities. ""Ps: i made the wrong choice of listening to the audiobook instead of reading it, and couldn't focus at times, but then again i found a way to read it and i enjoy it, and that in a satisficer's way was enough 😁."
20,0060005696,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5422600-kristi-thielen,2,"Barry Schwartz is chiefly concerned with explaining that an abundance of opportunities - especially for material goods - can actually decrease happiness and that ""maximizers,"" - people in relentless pursuit of the best of all things and agonized by the fear that their decision might be the wrong one - would be better off as ""satisficers,"" - people who discipline themselves to consider only a limited range of options and then make a firm decision and get on with life. Learn to accept ""good enough,"" because with many things in life, this really is going to be ""best"" for you. Learn to grow where you are planted; learn to let go of regret, accept that the great excitement about something today will fade with time, because we adapt to novelty. Stop paying attention to what others around you are doing (or how WELL they are doing) and remember that ""he who dies with the most toys, wins,"" is a bumper sticker, not an exercise in wisdom. All this is fine and good but the book suffers from two problems, only the first of which can be blamed on the author: 1. This is a good magazine-length article, which seems to have been padded to create a book.2. I found this in the ""science"" section of Borders Bookstore and therefore expected a more scholarly tone. It should more appropriately be shelved in ""Self-Help,"" as the author assumes the reader is a ""maximizer"" in need of converting. If you have an overly materialistic and obsessive friend, do a good deed and give this book to them. If you really aren't a maximizer . . . don't worry about reading this. Get on with life. "

The subject matter is very interesting - why we (the developed world in particular) are getting more depressed despite our standard of living ostensibly rising with each passing day? A lot of the explanations are common sense if you think about it, such as too much choice is a bad thing, social comparisons make us sad, and losing something after having it is worse than not having it at all. I enjoyed the conclusions of the book, but find myself wishing that it would have been 2/3rds of its actual length. I would recommend this book as intermittent reading or for skimming through."

23,0060005696,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12287031-kiwi-begs2differ,4,"Very interesting book on the psychological reasons for the choices people make and the consequences of increased options to their overall satisfaction. The author thesis is that, while some choice is good, more choice is not necessarily better. As a culture, we like freedom, self-determination, and variety, and we are reluctant to give up any of our options, but clinging tenaciously to all the choices available to us contributes to bad decisions, anxiety and stress.A few personal takeaway points:-	Choice overload causes pre and/or post regret. I kept nodding my head when reading about “inaction inertia”(see quote below), which is likely the cause for my returning from shopping empty handed (and consequent frustration of my satisfier husband at my maximizer attitude :)-	Our evaluation of an experience is as much a reflection of what we bring into it (i.e. expectation) as much of the experience itself. A student receives a B+ mark, is this good or bad? If they expected an A then is bad news but if they expected B, they will be pleased. Reinforcing the Buddhist theory that the way to find happiness is to lower your expectations.-	Unattainable expectations plus a tendency to take personal responsibility for failure make a bad combination. Maximisers put a lot of work into decision making and have higher expectations about the results of those decisions and so will be bitterly disappointed when something goes wrong, they are prime candidate for depression.-	Social comparison provides information that help people evaluate experiences and set their own ‘hedonic thermometer’. E.g. when reading a book with raving reviews I feel disappointment if it does not live up to the “hype” (subjectively speaking of course), and end up giving it a lower rating and vice versa, higher rating for books that I didn’t expect to enjoy that much. There is a lot of common sense in this book and the proffered advice is not exactly ground-breaking, but the author provides a number of examples to his theory that too much choice is not an advantage. These case studies are in fields such as health insurance, retirement plans, medical care, identity etc. that I didn’t think about before and made me reflect. 3.5 starsFav. Quotes:It seems to be a fairly general principle that when making choices among alternatives that involve a certain amount of risk or uncertainty, we prefer a small, sure gain to a larger, uncertain one. Most of us, for example, will choose a sure $100 over a coin flip (a fifty-fifty chance) that determines whether we win $200 or nothing. When the possibilities involve losses, however, we will risk a large loss to avoid a smaller one. For example, we will choose a coin flip that determines whether we lose $200 or nothing over a sure loss of $100.Bronze medalists are happier than silver medalists. As the silver medalists stand on the award platform, they’re thinking about how close they came to winning the gold. Just a little more of this, and a little less of that, and ultimate glory would have been theirs. As the bronze medalists stand on that platform, however, they’re thinking about how close they came to getting no medal at all. The near miss of the silver medalists is triumph, whereas the near miss of the bronze medalists is also-ran obscurity.Another effect that the desire to avoid regret can have is to induce people not to act at all, what is called inaction inertia. Imagine being in the market for a sofa and seeing one you like on sale for 30 percent below list price. It’s fairly early in your search, and you think that you may be able to do better, so you pass up the sale. Several weeks of shopping fail to turn up anything better, so you go back to buy the one you saw earlier. The trouble is that now it’s selling for 10 percent off list price. Do you buy it? For many shoppers, the answer is no. If they buy it, there will be no way to avoid regretting not having bought it earlier. If they don’t buy it, they still keep the possibility alive that they’ll find something better.The more options there are, the more if only’s you will be able to generate. And with each if only you generate will come a little more regret and a little less satisfaction with the choice you actually made. Though it may be annoying to go into a bank and discover that only a single teller’s window is open and the line is long, there won’t be anything to regret. But what if there are two long lines and you choose the wrong one?"
24,0060005696,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26517939-bouke,5,"This book hit me at the right time. It describes how the happiness goes in a U-curve following the number of options you have, at first more options is great as it leads to competition and better outcomes, but at a certain point the number of options can be so overwhelming that trying to find the best one causes you more stress than is worth it. TL;DR is: go for the suboptimal choice, one that you can be satisfied with and stick with it. Don’t try to go for ‘the best’ because there is no such thing, not for everyone. "
25,0060005696,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1500718-ryan,4,"The Paradox of Choice is easy to read, perhaps because its ideas have found their way into the culture. Regardless, it explains a lot. The core arguments: -We would be better off if we embraced certain voluntary constraints. -We would be better off seeking what is ""good enough"" instead of what is best. -We would be better off if we lowered our expectations of the results of decisions. -We would be better off if the decisions we made were nonreversible. -We would be better off if we paid less attention to what others around us were doing.The arguments may be counter intuitive, but the book is convincing.Although The Paradox of Choice applies to many aspects of life, I perhaps unusually encountered it as a teacher. Specifically, I've become increasingly sensitive to my students' distress when they're given free rein to create assignments and their own objectives (which some people feel is the only true type of education). Many students almost immediately suffer mild panic attacks. How can that be? We often say that curiosity should be intrinsically motivating and uniquely rewarding -- there's a whole world to discover, after all. It seems to me, however, that we often underestimate that learning can include doubt, stress, and anxiety. One of my students this term wrote a research essay and said at the end that the entire process was awful: ""I never knew if I was researching something useful."" A student from a different class after the same unit said ""it's just easier to have a curriculum of important, relevant information."" Following a set curriculum probably is a lot easier, even if it implies a false limit on any study. I often hear that the disciplines and the preset curricula are too rigid because there isn't enough room to just explore. That may be true, but this book can be read as a caution on that impulse.Regardless, it's a quick and informative read. Do read it."

I do not agree with all of his points, but his main message I think its pretty good and useful to keep in mind.

Often too many choices can actually create more problems or even immobilize us in our decision making. The author offers many meaningful examples from shopping for small and large items, to college courses and majors, to relationships. These principles apply in many settings.Several parts of this book reminded me of my decision analysis class in graduate school and our textbook - Smart Choices A Practical Guide to Making Better Decisions. Maybe I need to go back to making more dancing line graphs. :)I tend to be a maximizer in some areas of my life, so this was a particularly helpful read for me. (No wonder I've been looking to buy a house for over a year and a half.) :) I see how important it is to step back and think about what choices really matter and spend our time on those decisions and not worry as much about the rest. At the end of the book the author summarizes with these eleven suggestions for dealing with too many choices. I thought they were quite insightful:1. Choose when to choose.2. Be a chooser, not a picker.3. Satisfice more and maximize less.4. Think about the opportunity costs of opportunity costs.5. Make your decisions nonreversible.6. Practice an 'attitude of gratitude.'7. Regret less.8. Anticipate adaptation.9. Control expectations.10. Curtail social comparisons.11. Learn to love constraintsHere are a few other quotes I liked from the book:""This book is about the choices Americans face in almost all areas of life...there is no denying that choice improves the quality of our lives. It enables us to control our destinies and to come close to getting exactly what we want out of any situation. Choice is essential to autonomy, which is absolutely fundamental to well-being. Healthy people want and need to direct their own lives. On the other hand, the fact that some choice is good doesn't necessarily mean that more choice is better (p. 3).""""I believe that we make the most of our freedom by learning to make good choices about the things that matter, while at the same time unburdening ourselves from too much concern about the things that don't (p. 4).""""Filtering out extraneous information is one of the basic functions of consciousness. If everything available to our senses demanded our attention at all times, we wouldn't be able to get through the day (p. 23).""""When should you start looking for a new job? The answer seems to be that you start looking the day you begin your current job. Think for a moment about what this means to each of us as decision makers. It means that the questions 'Where should I work?' and 'What kind of work should I do?' are never resolved. Nothing is ever settled. The antennae for new and better opportunities are always active (p. 36).""""Choosing well is difficult, and most decisions have several different dimensions. When leasing an apartment, you consider location, spaciousness, condition, safety, and rent....Most good decisions will involve these steps:1. Figure out your goal or goals.2. Evaluate the importance of each goal.3. Array the options.4. Evaluate how likely each of the options is to meet your goals.5. Pick the winning option.6. Later use the consequences of your choice to modify your goals, the importance you assign them, and the way you evaluate future possibilities (p. 48).""""We evaluate positive experiences on the basis of how good they feel at their best, and how good they feel at the end. Thus, you might, in retrospect, remember a one-week vacation that had some great moments and finished with a bang as more pleasant than a three-week vacation that also had some great moments, but finished only with a whimper (p. 51)."" ""The growth of options and opportunities for choice has three, related, unfortunate effects. It means that decisions require more effort. It makes mistakes more likely. It makes the psychological consequences of mistakes more severe. Finally, the very wealth of options before us may turn us from choosers into pickers. A chooser is someone who thinks actively about the possibilities before making a decision. A chooser reflects on what's important to him or her in life, what's important about this particular decision, and what is the short- and long-range consequences of the decisions may be....A chooser is thoughtful enough to conclude that perhaps none of the available alternatives are satisfactory, and that if he or she wants the right alternative, he or she may have to create it. A picker does none of these things. With a world of choices rushing by like a music video, all a picker can do is grab this or that and hope for the best (p. 75).""""Choosing wisely beings with developing a clear understanding of your goals. And the first choice you must make is between the goal of choosing the absolute best and the goal of choosing something that is good enough. If you seek and accept only the best, you are a maximizer (p. 77).""""Being a maximizer is correlated with being unhappy (p. 86).""""For a satisficer...the more options there are, the more likely it is that the satisficer will find one that meets his or her standards. Adding options doesn't necessarily add much work for the satisficer, because the satisficer feels no compulsion to check out all the possibilities before deciding (p. 93).""""As important as the instrumental value of choice may be, choice reflects another value that might be even more important. Freedom to choose has what might be called expressive value. Choice is what enables us to tell the world who we are and what we care about (p. 100).""""We must learn to be selective in exercising our choices. We must decide, individually, when choice really matters and focus our energies there, even if it means letting many other opportunities pass us by. The choice of when to be a chooser may be the most important choice we have to make (p. 104).""""What seems to be the most important factor in providing happiness is close social relations. People who are married, who have good friends, and who are close to their families are happier than those who are not. People who participate in religious communities are happier than those who do not. Being connected to others seems to be much more important to subjective well-being than being rich (p. 107).""""Being forced to confront trade-offs in making decisions makes people unhappy and indecisive (p. 125).""""As the stakes of decisions involving trade-offs rise, emotions become more powerful and our decision making can be severely impaired (p. 132).""""Distinguishing between good and bad is a far simpler matter than distinguishing good from better from best (p. 142).""""Keeping options open seems to extract a psychological price. When we can change our minds, apparently we do less psychological work to justify the decision we've made....As a result, individuals with 'nonreversible' marriages might be more satisfied than individuals with 'reversible' ones (p. 145).""""Both types of regret--anticipated and postdecision--will raise the emotional stakes of decisions. Anticipated regret will make decisions harder to make, and postdecision regret will make them harder to enjoy (p. 148).""""We should try to do more downward counterfactual thinking. While upward conterfactual thinking may inspire us to do better the next time, downward counterfactual thinking may induce us to be grateful for how well we did this time (p. 154).""""Concern for status is nothing new. Nonetheless, I believe that the problem is more acute now than in the past, and once again it comes back to having a plethora of choices....When we engage in social comparisons, to whom do we compare ourselves? In earlier times, such comparisons were necessarily local. We looked around at our neighbors and family members. We didn't have access to information about people outside our immediate social circle. But with the explosion of telecommunications--TV, movies, the Internet--almost everyone has access to information about almost everyone else (p. 190).""""The nursing home residents given a small measure of control over their daily lives were more active and alert, and reported a greater sense of well-being than the residents without such control. Even more dramatically, the residents who had control lived several years longer, on average, than the residents who did not. Thus, from cradle to grave, having control over one's life matters (p. 206).""""Focus on what makes you happy, and what gives meaning to your life (p. 235).""I am grateful for the opportunity to make choices and decisions in life. I am even grateful for options, but I think that some of these principles might help me move forward in some areas where I might be holding out for the perfect solution. :)"

When reading this book, I had to take a second and think about situations where I had been quite clearly overthinking my options for things that now seem so irrelevant. Has this book made me go with my gut with decisions? No. And I’m very glad about that. But it has made me much more aware to what decisions deserve a second thought and where my time should be focused. It’s made me more comfortable settling for good enough. What interested me the most was the impact that capitalism and consumerism has had on our choices and I don’t just mean in terms of clothing and technology and all that, but on a wider scale.Although I really enjoyed the majority of what was discussed throughout I have got to admit I had to laugh at “I know that employment prospects and possibilities are not equally available to everyone ... but not as many as in the past” and I almost stopped reading right there. I think social class could have been explored a lot more and I often found throughout there were many offhand comments about how some may not be able to afford new things and keep up to date, but there was absolutely no depth to these comments. Class plays a big role in choices and opportunities available to someone and though I can understand that this may be less of a problem for the working class, nowadays, that statement angered me because some really don’t have a lot of choice in certain departments even when it comes to food shopping.Overall, I liked it but other factors in choice making or there lack of should have been better addressed even just with an extra sentence."

It is true that this book was stretched when it could have been more concise and nobody can disagree with that. However, I did enjoy the way it was written. There was a lot of attention given to this topic from many angles and for some people perhaps the ideas in this book are totally new and worth exploring that way. More is less or less is more remains just an interpretable statement left in the air, until someone chooses to grab it and elaborate. I personally think choice is great and there's no such thing as having too much of it, as long as one trains themselves to triage it and has the 'guts' to face it all and develops the skill to recognize when to stop or where to stop. I disagree with the idea that the more choices we have the more liley we are to make a mistake, as this depends entirely on circumstance and on what are the actual choices as well as how informed the choice maker is about said choices. I can agree however that there's a ton of crap out there, but also a lot of it won't resonate with you and won't be something that you're interested in which will narrow it down a lot. There is always room for 'better' and there will always be 'other choices', so the reasonable thing to do is to make a reasonably 'good enough' and 'timely' decision and just stick through with it. The odds of it being very wrong are just about as random as it being very good, you can't control some things about outcomes and the future.I feel like this book kinda gives more anxiety by the time you're done reading it in a way, because it brings so much awareness about choice that perhaps you didn't previously consider. But if you find solace in knowledge and understanding like I do, you'll get a better clarity of mind concerning choice and making a good enough choice. I was also familiar with some research and experiments outlined in the book which were nice to revisit nonetheless. I particularly enjoyed the 'unhapiness pandemic' topic being addressed through the lens of the title paradox. Not a bad read at all! When given a perspective like this, it just makes me wish life was simpler like before; but it's very important to be grateful for the society we live in right now, which spoils us beyond measure and just proves to use our insatiable nature."

33,0060005696,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1100427-katherine-cowley,5,"This book convincingly makes the case that having more choices can actually limit our freedom. The more choices we have about trivial things, the more time we have to spend on them, and we become, in essence, ""foragers"", sifting through a world of choice. More choices can also make important decisions harder, raising our expectations, encouraging us to seek for the ""best"" which must be out there somewhere, and increasing our sense of regret by comparison of the choices to others. This psychology book is presented in a compelling way, using everyday examples and fun comics from different magazines and newspapers. And I'm sold. On his scale of maximizers (those who spend lots of time, energy, and emotion trying to compare absolutely everything as make the best choice) and satisficers (those who set a certain standard of goodness, and once they find it, accept it, even if there might be something better out there) I fall somewhere in the middle. I agree--I would probably be happier if I was more of a satisficer.In part I'm sold on the concepts of this book because it matches up with some of my personal beliefs. For example, a lot of times we gain pleasure because of novelty, and the risk is that we will always have to find more novelty to have pleasure. Schwartz recommends gratitude as an antidote. From personal experience, finding joy in simple things brings me a lot of happiness.Schwartz also talks about making decisions that actually limit the full range of choices. For example, getting married and having kids, becoming involved in a community, forming close friendships, and participating in a religion all limit your choices. You now have obligations, responsibilities, and certain restrictions. Yet studies have shown time and time again that it is relationships that bring us the most happiness, although they require us to limit certain choices. Schwartz's research helps explain to me why I find following the commandments of my religion liberating, rather than restricting--they set certain standards and choices for me so I don't have to make them, and can focus on other choices that matter more to me, as well as having the time, health, and spiritual fuel that help me live a happy life. I'd definitely recommend this book, and while it is about human psychology, it's not a slow or scary read."

As I will demonstrate, there is a cost to having an overload of choice. As a culture, we are enamored of freedom, self-determination, and variety, and we are reluctant to give up any of our options. But clinging tenaciously to all the choices available to us contributes to bad decisions, to anxiety, stress, and dissatisfaction— even to clinical depression.” ~ Barry Schwartz from The Paradox of ChoiceBarry Schwartz is a Professor of Social Theory and Social Action at Swarthmore College and this book is packed with Big Ideas on how, as the sub-title suggests, “the culture of abundance robs us of satisfaction.” In short, we now have so many options that we’re suffering. “I believe we make the most of our freedoms by learning to make good choices about the things that matter, while at the same time unburdening ourselves from too much concern about the things that don’t.”“We can imagine a point at which the options would be so copious that even the world’s most ardent supporters of freedom of choice would begin to say, “enough already.” Unfortunately, that point of revulsion seems to recede endlessly into the future.”Here are some of the Big Ideas:1. Gratitude = happy with choices2. Being Seduced - By branding. We all are.3. Maximizers vs. Satisficers - Huge idea.4. Perfectionism - Tends to go with maximizing.5. Domain Specificity - Maximizing is domain specific.Here's my video review:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sq9ng...And click here to find 250+ more of my reviews:http://bit.ly/BrianReviewsBrian"
35,0060005696,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46134979-juliet,4,"My initial rating of this book was 3 stars, as I felt the book was repetitive and the ""tips"" in Part 3 seem like an afterthought and lack thorough exploration. However, upon more reflection, I realized how much the ideas in this book were sticking and that it changed my perspective on shopping, making choices, advertising, and my general outlook on day to day tasks. This is where the book gained another star from me. While the book is repetitive and the author really does belabor his points at times, it is effective in making the material memorable. The book is more akin to a textbook than a light, fun read - but just when it becomes too much the author moves on to the next point. The edition I read is from 2005 so there were some outdated references, but it amazed me how many of the issues are still happening and have grown since this was published. I especially enjoyed the psychological breakdown of why people make decisions the way they do and why some people feel regret while others don’t. As a “maximizer”, this was eye-opening and explained so much about how I feel before and after making decisions. I appreciate that the author spent a little time at the end with some tips for how to be happier with your choices and not fall down the rabbit hole of regret and comparison. If you are a ""maximizer"" and feel the need to always research and find the best choice (even for small choices like what to eat for dinner), I highly recommend this book for helpful insight. I hope to become more of a ""satisficer"" and be happy with ""good enough"" more often!"
36,0060005696,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8438607-mitch,5,"An important book and one that spoke to my personal development. There are so many choices in today's world that can be overwhelming. At times, I find myself stressed out by choices... this book showed me that I am most definitely not alone. It also gave me tools I can use to make choices in a healthier way. For example, Schwartz loosely places people into two categories: Maximizers & Satisficers. Maximizers want to make the ""best"" choice in every possible situation: Career, relationships, material purchases, even choosing a movie or a restaurant, etc. These choices can feel stressful, even if that stress is just in our head. Satisficers are happy with something that's ""good enough"". They also tend to compare themselves with others less often, regret decisions less, look forward rather than backward. There's a place for both in the world, but Schwartz argues that being more of a satisficer is a very healthy thing in today's world. I know I'll be focused more on ""satisficing"" rather than ""maximizing"" every decision I make. A very well written book. You wouldn't think it by reading the description, but I'd say this book is more of a true ""self help"" book than all those self help books out there! "
37,0060005696,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5960707-john-jp,3,"This book is an argument for the idea that the proliferations of choices we choose from is making us sick and in fact is reducing the quality of and happiness surrounding the choices we make. This is basically a research paper turned into a commercial product. I found the book entertaining but incredibly long winded and repetitive. The essential message of the book can be gotten by reading the Prologue: The Paradox of Choice: A road map, Part I: When we choose and Part IV What we can do. What lies between are the details of and the supporting evidence for his premise. The book is dated in its references to technology. It was written in 2004. The book’s message none the less is still relevant for today’s readers. The phenoma it is addressing has only gotten worse. This book is similar to The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do in Life and Business by Charles Duhigg and Simple Rules: How to Thrive in a Complex World by Donald Sull, Kathleen M. Eisenhardt both these books are better than The Paradox of Choice., in that their basic message, application of their message and writing styles are more concise. That is not to say the book is not worth reading. The supporting data in this book is excellent. It is has a great index and fantastic references."
38,0060005696,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67110-travis-murdock,4,"The Paradox of Choice includes dozens of insights and studies that theorize that Americans are less happy in part because of their over abundance of choice. The first 50 pages set up this theory in exhausting detail. I was ready to give up. After passing through the lengthy intro, I found the studies to support something I have been thinking about for several years. When I'm faced with many choices - I frequently choose not to choose anything. I also seem much less satisfied with my choice after it is made. The book introduces the solution - good enough - allowing you to set high standards without always fighting to maximize your decision. A great book that is an easy read. If you find yourself drifting in the beginning - skip to page 50 for the meat. Instead of thinking you are cheating, think that you are taking the book's advice to reduce your choices."
39,0060005696,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4633020-sara,5,"When people have no choices, life is hard. Choice brings dignity, autonomy, control, and a measure of happiness. However, in our present culture, our number of choices has multiplied to the point where the freedom to choose is actually oppressive. We spend too much time and energy on making decisions and are frequently disappointed by the results. We're constantly comparing ourselves and our stuff to others, and conditioned by the media to never be satisfied with who we are or what have. The best part of this book is the section that gives practical remedies to ""over choice"". His ideas can actually re-train people to stop wasting so much time on decisions that don't matter, and to be happy with the decisions we've already made. Rules and limitations can be good! "

41,0060005696,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10526064-carol,5,This book was a life changer for me when I read it a few years ago.
42,0060005696,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1384140-tess,5,"I loved this book, and have already found it extremely useful in my mindset and general well-being. Seriously, life-changing. At times it was incredibly convicting, as I fit decisively (ha!) into the ""maximizer"" stereotype, freaking out over every little choice and drowning in daily minutiae. And other times, he drew out some very good points that I already ascribe to, and felt myself going ""You tell 'em!"" Anyway, I think the problem of having too many choices is something that's very glossed over today, and most people aren't aware of it. I would recommend this book to every single person I know.The highlights according to me are below.-----------------------------As a culture, we are enamored of freedom, self-determination, and variety, and we are reluctant to give up any of our options. But clinging tenaciously to all the choices available to us contributes to bad decisions, to anxiety, stress, and dissatisfaction -- even to clinical depression.Comparison shopping to get the best price adds still another dimension to the array of choices, so that if you were a truly careful shopper, you could spend the ether part of a day just to select a box of crackers, as you worried about price, flavor, freshness, fat, sodium, and calories.In the modern university, each individual student is free to pursue almost any interest, without having to be harnessed to what his intellectual ancestors thought was worth knowing. But this freedom may come at a price. Now students are required to make choices about education that may affect them for the rest of their lives. And they are forced to make these choices at a point in their intellectual development when they may lack the resources to make them intelligently.Filtering out extraneous information is one of the basic functions of consciousness. If everything available to our senses demanded our attention at all times, we wouldn't be able to get through the day.Much of human progress has involved reducing the time and energy, as well as the number of processes we have to engage in and think about, for each of us to obtain the necessities of life. … As cultures advanced, not every individual had to focus every bit of energy, every day, on filling his belly. Eons later, manufacturers and merchants made life simpler still. Individuals could simply purchase food and clothing and household items, often, until very recently, at the same general store. The variety of offerings was meager, but the time spent procuring them was minimal as well. In the past few decades, though, that long process of simplifying and bundling economic offerings has been reversed. Increasingly, the trend moves back toward time-consuming foraging behavior, as each of us is forced to sift for ourselves through more and more options in almost every aspect of life.The burden of having every activity be a matter of deliberate and conscious choice would be too much for any of us to bear. The transformation of choice in modern life is that choice in many facets of life has gone from implicit and often psychologically unreal to explicit and psychologically very real. So we now face a demand to make choices that is unparalleled in human history.How we assess risk offers another example of how our judgments can be distorted by availability. In one study, researchers asked respondents to estimate the number of deaths per year that occur as a result of various diseases, car accidents, natural disasters, electrocutions, and homicides -- forty different types of misfortune in all. The researchers then compared people's answers to actual death rates, with striking results. In general, dramatic, vivid causes of death (accident, homicide, tornado, flood, fire) were overestimated, whereas more mundane causes of death (diabetes, asthma, stroke, tuberculosis) were underestimated. … People mistook the pervasiveness of newspaper stories about homicides, accidents or fires -- vivid, salient, and easily available to memory -- as a sign of the frequency of the vents these stories profiled. This distortion causes us to miscalculate dramatically the various risks we face in life, and thus contributes to some very bad choices.As telecommunications becomes ever more global, each of us, no matter where we are, may end up relying on the same secondhand information. National news sources such as CNN or USA Today tell everyone in the country, and now even the world, the same story, which makes it less likely that an individual's biased understanding of the evidence will be corrected by his friends and neighbors. Those friends and neighbors will have the same biased understanding, derived from the same source. When you hear the same story everywhere you look and listen, you assume it must be true. And the more people believe it's true, the more likely they are to repeat it, and thus the more likely you are to hear it. This is how inaccurate information can create a bandwagon effect, leading quickly to a broad, but mistaken, consensus.How do you determine how much to spend on a suit? One way is to compare the price of one suit to another, which means using the other items as anchors, or standards. In a store that displays suits costing over $1,500, and $800 pinstripe may seem like a good buy. But in a store in which most of the suits cost less than $500, that same $800 suit might seem like an extravagance. … Anchoring is why department stores seem to have some of their merchandise on sale most of the time, to give the impression that customers are getting a bargain.The alternative to maximizing is to be a satisficer. To satisfice is to settle for something that is good enough and not worry about the possibility that there might be something better. A satisficer has criteria and standards. She searches until she finds an item that meets those standards, and at that point, she stops.What seems to be the most important factor in providing happiness is close social relations. People who are married, who have good friends, and who are close to their families are happier than those who are not. People who participate in religious communities are happier than those who do not. Being connected to others seems to be much more important to subjective well-being than being rich. But a word of caution is in order. We know with certainty that there is a relation between being able to connect socially and being happy. It is less clear, however, which is the cause and which is the effect. Miserable people are surely less likely than happy people to have close friends, devoted family, and enduring marriages. So it is at least possible that happiness comes first and close relations come second. What seems likely to me is that the causality works both ways: happy people attract others to them, and being with others makes people happy.In the context of this discussion of choice and autonomy, it is also important to note that, in many ways, social ties actually decrease freedom, choice, and autonomy. Marriage, for example, is a commitment to a particular other person that curtails freedom of choice of sexual and even emotional partners. And serious friendship imposes a lasting hold on you. To be someone's friend is to undertake weighty responsibilities and obligations that at times may limit your own freedom. The same is true, obviously, of family. And to a large extent, the same is true of involvement with religious institutions. Most religious institutions call on their members to live their lives in a certain way and to take responsibility for the well-being of their fellow congregants. So, counterintuitive as it may appear, what seems to contribute most to happiness binds us rather than liberates us. How can this notion be reconciled with the popular belief that freedom of choice leads to fulfillment? …. As Lane put it very simply … ""There are too many life choices…without concern for the resulting overload…and the lack of constraint by custom…that is, demands to discover or create an identity rather than to accept a given identity."" …. In other words, our social fabric is no longer a birthright but has become a series of deliberate and demanding choices.Most people find it extremely challenging to balance the conflicting impulses of freedom of choice on the one hand and loyalty and commitment on the other. Each person is expected to figure out this balance individually. Those who value freedom of choice and movement will tend to stay away from entangling relationships; those who value stability and loyalty will seek them. Many will cobble together some mixture of these two modes of social engagement. …. But if unrestricted freedom can impede the individual's pursuit of what he or she values most, then it may be that some restrictions make everyone better off.As our material and social circumstances improve, our standards of comparison go up. As we have contact with items of high quality, we begin to suffer from ""the curse of discernment."" The lower quality items that use to be perfectly acceptable are no longer good enough. The hedonic zero point keeps rising, and expectations and aspirations rise with it. …. If your hedonic assessment derives from the relation between the objective quality of an experience and your expectations, then the rising quality of experience is met with rising expectations, and you're just running in place. …. As long as expectations keep pace with realizations, people may live better, but they won't feel better about how they live.We all seem to be swimming in one giant pond nowadays, and anyone's life could be ours. The essentially universal and unrealistically high standard of comparison decreases the satisfaction of those of us who are in the middle or below, even as the actual circumstances of our lives improve.The moods of happy people improved when they got positive feedback and worsened when they got negative feedback, but whether they heard or didn't hear the feedback given to their partner made no difference. Unhappy people, on the other hand, were very much affected by the feedback their partner received. If a participant got positive feedback, but her partner got better feedback, the participant's mood worsened. …. In a follow-up to this study, Lyubomirsky tried to determine which factors about happy and unhappy people make them respond so differently to the same situation. What she found was that when happy and unhappy people were induced to distract themselves by thinking about something else after they got some negative feedback about performance on a task, the difference between them in their reaction to the news went away: both groups responded like happy people. And if happy and unhappy people were induced, after getting negative feedback, to think about it, the difference between them again went away: this time, both groups responded like unhappy people. The inference here is that distraction versus rumination is the critical distinction. Happy people have the ability to distract themselves and move on, whereas unhappy people get stuck ruminating and make themselves more and more miserable. We can't say for sure in this research what is cause and what is effect. Do unhappy people ruminate more than happy ones about social comparison, or does ruminating more about social comparison make someone unhappy? My suspicion is that both are true -- that the tendency to ruminate traps unhappy people in a downward psychological spiral that is fed by social comparison. Certainly, it is safe to say that, based on available research, social comparison does nothing to improve one's satisfaction with the choices one makes.The distortions incumbent in the desire for control, autonomy, and perfection are nowhere more apparent than in the American obsession with appearance. The evidence is rather compelling that most of us can do little over the long term about our body shape and body weight. The combination of genes and early experience plays a major role in determining what we look like as adults, and virtually all diets tend to produce only short-term changes. These facts about body weight are directly contradicted by what the culture tells us every day. Media and peer pressure tells us that obesity is a matter of choice, personal control, and personal responsibility, that we should aspire to look perfect, and that if we don't, we have only ourselves to blame. According to the culture, if we had enough discipline and self-control we could combine sensible eating habits and exercise regimes and all look like movie stars. That in a typical year American buy more than 50 million diet books and spend more than $50 billion on dieting suggests that most Americans accept the view that what they look like is up to them. The illusion that each person can have the body that he or she wants is especially painful for women, and especially in societies, like ours, in which the ""ideal"" body is extremely thin. When making a decision, it's usually a good idea to think about the alternatives we will pass up when choosing our most-preferred option. Ignoring these ""opportunity costs"" can lead us to overestimate how good the best option is. On the other hand, the more we think about opportunity costs, the less satisfaction we'll derive from whatever we choose. So we should make an effort to limit how much we think about the attractive features of options we reject.I think the power of nonreversible decisions comes through most clearly when we think about our most important choices. A friend once told me how his minister had shocked the congregation with a sermon on marriage in which he said flatly that, yes, the grass is always greener. What he meant was that, inevitably, you will encounter people who are younger, better looking, funnier, smarter, or seemingly more understanding and empathetic than your wife or husband. But finding a life partner is not a matter of comparison shopping and ""trading up."" The only way to find happiness and stability in the presence of seemingly attractive and tempting options is to say, ""I'm simply not going there. I've made my decision about a life partner, so this person's empathy or that person's looks really have nothing to do with me. I'm not in the market -- end of story."" Agonizing over whether your love is ""the real thing"" or your sexual relationship above or below par, and wondering whether you could have done better is a prescription for misery. Knowing that you've made a choice that you will not reverse allows you to pour your energy into improving the relationship that you have rather than constantly second-guessing it.As the number of choices we face increases, freedom of choice eventually becomes a tyranny of choice. Routine decisions take so much time and attention that it becomes difficult to get through the day. In circumstances like this, we should learn to view limits on the possibilities we face as liberating not constraining. Society provides rules, standards, and norms for making choices, and individual experience creates habits. By deciding to follow a rule … we avoid having to make a deliberate decision again and again. This kind of rule-following frees up time and attention that can be devoted to thinking about choices and decisions to which rules don't apply.Despite our romantic images of suffering geniuses who have enriched our civilization, creative by day and tormented by night, there is a growing body of evidence that people think more creatively and expansively when they're happy than when they're not. Giving medical residents a little bag of candy unexpectedly before they engage in a difficult differential diagnosis task improves both the speed and the accuracy of their diagnoses. Happy people are more energetic and physically healthier than those who are not. And happiness adds about nine years to life expectancy. So even if you don't think that happiness is such a big deal in itself, it seems to serve a useful instrumental function. Happy people are more likely than unhappy ones to change the world in positive ways.Perhaps most important, if you limit the number of choices you make and the number of options you consider, you're going t have more time available for what's important than people who are plagued by one decision after another, always in search of the best. You could use that time wisely by getting to know more deeply your lovers, your children, your parents, your friends, your patients, your clients, your students. The real challenge in life is doing the right thing in social interactions. It is knowing how to balance honesty with kindness, courage with caution, encouragement with criticism, empathy with detachment, paternalism with respect for autonomy. We have to figure this balance out case by case, person by person. And the only way to do so is by getting to know the other people you are most closely linked to -- by taking the time to listen to them, to imagine life through their eyes, and to allow yourself to be changed -- even transformed -- by them. In a hurried world that forces you to make decision after decision, each involving almost unlimited options, it's hard to find the time. You may not always be conscious of this, but your effort to get the best car will interfere with your ability to be a good friend. Your effort to get the best job will intrude on your duty to be the best parent. And so, if the time you save by following some of my suggestions is redirected to the improvement of your relationships with other people in your life, you will not only make your life happier, you will improve theirs. It's what economists call ""Pareto efficient,"" a change that benefits everybody."
43,0060005696,http://goodreads.com/user/show/770510-rachelle,4,"Although this book was somewhat repetitive and I found myself skimming some sections, I felt like it provided a lot of interesting insight into the nature of choices. More is not always better and in the case of choices, it seems evident that too many choices can definitely be a negative thing. It is good to have the freedom of choice, but the author argues that it is important to learn how to separate important choices from ones that don't really matter and spend our time and energy on the important ones. When we spend a lot of time on something less important, where to get our pizza tonight for example, pouring too much energy and concern and worry into that choice actually takes away from the actually enjoyment we get from that choice once it is finally made. Another interesting point made by the author is the value in ""embracing restraints"". Following certain rules or patterns frees one up from having to make a decision over and over. Habits and routines can also be useful in freeing up space. I go shopping on Mondays to the same store and often buy the same items. Maybe it's a boring habit but I just do it every week and plan on it and so it gets done with very little work on my part. It frees me up from making the choice each week of when will be the best time to go and where I should shop and what I should buy. Do I miss out on some quality store that I haven't tried or some new product? Probably, but I wonder if the payoff of simplicity and freed up time from choice making may be worth whatever I'm missing out on. The last point that stood out to me is the need to avoid social comparisons. Ha. This is so much more relevant than it was when he wrote the book in 2004. It is so true that I can feel perfectly satisfied with the way I spent my weekend until I get on facebook and see the fun activities my (not real) friends were involved in and suddenly my good feeling about my weekend is swept away in the realization that I may have missed out on something even better. Seeing all of the other choices doesn't make me any happier and may make me sadder so why do I explore them?It's a little bit mysterious. Whenever I think on this topic the image of Mayberry (ya know...Andy Griffith mayberry) pops into my head. I picture many scenes where they'd sit on the porch drinking a soda with a friend as the day turns into night. There was nothing else to do. It seems boring by today's standards. We'd spend our time drinking a soda (who knows how long it took us to select a good drink, maybe something organic or gluten free or at least low calorie) while texting friends and trying to decide between the 1000's of options for something good to watch that night. Then no matter what we chose we'd see the next day that another friend watched a different movie that was totally awesome and we'll feel somehow like we missed out. Some might say that poor Barney and Andy don't know what they are missing out on, but I sometimes wonder if we are the ones missing out on something."
44,0060005696,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29465185-rahul-jain,4,"There's a paragraph at the end of one the chapters where the author (a professor himself) says that he wished his students were less proficient/ less creatively diverse, or bound by some family/cultural/financial/ethical bounds, for the sake of their own satisfaction and well-being. That's a weird thing to say, but as he develops the themes of choice, responsibility, autonomy and satisfaction, it makes sense. One of the takeaways from the book is that a culture which keeps individualism and free market, at the top, can give rise to the notion of self-controlled determinism - that everything is in life is a result of your own choices, and with the right choices we can all be master of our domains (initially applying to America, and eventually to us), which ultimately gives rises to self blame even in situations in which we had no actual control. That self-blame game can also give rise to something like bulimia/anorexia - since the majority of Americans seem to be buying dieting guides (which one can interepret as assuming self-responsibility for their own state of health) - the norm is outside of the question (some of the best minds of the world are busy selling you larger sizes of meals - the norm is shifting) and everybody assumes it is the individual's fault -thus it's the fat (the majority) shaming the fat, everyone assuming responsibility on themselves and then excusing themselves out.Choice in the modern notion is interpreted as autonomy and freedom - which might not be the case. Consider the following situation - the doctor says that there is a 50-50 chance that your kid will survive through intubation - now the choice is yours. The very availability of that choice leads to guilt, no matter what the decision, and the decision can no longer be relegated to back to the doctor without absolving you of guilt. Did you really want that choice in the first place? Why was it offered to you?The only reason I am going with 4 stars is the irony of the number of words here -the book could have easily lost a few pages. Turns out - the author could have easily been a satisficer when it came to the length of the book, but went out maximising. "
45,0060005696,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31980216-vanessa-princessa,3,"I read this book thanks to Blinkist.The key message in this book:Everyday decisions have become increasingly complex due to the overwhelming range of choices that modern society presents us with. As the number of choices increases, so do the negative effects choice can have on our psychological well-being. The more options we have, the more difficult it becomes to make a wise decision, and the less satisfaction we will derive from what we actually choose. Therefore, it seems like some degree of voluntary constraint would make everyone better off. By simply choosing less, chances are that we would be more happy.  Actionable advice from the book:Review your decision makingA simple exercise can help you restrict your options so you are able to choose less and feel better: First, review some recent decisions you’ve made, both big and small. Then, itemize the steps, time, research and anxiety that went into making those decision. This will give you an overview of the costs associated with the different kinds of decisions you make and help you establish future rules governing how many options to consider, or how much time and energy to invest in choosing.Become a satisficerAppreciating and embracing “good enough” will simplify decision making and increase satisfaction. Therefore, think about occasions in life when you’ve settled comfortably for “good enough,” and closely examine how you chose in those areas. Then, start cultivating this “satisficing” strategy in more and more aspects of life. "
46,0060005696,http://goodreads.com/user/show/82901494-samuel-liu,4,"4 stars for the repetitive writing, 5 stars for the content. The book essentially boils down to one theme - that more choices in life amplifies our opportunity cost of foregoing the unchosen options, and hence increases pain. The idea is an interesting spin-off from the broader theme of prospect theory and the idea that human preferences do not align well with what rationality expects.While books like Thinking Fast and Slow and Misbehaving by other behavioural economists address more fundamental problems in decision-making and rationality, this book applies findings in the academic world to our daily lives and provides direct self-help suggestions to readers - which makes the book both a must-read for academics and non-academics altogether. The central idea itself is profound and can be interpreted broadly in other contexts. For example, it explains why Bhutan as an underdeveloped country is (was) the happiest country in the world - stretching the implications more broadly, it challenges our assertion that people living in dictatorships are necessarily less happy because they have less choices in society. What if they are actually happier because there is practically no need to worry about alternative forms of governance? On the contrary people in democracies compare themselves to other democracies constantly (since they have a choice of changing the government) and get upset when their own politicians aren't up to par."
47,0060005696,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69101660-chanh-nguyen,4,"The key message in this book:Everyday decisions have become increasingly complex due to the overwhelming range of choices that modern society presents us with. As the number of choices increases, so do the negative effects choice can have on our psychological well-being. The more options we have, the more difficult it becomes to make a wise decision, and the less satisfaction we will derive from what we actually choose. Therefore, it seems like some degree of voluntary constraint would make everyone better off. By simply choosing less, chances are that we would be happier. Review your decision makingA simple exercise can help you restrict your options so you are able to choose less and feel better: First, review some recent decisions you’ve made, both big and small. Then, itemize the steps, time, research and anxiety that went into making those decisions. This will give you an overview of the costs associated with the different kinds of decisions you make and help you establish future rules governing how many options to consider, or how much time and energy to invest in choosing.Become a satisficerAppreciating and embracing “good enough” will simplify decision making and increase satisfaction. Therefore, think about occasions in life when you’ve settled comfortably for “good enough,” and closely examine how you chose in those areas. Then, start cultivating this “satisficing” strategy in more and more aspects of life. "

Admittedly, Schwartz was preaching to the converted with this one, perhaps that is why I found many parts of the book laborious. I also found that while he spent a lot of time exploring the problems with a cultural obsession with choice and individual freedom, his proposed solutions struck me as 1. sparse, 2. not radical enough. I felt like he could have really gone for the jugular regarding capitalism, individualism and the cognitivist paradigm more generally, but that for some reason he held back.The book is nicely summarized by Schwartz himself in the prologue:- We would be better off if we embraced voluntary constraints on our choice- We would be better off seeking 'good enough' as opposed to the best- We would be better off if we lowered our expectations regarding the outcomes of our decisions - We would be better off if the decisions we made were non-reversible- We would be better off if we payed less attention to what others around us are doing"
49,0060005696,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6006000-melanie,3,"It was ok, interesting but not mindblowing. A worthwile message definitely, which I think has become only more relevant in the 15 years since this book was first published. The book is clearly written and communicates its ideas well, but (as other reviewers have already pointed out) it feels repetitive and a little too... superficial, or simply put maybe? I can't quite put my finger on it.Schwartz does manage to discuss a lot of interesting facets of choice/decisionmaking and their impact on experienced happiness (e.g. maximising/satisficing, opportunity costs/trade-offs, hedonic adaptation, regret), which I think are worth knowing and considering for absolutely everyone, and the book is an easy read. However, I think it would do better in a blog post or essay format; having read the whole book, I felt that reading a synopsis or CliffsNotes version could also have been enough to bring all this information across.

50,0060005696,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1764693-nick-duretta,2,"The premise is an intriguing one: most of us think that more choices are good, but perhaps they aren't. Now, I'm a person who loves to have many options--when it comes to selecting practically anything: wine, automobiles, books, clothes, you name it, I love variety. That doesn't mean that I spend hours and hours agonizing over every decision. Usually a choice pops out pretty quickly. It doesn't mean it's ""the best"" one--but usually it turns out to be pretty good. In the argot of this book, that means I'm a ""satisficer"" -- someone who settles for ""good enough"". The downside of choice applies mostly to ""maximizers"" -- in other words, perfectionists, people who absolutely have to have the best and spend far too much time, energy and mental coin on their choices. Guess which person suffers under having too many choices? Gee, I wonder. This book spent more than 200 pages telling me something that I already knew."
51,0060005696,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8395114-jay,4,"Books like these which leave you with more questions than answers, always deserve a high rating.If you just want the short version, you can view the Ted talk - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VO6XE.... But the book does dive into the psychological concepts of loss aversion, adaptation, learned helplessness, etc. in more detail.Given the age of choice, freedom and autonomy we live in, it is tempting to reject the premise of the book, which attributes problems from dissatisfaction to depression to these elements of a modern society. However, it sure makes a resounding case for the abundance of choice leading to increasing disappointment, especially because of the way humans are psychologically built and our inability to use the freedom prudently. Beware that the pill of increased choice and freedom does not come without its side effects."
52,0060005696,http://goodreads.com/user/show/79646582-lexy,3,"Decent read, however it felt like a lot of the same material was just being phrased in slightly different ways. The whole premise of the book is that the abundance of choice essentially robs us of satisfaction and joy, increases feelings of regret, and can paralyze us from making decisions at all. If the book was cut in half & the fluff was removed it would be excellent.Key points from the book:1. Choose when to choose (decide what’s truly important and deserving of your time)2. Be a chooser, not a picker (make your choices with conviction and purpose)3. Satisfice more and maximize less4. Think about the opportunity costs5. Make your decisions nonreversible (or act is if they were)6. Practice an attitude of gratitude7. Regret less8. Anticipate adaptation9. Control expectations10. Curtail social comparison11. Learn to embrace constraints"
53,0060005696,http://goodreads.com/user/show/103205924-nichita,5,"I have been looking for a book that tackles hedonic treadmills and the impulse to consume more than one needs for a long time. And while I had been hoping for something more rooted in evolution and the lack of adaptation for our current environment, I feel that this book gives concrete information on some of the unintended consequences of market economies. Personally, I consider that the book is a well supported plea for restricting choice to enhance the human experience. While the arguments may seem drab and repetitive, I feel that is being used as a way to reinforce an attitude that is not very common on our advertisement-filled internet. The book also presents a few (slightly too few) actionable steps that any person who has been struggling with choice for a long time can use in order to improve their quality of life."
54,0060005696,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3248186-abhi-yerra,4,"With the amount of choices we have in the modern world I always felt that there was a balance point in between my Indian upbringing of fewer choices and my American upbringing of individualism. Certain choices I make give me happiness and other ones did not. Having the newest tech toy growing up was fun but as I got older I just wanted things that worked. In a lot of ways I discovered the author's prescription for how to deal with the paradox of unlimited choices by my own trial and error. I know what I like to give opinion on and I know what I don't want to put a lot of time on. Especially, now running a company the paradox on choice with limited time can really affect what I need to spend working on and what I need to just let other people do. I still just let my parents buy my shirts, they like doing it and I care very little.I believe it is a valuable read for anyone who is burdened by the amount of choices in the world and their want to limit it.

55,0060005696,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16999257-mai-moanes,5,"This is the kind of book that goes against the mainstream thinking and contradicts what's taken as a given, to uncover the diseased patterns of thinking in our modern world that would never settle for what's good enough and would torture itself to death trying desperately to reach ""the best"" ideal..It lays the argument that the ever-increasing choices available to us nowadays may be not just counterproductive, but paralyzing or even tyrannizing and detrimental to our psychological well-being..On the other hand, he argues that constraints (either self-imposed or put on us by society or religion) may be liberating..A bold enough book with authentic raw advice about how to avoid a major deal of our post-modern misery and to have a peace of mind in an ever-hustling world...... "
56,0060005696,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67621690-john-nelson,4,"I really enjoyed this book, although I'm sure I would have found it to be even better had I not already read Thinking Fast and Slow. Both books reference many of the same studies and draw many of the same conclusions, but in my opinion Kahnneman presents a more compelling argument. Nonetheless, the overlap is only partial, and the rest of the book is fantastic. Schwartz makes a compelling argument that the proliferation of choice has severe negative consequences, and he supports this theory with a wide variety of studies that are fascinating in their own right. Overall, it was an enjoyable read that broadened my understanding of the human condition, and for that it deserves four stars. "
57,0060005696,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5960559-elise,5,Opportunity costs and trade offs. I found this book to be really interesting and liked the way it was written and how the author organized his thoughts and ideas. He takes a look at many studies in different fields. What I found most interesting was how influential a change of phrase or words can have on someone. For example service charge versus cash discount can have on whether or not someone uses cash at a gas station. Both refer to the same concept that using a card will cost you more but we are more likely to go for the discount. I found the whole book to be interesting. 
58,0060005696,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5381913-andrew-wolgemuth,4,"Having watched a Schwartz TED Talk or read an article by him some time ago, I loved Schwartz's thinking but didn't think I actually needed to read his book...and I was wrong. I'm glad that I (eventually) realized this.If Predictably Irrational is a good introduction to behavioral economics, The Paradox of Choice is an excellent initial exploration of the ""irrationality"" that Ariely highlights. Schwartz is a psychologist and his insight into how we make decisions and the hidden/less-conscious reasons for those decisions is incisive. "
59,0060005696,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4905380-sarah,3,"I always struggle with choosing what to read next, so I realized this might be a logical choice. I found this book to be a bit too repetitive for me but I also had already heard of or read about 90% of the research in this book so I guess I shouldn’t be too surprised about that. I’d definitely recommend it to anyone who is not as familiar with psychological research because there are a ton of good insights here. "
