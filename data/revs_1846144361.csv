0,1846144361,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36890366-sud666,5,"Universal: A Guide to the Cosmos is amazing. Broken into several different chapters, it is a journey through time to explain some of the most important scientific cosmological concepts out there. Written by two Physics Professors from the University of Manchester it is at once mind boggling, witty, relatively easy to read (an undergraduate level of science and math help) and engagingly written.While the book does not expect anyone to have a graduate school level of familiarity with the concepts presented-at least an undergraduate, non-major of course, understanding of the subject matter. If this is too much for you and words like calculus or certain basic math is anathema to you-then you will most likely not appreciate this book. Trying to read a science book without getting math/science seems rather redundant to me.But for those of you wondering if your science background holds up- do not worry. This really is a non-technical explanation of high end science. But, even the non-technical version can be daunting to someone with a poor science background. That having been said, I can now state that complexity aside there are truly no other complaints with this superb book.Starting with the Story of the Universe, our authors then break the book into chapters that all revolve around a central point. Each chapter is full of additional notes, graphs and charts along with some basic variants of the math equations. This is done to show that anyone can do these same calculations and get the same answer.The big questions are as follows:How Old Are Things?Weighing the EarthThe Distance to the StarsEinstein's Theory of GravityThe Big BangWeighing the UniverseWhat Happened Before the Big Bang?Our PlaceThis entire book is superbly written and full of dry humor and fascinating facts. The complex science is explained as easily as is possible and a whole new vista of ideas spill out. each chapter has plenty of side information, especially in regards to the actual equations being used. Not to mention gorgeous photos and engaging charts/graphs make this a truly attractive book.The authors seem to realize that the majority of their readers will not be Physics students, so they always approach their subject from the standpoint of an ordinary person. Their use of everyday concepts and the vital questions they answer are the main reasons for buying this book. A truly wonderful book and one I can highly recommend to anyone who has an interest in science and in our amazing universe."
1,1846144361,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,2,"This is really clearly written, it covers fascinating subjects, and the authors have tried really hard to equip readers with the ability to think things through for themselves. They don’t just state conclusions: they lead the reader through how those conclusions were reached, until they are also inevitable for the reader. It’s a smart way to write, although the right people — the people who look at the conclusions and decide they’re wrong without any evidence — probably won’t actually go through the evidence.Unfortunately, a lot of this evidence involves thinking mathematically, which is not a strong point for me. I can hammer something into my head for practical purposes (I can now do a bunch of statistical tests using paper and a calculator!) and I can remember how to calculate something I find interesting (the number of base pairs in a fragment of DNA from how far it travelled during gel electrophoresis), but I’m not good with big concepts. And Cox and Forshaw tackle some of the biggest here.At another time, I might be in the mood to work through this more thoroughly. As it is, I didn’t finish it — not because I think it’s bad (it’s not), but just because this is not the time. Too much for me to learn that’s more immediately relevant.(Remember that my ratings denote enjoyment, not usefulness or interestingness per se. It’s just… maths. Not for me, not right now.)Reviewed for The Bibliophibian."

3,1846144361,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24616271-stephen-flanagan,4,"I took my time with this one as it covers a lot of ground. From weighing the Earth to string theory, this book is a journey through human discovery about our solar system, galaxy, universe, and the possible multiverse. As usual with anything Brian Cox is involved in, these complex subjects are never represented laboriously, and it was a joy to read. long with this, it is a beautiful book, nicely illustrated and it has a unique style of presentation. Highly recommend. "
4,1846144361,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32745288-marwa-shafique,4,"A month or so ago, I felt the urge to discover more about our universe. The picture itself was quite unclear, and I wanted to delve more into cosmology and astrophysics. But I didn't know where to start...until I found this book. And I'm glad I did.It's essentially a beginner's guide to what lies beyond our imaginations: the universe as a whole. I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed reading it, although I did realise how dumb I am when it comes to physics when reading the theories and the like.Highly recommended to those fascinated by Physics; it was quite an enthralling read."
5,1846144361,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44290457-matthew-tyas,5,"An excellent guide to the physics that govern the properties of our world and the universe beyond. Each chapter offers a different question then seeks to answer it with simple experiements and observations, with great adherence to the scientific method. By the end I was left with a deeper understanding of the laws of physics, a basic understanding of inflation, a much better grasp of general relativity and spacetime, and a deep felt desire to learn more.I highly recommend this book."
6,1846144361,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13849607-luis-farrolas,4,Helps to have some basic understanding of mathematics and physics. Very good read - learned a lot.
7,1846144361,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5935582-dan-cohen,4,"Very nicely written and produced, this feels a bit like a coffee-table book but it's also a good read. I really liked the central idea of demonstrating how things are known - using, wherever possible, experiments and calculations that anyone can do. By doing this, the authors provide readers with a much better understanding of scientific method than has been achieved by just about any other book I've read. The second focus on trying to find multiple independent derivations for each result (for example, the age of the universe) is also very effective and generally convincing.The bit that surprised me most was the section making connections between the theory of inflation and the analyses of both the CMB data and observable galaxy distributions. Reading this was the first time that I have found any popular science book or article to be convincing on inflation.A very good book that (like one of Prof Cox's other books I've read) does a good job of moving from a level 1 understanding to a level 2, without jumping into the deep-end of level 99."
8,1846144361,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16831198-wendy,5,"In ""Universal: A Guide to the Cosmos"" Brian Cox and Jeff Forshaw take readers on a journey of discovery, enhancing our understanding of the Universe using science, logical reasoning, and careful observations. It answers questions about our Solar System, Sun, and Earth, looks at Einstein's theory of gravity, and explores whether or not the Universe has continued to expand after the Big Bang.Well thought out, backed by research and uniquely presented with illustrations while highlighting the work of groundbreaking pioneers this book boosts an interest in science as it gives an easy-to-understand explanation about the wonders beyond our Earth's frontier. Impressive with an eye-catching cover and captivating in content although it took time to understand and appreciate some of the more technical parts, I highly recommend it. "
9,1846144361,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4515892-sarah,3,"This book goes into the science behind what we know about the universe, and allows you to do the observations and calculations yourself to test this knowledge. I think you need slightly more than just a basic understanding of physics and maths to understand this book. It is extremely difficult to grasp the theories, calculations and experiments described if you are, like me, someone who remembers a little from school, has watched science programs on TV, and has done a bit of reading at home but not a lot. I think I understood about 10% of what I read. My recommendation would be do not read this unless you have a good understanding of physics (and maths), or it will go over your head like a lot of it went over mine. That being said, I enjoyed some of this, and it did give me a better understanding of the universe. It was just too much for me to thoroughly enjoy it because of how much I skim read and how much of what I read went straight over my head. There are a number of mathematical equations featured, which I also didn't understand. I did none of the maths, either, and though I have access to a telescope, I do not have the interest or inclination to go stargazing very frequently. My rating is based on enjoyment rather than content - as I am not an expert in this subject, I don't feel qualified to rate the content. I picked this book up thinking it would be entry level stuff and it wasn't, so that is partly my fault. That is why I rated this as a three, a middle of the road rating, rather than anything lower or higher."
10,1846144361,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5041904-pak,5,"Great walkthrough of how we deduce the nature of the universeA good primer about cosmology, the book takes you on a journey through our current theories of the universe, and how we deduced those theories. It requires little more than basic mathematics (mostly arithmetic, but some algebra} with some simple experiments that anyone can replicate. There are experiments that aren't so easy to replicate at home as well, but that's the nature of the more advanced topics.The book is written in an approachable, informal, occasionally chatty, style, with plenty of diagrams and call-out boxes that go into some of the more complex ideas in more detail. The authors keep it fairly easy to read and make few assumptions about the reader's knowledge of the subject. There are some minor typos, but they're obvious enough that you can work out what is being described and don't detract from the book as a whole."
11,1846144361,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54231825-christopher,3,"Came to this via Brian Cox's numerous TV appearances, he being the soft-spoken moppet head who's the heir apparent to Degrasse-Tyson when it comes to publicly championing complex ideas. It's hard to beat his easy-going charm and inquisitiveness on TV. When it comes to Universal though, it's likely best to stick with Cox's podcasts. This one is a bit of a slog, as there are sections about difficult ideas (gravitational waves and radioactive decay of Caesium-137) which shouldn't be hampered by a difficult layout (minuscule white font on dark grey background) And it's also a nearly paper-sized tome, which only uses three quarters of a page for text (and 8 or 9 point font in sidebars). But that's just an argument from design - zing. "
12,1846144361,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39648942-martin,2,"I’ve been waiting to get some time to read this for months. While the authors a engaging writers, find they, like nearly all physicists really on a lot of assumptions. I got frustrated by how many sentences start with the phrase “let us assume...” what if that assumption is incorrect? It seems to me that theoretical physics is a faith based system wrapped up in mathematics. It leaves me wanting evidence- which to be fair may come one day, but at the moment there appears to be a lot of snake oil."
13,1846144361,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39453356-katie,3,"I’m sure it’s very interesting for people who understand maths and physics but I way overestimated myself buying this. I was like sPACE, MAN and then I was like oh shoot, this is actually way more mathematical than I thought from flicking through it beforehand. Anyway, I did read it all, and I enjoyed how they explained how conclusions were reached with loads of handy diagrams and descriptions. But honestly this is not quite the kind of non-fic book I will be reading again. Still, very impressive, and the whole subject still bewilders and overawes me! "
14,1846144361,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63344038-william-marler,5,"Along with A Brief History of Time by Stephen Hawking, this was an amazing read. It allowed me to better understand how science can comprehend something as mad as the size of the universe or even how you measure the distance between planets. Admittedly I didn't understand the entirety of the book, but it'll just give me an excuse to re-read it at a later date. I'll certainly be reading more from these two."
15,1846144361,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64086651-carl-barlow,4,"Excellent working-class science, surprisingly clear on subjects that are usually considered anything but (in this Universal is much like the author's earlier book covering quantum mechanics). A quick, thoroughly interesting and engaging read that informs without looking down its knowledgeable nose at you. Naff cover, though."
16,1846144361,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23922865-amina,5,"I thought I would like this book and that it would provide me with some answers about the universe. Instead it raised even many more and for that I loved it. If you want to fall in love with science, physics or even a bit of math read this. If you want to understand the universe and how it came to be, this could be one of the first steps in that journey. "
17,1846144361,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20947171-yates-buckley,5,A very enjoyable book that dashes through the structure of our universe while trying all the time to explain how you get there by looking at simple everyday calculations.I have read many similar books so not much new information but I really enjoyed the grounding of results into everyday measures. I would figure this book is perfect to convert skeptical conspiracists into some form of reason.
18,1846144361,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7692918-rory-parle,4,"Approachable summary of the current state of cosmology. Inevitable you'll have seen much of it before if you've read anything else on the topic, but it also contained some nuggets that were new to me, especially in the later chapters."
19,1846144361,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70776131-alice-connor,5,"Yeah, mind we'll and truly blown! Excellent, took time to try and grasp each concept and piece of reasoning - although I'll admit, as someone with a humanities background I didn't always manage to fully grasp these concepts but it certainly made me think!"
20,1846144361,http://goodreads.com/user/show/77365801-johnathan-day,4,A great book for those interested in the cosmos an space. Yes there is a lot of math equations but you don't need to be a scientist to understand what's being discussed. If your interested in learning more about the universe this is a good book to start with.
21,1846144361,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6937347-colin,4,"Less accessible than their previous work; despite the disclaimers that following the maths wasn't necessary, I found that there were many moments when it was essential - and quite tricky if (like me) you're a bit rusty."
22,1846144361,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50666634-a-o-k-simpson,4,"Think they oversell it a bit with how accessible this book is supposed to be to the layman. None of the maths is that straightforward unless you’re a physicist but it’s interesting nonetheless, especially the end, where the authors discuss possible origins of the universe..."
23,1846144361,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23003532-liam-quinn,3,"I involuntarily read this whole book in the voice of Robin Ince impersonating Brian Cox. That, and the fact that my maths is nowhere near good enough to fully appreciate many of the concepts, means 3*"

30,1846144361,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63371680-jason,3,I hate maths and this has the most complicated of maths all through it. I did learn a few things but maths is like the matrix to me.
31,1846144361,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66654643-ben-causer,4,Amazing but sometimes overwhelmed.
32,1846144361,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58159386-sarah,5,Clearly presented and understandable (despite a lot of the maths going straight over my head). Although the discussion of deities in the last couple of pages seemed incongruous and unnecessary. 
33,1846144361,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73835540-jenny,5,"A simplified version of space, relativity and string theory. Well done Brian Cox for writing this book for those of us who aren't physicists! A great read if you love space."

39,1846144361,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64244698-ryan-van-zyl,4,"Excellent read. Fantastic use of basic concepts in both maths and science in explaining seemingly complex ideas dealing with the universe we live in. At numerous points in the read I was left speechless in comprehending the scale of our universe as I slowly began to understand new ideas as well as come to terms with that which we do not know. Becomes quite a technical read when you get stuck into the application of the maths and science that is introduced, however, the pages turn easily thanks to the beautiful use of imagery created by the authors. Approaching the read with a fresh mind also helps!"
40,1846144361,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63302889-tanai-cardona,5,The joy of science. Beautifully illustrated! Totally recommended to all.
41,1846144361,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21017093-charlene,4,Accessible and enthusiastic. I really appreciated how the authors explain some fairly complex topics in astrophysics and cosmology --and showed readers how scientists work--in a simple and engaging fashion.
42,1846144361,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46788274-travis-williams,5,This book is definitely a step above the average “science for the layman” offering.

47,1846144361,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1695111-a-m,1,I found this incredibly dense - overwhelming amounts of information. Quite disappointed because I generally enjoy Brian Cox's documentaries and conversational style.

As you start it feels great, it's not scary weighing the Earth is informative as it is brilliant.... but then the demented plays into it and before you know it you're in the middle of relativity and Fields, arms and legs everywhere until your lying naked on the floor in the featal position crying for your mammy as multiverse theory scares the bejesus out of you.The illustrations are beautiful."
